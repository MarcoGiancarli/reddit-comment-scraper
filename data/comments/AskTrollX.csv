I've been on hormonal contraceptives so long I have no idea what my periods will be like. As a teen they were really painful. I'm sort of hoping that all these years later my body might be in a different state. The only way I'm going to know is to try it and see.   Does it take a few months to settle in for a lot of people who've tried it? Might it take a bit of getting used to? Thinking about giving six months trial to see how I settle in even if there is a bit of horrible, but don't want to make myself unecessarily miserable.   Any tips on insertion or management?  Any feed back on the strings? I didn't have much trouble with them and was just this afternoon reassuring my partner that it's good that they don't hurt him, but refresher researcher has churned up the snippet of info that the strings soften over time so maybe when I first had my Merina IUD they were worse?    All stories welcomed. Let's see what I can learn."

AskTrollX,3e5549,MamaD_Cooks,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"I had the mirena and switched to the paraguard, so my experience may be similar to yours.   I got my Mirena removed and literally within the hour I could feel the ""hormone fog"" lift off of me. I got my period almost instantly (it probably started by the removal and insertion,  then went right in to my period). The cramps were worse than I had remembered and my flow was very heavy, which is not something I ever had to deal with before. My periods were longer,  heavier, and more painful than they had ever been. After about 6 months they returned to normal - 4-5 Day period, slight discomfort, and back to normal flow. I would give it longer than 6 months,  unless you are absolutely miserable. Everything can return to normal,  it may just take your body longer to adjust."

I suffer from debilitating aura migraines, depression & anxiety, and incredibly painful, what we're 90% sure are sebaceous cysts in my armpits that feel about the size of golfballs and have turned my armpits into a painful, cystic acne hell.   Don't even get me started on my porous teeth that have lead my mouth to be dental hell, which I don't even think Medi-Cal covers anyway.  I'm trying so, so hard not to have a complete mental breakdown knowing I can't have any of this pain addressed or taken away.  Does anyone know where I go from here?

AskTrollX,3e21qm,pk453,3,Tue Jul 21 10:24:59 2015 UTC,"Some things to remember:   Others care about what you do WAY LESS than you think they care. A lot of times what feels like a huge mistake won't even be noticed by others, or they just won't care even if they do notice. Beating yourself up about something will NEVER help. We tend to think that if you ""punish"" yourself, it will make you ""learn"" not to do that thing again. The truth is, it doesn't work like that. It's ok to think logically about it, and decide that whatever you did wasn't the way you want to do things in the future, and learn from your mistakes in that way, but beating yourself up will never help you. All it does is make you feel bad. Stop being mean to yourself! Treat yourself the way you would want a friend to treat herself, or, to put it in another way, if someone was saying the mean things you're saying to yourself to a friend, you would defend your friend, right? So defend yourself from...yourself, and don't say mean things to yourself! :) When you find yourself spiraling down into thinking bad things, bring yourself back to reality by thinking logically. What were the ACTUAL repercussions of what happened? So you made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. Lots of people have made that same exact mistake you made. Did anything terrible happen? No? So what if you were less than perfect? That makes you human! If you re-frame it from ""something bad I did"" to ""an opportunity to learn how to do things better"", it can help."
AskTrollX,3e21qm,omgblvd,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Adding on to the first point made by /u/omgblvd,  It would help me a lot to try to think of a time when one of my friends made a mistake. One on the same level as the one I had made. It does a lot for me.  It takes the focus off of me and my mistake.  If you can think of a few times that happened, think about how you felt about it. Did you even notice ? Did someone else point it out ? Did you even care ? Would you have remembered at all if you weren't trying to think about it ?  If you don't think of any, it's because it went unnoticed or you forgot because it's not a huge deal !   I don't know what kind of mistakes you are making, but mine are mostly like social setting mistakes. I said the wrong thing or I said something weird and everyone stopped talking. I argued too harshly about why we don't need 4 dozen eggs.   Conversation is hard, but if your friends really didn't want to be around you they wouldn't."
AskTrollX,3e21qm,dontlookatmepls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:32 2015 UTC,"So I get caught up in anxiety-producing intrusive thoughts (reliving things from the past or imagining things that haven't happened in the future). One way that I can interrupt those intrusive thoughts and help relieve my anxiety is by reimagining the scenario and changing what happens, often in a ridiculous way.  So, let's say you just totally forgot to pick up your friend from the doctor's office and took a nap instead, and now you feel horrible and so anxious you could just puke every time you see her (even though she doesn't care, and all is forgiven, but you can't get over it).   You could reimagine the scenario, and in your imagination you pick her up from the doctor's on time and book it to the airport where you hop a plane and start a crazy adventure.  And then reimagine it again, and this time when you show up to pick her up there's a crazy cult of clowns barricading the office and you have to karate chop yourself in to save the day.  And then reimagine it again, and this time you fly in on the back of a Pegasus who only speaks in riddles, and you go out for Starbucks after but they won't serve the Pegasus because of their humans-only policy, so you and your friend make a complaint to corporate.  Anyway, the point is that this might help you in a few ways. This is how it helps me:   1) It interrupts the immediate feeling of anxiety in the moment.  2) It desensitizes me to the memory itself--it makes it less likely for the memory to pop up, and if it does the feelings of shame and anxiety are lessened or eliminated."

AskTrollX,3e1a5v,mag3ntaplz,9,Tue Jul 21 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"Several years ago, my then-boyfriend (now-husband) had a dog. She was a nice, if extremely needy dog, and got along with pretty much everyone. But we had to move to the middle of nowhere in some really shitty, tiny loft apartment with no yard for boyfriend's job. Naturally, we took the dog with us, and tried to make it work.   This dog went from living with other animals, and multiple roommates, in a no-rules house, with a yard she could run and sprint in all day. To living in a loft with barely enough room to casually trot around, and could only be let outside on a leash when one of us (who were both extremely busy at this time in our lives) were available to take her on her daily walks. No animals were even remotely around for her to play with. She had also been moved to different houses 5 times in two years (while my SO was working out his roommate and living woes, and then moving in with me, and then us moving out to the middle of nowhere).   The dog became upset and depressed on a daily basis. She constantly whined - I worked from home, and needed it at least moderately quiet while I'm on the phone or making videos all day. All day long, she moaned. Then she started acting out - peeing on everything, chewing things and ripping up things (when she was previously the model of non-chewing perfection). We took her to vets. We got her on anxiety medication. Nothing helped. She was miserable, we were miserable, it was not a happy situation. We fought constantly about the dog - but neither of us were able to make her happy, and in turn, she made us miserable, too.   The real breaking point was when she chewed on a metal crate (that she wasn't even locked into) until her teeth broke and bled.   We all needed a drastic change, so we worked out to give the dog to my SO's  parents - who lived in a huge house, with a maaasssive yard, and two other dogs she could play with all the time. And they had a very stable homelife, so we knew she wouldn't be moving around any more. And we knew SO could visit her any time.   While we were working this out, SO's pretty much entire family assumed it was all me and all my fault. I got a long, nasty email from his mother about how i needed to let the dog have full run of the house (she pretty much did anyway), and that I needed to 'make peace' with the dog for her to be happy. Then SO's brother called him, and told him that I wasn't worth him giving the dog up. That he should give me up and then keep the dog. Nevermind that even if SO did that, the dog would still be stuck in that miserable loft with nothing to do, no one to play with, and now not even a human companion that was there during the 16-hour shifts SO was working at the time.   They both called multiple times and said some really mean things. I actually ended up getting on the phone with SO's mother and explaining to her that she is not my mother, doesn't get to tell me how to run my household, and that maybe she should actually listen to what's going on here instead of jumping to conclusions, and trying to ruin our relationship while we're trying to save this dog a lot of pain. I actually made her cry during that conversation (and do NOT regret it).   Sometimes you're screwed no matter what you do.   But in the end, the dog went to live with his parents. She still lives with them, and she's infinitely happier. She bonded with his dad, and follows him everywhere. It's been a hugely wonderful move for both of them. And now SO and I are married, and his brother hasn't said a negative thing about me since that incident - at least not to me or him. His mother, on the other hand, is still a bit of a battle. She's gotten better, though."

Our only requirement was that she provide a cage for her to go in since we cage our dog at night and when we're gone and she threw a fit about it, showed up without it (both times) knowing we required it for the week-long stay.  When she initially brought the dog in the house, she let it pee all over my carpet and then tried to blame my dog, who was locked up so that he wouldn't be too excited.  I was like WTF?  She told his parents that our house was disgusting and smelled like pot, dishes were piled up etc.  None of it was true.  We do smoke put, but hadn't that day because she was coming over and shes clearly a bitch, and was trying to rat out my SO for smoking even though his mom already knew and didn't care so much.

I'm currently dieting and trying to lose weight and that is my name.  She will regularly call my SO just to complain for 15 minutes (he can literally set the phone down and walk away) and not once ask anything about him, or in the rare instance that she does she immediately starts talking over him anyway about something else related to her.

AskTrollX,3e4leg,MoKix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"Where should I start? I guess a few months ago?  A few months ago, I began to get feelings of disgust about sex. I understood that it is supposed to be pleasant and good but I was put off by the act itself and the male and female genitalia.  I simply shrugged off these feelings and thought that I would get over it soon when I would meet someone and lose my virginity. I was quite sure that many people have felt the same way and I was simply in this group.  As it went by, the feelings became worse. I began to wonder if I should even try be in a relationship due to my adversity to sex. It was strange because I still had sexual fantasies and wanted to fulfill them in real life, however it began to clash with these feelings and this soon became a mentality of ""I want this but I don't actually want this."" Again, I simply pushed these feelings away with the assumption they will eventually dissipate with time.  Apparently my mind hates me because the feelings have gotten more worse to the point where I have started to become ashamed and dirty of having these fantasies. I've never had this happen to me except when I was quite young and even now I find this thought process to be silly. But for some reason I can't really shake it off which is strange.  So this is where I put my foot down on this annoying bizniz. I have been thinking of going back to my therapist for this but I don't really know how to talk about this to her.  Trolls wat do.

AskTrollX,3e1zic,AnimeKilljoy,5,Tue Jul 21 09:53:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a 5'5, 14 year old girl. You might have seen my previous post about my mum making me feel bad about my body. I'm actually 50.2kg, not the 55kg that my mum thought I was. She forces me to do Insanity saying that ""I could benefit from losing 3 or 4kg."" I really like my body and I don't want to lose anything. I just want to do a simple workout so that I maintain my weight. She loses her shit if I don't though, taking away my phone, screaming, stopping me from going out. How do I convince her that I don't need to lose weight?"
AskTrollX,3e1zic,squeakyrobot,16,Tue Jul 21 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you're 110 pounds.  And you're 5'5"".  Your BMI is 18.3.  Underweight is anything under 18.5, so technically, you're already slightly underweight.  You're already underweight and she thinks you need to lose 3-4kg (6-8 pounds)?  Wow.  That's worrying, especially because you're 14 and you're still growing.  Exercise is great for any age, and it's great to get in the habit of being active when you're young - but you don't need to do Insanity, you should be doing a sport of some kind or hiking/walking with friends, not doing a video aimed at adults trying to majorly change their bodies.  If possible, I'd try to go to the doctor and talk to them - have them tell your mom you don't need to lose any weight.  I mean, you need to talk to someone.  Her reaction sounds like abuse."

Your body is growing, and that requires a healthy amount of calories- you should not be worrying about losing weight if you are already a healthy weight, particularly at your age. Involve the school nurse, get a doctor to talk to your mother about it, anything you can do. Do not do any crazy diet or exercise programs. You should be eating a normal, maintenance diet for your weight and getting a normal amount of athletic activity per day."

AskTrollX,3e22go,kmm91,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:39 2015 UTC,"My own father was pretty close to the perfect dad- his few flaws were HUGE flaws, however, god love him. I'll get them out of the way here; he was tremendously impatient, lost his temper very easily, and had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. However, none of those things made him a bad dad, just a flawed person; that said, if you have a problem with any of those things, I suggest trying to improve that now.  What I loved most about my dad was how multifaceted he was- he was a carpenter and built me my own playhouse and tree house. He loved to bake and cook and was tremendously good at it (he even tried REALLY hard to cook for me when I went vegetarian, even though he was a huge meat guy). On that note, he also taught me a ton about our culture including our annual making of lefsa, which is messy and fun and traditional. He would discuss things with me like an adult- politics, the environment, history, etc. and I think it's a big part of why I try so hard to be such a thinker. He would take both me and my sister on individual daddy-daughter dates (from as simple as breakfast to as much as a weekend trip to the river), which is definitely something to keep in mind if you have more children- they're unique little people and like to be treated as individuals as often as possible. He made me more of a feminist, I think, just by being who he was and making me realize that big, manly bikers can love to bake cakes, so, girls can love to do manly things as well. He kept our minds and bodies active by always introducing us to new things- everything from an extensive appreciation of really great film to a love of the outdoors through hiking to teaching us about architecture to so many different interests; I never felt bored as a kid for very long. And he always, always encouraged me; my sister and I ended up very different people and it would have been easy for him to devalue the artsy things I wanted to do because they would be ultimately harder to make money through, but he didn't make me feel doubted. He also brought himself down to our level constantly; I was always surprised how many of my friends dads didn't play with their kids. Like, what do you mean your dad doesn't run through the sprinklers with you?? He doesn't play video games or play with legos or join you excitedly on every ride at amusement parks?? I was pretty sure my dad was having more fun than me half the time! Sometimes to be a good dad, you have to be a big kid. And, lastly, hopefully most obviously, he made me feel loved; my dad made my lunch everyday from kindergarten to senior year of high school and every day wrote me a note on a post-it; sometimes it was ""Have a good day! -Dad"" or ""I love you. -Dad"" or, my favorite, on my bulletin board right next to me roughly 7 years after it was written and roughly 4 years after losing him, ""Thank you for just being you. I love you very much. Happy v-day. Love, Dad"". It's not enough to love your child; expressing it every way you can is so, so important; never let the fact that you love them feel like a secret.  Congratulations on becoming a father soon <3 The fact that you're trying to figure out how to be a great dad is already a sign that you can do this <3"

AskTrollX,3e17nl,doahhh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"I’m taking a swimming class at university next semester and I’m really excited. But I’m considering not shaving my legs for the class, and I’m not sure if that’s a good idea. I’ve never seen a girl on campus with unshaved legs (although I’m sure there are many ladies who go unshaven under their pants and tights.) I’m worried people will harass me or bother me about it. I just don’t like shaving. I never have. I did it out of necessity for years, and then when I got sick of it, I just wore pants all the time. I’m a very hairy woman and my leg hair grows back to the point that it’s visible literally within 2-3 days. Shaving feels like  a pointless waste of time since it all comes right back anyway, and on top of that, I’m prone to razor burn and I really don’t like the idea of chlorine + freshly shaved legs. Ouch. This doesn’t mean I’m just going to stop shaving altogether forever, but I might make it like once every week or two instead of daily. It’ll help that I’m wearing trunks/board shorts, but still.  Have any of you done this? Do people bother you? I know it’s one thing to go around in public with unshaved legs, but I feel like being in the pool it’ll be all the more noticeable."
AskTrollX,3e17nl,hkaps,4,Tue Jul 21 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to shave your legs, don't shave your legs. It's fine! Even if it bothers some people, that's not your problem - it's theirs. If anyone is rude enough to mention it to you, you can either politely tell them that it's none of their concern, or come up with a few zingers to keep in the back of your mind (I'm sure our Troll sisters can oblige).   The bottom line is, it's your body, and you can do (or not do) whatever the fuck you want to it. You rock those legs! Be confident, or fake it til you make it!  As an afterthought...sure, some people might notice, but the truth is that when you get a bunch of people together in their bathing suits, I'd wager that most people will be thinking mostly about what their own body looks like and their own small bodily insecurities."
AskTrollX,3e17nl,katcherintherye,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:00 2015 UTC,I took a swimming class at my university. Most likely no one will say anything. You'd be surprised how many people don't regularly shave their legs.  I wouldn't worry about it. And if someone says something to you just tell them it's your body and your choice!  Edit to add: I don't shave my legs regularly and the other day I went to a restaurant wearing a really cute dress that cuts off at my knees and no one looked or said anything.  I wear that shit proudly now! I used to be nervous but it is what it is - I've accepted my body for every prickly hair :)

(the only one who talkes about my hairy legs is my sister,  and she had no response to my reasoning).    So if your being harassed by your legs mention it's part of a condition!  It's crappy that (to some people) you can't just say ""because I don't want to shave my legs"", and have them be satisfied at that.

If someone actually says anything to you then they're the rude person and you can tell them they should mind their own business and not be rude. But I've mostly only encountered the stank face and with that you never really know if that's about the thing you're self conscious about or they just don't like your face or they need to fart or something.

AskTrollX,3dy0m3,calliope728,19,Mon Jul 20 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"MY personal preference is to bob along, oblivious to my true feelings (because if I pay too close attention to how I'm feeling, I'm gonna have to deal with it, see?), until I boil over into a grumpy, weepy, confused mess. And THEN I figure out what the matter was. Helpful, right?!  But. Sometimes... sometimes I figure it out. I used to think that if I didn't like my SO exactly the way they were, that it meant I had no business being with them, because who am I to ask them to change? But relationships are give and take, and likely, you're in one because being with that person makes you a better person, and vice versa for them. And you want them to be happy! BUT that doesn't have to come at the expense of YOUR happiness. Just because you ask for what you want doesn't make you selfish. And man, asking for what you want makes you feel sooo much lighter, more enjoyably committed to the relationship.  I have a hard time asking my boyfriend for quiet time. He talks non-stop until we fall asleep, and then starts back up as soon as we wake up. I like to read before bed, and drink a nice cup of tea in the morning, in silence. Do I feel like a wet-blanket bitch when I ask for quiet? Sometimes. But dude, I will BECOME a bitch if I don't get the quiet time I need to recharge.   Do you feel insecure when you ask him to talk to you more often? Sure, but you will BECOME more insecure if he doesn't contact you frequently enough. May as well try asking for what you want.  Worst case scenario? He thinks you're too needy and kicks you to the curb. Guess what?! He wasn't right for you. The worst thing that happens when you bear your true feelings is that he doesn't want them, and you find out sooner that he wasn't right. There's no sense pretending to be someone you're not (""The Cool Girl"" -- ""Oh, you can't skype me for a month? No worries! You don't want any 'strings' attached right now, because you'd like to see what your options are? Me too!"" -- when you're actually feeling the opposite of okay), just to have your authentic self come out in the wash later on.

AskTrollX,3dy0m3,foxsweater,6,Mon Jul 20 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, This is something I have struggled with a lot too - I even talked about it with a counsellor. One of the things she asked me was ""What do you think would happen if you did [tell your SO]?""  When I stopped thinking about how frightening it would be to try to talk to him, and actually imagined how he'd react if I did, it forced me to think more rationally about the situation. My SO is a very understanding person; he would never react badly or meanly to me telling him almost anything. Because I was able to imagine a positive outcome, it became possible to imagine actually broaching the subject.  1) You wanted to know how to feel more comfortable taking that first step; imagine actually having the conversation.  2) Where does your anxiety come from? These feelings are a response to some stimulus. Properly identifying the source can really help, especially if your fears are based on things outside your relationship. For example, your ex's behaviour does not predict your current SO's behaviour.  3) You said:   My feelings just don't line up with what I think is right in this case at all.   You are invalidating your own feelings; you are saying ""I am not allowed, because these feelings are wrong."" You are inflicting shame upon yourself. But here's the thing: your emotions are not your opinions. You don't get to choose your emotions. You do get to choose how you behave. It's possible to recognize your feelings; it's okay to have them. If you think you feel something unreasonable, it's okay to recognize that. Even to discuss it with your SO. By talking about it, you may lessen that bad feeling anyways. Sometimes you can't/shouldn't get what you want; that doesn't mean you can't say ""I would like this, even though I don't expect to get it."""

It helps to hear me say the worlds and formulate my thoughts and in general I feel better afterwards without having to actually engage in a conversation. Mostly I broach the subject with him the next day but not always, sometimes I get it out of my system and realize its not as important as I thought it was.  I read an article from a marriage counselor who suggested this and so far it has been helpful :)"

AskTrollX,3dy0m3,elanasaurus,11,Mon Jul 20 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"That's how me and my bf of 5 years made it ""official"". Getting drunk and yelling at each other in the parking lot of the bar.   ""Am I your girlfriend now or what?"" ""Yeah, I guess so!"" ""Ok!"" ""Cool!""  Ahh, romance."
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,breannabalaam,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that's been my strategy as well...so far it hasn't completely wrecked the relationship I'm in.
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,Lesbian_Drummer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:08 2015 UTC,Same.  Besides I didn't want to have the convo over text or the phone and I'm not going to see him again until Thursday because fuck my work schedule.
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,calla_allac,10,Mon Jul 20 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"I try to turn it into a joint problem solving session.  We're a team.  We solve things together.  So step one is to talk about how I'm feeling about something.  THEN step two is to problem solve together.  But the problem solving is NOT allowed to happen during the airing of feelings.  They are separate.  I know sometimes men have a hard time understanding that listening needs to happen before problem solving, so I don't know how much luck you'll have with that.  I married another woman, and we both understand the need to listen to the other until we're done, and then try to solve whatever problem it is."
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,SebaceousSeabass,5,Mon Jul 20 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Somehow I read ""joint problem solving session"" and thought.... stoner couple chilling sharing a joint and talking about their feelings.... but this approach sounds helpful too!"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,raziphel,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"I like this approach! It reminds me of the Positive Discipline approach to parenting. I just feel super uncomfortable doing anything like that with him right now, it's too early in the relationship"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,looksnormal,5,Mon Jul 20 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Are you judging ""too early"" based on what you think he wants? Or based on what you want? Or based on what you think is acceptable in your culture?   Speaking from experience, I can promise that anything you don't talk about now will build up into a larger problem. You'll be thinking about it more and more, it will start to affect the relationship, and you'll be come more nervous over time because it will have become such a big thing in your head. Meanwhile, your partner doesn't have an idea of what's going on in your mind. I am not saying it's ever easy to be vulnerable like that, and I understand you're worried about how he'll react. But I can promise you that you'll gain much more from asking now rather than waiting for the right time. There are no rules about how soon you talk about things in a relationship (and you're going to get hundreds of differing answers on reddit).   Sure, everyone takes things at their own pace, but it's really worth it to find out sooner than later what the other person wants. Plus, it shows you whether you guys are able to talk about serious stuff and gives you more insight into how the other person thinks."
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,SebaceousSeabass,5,Mon Jul 20 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"I have a really hard time expressing what I want or need in a relationship! I don't know how to become more comfortable asking for what I want, and I don't know what the best way to ask is.  I'm in a LDR and I tried to politely request that we talk more frequently last night. It probably went OK but now I'm freaking out and think he's going to abandon me because I'm ""needy."" Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,looksnormal,4,Mon Jul 20 13:44:07 2015 UTC,"The only way to get more comfortable asking for what you want is to do it.  Practice makes perfect.  You're not needy- asking for more time together, especially when it is very limited, is a perfectly reasonable request.  Whether it can happen is a different issue.    Assuming motivation and intent on his part should be avoided.  Brains, especially anxious ones, jump to bad conclusions very quickly when there is no reason to.  If you don't have more time to talk on the phone, try writing letters or sending little gifts to each other, like cookies, cards, and things of that nature."
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,Giraffe247,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"How did he respond? I think the responses of various guys I was seeing was, if not negative, still not positive, and it led me to be anxious about asking for things. I'm with someone now who helps me feel comfortable when I discuss things I'm uncertain of, and trusting that he'll be respectful and calm makes it so much better (he doesn't have to agree to make it positive and calm. Just his attitude). I guess I'm asking: can you trust him to respond positively to things you ask?"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,Cronoan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"He was respectful and calm. I just don't think he is able to give me much more time because he works so much.  Now I feel stupid because I think I've hurt his good opinion of me. I also feel like if I ask for something, the answer is always going to be ""no"" and then you've made yourself vulnerable and hurt the relationship, so what's the point of asking?"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,Cronoan,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"Reading your posts is like hearing myself talk. I just want to remind you that it's okay to want what you want! Long distance relationships are hard, and they're especially hard for people like you and me. I know nothing about your relationship but it sounds like the only person shaming you for wanting something is you. Sometimes it helps to share how vulnerable you feel when you ask for something like that (although don't go overboard with the self bashing). It helps the other person understand where you're coming from and maybe give you the outside reassurance that you're not crazy for wanting things. Remember that your boyfriend has only heard what you told him - he isn't in your  mind where you're thinking about this a lot more than you've let on."

And I don't think I should be saying this, cause I know I'd not have listened.   But if you can't get what you want, if you can't ask, what are you getting? When do you get to expect a joyful ""yes""? A relationship shouldn't be hurt by such little things as asking. It shouldn't make you feel bad for wanting togetherness."

AskTrollX,3dy0m3,nerdyjellyfish,4,Mon Jul 20 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"I like to actually have that talk pretty early once we decide we want to be serious. Make a simple, concise list in your mind. What do you need in a relationship to be happy? Do you have any ground rules about flirting and some other gray areas? I have found that men tend to respond very well when you are up front about what you want from them. There's room for adjustment in the relationship when you feel like something is missing or you would like something more, but it's good to lay out some basics early on! You're not needy!   If you're not just starting out and you're comfortable together, then I would suggest you just make it clear that you're happy and you like him, and you would just like to hear from him more often. Is he too busy for you guys to talk much? I've done LDR relationships before. I dated a Swedish guy online for 2 years and only saw him 4 times, so I know that good communication is utterly critical. Just try to keep it simple and make sure you're willing to compromise if he has time constraints or really enjoys his freedom.  As for being comfortable asking for anything, it's not easy. But you have to remind yourself that if you're gonna be in it for the long haul you can't start settling now for less than what you need. You wouldn't want him to do that for you, so speak up and let him know your desires. Remember that you're worth any extra effort he might have to put in, just as he is worth it for you. If you don't say anything, then he won't know.   EDIT: I just remembered an issue I used to have in another LDR I had more recently. This guy was really busy and he had trouble spending any time talking to me. And he was under the impression that if he or I didn't have an hour to talk then we shouldn't talk at all. We were utterly lacking in small talk (How was your day? etc), and it was actually hurting the relationship. After some research, I found out the reason is cause non-LDR couples have small talk when they come home to each other from work or lie in bed after a long day. Or maybe they go out on a quick lunch date on a busy day. LDR couples have to work harder to incorporate that casual intimacy into the relationship, but it's very important to have it. Maybe that's what you're missing and why you want to hear from him more?"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,katiebug88,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"Is he too busy for you guys to talk much?   His job has him working really long hours, which I totally understand. But he doesn't always tell me ""Hey, I'm working until 11 today, thinking about you"" he just doesn't contact me at all if he's busy. And I hate the way that feels.   You wouldn't want him to do that for you, so speak up and let him know your desires.   I wouldn't want him to do that, I would be pretty disappointed if he wanted something from me and didn't ask. But I feel like I'm the woman, so I don't get to ask for anything. I just have to accept what he wants to give me and deal with it. I don't know where these feelings come from, and I don't think they are right, and they are really bothering me.  Thanks for your advice, I appreciate it!"
AskTrollX,3dy0m3,katiebug88,6,Mon Jul 20 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're fighting against some pretty deeply ingrained notions of the woman's role in the relationship. I used to do that shit, it made me AND my boyfriends miserable. Try to work on not applying labels to yourself or him. Be yourself and be natural and stop telling yourself what's expected of you. You matter, what you want matters, and you need to stop talking yourself into and out of things.   I know you don't want to think the way you have been and you want to get away from these poor ideologies. But there's a big rule in psychology that if you want to change your mental habits, first you have to change your actions. And it's like magic the way your brain can reprogram itself. If you just practice speaking up and thinking of yourself, it'll be hard at first but you will be able to slowly let go of all these misapprehensions about how you should be, and you'll start behaving the way you want to be. I'm rooting for you!"

You have as much choice as he does. You do you do you do. (I'm half talking to previous me who gave up so much to fit the boyfriend's expectations, but got very little back.

Most people I know who've gotten into their program of choice have made contact with someone first (Networking!!!) and basically sealed the deal on the advisor, then went through the ""formality"" of applying.  This approach is much easier at your local in-state university than, say, an Ivy League school or some other elite program.

We had been really flirty, and even though he's socially inept he's a nice guy (legit nice, not ""nice guy"" syndrome). Total nerd. Did I mention socially inept? I had a feeling that, come Friday afternoon, he was going to ask me out to dinner. Not being one to sit and wait on Captain Socially Awkward to call, I made dinner plans with my bff, with the understanding that if he called we would all go. Which is precisely what happened at about 4 pm Friday afternoon.  Bff and I are at my apartment and he picks us up. She gets a little ticked that he doesn't open the car door for me, but I don't mind. We go to a little Chinese place just off campus. Something happens and my spoon is on the ground. He could turn around and get me a new spoon from the silverware station just behind him, and bff keeps dropping not entirely subtle hints that he should. (I was on the inside of the booth, so I couldn't get up unless he did.) She finally gets me another spoon.  The rest of dinner is pretty uneventful. Everyone pays their own way, which again bothered bff but not me. She felt like he should have at least offered to buy my dinner. Anyway. We walk down the block and around the corner to the car, which she and I realize is parked on a poorly lit side street, almost an alley. It wasn't dark when we got there so we hadn't noticed before. There's a guy (homeless?) begging for money. Lots of them in the city, so nothing we aren't used to. Date doesn't have a remote to unlock his car. Ok, fine. But he goes and unlocks the driver door. Gets in, closes the door. Gets comfy. Puts on his seat belt. Turns the car on. Adjusts the radio. Then he finally unlocks the car so the two of us could get in. Creepy beggar man is still trying to get money from us this entire time!  I, uh, wish I could say that was my first and last date with him. I gave it a few more proper dates, without bff, and gave up on him. He said ""I love you"" on Tuesday - four days after the Chinese restaurant. Poor sad puppy. I just didn't feel the same way."
AskTrollX,3dw3ud,Sigh_No_More,20,Mon Jul 20 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"My friend set me up with an acquaintance of hers. We set up a time to go hang out during the day. He had this SUPER AWESOME GREAT IDEA THAT I WAS GOING TO LOVE. We went to see his old high school volleyball team play. He talked about Magic the Gathering and volleyball all the way there, all the way back, and the entire time we were there. I don't know or care much about either of those topics. He DID ask me a couple questions though... about sex stuff.   THEN he pulled the same shit on my friend (the one who'd originally set us up. She's... really socially oblivious sometimes), and it turns out he just told the EXACT SAME STORIES and used the EXACT SAME LINES on both of us.  AND THEN he tried to manipulate my friend and me into fighting over him (didn't work, obviously), told us there was a 3rd girl we were ""competing"" against (another of my friend's acquaintances. At this point neither my friend nor I gave a single fuck about this guy), then told her weeks later that she'd ""won"" him, and she basically laughed in his face.  And that's the story of the worst date I've ever been on."
AskTrollX,3dw3ud,sarasmirks,19,Mon Jul 20 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"I meet up with a dude from OKCupid.  He spends the entire date in various states of extreme insecurity. High points include me complimenting his rockabilly creeper type shoes and his response is ""I have to wear them because I'm short,"" and him refusing to remove his hat for the duration of the date including while eating indoors, AND including when attempting to lean in to kiss me. When questioned about it he told me he didn't want to take his hat off due to thinning hair/receding hairline.   WTF, did he think he was just going to keep the hat on for our whole relationship? During sex? At our wedding? In the delivery room?  The worst part is that he was a nice enough guy, he just could NOT talk about anything aside from his own insecurities the entire time. IIRC there were some typical ""nice guy"" isms peppered in there, too. Like, dude, do NOT tell the woman you're on a date with all about how women don't want a nice guy, they want a badass who hurts them. YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO SEX. SO. CLOSE.  It was a fedora, needless to say."
AskTrollX,3dw3ud,Zavarakatranemi,16,Mon Jul 20 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I accidentally ended up on a date once, and it was by far the worst date I have ever been on.  I dated for a while a very jealous guy, the ""who was that on the phone, how do you know them, and has there ever been anything between you two"" kind. He overheard me making plans with friends, and did not believe me when I explained to him it was all girl friends. He then insisted he comes with me because ""if it's your friends, I don't see why I can't hang out with you"". I tell him no, it will only be girls, and he keeps asking questions that basically show me he is convinced it is a date with a guy. Really now.  So the night of the ""date"" I am hanging out and goofing around with my girls, and lo and behold he shows up with a ""omg Zavara I didn't know you were here! But now that we're both here, let me meet your friends"" lame excuse. My friends are all very brutal bitches when they want so they call him out on the bullshit, and he continues with the ""no no it was accidental that we ran into each other, I am here to meet a friend""... which as luck would have it ""stood him up"". After a few more minutes of giving him hell, I figured whatever, let him hang out for a bit.  We all tried to include him in our conversation, my friends asked him things, we tried to joke and laugh with him, but he was just grumpy and only replied and addressed me. After a while, my friends just ignored him and we continued our night as if he wasn't there.  I go to the bathroom, and I come back to find my friends getting up from the table, with my stuff as well. Apparently while I was gone he asked them to leave, told them they were ""ruining our date"" and ""why were they there in the first place, this is supposed to be a night out for a romantic couple"". My friends, being awesome and all, told him they were all in love with me and he was the odd one out and they had plans for all of us to rent together and have wild lesbian orgies every weekend - which not only he believed, he was hurt about it later as well!  3 months in total, I don't know how I lasted this long. I did get my revenge though in the end, so ha!"

He was still living with his parents, feeding off their estate, but ah well, I fell in love with his eyes; unfortunately got stuck with the whole package. He was unbelievably controlling, over-the-top jealous, and he kept invading my every moment (i.e. found out where I was having dinner with some friends, ""showed up by coincidence"" to check if there were guys in our company, stayed without being invited).  At some point, I found out by his friends how he bragged that ""hey, an 18yo is fucking me"". I let it slide because, well, we were having sex a lot, but my interest levels were getting lower and lower by the day. One night, while in the act, as he was going faster and harder, he slipped and went in my butt. All the way in. Full throttle. It was the scream heard around the world. But after asking if I'm OK (I said no) and waiting 30 seconds, he kept going. In my ass. That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I spent the next weekend at his place, his parents would come back around Sunday afternoon. Sunday morning, after breakfast and some relaxing time, I put on my sluttiest smile and asked ""So, do you want to see how it feels to really be fucked by an 18yo?"". He got instantly hard, so I lead him to his parent's bedroom and pushed him on the bed. I gave him my naughtiest look as I was going down on him, and he put up little resistance as I tied his legs to the bed. Handcuffing him on the railing was even easier. And right as I was about to mount him and ride him to oblivion, I stopped, got out of bed, and reached in my overnight bag. Got my eyebrow tweezers out, and got to work.  He wasn't particularly hairy, but there was quite a lot at the base of his penis, as well as his ball sack. For every hair I pulled, I gave him the reason why. It took him a while to realize that the more he swore and cursed at me, the slower I was pulling the hair out. At the final few he was quietly suffering, so I knew he got the point. I got dressed, looked at him lovingly, told him ""THAT'S how it feels to be fucked by an 18yo"" and left him there for his parents to find.  TL;DR Used eyebrow tweezers in a fun and creative way!"""

I thought I'd been doing a good job fending off the people who just care about about my hair colour, but I ended up playing pool with one guy who asked if my hair was natural because he's always wanted to date a redhead.

The dog has little flowers clipped on the fur around her ears and a pink collar. I thought it was funny, and kinda giggled while asking about the dog. He said it was his ex's and he was taking care of it for her.  I love dogs, so I didnt press it. I ask if it's okay for a dog to eat sushi, he says ""She loves it! Who cares if it's good for her or not?"" Again, not my place so I move on. Our waitress comes over and asks if I want wine as it's part of the happy hour special. I hesitated for maybe 3 seconds and guy says ""Come on! YOLO!""   I pass on the wine and decide to just ride this one out and see what else happens. He then tells me that his ex wife left the dog at his house last night when she was dropping off his kids. His profile said nothing about kids and I remember specifically asking him if he had kids or had been married. He said no to both when we were talking before the date. I ask him about that and he says ""Well, Im not married now, and she's taking the kids to Australia this summer so it's my last time seeing them for like a year anyway.

Three months later, he texted me and asked me out, and I said yes because I didn't get asked out much and my friend convinced me it's worth a shot, he's not totally ugly and, you know, who knows. We went to go see a movie, which I was almost late for, and afterwards we went somewhere to talk since I knew pretty much nothing about the dude other than his name. I still don't. Getting a word out of him was like pulling teeth. I just kept trying to ask open ended questions, and getting strained one word answers in response, usually after about thirty seconds of awkward silence. This went on for about twenty minutes and I finally gave up.   I feel bad for the guy, he clearly had some serious social anxiety problems and good for him for even getting up the nerve to ask me, honestly, but he was not ready to go on a date and I sure as hell wasn't ready to fix him or whatever.

AskTrollX,3dvb90,mmwright82,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:45 2015 UTC,that sounds good!!!  So do you find that you have time for lots of hobbies and friends? How do you find meaning in life? if I dont want to have kids will I find life meaningless?
AskTrollX,3dvb90,missprecocious,3,Sun Jul 19 23:46:21 2015 UTC,"I find meaning in life by doing things that I enjoy, spending time with people who make me happy, and going on adventures. I am 33 and have no kids- life is far from meaningless. Not having kids, for me at least, means that I have the ability to make bigger plans and the expendable income to actualize the plans. Right now I am planning a buddy adventure with one of my child-free friends where she and I will ride our motorcycles to South America. And I'm planning a trip to Thailand with another friend. These arent things that i could do if i had kids.   My life is far from boring and far from meaningless. But this is just my adventure. Find out what makes you happy and go do it. Maybe you love knitting and watching Netflix and ordering pizza. Awesome! As long as you feel good about it, you can create meaning out of anything. So- spend some time getting to know you. Dream big. Take chances. Be fearless. Make yourself happy every day. At the end of the day, the only person you have to prove anything to is yourself. So make sure that you enjoy you. :)"
AskTrollX,3dvb90,mmwright82,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"thanks, that makes me feel ok about life :) that sounds like lots of fun. I dont want kids either but I am worried that I will be 40 or 50 one day and regret it, because kids are like a thread of a constant thing that runs though your life - maybe i will feel like that is missing."

Then I think about my older gay friends. They never had kids. And their lives still seem awesome. So why aren't they ""missing out"" on having kids?  Because they have a different set of priorities. They have a good group of like-minded friends, they have stable and loving partners, they have kids in their extended families, they have their hobies, and they remain active in their community. My friends have found value in things beyond reproduction- and that is inspiring and reassuring.   Disclaimer: comments are ancdotal and about my specific friend group. I am in no way attempting to make a blanket statement about any social group beyond my own set of buddes."

AskTrollX,3dvb90,devobat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:13 2015 UTC,I agree - I think also for gay people it's 'ok' to be childfree - so they dont suffer from the wondering if they made the right decision
AskTrollX,3dvb90,nbyevu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I am sure that regardless of sexual orientation, people struggle with the decision about having kids. As a straight female, I experience more societal and familial pressure to breed vs my gay friends where it isn't expected. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't cross their minds. I think that if it weren't for the external pressures, I would have significantly less doubt."
AskTrollX,3dvb90,creamcheesefiasco,3,Mon Jul 20 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"Not who you replied to, but that really depends on you! I think one of the hardest parts of being done with school is the ""what now?"" feeling. But you find things to make your life meaningful! You can spend more time with family and friends, learn or work on hobbies you never had money for, volunteer, save all your money to go on big adventures, really just start doing whatever you value! You probably will feel a little lost for a while. And that's okay! I'm still there, but I'm happy, and I'm spending my time trying out some new things hoping one of them will stick!"

AskTrollX,3dvomw,killertofuuuuu,2,Sun Jul 19 22:34:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm...this is an intriguing and difficult question. I think one of the best ways to self-discovery and self-betterment is a willingness to try new things and have new experiences. Becoming a better person isn't just about a quick fix. It's an ongoing process. Finding your strengths and passions helps you grow into a more confident and interesting person, which I think makes people inherently more 'likable'. But, self-confidence must also be tempered with compassion. I think a huge part of life is figuring out how to strike a healthy balance between extremes.   On a more practical note, consider the types of people you like to be around or admire. What are some of their traits? How can you emulate them. Again, I think being open to new things is important and will help you grow and figure out what kind of person you want to be. But perhaps the biggest advice I can give is that you should be good to yourself. No one is done growing and everyone makes mistakes. Screw ups are important learning opportunities. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses and part of growing is figuring out what your strengths are and how to maximize those.  I hope this helps."
AskTrollX,3dvomw,BantlingBee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Hang out with people who have qualities you admire, that seems to work for me. It normalises the desired behaviour and makes the things you're not proud of something you identify, work to minimise, and stop being part of your behaviour.   That's assuming that personality is behaviour - I'm not sure what personality is, other than behaviour through which one expresses the individual."
AskTrollX,3dtdzh,pinkmagedon,15,Sun Jul 19 07:15:24 2015 UTC,"If there's a dental school in your area, you can often get worked on by students (in a supervised environment!) for steeply reduced prices. I live near Boston and Tufts dental school is where a decent number of uninsured or underinsured people get dental care."
AskTrollX,3dtdzh,FlackBox,10,Sun Jul 19 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who let their dental needs go unmet for years and now has thousands of $ in work that needs to get done (and maxed my dental out at the 2nd appointment), get it taken care of ASAP. If it's just a cavity (even a big one), it won't be too awful. It'll be expensive, but not root canal, buildup, and crown expensive. If you do need those things, just remember that if you don't bite the bullet you will be in pain and it will make cleaning the surrounding areas more difficult leading to more decay. Fillings fall out; they aren't invincible (I've had quite a few fall out).  Definitely look into CareCredit. You say further up that your credit isn't great, but see what you can get. They give you a ""promotional period"" for every big purchase where you don't pay any interest. If you pay it all off in that time you never have to pay interest. Also, sometime dentists will charge you a little less than what they would if they were billing the insurance (at least mine does this).   The only perk of not having insurance is being able to choose your dentist and not have to worry about whether they're in network or not. So you can look around for someone that has all good reviews or that people you know recommend and not be worried they're gonna do a bad job.   Good luck and don't panic!"

Medi-Cal is free or low-cost health, dental and vision coverage for children and adults with limited income and resources.

AskTrollX,3dtdzh,OtherRunner,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"If it's in the back (which it sounds like it is from a quick read through this thread) and it's beyond just needing a new filling (you need a crown/root canal which will run you +$1000), there's always the last defense of just having it pulled. That's usually less than a hundred bucks. It's not ideal but if it's in the back it's better than having a big decaying hole in your mouth that will eventually start to stink and could cause a lot of problems and pain.   Other than that, everyone else here has some good suggestions. Best of luck to you."
AskTrollX,3dtdzh,SoJenniferSays,2,Sun Jul 19 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"When I had to deal with some dental stuff without insurance, I put it on my credit card and swallowed the cost.  But lots of places do payment plans, and if it's something that can wait, you could try saving for a couple months, maybe?  I initially went to that dentist for a cleaning and x-rays on a groupon.  $50 for everything (no fillings or anything, but I hadn't been to a dentist or gotten a cleaning in a whiiiiiiile)."
AskTrollX,3dtdzh,MadMagicks,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:12 2015 UTC,I have never had dental insurance but if I am paying cash they usually charge me less than they would bill insurance. My brother was able to work out a payment plan for some major dental work and that was at a normally expensive practice. They didn't do a credit check either.   I shopped around and had a pretty significant cavity taken care of for under $150. My mom went to the same dentist and they billed her insurance over $300 for basically the same procedure.

Soooo much better now!   Then of course my doc switched me to continuous BC so it's a none issue except a handful of times a year if that.
AskTrollX,3dr0ty,Cuppiecakes,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:19 2015 UTC,I trim with scissors around there but leave it as everything else irritates it. Shaving is like sitting on a cactus!

I actually subscribed to a kind of digital scan of it as opposed to just reading their website as I like skimming over it and the feeling of completion.

I also like to just look up strange facts about things I'm interested in. Knowing really ridiculous things makes me appear intelligent, and I can usually contribute something to any conversation I'm in.   For example, before toothpaste, some armies brushed their teeth with ground up glass and urine, since urine was considered sterile.   I think it also helps to just look up basic knowledge on a bunch of topics you might not know anything about. I didn't know anything about football, but my old boss was obsessed and would stream football games at work on Sundays. After not being able to contribute for awhile, I picked a team and brushed up on general knowledge about the team and football in general. Now I'm a casual Seahawks fan (coincidentally, a week after I claimed them as 'my team' they started a winning streak and went to the playoffs that year. I'm from the Midwest, so my pick is pretty unusual, but I can offer up some stuff about them) and I try to keep up to date on scores and basic stuff."

But I highly recommend also look for events that need volunteers, music festivals, comic conventions, etc. Often events will have perks for volunteers if they work so many hours like free tickets to other concerts in festivals, or some drink tickets or something which is always fun.  I did a music festival a few weeks ago and my 'team' was a super fun group of ladies, so much so that we plan to get drinks together soon. I got to bounce around in the sunshine talking about music, meeting people and answering questions, all while getting to listen to some awesome live shows of a bunch new types of music I'd never really heard.

After a biopsy, my doctor concluded that my strain would have a 75% chance of turning into cervical cancer if the abnormal cells weren't removed, so we did a LEEP procedure to get rid of them. It sucked, but it seemed to work. I did quarterly pap smears for a year, and they all came back normal. Hooray.  My yearly one came up a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like it's abnormal yet again. They want to wait three months to see if it goes back to normal on its own, if not then I'll have to start the whole process over again.   Has anyone been through something like this? I don't necessarily think that they're trying to sell me on procedures that I don't need, but there's so much conflicting information out there about paps/HPV that I really don't know what to think anymore.

I wasn't allowed to use tampons, so I kept changing liners out every hour to try to keep the smell from being noticeable. It probably wasn't ever noticed by anyone else, but it made me incredibly self conscious that whole time."

From last Wednesday to this Wednesday, my vagina smelled like it was dying, and I guess my scabs are shedding or something, because when I wipe, it looks like my junk is covered in charcoal pebbles. Fortunately (ha), my period started on Wednesday, so at least I don't smell like my junk is rotting anymore. Now I just have to change my pads every two hours or so because, like you, I can't use tampons for four weeks, and I bleed like I got stabbed in the aorta when I'm on my period."

Find reasonably relevant volunteer opportunities to keep you busy in the meantime. If something completely random and cool pops up in the meantime, go for it! Sometimetimes the universe throws you a bone out of nowhere.   I have gone through those rough patches. Sometimes it takes months and months to get through it.

I graduated with a degree in high school math education and kept getting to the last round of interviews just for them to pick someone else. I interviewed with 7 schools before one picked me. The funny thing is that after I signed a contract, two other schools re-contacted me because of sudden vacancies. So keep talking to people and make sure they know you're interested if anything comes up in the future. You might interview dozens of times but you only need one job."

AskTrollX,3dorpi,pompeii1009,2,Sat Jul 18 00:41:45 2015 UTC,My SO and I try not to go more than 2 months apart. We skype sleep and I get to wake up to cute notes he leaves before he goes to work. We try to communicate a lot. His job requires him to talk all day and often he just wants to relax and not talk much after work. However I never get tired of talking and that can be frustrating when he doesn't want to talk. I try to keep in mind that if we were in person we wouldn't be in constant conversation and it's okay to skype while we watch netflix or something.
AskTrollX,3dorpi,datapplepie,2,Sat Jul 18 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"Leave each other sweet post-it notes (or other thoughtful surprises) whenever you visit one another. Ask him to leave a shirt behind to snuggle with. Order takeout for each other. Don't stress if you can't talk every single day. Have a show (on Netflix or a newer something) that you'll watch an episode of each week and then talk about afterwards (don't worry about doing it at ""the same time"" because this can get really weird and sometimes annoying with the time difference anyway).   Mostly just continue to love one another."

AskTrollX,3dorpi,head_zombie,5,Sat Jul 18 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"Always plan or at least schedule your next visit with each other.  Never leave it open ended so that you do not know when you will see each other.  It leaves you unsure if and or when you will see each other again. Talk daily if possible, most importAnt for checking in daily.  To see if their is any daily difficulties or challenges to talk about. Never hang up the phone angry.  I know it sounds simple but the phone is the only way to communicate,  respect it and hold it true. Lots of SoP, Sex over the phone.  It's hard at first because its part fantasy and part dirty talk.  The physical connection in a relationship releases stress and rejuvenates the body with hormones.    Love and cherish each other!"
AskTrollX,3dorpi,coffinnail_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"Skype was so key in my LD relationship. We skyped all the time - while making food, while doing homework, while playing videogames, watching a show... whatever... It was just the simple look up and see his cute face doing whatever he was doing. It really put me at ease.     Where in Canada are you? Is the time difference going to be a killer? West coast vs east coast will make a difference in how much time you can share awake.     Plan phone calls. I would always call after my morning class because he could align it with one of his breaks at work. Trying to match schedules mid-day for ten minutes is better than calling after work while he's asleep... so keep in mind time zones, schedules, and free time. Always try and make a bit of time for each other! Even a quick ""Hey I'm running off to meet so and so, can't talk today but still thinking of you"" text with a photo is great. With all the technology available, use it! We texted photos back and forth allllll the time of all the stupid little things like ""look at this cute dog I just got to pet"" or ""I'm too lazy to make dinner check out my pizza"" It helped both of us feel closer and more connected. I knew more about what was going on in his day than people I actually saw all day.     Also, what everyone else is saying is a necessity. Always know when you will visit next. Try to make the plans during or before your next meeting so you can already know when you are saying goodbye.     A big help for me was having some great girlfriends as well. Ones that weren't trying to get me to go meet new guys, or go out all the time. but instead were keen on wine nights in, or movie nights, or whatever..."

AskTrollX,3dm8zt,BlueRainstorm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry if this kind is not allowed here. I just really don't know what to post. If it really isn't allowed, can anyone tell me wherelese I can post? Throwaway as well since friends irl knows my main account.  I am a <20 college dropout who's being passed around from relative to relative because my real family is too poor to support me.  Currently I just want enough money to support myself, and when that's settled I would really like to get back to school. I've had a really hard time finding work since I'm underaged, very unqualified and the one time I did get a job, I had to quit since I was having too many panic attacks.  I'm pretty sure I have depression and anxiety, but I can't afford a psychiatrist so it's not official. I have several other physical conditions, including recurring pneumonia. I love telling people how sick I am, because I feel like I'm very justified in being a pathetic, hopeless loser. When I did get a job that was perfect for me, an online one wherein I get to make my own schedule so I don't have to be absent on the days I'm too sick, I gave myself the excuse that I'm too depressed to work over and over. Every day, I'd drag myself from my bed to the desk where my computer is and I feel like I don't belong in my body, and then just waste the whole day on the internet and pretend I'm not throwing my life away.  Sorry, I got a bit carried away there. Basically, my current situation is fucked. I need to come up with an amount of money or else I'm homeless and I'm going to lose my computer, which is my only hope right now.  It's not even a huge amount, but I really got nothing and every amount seems impossible right now. There's no such thing as shelters in this country, and as a woman I don't think I'll last a week in the streets. So as a last-ditch effort to come up with the money, I contacted a guy who has been trying to get into my pants for quite a while and who I've also been avoiding the hell out of because he makes me uncomortable. I contacted him because I knew he'd pay me for sexual favors. He would, and he doesn't even half  a fifth of the money I need but I agreed because it was something. If I have to sleep with a dozen other guys to come up with the money, I would, although I don't know how. That's my first question, I guess. I want to try and make arrangements through omegle or something, but I don't even know how to bring it up, much less how to get people to agree to such arrangements. Does anyone have any experience with these kind of things? I don't want to publicly advertise it, though. I want it to be a one time thing which I will hopefully learn enough from to get my shit together.  Another thing is: I'm scared. I'm a virgin. I don't have any experience, and I don't even know how to kiss. I'm meeting the guy next week and he asked for a nude pic in advanced and my blood just run cold. I don't care about the fact that my first time would be with someone who paid me. I don't even care if one of the guys turns out to be a murderer, that'll actually take care of all of these. I don't know why I'm scared, exactly. I just am. I tried to find another way out of this, I really did, but there's just nothing. It's either this or that jump of the building and I still really want to live, you know? How do I go through with this? If anyone has any other advice, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you, and help me TrollX, pleeeeaasssee."

AskTrollX,3dm8zt,kmm91,3,Fri Jul 17 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. The fact that you are in a pretty low emotional place doesn't mean you should ignore these feelings of apprehension. Once you sleep with this guy you are going to feel even worse and most likely will spiral.  There are other options that are more safe.

Somehow the friends I've made at my school lives on the other side of the country, and it's semestral break. I know they themselves don't really have a lot to spare.

You aren't in the right place emotionally or mentally to make this kind of choice. Not to mention, from a financial standpoint, your virginity is worth more than that. But, your mental health is worth the most and it is worth the world. I suggest posting to /r/personalfinance and giving them a condensed version of this story; tell them you require mental health assistance, as well as financial, and you don't have anyone to help you. Ask them what organizations, government or otherwise, in your area could help you back on your feet because you feel that without help, prostitution is the only answer. The personal finance sub reddit is usually very helpful (though, obviously brace for a couple less than nice replies) and I'm sure they'd know who or what could help you.  Please, please keep us updated and please be good to yourself. We believe in you and know that with a little help you can get yourself out of this hole."

And that kind of behavior on his part can definitely be a turn-off, for sure. It's also a bit of a yellow flag; if everything else was totally fine and dandy then it wouldn't be an issue, but sounds like it's not. He might feel you pulling away and thinks it's due to some other guy in your life, when it's really just a loss of connection with him. But his reaction shows more possessiveness than a desire for a true connection with you. Or he may just be super controlling and it's starting to emerge."

He's pretty stuck in his ways and probably won't change and I'm 25 and still in the process of figuring out who I am. I really do care about him and we have fun, but there are some things that I just can't get past. A lot if this has to do with him being out of work for 5 months while I was working non stop. For 5 months I would get days off of work and he would always be there. I never got time to myself. It was fine in the first 2 or 3 months, but after a while, he started to grind on my nerves because I never got alone time. Even when he would go in the other room and leave me alone, it didn't make a difference. I knew he was doing it because of me. And it still didn't matter. Someone else was still in the house and I couldn't fully relax because they could walk in the room at any minute and disturb any peace I was getting.   He's starting a job on monday, which is great, but I'm wondering if him being at work while I'm finally getting the place to myself is going to make any difference..."

AskTrollX,3dkh8m,newheart_restart,4,Fri Jul 17 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'm 20, he's 24. (Also, any thoughts on that age gap? Never dealt with that either)  Context: We only met a week and a half ago, so it's a bit of a whirlwind, but we really click and I think we could really go well together. He has a complicated family past, but in short his dad had an affair, resulting in a divorce. Around the same time, his brother contracted head lice, which spurred the onset of delusional parasitosis in his mom, where you have delusions that there is some kind of parasitic infestation on your person/in your house. They've been dealing with this for maybe ten years now. He had moved out after high school but moved back in to take care of her when she got sick.  I met his mom for the first time yesterday by pure happenstance, and he said she likes me, but I'm still really nervous. Apparently she tries to sabotage all his relationships, and I caught her in a lucky good mood. I've never had to deal with this kind of thing in the past, and I just don't know how to balance being supportive of him and trying to appease her. I guess she tries to convince his girlfriends they're too good for him and disparages him in front of them.  Any tips?"
AskTrollX,3dkh8m,BitchesMakePuppies,9,Fri Jul 17 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I would hit the eject button.  He's told you that she sabotages his relationships. All of them. He either is too naive to realize that his mother will never change and he needs to keep his distance, or just doesn't care enough about the women he's dated to keep them away from her. And is sabotaging your family's romantic relationships a symptom of her disease, or does she not want to share her son?  Again, I'm not trying to pass judgement. And I could be totally off base. Mental illness is hard, and having a parent who is struggling with something for so long is impossible, but he's showing you who he is, who his mother is, and how things have gone in the past. Is working around and dealing with his mother's mental illness worth it? Because it could and almost certainly will be all consuming: mentally, emotionally, etc. And if you stay with this man, you will have to navigate this for a very very long time. Decide if it's worth it."
AskTrollX,3dkh8m,marleeana,2,Fri Jul 17 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. While it is hard to hear, I do need to consider that this may be a dealbreaker. We haven't been hanging out long but thus far it seems manageable. He has a very good head on his shoulders and can tell between legitimate problems with his mom and her giving him shit for untrue reasons.  It also helps that she really likes me, as she told him after we met. So hopefully that will help not put extra strain. I guess that's not common with his exes."
AskTrollX,3dkh8m,marleeana,7,Fri Jul 17 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"Patience and communication. I would make sure you have a talk with him about your very concerns that you're bringing up here. Say, ""I know it's still early on, but I really feel like we click well, and I know you've brought up a lot about your past and family. I want to work through anything that might come up with your mom but I need to know that we're working as a team. I want to make sure you know I'm feeling a bit nervous because I (thankfully) haven't had to deal with these problems before, and I also want you to know that I'm here for you and want to support you any way I can, but I'll need you to be patient if I don't know what to do. Help me to help you. Your mom seemed like a nice lady, and I hope I can continue to get along with her. I understand mental illness is super tough to deal with, and I also know that I have never had to deal with it so closely before. Help me learn how to deal with your mom if she starts acting up around me. Let me know that you'll understand if I mess up because I'm new to all of this. I like you a lot and want to make sure we can keep up open communication, since that's the only way we can both be comfortable in a tough situation.""  Basically, remind him why you're talking to him, and make him feel cared about. Make sure he knows that you're concerned because you like him, and make sure that open lines of communication are opened right off the bat.  Remember he's had to deal with his mother a lot more closely than you ever will, so he should be able to help guide you in doing so if he wants this to work out too.  You've got this :)"
AskTrollX,3dkh8m,Stemcellebration,2,Fri Jul 17 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"Very good advice :) I've expressed my concern somewhat, but I am also trying to feel out their (his and his mom's) relationship before I make any assumptions or start giving input. He says she really likes me, and I haven't seen first hand her being overly invasive, so I have a good feeling. But I'll definitely keep communication open.   One question to add: For instance, his mom told me to get him to apply for a new job. He works at a startup which is very disorganized at the moment and his paycheck is late. I don't really know how to navigate it when she says things like that in front of me. Obviously he likes his job, despite his frustrations. Do I stand up to her and say he can make his own decisions, he loves his job, etc or do I appease her, say ok I'll try, or try and say nothing as much as possible? I should probably just ask him about it but I dunno."
AskTrollX,3dkh8m,happiersadist,2,Fri Jul 17 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"I think personally in that situation (going off of what you've said here at least) I would bring it up to him and just let him know that you don't want him to feel like you're going behind his back and plotting with his mom, and you're just kind of uncomfortable with her asking you to do something like that and want to make sure he's aware of the situation. Perhaps (if you would be comfortable with it) ask him if he thinks it would be good for you to try to talk with her about how you don't feel comfortable being asked to do stuff like that, and see what he thinks of that. Again, he knows her best so he should have the best idea of how you should react. (And even if he's wrong, your relationship with him is more important than your relationship with his mom, so keeping up that open communication with him should come first- you're a little confused about what to do, so you should be able to talk to him about it)"
AskTrollX,3djlp5,DEUXyeux,9,Thu Jul 16 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are taking care of yourself. Do things that make you happy, healthy, and able to cope.  If you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to help him.  These are super similar to the self-care worksheets that they gave me when I started crisis counseling.  If those don't work for you, this one is kind of nice and this one, too.  It can feel really cheesy, but is super useful and important.  I might suggest seeing if your boyfriend would also be interested in adapting one or more of those into a relationship-care strategy.  Like, maybe ritualize some together time (once a week we drink a beer together on the porch/take a walk, or every morning we talk about our hopes for the day, or every other saturday we go on a date)."

I really want to fit/blend in, but I don't want to wear something too upscale, since he and I will be hanging out after the opening is over, possibly with other people (not sure). I also have no idea what we will be doing. Some ideas that he had were going to a bar, going to watch a movie, playing in the studio, or climbing trees.

As long as it's not sweatpants and dirty t-shirts (hell I've seen people wear that) you're going to be fine! Don't worry! Just dress nicely, like you're going out to dinner maybe? Or ""Sunday best""?

Maybe a dress if you're a dress person, but seriously these things are relatively casual events.  FWIW I've been to a lot of art openings, and I would say it's unheard of for people to wear formalwear. At best you'll get a few people who are trying way too hard who came in cocktail attire. I've seen people in costume/wacky outfits, but it's usually That One Guy, not a thing people actually do.  Honestly, anything cute/put-together that isn't sweatpants and crocs is going to be fine."

Do you arrive on time and stay the whole time, or is it okay to be a little late? Can you leave early, or is that kind of a no-no (I won't have time to eat beforehand most likely)? What do you do if you go by yourself (since my friend is the artist, I doubt I'll spend much time with him at all during the event)?"
AskTrollX,3dita7,TantalizingTroupial,3,Thu Jul 16 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"I've been to some and had some openings too. Usually it's ok to come/go as you please, though there's often a little presentation type thing in the beginning. Usually if you go by yourself, you go and look at the art. There will often be small appetizers too, so eating's an option."
AskTrollX,3dita7,big_catalpa,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"Hm. Most of the openings I've been to, I needed to be there the whole time because I was directly involved in organizing the opening, curating the show, had my own work in it, etc. As a guest, my take is that the time of the opening is a window during which you can stop by at any time. It's more like a party, less like a theatre performance, if that makes sense. Since you and your friend have plans afterwards, it makes sense to time your appearance to stay till the end. And fashionably late is always good, anyway. I'd say that if you won't know anyone else there and are struggling to find a window to have dinner, eat beforehand, plan to show up sometime around the midpoint of the opening, and stay till the end.   Keep in mind that you can usually entertain yourself by looking at the art, having a glass of wine and/or a snack, checking out the space, potentially making small talk if you are into that sort of thing, etc. It's kind of like going to a party where you might not know anyone, but hey, at least there's stuff to do.   A lot of people with little or no relationship to the show or the artist(s) will just drop in to make an appearance. So you can also do that. Though, again, since you guys have plans after it makes sense to time your drive-by for the end of the opening."

AskTrollX,3djt8t,CWertman,5,Thu Jul 16 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"I think I have a better bearing on your situation now, but just to make sure I'm in the right head-space, this is what I understand from what you've said so far:  You guys are casual and don't have a specific label, but you'd like to know what his opinion is on the situation. Is it just casual, FWB, does he think you're dating, and so on.  I guess the first thing to figure out is what you want. Do you want to be FWB, or more, with him and if so, what does that label to you? Are you guys having sex because it's something fun that you both like to do with each other and you want to continue to explore and grow the situation that you have?  The next part is the more difficult, navigating the waters of his feelings and intentions. What does he want, is this situation just an opportunity for sex and nothing more? Maybe he wants to upgrade it to a FWB, but the first part of that acronym is ""friend"" and I'm not getting that from what you've said so far.  It sucks, but the only way to know is to ask him directly. I'd suggest coffee or something because if you ask before sex, he might just say whatever he thinks you want to hear in order to get to the sex, and if you ask after, he might avoid the question.  The other thing to consider is are you ready for his response. Let's take the probable worst case scenario, are you ready to hear that he thinks of you as just a booty call? If you can handle hearing that, then anything else he might say would likely be an improvement."
AskTrollX,3djt8t,sarasmirks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"foreplay is ""actual sex"".  PIV sex can be weird, especially with a new partner or if you're not very experienced at it.  The real question is, do you like this guy? Like LIKE him? Do you want to keep having sex with him? It's totally valid if you just want to keep him around for oral sex purposes, btw.   If you aren't into him, though, just end it. Lots of dudes are good at sex. You should be with someone who makes you feel more than ""meh."""

I've also gradually started spotting around ovulation, and then it pretty much extends into the next time I get my period... Have you experienced anything like this?

Now if I'm switching, I ask my boyfriend to keep an eye out for new behavior or attitudes, and that's been helping me figure out if it's affecting me (and how seriously).   I guess the short answer is, I don't know exactly when the effects kicked in for me. It just kind of happened.

It may not work for you - but I definitely had to try a few before I found one I liked and for some reason a lot of women don't realize it might help to try a few out. I was on the pill for 7 years and had a great experience once I found the right one. Now I've switched to Mirena (IUD) and it's awesome as well if you are looking for less hormones (they're local rather than systemic so it doesn't give me mood swings, plus no periods)."

What you're describing sounds a lot like depression to me and you don't have to live with that. I tried about 5 different pills and nuva ring before ending up with an IUD. I was pretty much suicidal on nuva ring while 2 of the 5 pills made me feel really depressed. You don't have to stop completely, not all pills will affect you the same way but it's totally up to what you feel comfortable with.  Also, there are non-hormonal forms of birth control that may not affect your mood at all."

I tried for years in college, and would usually see disruptive emotional effects 1-3 months in. One pill completely obliterated my sex drive (defeats the purpose!), one made me feel no emotions (healthy!) and another gave me weird anger issues (cool!). I also had other pills with crappy physical effects like constant spotting. I just straight up gave up with oral bc for a few years because it was so frustrating, and I'm trying again with a new formulation. My partner has been through this with me before, so he's on the lookout for any unusual behaviors. I figure if I get weird, I'll give it 2 months tops to sort itself out."

I had to go to a bio-identical hormone doc to get the prescription, as they focus on optimizing hormone levels. Most docs will say ""your hormones are normal,"" while a bio identical hormone doc will say ""let's get your hormones to the optimal level for you, while keeping them within normal levels.""   My doc is part of http://physioage.com which has a couple offices around the country.

AskTrollX,3d8pmk,omfgjanne,14,Tue Jul 14 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why this is a thing, but it happened to me a lot when I was dating. These motherfuckers were in their late 20s-early 30s, so it's not just something you could write off as the behavior of the young and immature.   I spent a lot of time and emotional energy agonizing over what I was doing, what was wrong with me, and how I could get guys to stop disappearing on me before I realized that this is just shitty behavior that's going around. I talked to my friends, I talked to other single ladies I met here and there, same story. Sure, examining your own behavior is a good step like other people are suggesting, but sometimes your experiences are part of a bigger picture.  As for dealing with it, know your self worth, be confident, and have a low tolerance for bullshit, because having this happen to you repeatedly is crazy making and it wears down your standards for acceptable behavior. Also, sooner or later one of these guys will resurface like nothing ever happened wanting to come over and nooooope."

I don't want to sound conceited, but I'm very kind to my boyfriends. I make them food, I don't demand expensive dates, etc. And I had that happen constantly, and I remember thinking that I must have some awful problem because I'm the common denominator in all of the ghostings.   As soon as I reasoned with myself that I was not the problem and that they were just being cowardly about their intentions and plans, I was able to become more confident once I realized that I wasn't some damaged piece of trash to pass around from one wimp to the next. Did wonders for my dating life."

AskTrollX,3d8pmk,Sadpoppy,12,Tue Jul 14 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"Basically, the fade away.

AskTrollX,3d8pmk,shutupkait,8,Tue Jul 14 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly it could be anything, age, type of guys, how you relate with them, etc. I went through a long period where I dated guys and they would randomly stop talking to me, one of them finally admitted that the only reason he talked to me in the first place was because he wanted to hook up and nothing more, where as I was looking for something more. It could be the age thing, I mean I was in my early to mid 20's when this was going on and a lot of it was because the guys didn't want to settle down.   I also have been a little weird or overly excited which has scared guys away as well. My advice is look at the situations as if it were your friend and if you think something ""your friend"" did was weird or clingy maybe that's it or maybe the guy ""your friend""  was seeing really didn't seem all that interested. It sounds weird but when you remove yourself from a situation sometimes you can see things a little clearer."
AskTrollX,3d8pmk,Lanilegend,3,Tue Jul 14 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"I've had guys in their 30s try to pull this and late 20s. So, it's not always age.   Your last point rings true for me. If a guy is super interested in you, you can act excited to see him, be silly and weird, etc. If he's kind of just playing along to get laid, doesn't care about you that much, and doesn't want a long term thing with you though, he'll play along until he gets what he wants and then he'll disappear.  It's really difficult, because people play games with each other. You don't know what they think of you, so you think the right way to act is simply to be yourself and try to act how you want to. And, honestly, even if they end up ghosting you I would say that's the right approach anyway. Now you know he didn't really like you that much. Who wants to date someone who's not as enamoured of them as they are of the other person?   I spent a lot of time thinking about this shit a while ago when I was still dating before finding my wonderful boyfriend, and there's always a line that comes back to me. As shitty as it is, I think it might be true, unfortunately.  Whoever cares more has the least amount of power in the relationship.  That's an awful thing to consider. By not giving a shit, you have power over the person who does. Or if you care a lot, they are holding the strings in the relationship. You have to try and establish some sort grounds where a game is not being played, and that's really hard to do. You don't want to not care, but sometimes it's the only thing that saves you. I recently read a quote by Anais Nin that really gets me, and if I had to ever date again, I would definitely keep this as my mantra simply to protect myself, my dignity, and my emotional well-being:  “I am only responsible for my own heart, you offered yours up for the smashing my darling. Only a fool would give out such a vital organ”  ― Anaïs Nin"

For the most part, it's no big deal. We went out a couple of times, nothing much happened. But the guy I've been seeing for two months appears to be doing the same thing, now. He was super dooper into me at first (seeing each other three times a week, texting daily, talking on the phone), then he cooled off. Then he was into it again. Now he's cooled off again. I feel like I'm in a Katy Perry song. I haven't contacted him in a week, and I'm starting to get over the hurt feeling, and am now dealing with the confusion."

I don't know if they get ""emotionally horny"", but I've gotten some use (for lack of better term, that just sounds assholish) out of getting emotional intimacy from someone I didn't particularly see myself with seriously (although they thought the opposite). It was a douche thing of me to do, but when you have someone in which It takes no effort...you just choose them because your lazy and complacent. I eventually put a stop to the whole thing.

I said fuck it and deleted him! Now about a year or so ago (a year or two after he poofed) as I'm planning to travel 1000 miles and get married he facebook messages me apologizing!

AskTrollX,3d8pmk,Cantkillabullmoose,8,Tue Jul 14 22:05:11 2015 UTC,"After suffering from a bunch of girls ghosting on me (and I mean possibly up to 30-40 people over the past few years), I've talked to a bunch of guys and girls about this, and found some random blog posts on it, too.   There was a poll done (I wish I could find it) in the past year or so and the results were very interesting.  It seems that in the 20s-30s age group, for whatever reason, a very large minority of individuals think it's perfectly acceptable, normal, and even ""better"" to just ghost on people. They see it as more convenient and actually an obvious signal.   I'm guessing the core influencers in that minority group are going to be the entitled, uber-socialite kids, and the rest of them are the people who emulate them, and/or haven't grown out of it. There are probably another 1-2% who actually just have a personality disorder and make up excuses to sound ""normal.""  I've met lots of people who are into the casual thing who were also perfectly communicative, and met others who wanted something more serious who would just as quickly ghost as someone explicitly into NSA. So I don't think it's necessarily about what they want out of the date/connection/relationship.   In conclusion, it seems to be a rift along subcultural, value-system, and personality differences. Which is probably why it's so unpredictable and thus so frustrating."

When I was in my teens, 20s and 30s this happened all the time to people; you all just have a new word for it. Just look at romcom type movies from decades past and there is always someone upset about being ignored, not having their calls returned, etc.   It probably seems more prolific because there are significantly more ways to communicate with people and thus significantly more places to be ignored - email, text, comments on posts (FB,instagram, snapchat,etc) and more.   When I was younger there were two ways ignore/be ignored - in person or the telephone."

I think a lot of people (both girls and guys) figure it's easier to just not respond then to go to the trouble of saying something to end things, and online dating makes ""just not responding"" amazingly easy.  I have a friend that's always complaining about this.  Me, I got lucky first time out and scored a great SO.  I didn't realize how rare that apparently is.  Maybe the best way to deal with it is to take everything as a good thing in and of itself, for what it is, without any expectation.  Have a chat with someone online?  Cool!  If it leads to a date, then you have a fun night out with someone.  Cool!  If that leads to more dates, cool!  If that leads to sex/romance, cool!  But if it stops at any point, it was still fun up to that point.  Just try to let go of expectations and enjoy the now.  Maybe."

The most recent guy I was talking to was a bit older and seemed really interested- up until he started barely replying to my texts. At first it seemed like he was just busy; I knew he'd gotten a new job and was dealing with some personal stuff so I didn't think too much of it until he stopped replying altogether (then texted me after a week of ignoring me then started ignoring me again).   I wish I had an answer for you. I wish I had an answer for myself. I feel like there is obviously something wrong with me that I'm just not getting. I mean, once is a coincidence, twice is a shame, and three (plus!) times it's obviously something wrong with me. I am never one to go to the level of 'hurr durr all men are assholes' but they aren't making much of a case for themselves here. Why is it so hard for a guy to just say he's not interested?

AskTrollX,3d8pmk,bandaidtanlines,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"It all depends, it could be them and their flaky behavior where they aren't ready for something, or feel that you aren't compatible. Also may depend on the age range that you're dating as well.  But you may want to look at your own behavior and see if there is anything you do that contributes to it. I hate to say it, but sometimes we need to self assess and figure out why we're the common denominator in a situation and work to improve it. It sucks to do, but it leads to personal growth and healthier relationships in the future."
AskTrollX,3d8pmk,shantivirus,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"""Ghosting"" has become super common recently.   My suspicion is that it has a lot to do with the spread of smartphones over the last 5-6 years having a very real effect on basic social interaction. Texting has been around for a long time, but back when I was in school it was only kinda common. Now it's everywhere. Social media has become more integral, too. Because we're adapting to these new social mediums, different trends tend to come and go. Ghosting, I think, is a confluence of a few things (old person rant incoming...):   1) Being permanently and always attached to data networks and instant communication and cyber-stalking can be a nightmare. I can't speak for anyone else, but there are times I hate the Facebook Messenger sound or the Messages sound on my phone or my computer. Because of that, there can be this lower amount of patience.   2) Social media is part mask and part egomania. I've seen it everywhere: if you're out or in, doing something or not, the phone is out and the screen is casting a faint glow on the face. People use it to hide, to get out of social interaction, to act like they're more interesting than everyone around them, to communicate they're bored, to take endless pictures of themselves and their food to send to other people. On the one hand, this means you can use this always-on communication as a way to hide from people. On the other hand, you are given this sense of ridiculous self-importance. That's not the best combination.   3) Some guys are cowards. This is the creamy nougat at the center of ghosting. Beneath everything else is fear, fear of rejection, fear of being found out as uninteresting, fear of not being seen as cool, etc. If these guys had any fortitude, they'd actually communicate their feelings like adults. Instead, they just exist as a little green light on Messenger, like Daisy's green light from The Great Gatsby. Maybe you are saying something or doing something that these guys don't like, but if they're not man enough to tell you, you need to be woman enough to say fuck em and find a real man.   Now, you youngens with your newfangled contraptions need to get off my lawn."

I reject most guys who try to talk to me simply because they seem like the type to want to play the field, or just sleep with whatever cute girl they can find, and I'd rather not find out the hard way. Ask yourself if you think you're their type. That's what I do. For example, I get hit on by bros  from time to time.

There's no deep-rooted, tormented personality hidden underneath a mask of coldness -- he seems to be actually that simple. And he dates women like you or I would try out different foods: takes a little nibble, says ""eh, it's not my thing,"" moves on.   I think my point is, as women we should probably stop wasting energy overthinking these things. 'Cause the faders certainly aren't losing any sleep over it."
AskTrollX,3d8pmk,dominosci,2,Wed Jul 15 02:33:49 2015 UTC,"How long has he been seeing these women for, though?   I couldn't care less if it's one or two dates, shit happens. But after a couple of months, it makes it really confusing.  I'm sure I've ghosted guys in the past (if we were talking online or texting), but if it's someone I've gone out with and they ask me out again I at least tell them I didn't feel the spark."
AskTrollX,3d8pmk,ladylurkedalot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"It's usually only a few weeks, but he gets really intense, texts them back-and-forth all day, brings them little gifts, invites them to meet his friends. Usually loses interest and poofs before they get physical, which is even more confusing.   He seems to be very wrapped up in himself and his interests, and concerned that sharing too much time with another person will deprive him of his fun. The more I think about it, that's probably what it is. Classic man-boy commitment-phobic.  I just figure, if a certain percentage of men are like him, then I shouldn't waste my time worrying about them."

It's M/M and can be pretty dark(slavery, abuse, death and such) but it's a different take on the slave trope. Usually they can be all whiny and ""I'll rescue you, my slave, my love!!"" but not this one. There's action, sex, political intrigue, and SO MUCH SEXUAL TENSION YUSS.   Captive Prince by C.S. Pacat   Damen is a warrior hero to his people, and the rightful heir to the throne of Akielos. But when his half brother seizes power, Damen is captured, stripped of his identity, and sent to serve the prince of an enemy nation as a pleasure slave.  Beautiful, manipulative, and deadly, his new master, Prince Laurent, epitomizes the worst of the court at Vere. But in the lethal political web of the Veretian court, nothing is as it seems, and when Damen finds himself caught up in a play for the throne, he must work together with Laurent to survive and save his country.  For Damen, there is just one rule: never, ever reveal his true identity. Because the one man Damen needs is the one man who has more reason to hate him than anyone else…   I also enjoyed this one too: The Archer's Heart"

Another note Starbucks makes you answer these weird questions, and I was honest, you apparently can't wear rings with gemstones, well I'm married and both my rings have gemstones so I couldn't even apply to work there because I'd rather keep my rings on then off. Oddly enough I'm aloud to wear my rings where I work now, it's slightly dangerous and would make sense for me to not be aloud to wear my rings but I 100% can.

Speaking from very personal experience, film crews are pretty laid back, as are most media offices in production, animation/post-production, advertising and design (at least in NY). BUUUUT it's hard enough to land a position in this industry that saying that doesn't really matter. You might find more luck at non-chain stores.

If we can't see them we call, we text, we skype, so that they know that we still care and want them.   It's when we don't care that we begin to ignore, not respond and not put effort in. It shows the lack of investment in something when you don't put any sort of effort into the other person.

AskTrollX,3d7c2l,squeakyrobot,2,Tue Jul 14 06:33:05 2015 UTC,"So, we met on OkCupid and had a 5 hour long, exceptionally awesome first date. Text every day, from the time we wake up until we go to bed. So much in common and we decide to meet up again. Second date, we meet up for drinks and he asks me to be his girlfriend. I said yes cause fuck ""rules"";when you feel it, you feel it. Ever since then, it's been the strangest thing.  Sporadic texting, days where I'm completely ignored, etc. I have seen him once in 2 weeks. He had a hard week last week with work and we made it work on Saturday, but he just seemed to be elsewhere mentally. He never calls me and says he doesn't like talking on the phone. I want to give him a chance, with the possibility is that he is so drained and busy. At the same time, this is not what I wanted.  I had so many other dates I turned away because I felt such a connection. I had never been so excited after a date in my life. Never has someone been as nerdy and smart as me, with so many similar interests. To have this happen is leaving me without knowing how to approach it. I know I need to talk to him, but I don't know what to say or how or what setting. I also don't know if I text him that we need to talk if he will even answer. Should I try to work it out or just end it? What say you, trolls?  TL;DR: New relationship has some weird issues early on. What do?"
AskTrollX,3d7c2l,squeakyrobot,3,Tue Jul 14 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'd try to work it out - but by that, I mean, give it like a week or two.  Text and tell him you need to see him, that it's important.  (If he doesn't respond, or can't set a date within a week or two, end it.)  If he does find the time to see you, tell him how you're feeling.  I'd say something like, ""I really like you.  I don't know what's going on in your life right now - if you're just really busy with work or whatever - but how this relationship is going isn't working out for me.  I need to be able to spend more time with you and feel like you're here with me.  I know you felt a connection too, but if you don't have the energy for a relationship right now, I need to know that.""  (And at that point, if he wants to make it work, give it a couple weeks and see how it's going.)  Sometimes people get busy or stressed and aren't totally present in their relationship.  And I think that's okay.  But at the very beginning, when everything's new?  I don't think that's okay.  If you had been together for a year (or even a couple months!) I might say to give it a little more time, if he was communicating and telling you why he was distant/distracted.  Basically, it's not okay for one person to make an effort.  Even if you both really like each other, even if he's super stressed with work, he still needs to make an effort to see you - or at the very least, talk to you, if you don't live near each other."

The post-Disassembled Avengers, after they cut out a good bit of decades of deadwood and made a new team, were pretty good too.  But I stopped collecting for a while, around the Siege of Asgard event, and now the stories have gone on without me, and I can't catch up.    It's like missing a couple months of a soap opera or professional wrestling (but I repeat myself), and you lose track of what's going on and wonder who all these new characters are.  By the way, if you really like comics, don't forget to sign up for the redditgifts comics & graphic novels exchange before it signup closes today.  And check out the HumbleBundle books deals.  They've been on a programming and electronics how-to for kids bit lately, but I'd say a good half of their deals are for comic books."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,Sheerardio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"If you think missing a few months of issues is bad, I'm currently attempting to map all of the X-Men and derivative titles in suggested reading order for a class on visualizing information.  I'm going crosseyed trying to get through the 80's alone."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,kandoras,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"Uggh.  X-Cutioners Song and Muir Island Saga, how I loved thee.  But how damnable hard was it to read you in order when I last looked you up on Marvel Unlimited.  You'd think they'd have put links in on all the crossovers ""Click here for the next issue in this series, which is eight issues further down the story or click here for the next issue which is in a series you've never even heard of.""  And just mapping the X-Men titles alone still wouldn't do the job.  Some of the crossovers, like Onslaught, mixed over with the Avengers and Fantastic Four."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,Sheerardio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm limiting my data set to only X-Men titles and leaving out crossover issues, because I have to actually turn in a finished product at some point.  As it is I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how to show concurrently running titles in a way that makes sense.  I did at least find a super handy site that lists all titles (including crossovers and special appearances) in a suggested, rather than chronological, reading order, so that saved me a ton of time!"
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,kandoras,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, they've even got the First Class issues in there, and they came out forty years after the originals.  You'd think Marvel would have tackled this project already for their entire catalog.  Sure, interns would have been going insane by the score, ordering and reordering issues until cover prices and series numbers floated through their dreams - but it's not like Marvel would be paying them for it."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,Sheerardio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Right? XD  We had to choose our own topic for this project and it had to be something with a large data pool and multiple variables.  Some people did family trees, some did evolutionary charts... I figured comic book fans are obsessive enough that they'd have already done most of the work for me.  Definitely was not wrong.  Still, an official reader's guide would just make sense at this point."

When i see the stuff about Ms or Capitan Marvel, I get stuck on the thought that Rogue killed/absorbed her in the 80's as that was how Rogue got the power to fly... that I have trouble even knowing where to begin. Like kandoras said it is like trying to catch up on a soap you missed for years."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,kandoras,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"My wife and I just got Marvel Unlimited, and I really enjoyed Captain Marvel, but a lot of the other stuff I've read fails so hard. (For example, The first thing we learn about the first named female character in X-23 is that she was sexually assaulted by her father).  What other Marvel titles respect their female characters instead of abusing them so much that it becomes distracting?"
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,totallyarogue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"When I read them, Ms. Marvel was a great one.  It (at the time) had bits in it about how she was trying to hold down a relationship and an income in addition to the general ""beat up the space monster"" fare.  Although the thigh-high boots costume was a little unnecessary I though."
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,totallyarogue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"So! I'm a woman who actually co-hosts a podcast that's about inclusivity in comics, with a major focus on Marvel titles (because we're all big Marvel nerds and haven't been super impressed with DC's attempts of late).   My recommendations:  Runaways  The original 2 runs, from 2003 to like, 2008? Written by Brain K. Vaughn, who now writes the current juggernaut and darling of creator own comics, Saga. Runaways is about a bunch of teenagers who discover their parents are the bad guys. An older series but a great run. Deals with being a teenager excellently and stars more female characters than male, including a lesbian alien and a genderfluid skrull (in the 2nd volume).  Kieron Gillen's run on Journey into Mystery  Young Avengers (vol 2)  Loki: Agent of Asgard  I'm hella biased because I've loved Loki's adventures since he was reborn post-Siege of Asgard as Kid Loki. If you want some amazing reading, check out Matt Fraction's Thor run, which led into Kieron Gillen's run on Journey into Mystery, which THEN led into Gillen's Young Avengers, which THEN ran into Loki: AoA, written by the lovable Al Ewing. It's a hella lot of reading but it's one of the most wonderful character arcs I've ever seen develop in comics.   Gillen and Ewing took Loki from a somewhat stereotypical cackling villain to an interesting character dealing with godhood and the nature of mythology. Bonus points that Ewing's run embraces Loki's gender fluidity and both runs have superb supporting female characters (Leah of Hel, Verity Willis, the women of the Young Avengers, who thankfully show up in other titles such as A-Force and Hawkeye).  Side note: While it's a non-Marvel title, Gillen's creator-own property, The Wicked + The Divine, is breathtaking and one of the most diverse comics that's ever been created.  She-Hulk  The most recent run of She-Hulk was written by Charles Soule and it is the best BEST best version of Shulkie, ever. It's basically a law procedural with superheroes. She-Hulk is in a book where she's FINALLY not sexualized; she is powerful and brilliant and backed up by awesome female characters like Hellcat and her very eccentric para-legal, Angie. The art on this title has turned some people off, but I adore the crazy mod style and the brilliant use of paneling for storytelling.  Angela: Asgard's Assassin  Co-written by Kieron Gillen, soon to be wholly written by a woman, Marguerite Bennett (co-writer of A-Force!). This title reclaims Angela from the Spawn sex-symbol she rotted as for a long time and brings her back to rights as a character created by Neil Gaiman. Bonus points for Angela's sidekick, Sera, who's an angelic bard and also trans.  Ms. Marvel   Like almost everyone else has said, this title is incredible. Kamala Khan is the modern day Peter Parker: she deals with heroics mixed with very familiar issues of being a teenager, a girl, and also Muslim. This series is one of the best ongoing titles right now and I could not possibly recommend it highly enough.  A-Force  Co-written by G. Willow Wilson, who writes Ms. Marvel, A-Force is a book that ties into the current ongoing Marvel super event, Secret Wars. The event aside, this title is an Avengers team that is ALL FEMALE HEROES. Led by She-Hulk, but filled with pretty much every rad female hero active right now. Super fun.  I have a TON of other recommendations for modern Marvel, older Marvel and creator owned (Lumberjanes, Saga, Shutter, Bitch Planet!!!!) but it's waaay too easy to get overwhelmed when you're getting into or getting BACK into comics. Hopefully this is helpful and I hope you check back in with what titles you enjoy!"
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,Lots42,2,Tue Jul 14 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"Wow! This is an awesome list! Thanks for taking the time to write it up. I've heard really good things about shehulk, so I might start there. I'll try to remember to update the post, and I'll give your podcast a listen tomorrow at work (I'm a total podcast junkie when I code). Thanks again! :)"
AskTrollX,3d4w9j,BlueFeet9000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"No problem!   She-Hulk's a really great jumping in point because it's not heavily dependant on knowing a ton of Marvel continuity. Plus, it's just rad all around.  I do the podcast because I adore comics and I'm always thrilled to see people getting into them - this is really the best time to read comics in the medium's history, in my opinion.

My boss (who is a big man and is old enough to be my grandfather), keeps making sexual comments such as:  When asking how I injured myself, making the comment 'next time you should let him be on top'  and when he broke his wrist, making the comment that ' he has missed me and broke his wrist while thinking about me too much'  He also leers at my chest when talking to me, stands rather close and rubbed my back the other day across my bra strap (which while may not be sexual was unwarranted for and I felt uncomfortable).   When he says these things I want to tell him to stop but I keep freezing up, he has also said the first comment in front of a co-worker but they said nothing.  I shook my head at the wrist comment to show I wasn't happy but I seem to not be able to speak back..."

Ugh.    Ok, assuming you're not in the neighborhood:  If  you're just looking to have this dickhole stop harassing you so you can finish your time there with some GD dignity: I'd schedule a meeting with him & bring a 3rd person if you can.  Tell him basically to knock it right the fuck off. Tell him you have been documenting his unwanted advances & that if he continues to create a hostile work environment, you will be taking further action.   Write it down in advance, read it right off the paper if that's the best way to make sure it gets said (& I'd say put in writing via email or even certified mail after the meeting, but I'm a bit...thorough). Abusers like this fuck know that the normal human reaction to something so profoundly gross is to freeze up, that's not on you.   And unless he's 110, he fucking knows better.  Some older men when I was 20 might have actually honestly been confused about ""why can't I tell my assistant how hot her ass is?"" for a hot sec, but this shitbird is perfectly aware what he is doing is wrong.  Letting him know that you also know it's wrong & will not be tolerating it should scare the shit out of him.   Beginning right now, document everything. Every comment, every unwelcome touch. I know you're leaving soon but you just never know & documentation never hurts anything.  Seriously, document.   I'm not a lawyer, or someone who has worked in a lab, so there is likely someone who can give you advice re the EEOC (equal opportunity employment commission), title IX (in case it's a school lab), & the like.  But if what you want is for this person to stop being a degenerate poo pile, I'd say professionally delivered shock & awe will work.

It's no excuse whatsoever, but a lot of old people either don't bother to keep up with what's now considered inappropriate or just don't give a fuck.  He says something about masturbating to you?  ""Huh, figured you were way too old for that""  Mentions your sex life?  ""Oh wow really desperate for details?""  He has no innate shame so make him feel some.  However I would personally draw the line at touching.  Just a simple ""I'd rather you didn't touch me,"" should convey the message.  Sure, starting a battle over sexual harassment would be the noble course of action, but sometimes it's easier just to leave the fighting to someone else."

Then you lock your shit down, do not engage in drama and focus on your job. Tell your supervisor, in writings, about ALL of the incidents, that you asked this coworker to be respectful and that any future incidents need to be dealt with by your supervisor.

What is the best way to communicate my feelings on this to him?

I'll say I am not from a big city at all, but it is still a city. Don't really want to disclose. I decided to go early because the more chill crowds go to this place then... so I went around 7:30/8:00pm.  So I went to a bar and just kind of sat there, and read some stuff on Reddit. Mainly /r/worldnews because I figured why not. Had my drink and cigarette in hand, kind of wanted to immerse myself in a wall of text.  This dude I saw the night before with his dog was there (they have a really nice outside area to smoke and hang out and everything). I asked him what his dog's name was. It just went from there. We had a really great discussion and I think he is really interesting/attractive/things/yay.  Eventually he had to leave because his dog seemed like she wanted to go home. He mentioned that he hoped he saw me later that night and that he was meeting up with from friends, hopefully back at the same bar.  After he left I some friends were playing a show at a coffee shop, so I left to go to that for about an hour. After I went back to the original bar and saw the guy again. He actually approached me outside! We talked more, I met his friends. We exchanged numbers and boom 8-)  So yes. Successful night, indeed. Met some new people.

AskTrollX,3cx3cg,koh522,8,Sat Jul 11 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"It would be very beneficial for you to get a consistent person. Do you have any certified nurse midwives or other nurse practitioners in your area? A midwife - whether a CNM, CM, lay midwife, or what have you - is trained in comprehensive women's health, particularly but not limited to reproductive health. A CNM is a nurse practitioner with a master's degree in midwifery. Copay/out of pocket for the nurse is way less than for an MD, and I'd argue that for your needs you will get better care seeing the same CNM over time than random doctors at the clinic.  I'm sorry I'm not more helpful. It sounds like consistent care is what you need but aren't getting."

My husband, both my little sisters, and 2 of my besties are also in the party. And because I love them all so much, here's a quick rundown of their characters.  Sister 1 is a 13 year old human rogue assassin who was taken in by a dwarven baker. The baker is a member of an assassin guild and specializes in poisoned baked goods. He's been teaching my sister's character everything he knows. He also wears a frilly pink apron.  Sister 2 is a elven druid who was raised by gay werewolf parents. Yes, werewolves are actually civilized in my world.   Husband is a human ranger raised in the woods by nomadic monks. He has a pet hawk he has raised from birth. He also has mysterious origins that we're going to be exploring soon. (Hi, honey! I know you'll be reading this! :D)  Besty 1 is a elven cleric and my character's half-sister. They don't know this yet, though. Her character was raised by hobbits, so she refuses to wear armor on her feet and automatically ducks walking into any structure.  Besty 2 is a dwarven bard. She also has some mysterious origins that will be coming out soon. She's trying to regain something precious that she lost."

It's suffocatingly crowded (literally, good luck seeing the whole dealers hall in 4 days unless you plan to do nothing else), lines for anything amazing will waste your whole day (my friend waited in the How I Met Your Mother line for 6 hours and didn't get in), the prices of food/ hotels/ ANYTHING are jacked up because of the con, and you will, almost no exceptions, get the flu and spend a few days after your vay-kay throwing up all your insides.  It can be fun, but can also be SO miserable for all those reasons. So, if you're in need of comfort, there it is.  That said, if I ever go again before I'm a professional, I'd really like to get back into cosplay; I'd love to cosplay as Ramona Flowers and Knives Chau with my best friend.

Look for anything that will pay for your MBA as a part of compensation.  Work for a few years, because no one takes an MBA seriously if it doesn't also accompany a few years of corporate work experience.  Most companies that pay for an MBA expect you to work while you take classes (because full time is only like 6 credit hours), so be warned that they are going to want you to go to a university that won't require a move.  If you are targeting specific universities, you should look for employment near those places."

We kept that up for a while. Movies, sex, every week or so. We chatted like friends. Then one night my roommates were being the biggest fucking bitches, being all loud and roudy and shit. I told them I had a HUGE plant test the next day; specie ID, common and scientific name, obligate status, depth to groundwater, succession. I tell you this so you know this is bitching test and that were classmates, he knows the difficulty. I asked him to come pick me up and study at his place. Not only does he come over, he walked in and verbally stripped them down. The next week he had a terrible PTSD episode and disappeared for a week. When he came back I sat him down and told him how I felt for him. It let him open up about how he felt that I was a very important person to him.

They just don't offer an export feature so once I get everyone in the calendar they can't come out. I also don't like Punchbowl's customer service so there's that - too. I think the problem is there just aren't a lot of options that are well used to get an idea from. I can think of Facebook's birthday reminders and that's it. But I kind of realize there's not a lot of options so I just wondered from other person to other person, what they use. I have two people say they just use Google calendars.   I like Punchbowl because it's essentially a live excel list, which you can switch to calendar view too I think. But I prefer the straight list with organized dates. And then it emails you 7 days before, 3 days before, and on your friend's day. Gives me time to decide on presents and stuff and keeps me on track.   For me I like the ease of a straight list that sends emails to remind me, like Punchbowl's list - but is portable in the management of contacts.   I'm going to take a look at all your suggestions. Love it. Thank you!"

It has a calendar view and a list view (so does Agenda Calendar 4), this article has an in-depth review and screenshots if that helps. The best thing about the app is it parses your natural language. You can type in ""mom's birthday october 8 alert 10 days"" and it'll set up an event called ""mom's birthday"" for october 8 all day and set up the reminder for 10 days in advance. You get the idea.  Sunrise has some great syncing and exporting features and it's free (they have a free desktop version too)."

AskTrollX,3cpx4p,VestaDear,3,Fri Jul 10 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the thickness of your hair. If you have thick hair, an undercut would look better than if you have thin hair.   For example, I have thin hair on the top of my head and it gets thicker down from that, so I would look really bad with an undercut."
AskTrollX,3cpx4p,TantalizingTroupial,2,Fri Jul 10 17:59:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like mine is around medium but the lower end, close to thin, but I'm not totally sure."
AskTrollX,3cpx4p,ed077,2,Fri Jul 10 19:51:12 2015 UTC,Do it!
AskTrollX,3cpx4p,bonifate,2,Fri Jul 10 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"If you want it, do it! The good thing about undercuts is that if you can't really tell it's there if your hair is down. I had one for a while and I loved it. The feeling of just-shaved hair is really nice. The only downside is that growing it out is a pain, so you've gotta be prepared for a few months of funky looking hair (unless you're braver than me and cut the whole lot short)."
AskTrollX,3cpx4p,Lanilegend,2,Fri Jul 10 08:49:32 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I came here to say. Growing it back out is a pain in the ass, so many hairpins to hold it up off my neck when it was growing out. I will say I loved it when I had it and it kept me cool in the heat, but god I was a pain to grow out so it was the same length as the rest of my hair."
AskTrollX,3cpx4p,Carolimerose,2,Fri Jul 10 18:00:50 2015 UTC,YES!

AskTrollX,3coegn,Kawi44,7,Thu Jul 9 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"So, I am an Indigenous University student who is extremely involved off and on campus. To be honest I have worked very hard to put myself out there and get involved in any way I can, both in terms of being involved in Indigenous movements/activities and school/community projects.   Last night a friend of mine called me and offered me an almost garunteed spot in an all expense  paid internship through the organization Canada World Youth. The internship would be for 4 months and it would be in Colombia. WOW. I know. Here is the catch, I have to decide by this weekend and I would have to leave within the next few weeks.   I have a boyfriend who I love dearly and have been with for a year now, I'm not sure we could get through something like this. I'm supposed to be starting my second year of University, this internship would only count for 4 credits and would (paired with other factors ) push my graduation back a year. I really don't know if this is even something that I want. I feel horribly stressed and I can't stop beating myself up over this.   I do not know what I want to do. I also have another organisation that has offered me a position within a mentorship program for Indigenous children in foster care, it wouldn't be a huge adjustment in my life and is also something I would love.   I KNOW this is an amazing oppurtunity, but I can't help but feel like it is too much too fast. While at the same time feeling like this isn't the kind of thing I should turn down. :(((("
AskTrollX,3coegn,dbarefoot,25,Thu Jul 9 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"First, I'm a dude, so discount my advice as needed. But I'm a fellow Canadian, so round up accordingly. Congrats on the opportunity.  Science tells us that we regret the stuff we don't do far more than the stuff we do. So, missed opportunities feel worse in the long run than opportunities we took that didn't work out.  So, regardless of how it works out, you're likely to be happier that you took the chance to go to Colombia than not.  University will always be there, and if you're meant to stick with your boyfriend, then four months won't change that. Chances to go to Colombia don't come along every day."
AskTrollX,3coegn,soleoblues,15,Thu Jul 9 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Paid for? I'd do it. I'd check to make certain I'm not required to pay back everything if I leave early, and find out if they'd pay for a flight back if I needed to leave (or make sure I have enough to pay for that ticket home).  Otherwise? They have internet down there. Which means you can skype and chat and email. They have mail services too, so you can mail things to each other.   Would the other org/foster care one let you do that when you return?  Because THAT would be amazing.  Would you get pissed with yourself if you didn't take up this offer? If it doesn't go well (because hey, it might not), will you hate yourself for doing it? And would you want to travel to Columbia later? Because they're paying for it now."
AskTrollX,3coegn,coffinnail_,13,Thu Jul 9 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"You've got two really great responses here already, but I came to add a bit of a personal experience touch because this question is all too familiar for me. My really good friend is an Indigenous university student at UBC and he had an opportunity to go to SA to work on a project .... he said no because him and his girlfriend were having issues and he didn't think they'd get through it. Two years later, they just broke up and he regrets not taking a lot of opportunities that were handed to him earlier in his schooling.     Go. Embrace what life is gifting you. If you and your SO make it through, perfect. If not, it will be sad... but you will grow so much on this journey! Please take it!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,smartache,7,Thu Jul 9 15:42:34 2015 UTC,It is very rare in life to be able to travel and have new experiences for free. DO IT!
AskTrollX,3coegn,_ChipSkylark,5,Thu Jul 9 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"First of all: I would totally go for it! Sounds like a really amazing once in a lifetime opportunity that you'll definitely regret if you don't do it. Everyone should jump into something like this head first once in their life :) Besides that I would definitely give your uni a call to see what classes you can do in the second semester, so you won't delay your graduation by a whole year.   Also I lived in Australia for a year while my boyfriend was still back home. 4 months is very doable!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,IamDaisyBuchananAMA,4,Thu Jul 9 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"I am in the DO IT camp. If your relationship can't survive this, then I don't think it could survive the trials and tribulations of marriage. Think about all the good you can do for the Indigenous children who need you. You will never have an opportunity like this ever again.  Make a list of pros and cons and think deeply about it for a day if you're still not sure."
AskTrollX,3coegn,barking-chicken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:27:22 2015 UTC,"Arguably, the entire point of life is to experience it.  There's not many times you'll get an opportunity to do it for free.  Tell your boyfriend you'll see him on Skype, put off graduation a year and go! Check with your advisors before hand to make sure you don't have any classes that will be totally screwed over (I had some that were only offered every other spring semester), but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
AskTrollX,3coegn,halomomma,9,Thu Jul 9 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Old person checking in.  DO IT!  I was lucky enough to travel quite a bit during my college years and they are still some of the best memories of my life and really helped make me the person I am today.  You can't get the opportunity back, so please take advantage!  No one knows what might happen as far as the relationship goes, but the chance to expand yourself so much is undeniable.  Good luck!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,ScotchMcBagpipe,5,Thu Jul 9 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"DO IT! The things in life that scare you and excite you are always the best. It means you really want to do it (the thought of it excites you) - but you're letting fear dictate (you're scared). Anytime you feel the fear and do it anyway, it's amazing and you'll feel, and be, unstoppable. That's how you get empowered. This has become my anthem when making decisions like this...   Edit: forgot link!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,ScotchMcBagpipe,2,Thu Jul 9 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing, I don't know if it excites me. I've mostly just been feeling scared. Scared and nervous and confused and a wreck.   I know it is something I should be excited about but I can't feel much other than scared so far. That and already missing everyone here so damn much."
AskTrollX,3coegn,i_fake_it,2,Thu Jul 9 18:13:56 2015 UTC,"Aw - so it's more like you feel like you should want to do it more that you actually want to do it... I sympathize. The best I can say is, don't make the decision out of fear (I'm afraid my boyfriend won't be there when I get back, I'm afraid I won't make friends, etc.). Don't let fear run the show, that's a recipe for a very boring and unfulfilling life. If you say no, do it because, again, fear aside, it doesn't interest you. It's not something you want to do; it's not of interest to you. Another thought is fake it til you make it. Sometimes you're so stuck in your own shit that you don't really know who you are or what you want. So think - do you want to be the type of person who would do something like this? Would be admire someone for doing something like this? Guess what then, you're that person then, you're just letting fear get in the way. If not though, maybe you just really don't want to go!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,CeseED,2,Thu Jul 9 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"I felt mostly just scared before I moved to Paris for half a year. I was homesick before I left, felt horrible for the first few weeks there because I missed my family and friends and knew I wouldn't see them for months, and I was in a strange country and living with a strange family and I barely spoke the language, and I would lose a semester at University. And that was over a decade ago, in a time when wireless internet was not as common as it is now. I barely ever got to talk to my family and friends.  But honestly, going to Paris was one of the best decisions I ever made. I grew so much as a person in those six months, and learned so much about myself. It was such a great experience - I would do it again in a heartbeat. I ended up loving my time there, it was truly amazing.  So I would very strongly recommend you go! Worst case you have a miserable four months, which won't affect your life in the long run. If your relationship can't take a four-month separation, chances are it won't last anyway. Sooner or later it will be tested by things much more difficult to overcome. And best-case scenario you will have an amazing experience that will help you grow as a person and might really help to shape your future. Also because this looks great on a CV.  The basis for all my major life decisions is asking myself what 80-year-old me will wish I had done now. What do you think 80-year-old you will wish you had done? That's what you should do."
AskTrollX,3coegn,soleoblues,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"Those feelings are also complimentary of excitement. I personally would do it. You only get these types of experiences once in a blue moon. If you and your boyfriend are made to work, you'll work at it!"
AskTrollX,3coegn,amsbkwrm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"Man, it IS scary -- and that's ok! You're going to a different continent where you don't have your circle of friends.  But! Everyone else there will be in the same situation. Making friends is pretty easy as a result. And for most of you, this will be your first trip there -- meaning, there will be lots of chances to go exploring, try new places, meet new people, and make some wonderful experiences.  It is hard to separate the fear from the excitement -- fear is a powerful emotion. Tell your boyfriend, or a really close friend, and ask them to hang out with you for a couple of hours and be really over the top excited for you. If, after that period, you're still just scared? Then you have an answer with how you really feel. If you feel that budding of excitement, along with all those other feelings -- well. You've got your answer too.   I've jumped at the chance to travel whenever it comes, so I'm probably a little biased.   Also -- if your bf doesn't have it already, he has some time to get his passport. Imagine showing him around at the end of your time there -- all the places you've found, the local restaurants and bars, the friends you've made. Playdream a bit.  Good luck!"

AskTrollX,3coebf,bsmith84,3,Thu Jul 9 14:08:03 2015 UTC,I think it's totally cute! It should work great. The heels dress it up a bit. The only thing I would suggest is you might want to consider sandals if you're going to be on the sand at all.
AskTrollX,3coebf,Ormagan,2,Thu Jul 9 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would suggest taking the heels, and either a pair of sandals or flats thy match, to adjust appropriately."

I agree with everyone saying a statement necklace, and you may also want to get a light thin cardigan.

I'll just keep being the squeaky wheel. :)
AskTrollX,3cpg8y,traveling_cat-lady,3,Fri Jul 10 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"So I have had knee pain my entire life. After going to countless surgeons I finally found one who figured out the problem. My femurs and tibias are angled all wrong. Anyway, after the first month of testing and imaging - which was pushed through rather quickly - everything has slowed waaaaaaay down.  In one of the MRI's we discovered I have a mass in my femur. He told me he was sending it up to a specialist and that was a month ago.  The first appointment was back in April, the mass found in May (and incase you need the reminder [ok I just want to type in my yelling voice] IT IS FUCKING JULY NOW!!!!!!!).  How do I get this surgeon - who is really well reviewed and renowned - to pay attention to my case?"
AskTrollX,3cpg8y,jemillet23,3,Thu Jul 9 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're getting some answers! I really hope to get even more information soon and the appointments happen quickly.   Have you contacted the specialist? Or was your doctor supposed to make the appointment? If you haven't heard of an actual date for an appointment, I would call whoever was supposed to make the appointment. If there is an appointment, but just not for a while, I would call and ask if there was a way you could be worked in earlier. I've called doctors office every day that I'm available to try and see if there was a cancellation for each day. Good luck!!"

I actually work with doctors and lawyers at my job, and I can tell you... for people with such expertise, they are some of the least professional people I've ever worked with.  The easiest way to get a hold of a doctor is to call the clinic they work at and ask to speak with their assistant or a nursing staff member.  Don't leave a message to their personal voicemail, it'll get lost or they won't answer it.  You have to be persistent and annoying.  He's not ignoring you or your case, he's most likely just freakishly busy.  I would also try calling your doctor who found the mass in your femur to see if he can throw some weight around and get this pushed through faster.

He was quite level headed for the most part, and was extremely respectful and cooperative when I broke things off and kicked him out. He just didn't really have his own hobbies, and was maybe a little too excited about the whole being in a relationship and living together thing.

He agreed at first, but after 2 weeks he started totally losing it. Why don't I want to be with him? Why do I need space? Am I falling out of love with him? I felt like I was suffocating.

I also feel totally fine with going to a coffee shop or bookstore and being alone even though there are strangers around me.  When my ex and I moved into together we had the same class schedule for school but we also had other activities that made us not have issues spending too much time together. When we were both home we would talk and hang out but we also were fine about doing our own things.

I brought this to his attention multiple times and quite bluntly. The only time he does something about it is when I'm already physically upset and think about moving out.

If clothing is something that really bugs you, would you be ok with doing his laundry when you do yours (including folding and putting away)? If he cooks every day, and does the dishes - that's kind of like equal work. Laundry is easy once you get it sorted out from the bad place it's in, keeping on top of it can be a breeze. Just fold it while watching tv or something so it doesn't feel like it's forever."
AskTrollX,3cn5te,coffinnail_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I take care of his dogs and do the dishes and sweep. I wash and dry the clothes that's why there's 3 baskets of his clean laundry (they would all be dirty). In his defense, he goes outside to work and I stay inside and work online but the one thing I really really really don't want to be is a housewife. A trade off sounds very fair but I don't know what else to trade lol thank you for the advice!"
AskTrollX,3cn5te,Furfaidz,2,Thu Jul 9 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"Not wanting to put away clothes isn't that bad. Leaving them on the floor in every room, though? I mean, how does he justify that? I wouldn't want to clean up someone's every day messes just because they weren't bothered. If he's capable of removing his clothes, he's capable of putting them somewhere other than the floor. He's not two and you're not his mum.   Could you try having a couple more hampers around the house? One in the bathroom, bedroom and maybe another one in the hallway near the kitchen?"

Then those towels have to go somewhere and only two fit on the back of the door so they go in the hamper and then I'm washing 10 fucking towels a week because he showers like three times a day sometimes!   It took me awhile to get the hang of, but now I've got a laundry system down where I'm on top of it always. I don't mind as much about all the clothes anymore.

AskTrollX,3cn5te,JoyfulStingray,2,Thu Jul 9 11:41:24 2015 UTC,Can you be in the same room with your SO to recharge?  Is your SO also an introvert?  We live in a 2 bedroom apartment so there is plenty room to be apart but we can also do 2 separate activities while being in the same room.  I will knit or read while he plays video games or surf the net.  There can be entire evenings where we don't talk.  But we really like recharging by watching TV together.  :)  It really helps that he is more of an introvert than I am so I don't have to worry about him being in my face all the time.
AskTrollX,3cn5te,JoyfulStingray,5,Thu Jul 9 13:03:50 2015 UTC,He is definitely less introverted than me.  He likes to sit beside be whatever we're doing.  I'm the kind of person who could happily go days without interaction.
AskTrollX,3cn5te,DatShitIsWack,2,Thu Jul 9 14:04:56 2015 UTC,My sister is dating a guy significantly more extroverted than her and she needs alone time.  She just expresses to him that she needs to recharge and not talk for a while and he is cool with it.  :)
AskTrollX,3cn5te,DatShitIsWack,2,Thu Jul 9 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"As the extroverted SO of an introvert, it helped me the most when he told me what he needed. He explained to me that he needs to recharge by doing low-key alone or couples activities. I recharge by socializing with other people. So we compromise a lot and communicate a lot. Sometime he'll go out and socialize with me one night and we'll just chill the next night or two. Sometime I'll go out and meet with friends and let him chill home alone.   If you have activities that you like to do to recharge, make those a priority. Make it clear that you need these things to recharge. If you need your SO out of the house, ask them to pursue a hobby or hang out with their friends at the bar. I think scheduling these sorts of things in advance (as much as possible) helps us out the most. We have keywords assigned to various activities that make it clear what we each need (Pizza night is a night in with netflix/video games, pub night is solo/couples chat night, etc). Practice makes perfect, though. Communicate, communicate, communicate!"
AskTrollX,3cn5te,DatShitIsWack,2,Thu Jul 9 13:52:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's unfair for me to ask him to give me the room to myself.

AskTrollX,3cn5te,EvelynGarnet,2,Thu Jul 9 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you should feel comfortable in your space, too!   I never feel like it's unfair when my SO asks for something he needs. Sometimes I ask him to grab some groceries, sometimes he asks me for a couple hours of time, sometimes I ask him to get the laundry when he gets home, sometimes he goes on a long run without me. It's a relationship, we compromise because we want to make it work.  If your SO feels it's unfair that he has to go to the movies (or whatever) one night a week without you, then he should feel comfortable telling you that and proposing an alternative. Maybe you trade one night alone a week for one night of doing something with him a week. Make it work for both of you!"
AskTrollX,3cn5te,stefaniey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:19:32 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  I always have to remind myself that I can ask for things.

AskTrollX,3cn5te,neish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I've mastered the art of convincing my SO to play new games since he gets easily engrossed and it makes him happy. I know what games he likes and I pick them up when they're cheap on steam. Sometimes he's reluctant to play something new, so I'll play it for a bit until he's convinced.   I have a waitlist on isthereanydeal and get an email when a game goes on sale. $2 for Dishonored, $9 for Wasteland 2, a couple bucks for a humble bundle now and then... keeps the introvert recharged which lets the extrovert get out more.

So now I have to wear headphones to watch stupid YouTube videos and have to take them out every minute because he wants to ask me a random question.   I was lucky that we had different schedules and I got alone time at home and in the car.   When I do it again, I'd lay down the groundwork: ""I need a certain amount of alone time to refresh.

It's exhausting having to talk to and be around the kids all the time.  I generally try to take time to myself when I can. Even if it's only for a few minutes. Sometimes they search me out and find me though. (Que Psycho theme music here)  My husband also doesn't like to talk, but he's a bit of a toucher,  and sometimes I just need to not be touched.  So I escape. Either go shopping by myself (not the best way to be alone, but I can at least hear myself think) ,  or have a bath or just take time in the garden or something. If I seem busy, they are less likely to find me and bother me.  I also made our bedroom into a sanctuary with a lock. So I can go in there and read or something when times get tough.  As for making my husband realizes that I need a moment or two to myself.. I just said it, and hoped for understanding. He was pretty insulted at first, tbh.  I think he knows now though, because my mood improves so much after having some time to myself.  If they really don't understand, than really, they aren't worth it, imo."

Believe it or not, during my last two interviews I've been told that my (un-rehearsed, completely true) answers were too good. This morning my interviewer literally told me ""it's like you had studied the perfect answers"" - but the thing is, they were the perfect answers because I applied to a place whose principles matched mine, so of course what I believe in is what they believe in :/"
AskTrollX,3cliq7,TweasureTwoll,5,Wed Jul 8 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I know this isn't helpful to your actual question, but I just wanted to chime in to say I know how you feel and how goddamn frustrating this is. Interviewing is such a bitch. You really can't win.   I find I get the best reactions (in certain scenarios -- you have to read the room) when I give it to them straight. In the anecdote you just described, I would have retorted by telling them what you told us: ""Honestly, I prepared for this interview because I want this job and any good candidate prepares for an interview. But I didn't study the perfect answers; I'm being myself, and I think it's a testament to what a great fit I am to your organization that our principles match so closely. My answers aren't rehearsed.""   But there are schools of thought that say this is a god awful approach. It varies so much from one place to another. One place appreciates it if you really get down and dirty, while another wants you to toe the party line. Sometimes it's impossible to tell what the hell they want from you.   My best suggestion is to try to get a read for the place as much as you can before they ask you that. How are they dressed? What does the office look like? What's their approach to asking you questions? Is their interview style conversational or ""by the book""? Etc.  This is all coming from a fellow troll who can't find a new job to save her damn life, so take it with a grain of salt."

Am I getting this right though that more formal looking interviewers who obviously have a well thought out procedure in place like people to ""tip toe"" around, while less formally dressed interviewers who aren't as organized prefere answers to be ""down and dirty""?"
AskTrollX,3cliq7,_tarasbulba,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:17:05 2015 UTC,"Nothing is a hard and fast rule. That's the damn bitch of it. I think you have to go to as many interviews as possible (never turn one down, even if you know you don't want the job!) to start getting a real sixth sense for this sort of thing. The formality of dress may not have to do with it (that's more of a corporate culture sort of thing), but body language might be a giveaway (leaning back in the chair, rolling up sleeves, etc.)  Also, I challenge you to rephrase this statement: ""I personally know that I am a bad person and that there's several people out there who'd do a much better job than I would.""  You are not a bad person. That is not a fact. There might be people out there that would do  better job than you, sure. That's true of absolutely everybody. But you have to sell yourself like you are the best, and you don't have to do that by being a cocky jerkwad. I'm telling you this for my own benefit, too; I also have shit self esteem, and people SENSE this. I think it's a big reason I don't get work. There's a sort of energy you put out when you are filled with self hatred that others pick up on.  When you walk into an interview, pretend you are about to meet up with old friends. Be charming and cordial. Go in smiling. Sit up straight. Don't talk too much -- listening is more important. Don't apologize for anything. Don't bring up your weaknesses unless prompted. Never bring up anything negative about yourself (this is tough for me; I catch myself saying, ""well, I know that I'm not particularly well versed in X skill, but..."" NO NO NO THIS IS A BAD THING TO SAY!)  I hope this helps. I have been getting further in interviews lately. I have gotten to the stage where I am usually one of the finalists now, instead of getting the boot after the first round. Also the last two or three jobs I didn't get was because the jobs were pulled entirely and nobody was hired. This is a huge step up from a few years ago when I could barely even get interviews to begin with.   HUSTLE, GIRL."

These two grouped questions are going to give you more knowledge about how a person operates and recovers from a mistake than asking the basic ""weakness"" question.

If I were in your shoes, I'd probably try to turn it around a little. ""I don't have a biggest weakness, I have weaknesses that I've turned into strengths and weaknesses that I will turn into strengths.

I started freaking out, but then I talked to a doc and did some research. It turns out that the very high amount of hormones in the MA pill can fuck with your cycle (obviously), which can lead to pregnancy-like symptoms and your period being a few days late. I highly doubt that you're pregnant.  ...but if you are (you're not), and for everyone who has the possibility of experiencing an unplanned pregnancy: if you are, you are. It sucks but it's not unlike any other setback in life. You find a way to work through it, and then you do. You will surprise yourself with your own strength.   Good luck OP!"

I don't want to give you too much unasked for advice because you know your body and mind better than anyone, however I had very similar phobias when I first started having sex and looking back on them I feel like part of that stemmed from me not being ready to be a sexually active person.

We used a condom, it didn't slip off, but it did roll down his penis when he was in me. He did not cum inside of me, but I accidentally touched myself with the same hand that had his pre-cum on it. My finger did not go inside my vagina and as soon as I realized I peed, rinsed my vagina and hands with water and soap. I took a plan-B 23-26 hours later. I had what seemed to be a second period 5 days later. It was not spotting, it was a relatively normal to heavy flow and lasted a few days shorter than a normal period.  I've been feeling nauseous and have been having really bad headaches. My boobs may be bigger. I developed a pooch before this happened, but it looks like it might be bigger. I'm ridiculously scared I'll get a positive test result. Or it'll be a false negative or positive. Please tell me I'm just psyching myself out.

They don't tell this to teenagers (for good reason) but there's only a 12-24 HOUR window during your cycle where you can get pregnant. This window is generally around 14ish days before your period. If you're stressing this badly, then take a test. The dollar store ones are the exact same as the expensive ones.

Uh... this isn't true... *   While it's true the egg only lives for 24 hours and if not fertilized within that time period it will die... there's no real way to know when that window actually is.  It's ""roughly"" 14 days into the cycle, but that 14 days is an average.  Unless you're using some very specific testing, it's damn near impossible to tell what 24 hour period your egg is alive and receptive for.  Plus sperm can live for 3-5 days.   Using this as pregnancy advice is rather misleading."
AskTrollX,3cl0my,mizzlebizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"Obviously the 14ish days is an average- there is huge variability in people. And it's not 14 (to use a number) days into the cycle, it's 14 days before your period (so half way if a person has a perfect 28 day cycle, but not necessarily). Luteal phases, on average, are pretty set for each person (and that is, on average around 10-14 days. For me and my shitty reproductive system, it's 8.) What causes variability in one person's cycle lengths is the follicular phase, which can change from cycle to cycle. And it's not that hard to figure out when your egg is viable- it's viable right after ovulation for approximately 12-24 hours. This can be determined through ovulation predictor strips that test levels of luteinizing hormone, or through a temperature shift of your basal body temperature, or through blood work to test your level of progesterone. If there is sperm there waiting to meet it, or if they show up soon- conception happens (or, you know, doesn't in my case)."
AskTrollX,3cl0my,DoubleDoubleA,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"Right!  I agree with all of that :)    Yes the egg is only able to be fertilized for about 24 hours from it's release.  My point was that to use this as pregnancy/sex advice for (what I took to be, and could very much be wrong) a teenager, is not so good.  Because sperm can live for 3 - 5 days.  So for all practical purposes (i.e. someone not actively tracking their ovulation or trying to get pregnant), they don't know when that 24 hour window occurs.  So, by not knowing, to that person the window becomes 3 - 5 days.  At a point in their cycle roughly around the 14 day mark, but also very variable.  So I could see someone thinking they had unprotected sex two days after they've stopped bleeding and assume they can't get pregnant, when in all honesty, they very much could become pregnant from that particular sexual encounter."

AskTrollX,3cipt9,isprobablygross,19,Wed Jul 8 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"Its pervasive in our culture, this idea that all men are always up for sex if theres even a remote possibility of it, and that the woman in question matters little. Like that cruel joke of 'just put a bag on her head and it will be fine' or how Ethel the laughingstock is the only unattractive female in Riverdale, and how that theme repeats itself in media.  How is it possible to get past that idea?    That was the important stuff, everything below is unimportant background stuff in case context helps  Im definitely a feminist and its important to me that men are supported in a full range of emotions, experiences, and bodily autonomy. But my emotions have a harder time accepting what my brain knows.  I have a much, much higher libido than my man does. We have sex regularly, yet anytime he doesnt feel like it, I feel crushed. I feel unattractive, disgusting, defective, nasty, and worthless. Like less than a woman, and like something is deeply wrong with me.  I put in a lot of effort to not letting him know I feel this way, because the last thing I want is for him to feel pressured sexually. I feign casualness for as long as I can, anywhere from 10-30 minutes, then I go to the shower and silently cry my eyes out. He probably thinks I'm masturbating, so he doesnt interrupt.  Ive tried reading feminist books like The Beauty Myth and stuff like that to try to not feel such a strong obligation to be attractive. I was brought up to believe that it is an important MORAL imperitive.  I used to have major body issues, way bigger than just the rejection issue. The books and temporary free therapy helped alot.   But I still get that same feeling of being crushed when he isnt turned on by me.   How do you get over that stereotype that every man could and should be turned on by everyone but the most disfigured? That neither he or you are defective?   How do you get over this feeling that instantly vaporises the rational knowledge that its a limiting stereotype?"

AskTrollX,3cipt9,thumbtack22,2,Wed Jul 8 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you obviously know that men aren't libido-machines, but how much critical thinking have you done about women and shame in terms of sexual arousal? I wonder if some of your negative self-image might be related to feeling like embarrassed or ashamed for being a turned on, desirous woman. I think the social narrative about men always being turned on frames happy, consensual encounters as something men necessarily initiate, and which women passively allow, which of course is not the reality of people's sex. But that narrative diminishes women's active sexual desire, and slut-shaming and emphasis on virginity and other similar social artifacts help to preserve the idea that sexuality is something men do to women. This also serves to make women feel excessive and masculine when they experience sexual desire, especially if you make a sexual advance toward a man and he rejects it, and it allows men to act as if a woman expressing her desire his a novel, abnormal thing.  You know it's not fair to blame your partner for being in the mood, but you also shouldn't blame yourself for being in the mood. It's totally okay for you to feel super horny, and if you want to masturbate a lot that's totally cool, too. Your sexual desire doesn't need to match your partners, and you don't need to be worried that your sexual desire makes you an unattractive or unfeminine partner. You should feel relaxed and confident about your body and know that you can use it to make yourself feel good, and also that it isn't threatening to your partner for you to do so."

AskTrollX,3cipt9,cerealkillergoat,14,Thu Jul 9 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"It's happened to me in two previous relationships. I had a Way higher libido than them. We matched at first then after a few months theirs drops to nothing. It almost seems like a punishment for making them feel less manly. Both men said that my approaching them for sex either subtly or straight out made them feel defective. They felt like there was something wrong with them that they didn't want sex as much as I did. The last one asked me to stop making any approach or asking at all. When when he was ready he would check in with me. It is soul destroying. I felt hideous. I drank more and ate more and gained weight and felt like I was then as revolting as they must think I was. All sorts of reasons were suggested by them both, as I talked to them about it about monthly during the year and 2 years we were together respectively. Boredom, stress, lack of sleep, lack of exercise, depression, libido mid-match, fear of commitment, fear of abandonment, the list goes on and none of it helped me. I was patient and stayed back and didn't pressure. Apparently whatever I did wasn't enough and both of them broke if off with me as they couldn't stand feeling so un-manly. My presence was a reminder that their libido was ""defective"", because they should want it more than me. Fucked up, but there you go. I never felt better during the relationships. I tried. I am regularly admired and hit on by friends and strangers even when I am with a partner,  so I had validation that I was attractive and very much so. I had physical contact and cuddles and snuggles above the waist only. What I never had was the feeling of being wanted by the one person that I wanted more than anyone. It broke me. Psychologist and some time later: I don't know how I could have done it any better apart from breaking up with them sooner. Next time I will. ;) I subscribed to r/deadbedrooms for ages and felt like I belonged. It's just too depressing for me to even look at now. Have a look then leave it. I wish you all the best.

My first marriage was like the relationships you describe, & yeah, it absolutely destroyed my self esteem.  We've been divorced for 5 years & I'm still recovering.   I begged my husband for years to talk to me about it, or talk to a therapist about it; just to care that he never wanted to have sex with me (did you go through the ""he must have a weird/distasteful fetish he's hiding from me"" stage?).  Eventually  I did the most cowardly thing I've ever done & cheated on him. I mean, I told him for months that it was going to happen as I was getting increasingly desperate for any affection whatsoever. told him specifically ""I am going away this weekend to sleep with someone else, unless you can give me a compelling reason to stay."" But still, I did it, & though it finally got me out of a dead marriage, I have to live with it.   I'm sorry you're going through this, OP, I think I know exactly how you feel. I know it's really, really hard but try to care for yourself. If you're truly unhappy with having gained weight, lose it. If fancy knickers make you feel sexy, wear 'em.  When your mind says ""of course he doesn't want you, look at (enter dumb flaw here), try like hell to stop that thought in its tracks. I find that saying to myself ""what would you tell your friend about her weight/face/hair/whatever?"" works bc I am far kinder & more loving to my friends than myself.

AskTrollX,3cipt9,dutchesse,4,Wed Jul 8 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"Im so sorry you went through that. It must hurt so much to be told that an ingrained part of you makes them feel unmanly. Thank you for the hugs, it sounds like you need some too :more hugs!:   I am regularly admired and hit on by friends and strangers even when I am with a partner, so I had validation that I was attractive and very much so. I had physical contact and cuddles and snuggles above the waist only. What I never had was the feeling of being wanted by the one person that I wanted more than anyone. It broke me.   I feel so similar. I get hit on, but it doesn't make me feel attractive and it certainly doesnt make me feel wanted. Then the feminist part of my brain starts to whisper 'should I have to feel wanted?' I dont know. It seems like a basic emotional need, but it also dovetails with pervasive sexism.   I tried posting to DeadBedrooms once; I found it to be a massively messy mistake.  There was one point many years ago we talked about there being a libido mismatch. The first time we talked he blamed me for wanting it too much, then he apologized and he never brought it up again. During that time we talked about many things that he thought deeply about- was he asexual, did he feel attraction to men, is there too much stress with his job, is his depression still under control, does he feel fully healed from his last relationship. He also insisted on getting tested for testosterone levels. Everything pointed to a man who is perfectly healthy, heterosexual, happy with his job. He even open mindedly suggested we could talk about opening up the relationship for me only, but for me sex is too closely entwined with love to separate.  He SAID at that point that he would ideally like sex once a day, but after the talk it slipped again. He very rarely initiates and only responds to my advances once a week. Given that there was nothing underneath that would threaten the stability of our relationship, I decided that it would cause undue stress to him to talk about it again.   In fact in the beginning of our relationship so many years ago he lied to me about it. He specifically told me that he had a high libido because I told him that it was an important part of me. Then when we had the libido disparity talk a couple of years after it dropped off, he admitted that this had been a sore point in his previous long term relationships as well.   Unfortunately in one of those he was regularly belittled because of it until they divorced because of this and many other reasons. So I have to be extra sensitive about my approach to it.   Being honest I was really hoping he was asexual. Before The Talk we had, I did an experiment and waited to see how long it would take for him to come on to me or notice if I didn't initiate sex. I gave up at the three month mark. When I went so long without sex, I stopped wanting sex. I havent felt as close to at peace since. If only he would have allowed our relationship to be a sexless one I am sure I would be a far less wounded person today. Its the wanting to be wanted and being left found wanting that hurts the most.   I love him and who he is so immensely that it makes my heart hurt. He is quite simply the love of my life. I can't imagine loving someone else. I would also gladly live the rest of my life without sex to be happily with him. Its just the painful constant sandpapering of this wound that I cant handle."

Then the feminist part of my brain starts to whisper 'should I have to feel wanted?' I dont know.   I get where you're coming from. But I think us feminists sometimes get too caught up in philosophical concepts of independence. Sure, our happiness shouldn't solely depend on our relationship status or the validation of men, but let's face it, everybody wants to feel wanted. And there is a big difference between our self-esteem being solely dependent on the validation of men in general and our self-esteem being influenced by one particular man we are in a relationship with.  Mismatched libidos are hard to deal with. They are especially hard to deal with due to all the stupid messages society drills into our heads about male and female sex drives. But I think you may really be making it worse for you by hidding how you feel from your SO. If he doesn't know how badly this affects you, he can't work with you to improve the situation.

Maybe there is something he or both of you can do to make the situation better. At least to get to the point where him not wanting sex doesn't crush you the way it does now. If you don't know how to tell him, you can show him this thread. The way you described the problem here is very non-attacking and understanding, so it might be a good starting point.  I have a very hard time dealing with rejection regarding sex coming from someone I love because sex and general physical touch are my primary ways to express affection. So if I'm rejected, I feel like not only my body but also my love and affection were rejected. Have you heard of the five languages of love? I never read the book, but I can really relate to the concept, and it made me understand my own needs in relationships much better. I'm definitely a physical-touch kind of person.

Is s/he dealing with a tough situation otherwise (family issues, financial woes, etc.?)  I had to have this conversation with my SO that believed if I didn't want sex = I didn't feel he was attractive. They're not one and the same. The last thing I wanted to do when I am stressed or struggling is have half-hearted sex with someone because then it feels like a chore and that's the last thing I want.  I want sex with my partner to be good and enjoyable, and when I do it when I'm not feeling it, that's what it becomes.  This is only my experience, but maybe it helps to see things from the other side of the fence."
AskTrollX,3cipt9,snowbabe,2,Wed Jul 8 12:37:17 2015 UTC,"Ideally I would like to have sex with an enthusiastic partner several times a day. That was our relationship for the first year too, and he told me that was his normal sex drive. Then is started to drop off and he admitted that he had always wanted a high sex drive, so when he got with me he tried a 'fake it till you make it' strategy.  I understand where he was coming from with that. Unfortunately that has since left us deeply in love but deeply mismatched in libidos.   He has said that he has always had a relatively low libido and that is was a major issue in all of his previous relationships. I understand the concept of wanting sex sometimes, though I have never felt it to the extent of people with a low libido, and I would never ever want him to have sex just for the sake of it or any reason other than passionately wanting to. Thats part of why it hurts my feelings when he doesnt want me.   I dont blame him or feel that he should change it- several years ago we had extensive talks about the issue and he examined his life, sexual desires, orientation, kinks, health, stress, and possibility of being asexual. All signs pointed to a healthy heterosexual man that once had depression but feels that it is cured or in remission.   During those deep talks he said that ideally he would want sex once a day. In practice, he only wants it once a week and very rarely initiates. Ive experimented with backing off on asking until he initiated, but I gave up after the three month mark. I felt really miserable because he said he wants sex once a day, but apparently he just doesn't want that with me, or he fibbed about that too.  Currently I initiate once a week when my feelings can handle a possibility of rejection. Sometimes I can only handle it once a month, but then he complains that I dont want sex enough. I havent brought up the libido mismatch in years and I dont pout when he rejects me because I dont want to guilt him.  I go to the shower and cry by myself.   Honestly I wish he had found that he identified as asexual. The longer I go without sex, the less I want it and the less I feel like a monster for not being wanted by someone who says he wants sex more often than he does.

AskTrollX,3cjgla,kekabillie,2,Wed Jul 8 13:41:41 2015 UTC,"Money is tight and I've been trying to get a job for a while now. According to people, I've got a good resume and good referrals but interviews are my achilles heel. I never say the things they want to hear and don't really connect with the job at hand (the unwritten things, that is). I genuinely think it's because I don't truly want the job for itself, just the money it earns. Sometimes I think the fact that I got a first job years ago was some kind of miracle.  I'm in a bind. Do I need to practice even more and use different source websites? How can I fake it to make it? I truly wish I didn't have to do interviews but just work for free for a day because I know I'm good at what I do."
AskTrollX,3cjgla,kekabillie,2,Wed Jul 8 11:42:07 2015 UTC,It's pretty standard but research the company well before the interview. Good understanding of their values will show that you cared enough to put some effort in.  What are the major skills required for this job? Are any of those aligned with ones you want to develop to further progress your career? It might help you appear genuine to root your answers in the truth even if you have to embellish a little to make it applicable to this job. Along that line you could talk about being excited to apply developed skills in a new context.
AskTrollX,3cjgla,MonkishSubset,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:45:19 2015 UTC,"I genuinely thought I had that down pat. Almost to the point where I repeating what they wrote. Still, not enthusiastic enough. I might have to embellish more though."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,CThomasFlood27,15,Tue Jul 7 15:50:15 2015 UTC,"The best answer I can give you is that it doesn't matter what other people are wearing because their feet may be different. Instead, I'd recommend going to a running shoe store and have them do a walking test with you so they give you shoes that work best for your feet.  But for me personally (in case we do have similar feet), I wear Saucony Hurricane 15s. I have a huge arch and I tend to run on the balls of my feet."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,dutchesse,3,Tue Jul 7 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"I like to get other peoples opinions, just in case there is something I haven't thought of. Someone noted an Adidas type of shoe earlier I had never even heard of."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,paint-can,3,Tue Jul 7 17:42:24 2015 UTC,Yes! The time & money spent at a specialty running store is soooooo worth it! They'll check your gait & really help!   Just to add on-- bring your old shoes (or at least take pics of the soles) as the wear pattern can help with finding the best shoe.
AskTrollX,3cfr03,CapOnFoam,7,Tue Jul 7 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"What is it that's not ""cutting it""?   I wear Brooks Adrenaline and LOVE them. I have super wide feet and they actually have enough room in them to not give me blisters. And I overpronate a lot, so they help in that regard as well.  Have you been to a local running store to have your gait checked & feet measured etc? They can help with shoe recommendations."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,CapOnFoam,5,Tue Jul 7 16:17:08 2015 UTC,"One of them tends to cut off circulation to my left foot, no matter how much I loosen my laces. The other ones are fairly broken in and I still find they hurt my feet.  There is Charm City Run down the street, I'll have to go there and see if they can check my gait."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,Divisadero,6,Tue Jul 7 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, definitely go talk to them! Be sure to tell them your budget too, so you don't feel pressured to buy something you can't afford or will regret. (Just don't then go buy the shoe they recommended online b/c it's cheaper, that's kinda rude.) I hope they can help :)"
AskTrollX,3cfr03,ShamelessFox,2,Tue Jul 7 16:22:55 2015 UTC,"Their shoes are all like $120+. I am thinking like $70-ish. They also only come in the most obnoxious of colors lol. Is that a trend for women? Really bright ass running shoes? I'm a fan of like black/gray, ya know."
AskTrollX,3cfr03,raziphel,8,Tue Jul 7 16:42:53 2015 UTC,Unfortunately so. I prefer all black everything and the supportive shoes all look like a raver barfed on them.

This was after spending about an hour there, having them measure me, check my gait, look at my arches, etc. They even showed me how to properly tie my shoes! Both my feet are wide, but... My right foot is maybe an 8.5, probably a 9. My left foot is a solid 9.5. So my shoes are (now) a 9.5 - but I had to make up for it on the smaller foot. They helped me! It was awesome.  Yes, my shoes (on sale, after taxes) were $135. Yes, they are obnoxiously bright and multi colored. Don't care. Happy feet."

Request a gait analysis. Ask to take the shoes on a test run around the parking lot. Don't be afraid of harder orthodics (those gel ones are total crap). Get the associates name so you can see them next time. Try to alternate your running shoes. I switch my new pair with my older pair every other run. get an app to track your mileage on your shoes! They're very cool & can really help you figure out what works for you. http://www.runnersworld.com/electronics/11-tracking-apps-for-runners   That being said I have Brooks Adrenalines & Asics GT-2000s. The sole on the Brooks wear out faster but the uppers are like new. The uppers on the Asics go quicker & give me blisters but they are cheaper. I use orange Superfeet orthodics.

They're really light and flexible, which I like, and they fit my big, beautiful, wide feet, which is what I need for running. On top of that, they're well ventilated, which I absolutely require. They offer what little support I need and don't do much in the way of undue rubbing after being worn a few days. I also have a pair of Nike trail running shoes, called Flex Trail, which definitely get the job done off-road."

I don't know how I feel about giving my number to people I don't know very well, I don't think I'm totally comfortable with it like I used to be when I was younger.  Is this because I'm not really ready for a new relationship or because I'm just older and more cautious?   How do you feel about giving out your number?"
AskTrollX,3cgumj,barking-chicken,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"You can create a throwaway google account and then set up google voice. There are forwarding and blocking options so you don't have to burn the number because of one idiot.  I did it for when I was applying for jobs because somehow recruiters inevitably get your number and then won't stop calling for years about jobs completely unrelated to your background.  Then, if you ever just want to burn the account completely you can just deactivate the account and blamo nobody has your real contact info."
AskTrollX,3cgumj,Kaleyedoskopic,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"I work for myself so I get unknown numbers calling me all the time. As far as dating goes, I used to not want to give my number out at all because I was worried about stalking/men not taking no for an answer. The last time I was single I kind of let it go and did give my number out, and it really wasn't a big deal. My phone also has a block function, so if anyone did get creepy, or I just didn't want to hear from someone, I would block them and move on.  With all that said, a little over a week out of a long term relationship, you probably need time, and lots of it, before you get back out there. If you're not ready to start dating, who cares if they're interested, the single men can wait. Take a breather!"
AskTrollX,3cgumj,ofquartz,2,Wed Jul 8 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's very normal to want a bit of time to yourself after the end of a serious relationship, OP! Don't give your number out if you don't feel ready for that, or if you don't want to for any reason (or no reason at all), it's 100% ok.  For me, I don't get asked often, but whether I do it depends a little on the situation. Total stranger out of the blue? Noooope. Stranger at the same gig? Probably yes, unless they're being a douche! Stranger who spots my rad Snake Plissken shirt and comes up to me for a dweeby chat about John Carpenter? Aww yeah!  Basically, in order to feel comfortable giving out my number I like to have some upfront degree of commonality or shared experience beyond merely being a fellow human at roughly the same point in space and time. I'm also not thinking about it only in the context of romantic relationships, it's that I don't generally want to spend a bunch of time awkwardly plodding through getting-to-know-you stuff only to find out there's absolutely nothing in common.

The way I talk to her about that stuff is, ""Ha, you won't believe how dumb I was at your age, listen to this! WHO WOULD DO THAT!?""  So now, for one thing, hopefully if she's in a situation to make those same mistakes, she'll think, ""Ha, WHO WOULD DO THAT!?"" and secondly, she knows that I'm not going to judge her if she tells me she did something dumb.

The oldest 3 are my dad's kids and we didn't have much of a relationship until recently when they sort of followed me to my university town. ANYWAY! The oldest one, I would have her over for movie nights sometimes and just buy a whole lot of candy. I got her into cult movies and B horrors and sometimes I specifically pick ones with something in them that I think she's struggling with (e.g. we watched 'Shrooms when her friends got into some drug stuff). We're pretty close now, but I just moved about 6 hours away. She's coming down for a few days and we're going to some street festivals and stuff.   The next 2 I'm less close to, we don't have very much in common. However, my brother (13) and I go on an annual snowboarding trip and we always have fun with that. We didn't get to go last year and he was noticeably sad, which he's never willing to show. So we're getting there.   My next sister is 11, she really likes shopping and wants to be like her other older sister and her friends way too fast. I take her shopping and to movies that the other 2 don't want to go to and we go for coffee and stuff. I treat her how she wants to be treated, but also let her do kid stuff.   Then the others.. One is a dancer and about to start grade 7 in the fall. She is much more wiling to talk to me than anyone else older, so I just let her talk about whatever she wants and laugh when appropriate and sometimes offer advice or tell her stories about when I was younger. We build snowmen and go sledding in the winter, I haven't found a summer thing we both enjoy yet. We also talk on kik messenger sometimes, she has it on her ipod.   And finally, the youngest. She has some major developmental disabilities and difficulty communicating so it's a little different. I try to let her choose things as much as possible. She likes yellow things, Frozen, freezies, rice, and Snow White. I read her stories and let her be sad when kids are mean to her.

AskTrollX,3cfpgi,Askingforst,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"So I'm not exactly young anymore and feel like I should have this figured out. But. I've only ever done ""traditional"" serious relationships and this ain't it.   I've been in a few LTRs and about three months ago met this guy online. We had a good first date (a single cup of coffee each  and even that got cold) with hours of great conversation and he drove me home.   I don't think either one of us felt any chemistry tho. Still we had such easy conversation and similar interests we continued chatting online and had a second date and a third and a fourth and they were all really fun! One of those was even a weekend camping trip with a few of his friends.   It seemed like we were completely heading for friendship. Only the text convos were somewhat suggestive and downright flirty. Even a fair bit of joking sexting.  He left the country for a month for a trip with his friends and I didn't hear anything from him then. Only a couple of days after he got back (we're FB friends so I knew when he was back) he texted me to ask me go to a dance event the next weekend. We started chatting again.   Before the set date, he asked if I wanted to come over to look through his trip photos (it was a place I'd been to and I'd actually helped plan some of the route before he left with his buddies). At that point I honestly thought, platonic.   Naive, maybe, but nothing in our IRL interaction had ever hinted at anything else.   Only we ended up having sex that night. Oops. And it was amazing. The kissing, the sex, turns out we're really compatible physically.   And so we continued. And we travelled around together, sometimes for weekends. A whole week at one point. I've met most of his friends. He's met several of mine. He includes me in stuff he organises and there are several people out there who view us as a ""serious couple"". Neither one has corrected that assumption.   But we've sat down and had the Talk. We're non-exclusive (a first for me, but not for him) and casual and not a couple. We both agreed on that. And I'm fine with it and want it to work. Travelling with him, sleeping with him is just really fun and I don't want to overthink it. I want to enjoy it while it lasts. But I do have the tendency to overanalyse and worry.   But prior to the Talk, with the meeting with his friends (there was this week were we car tripped around the country sleeping at different his friends' houses every night and meeting friends who had wives and children and me getting introduced as a new Aunty) things got confusing. And I find myself falling into realtionship patterns in terms of expecting certain behaviours and considerations on his side. I need that to stop.   He's been a lot better at setting and keeping boundaries since the Talk. I still need to get out of the mindset of wanting to update him about my day and wanting to hear about his etc... And feeling ignored if I don't hear from him for an entire day! (gasp)   I guess I'm venting. I want this arrangement to work, I just have no idea how deal with something like this.   To be clear, I have no expectations of this developing into a serious relationship. However, I'm interested in keeping him and some of the people I've met through him as friends even after our arrangement ends."
AskTrollX,3cfpgi,TheInfanta,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"What you're doing isn't a traditional FWB. I saw somewhere else on reddit what you're in being called a mingle. A mingle is apparently where you treat each other like you're significant others but there are no long term plans or commitments. Like if someone you cared more about came along, neither of you would be hurt if you ended things.  I recently went through something similar but we went from a traditional FWB (just sex and some really nice conversations), to going on dates, cuddling for hours, and meeting friends.  I ended up having a bunch of the same problems you did, wanting to talk to him all the time, tell him about my day, confide in him. Which had never happened with previous FWBs. It was frustrating until I had friends point out that  I was essentially his girlfriend but I couldn't complain about our situation because we weren't ""committed."" I ended things because it was making me so unhappy, and I didn't think we could roll back to what we were before. But, we had been seeing each other closer to a year.   I think you might need to put more boundaries up if you want this to continue. Like the language he uses to describe who you are to his friends. No more ""Aunty."" Have you gone on dates with other people? If so, what was that like?"
AskTrollX,3cfpgi,sarasmirks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! And that figures.   I think where things went off was that we were natural friends, then had sex and he decided to try and treat me like a girlfriend in the hopes that romantic feelings would arise.   When that didn't happen we had the conversation about being FWB and casual.   But, by that time we'd already been established as a couple in front of his friends and even though I can honestly say I'm not in feelings with him, in that period I got used to him wanting to know about my day and sharing his etc. Because before defining our relationship, we were acting coupley.   That went away after the Talk. It's both easier and weirder now.  In the time we were going on friend dates and not sleeping together, I was also dating someone else but I wasn't sleeping with him. I stopped after the first time we slept together.   I know that he was having sex with someone at that time too, but he also stopped after we had slept together.   So for about a month we were exclusive and went through all the motions of a new relationship including keeping up to date about our days and meeting friends etc. Then we both decided that despite liking each other as people and sexual compatibility, we were not interested in each other romantically.   It seems easier on him than me. I've since reactivated my Tinder account and haven't gone on dates but am talking to a couple of people, but at the same time I want to talk to him all the time. :/ He doesn't seem to have that issue. But on the other hand, he's not actively looking for someone else, he hasn't got back on Tinder and I'm pretty certain he's really happy with our situation.   And I don't want to make this even messier by demanding more attention when what I should be doing is enjoying the whenever I want it sex and the choice of still looking for that guy who makes me feel butterflies."

I've been telling myself for a year that obviously I don't have feelings for this dude, and I know it's never going to go anywhere, and this is just for getting laid while I'm too busy to meet other people. But you know what? I'm kind of lying to myself. Because when I found out my FWB is not only seeing other people, but blowing off the chance to see me in favor of seeing other people, it SUCKED.  I don't know that I would tell you to never ever do the fuckbuddy thing. But I would say, don't do it for too long, don't get emotionally involved, and be honest with yourself about your feelings. You get to feel happy and fulfilled and loved. You deserve that. And, eventually, there's a strong chance that FWB is going to make you feel like crap."
AskTrollX,3ce7ri,lovekeepsherintheair,6,Tue Jul 7 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"Wall of text/ramble ahead. I just want some insight or advice from fellow trolls.    In group therapy today I mentioned that I have a real problem with ""out of sight, out of mind."" I was talking about how I felt minor guilt about not calling my family more often but since they live so far away, it takes more effort to keep in touch and it's easier for me to just not think of them at all most of the time.    This got me thinking of how I have a similar approach to my body, diet, and health. I am significantly overweight and I know I need to take action to change that. But it is so easy not to, and it's hard to find the motivation to make any changes in my life. A, I have a partner who loves me and my body exactly as they are, and B, I love food and currently eat ice cream and pizza multiple times a week. Who would want to change the good thing I've got going?    To make things more difficult, I struggle with depression and disordered eating. I can only successfully count calories for a few days before it devolves into binge/starve cycles. I've tried the food exchange system with some success, but it's still a matter of finding the motivation to stick with it.    Does anyone have any advice for finding the motivation when you don't have it within yourself? Anybody empathise with my struggles?"
AskTrollX,3ce7ri,bandaidtanlines,4,Tue Jul 7 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"So these are things I relate to a lot, but feel like I mostly have figured out (don't worry, I suck at other things really hard--I'm not perfect) so maybe I can be of a little help.  I totally get the ""out of sight, out of mind"" thing. The avoidance of things...sometimes things that aren't even hard and will benefit you. I do it often. Try making to-do lists? I find that the more time and effort I put into the lists, the better I do. Make it pretty, hang it on the wall where you are forced to see it until it's complete. Also  try doing things that will make you accountable? Like text your mom/dad/whoever and say ""hey, I'm going to call you this evening. Will you be available?"" that way, you're more likely to follow through and also not feel like you're a bother because they're expecting you.   There's nothing wrong with ice cream and pizza. It's all about moderation. I'm not stick thin, but I'm not overweight, and I still eat lots of shit. It does take work, though. It's not always easy, but I think it's worth it. I use Myfitpal to keep track of what I'm eating, because with the ""out of sight, out of mind"" type of thought patterns, it's so easy to not realize exactly what's going in. Not every day, but enough to feel in control of my eating habits. They say that eating a certain way for 21 days will train your body (it can be untrained easily tho too), and I think it's true. I will be super religious about my calories for a few weeks, and then I find that I simply cannot eat much more than that even when give myself a break or cheat days. It's all about creating habits, and training your body/yourself. Another thing I do is when I want to eat something I know I shouldn't have, I just tell myself I can have it tomorrow. Then I can tailor tomorrow's food around my indulgence. Then when tomorrow rolls around, try to put the food off even for another day. Sometimes I end up not even wanting it. Start procrastinating food like you procrastinate talking to your family. It's one of my best tools with keeping a healthy weight. Also, I replace meals with huge servings of veggies often (full feeling + tons of fiber = amazing for weight loss), and don't drink sugary drinks unless I'm drinking alcohol (which I limit to once or twice a week at most). Walks are great, too. Try to work them into your every day or every other day routine. They aren't super strenuous or make you need a shower, and they will definitely help with burning calories AND there is science behind walks making you happier. I especially like walks with a SO. It's sort of romantic, but simple. Like on a nice summer evening through a pretty neighborhood with pretty houses.   I know everyone's different, but hopefully at least some of that helps a little, right? Good luck to you :)"

I'm overweight as well, and are currently in the process of making a seriously investment into my health - weight loss being a part of that. I absolutely understand where you're coming from. I've struggled a lot with keeping motivated, and have a history of binge eating as well.  One of the things that i find really helpful in keeping my motivation going is watching or reading stuff that reinforces the values of my healthy lifestyle. Eg. I'm into a plant based whole foods-philosphy, and there's a lot of good stuff on youtube for that (there's also a bunch of crap, but that the internet for you.).  For me, watching those videos or reading blogs helps to remind myself that I actually want to stick with this and it perpetuates my reasons and values for doing so.    My two go-to youtubers are Dani Spires and especially her ""food for thought""-series. She deals with the more mental, motivational and emotonal side of lifestyle changes in that series, and it's been helpful to me.   And second Laura Miller and her show ""Raw. Vegan. Not gross.""  not because everything/everyone should be raw or vegan, but because she's really enthusiastic about delicious, healthy food, and I find a lot inspiration and motivation in that.   Obviously these are just people and videos that resonates with me.  You might have a completely different view on health and food that someone else is making videos about. Either way, for me Youtube really keeps me on track when my motivation gets weak.

AskTrollX,3ce1j7,lunatic_minge,28,Tue Jul 7 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Ex mail-carrier here. The other posts are right, just put it in the box and write no longer at the address or whatever. Just be patient, and expect to have to keep doing it for a bit and see slip-ups every now and then.   If the letters are really bothering you, like being a trigger and whatnot, take them into the post office and tell the clerks. Things get taken more seriously when people come in and usually goes through the supervisor before the carrier so it's more likely to be taken care of quickly. Carriers are rushed on the streets and not always well-trained on paperworkey stuff, especially the substitutes.   EDIT: After re-reading the other posts, I have to add that blacking out the address isn't effective at all, and makes it hard for the carrier to know where it came from once they're back at the office and sorting mail/doing paperwork. As stated before, time on the streets is rushed so they make piles to sort through at the office where they have allotted time. The machines will still be able to read the address if you black it out. It's some serious voodoo. Writing ""RTS"" or ""not here"" or whatever is really all you need to do and should be doing.   Also, this is unrelated to this, but have to say it...blacking out barcodes is seriously rude. I get that you don't want the package, but making the carrier's job hard with returning it is not cool. /rant"

AskTrollX,3ce1j7,raziphel,4,Tue Jul 7 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is wrong. THE MACHINES READ THROUGH IT and the machine doesn't need those barcodes if it has the address anyway, and carriers don't ever use these barcodes so there is zero point to this. Generally when a letter is put in the RTS pile by the carrier, it will get returned to sender. Occasionally, the machine makes a mistake and sends it to the original address and then it's on the carrier to make sure it isn't re delivered. If it has writing on it indicating it was misdelivered, and the carrier is paying attention and has half a brain then it will not get rededelivered."

Do you ever get the feeling in the middle of hanging out with your friends (who you love dearly), that you've never really hung out with people like yourself?  Honestly, that feeling never really goes away.    I genuinely thought I would never find that one person I wanted to hang out with, but I've found him now.  We both have weird hobbies, some that make people uncomfortable or judgey when we tell them about them (eg, mondo films, role playing games).  I'm not going to promise you that you'll find the one sometime soon.  Or that you'll have really close friends sometime soon.  I could tell you to look up groups that have your interest in town, and show up to a meeting sometime, but I know you probably won't.  There's a few groups I've wanted to join in the past, but I've been too shy to just show up.  All this aside, I've been in your position before, and this is a good chance to see if there may be some small changes you should make.  Is it possible you're a little too loud?  Is there any chance people find you intimidating?  Are you able to hold a conversation with people that doesn't involve your interests, but might involve more general knowledge?  Do you ask people questions about themselves and then genuinely listen to what they have to say?  These are all shifts I've had to make in my attitude, and I'm glad I have.

AskTrollX,3cehwc,squeakyrobot,3,Tue Jul 7 13:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hi there, fellow ADDer :)  I always embarrassed my friends because I was loud and weird and easily distracted and awkward.  They liked me, but they liked the ""normal"" parts of me.  So I tried to tone it down, which meant mainly listening to everyone else because I really did like these people and wanted to be there (but I was too uncomfortable, since I knew they didn't like my weirdness).  I thought that's how it would always be.  I accepted it.  Then I made a friend.  Over time, I got comfortable, and my weirdness came out.  I stopped caring so much about whether I sounded weird.  You know what happened?  He called me weird.  And he told me it's a good thing.  He said it's not an insult, my weirdness is what makes me fun and interesting.  And he didn't disappear on me.  I annoy him sometimes, but he annoys me sometimes.  We enjoy each other's company.  That helped me become comfortable in my own skin - knowing someone saw my weirdness and liked me anyway because of it.    I'm dating a guy now who is also weird and loud.  Well, I'm louder, but he's equally weird.  I love how weird he is.  He loves how weird I am.  We spend a lot of time laughing together (and at ourselves!).  We have some shared interests, and we have separate interests.  But our personalities being similar is really what makes it work.  You're probably not too weird.  You're probably just not meeting the right people.  Have you tried going to groups where people are interested in the same things as you?  (You might not find someone who likes getting holes poked in them and aquatic creatures and Japanese stuff... but you might find someone who has a passion for one of those and will happily listen to you talk about your other hobbies if you'll also chat about what they like.)

Would definitely recommend, its about a girl fascinated by jellyfish.   I don't think you're too weird. Sometimes it's tough, as a person with similarly weird hobbies. There's nothing quite like excitedly ranting about water chemistry in your tank and seeing their eyes glaze over...  you will meet your people!   Sometimes it's a case of figuring out if you're breaking any conversation ""rules"". I tend to get excited and coming off too strong, so it's a case of me keeping this in mind when meeting new people. Even then, some people are generally more/less tolerant of social oddness. Where I used to live, I got used to filtering what I said to strangers lest you get THAT look, but in my new town I can say whatever I think and people don't blink twice."

I also know a lot of useless animal facts that nobody finds fascinating except for me! I'm also shy until I get to know people and have a lot of ADD traits (No formal diagnosis)   YOU CALLING ME WEIRD BRO?!   None of my friends like fish. A couple of them are into anime.. none of them are heavily tattooed or pierced. My boyfriend included, although I have swayed him onto japanese food. .. the important thing to remember is that when you're looking for a partner you're NOT looking for another you.  My boyfriend studied art at university,  he's in a band, likes to work out and loves star trek.  I've never been able to study, have low self confidence, can't bring myself to lift weights and all the sci-fi talk in star trek makes me feel like my brain is bleeding. He writes, hundreds of pages, where I can't even write the first line of a CV. We are pretty opposite in terms of those things, but we share the same life views and the same values. I appreciate his interests, I know it makes him happy, and I enjoy learning different things from him and he does from me.  Just relax and carry on being yourself. It probably sounds cliche to say ""the right person will come along when you're not looking""  but a lot of the time it turns out true!  I should shut up."

It's pretty sad, but you gotta do what you gotta do to pay the bills sometimes. So I would wistfully pass up the double and triple-ply quilted, cushiony, bougie toilet paper because my bank account does not allow me to live that life. ALAS trolls, I discovered a coupon and a store sale that were able to be double stacked so I bought a couple of those mega cases of Charmin with extra fluffybutt.   I've noticed though that every time I get in the shower I have to scrape out dozens of little paper pills from my buttcrack. I really don't imagine this to be a desirable ""asset"" but now I have ten thousand rolls so I am going to have to use them. Is this how the other half lives?

AskTrollX,3cbe6v,Storyintheend94,26,Mon Jul 6 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"I actually have one of these.   So in short I got out of a 5 year relationship and told myself I was going to be single and just date for fun, then comes in this dude, who we shall call T, it started off as a FWB type thing then we both started liking each other more and more. Well as time passed he started getting strange we never labeled our relationship and it was pretty much like boyfriend and girlfriend, we had a ton of fun and he showed me a lot of new stuff. Then I got blindsided one day by him saying he wanted to keep dating me but he also wanted to date other people. I was torn and he told me he had been dating other people the entire time but didn't want me to know. He SOMEHOW convinced me that he just need a little time to figure out what he wanted to do but he was sure he wanted to be with me just not right now. then he started to ditch me for his ""friends"", have me wait up really late for him to be ""ready"" to hang out (I'm talking like supposed to meet at 6 and not meet until 9-10) or would invite me out and flirt with other girls in front of me, he also would lie to me then flip the situation to say that I was the one who lied or exaggerated so I was the bad guy. Well this went on for a year pretty much and every time he did that and hurt me he would some how convince me to stay and said he wanted me more than the other girls (obviously I was an idiot) Finally after about a year of him leading me on and convincing me to stay he made a massive mistake of inviting me to a party he was throwing at his house and told me an hour before the party that I shouldn't kiss or touch him romantically because a girl he was also seeing and really liked was coming and he didn't want to mess things up with her. That was literally my last straw.   I flipped my shit because I finally realized he was just wasting my time and I wasn't ever going to actually be with him. That day I told him to eff off and he begged for us to be ""just friends"" because he couldn't stand the idea of losing me in his life, that lasted about 2 weeks because I met my current BF and I realized how toxic T was, he made me constantly sad or would get my hopes up, I was constantly heartbroken because I loved him and he didn't give two shits.  So I ended up going on a date that following Tuesday with a guy I met on Tinder, and we had a blast. It lead to another date that week and we've been together ever since. He treats me so well and has the most patience and kindness I have ever experienced. He is loving and devoted, he surprised me with little things I love and even when he looks at me I see that he loves me. Within the first month of us dating he bought us ticket to see the Zelda Symphony because I had mentioned it in passing that I wish I could see it, even though he's NEVER played it (I'm currently making him play skyward sword). He also tells me how lucky he is to have me and how he couldn't be happier and that he loves me more than anything. It's amazing. I have never felt so content or spoiled (in my own silly way aka no pants and video games with pizza together) in my entire life."

The problem was, we got older but our relationship never did. It was stuck in preteen hell. I was controlling and jealous, he was abusive and manipulative. He was emotionally abusive and would tell me things like I was lucky to have him, no one else would love me, blah blah blah blah. I would call his friends to find out if he was telling me the truth, I would create fake Friendster (who remembers that shit?!) accounts to see if he would cheat on me... God it was awful. But we got engaged. Bc that is what elementary sweethearts are supposed to do, right? By the end we were more in love with the idea of our story than actually being in love. While I recognized it first, he brow beat me into staying with him (""you say you love me but you won't even give us a chance!"" He just wanted to be the one to break up with me, not the other way around). It would be another three months of both of us emotionally manipulating and abusing the other before it was finally over, I was 21/22 (I can't remember now it's been almost a decade), in grad school, and felt totally lost.  In college, I met my husband. While there was an instant attraction, I was with someone else. Well. Here it is, 5 years later. My future husband and I went on a group trip  with friends. He and I ended up hanging out the whole time. We laughed. We joked. We hooked up. And while I never meant for it to be more, he was just so sweet. So kind and funny and we got along. I thought to myself, well he isn't your type, but your type hasn't worked out for you, so give him a try. I told him I wanted to see him when we got back home, after the trip, and he admitted he felt the same way. We just celebrated 7 years of marriage and will be celebrating 10 years together at the end of this year."

Low self-esteem definitely played a part, and it was more complicated than just that. However, I was definitely more in love with the idea of being in love and being needed than with him.   This comment just jogged my memory about something minor, but not really minor, if you know what I mean.  The story we used to tell about how we met was completely glossed over and changed to sound much better than it actually was.  The truth is that we met in a bar (introduced by a coworker ), drank, and made out against my car on a dirty city street around midnight.  I was rebounding, he was an unemployed loser with no car crashing on an acquaintances couch.   We just kinda fell into a relationship, and I was too beat down at end things until it was unbearably bad.  The entire relationship was me deluding myself and ignoring things that were obvious red flags and should have been huge deal-breakers.   I am sooo glad I got out of there, although I do wish I had done it much sooner. Everything led me to where I am now, though, happily married to a wonderful man who is everything I could ever want."

Well we were technically broken up, but trying to work things out when the concert came around. He didn't want to go because we were fighting and it was more of my thing, so I took a girl friend.I ended up meeting the coolest guy at the concert who made me see that my ex was a complete dipshit. Like not only that the ex was an ass, but also that he was so basic and lame because the new guy oozed coolness out of every orifice. I went from being a sad wreck to being like ""bye bitch"" so fast. We ended up forming a very strong friendship and dated on and off for a few years. Not in a dramatic way, we have never fought because we truly respect and care for each other which is why we didn't feel the need to own one another. We're not together because he is a touring musician and I want him to live his dream, and I want someone more stable and present. We're still good friends.

At 26, I finally put an end to my final, toxic ""relationship"" with an arrogant, pitiful ass. No longer would I stand to be taken for rides and used up until there was nothing left of me but a vodka soaked corpse. A week later, I walked into a bar after a terrible wedding and met my Poops.

I was miserable and cried all the time. He wrote me letters all the time, and it was sweet, but it didn't last when he got out of basic.

Like 2 or 3 days later we went to a friends house to get drunk and swim and he was in the pool and his foot got caught on the volleyball pool net and someone goes ""oh didn't that happen to you on july 4th too?!""

So they're both stories about me liking someone for years before actually getting together with them, but with incredibly different results.  I met P when I was around 13 or 14 years old. We went to the same church, and he was the biggest flirt I had ever met. All of the girls in our group were interested in him, so I just assumed that he wasn't interested in me since he treated us all relatively the same. We kept in touch off and on throughout the years, and then when I was 22 I found out that he was single. He started hanging out with my best friend a lot, which led to all of us hanging out in a group. He was still a huge flirt, but this time around it was more focused on me instead of everyone. We wind up getting together, and it's exactly what I thought it would be. We have a lot of fun for about six months, then I start freaking out about graduating from college and having anxiety attacks pretty regularly. He made me feel like I was unstable and crazy instead of being supportive. I don't think it was intentional, really, but he just didn't understand what it was like. Eventually I just started rejecting my emotions if they were unpleasant and assumed that there was something wrong with me and tried to ignore it. We get progressively unhappier for about two years before I finally call it off. I called it off because we were both unhappy, but the final straw was that...   I reconnected with my current SO, A. I had met A when I was 21 and single for the first time in a while. He was incredibly charming, sarcastic, and witty, and tragically dating someone else. He and I were friends for about 6 months before I finally realized that I was seriously falling for him and distanced myself so that things wouldn't get complicated or dramatic. Then I started dating P, and that lasted a little over two years. Towards the end of my relationship with P, I ran into A at a party thrown by mutual friends. I find out that he was single for the first time in years, and we start talking. I took about a month to evaluate my relationship with P, and I realized that I had no interest in continuing things. We broke up, and I pretty much immediately started hooking up with A. We tried to keep things label free/quasi casual, but we wound up moving in together after about a month of dating. We've been together ever since then (it'll be three years in a couple of weeks), and I seriously couldn't be happier. He's incredibly supportive in ways that I never realized I needed, and it's the most connected I've ever been to anyone."

AskTrollX,3cbe6v,kmm91,6,Mon Jul 6 22:24:48 2015 UTC,"Story time...    I met a guy who seemed charming and just down on his luck. I helped him get himself in order, ""loaned"" him money to get a car, co-signed on a loan because his credit sucked, and spent all of my energy making sure he had what he needed. I didn't even consider my needs, or what I was getting in return. Love should be unconditional, right? (Hint: wrong, a relationship should add to your life in a positive way).   He moved in after a year because he was house and dog sitting for me while I was away on a cruise for a week and a half, and he never went home. There was a brief, ""we could save some money by living together"" chat, and that was it.  Less than a year later he proposed. I said yes and didn't think not to, even though there were already problems. There were soooo many red flags, but I wanted to keep up appearances of being happy, I had poor self-esteem, and I went along.   I didn't want a big wedding, but he did and my family did, so I went along. Of course I did the majority of the planning, and paid for the entire thing with my money (because he was a deadbeat that barely made anything and couldn't save for shit).   Six months later I found out he was cheating on me. While denying me sex, constantly watching porn, and claiming to just be stressed and tired (oh, did I mention he was 20 years older than me?)  But we were married, and I did the entire ""promise to be together forever"" thing in front of everyone I cared about.   I kept mostly quiet about all of the horrible problems (effectively cutting myself off from my support network at his request), but demanded we go into counseling.  Two years later, after more therapy (individual and couples) than I care to think about, I stumbled on a hornets nest of lies. Almost everything he had told me was untrue.  The extent and ridiculousness of the lies aren't even worth going into.   Thankfully there were no kids, so the divorce should only have taken six months. Instead, he dragged his feet, and I had to fight just to get him to sign the papers. It was an uncontested, no fault divorce, but of course I paid for everything (again) as the only one responsible enough to hire a lawyer.   When that was finally done the courthouse lost the paperwork (during that time one judge retired and the two clerks who processed paperwork left). Not even kidding. I had to do the whole thing again, and wait for the now singular judge in the county who handled divorce to make it through the backlog on his desk.   After a year of separation I started dating again. Some comically unsuccessful dates and a doomed-from-the-start short term thing with a semi-coworker who lived out of state made me decide to disable my dating account. On a whim one night when I was out with friends I reactivated just to compare awful messages.   A handsome man caught my eye. He was at the very top of my list, and a 96% match. His profile was witty, humorous, intelligent, and well-thought-out. I gave him five stars, then crashed at my friend's house.   The next morning I had a message from him. We chatted back and forth a little, then settled on dinner that night. We really connected. I was walking on clouds when he kissed me goodnight.   He cancelled a scheduled date with someone else so we could go out again the following Friday. We spent the entire weekend together, and virtually every one after.   I just married him May 29th. I couldn't be happier. This is the everything a relationship should be. We are right for each other in deeper ways than I could imagine possible. This is the healthiest, sexiest, most loving, fun, balanced relationship I've been in by far.   I think the mistakes I made, the learning I did, and especially the years of therapy helped me understand what I need in a partner. It helped me develop healthy self-esteem and not just fall into a relationship with the first person who showed interest. I chose someone better because I knew better, and I could attract better by being more of a well-rounded, confident person."

Go on yelp or get a recommendation and find a really good person who is sanitary & has a good ""bedside manner."" I always do hard wax because it is the best for sensitive skin, and use aloe vera afterwards to reduce redness/pain/itching. It doesn't hurt nearly as much as you think it will, especially if you go to a good esthetician who knows what they're doing.

I was torn between trying the shaving methods over at /r/ladyshavers or getting waxed.  But I research everything to death before I try it and waxing seemed an easier place to start. Yelped a few nearby places and bit the bullet and made an appointment at a spa.  Yes, it hurts. And yes, it's expensive ($70 for where I go, tip not included).  But it's over in 15 minutes and then I don't have to think about it for another 5-6 weeks. Plus now my hair grows in slower, thinner, and softer. I may finally be at peace with my pubes. Well...as at peace as I can be when I still pay to have them forcibly ripped out every month or so.

Some really important thing when it comes to shaving.  1.everyone is different and hairs come in different coarseness and skin different levels of sensitivity. Some people use a cheap dollar store 30 pack of razors until it rusts without any issues because they have this annoying combination of baby hairs and skin of steel. Me even with technique I need at least a buffer of a day or two if I shave to smoothness. Me my beard hairs are like steel wire and my face is sensitive. So yay.  2.The most important way to step up your shaving game is proper lubrication. A good shaving soap or gel or oil will do wonders to improve your quality of shave no matter what you use.   3.dont be cheap about using and replacing razors. Dull blades cause irritation, cuts, and etc. You can save and get a sharp blade you can throw out often by switching to double edge safety razors. There's more of a learning curve with them but many people experience less razor burn and irritation with them.   4.Technique matters. Modern multi razors are a little moe forging so you don't have to worry about technique as much. You might still find yourself cut and irritated though. Remember use proper soap or quality cream. Trim with scissors or a trimmer first if it's too long. Once the proper length go with the grain first and then if you want go against the grain after its nice and short you may to get close but be careful. As always don't apply to much pressure either and let the sharpness of the blade take care of the hair.   All that said, it's a pain in the ass to shave. If you don't want to look too wild in your pants, you should just follow the rules of the professional beard. Keep it trim and neat looking and shaped up and you can have hair while still looking neat an professional."

Shave ""with"" the hair, not against. When you shave your legs, you pull up toward your face. When shaving the lady bits, shave toward your feet. Use a non-scented soap, not a shaving cream. Shaving cream may irritate your skin.  When you're done shaving, air dry completely, then use coconut oil to lightly moisturize the skin.

Also she wanted me to quit playing rugby because the girl I cheated with is on my team. Initially I was being selfish and said no but then after a lot of arguing I agreed to quit because I wanted to be with her. Also her biggest request of the relationship was honesty and I broke her trust more than once but I know now I was being stupid and am ready to commit (too little too late, I know).  Anyways I had cheated and then lied about it for months then finally came clean. We fought and broke up but then got back together. I thought we were going to be able to work it out and stay together and everything seemed fine but then unexpectedly she broke up with me saying she couldn’t get over it but promised to stay friends. After the breakup I desperately tried to get her to take me back but she wasn’t having any of my bullshit. I saw her about a week after and it was awkward at first but then she told me she needed some time which gave me hope (she is also going through a lot right now so I understood). Then the next week she told me she didn’t love me anymore and had already moved on which left me heartbroken for a second time. Then she told me I was being too pushy and needed to back off basically (I was being pushy but I still love her). I asked her after we broke up to tell me if she started dating anyone new because I think it would help me move on. I’m pretty sure she is seeing someone new but when I ask she gets very upset and won’t answer. Also despite her constant promises to stay friends she doesn’t text me ever and when I want to talk to her she says she doesn’t want to talk to me.  Honestly trolls, I never thought I would become the crazy ex gf but that’s exactly what I’m being. I’m really trying to move on but I feel so lonely and I’m afraid of being without her when the semester begins. I can’t eat or study without bursting into tears and when I finally slept an entire night I had a dream about her.  I’ve hurt her so much but I want to fix my mistakes and show her how much she means to me. At the same time by doing so I’m actually harassing her.  I don’t want to be the crazy ex, but I can’t bear losing my girlfriend AND my best friend. What should I do? All my friends and family have told me to move on but I’m having a really hard time not thinking about her. (Throw away username because she knows my real one)"

AskTrollX,3c8unn,P_Grammicus,31,Mon Jul 6 00:10:29 2015 UTC,Because she's confused. She still feels a bond with you but her trust in you has been severely betrayed. Do the stand up thing and give her her space.
AskTrollX,3c8unn,helianto,25,Mon Jul 6 00:16:56 2015 UTC,"Because she doesn't want any more drama. She's done. She has told you this, you're just not accepting it. Things cannot go back to where you'd like them to be, trying to make it so is where the crazy stuff starts happening. That sucks for you, but it's the way things are, and it seems like you'd really like to maintain a cordial relationship (if nothing else) so accepting the situation is the first thing you need to do.   When someone says they still want to be friends, that's not something that can happen instantly. What it means is that they want to stay civil, and maybe, once things are calmed down and the two of you can approach a relationship without things being weird, then, maybe, a friendship can be constructed. But thinking that one can go from lovers to friends overnight is a good way to torture yourself, her, and to ultimately sabotage any good feelings left.   You're acting like kind of a shitty friend right now, you're demanding time when she's not able or willing to give it to you, you have ulterior motives in that you'd like to reconcile and she doesn't, and you're demanding personal information about her that's none of your business whatsoever. None of that is what a best friend does to another, that's the sort of creepy bullshit people who bitch about being in the friend zone do, and I assume you don't want to end up like that.   I know it's hard, and you probably feel like you're going to die right now. But your friends and your family are right, you do need to leave this alone if you actually want to have anything positive come out of it. Keep busy, stay active, and leave her alone, take care of yourself better than you are right now.  This is a hard thing to do, but it's the kindest, for her, and especially for your own well being right now."

You will be happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best ways.  Like everything, there will be good days and bad days, but there are things you can do to make the good days better and more frequent. Get steady employment, and preferably steady employment that pays well. Though, you can make it on $24K a year. It won't be great but it's doable and you can actually live pretty happily.   Find a good place to live. By good I mean, you have quiet neighbors, you're in a safe neighborhood, your accommodations are in good repair, your roommates (if you have them) are considerate and your rent is affordable. Tour lots of apartments if you're renting. Always get price comparisons. Also look for places where your electric, heat, water, or sewer is included in your rental.  Coupons. Coupons are your friends. I've saved north of $20 bucks at grocery stores with them and I'm not even one of those extreme coupon-er people. They really help with getting extra room in your food budget. Speaking of food, subscribe to /r/Eatcheapandhealthy. There are a lot of fun ideas in that subreddit that won't break your bank.  Budget for gas, insurance, car payments, your cell phone, internet, cable (I ditched cable and used my dad's Netflix account), electric, groceries, and student loans, if you have them. Try and save a little each month. It really helps when your tire blows on you unexpectedly and you need a replacement, or you have to go to the ER for an injury.   If you can do all that, you are going to have way more good days than bad days. Getting all of that together starts out stressful at first, but when you get yourself established in your new place and a good routine for buying groceries and paying bills, you'll start feeling a lot more confident in yourself and your abilities to do this whole adult-ing thing.

I didn't fuck it up and I graduated with great grades and a great job. I'm stressed now too, but it's a different kind of stress and a better kind of stress. I stress about my workload but I love the work. I stress about bills and food and adult things. But I find that all of the things that I stress about are in my control: I can't deal with my workload? Fine, ask for help. I'm struggling with bills? No worries, just re-budget. I'm scared of the dentist and stressed about having to go? Lady up and just do it. I love that my adult stresses are things that are more or less within my control.  Of course I haven't had to deal with the major life stresses of sickness and death within my friends and family yet. Those stresses will, I'm sure, eclipse anything that I've felt thus far. But as for the stresses that I've felt between school and adulthood, I will take the adult stresses any day of the week."

I have a degree in a social science and it was in 2011, so not deep into the recession, but still a part of the very sluggish growth period.  If I wasn't able to live with my dad, there was no way I would've gotten to the point where I am now. I took a retail job, which eventually was low-paying call center work, and worked my way up to higher paying call center job to where I am nows in a front-facing customer service job and living on my own.  I had a ton of student loan debt that a large amount was paid off by my dad selling our house  (neither of my parents went to college so they didn't think it was a big deal that I didn't have savings for it, lololol.)  I never was more stressed than the first year or two after college. If I could do it all again, I'd probably not pick the degree I graduated with."

AskTrollX,3c6elp,Theskyishigh,8,Sun Jul 5 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"when you have a steady income and fairly decent roof over your head, you should be able to enjoy your twenties. i remember it as fairly stress free outside of work. You may need to put some longer hours in for a few years if you are career driven but if you don't have any dependents, your time is your own once you clock off. Decide what type of life you want for the next few years and split your budget accordingly. For me, i wanted cheap food, clothes and housewares and money for trips abroad once a year. Save even a little as soon as you get a job, to get into the habit. Then enjoy youself."
AskTrollX,3c6elp,kochipoik,2,Sun Jul 5 08:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say there's less stress in general, particularly if you're relatively good with money (like I wasn't)"
AskTrollX,3c6elp,Sigh_No_More,2,Sun Jul 5 09:48:04 2015 UTC,"It depends on your situation, honestly. I have very cheap rent and a decent paying job that I never have to think about outside of work. My stress at home is practically non-existent, and when it does happen, it's usually because of something out of the ordinary, like a sick pet or an interview or having to set up new health insurance or something.  I really enjoy being out of college, but I'm also in kind of the ideal situation. The worst part is not living across the hall from all of my friends. We still live in the same city, but we don't hang out nearly as much as we did in college."
AskTrollX,3c6elp,meerbles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"It's a different kind of stress. Deadlines are different, now they're projects at work as opposed to homework for school. You can always find something new to stress out about. It gets a little bit better when you realize that everyone around you similarly has no idea what they're really doing and is also flying by the seat of their pants. :)"

For me, the transitional periods are always the most stressful, but things even out and become enjoyable. I lived on campus all four years, so it was a big change to have my own place, pay utilities, etc. There's a lot more freedom with how you want to spend your free time, but I had to make much more of an effort to socialize because it was no longer a given that people my age were just going to be around all the time.  I think your experience also will depend on what field you're going into. Are you going to grad school/pursuing more education? Do you anticipate having a job lined up right away? Additionally, where you end up living will have a big effect. I'm in a city where there are tons of activities going on all the time, many of them free or inexpensive.

AskTrollX,3c6elp,Lanilegend,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"I would say its stressful in a different way and it really depends on if you are good at time management and money management. I think I've had a much more fun time now compared to when I was in school. It all really depends on who you are and what you do. A job that's full time can pay great or crap so the money issue is hard to advise on. I work full time and I get weekends off and I'm done by 5pm which pretty much gives me free range to do whatever I want in those time spans, I think its a lot better because I don't go home and deal with homework anymore. I've had a lot more time for friends, but that's because I make the plans I don't just do the spur of the moment thing anymore, its a lot harder to do that. As for money it really depends on you, if your job pays you enough and you are good at saving or budgeting your fine. Plus instead of constantly going out and spending money just have people hang out with you at home, it may sound lame but I have people over all the time and we have a blast just drinking at home or hanging out and it saves a ton of money when you are buying a couple of $6 drinks at a bar. I mean I make crap pay ($11/hr in Florida) which to some might seem a lot but to put it one way our retail people make $10 an hour so I'm not really up there in the money world. BUT I still budget myself to have a bit of money each month for going out or to buy something I want. Yeah you can't go out as much and you have to watch your money but once you get used to it its not hard at all. People just make silly mistakes with their money like eating out or buying coffee at starbucks, that all adds up really quickly, I coupon and I try and cook at home as much as possible and I always have an extra $100-$200 a month I can use for emergencies or for fun. Its all about balancing yourself out and understanding sometime you have to sacrifice stuff."
AskTrollX,3c6e6m,blacklipstick24,22,Sun Jul 5 07:07:49 2015 UTC,"It can be a big help, I definitely recommend it. The one caveat is it can take some trial and error to find one who's a good fit for you. It's really discouraging to see your therapist acting bored or saying things that make you realize they don't get you at all. Therapy is hard because you're working on yourself and dealing with your feelings but it shouldn't be hard because your therapist isn't really on your side. When that happens, you just have to tell them you won't be making any more appointments. I've never had one react badly, that's good at least.  But that said, a therapist who's a good fit is hugely beneficial."
AskTrollX,3c6e6m,whyihatepink,7,Sun Jul 5 12:50:48 2015 UTC,"If a therapist did react badly to that, they could easily lose their license, depending on the severity of their reaction.  Source: am therapist."

She recomended books and workbooks (that taught me how to change my thought process and also some coping techniques). She helped me with self esteem and all sorts of things ! It;s nice jus talk to someone about stuff.  I talk to my mom about stuff too but a therapist is trained in how to respond properly
AskTrollX,3c6e6m,reddidentity,6,Sun Jul 5 07:25:12 2015 UTC,"I've done therapy on and off throughout my life. I had some big triggering events in college that compelled me to get serious and find someone who I really click with. That is the trick, it is really about finding a therapist who you trust and like both in terms of personality and therapy style. I've been working with her on a semi-regular basis for almost five years now and it is amazing. Almost like having another close friend who knows all my intimate details and keeps me on track with sticking to specific goals and behaviors. If you are even considering, I highly recommend shopping around and seeing how you feel about some of your local doctors."

If there's something off about your therapist or you just don't like them, it's okay to stop seeing them and try someone else. They know that your relationship with them is important, and they know it takes time to shop around for a therapist you like. They won't take it personally, and if they do, they're bad at their job anyway. So find someone you like.   But seriously therapy is the best. Once you get settled in, you'll really love it."

AskTrollX,3c6e6m,afuckingusername,2,Sun Jul 5 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"It depends. Are you willing to put in the emotional work and time? Do you sincerely want to change your behavior and/or thoughts? Can you afford it a.k.a. do you have insurance that will cover it?   I've been in therapy on and off for the last six years. I'm struggling with depression and intimacy issues. There have been times where I felt therapy was painful, draining, and disappointing but I truly think it saved my life. I still have a ways to go, but my most recent therapist is amazing and I really value my time with her.   The most important thing (echoed above by gmonkey42) is whether or not you get along with your therapist and can trust them. Once you build up your rapport, you should be able to confront them if they do something you don't like. If they give you advice you don't like, tell them. If they seem to look bored or annoyed while you're talking, say something. If you're holding back certain things about yourself because you're afraid they'll judge you, discuss it.  Any good therapist will welcome the constructive feedback and talk it through with you. They are there to help you!  If you have any questions about therapy, I'd be happy to answer them. :)"

Change process isn't always concious, but they will likely give you homework to practice new (coping) techinques etc.  Then I switched to a group therapy for people my age, which is based around giving insight in your thought process, behaviour and cycles you're stuck in. Because a lot of problems have underlying issues that most people recognise, it's very helpful to talk about their coping strategies, outcomes in different situations etc.   I started noticing things changing from the start, although sometimes it all seemed hopeless which is very normal. It's hard working on yourself. But you'll get there. It's a long process but it's worth so much in the end. It helped me with serious panick attacks, social anxiety and depression."

The main thing is finding someone you're comfortable with I suppose. These days I manage better with having a friend I'm close with rather than a random person I'm paying.  I recommend it to everyone really. It is something good to invest yourself in. You learn a lot from even attending a session or two.

The therapist I went to is one of the most kind, genuine people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, and that helped a lot because I knew he just wanted me to work through the shit and be happy. And eventually I was. He was the one to finally prompt me to get on medication for my depression and anxiety that I had been suffering from for over 10 years, but I had never gotten on meds because my mother would not approve/let me. After a year I felt good enough that I was able to stop taking them, and the therapy helped me identify the thoughts and attitudes that indicated that I was having a depressive episode or was being unreasonably anxious. So he helped me get on medication that helped and he helped me cope without medication.  I don't know what I would have done without him.

Something I feel like girls overlook sometimes is the type of underwear they wear. Does it spend a lot of time in your butt? I recommend sticking to panties, not thongs or the boy shorts that only cover the top half of your butt. Also a major one is the seam. A seam right down the middle is so bad for the vag. Try to find ones with the diamond sewn in the crotch or ones where the seams are along the edges if you lay them flat. Oh and sleep in loose or no panties.   Also, I know menstrual cups aren't for everyone, but they do wonders for me because tampons make my vagina dry and sad and then yeasty. You just have to be careful with keeping them clean.   If you do all these things and still have problems, I am sincerely sorry. I will pray to the vagina gods for you.   EDIT: forgot about diet and baths. Too much sugar and/or not enough water can contribute to problems. Especially water with uti's. Also baths are not a vagina's best friend. Be careful with those too.

The other thing that you may want to consider is getting re-tested for yeast/BV after you complete the treatment for it. A lot of doctors prescribe the single dose treatment for yeast infections now, but that doesn't work for every woman. I have a weak immune system for a variety of reasons and get asymptomatic yeast infections that will only completely resolve if I take the pill once a week for 3 months! (So much for their advertisements that just one dose will cure you!!) I would definitely recommend getting retested after treatment to make sure your infection has actually gone away, because one possibility is that you're not completely clearing it up but instead killing off the weakest links and letting the strongest ones survive to breed stronger and stronger buggers that will be harder to kill the next time around."

I graduate in a month and a half and then I have a month long unpaid internship.  I also have a part time job related to my field of study.  I have around $6200 in the bank right now - is that a lot of money? I have no concept of money!  Idk even how I saved that much money as a student but I think that I hoard my money.   I watched my mom go though a divorce like a year ago and she would cry when the bills for layers came because she didnt know how she was gonna pay.  Then she was unemployed for a while but now she is fine.  BUt anyway ever since then I just feel afraid of money.  I feel anxiety when I have to do things like pay a cellphone bill, when I need new jeans, when I need a hair cut, when I need a textbook etc.  I feel a lot of anxiety when I let myself buy something nice for myself that I dont really need as a treat.  I have been going out with my friends less to avoid the cost.  I bought a new sports bra and a pair of runners because I wanted to begin working out and it gave me so much anxiety - I was shaking and it was hard to breathe.

AskTrollX,3c2hzh,Dendromicon,6,Sat Jul 4 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"The amount isn't the issue, it could be £1000 in the bank, it could be £10000, the thing is how that maps to your lifestyle.  Theoretically, if disaster happened- for eg you lost your job, it could take a few months for you to find a new one. Or, you could find an interim at much lower play and you'd need to supplement from savings.  I'm 29, with a mortgage but no kids, and my husband and I make it a point to never have less than 3 months bare minimum outgoings in our savings account, just in case. That's mortgage, bills, grocery money, etc, and so for us that's ~£8000.   If I were a single student, living with my mum and paying minimum bills, I'd feel very, very secure and blessed and happy with £6000+ in savings. I think you are financially astute, but you are right to consider that this might be causing you stress and anxiety. Maybe try to remember that money isn't the be all and end all- so for example, that textbook might be £100, but the return on it in terms of education is priceless. It might also be prudent to remember that you will have a financial return on a textbook as well- a better education broadly means a better job with more ££ in the future.  Hope that helps?"

AskTrollX,3c2hzh,bluefuzzyoctopus,3,Sun Jul 5 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"My situation is a little different than yours... I am not a student, I live on my own, pay all my bills, etc. I had $5,000 sitting in the bank until recently (moved for a new job, which cost money, but new job will also make more money).   $5,000 was just barely enough for me to feel just okay. I believe that unless you have enough money to exist for 6 months without making any more, then you are in financial peril (heard that somewhere and it stuck). 6 months should be enough time to get back on your feet if something super bad happens. I could live on $1,000 a month, or a little less, if I cut back on non-essentials like Netflix, internet and avocados.   Now I need to get back to $5,000 and start saving more, so that I can buy a house or something some day soon.   The reason I am saying this is to say that, to me, $6,200 is not a crazy large amount of money to have saved.   However, the way my situation differs from yours is this: you don't have any bills right now. You don't have any rent. If your mom wants to start charging you rent, 6 months of expenses is $600. You've got that covered.   My advice to you would be to make something of a reverse budget. Most people need to create a budget so that they can save money. You need to create a budget so you can spend money. Set aside spending money each time money comes in. A very conservative amount to spend would be 50%. Every bit that comes in, you could spend/save 50/50.   Now, I HATE taking money out of my savings account. It makes me uncomfortable and itchy. If you keep all your money in one account, I can totally see spending making you a little crazy.   Put spending money in a separate account, where you know that it is expressly for spending, not for saving. Then you don't see your savings drop when you need to spend money, and you can monitor how much spending money you have. If your spending gets unusually high, and you don't need a haircut or jeans, maybe consider spending it on something fun, or something you have wanted for a while.   Anyway, that's my completely non-professional know-nothing 26 year old advice."
AskTrollX,3c2hzh,candydaze,2,Sat Jul 4 06:34:48 2015 UTC,"Based on general guidelines (i.e. Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman :P), you should have 3-9 months of expenses in an emergency fund. Sounds like you have more than enough now, but at some point in the coming months, you'll need stuff like first/last on an apartment, furniture, etc. So I don't think your savings are outrageous.   Since you're still a student, I would definitely suggest YNAB (You Need A Budget), and get it free for one year. Well, I'd suggest it anyway even if you weren't a student, but it's free as a student, so no harm, no foul. There's also a sub-reddit, /r/ynab.   That will let you allocate part of your savings for clothes, hair cuts, textbooks, future apartment deposits, furniture etc. in a very formulated way, and you can see how much you have left, etc. and hopefully that will let you breath a little. It also lets you track your spending, so you know how you're doing against what you've budgeted to a certain category."

It's really not super complicated, the hard part is building the habits. Maybe watch some of the videos and see what you think. I really do think that it will help reduce your stress when you can say with certainty ""I have 6 months of expenses, plus $500 for clothes for the next six months, and $200 a month for spending money"" etc. it's not all just in a big blob of $6k for everything.

If you do look for help, I'd definitely mention that it's one week a month.  I'd even start some kind of a mood notebook - is it a certain time during your menstrual cycle?  Does what you're eating/how you're sleeping/whether you're exercising affect it?  How were your stress levels that particular week?  (That way, you're armed with all kinds of info to help the person who might be able to help you!)     Does anyone else struggle with being happy and feeling like things matter?   Absolutely.  I mean, I've struggled with depression/anxiety most of my life.  It was pretty severe for 10+ years, but it's mild now and not really a problem most of the time.  As for not feeling like things matter... I think my issue with that is like the same kind of thing a lot of people question.  Do I matter?  If I wasn't born, would things have been different for anyone?  If I disappeared now, would it matter?  I often fall into thinking that I'm one person, I'm not doing much with my life, maybe there was someone else in the world who could've done more if they were born to my family or where I live or whatever... so I think about the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (and if you haven't seen it, it's a classic Christmas movie and I really do think everyone needs to see it but so many people hate black and white stuff nowadays!).  And I once got this in a Chinese fortune cookie (and keep it on my computer monitor to remind me): ""With every deed you are sowing a seed, though the harvest you may not see.""   I can't get excited about things like I used to. How can I change this?   You could be bored with what you're doing - if you haven't tried anything new lately, try something new.  Break the routine.  Go somewhere new, even if it's a town nearby.  Try a new hobby.  Go for a walk in a pretty place.  I think as life goes by, people stop getting so excited by things.  I think they stop noticing a lot of things.  Kids... well, think about them - everything is new, and everything is awesome.  Sometimes I just stop and think.  ""...that plane in the sky.  HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?  It's a giant chunk of metal, in the sky.  WHAT.""  (I mean, sure, there's a reason for why it works... but that doesn't matter.  People figured it out.  How amazing is that?  Not long ago, we were stuck on the ground.  I mean, we haven't even had cars all that long.)  Or I notice the animals in the yard and watch how they move and what they're doing.  Or I sit and actually look at the sunset, really look at it - the colors it makes in the sky and the water and how everything looks.  Notice the street musician that everyone walks by.  Really focus on the food you're eating and how it tastes.  I mean, if you're depressed, I'm not saying that stuff will help you.  It probably won't.  But I think the average person loses excitement for a lot of things - not because they're depressed, but because everything becomes routine and we stop paying so much attention.  I find more enjoyment in my life when I let my brain work in a slightly childish way."

I'll have to keep better track of it though like you said. I do like to journal when I feel this way, so if I look bad at the dates I can get a small sense of what was going on at the time, but I'll try to get more specific with it.  How did you deal with your anxiety/depression when it was more severe? Was it meds/therapy or changing your thinking? A combination maybe? Yeah those questions bother me a lot. I know that's more common for people to question their life, so I try to remember that when I feel that way. Maybe it's also a deep u satisfied feeling? But I guess that what being human is. I used to watch that movie every Christmas(: I forgot about it until now. That is a really good example, I'll try to remember that...  Yeah when I'm not in my funk I enjoy looking around me and thinking about how crazy this world is. Everything is so connected and we don't even know it. I love that. When I'm feeling cloudy it's harder. I know these things are a fact and that the world has a lot to offer, but I can't seem to get there. I feel disconnected. That's when it's harder.

AskTrollX,3c2t5v,messedupbutrecoverin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:54:06 2015 UTC,"How did you deal with your anxiety/depression when it was more severe? Was it meds/therapy or changing your thinking? A combination maybe?   I dealt with it by just withdrawing from the world and avoiding anything that caused me problems.  Definitely not the route I'd suggest for anyone.  And it just got better itself over time, thankfully.  I also think my depression/anxiety is mostly a result of having undiagnosed ADHD for so long - starting at a very young age, 8 or 9, I knew something was wrong with me, that I was obviously stupid even though everyone else said I was smart, and thinking that way for a long time really messes with you and ends up destroying any little bit of self confidence you might have had.  I briefly tried therapy and didn't find it helpful.  (Although it was nice to have an outsider tell me my feelings about a particular situation were understandable and I wasn't a bad person for feeling that way.)  I also tried two different antidepressants (both for a short amount of time) and an anti-anxiety pill, and neither of those were helpful for me.  I didn't have the patience to keep trying drugs.   When I'm feeling cloudy it's harder. I know these things are a fact and that the world has a lot to offer, but I can't seem to get there. I feel disconnected. That's when it's harder.   Yeah, that really does sound like textbook depression :(  I'm sorry you're going through that.  There's definitely no harm in trying to keep thinking positively - pushing away the thoughts your brain wants to come up with on it's own.  But definitely don't write off the possibility of seeing a therapist - even if just talking doesn't help, they can suggest things you can try.  If you have insurance, it's worth a shot.

You'll often see progress in non-scale ways and it helps with motivation.   Dont stare at the mirror or scale every day. You are making progress, I promise, but its slow and you wont see daily changes. Head down and power through it, it makes the times when every once in a while you'll catch your reflection in a window and go ""fuck yeah"" more satisfying.   Accept that this is a new lifestyle and it will take months or years to reach your goal. If youre putting on muscle, its not unreasonable to see only 1 pound of scale weight lost in a week, or even nothing, while you are in fact losing a pound of fat and gaining a pound of muscle. Thats GOOD. I dropped a size once while GAINING a pound.   Instead of going ""ugh gym"", deliberately think ""yay gym!"". Our brains are dumb and easy to train. If you convince yourself you like it, its easier to go.   I promise pretty much no one is looking at you. Or if they do, itll be for a second while they think ""good for her"", then they forget you the next second. Focus on yourself. Everyone else is focusing on themselves.

It's begun to take a toll on me physically, emotionally, and mentally (I've always struggled with depression, but it's at an all-time high). So, after a lot of half-assed attempts to lose weight, I've decided to join a gym and my only way to get there it to be dropped off by my mom at 7am on her way to work and to ride my bike back (exactly a mile). I might be able to ride both ways eventually, but I think I'm too overweight at the moment to ride two miles and lift weights at the gym as well.  Any suggestions for success?

AskTrollX,3c1amv,bluefuzzyoctopus,7,Fri Jul 3 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"You probably know this, but weight loss is waaaaaaaaay more easily done in the kitchen than in the gym. It takes a lot of sweat to burn 300 calories, but you can cut out 300 calories from a meal with relatively little pain. Since your questions are about gym-going rather than weight loss I'll leave it at that, but if weight loss is your #1 goal, do look into the calorie content in foods. I love working out but working out rarely makes me lose weight because my body KNOWS that working out costs energy and makes me hungrier to make up for it."

I highly recommend Starting Strength or Stronglifts as good beginner barbell programs.  Cycling while heavy can be hard, but 2 miles should be doable. Just make sure your bike is in a nice, low gear.

It's not helpful to you, and it doesn't give you any actual information about your relationship. It just makes you feel bad and encourages paranoia. I really don't think there is any correlation between how jealous you feel and how likely it is that your partner will cheat on you. Jealousy, for me, has always been much more about my own insecurities than anything actually wrong with the relationship. And you're totally right, the anxiety that comes with jealousy is tortuous, and it feeds itself.   For me, learning to refuse to give a fuck about my insecurities helped a lot. And recognizing that the way jealousy made me feel was absolutely terrible, and that anxiety hurt other areas of my life as I fixated on being jealous. shudder... it's such a difficult, unhealthy way to live.  I have a vague mental picture that I use, of me walking and jealousy being a thing in the palm of my hand that I gently drop and let fall to the ground, and walk away. I don't know if that helps?

I own just a few pairs of cute underwear and two things of lingerie, given to me for my bachelorette party. One lingerie item fits weird and one of them is way too small (the sizing on these things is ridiculous). I'm scared to buy online because of issues with sizing (e.g. I wear a size six in clothes but even 'large' panties are way too small on me). I don't know what store I won't feel terrible in. I'm working on body image issues (made huge improvements in this recently, yay!) so I feel like I'll feel awful if I spend any time in Victoria's Secret. Also, are you allowed to try on lingerie and cute underwear in stores before buying?? I don't know these things. I have small boobs, a big butt, and a broad body. I lost 100 pounds a few years ago and so not only am I still adjusting to this new body but my silly self never tried to look sexy when I was fat (thought it wasn't an option for me because of my weight, now I realize it was a confidence issue) so this is all brand new!

So I'd say put all of that (especially fit issues) aside and start from scratch. Bonus if any of it works for you, but if not, that's fine.   sexy panties generally are the same size as your regular panties, right? I mean, this is definitely not something I've had issues with, and I actually do sometimes have issues fitting underwear (I seem to be somewhere between a medium and a large at the moment, ugh).  Yes, you can try on! For the panties you will have to try on over the ones you came in, but it'll give you an idea. They're not jeans. And, again, you probably don't need to try on bottoms because in general they will be the same as what you already have. Bras, PLEASE try on, try on with abandon! Protip if you're on a budget, or even if you just already feel comfortable shopping there. Target actually has some pretty damn cute lingerie! In fact, all of my frivolous panties are from there, as I don't need to try on and also I feel less bad buying $3 lacy unmentionables than I would blowing like $50 on a pair of slightly uncomfortable underwear I only bust out on date night. What about ugrading to cute underwear in general? At this point, I do not buy underwear I don't think are cute. I do have a lot of grey cotton panties, but they are cute grey cotton panties with fun designs or lace or something. For bras, while I do have some ""practical"" ones, I will not buy unless they make my breasts look fucking flawless. If I don't feel like a sex goddess with the bra on, no sale. Some store ideas beyond Target and the dreaded VS: Gap Body! Urban Outfitters! (If you have a smallish butt; I wear a medium everywhere else but a large there, ughhhhh) Marshalls! Nordstrom Rack!

Better to be properly fitted before buying anything, rather than spend a bunch of money on stuff in the wrong size (which I've done).   As for trying stuff on, find lingerie stores with changing rooms like Ann Summers or Victoria's secret, depending on where you are, or use online retailers with free returns so you can try stuff on and get an idea of what you like.

Smoothie and salad for lunch.  Dinner is different every night. Pretty healthy usually though. Last night I had a baked potato with vegetarian chili. The night before I had turkey sandwhich. Night before that corn on the cob, cauliflower, and various fruit.   Usually have fruit for desert. Like a few rasberries or a nectarine.   This nightly nausea only started a week ago. Aside from pregnancy, it's the only thing I can figure out causes nausea but only at night.  Oh, and I drink a TON of water. I always have my water bottle with me."

I can't eat anything without taking omeprazole or my upper stomach immediately starts overreacting and causing crippling pain. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, so it stops your stomach acid glands from producing stomach acid.   My opinion: go get evaluated by a gastroenterologist. In the meantime, read up and try some OTC meds and see if anything helps."

Pizza is great, but it's got a lot of milk fat, a lot of oil, and a lot of rich dough, not to mention a ton of salt. That all needs balancing, and the vegetables that might be on top aren't enough. I have a 1:1 system with things like pizza. For every slice, I have a roughly equivalent amount of salad (green leafy vegetables with an assortment of other vegetables, no dressing).  If I'm really hungry, I might have two slices of pizza. What it ends up doing is assisting me with portion control, nutritional value, fiber, and digestion. I still get to enjoy pizza, but I don't eat a ton of it. Without that salad buffer, I could easily eat a whole pizza in one sitting and regret it later."

My first symptom was breathlessness: I'd constantly be sighing and taking deep breaths. It was distressing, and even more annoying when a doctor friend suggested I was having panic attacks. I'm happy, I have a good job, I'm married to the best fellow in the world, my family is well: I'm NOT panicking.  When the symptoms got worse, I could hardly eat anymore, my stomach hurt, I burped a lot, and I even started feeling anxious about food. Sleep was getting unpleasant. It was really sounding like reflux. I tried Pepcid AC twice a day and that resolved the symptoms. I got my hands on several boxes of Omeprazole when visiting the USA and took that for a few months, until I went to see my doctor and got a prescription. I've been taking that since, just before breakfast. It works. I'm not sure if and when I can stop though.  (I've entirely dropped coffee and switched to tea.)

It is in a lot of ""digestive aids"" because it relaxes the muscles of the digestive tract, easing cramping, but it's bad for reflux because it also relaxes the muscle at the top of the stomach that keeps acid from going up into the esophagus. Tomatoes and citrus fruit are also ones to watch out for."
AskTrollX,3bwngq,heiferly,2,Sun Jul 5 07:23:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting!

But honestly, I don't keep the best diet, so I didn't think it was anything wrong beyond my shitty diet. I carried tums around with me constantly.  Weirdly, what made me bring it up to a doctor was that I had a cough for literally a year (I'm the WORST about going to see a doctor.. the only reason I was at a doctor's office to begin with that day was that my ear was bleeding, so I went to urgent care, and I just happened to mention the coughing). It wasn't like.. cough up your lung kind of coughing.. but it was persistent. Sometimes it got so bad, I would throw up a bit. Most of the time, it was just a background kind of cough. But the biggest annoyance with it was that when I laid down to go to sleep, I'd start coughing. Every damn time. I'd wake myself up  coughing. It only got better if I propped my upper body up while sleeping, but that's uncomfortable.   Turns out, I have acid reflux. The coughing was acid splashing on my vocal chords - which was exacerbated when I was laying down.   I was on over the counter Omeprazole for a while, and it got rid of the cough almost completely and almost immediately, and I felt better throughout the day in general. After talking it over with my new GP, he gave me a prescription for Pantoprazole - which is essentially just prescription strength of the same, general thing, but much, much cheaper (like.. $7 a month versus $23 a month).   If you feel like you might have it, definitely just set yourself an appointment, and talk it over with your doc. It's super, super easily solved."

Baking soda works well to counter it temporarily, otherwise I'm chewing Tums like candy for several hours. If I watch what I eat, it doesn't get bad. Recently I've started burping a lot and having back pain when I eat, which I'm assuming is associated with esophageal/digestive problems left unchecked for too long.

I use gas-x (or a generic knock off from target/cvs) for immediate treatment and it works great.  All the pain and belly swelling is gone in less than 30 minutes.  Tums I find only help for an hour or two.  Nexium or Zantac are good for daily long term treatment.  It can cause some side effects on the other side of things so I try to limit my usage of it to one 14 day cycle every two-three months.   Foods that are high in acid (tomato sauce, red wine) and hard booze always upset my stomach.  If I drink, I always eat some toast before bed so that I have something in there to soak things up.

Or take an OTC preventative (this thread is recommending Prilosec, I take Zantac, I guess whatever works for you!).  Sometimes our bodies just do this. It's annoying but also not super serious if it is occasional.  Sipping cold milk is a nonmedical soother, as is some apple cider vinegar in a glass of water.   I actually have a acid reflux and regurgitation, which is as fun as it sounds. Going gluten free has helped me immensely, as has not over-eating.

AskTrollX,3bp25q,raziphel,7,Wed Jul 1 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"I got into a really bad depression last year and this one of my biggest issues. I had a nurse come to the house and one of the things that really helped me was simply changing the way I thought about stuff.   All I did was put myself down, pick out flaws and criticise myself. If you imagine that little voice inside your head criticising you is someone you know, would you be friends with that person? No. If you heard a friend talking about themselves like that, would you let them carry on or would you correct them? You'd correct them. Because that's what friends do. And you need to be a friend to yourself. Next time you get a critical thought change it to a statement that enables you control or confidence within yourself. Even if, it's like other people have commented on, one thing you like about yourself. Here's a better explanation of harmful thinking patterns If you learn to spot them, you can change them.  Another good way to stop comparing to others is to try and empathise with them. Really imagine what it is like to be them. Noones life is perfect, noone is completely happy with themselves and achievements and they probably have the same insecurities that you do. They are only human and are not of any more value than you are. If you use lots of social media maybe cut down on that too. Don't compare your backstage footage to other peoples highlight reel.

What matters is are YOU happy with YOUR life.   If it's not too bold, tell me what makes you compare yourself to others. Are you happy with how your life is now? Do you feel pressure to do more/better/something?"
AskTrollX,3bp25q,Retsejme,3,Wed Jul 1 09:28:41 2015 UTC,"Trolls, how can I stop comparing myself with others and get over feeling I'm not good at anything?   First, the comparing yourself to others bit. There’s some good advice in this thread already: spend less time on social media; realize that when you are on social media, you’re comparing the totality of your good/bad/mediocre experiences  to what amounts to highlight reels of other people’s lives; remember everyone else faces their own obstacles and have generally mundane daily shit to put up with just like you do; etc. All solid advice.  Personally, I used to compare myself to others all the time, and I did not come out favorable. I still struggle with it on occasion, but I’ve found ways to minimize that way of thinking. First, and this is key, remind yourself that it doesn’t fucking matter what the Hell anyone else is doing. Seriously. The “it” girl I graduated high school with and was super teen-girl-jealous of: does it really make a difference in my life whether she went to MIT or community college? Whether she’s a successful model with a gorgeous boyfriend or a struggling artist in a shitty studio? The answer is: “NO. WHATEVER THE FUCK THAT BITCH IS DOING HAS LITERALLY NO IMPACT ON MY LIFE OR SELF-WORTH. HOWEVER, GOOD FOR HER IF SHE’S DOING WELL, AND SUCKS TO SUCK IF SHE’S NOT.” Feel free to use this mantra when those mean, sneaky little comparison thoughts rear their ugly heads.  On that note, it’s SO important to get to a place where you can remove your ego from a situation, and objectively say, “Good for that person.” And it’s absolutely vital to ensure that sometimes that person is you! You’ll become so much happier and at peace with yourself, as well as others, just by quietly acknowledging and celebrating their/your accomplishments! No matter how small. Consider the following example:  I’m at the gym, I’m feeling pretty good on the elliptical in my new Asics that just-so-happen to perfectly match my shorts, rocking my favorite athletic tank (yeah, it was all totally premeditated, but still, I feel like I’m lookin’ good!), when the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen hops on the treadmill in front of me, looking effortlessly pretty, strong, and graceful running a speed I can’t hope to maintain for three minutes, let alone a half hour like she does. My first thought: “Son of a bitch! Why can’t I look like that? Why can’t I run like that? WHY NOT ME?!--IS SHE EVEN SWEATING?!” Then I slap myself in the brain, and start re-framing my thought process: “Whoa there, be cool. Don’t tear this woman down. Good for her that she’s gorgeous. She probably worked her ass off—literally—to get a body like that. She probably put in the time to get her mile time so low. And even if all of that is some natural gift from above, SO FUCKING WHAT?! None of that has anything to do with me! Her being pretty doesn’t make me less so. Her being in better shape doesn’t change the fact that I can do the shit I can—like lunges fah days and crazy sex positions in the shower! Good for her, AND good for me too!” After these mental gymnastics, I have to suppress the urge to run up to her and yell, “FUCK YEAH, YOU GO GIRL! I GO TOO! WE’RE BOTH FUCKING AWESOME!” and high-fiving her so hard she falls off the machine. It feels a lot better to suppress this urge, than attend a pity party for one. Remember: People can succeed in completely different ways. And there is no one ultimate winner at anything. Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence are both pretty. I don't give a flying fuck who's prettier or more successful. The fact is, they both pretty and both successful in different careers. End it there.  Note: LIFE IS NOT A FUCKING COMPETITION. ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A FLACCID DICKBAG AND SHOULD BE IGNORED NO MATTER HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE ABOUT THEIR MYSTERIOUS COLLECTION OF WEINERS IN A BAG. DO NOT ENGAGE.  This feeds directly into your second question, how to get over feeling that you’re not good at anything. First, who cares? Why does it matter that you be good at something, as long as you enjoy doing it? Seek out things you like to do, do them often, and you’ll naturally find yourself getting better at them.   Also equally as important, when you’re NOT good at something, don’t give up on it right away. Learn to laugh at just how terrible you are! Don’t berate yourself, appreciate your horribleness! The truth is, if you’re really bad at something, it’s probably hilarious to watch you do it. Whether your cherry cobbler came out of the oven looking like a gooey, burnt monstrosity, or you whiffed it so bad at the driving range that you literally fell over, learn to find the humor in your failure, and work on getting better. Surround yourself with people that can help you get better. Anyone who makes you feel bad for trying something new and not being immediately good at it is an asshole and a bully, and would probably find a reason to tear you down no matter what you do. So fuck ‘em.   In conclusion: Do your thing, acknowledge others' accomplishments without making them about yourself, appreciate even your most minor successes, try new things, laugh at how bad you are at them, and remember: haters gonna hate, but who the fuck cares?"

Real confidence isn't a personality trait - it comes from experience. You have to put the work in.   Achieving things takes time and effort - if it came easily, it wouldn't be an achievement. So you're going to feel like you're not good at it at first. ""Learn to enjoy failure"" is a phrase I've heard. To get good, first you have to get decent, and to get decent, first you have to get passable... etc. Best to pick something you actually enjoy, even while you're falling on your face, so that it doesn't feel like a slog the whole time.   Bonus points: you'll be so busy with your awesome new life that you won't have time to compare yourself to others."

You usually can get pregnant around day 14 of your cycle - so 2 weeks after your last period started.  Assuming your period isn't late yet, you'd either only be <4 weeks pregnant (which it's incredibly rare for anyone to be showing any sort of sign before their missed period), or for some reason you got your last period despite being pregnant.  I can almost promise you that you're definitely not pregnant.

But yeah, I think there is a lot of similarities between a bad job and a bad relationship. You're not there because you want to be, but because you feel obligated. Oftentimes because you're made to feel obligated by those in a position of power over you. It leads you to feel worse about yourself, hurts your self-image, and fucks with your mental health.  I think a big part of the problem, why people tolerate this from a job more than from a relationship is the way our society looks at work. You have to work or you're treated as a ""lesser"" person. It's not enough to be productive and contribute to society, you have to earn money, and the more the better.

I already had a bed, and my grandma bought me a really awesome bedroom set from Pottery Barn, but I got everything else pretty cheap. I just had an extremely strong vision of what I wanted... Hollywood Glamour/Art Deco meets Mondrian geometric abstract art. I watched too much HGTV growing up..... ANYWAY, here's where I shopped:   Ikea: 2 small tables (that I'll hopefully replace when I get some more $), coasters, a rug, some other random cheap stuff Amazon: throw pillow inserts for some pillowcases I found at a flea market, bookshelf, curtains, cool cart thing, dining set. All the coaster brand stuff looks AMAZING and has tons of personality but is kinda wobbly and cheaply made. Perfect for a first apartment but stuff you'll definitely want to upgrade as you go along. Bed Bath & Beyond: literally everything ever hahaha. all kitchen supplies, bathroom stuff, cleaning stuff. I had like 2 carts full of stuff from clearance racks and what have you. I think I spent $350 here, but I was also starting with nothing whatsoever. Ask around for those 20% coupons because they NEVER EXPIRE EVER. I think between me, my parents, my grandma, and my aunt, we had a coupon for almost every single item. I fucking love BB&B TJ Maxx/Marshall's/Home Goods: picture frames and cute chotchkis. I like the mix-and-match look, so as long as it's under $6, black or silver, and cute, I'll probably buy it. I also bought these 2 royal blue chairs from Home Goods that are the centerpiece for the room. I probably could have gotten cheaper chairs (they were $150/each) but I splurged since they're the focal point. Flea Markets: usually good prices, things with lots of history or meaning, filled with a memory of BEING at the flea market with someone. I got these cool pillow cases with a Joan Miro painting stitched in them that I love. Lighting: I'm a filmmaker, so lighting is like the most important thing ever to me. I have very few overhead lights in my apartment, so after designing a lighting map for the apartment (coughfilmnerdcough) I figured I needed 2-3 standing lights, 2 end table lights, and 2-3 table lamps. I ended up going down to Bowery (I'm in NYC) and there's a 3 block stretch right above Chinatown where every store just sells lights. I got the coolest fucking fixtures (including this one mini chandelier and one standing lamp that looks like it's from a film set) for like $250 after looking around every single store and haggling for the best prices. Not sure if you're in a location that has a district like that, but if you're in NYC I definitely recommend Bowery."
AskTrollX,3bnw1o,sporks_,3,Tue Jun 30 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, there are websites such as Craigslist (if you're not American, your country probably has something similar), where people give away perfectly fine stuff, just because they can't be bothered to drive it off themselves.  When it comes to stores, IKEA is pretty cheap, and I'd recommend thrift shops and flea markets, anything used is always cheaper, and the items are usually perfectly fine."

We did not grow up together but spent every other weekend together for like 3-4 years.  She has never been away from my stepmother for a whole week before, except when she was with her dad (who died earlier this year). I feel like I'm going to need to entertain her/feed her/whatever constantly and I may or may not freaking out at having to be constantly 'on' for like 7 days.  Question!  Anybody have any tips?  Any ideas of activities or things to do?  Tips for surviving without going crazy or killing each other?  Ways to make her less homesick?  Soothing words from troll parents?  Is it possible to keep a kid busy without spending a fortune?"
AskTrollX,3bn1g0,1YearWonder,5,Tue Jun 30 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"Best way to sooth homesickness is distraction, offer to put in a movie or ice cream. Keep it light."

Also try to have some of the food she likes for her too. It really shouldn't cost you a fortune and to be honest I don't think an 11 year old should be too high maintenance. She can tell you if she's bored / hungry / whatever and take care of her own showering / bathing etc so don't worry too much!  Source: Have younger cousins of with about the same age gap, they are not to hard to take care of at all!"
AskTrollX,3bn1g0,MercifulWombat,6,Tue Jun 30 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a little worried she's going to get emotional, because she never goes away from home (my stepmom was panicking about putting her on a plane alone), but I think it'll be a nice break for her to get away from a very full house at home.  And all you said is true--when they're little, like 2-4 (and especially younger) they're way more high maintenance!"
AskTrollX,3bn1g0,koh522,4,Tue Jun 30 15:45:52 2015 UTC,"One good way to look at this if you have a little time to plan is to think about 5 things that you would like to do with her (or more, and let her choose! Kids this age love having just a little responsibility, and they can usually handle it. You'll be surprised how 'mature' an 11yo can be), with the idea of doing one of those things per day. That leaves 2 days open for if the two of you just want to hang out at home and watch movies, or for some spontaneity.   With one excursion per day, that will take care of the majority of the time you guys need to fill. After getting breakfast, heading out into the world, getting lunch, and coming home... there's really not much time more than supper and maybe some chill time before bed.   As for homesickness, that's inevitable. Be kind, and comforting, and maybe let her sleep with you or sit with her until she falls asleep. In my experience, 'good night' phone/Skype calls actually do more damage than good, as it gets the kid thinking about how much they miss their mom right before laying down for the night. Morning or afternoon are better times for calls, as you've still got some time before bed to distract from missing mom.   One thing I have found that kids really enjoy is baking something fun, like cupcakes or cookies (which can then be decorated!). Another fun thing to do at home is to make your own paper.  Fair warning, that craft takes a little longer, so plan ahead and start it earlier in the day. I find kids love mixing up the goop. lol  When the enivetable ""I'm bored!"" thing starts to happen, that's a good time to break out the paper and coloring impliments for her to write mom a letter, draw mom a picture, that kind of thing. It's also good to ask the kid what they want to do, sometimes they have an idea in mind and telling you they're bored is a way of hinting.   Just be interested in her, and don't be too anxious. You got this, and Im sure you'll both have a blast. :)"

In my family we call this the weepy hour--I get so emotional when I'm really tired.  But great advice about not having her call right before bed!  I would not have connected that."
AskTrollX,3bn1g0,koh522,3,Tue Jun 30 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Glad to help! The only other suggestion I have is try to do a fairly large grocery shop before she arrives, that way you wont have to spend much time doing that while she's visiting. Short trips to the store can be fun for kids (especially if it's a part of meal planning, some kids really like cooking!), but too long and they get bored and cranky.   Also, remember that 7 days is a fairly long time. It's totally cool if during that time there are moments that you let her just watch her own stuff on Netflix while you do your own thing. You're both bound to want a little down time at some point."
AskTrollX,3bn1g0,FurryNinjaCat,3,Tue Jun 30 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"By the time they're 11, they can usually feed themselves okay. Do a shopping trip with her so she can pick out some foods she likes to have around the house. There have been a lot of good out and about ""on"" activities already listed, so just try to do one or two a day and don't worry about chilling out for the rest of the day.

I see them everywhere!  In the back is an event calendar for the month. It's actually like 1/3 of the magazine. A lot of it is regular/ongoing stuff (kids area at the local art museum, story time every week at the library) but you probably don't have that on your radar so it'll be good to see.

If you both do it, that's a huge chunk of time. Maybe follow up with mani/pedi if she likes being pampered, and especially if it's something she almost never gets to have done professionally.

Told me what to look for in foundation (very light/pale, small yellow tint - not red, that sort of thing) and helped me navigate eye shadow, even helped me learn how to apply 2-3 colors to make a ""look."" Also helped me understand the world of blush, colors that were good for me, and where to apply specifically for my face. As I got older and was buying more of my own makeup I finally realized how valuable a professional lesson is every now and again! I will do a makeover every so often, just to change things up. Haven't done it since I started having kids - priorities shifted. 😃"

AskTrollX,3bo5o9,cottingleysaros22,7,Tue Jun 30 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"First of all - you are NOT stupid for asking this.  Feel the situation out.  Is this person in to you?  If you think this is true, I would think about trying to make a move.  If that works out in your favor (so many if's here), you should have a conversation with this person about not wanting a relationship and wanting to remain casual.  If (again) you're both into the same thing - awesome!  If not, that's cool too.  Watch out for the feelings, I feel like in almost all FWB situations I've heard of/been in, there's always one person who falls for the other and that doesn't seem to end well.  As for the ""slutty"" part, you should focus on how YOU feel.  If it feels slutty to you and you don't like the ""slutty"" feeling, don't do it.  If you're worried about other people thinking you're a slut - fuck 'em.  It's your body.  Once again for the one night stand part - if you were to have a one night stand and did not enjoy it - then you don't need to have one night stands.  If you have a one night stand and decide it's something that you want to do and then someone else looks at you like you're a bad person - fuck 'em again (not literally).  One night stands vary.  Some people will randomly hook up with a friend with no intention of every doing it again - some people will hook up with a stranger with the intention of never speaking to this person again.  It's kind of a broad question that you asked.  I guess what I'm trying to say is - It's YOUR body and YOUR mind - everybody is different.  Just figure out what makes you happy."

We are both off to university in September, and I know neither of us want a relationship, but.. How do I do this?!   How do I do this, or even ask for it? Will I be seen as 'slutty'?

AskTrollX,3bo5o9,Lanilegend,2,Tue Jun 30 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Just straight up ask, say ""hey we've been friends for a while and you and I aren't really looking for anything serious but I think it could be fun if we just hooked up occasionally nothing serious"" being straight forward instead of beating around the bush is always better. No you will not be a bad person if you have one night stands as long as you and the person you hook up with make and understanding of that and you aren't hurting anyone in the process. Having a one night stand just happens you meet you talk you click, kiss, make out, say hey want to get drinks at my place after this, then boom. Its really easy. As for someone seeing you as slutty, you can't really answer that because to be honest some people might but that's because they are entitled to their own opinions but you also need to remember this isn't 1950, just because you have sex doesn't mean you are a slut like people believed back then. Find you self, explore your sexuality, live your life and don't let others opinions of you dictate how you act. You're young and alive be brave for yourself and do what makes you happy, and if friends with benefits is that then go ahead if it feels strange and uncomfortable its also ok not to have one. Just do what feels right to you."

If it really can't be contained just make sure you're sitting on an old towel or two.  Hopefully you don't have much to do for the next couple of days and can stay home and relatively cool.

When I was goi g through something similar to you I was surprised at how many other women I met who were more or less going through exactly the same thing.

Be, err, straight about it: if you've never been with a woman before, say so. You're curious, and you're open to exploring that.

I've never felt remotely that way about a woman. But YMMV, examining your sexuality in a deep and thoughtful way is probably a better idea than going around oogling everyone's knees."
AskTrollX,3bknlu,Ralynne,5,Tue Jun 30 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"You look around, you see who you think is attractive, and you hit on them if it's socially acceptable to do so right then. Or if you're like me, you hit on them in a very embarrassing fashion. Some of them will be into it, some of them won't, of all genders. It's okay to be confused. I've been pretty secure in my notion of my sexuality for like a decade now, having tested some different things to figure out my favorite bits, and I'm still discovering new things that turn me on or turn me off. It's an adventure!"
AskTrollX,3bknlu,milgrams-shock,4,Tue Jun 30 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"Don't force yourself to find a label. Just go find people you think are attractive and go for it. Maybe do some research on different weird sexualities like demisexual. I consider myself pansexual but have only ever dated straight men because I'm in an LTR now and don't intend on changing that.   A lot of people try to tell me that I can't really be pan/bi since I've never dated women. But. That doesn't change who I'm attracted to. To me, the overwhelming majority of people are on the slightly hot side of normal. I don't think people are ugly, I just think some people are a little more standardly beautiful. That's it.   My advice is to realize that you can and will be attracted to people you're not dating, some you can't date, and some you'd never date. That's okay. It's okay to find people attractive. Think about what attracts you and what you desire out of relationships and worry about labels later. Good luck!"
AskTrollX,3bknlu,Sir_not_sir,3,Tue Jun 30 15:20:19 2015 UTC,What turns you on OR who are you attracted to?
AskTrollX,3bknlu,cicadaselectric,3,Tue Jun 30 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"I used to think I was bisexual.  I didn't tell people but assumed it from early teenage years right up until I actually had sexual encounters and romantic encounters with women.  I realized I was actually completely straight.  I still find women beautiful and (with the exception of my amazing boyfriend) have always been closest with women, rather than men.  So what I'm saying is, give it a try!  Go on okcupid, set your profile as bisexual (and you might be able to turn off messages/hide your profile from men, if you want), and be upfront about how you think you might be bi.  Some women won't want to date you because of that, but some will.  And figure it out!  Go forth and discover!"
AskTrollX,3bknlu,tanglisha,2,Tue Jun 30 15:23:23 2015 UTC,It's a good question to ask yourself if you've never really thought about it before. It's easy to fall into other people's expectations if you never examine how you really feel.

It might be hit or miss, since you don't have time to try it out in advance, but basically you put it over the zit and it sucks the pus out. It works best on zits that are close to popping, and I've found that afterwards it looks the same as if I've popped it, but without the extra damage to my skin.  Also, e.l.f. makes a ""zit zapper"" which is super cheap and I've found it to work fairly well, and I've read lots of reviews that said the same. It's available at Walmart and Target usually.  Other than that, whatever spot acne treatment works for you. There are so many different kinds and skin varies so much that it's difficult to just recommend one.

Hold the cloth to the pimple until it's not hot, and then microwave it again.  Do this over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  And then a few more times.  Basically do it for a few hours.  Put honey on it before bed.  This sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  Mario Badescu buffering lotion for those giant, under the skin, cyst-y ones.

AskTrollX,3bj655,sonalis1092,7,Mon Jun 29 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"You interrupted your REM sleep.  A typical REM cycle lasts an average of 90 mins (though it varies from person to person give or take). That's why experts suggest 7-8 hours of sleep. You need to plan your sleeping time in multiples of 90 mins. When you wake up during the middle of a REM cycle you'll be tired because your cycle didn't complete. An easy way to tell is whether or not you remember your dreams. When you wake up during REM, your dream memories will be vivid. If you don't you aren't likely to remember them.   The best way to get a good nights sleep is to turn off ALL electronics 1 hour before you plan to go to bed, and let your body wake up naturally.   I go to bed around 10:30 PM every night and by around 6:45 or so, my body is ready to get up. On days when I go back to bed and sleep until 8 or 9, I feel more tired than if I'd just gotten up at 6:45."

The contents of this post will reflect that  Christ do I know what you're going through. I cannot really give you general tips, but I can recommend where I find my porn.   Gonewild subs, make sure to check out gonewildaudio and gonewildvideo. I cannot remember the exact names and I'm at work, so I won't be looking anything up. Beautiful Agony and I Feel Myself are wonderful amateur(?) masturbation sites. EvilAngel/BurningAngel is a pretty awesome site for Alt porn with fucking, while Suicide Girls and God's Girls are good for adult modelling. TeenBFF is amateur MFF porn, usually with contact between the F's. It seems pretty loving and like they're actually into the fucking, which is nice. Has porny moments, since there's usually a facial. James Dean is one of the only men I can honestly say I go out of my way to watch. He always seems to be trying to get his partner to finish, which is nice. Ariel Rebel, Larkin Love, and Liz Vicious come to mind as Alt performers I'm into. For rough and/or group sex, Amai Liu, Ashley Blue, and Amber Blank come to mind as performers who actually seem into it. Amai Liu looks pretty young, so be aware of that. Ashley Blue has done some kind of scary stuff, so you be careful going into any video she's in. Amber Blank is mostly into getting tag teamed by a dude with a giant dick and her husband, because they're amateurs into cuckolding and interracial. Anything by the Kink.com network will probably be pretty damn good Most things posted in BDSM subs is going to be good, and there's also /r/chickflixxx to look at.

If it's a slow day (think weekday mornings, not Saturday afternoons), you might luck out and find someone who will go with you to accessories AND shoes after you find a dress or outfit; if not, the people in those departments are pretty helpful at my store, too. I just find it easier to have one person tag along the whole shopping trip than explaining the situation, event, and budget to everyone I encounter.  Good luck!"

First time I've ever been into the fancy running store, and first time I've ever bought fancy running shoes. So. Worth. It.  I'm not a ""runner"" - in fact I hate running. But I've started trying to be more active, and I've even been going to boot camp. Just before my new shoes, I spent a day at the zoo with my kids in my well-worn and loved Nike sneakers I got at Kohl's for $35. My feet ached for days. Something ad to give.  The guy spent almost an hour with me. Measured both my feet, evaluated my gait, looked at my arches. Confirmed a lot of things I already knew but didn't know how to deal with: my left foot is a size 9.5 while my right is between an 8.5 and a 9; I have high arches; I have a neutral walk (don't roll my feet/ankles in or out); I have wide feet. He had three shoes to choose from that were specifically for high arches, wide feet, and a neutral foot. Only three? Well yeah, but that's a pretty specific fit! He also showed me how to lace them on the right foot to keep my foot from slipping around and rubbing, since you buy shoes to fit the bigger foot and then adapt the rest. (Just like buying a dress the size of your largest feature and having it tailored.) The ones I opted for were on sale for $130 after taxes, and honestly it's one of the best footwear purchases I've ever made in my life. I hardly even notice they're there!

I think the quick solution would be to use a magic eraser on the grout and then seal the whole thing.   But white grout on gray floor tile is an odd choice and will always look dirty. If you're feeling handy and you're up for some elbow grease, you could remove the old grout, replace it (probably with grey grout), and then seal the whole thing.   You'd need one of these little grout saws to saw out the old stuff. Then you'd regrout it and seal it. They sell premixed precolored grout, and it's really easy to do. It's hard on your knees but simple.

AskTrollX,3b8joz,wegsmijtaccount,2,Sat Jun 27 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"You have pressed 1, indicating you would like to hear more about grilled guacamole. If this is correct, press..   I'm just kidding...   I can't remember why I thought to do this originally, but it's constantly a hit with anyone I serve it to. I'm constantly asked for the recipe - hell, in a few months, I'll be on the other side of the country for a friend's wedding, and she specifically requested I get the supplies to make it and serve it at her place for an informal barbecue after her wedding. And it's absurdly easy and quick to make. Prep should take about 20-30 minutes at most.   This is for a big batch of it (if you're feeding 3-5 or more people, or plan on using it for several days, go with this amount.. otherwise, half this). And this a very loose recipe (I rarely measure things when I'm cooking - only baking [since that's more about chemistry], I typically just go by taste), but it'll get you there -   6 avocados. slice them in half, and pit them while leaving the skin on. find a pan, bowl, or plate that will comfortable hold all halves, and fill it with about a 1/4"" of olive oil, and generously crack sea salt and black pepper into it (if you don't have sea salt and pepper grinders, get them.. they make all cooking better and are cheap). also include freshly pressed garlic into there - I would approximate about a clove of garlic per two avocados.  Move each half of the avocados around in the oil, flesh-side down, get those spices going on them, and let them 'marinate' for a little bit (like ten minutes-ish), then it's time to grill them. Save the bowl of oil and spices.   Start with the skin-side down. I like to leave a tiny bit of the olive oil/garlic spices mixture in the pit of the avocado while they grill like this. Grill until the skin looks like it's starting to come off of it a tiny bit on the edges. Flip over (you can dump the oil mixture back into your bowl if you want) to flesh-side down. You'll see the flesh side get darker (especially in the seed pit area) and brown a little bit, and you'll see the skin part get lighter and a little brown-yellowish. You basically want some grill marks on the flesh, but not burnt, and the skin to be turning brown-yellow and start to come off on the edges. What's really great about this is that your avocados don't have to be perfectly ripe. If they're still a little hard and green, just leave them on the grill another minute or two until they soften up a bit. Just don't burn them.   Remove from the grill, and spoon the flesh into a bowl WITH the leftover oil and spices. Smash it all up. Finely chop a small onion and a big ol' handful of cilantro, throw that in there. add a little bit of white pepper, cumin, a pinch of sugar, and an optional pinch of chili pepper if you like a kick to it. Add a good bit of fresh-squeezed lime to taste (usually like one full lime per two avocados). The fresh-squeezed part is important - don't bother with lime juice in the bottle. Use a rubber spatula to carefully mix that all up if you like somewhat chunky guac. Or use a whisk or fork if you like super smooth guac.   and bam.. you're done! This will keep for a few days in the fridge afterwards. It'll taste more ripe and coppery the longer you leave it. You can scrape any browning on the top off to get to the still-fresh parts."

AskTrollX,3b5zg0,tortillaandcheese,18,Fri Jun 26 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"disclaimer, my dinner consisted of beer  Honestly, it is hard to make friends as an adult. When you don't have study groups or lab partners or dorm mates to pair up with, it can be very rough. But. Here is where you find out more about you. What do you enjoy doing? Guess what- if you live near a major metropolitan area, there is a meetup with you hobby! And even if those aren't your people, you tried and maybe you got a connection to another set of people who fit you. Making a good friend is a lot like finding a good SO. You never know how or when it might happen- you just have to be open to the experience. So. Search the meet ups, do activities you enjoy, and be bold! Say hi to the chick with the funky glasses who probably likes the same obscure bands as you. Maybe she's your next bff, or maybe she's someone you won't like. You never know until you say hello. So get on out there! Make some lady friends!"
AskTrollX,3b5zg0,mmwright82,8,Fri Jun 26 09:48:30 2015 UTC,"This.  I'm a trollY but the advice stands. I like being able to do an activity if small talk doesn't work out and you meet people with something in common. Check places like meetup.com. If there are specialty stores(running, cycling, knitting, comics) you like, ask if they have a group. Your local govt Parks and Rec department probably has classes/ rec leagues for any skill level. You can also volunteer. Look at food banks/ parks/ theaters. Martial Arts is also fun but look for female teachers/ management and a friendly vibe."

So 3 years ago, we moved here and I moped around for about a year complaining, I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.  NO ONE LIKES ME.  When really, I didn't like anyone at work and I wasn't doing anything about the friend situation.  So I started browsing around meetup.com and the main knitting site (because I am a knitter) to find small, regular meetups in things that I was interested in.  It took about 10 different meetups before I found something click and now I have 10 very close, very awesome friends.  :)    Find some meetup groups in some kind of activity you like or would like to learn.

When I lived in a smaller town (like, on the edge of Amish country), there was a Young Professionals club, a Frisbee golf league, a casual softball league, etc etc.  You just have to do work to find what you are interested in.  A lot of counties will offer classes for adults so check that out too.  I am going to be doing a kickboxing class at the local high school with a friend soon.

The best advice that I would give is to over communicate and take things slower at first.

Lots of people in TrollX, including several of the mods, are polyamorous.   As /u/senor_haugh says, polygamy is for multiple spouses and in some places is something of a unwelcome term because of its connections with fundamentalist mormon cults and bad press. Other key differences are between swinging and polyamory, in that swinging does not necessarily have the romantic and loving component.   Feel free to ask!"

AskTrollX,3b3jse,pk453,16,Thu Jun 25 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"This question is exactly what I have constantly wrestled with in relationships. I am finally figuring out how to bring things up now that I have a boyfriend who isn't a turd burglar so I think maybe I have some insight. My process for this is to remind myself that if I am upset by it, there has to be a reason why I am. Then I try to target the reason. I think about all the logical reasons it bothers me and all the illogical reasons, and then I decide if it's worth bringing up. If it is, usually it'll just be like, ""Hey this upsets me. I don't like this because of ___."" And then I let him say his piece, and let him decide that me being upset by it is worth him not doing it anymore. Because ultimately the most important thing in a relationship is that he respects you. If he respects you, he will listen to what bothers you and amend his actions to keep from making you upset. If it's something small that should be no problem, but if it's something systemic or that's part of his personality it may be that you two aren't compatible. And also, you will need to learn how to bring things up if you intend to be seriously with this guy because things will ALWAYS come up, and it is important to have ways that you two work things out together if you want it to last. Each little argument or hurt feeling is another Lego in your sweet-ass relationship spaceship. Because each time, you learn what upsets the other person, what their boundaries are, and how they deal with things when they are upset. Just say it, and if he makes you feel bad about it or doesn't care that it upsets you, get outta there ASAP. Hopefully that helps!"

AskTrollX,3b3jse,koalapants,4,Thu Jun 25 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have a hard time feeling bad for bringing up a problem.  I feel like if I'm having an issue, it needs to be resolved before it turns into resentment.  I think the best way to bring it up is something along the lines of, ""Hey there's something that's been bothering me that I wanted to talk you you about.  When you do [thing], it makes me feel [feeling].""  And possibly offer a solution if you can think of one.  Very bad and totally made up example: ""When you comment that I don't wear enough makeup, I feel like I'm not pretty enough for you."""
AskTrollX,3b3jse,mmwright82,2,Thu Jun 25 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"I agree! Bringing it up when it is a little problem and you're just a bit irked helps you to remain more calm too. If you wait, the irked feeling slip into anger/sadness/passive aggressive behaviors. Your SO may not know about the issue or that the issue is hurtful to you- so speak up! Remember that being in a relationship is supposed to benefit both people.   A lot of young ladies are trained to be polite, not say no, not be angry, not have needs, etc. You are supposed to smile and look pretty and cater to your man. If you DO have a feeling or a need, your SO will get mad and you'll never find another SO ever again. Or, that's at least the subtext of how many young ladies are raised. And that is simply not true.  All people have needs. All people deserve to be able to voice those needs. You fall in to the category of people. Allow yourself to be ok with having feelings, having needs, and deserving to be respectfully heard."

So I put a higher price on dresses, but cheap on jewelry.   The top I got was a nice striped tshirt with lace overlays on the front shoulder area that was over like a cut-out.  The invoice said $44 but then when I did the transaction online it discounted -$20 and said ""styling fee"". I think you get charged $20 if you send back everything. But if you pick at least one item it's taken out? That part is a little fuzzy. But all I know is I got the shirt for $22  PS. You can make an account and fill out all the questionnaire stuff without making an order - its kind of fun.   If you do sign make an order, will you use my referral link? You'll and I would get a $25 credit :D https://stitchfix.com/referral/5214220"
AskTrollX,3b3h3c,takesometimetoday,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Ohhh that's great that you can choose price point per item. I am also more willing to spend money on dresses than jewelry. So I think the $20 thing is the ""styling fee"" that you pay for every box. So if you didn't end up buying anything, it would cost $20, but if you keep something, the $20 is applied to your item(s).   If I make an order I'll definitely use your referral code! :)"

I mean, the most important thing is that he's just a fantastic person, the kind of guy who is respectful to everyone (people helping him on the phone, servers/cashiers) and helps people without being asked (or for asking anything in return).  But here's what popped in my head first:  I love how he looks at me when I walk in the door, he just completely lights up like I'm the best thing he's ever seen, like everything in the world is right again.

Personally, I like wearing shirts or dresses that sit at my natural waist ( under you ribs slash at your belly button) that go to my knee. Jeans with a slight flare are good at showing your but while evening out your overall shape."
AskTrollX,3b0uuq,milgrams-shock,2,Thu Jun 25 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Same here - 32B boobs, huuuuge hips/butt. I think I look best in tight fitting tops and a skirt that sits at my natural waist, usually flared out or a-line.   For tops, I agree that boat-neck is really flattering.  I also feel like we can get away with more cleavage-baring tops than more endowed women, so I go for that look often.   I know many curvy women like to rock pencil skirts, and I think they do look great, but I have a bit of a gamine-style aesthetic and pencil skirts don't really fit in with that anyway. Also, and I know this is going to be unpopular here, but I honestly hate the male attention that skirts like that bring to my posterior.  It's a personal choice.  I just can't stand being catcalled, it makes me really uncomfortable, and being in NYC it's unavoidable.  So it's a win-win that I both like a-line skirts and they look super great on me."
AskTrollX,3b0uuq,airial,10,Thu Jun 25 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yessss. Peplum tops are awesome, and pencil skirts, and basically anything in an article that's supposed to accentuate your booty. If you look for articles for top heavy women, where they're trying to balance, or straight up-and-down women, where they're trying to create the illusion of curves, you should find ideas. Also, belting and accentuating your waist. The smaller your waist looks the bigger your butt will look. I'm pear shaped and all about the booty.   For boobs, cleavage still looks nice with small boobs, or in the other direction boat necks look lovely. You can experiment with different shaped necklines and find what makes you feel prettiest. It's really nice to be able to show decolletage without cleavage, too. And I would recommend finding a good shaped foam cup bra (not necessarily padded, but structured) for when you want polish and/or oomph and a soft cup bra for when you want support but want to be comfy.   I hope this is helpful!"

AskTrollX,3b0pe0,SunnySplosion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"I personally remember having trouble with my SD cards when I first purchased my T3i. Every picture or video I took came out unreadable or corrupt and I wasn't sure why.  Well it turns out that there are different 'classes' of SD cards, and they all have different 'write' speeds essentially. For the quality of picture I was trying to take, my SD card couldn't write it down fast enough. I later found out that I needed a 'class 10' SD card in order to do pretty basic things on my DSLR. So perhaps your SD card was too low quality for the type of pictures you were trying to take. I've found that this goes 10 fold for video; you typically need a pretty high up there SD card to write fast enough.  It's relatively difficult to find out exactly what class your SD card is sometimes, so you can probably think this as a rule of thumb: old or cheap = low class. When buying a new one, if you ever do, just make sure it's the optimal class for your camera.  Another thing that comes to mind is whether or not your SD card reader actually works. I've found that on laptops, SD card readers are cheap and tend to break easily (it's even worse for thin laptops). Perhaps you have another SD card reader that you can try, or some compressed air to try to clean it out.  Finally, maybe you could try to update your SD card readers drivers (through windows).  I don't know how to get into the details of opening the case to get the data inside, as I've never had to deal with it, but I hope this advice helps. If all is lost, perhaps you could call someone from a Cardinal Camera and get some assistance professionally! They tend to be extremely useful in these situations."
AskTrollX,3ax7r6,BitchesMakePuppies,2,Wed Jun 24 05:52:16 2015 UTC,"While in college, a friend of mine, let's call him Ezra, was interested in me. I was semi/totally oblivious to it at the time, and he never really pursued me, we just flirted heavily and we told mutual friends we thought each other were awesome. We went separate ways, I've moved across the country for work, and now work in a small town about seven hours away from where he lives, in a big city. We have a lot in common, share a lot of the same personality traits/sarcasm and idealogical views, and troll-ish awesomeness.   Last year he broke up with a long-time lady friend, and since then he texts me occasionally (2x/week?) random things to start conversation. After college and until now, we neverrrrr kept in contact other than very seldom FB interactions (no messaging, just likes/comments/etc). He also says he really needs to get out of the city and visit up where we went to college/near me, and says that when I go to the city he lives in, to let him know. He's mentioned hanging out. He basically always initiates conversation, so I feel bad, but I don't know what the fuck I should say without sounding GF-y ie. ""How's your day?"" Is that GF-y? Idk.  I guess I'd just like to flesh out what his sudden interest is/means without straight up asking him, or is there a way to do that, or should I not do that? I'm the actual worse at flirting and texting and adulting and shit, and while I am genuinely interested in continuing talking/texting with him, what do I text him to initiate conversation for the day if I don't see something that reminds me of him? I know I should have figured out adult interactions by now, but I haven't so please help my poor soul. I guess I should also mention that I'm not 10000% sure he's into me, but I'm not sure why he'd initiate contact randomly five years later if he just wanted to chat."
AskTrollX,3ax7r6,squeakyrobot,2,Wed Jun 24 05:52:39 2015 UTC,"Can you share an example of what he texts you to start conversations?  If I wanted to start a convo, I'd try to stick with a similar tone/topic.  Or just go the totally random route.  You don't necessarily have to see something that reminds you of him.   ""Traffic's crazy today, not sure why.  Maybe it's just here, or is it bad in city he lives too?"" ""Coworker did/said the weirdest thing today"" (because everyone has a weird coworker, right?  I'm totally the weird coworker myself, fyi.) ""Have you seen movie title?  Previews look good, but I don't know anyone who's seen it.""   I guess I'd just like to flesh out what his sudden interest is/means without straight up asking him, or is there a way to do that, or should I not do that?   I mean, if it was me, I'd be curious and would probably ask, ""It's really nice reconnecting with you - why'd we go so long without chatting much?"" but it might not get you much of an answer because it's not like a ""Dude, do you like me or something?"" thing.  If you like traveling, why not plan a weekend trip to his city?  (I've done that before when I had a crush on a college friend who lived in a different city, hours away.  It went well.)  You could say, ""Hey, so I'm thinking about checking out your city for a couple days.  I'd like to catch up with you while I'm in the area.  Or if you're busy, I'd love some recommendations on places to go.""  I wouldn't book anything until you get a response, like if he asked when you were going to be there, you could say ""Oh, haven't booked anything yet, I was thinking either the 23rd/24th or the 29th/30th"" - he might either say one weekend is better for him... or he might have a specific recommendation based on some festival that you should check out or something.  I mean, honestly, I wouldn't recommend that unless you really would plan to visit whether or not he'd meet up with you.  But traveling is awesome, even just weekend trips!  I might be over thinking things here, haha."

And I wouldn't worry too much about sounding GF-y, I mean if things go south he lives far away and you could avoid him if you wanted. He wants to talk to you, clearly, so I think he'll build off of any text you send him, even if it's just random shit from your day. I guess how much you guys text and what it's about would give you clues as to his interest.  So, basically, talk about random stuff that happens to you and he'll probably respond in kind."

I decided to have a different personality. I copied those who I envied until I was a different person. It's surprisingly easy. I got popular.   However, I realised when I became an adult that this wasn't quite going to cut it. So I started hanging out in a pub that was well known for a lot of tourist activity plus a good group of regulars. I made myself interact with all of these people. I learned how to subtly change how I come across to each person.   This has helped remarkably well with my social skills (useful in personal life and in my career) but has sadly left me with a not altogether healthy alcohol habit!

AskTrollX,3aw02p,smusasha,4,Wed Jun 24 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on what kind of vertigo, I guess.  I've had positional vertigo exactly once and it was NO FUN AT ALL. Every time I tilted my head to either side it felt like trying to sleep after an evening of non-stop daiquiris—everything spun.  I went to a physiotherapist office (because I was leaving for Europe in a week and didn't have time to wait for it to resolve itself on its own) and after some assessing they did the Epley maneuver which sorted it right out.  My mother, on the other hand, has suffered from vertigo her entire life. She's had the occasional positional attack which the Epley maneuver has solved, but as a general rule she gets dizzy on small bridges, high patios and near ledges. She'll even get it if she's riding as the passenger in a car (she's better when driving because she can hold onto the steering wheel). Unfortunately, she's only now (in her fifties) started seeking medical treatment for it so the only advice I can give is to avoid ledges and see if you can get an appointment with an ENT or visit a physiotherapist that specializes in dizziness/balance."
AskTrollX,3aw02p,corkmaster,3,Wed Jun 24 15:32:52 2015 UTC,A coworker of mine has an issue with dizziness and he takes meclizine.  Neither I or he are doctors so take our advice with a grain of salt.  It did help the dizziness I get when I go off ssri's.

Is that correct? If so, it sounds like you should sit down and talk. ""I know you want to lose weight, and I want you to be healthy [if it is indeed a health concern], and I want to support you in doing what you want to do, including this. I know it's really bothering you, so I think we should really tackle this together so you feel good. How can I help?"" And you can brainstorm together.   Some options include: supporting her in being active (go to gym together, go hiking together, put aside money in your budget for her to go to those dance classes she likes but are expensive), and shifting what you're cooking.   Other options, if this is something she's really having trouble with, include seeing a nutritionist, and/or getting some personal training - either could help jump start things."

We are Minnesotans who moved to North Dakota, so my food groups have been Potatoes, Butter, Salt, Sauerkraut, and Ground Beef.    Any suggestions for healthy eating without a lot of produce?  I only ask because we live in a town of 1000 people, and the grocery store produce isn't always the freshest.  And also everything that isn't a potato or onion is about twice as expensive as it was in Minneapolis.  We've got a big garden, but it won't get us all the produce we need.  The activity thing is kind of a downer for her.  I do go to the gym a fair amount (3 times a week or so), and she's perpetually reluctant.  But!  You had a good idea.

The great thing about weight loss is that you don't need to buy all organic fancy pants produce like some people seem to think. You don't even need produce. Produce is nice because it allows you to eat more with less the calories. But realistically if she just eats less calories than she is putting out she will start getting results. She can start by cutting portions. Do you serve her? Give her a smaller amount. She could also cut out sugary sodas, gatorades, and coffees and lose a significant amount if she is into those things. Maybe try cooking with less cheese and butter and when you do need it switch to low fat cheese and low cal butter  It all comes down to calories. She should look into downloading myfitnesspal on her phone and entering a normal day. Then seeing where she can cut things out."

AskTrollX,3aucrp,queenkellee,14,Tue Jun 23 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"/r/EatCheapAndHealthy  There's really no getting around buying more produce, but you can supplement a small/crappy produce section with frozen veggies, or if there's a costco within driving distance, you can buy a ton of fresh produce in bulk, spend a day preparing it (soups, stews, cutting and freezing raw portions), and be stocked up for a while.  The biggest thing is replacing beef with healthier proteins (plant-based is better! Lentils and beans!) and refined starches with whole grains. Barley, quinoa, brown rice, farro, kasha (aka buckwheat). Potatoes and butter are not UNhealthy, but everything in moderation, you know? Also please don't stop salting your food. Salt is so important for making healthy food taste good, and it's really not bad for you as long as you're not dumping in a huge amount. Make sure you're using kosher salt or sea salt, not table salt, though!  Sprouted Kitchen and The Kitchn are great food blogs with tons of healthy yummy recipes. The Kitchn is especially great because you can search their recipe catalog by ingredient, cuisine, time it takes to cook, etc."
AskTrollX,3aucrp,andyflip,3,Tue Jun 23 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"I exclusively use sea salt.  I didn't know it was any healthier than normal salt.  I just thought it tasted better.

She's really been pushing me to eat/cook more quinoa.  Guess I'll bite the bullet and start making it.  I wish tortilla chips were healthier.

Here's what I would do with it: chop up lettuce, red bell peppers, cukes, carrots, celery, grill or bake some chicken breasts and shred or cube them, then put your kickass salsa on top as a sort of dressing. Or (I am now seeing your comment about produce being expensive) just slather the salsa right on the chicken breasts themselves. Easy Peasey."

AskTrollX,3aucrp,goodybucket,8,Wed Jun 24 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if sea salt is healthier, but because of the coarser grains it takes less salt to flavor your food, so IMO it is a better use of your salt. It also tastes better, like you said.  You can make quinoa taste a lot better by cooking your quinoa in half water, half vegetable (or chicken) stock. Also, try having quinoa as a cold grain salad. Make it the night before and chill it in the fridge, then mix it with a dressing of red wine vinegar/dijon mustard/squirt of honey/red pepper flakes/olive oil. You can mix in whatever veg you have - cubed cucumbers, sliced up tomatoes, can of beans, etc. Quinoa is also a great substitute as a base for stir fries (instead of rice) or to round out a casserole dish (instead of pasta.)  I personally really like quesadillas and breakfast burritos with salsa. Not the healthiest because of the tortillas, but at least they're not deep fried. If you're just looking for something as a dipping vessel for snacking, my suggestions would be: super thin slices of zucchini, wedges of bell pepper, any sort of veggie you can turn into a chip shape basically. As long as the salsa is good, the thing you put it on to deliver it to your mouth won't matter. :)  No problem. Cooking and especially cooking healthy AND delicious food is a huge passion of mine. If you have any other questions, I'm happy to help."

AskTrollX,3aucrp,handsupamazing,6,Tue Jun 23 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"I use salsa on eggs (plus some cheese, but that's optional) for a bomb breakfast. You could serve it on some simple healthy grilled chicken softshell tacos.   2 good sites I use for healthier stuff is   skinnytaste http://www.skinnytaste.com/   and kalyns kitchen  http://www.kalynskitchen.com/  Personally I love riffing on the context of salads. Way beyond lettuce salads (but those too): pasta salads, bean salads, pasta + beans, lentil salads (warm and cold), moving into adding whole grains sometimes too. What's great is you can put in exactly what you love/have available (from a few simple items to loads of different stuff), add some spices and herbs, oil and acid (vinegar, lime or lemon work great) Or I'll make a super chop salad with all kinds of stuff but also lettuce too. This is great for summer when you've got the garden. In the winter it can be simplified to what's available and cheap at the store.   Another tip is beans and lentils. From hummus, sides, soups, and main dishes too like home made veggie burgers (so many recipes online) and this awesome brown rice/lentil mix made with beef broth and taco seasoning (I also add pintos) makes a super yummy almost-vegetarian (beef broth) but also healthier meal a la faux tacos. Another way to use your salsa. You can also add lentils to ground beef to stretch them (and cut the fat/calories), budget bytes has a recipe for sloppy joes that use half and half meat and lentils. Also subbing ground turkey or ground chicken or ground pork for ground beef is a way to cut back. I make turkey burgers that are really good: add fine chopped onion, garlic, fresh parsley, worscheshire sauce, breadcrumbs, egg, mix it up and make patties. I make a whole batch of these and freeze the leftovers."

I know there's farms in ND, for an up-front price you get a share of some farm's produce for the season (basically a box or a bag a week with more fresh veggies than you can imagine. it'll push your cooking boundaries, which is a fun challenge in itself) dude, yeah, quinoa. tasty stuff. swap out potatoes, swap in quinoa. not every day, but try it once in a while. try having a meatless day a week (e.g. meatless monday). sidestepping the vegan vs keto debate, it'll push you into trying some new stuff, broadening your food horizons. take a look at some food blogs. my wife has a major crush on The Pioneer Woman and Smitten Kitchen. again, variety and new experiences are satisfying in themselves. turn dessert or eating out into a weekly reward. you gotta play tennis 3 days and do 2 2-mile walks to get dessert. You like gaming? Dessert = leveling. 1-10 is all easy, but you gotta really grind some health dungeons to earn dessert at level 70. (Don't try and go cold turkey on stuff you like now. It will drain your motivation and you'll snap and binge and feel like shit for failing. Even The Rock has a cheat day.) Contests sometimes work with my wife and I. (We had one where winning was whoever lost the most total inches from neck + arms + chest + stomach + hips + thighs + calves. Turns out that was a sucker bet and she destroyed me by like 15"". I still don't know how I lost so badly - I lost more total lbs, but we both looked great for our wedding.) sign up for a 5k run together. ""couch to 5k"" training programs are a thing, and pretty straightforward if you stick to it. finishing that first race feels good, even if you walked a bunch. I mean, people cheer and clap when you cross the finish line. It's basically real life guitar hero. don't beat yourselves up if your attempts fail a couple times. losing weight is hard. keep trying new things until you find something that works for you. I've biked 800 miles this year and I've lost about 5 lbs. It's frustrating as shit. but my heart is pretty damn healthy these days, my clothes are way looser, and I have faith that the weight loss will come as I adjust my eating habits (for me: fewer chips/junk & less beer are my goals)."

As I was told they leave the bullshit smelly stuff to Minnesotans.  (Chicken, Soy, Pigs, etc.)  We purchased a CSA share in Minneapolis, but these people aren't into CSAs.  It's big agg.  Cultivating a 3 or 4 acre farm to feed the town's varying produce demands just isn't economical.  As in I can make mashed quinoa?  Cuz gotta admit that would be awesome.  Or just in things like the veggie bake I made today?  When my wife and I first met we did a year of no cow products.  I honestly think we can do the meatless thing just fine.  I'll check the food blogs out.  Dessert = boss fight.  Got it.  Health dungeons, for future reference, is a weak metaphor(?).  Also, yea, I think it'll help both of us to think of it like that.

AskTrollX,3aucrp,hotheadnchickn,3,Tue Jun 23 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm, healthy eating necessarily involves a lot of produce. It's tough when you don't have as much access to that as you want. I get that the cost is real, too.   A few things. I don't know what your financial constraints are, but if you can, produce is worth it--even without thinking about weight, produce is crucial for your health--some vitamins and nutrients are only available from produce. And the fiber is important, too. So, if you can, the money is worth it. It's a long term investment--in your health and hers, and her feeling good.   But I understand not everyone can rebudget, and saving money is still good. What about frozen and canned produce? Those tend to be cheaper, and some are really good.   You might want to get a cookbook - like Mark Bittman's Food Matters or VB6 cookbook. The first one, I have, and is pretty simple and tasty.   Tennis is great! Go for it. :)"

No carbs. No alcohol. Then, once a day they have a ""cheat day"" in which they eat and drink whatever they want - carbs, sweets, wine (not a binge day just a ""have it your way"" day). This diet has a name but, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.   They pair that with daily exercise.

Anyway, I think the most important thing is: if you really want to help her lose weight and feel good about herself, then you should do everything with her.

If she is so reluctant to go to the gym, I would focus my energy of trying to find something else she actually enjoys instead of trying to convince her to come along.  In February, I started working out at home 2-3 times a week and it has been amazingly easy for me to stick to it. I'm doing the Recommended Routine from /r/bodyweightfitness and I'm loving it, I've improved so much over the last few months. If that doesn't float her boat, there are lots of other sports you can do by yourself or with a partner outside the gym."

AskTrollX,3aucrp,is-this-kosher,12,Thu Jun 25 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"also: if it were me, I'd want to feel like my guy was helping me because he wants to support me in doing things I want to do, and because he cares about my health. I'd want him to be psyched for a healthy me - not a ""hot wife"", or anything that makes me feel like I'm not good enough as is.   The carb comments are problematic because they're micromanaging. Almost no one wants that. Your wife is an adult who you can and should support in her goal--while treating her like an adult, not a child. She knows if she's eating a cookie, that there are carbs in it. She's not an idiot. A better approach, in that moment, is, say, if she's an emotional eater, to ask what she's stressed about. If it's not about that--I wouldn't say anything. No one's diet is perfect, and she knows it without you pointing it out."

My other half can tell when I'm stressed and when I'm ransacking the cupboards looking for cookies, snacks, etc. at his place he reminds me jokingly ""we don't eat our feelings"".

AskTrollX,3aucrp,slynkyminx,9,Wed Jun 24 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"Ctrl+F ""calorie counting"", 0 hits  I lost 30lbs last year due to strict calorie counting. I bought a food scale, and logged all my food onto MyFitnessPal before eating. I stuck to 1200-1300 calories a day, normally keeping my meals between 300-400 calories (with some room for snacks). Eating better and exercising are great too, but losing weight is a simple equations: calories in < calories out. Tracking calories is the best way to do this.  One more tip: my relationship with food changed - it HAD to change. Food no longer was my comfort, food was simply a vessel for nutrition. It sounds sad, but my relationship with food had to change in order to beat my health problems. Unfortunately, it had a negative affect on my relationship as well - food used to be our way of showing love for each other(""I bought you some donuts today, I know chocolate is your favorite""), but now we had to find a new way to show love. It will be very, very, very difficult for your wife to lose weight unless you are 100% supportive - and this might involve changing how you show love through cooking."
AskTrollX,3aucrp,slynkyminx,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's some hard hitting but effective advice.  I keep thinking of that professor that decided to prove that carbs, fats, whatever were not the key to losing weight and ate nothing but hostess for a year but kept his calories down and lost like 20 pounds.    It does seem to me that calories are key.    The only problem I have with exclusively calorie counting as the method is, how do you gain muscle mass?  If you want to switch to be a healthy, fit person, where do you get the protein to build muscles without the ridiculous amount of calories that go along with most protein rich foods?"
AskTrollX,3aucrp,hotheadnchickn,3,Wed Jun 24 01:20:22 2015 UTC,"where do you get the protein to build muscles without the ridiculous amount of calories that go along with most protein rich foods   There are actually lots of protein rich foods that don't have that many calories. For example, 100g of shrimp have 99 calories and 21g of protein. 100g of chicken breast without skin have 110 calories and 23g of protein. 100g of low fat cottage cheese has around 86 calories and 12g of protein. Other seafood, turkey and tofu are also good protein sources, and lean beef and eggs are actually also not bad.  So yes, exclusively calorie counting as a method is probably not a good idea. You definitely have to pay attention to what you eat. That being said, serious fat loss and serious gain of muscle mass are not really possible at the same time, but you can definitely gain some muscle mass while losing fat."

AskTrollX,3aucrp,DefinitelyNotFreud,2,Thu Jun 25 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"Ha, I'm not sure how to gain muscle mass! I cut down pretty easily, but I haven't started gaining muscle. I hate exercising, haven't found my calling there. I'm not an expert, but many people say to focus on cutting first, then gaining muscle mass. Trying to do both at the same time will be difficult and frustrating when there are no results."
AskTrollX,3aucrp,Willravel,2,Wed Jun 24 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Gaining muscle mass pretty much requires you to eat at calorie surplus (not taking account noob gains), which means weight gain and I think that's not the goal here. Losing weight requires eating at decifit. Yes, it means losing some muscle mass also. But it can be minimized by focusing on the quality of food and the right kind of exercise. And losing a little bit of muscle mass during weight loss progress isn't necessarily unhealthy. Habits, activity and diet are more important, tbh."
AskTrollX,3aucrp,Willravel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"How much did your diet change other than just calorie count? I've been staying under 1400 calories a day and I've lost nothing. Then I've seen a bunch of stuff online that says, ""It's not about calories, it's about carbs."" Then I read, ""It doesn't matter as long as you cut calories."" So, basically, did you cut carbs or did you just eat fewer calories?"
AskTrollX,3aucrp,gowahoo,3,Thu Jun 25 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"I focused on a lower calorie count, but I saw my meals start to change in order to accommodate a ""satisfied"" feeling while eating a lot less. For example: I started realizing that if I upped my protein, I would feel full for a longer period of time. Carbs, such as pasta/pizza/rice, offered very low protein for the amount of calories ingested. I ended up eating a lot more lean meats (chicken, turkey) since they had a great protein-to-calorie ratio. I also started eating protein bars, which have carbs, but also have a great protein to calorie ratio. I still ate carbs, but I ended up eating a lot less."

I started seeing someone a few months ago after years of it being a good idea but being too afraid. It's hard for me to open up, I was worried I would just go week after week and sit in terrible silence and be unable to speak. But I got lucky and got a good match. If it doesn't feel right with your therapist, you can find a different one! It can take some trial and error to find the right fit.    Your first appointment, as others have said, will mostly just be taking a bit about why you decided to seek help, and then talking about your background. I left my first few sessions with my stomach in knots and incredibly anxious. It WAS hard for me to open up. But I worked on it, and it got better. It was helpful for me to tell her that I was struggling, and that it was really challenging to be there. You don't have to feel uncomfortable about anything like that. They know it's hard, and they just want to help you."

Inventory at work is on Tuesday with a ton of prep work from now up until that point so me leaving is quite a pain in the ass. I technically will be home Sunday night but wanted Monday off to relax. The thing is, my work is closed Friday and my boyfriend and i would like to leave on a trip Thursday after work. Traffic may be horrendous and fuck everything up, so I want to ask to come in Monday if she will let me leave early on Thursday the 2nd. I will write what I am thinking of saying, please tell me if you think it is reasonable or absolutely ridiculous and something I should not even consider asking.

I realize that there is a lot of work with inventory happening so if I could leave early on Thursday I could rearrange some things in order to make it in on Monday for inventory prep"".  This shows your willing to make an effort and you're not giving away that you can already work on Monday even if she doesn't give you Thursday early off. By saying you can rearrange things it doesn't come off as you just wanting to take the day off to relax which, although entirely understandable, given the amount of work and your boss's unpredictability might come off more negative.

As for boots, I don't have many, but I know some people buy special inserts that keep them upright so they can keep their shape, but if you don't want to spend money on that, you can repurpose old towels/rags/tshirts, or even newspaper, for that.

AskTrollX,3amrlg,growlzie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, I get it. To be fair, if something with claws and sharp teeth is attacking you, you're probably not focused on the amount of force that you're using because your first instinct is to protect yourself."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,RussianAsshole,2,Mon Jun 22 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"I worked as a vet assistant, grooming assistant and just generally around animals (farm, training family and friends dogs... Etc) almost all animals will lash out and then run unless you pose a continued threat to them. If we are talking about a big dog thinking you are a major threat and he is in super attack mode, punching and protecting yourself is one thing. If it's a little dog being stupid and macho, just a small kick will usually do the trick. If a cat swats at you because it's an ass hole, generally it does it once and you're good...  If someone hurts an animal (like injures it) for these reasons they probably need to check their force, have some major issues, or the dog is cujo.   I've been bitten in the face as a kid, scratched decently enough to need stitches by a cat as a kid, and taken many cat scratches to the hand and arm (and maybe a bite or two) animals almost always give you a major warning before losing their shit and if you don't heed it, that's on you."

So yeah, while nice animal-hating people are probably out there (I've no doubt they exist), I've personally never met one and it would be a red flag for me. To me it says, ""I hate being mildly inconvenienced or being asked to be flexible in any way"" or ""I don't like it when things don't obey or understand me when I communicate with them"".   I've heard many people who say they don't like cats say it's because a cat won't do what you say, or that it's too hard to make a dog listen to you.   But if the only reason you'd want a pet is for the power trip of having a weaker animal completely subjugated to you, you're kind of a shitty person anyway."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,danceswithronin,2,Mon Jun 22 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone hates those things anyway. ""Like what I like or I'll draw outlandish conclusions about the reason behind why you don't like that thing! Never mind you having any trauma related to pets or anything that would require me to have empathy for someone else's experiences!"" I get that you acknowledge that not everyone who dislikes animals is an asshole but this is such a sensitive topic to me because even in real life, people act like I'M being insulting when I'm scared of their dog (even when they allowed it to get really close to me before even being a considerate human being and asking first if I was okay with having a dog present, as to not trigger any anxiety attack or harsh emotional reaction). If I had a pet in my house, I would first ask my guests if they were okay with having a dog/cat/etc just roaming around so I don't make them uncomfortable, but I guess I just don't like making people feel anxious or unsafe.   Especially when it's YOUR pet that you love and train and take care of, of course it's super frustrating when they don't even acknowledge you, especially cats."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,RussianAsshole,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"I have to be pretty cognizant of peoples' reactions to my dogs, because they go into public with me every day. My dogs are the official ""shop dogs"" at my place of business, so they interact with members of the public constantly.  I'm always sure to make sure the dogs are kept in an inner office, and that they don't get direct access to customers unless the customers see the dogs and want to meet them.   We've only had one customer who vocalized a fear of dogs, and whenever he's around we just put them up where he can't be exposed to them.    If I had a pet in my house, I would first ask my guests if they were okay with having a dog/cat/etc just roaming around so I don't make them uncomfortable, but I guess I just don't like making people feel anxious or unsafe.    I always do this myself, but like you say, I feel like it's just a basic common courtesy thing (manners are king in the South where I live) and some people are kind of insensitive jerks.    Especially when it's YOUR pet that you love and train and take care of, of course it's super frustrating when they don't even acknowledge you, especially cats.    I dunno, I guess I don't have much experience with this. Only one cat I've ever had in my whole life didn't want shit to do with people, and she was a barn cat who didn't have much interaction with humans. But the rest of them were all as affectionate as dogs and wanted to be with you - I even trained them to come when you whistle."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,danceswithronin,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a reasonable way to handle having dogs in your shop- no direct contact with customers unless they're comfortable.   Ugh god yes a pet owner who FINALLY realizes that ignoring your guests' possible fears is an asshole move! I went to this girl's house once to meet up with my friends, and her mom kept harping on my intense fear of her dogs and didn't even ask if I would want them to be caged so I wouldn't keep having anxiety attacks. She was all, ""how can you be scared of such a tiny dog!! I can't believe you're SCARED of him!"" Like thanks for being a total douchebag and making a guest feel totally alienated. Such a disgusting way to treat someone when they're supposed to feel welcome in your HOME. Guess I just grew up watching my mom be the best hostess ever, so her habits rubbed off on me. Thank you for being one of the few pet owners who actually cares.   This is totally anecdotal but most cats that I've interacted with are usually in their own little world unless you make a ton of psst noises a bunch of times, or you really do something to grab their attention. That's crazy (in a good way), cause cats generally seem to walk around like they don't even want to acknowledge their owner's existence. You're a good pet owner."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,RussianAsshole,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"Like thanks for being a total douchebag and making a guest feel totally alienated.    Okay, so on the flip side of this, I do find it pretty incomprehensible when someone is afraid of a small dog. A large dog I can understand - I've been in a standoff with an angry (loose!!!!) English Mastiff that was easily two hundred pounds, and I about pissed myself. It was like getting singled out by Cujo, and I was in the middle of an isolated rural area with no weapons except a set of keys, and completely alone - if the dog decided to knock me down and rip my throat out, it could have and nobody would have been close enough to hear me scream.   But when people are afraid of my dogs - the largest of which is twelve pounds - it is a little silly to me. I won't tease them about it or make them feel bad, but secretly I'm thinking it (as I put my dogs away to make them more comfortable). I mean, if my dog attacked me I could literally punt her across the room like a soccer ball. I don't understand it when anyone is scared of something that doesn't pose much of a real danger to them. But phobias are irrational fears by nature.    You're a good pet owner.    Thanks! I'm one of those crazy motherfuckers who drags their dogs everywhere, so I have to be. I pride myself on making sure my dogs are obedience trained to the level of service dogs by the time they're completely grown, so they don't make a nuisance out of themselves.   I have no problem catering to people who don't like dogs or are afraid of them if they let me know (otherwise I will parade my dogs around them because my dogs are practically an extension of me - anywhere I go, they go). I just don't ""get it"" when people don't like animals or are afraid of them, because I have always been closer to animals than to people and have always related to them more easily than with people. People have been jokingly calling me a beastmaster ever since I was a kid. I raised nine baby opossums in my apartment my freshman year of college.   That being said, I know if I was in the place of someone who was afraid of dogs, that I would appreciate some consideration for my feelings if I was being exposed to one."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,danceswithronin,2,Mon Jun 22 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"But small dogs can still cause physical harm and can still bark and get uncomfortably close to someone. It's like telling someone not to be afraid of a scorpion or a black widow just based off of the virtue that the animal is smaller than them. Plenty of girls are afraid of rats or cockroaches and they're easy to fend off, but it's socially acceptable to be scared of them. Be afraid of a much larger, yet still small dog that's supposed to be portrayed as cute/harmless, and people think you're being silly. :/  Understandable- people on different sides of the fence usually have trouble really understanding how the other person may see things. If you can relate to animals easier then more power to you, I get that not everyone is a people person (I am and even -I- find myself hating people sometimes)."

I think they're being pretty silly too. :P I'm coming at it from a very biased angle though - I was NEVER afraid of insects or rodents as a kid, and even went out of my way to seek them out/bring them into the house (to my mother's dismayed horror).    It's like telling someone not to be afraid of a scorpion or a black widow just based off of the virtue that the animal is smaller than them.    Yeah, but these are sensible fears to me because these things can actually hurt you. If you are afraid of a black widow, you have common sense. If you are afraid of a wolf spider, I am a bit less sympathetic to your fear (because they are harmless). Of course people have the equal right to be irrationally afraid of anything they like, be it spiders or goldfish or baby chicks. I just can't relate.    But small dogs can still cause physical harm and can still bark and get uncomfortably close to someone.   My problem with small dogs is that a looooooooooooot of people who have them don't bother to train the damned things (because they're so little a lot of their problem behaviors are ignored or even encouraged(!) because they are considered ""cute"" when the dog is a puppy) and then their dog grows into a fucking terror.   I have smaller dogs - these are mine - but I train them as if they were a hundred and fifty pounds apiece, because no matter what size they are I want to be able to have 100% control over them around other people and animals, all of the time.   People who let their dogs run all over them and terrorize other people because they are little and ""cute"" are shitty dog owners."
AskTrollX,3amrlg,danceswithronin,2,Mon Jun 22 20:01:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'm actually the opposite. I will side-eye a yappy little dog with full intent of punting its bitey-yappy butt over a fence if it gets aggressive with me, whereas I've actually had a full grown (rescue) German Shepherd bite me (like... leaving a slightly gaping wound on the top and bottom of my hand), and I felt no ill will towards it.   The biting wouldn't have happened if there had been more thinking ahead on the human side, and it realized after it bit me that it wasn't supposed to be biting me (...long years of doggy therapy and doggy drugs to get to that point) and went away."

He actually asked his parents to get my address so he could write to me from basic training and when he was deployed overseas. I ignored all of his family's requests for my address, and that was that. Thankfully I moved and only have seen him once since and he didn't see me.

I blamed myself for a long time, because I went to his 21st birthday party and drank a bit. But the more I learned about sexual assault the more I realized it was so not my fault. I really think the only thing that kept me from feeling like absolutely shit was that he only did stuff that had happened while we were dating, which while still not okay, was not as traumatizing as it could have been.  On the plus side after that I connected with one of his best friends who had tried to keep him away from me all night (apparently they knew he was creepin') and we casually dated a few months after that for nearly a year. He was a pastry chef so he gave me delicious desserts. I'm not sure if he really knew what happened.

Ignoring my emotional needs by turning them into being about him. One of my pet rats disemboweled another, and when I called for comfort, I got a nice,  ""They're animals. They do that."" /middle finger emoji.  Cheating on me (I KNOW, I know), and then being secretive about select ""friendships"" he'd make when usually really open about them. Later I found out he'd started dating her while dating me. Oh, and he tried to convince me he ""technically"" hadn't cheated a few weeks later. Nah, son. Just because you can forgive yourself at the drop of a hat.  ""I'm over this PTSD causing event I hurt you with a month ago, why aren't you?"" More or less actual quote.  I had more fun when he wasn't around my friends.  Jealous of me hanging out with male friends, accusing them of wanting to sleep with me, and convincing himself they were all gay.  Being angry at whoever would tell me about his shady shit rather than apologize and mean it.  Threatened suicide once. Oh and yelled at me when id post I was feeling low on my tumblr -- because I wouldn't blame him as the source of my depression.  Forgetting my birthday after three years, and then lying about it. After admitting it.  The lying was what got me. Really lying about a lot of little things, like telling his mom or friends about something shitty he'd do. I assume because he thought I'd tell them?   Was addicted to ADD medication he was buying off his brother. Then got a prescription himself -- which wouldn't have bothered me if he'd been open about it.  Could not take criticism or jokes -- but making them at me was apparently fine. Calling me names in public included, and if I told him I wasn't in the mood to play in that manner, he'd get pissy.  Criticized me and my taste in anything during rough patches -- which were pretty much patches of time where he wanted to pursue other girls and would build up a hate for me.  Found hanging out with me ""tiring"" and seldom wanted to see me.  Talked shit about me to anyone who would listen -- classmates that didn't know me, girls he was interested in, ANYONE.  Didn't want me hanging out with his friends and didn't like mine. He'd openly call them bad influences because, during a period of emotional abuse, I'd be myself rather than how I'd changed to avoid being mad at.  Would be really excited to almost get into fights at work with customers and to call them rude or racist names.  Joined a new gym when his old one was closing -- without telling our mutual, severely depressed friend who used it both as company/support and a way to fight his dismorphia. This mutual friend introduced him to that gym and was his buddy; when he attempted for the third time, my ex was the one person he wanted to see. But nope. Dropped without a word.  Would talk shit about cheaper cars peers and classmates would buy WITH THEIR OWN MONEY AND TIME. Sorry not everyone's parents can buy them brand new cars of their choice and instead have to earn them.  Stole money from his mom to buy shoes. As an adult with a job.

I don't know if you're looking for any other information but if you are making applicators for your tampons, or wings for your pads; better grip for the applicators (that's why I use pearl), and wings that won't break away when I stand after applying, would cause me to buy in bulk immedietly.

I love bikes and fostering a love of bikes, and was just trying to be helpful in pointing out that OP shouldn't be discouraged about the price. In my haste to rattle off a comment quickly on the fly, I wasn't thinking about gender or trying to make any presumptions. I'm not OP and I can't speak for OP, but neither can the people downvoting me for making a careless mistake. If I hurt OP's feelings, then I'm truly sorry and would be happy to apologize to them directly. I've been subbed to this subreddit for a while and I wasn't aware there were any rules about pronoun usage.  Edit: and for what it's worth, people assume I'm male all the time, too. It happens. It doesn't bother me very much, and frankly I'm not enamoured by gender at all, but I acknowledge that other people might be upset about being misgendered on the Internet. I promise that gender was the last thing on my mind when making that comment. I know it's no longer vogue to use male pronouns as neuter in English, and I certainly don't think it should be, but for all intents and purposes you can absolutely consider my use in that comment to be gender neutral."

AskTrollX,3aifcg,JamesTiberiusChirp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad! Hybrids are great for city commuting. I really like Marin's kentfield/larkspur hybrids. They are sturdy bikes and not as expensive as some of the more well known brands (I know with Trek and others you are partly paying for the name brand). But the most important thing about a bike is the fit and comfort. Make sure to go on some long test rides and have someone watch you pedal to fit you -- the old top-tube-at-crotch-height is not a good way to fit a bike. There are a couple of calculators out there where you can put your torso, arm, and leg measurements in separately and it will recommend the right size/geometry. My last bit of advice is that cushy seats and upright riding (think cruiser style) might seem more comfortable, but cruisers will always be heavier and it is actually worse for your back to be upright because when you go over bumps the force goes directly up your spinal column. And cushy seats end up putting more pressure on all the lady bits instead of just the sit/pubic bones, which can cause problems. Good luck!"

I'll be on the lookout for those two hybrids you mentioned, though.   All of the shops do great fittings, and I'm friends with a few bike couriers that can hook me up if I need it.

Looks like they have many iterations of various types of hybrids (enough to be pretty overwhelming, though I guess the city bikes have what looks like road tires with straight handlebars... though they also have a fitness bike, which is the same type of configuration -- try them all out, the actual marketing label doesn't matter so much). Their sub $600 hybrids have shimano named components, so that's nice. If you ever get the chance to try a bike with SRAM components, I really like those too, though they have a double tap gear shift that some people find confusing (I don't, except when I'm switching back and forth between shimano and SRAM I'm always momentarily confused when I can't double tap my shimano). They tend to be lighter and less expensive than shimano, though, which can make the bike less expensive overall while still being of good quality."

AskTrollX,3afv83,neish,19,Fri Jun 19 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I have always gotten a call within about 2 weeks of testing. If they waited 2 months, I can't imagine they found anything that needed urgent attention. Also, if you are young, they may just want to do some follow ups if they found something abnormal, since it is possible whatever is showing up may clear up on its own. Don't stress yourself out too much! The family history likely has little bearing on a pap, since it is a test of the cervix and doesn't really have anything to do with your ovaries."
AskTrollX,3afv83,thisismyown,4,Fri Jun 19 21:38:20 2015 UTC,"This makes me feel better actually. They didn't advise me to not have sex before coming in Monday but I'll abstain for the weekend in case they need to retest. I know intercourse can cause abnormal results if you have sex 24-hrs before.   Still, talk about sending me into a panic. It's really crappy to sit here all weekend and have it in the back of my mind."
AskTrollX,3afv83,koh522,7,Sat Jun 20 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"Doctor told me at the time they'd call within two weeks and if I hear nothing back, it was all good. So why is she having me coming in Monday after over 50 days since my test? My mom has a history of polyps and other issues which caused her to have an ovary removed and a historectomy. I know abnormal results are possible but I'm incredibly scared. Can you guys share your insight?"
AskTrollX,3afv83,KateLovesDanger,15,Fri Jun 19 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"You should address the time frame of the call-back with your doctor, because nearly two months is absolutely unacceptable. That being said, I'm hoping that it's something minor, or even a non-issue that your doc simply wants to talk to you about.  You don't have to be threatening, but you should be calm, firm, and factual about your displeasure of being called nearly two months later when the office policy is two weeks. Your doctor and the office manager need to be made aware of this fact. You don't want to sue, you don't want a free gift card to Starbucks, you just want them to know that it's a blatant violation of office policy and that it's an internal problem they need to address. Then move on."
AskTrollX,3afv83,newheart_restart,2,Fri Jun 19 22:26:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm definitely going to mention my annoyance at the delay but I won't be angry with the doctor or the clinic. It's a sexual health clinic that's runs mainly on volunteers and donations so I don't want to give them a hard time especially because they were so good about getting me in to see the doctor immediately when I had just moved to this province and I have no family doctor of my own. But it's worrying to wait that long to get a call out of the blue and of course they can't offer any information over the phone.

So I was previously in a relationship with this dude, let's call him Kyle, for just short of three years. We loved each other dearly, but he had some issues he was dealing with at the time and decided that it would be best for me if he called it quits. I accepted the breakup reluctantly as I felt like he didn't fight hard enough for the relationship, but I was ultimately okay with a break from him (although I still thought about him quite often). I ended up getting into a new relationship, probably too soon after that one ended, with a new dude. We'll call him Charlie. I really, really like Charlie, but I don't feel quite as romantically attached to him as I did to Kyle. I'm sure it could be attributed to the age of our relationship (just under three months now), but I still think about Kyle every now and again. I figure I'm just not completely over him and that it will come with time.  ...Until a couple of days ago. I got really, really nostalgic for some reason and thought about Kyle a lot. I decided to text him, just to see how he was doing. I knew that he had started dating someone new and it gave me jealous pangs to think about him with another girl. I was super reluctant to talk to him at first, thinking that I would hear all about how happy he was with this new chick and I would just end up upset. But we ended up talking on the phone...and it was actually fantastic. We were both super stoked to be talking again, and as it turns out, he's been thinking of me quite often as well.   A little piece of me wishes there were some way to give Kyle another chance and see what happens, but I can't just dump Charlie. He's so good to me and I know he loves me. Am I being a selfish, horrible person for even considering these things? I need some fucking sense talked into me."
AskTrollX,3afu55,SomniferousSleep,18,Fri Jun 19 20:29:42 2015 UTC,"Kyle is likely to associate you forever with the time in his life when he was dealing with whatever issues he had. That might taint whatever old spark you want to rekindle. And you will always remember how he didn't fight hard enough for you and you may come to resent that later.  It's not worth it, at least not  right now. You both need some time away from each other. Since you both have new people in your lives, please try to let go. It will get easier day by day to think less of Kyle.  And if it doesn't get easier, re-evaluate some months from now. It is way too soon to be deciding anything at the moment.  So do nothing in regards to Kyle right now."
AskTrollX,3afu55,P_Grammicus,2,Fri Jun 19 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty normal, the bad stuff fades, and then if you catch a glimpse of the stuff that drew you to the person In the first place, it can trigger a reaction that is pretty similar to new relationship infatuation.  I think it happens more when the relationship didn't come to a completely natural ending, as you said, you accepted the end reluctantly. Personally I think that recycled infatuation is a terrible thing to base a relationship on or to break someone's heart about, and it has a very high chance of ending in tears for all parties, but that's just because mine didn't work."

A lot of ""student"" card offers you will get in the mail have terrible interest rates and lots of penalties for if you make a mistake. Plan never to use it for a purchase you can't pay off immediately, but also try for one that won't ream you if you do have to put a larger emergency expense on it.

If you can't find one like that right away, open whatever you find first - and when you get a good offer in the mail (because once you start building credit, that'll happen), open that card and switch to that one as your primary card.  I check the balance online a couple times a month and pay it off immediately.  No interest, building credit, and cash back!    (Unsolicited advice: please look up UOP if you haven't done a lot of research on it yet.  I knew a friend who was considering getting her master's through them and one of her friends who worked in HR highly recommended against it because that company wouldn't hire anyone who went there.

You don't get ""huge"" kickbacks for your purchases, but enough tht it's a nice perk. I think the biggest thing is to just not carry a balance on it. Use the card to make a couple regular purchases (bus fare, phone bill, whatever) then immediately pay it off. As long as you don't go on any shopping sprees it'll be fine :)  I was unemployed for a bit, so I did end up using it for some other stuff. It was nice to have it there just in case."

If you're trying to build credit make small purchases and pay it off every month so you don't get in over your head (take it from someone w/ experience!). Use it for like gas or small food purchases. You can also do what /u/lessa795 said and use it for a big purchase, a camera, a designer bag, a new computer, and put the card away until it's paid off. Don't keep it in your wallet if you don't want to use. This is how I do it and it's helped me not make some frivolous purchases."

AskTrollX,3a5xza,xaarlynt,3,Wed Jun 17 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"ALSO for anyone debating getting the arm implant birth control method.. I'd recommend it due to it's success rate (failure rate of 0.05% of pregnancies in perfect and typical use) and as it lasts for 3 years and can be taken out at any time. It doesn't hurt putting in. The worst part is when they inject the lidocaine to numb the arm.  However, do your research and talk to your doctor before making your decision! I'm by no means an expert .. just thought I'd give some of my thoughts on it.  Edit: because I'm dumb."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,pooncartercash,7,Thu Jun 18 00:09:29 2015 UTC,It only prevents 0.05% of pregnancies?! So I'm better off pulling out.
AskTrollX,3a5xza,xaarlynt,3,Wed Jun 17 15:32:57 2015 UTC,LMAO   *failure rate of 0.05%.   I would have never caught mistake on my own. Next time I'll proofread more thoroughly!
AskTrollX,3a5xza,pooncartercash,3,Wed Jun 17 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"I just had my second one removed and my third one put in a few weeks ago. So I've used it for 6 years and am committing to another 3 at the least.  I love it. I recommend it to anybody who listens. I seriously feel like one of those scripted actresses in a birth control commercial.  About it: First of all, it's tiny. It's about an 3 or 4 cm long and 3 mm thick. It's also flexible. It's progesterone only, meaning no estrogen. Estrogen is the hormone that affects some women's sex drive in other birth control pills. I can say I didn't notice a difference when I went on over 6 years ago. Still a horny mother fucker.   The Insertion: The local anesthetic is the worst part. They poke you with a needle to numb you up, and it sucks, but then you're numb, and it's all over at this point. Look away and you won't even know what they're doing. They make a small incision less than a cm long and then push it in with this weird tool. Then they close the incision up with a small bandage and tell you not to take off the bandage for three days.   The Recovery: Once the numbing wears off, the area is sore. I have gotten pretty heavily bruised each time. The first time, it hurt really badly for about a week, and then itched for a month. I think part of the problem was that I was so fascinated by it that I kept poking at it and moving it around through my arm. This last time around it hurt mildly for three days and then was totally fine after that. But I had insane bruise coloring, and I had to awkwardly make up an excuse when people would ask me about it if I raised my arms. This is the worst part, because I'm a terrible liar, and I worry they think I'm hiding domestic violence or something. But I can't go around telling my coworkers about my new birth control implant!  The three years: Well, it lasts a long time, which is great. I don't ever have to think about getting pregnant. I don't ever have to think about birth control. It's also great for party tricks. I can press on it from one end and it kinda pokes from the inside of my skin on the other end. It really creeps other people out, but some people think it's cool. It's painless, and in fact doesn't feel like anything at all.   The only downside: I get anxiety about it in the last 6 months. About 6 months before my first one was supposed to expire, I started getting ovarian cysts. I still don't fully understand if that meant the birth control wasn't affective or what, but my doctor wanted to replace it with a new one to stop the cysts. Sure enough, when I did replace it, I never had another cyst again. That being said, I had a lot of unprotected sex in those months, and I didn't get pregnant. So I'm not sure what the deal was with that.   Pro-tip: wiggle it around in front of your man crush, and if he thinks it's cool then you're gonna get laaaaaid and not get pregnant!"
AskTrollX,3a5xza,barking-chicken,2,Wed Jun 17 20:20:14 2015 UTC,"I also started getting ovarian cysts recently (I'm in the last year before I should get my Nexplanon replaced!) Weird. I had talked with my doctor about getting it replaced but didn't actually go through with it because I assumed my insurance might not cover it. Makes me want to go ahead and ask them about it to find out, if it makes these cysts go away.   I didn't have a period for the first two years with Nexplanon then the cysts & bleeding came back with a vengeance. Glad to know someone else had a similar issue and fixed it!"
AskTrollX,3a5xza,Foreignvertigo,2,Wed Jun 17 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Well I believe under the affordable care act that your insurance has to cover it 100% if you're in the US.
AskTrollX,3a5xza,Foreignvertigo,2,Thu Jun 18 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"Even if it's still technically within it's effectiveness period? My issue is that I had it put in 2 years ago, and it's supposed to last 3 - I'm worried my insurance will decide it's not a necessary thing to cover as it's not expired."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,nukedetectorCA94612,2,Thu Jun 18 03:11:06 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be at most three. That's an important distinction because it may mean you're within coverage. I'd call your doctor and ask them to run your insurance to see what it will cost. It may take a few days for them to do this but it's good info to know! I'm so glad I did it, because I got mine taken out a little bit early because I was feeling anxious about reaching the deadline."

AskTrollX,3a5xza,AstaraelGateaux,2,Wed Jun 17 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"Didn't bleed when I first got it (my bmi is like 18%) and now my period is like Russian roulette every other month or so and lasts for like a day or two. Gives me a bit of anxiety if I'm currently sleeping with someone, but the small period is awesome. I like it a lot, except in extreme temperature changes where you can feel it because it takes longer for it to thermally expand and detract than my muscles/skin/fat take. I recommend it if you're like me and have an irregular work schedule, go backpacking a lot, or are super forgetful. I have had it get caught on rock while rock climbing outdoors before, that was pretty frightening (figured out what was happening before any damage occurred), so I tape my arm down now and it works just fine."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,AlligatorMeat,2,Wed Jun 17 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"I just had mine removed because it was making me suicidal. It's been 24 hours and I'm already starting to feel better.  Nexplanon has the same progestin (etonogestrel) in it as Nuvaring, another form of BC that made me suicidal. I had much better luck emotionally/mentally on the Mirena IUD (levonorgestrel), but unfortunately that gave me horrific cramps.   I believe this is extremely uncommon, but I do want to put the warning out there that if you experienced severe depression on Nuvaring, Nexplanon/Implanon is likely to give you the same symptoms, and you CANNOT remove it yourself.   Apart from the moods, I had the implant for 3 months and was bleeding more often than not (3 weeks out of 4). Full on periods, not spotting. That wasn't fun, either.  Don't let me dissuade you: the implant is more effective than sterilization. The depression side effect is so uncommon that my doctors completely deny it is possible that this or any other birth control could have caused it (although that is a bit ridiculous IMO).   Bleeding issues are common, I'm told, and often take at least a year to stabilize, from what research I've done."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,AstaraelGateaux,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"The depression side effect is not common AFAIK but it is not extremely rare.   There are many threads on the subject and they usually contain cases of women going off the pill to try to conceive or for some other reason, and being surprised to find their mood improving greatly.  Sure that's anecdotal but it is common.    Less commonly I've also seen women reporting an improvement in mood from hormone BC, it is extremely variable."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,helles_belle,2,Wed Jun 17 21:58:06 2015 UTC,"I got Nexplanon inserted this past winter to replace my 3 year old Implanon. For me, it's the best option. No bleeding at all, except a bit of spotting on and off for the first few months. I did have a panic attack thinking about the doc pulling it out and putting a new one in, but that's just my anxiety at work.   I knew the Implanon had worn off when my sex drive shot up to what it was during my teen years pre-birth control, and I started spotting again. That happened about a month before I was due for my replacement, but I went ahead and got that scheduled.   All birth control messes with my sex drive, unfortunately. I've been on several pills, depo for ten years, and now implants. I broke two bones and gained 100 lbs on depo, which is why my doc told me she wouldn't give it to me again and made me choose another alternative.   Hell, I still seem to be gaining weight. I'm starting to put some pressure on the husband to get the old snippy-snip soon. We have a great 6 y/o kid already, and I don't plan on having any more. I'd be thrilled to get my sex drive, complexion, and old figure back in the near future, and all it would take would be a little snip.   I hope my story is a bit of help to you. Take care."
AskTrollX,3a5xza,nsfwhun,2,Tue Jul 7 11:50:20 2015 UTC,"I feel a little bad saying it, but I think I'm one of the exceptionally lucky ones (and cross my fingers that it stays that way); I've had it for a month and a half, too, and I haven't bled at all. I, actually, took a pregnancy test a couple days ago because I was so freaked out by not bleeding. So far I'm really happy with it; I was WAY too forgetful for the pill and was sick of feeling like I was in a constant state of worry that I had messed up my BC and gotten pregnant."

AskTrollX,3a3kwo,firstbaseproblems,3,Wed Jun 17 01:06:03 2015 UTC,I've never had any problem with mine. Look for the lightest colour you can find but with an ash base. Also get yourself a toning shampoo/conditioner to get rid of any brassiness if it happens.  This is just what has worked for me.

AskTrollX,3a3kwo,nsfwhun,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"My advice is to go see a hairdresser. However, if you (like me) hate going to the hairdresser for whatever reason, then get the best quality bleach you can and bleach your hair with that. Get a friend to help you, otherwise you will end up with huge brown patches that you've missed. Make sure you use plenty of conditioner when washing the bleach out of your hair so that you do not damage it.  Then, dye your hair with a blonde dye that best suits your hair colour. I am naturally reddish-brown so I chose a warm, golden blonde.   I'm not responsible if you mess up your hair! I suppose you could always have a box of your natural hair colour at hand in case you really hate it, as long as you don't mind risking the quality of your hair too much haha."
AskTrollX,3a3kwo,NewNavySpouse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Beyond actually bleaching your hair, I highly rec getting a shampoo and conditioner for elderly/silver hair (the kind that comes out of the bottle lavender).  This is a color correcter in case your hair gets brassy after bleaching; this happened the first time I went blond, and might happen to you too, and it was a lifesaver being able to get that red out of the blond :/  Also, you'll want to get different shampoo and conditioner; I'd also suggest getting a dry shampoo, as your hair will be dryer after the bleaching and if you can avoid washing it everyday, that will help a lot.  If you have thin or fine hair, and not a lot of it (like me), then I would get it done the first time professionally (thin hair gets brittle easily)."

Many women will notice a gross whooshing feeling in the morning when they sit up, as all the lining/endometrial tissue/blood that has pooled is suddenly reacting to gravity. If you have an especially light flow, you may not bleed really at all at night.   I'm with team heavy flow, so I definitely bleed at night, but also feel that gross feeling in the morning and have to pray that nothing overflows before I can get to the bathroom. I've got a mooncup now, so that's no longer an issue!"

I've done workouts involving freaking squats after it stops at night but it still never comes back until morning. I cannot find any explanation for this.

It sounds kinda hard to deal with, but it was like the 50s or something in Ireland.   Hmmm, well actually while I've never tried swimming without a tampon during a period I have deffinately tried bathing and that goes..... deffinately period. But it's not exactly clear how much it's just washing off you and how much is coming out new. I'm have a very heavy flow though. The only way I can think to test it is to shower clean, then immediately run a bath. I can test this experiment because at the moment I don't have periods."

Lately I've been thinking of going back to school, because I don't want to be a 24 year old nanny with no degree anymore.   I've already talked to an apartment and have secured that, I've looked into schools and have figured out how to do that as well. Hardest part is trying to talk to my current employers. Any ideas on how to do this as easily as possible?   tldr; need to quit job to move across country for school  ps. any montreal trollxers want to give me some advice! haha"
AskTrollX,3a27ek,perpetuallypeeved,6,Tue Jun 16 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"Are you worried about their reaction? I think that leaving a job to go back to school is really reasonable. If they're good, rational people they may be upset a bit but they will realize that you ultimately have to do what's best for you.   This part is always really scary, but I think it's best to be direct and honest. Give your employer at least two weeks notice (preferably a bit more so they have more time to find a suitable replacement). You don't want to burn any bridges, so if they ask you why you're leaving, be transparent and honest and tell them you'll be going back to school to get a degree. Tell them that you're grateful for the opportunity they gave you and ask them if they'd like you to be involved with informing their daughter. If you've been with her for almost half her life, I'm sure that she's developed an attachment to you and you to her. The Harvard Business Review article on quitting jobs also says ""modest farewell gifts"" are appropriate sometimes too, and I think particularly for a small child that would be a great way to leave (e.g. if she likes stuffed animals, get her a small one to remember you by or something similar, but check with her parents first).   There are a bunch of resources online that give advice on quitting jobs, but as long as you're have a good relationship with your employers and they're reasonable, you should be fine. I hardly think that anyone would expect a young woman in her early 20s to want to be a nanny forever. Just make sure to leave on a good note so you can use them as a reference if need be. Don't stress out over this too much. You'll do great.   Congrats on the adventure!!"
AskTrollX,3a27ek,ravenclawroxy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly suggest you crosspost this to /r/nanny or /r/nannies! They both have great and overlapping communities for nannies and help people figure out how to give notice all of the time!  If you have a contract, look at it to see how much notice is required for you. Otherwise, how much you give is up to you. 2 weeks is standard, but more is a courtesy. If you are concerned they will cut your hours or even fire you the minute you give notice, delay until as close as you feel comfortable to your chosen end date/until your required notice as stated in your contract. The closer to your end date you push your notice the tougher spot you put them in, so be careful with burning bridges if you want them as a reference. If you want to be extra helpful and you feel comfortable doing so, some people will offer to help find and/or train their replacement during their last month or so with a family.  If you have a time you typically talk to your momboss/dadboss about the day, tell them at that point you need to have a deeper discussion with them and give them your notice verbally. If you feel better leaving a paper trail you can have a letter of resignation to hand them after this conversation or send an email following up."

If they are your friends, they'll say, ""oh wow, hey good for you.""  If they consider you less than worth having your own aspirations, they'll say pretty much anything else.

My partner is part of my life, my family are part of my life, they're bound to cross over eventually. He lives with some immediate family members so after the first couple of times I visited they specifically asked if I would say hi to them, so I did (a few weeks since we met). It was just being friendly with people who are around me, from my perspective. My family live further away and distance from m y boyfriend to them is even greater, because two long distances added together. He will likely meet them when I'm on holidays from college because I will have more free time and I want him to meet my family's pets.   For me allowing a romantic partner and family members to meet when their paths cross casually feels way more chilled (but still potentially emotionally meaningful) than keeping them apart, making a big deal of it, and then introducing them over a fancy dinner or something. If they initially get on well after being casually introduced I might suggest an activity together. I watched some stupid tv with boyfriend's mum the other day. His housemate offered to take me out on the his trike and showed me some footage he got of a baby squirrel the other day, it was good bonding (at this pointing dating for several months and have said hi to family and housemates a few times and also accidentally broke their coffee maker and went to shopping with them for food once).

He has been to my house twice, but of course my parents weren't around either time.  My parents are obviously eager to meet him but I don't wanna get into that too early."
AskTrollX,39zwp2,spikypsyche,11,Tue Jun 16 07:00:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say that, once you've reached a point where you both agree that you're after a serious long-term relationship, meeting parents should happen sooner rather than later. Your SO's relationship with your parents, and yours with his, is likely to be a pretty important part of your relationship in the future. Nevertheless, if he's reluctant or super-nervous, you don't need to push him too hard—hopefully there will be plenty of time for them to meet.  Unless your parents are off-the-wall wild or very likely to disapprove of your boyfriend for any reason, I wouldn't worry too much about this meeting."
AskTrollX,39xodr,friendofbettie,12,Mon Jun 15 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"It's not that I can't get along without him here - I'm actually really enjoying the space. (We have spent most of the last two months together due to crazy circumstances.)  But it's like without him here for all the awesome things (snuggles, sex, hanging out, dates, etc) my brain has too much time to think about the things that annoy or worry me. PMS isn't helping. Thankfully I have a therapy appointment tomorrow that probably will.  When I was in a LDR years and years ago, I used to pick fights with that BF before he left town. I think it was easier to be mad than sad. This may be a variation on that experience. Eight days, just have to survive eight more days."
AskTrollX,39xodr,fuschialady,6,Mon Jun 15 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"this happens to me a lot - if I have too much free time, my brain goes to a bad place. But I continually get better.  What helps me is: 1) meditation - it quiets your mind and teaches it to be healthier 2) re-wiring my thought process so that I am more likely to think positive thoughts instead of negative ones (because your thoughts and emotions create your reality ) - I learned this from the anxiety and phobia workbook.  3) Shorter term solutions while you are waiting for solutions 1 and 2 to take effect: distract yourself with hobbies, activities, and friends.  It's harder to  fall into a negativity loop when you are empathizing with your friends thought process or doing something you like."
AskTrollX,39xodr,fuschialady,6,Mon Jun 15 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"I've never been very successful at meditation but I need to keep tring.

AskTrollX,39xodr,candydaze,6,Mon Jun 15 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"meditation and re-wiring your brain is a process that will take probaby 2 months for you to see progress, and like 6 months for you to see significant progress, and still it's ongoing after that.

Barely making rent every month, but expected to basically be on call 24/7. My boss was an absolute nightmare. A total bigoted idiot (and normally I try to not speak so badly of people but...seriously) who would regularly lecture me the latest insane right-wing conspiracy theories (like the government building barbed-wire internment camps for the poor) and the dangers of feminism (she was a FEMALE BUSINESS OWNER. WHAT). Called everything that she didn't like ""gay."" Regularly slapped my ass. Pretended that she had basically saved my life by giving me a job that paid barely over minimum wage and micromanaged every single thing that I did. Refused to listen to me about very obvious problems with the business. Didn't know what a hyperlink was. Would complain when I went to lunch. Snapped her fingers at me. Yelled at me if I needed a question answered, but would also yell at me if I didn't ask her what she wanted done in certain situations. Condescendingly called me ""honey"" and ""sweetie"" and basically treated me like shit all the time. My coworkers hated her too.

But they aren't the ones making your life meaningful, even if it feels like you are nothing without them.

AskTrollX,39td4y,AlterEgo3,11,Sun Jun 14 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"From a girl with waaaayyy too much hair:   Just use the towel to squeeze out the water, pat it down. This cuts down on breakage and static. Then if you can let it air dry partially. The styling benefits of a hair dryer makes the most difference in the final 20% or so. Also, limiting the dryer helps cut down on heat damage and breakage. If you have thin hair, move the hair dryer more from below to give it volume. I know people who blow dry with their head upside down to get volume. If you have thick hair you want to tame down, point the hair dryer downwards, drying your hair from the roots to the ends. Slowly finger comb, or wide comb your hair pulling it straight gently, while continuing to blow dry from scalp to ends. Make sure to get all the hair close to the scalp in the back really dry. If you want some curl, use a round brush. Take a section at a time, curl it up, dry from above while gently pulling the brush down, kind of like a curling iron. As for washing - depends on thickness. No need to shampoo daily unless you have super thin, oily hair. Even then, too much shampooing can strip your hair & scalp of natural oils and then your body starts to over produce oil. I shampoo about every three days, and condition every time I shampoo.  You might be tempted to use just anything to pull it back when it's getting crazy - don't ever use a regular rubber band. Use a clip or a wide hair tie that won't rip your hair.   Good luck! Enjoy!"

AskTrollX,39td4y,AngrilyMenstruating,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Okay question about the whole not shampooing everyday thing:  I have thick, Asian hair. I tried not shampooing for 2 days, and my scalp just felt awful and just felt strange in the shower. Is there some sort of trick to this? I want my hair to be clean but it just doesn't feel clean without shampoo.  Also, I generally wash my hair every other day. If I wait any longer, it starts getting very oily."
AskTrollX,39td4y,gingrrsnap,5,Sun Jun 14 20:50:12 2015 UTC,Changing the spacing if shampooing takes a little bit of time. Your scalp is used to having to over produce oil right now. If it's really bad try some dry shampoo or baby powder to help space it out.
AskTrollX,39td4y,helianto,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"Every body is different - I have super thick hair, and it gets dry and breaks. I also don't use styling gel or spay, just some anti-frizz leave-in conditioner. Usually, I can wait three to four days before it gets that gross feeling. I also usually use Head and Shoulders or a Tea Tree oil based shampoo, at least every other bottle I buy. It keeps my scalp from getting that feeling as well.    If you are fine washing it every other day, and it's not breaking or getting dry, that's cool. Maybe that's just what you need. I just know that if you shampoo too much you can over-dry your scalp, then your body can start to produce more oil, then it becomes a vicious cycle.   One trick I know can help is putting some baby powder on the scalp and then brushing it through. You have to do this lightly, otherwise it can make your hair look grey and if you have black hair that might be pretty obvious. Just take a small amount of powder and start working it into your scalp, then brush it out and style normally."
AskTrollX,39td4y,kaunis,6,Mon Jun 15 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"Howdy!  I started growing out my hair 7 months ago and it's longerish (side shot of hair, what I've been doing with my hair recently).  I used to have short hair (think buzz cut) so I'm at a total lose of how to take care of my hair.  Shampoo, conditioner, gels, combs, and blowdryers are mixed up in this.  My normal routine is add shampoo, lather my hair with said shampoo, and then rinse shampoo out of my hair immediately. Every other day I use conditioner. After I have shampoo'd my hair I add conditioner and let it sit in my hair for 2-5 minutes before I rinse ~95% of it out of my hair.  When I'm done showering I use one towel to dry my body and another for my hair (two towels is amazing). I rub the towel around my head vigorously till my hair is mostly dry.  Blowdryers? how do they work? I turn it on and point it my head while running a comb through my hair till it's more dry. I like this because it gives my hair a more uniform coverage (instead of grooves from the comb tooth) and helps with my cowlick.  What am I doing wrong? How and when should I be using gels? Are there guides for this stuff.   Thanks TrollXers"
AskTrollX,39td4y,spacetimesix,3,Sun Jun 14 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"Using the towel in a vigorous way can create serious frizz so if you ever feel you have frizz issues that could be it.   As far as blow drying your hair you're supposed to use it on low and for volume use a roll brush while drying it. For hair that short though and if you're not going for volume you can continue with the comb I think. Keeping it on low reduces damage and frizz as opposed to high but it does take a lot longer.   Here's a guide I found for gels vs creams vs fibers etc. I think what you're going for is the fiber but hey, experiment!"

Or do I just start in with the blow dryer? Won't that take forever, especially on a low setting? Help, I am also new to long hair!"
AskTrollX,39td4y,kaunis,6,Sun Jun 14 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I've read that using a T-shirt to dry your hair instead will help with frizz. I have super short hair though, so frizz isn't an issue for me."
AskTrollX,39td4y,spacetimesix,4,Sun Jun 14 19:16:59 2015 UTC,It will take a long time - I actually second the t shirt thing. I started using t shirts and it did cut down on frizz BUT it's also awesome because it wraps around your head perfectly. I put my head through the neck and then bring it back up and wrap my hair in the body of the shirt. It's so comfy and a lot lighter than a whole towel.   With air drying your mileage may vary. If I let mine air dry for even a second it starts to get wavy and if I'm not going for wavy that day and I blow dry it too it just looks super weird.   Definitely try the t shirt thing. I have dedicated hair t shirts and just treat them as a towel with laundry and keep them in the towel closet.   Also I saw your bit about shampooing. I have SUPER thin hair. I tried washing it every other day for three months and it just did not look good on the non shampoo days. Some people can get away with washing it every other day or even just once a week. Try to cut down and see what works.

AskTrollX,39rqha,PiperLenox,8,Sun Jun 14 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"Use picture ledges to be able to display framed pictures, books, small posters, other art, etc. in a way that puts minimal holes in the wall, and is maximally interchangeable. If you have any books with particularly pretty or interesting covers, this is a way to turn them into decoration instead of obscuring them on a traditional bookshelf.  If you have a window you'd like to sit by, turn a sturdy, small bookshelf like IKEA's Kallax 3-by-2 shelf sideways and put a cushion on it - shelving and a window seat!  You could also consider, particularly if you don't have a lot of space, using some sturdy shelves like that as a bed frame. It would probably require some minor handy skills, but if you don't have them personally, I bet someone you know does. You could even consider putting the shelves as a frame, and then laying a plank on top of it with hinges on one end and a small handle on the other, so you could lift up the part where your mattress is and use the inner, hidden part as a place to store lesser-used things, like your winter coats and boots during the summer, or stuff like that.  Utilize your vertical space! Line your wall (or all your walls!), about a foot or foot and a half below the ceiling with shelves. If you want to use them for things you'll access fairly frequently, tuck a folding step stool behind your desk or in your closet or something."

AskTrollX,39nlz7,Bannedfromfun,2,Sun Jun 14 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"It's more that you're losing it consistently, every month,  and a lot of people just don't have a diet high in iron. And by the time you hit stage 3 you've already lost the blood (and iron) so you're still going to feel tired.

All I can say is to keep hydrated if you're throwing up frequently, and if it continues go see a doctor  because they can diagnose you.  I realize now my phrasing in the previous post was poor, common causes of fatigue during menstruation is because you're losing a lot of iron and might have low ferritin levels. The potassium is just kind of a side note, it helps with cramping so it's a good idea to make sure you're eating foods high in it.

First: If you are feeling jealous ask yourself some questions surrounding that jealously. Like:   Is this something you want or do you just want the attention/accolades that come from it? If you DO want it, can you obtain it?    2B. If you can't or don't want to obtain it, is there something in your life that is lacking? Does what this person has/projects showcase something you desire (power at work, leadership, more leisure time, etc)    What can you do help boost yourself up a bit? Get refocused at work, volunteer, start exercising a little each day, try to break up your routine sometimes?   Something else to keep in mind is to admire that person, celebrate them and use them to help keep youself moving forward. So what if they're presenting their ""best selves"", what's stopping you from celebrating that with them? Surrounding yourself with supportive people who are positive influences and forward movers in life is really important!   I get jealous of friends who work in Vegas as drink girls and work 20 hours a week, making a few grand a shift. They travel the world, are scary-hot, and have tall-ass heels. But then Im like, wait! They're my friends so that's cool and I wasn't born to be scary-hot, I am not ready for all that body maintainence, I hate tall-ass heels AND I am not even really interested in that life but it looks awesome. So go them! Im glad I can at least take it all in!  We should all be celebrating each other and supporting one another. Learn, grow, and build together.   Look, our lives are different. They move at different paces on different paths. You can bump yours along in various ways but it will still never look exactly like anyone else's life."

But I still find myself comparing my life to that of my friends (I'm not married/with a SO/in a ""good"" job) or the people I meet (You've volunteered at how many clinics??/You've hitchhiked for how long??). I've gotten pretty upset about it in the past. But something I've been consciously noticing is how DIFFERENT everyone is, and how awesome I think that is!! I'm currently travelling, and I meet people who never get 12 feet off their bus and people who have been walking trails since December. And they all look different and have different accents and it's all totally fine, and they're all really awesome?? It's been helpful to remember that I don't need to fit a mold - hard to remember, though.   Also something else that helps is when I look at my friends/other people who are my age and ""more successful"" is remembering that I don't want to peak at my current age - I want to continuously grow and improve my life. I don't want perfection when I'm young, I want to mess up and figure it out and fix it, so I know how to handle adversity and sadness and loneliness.

But the other day I realized that, even with my perceived-to-be-too-low salary and overall lifestyle, I am in the top 1-2% of the world's population. I am in a demonstrably better position than over seven billion people. And yet, I spend all my time wishing and dreaming of being in the top 0.1%, and beating myself up for not having achieved it. I don't need to reach the pinnacle... I'm already there.  When I think about what makes me unhappy or unsatisfied about my life, for the most part it's only guilt about not having achieved what other people think it the maximum of my potential.

Cuz otherwise, posting that in a public forum is just straight bitchy.  I think either way I'd probably respond with ""ha ha, I know, right?  Some people are just so self involved.""

I agree that we can't have governments deciding that books cannot be published b/c they have scary or offensive ideas contained within.  But I've noticed that there's a growing group of people who use this idea as the reason that one can never be offended, that being offended ever, by anything is somehow both parochial & dictatorial.    There are many things in our world that we should all be fucking offended about.  I am offended when people make casually racist jokes (or any racist jokes obviously), not only because racism is morally wrong, but because racist attitudes have a very real effect on our country, & on individuals.  Confronting that shit matters & I won't be shamed into silence by people lacking the ability to empathize with anyone not exactly like them."

Your aunt may not be aware that at the center of the Earth is the core, which is made up of two layers, the outer core (which is from 1,790 to 3,160 miles deep) and the inner core (which is from 3,160 to 3,954 miles deep, 3,954 miles being the radius of the planet).   The outer core is so hot due to pressure and friction that iron and nickel are partially liquified. And it has currents. The nickel iron fluid's movement is widely believed to be responsible for part of Earth's magnetic field, which protects us and everything we'll ever know from dangerous solar radiation. The temperature is theorized to be as high as 10,340°F at some places.   The inner core is also incredibly hot due to extreme pressure and friction, however it's under so much pressure that it's solid. Imagine iron and nickel that are so hot that their temperature rivals the surface of the sun, but it's under so much pressure that it can't become liquid. And not only might it be growing, it might be spinning at a different rate than the Earth!   Only one other major body in the solar system is thought to have a molten core which produces a magnetosphere like ours, and that would be Jupiter's moon Io. It's possible that some day humanity will be able to colonize, terraform, and live on Io.   Suddenly picking on your niece for caring about stuff doesn't seem all that important."

AskTrollX,39kn56,xombem,23,Sat Jun 13 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"Anything by Lelo. I have the Ina and the Smart Wand. They're rechargeable (no buying batteries EVER and no cord keeping you strapped to the wall), silicone, waterproof, have lots of different settings to keep it interesting, and the company offers a one-year manufacturing warranty AND a ten-year quality guarantee where if your toy poops out outside of the warranty period, you can get your next toy for half off.  If the price tags scare you away (MSRP is typically at least $100 for most models), you have a couple of options.    Check out Amazon. My Ina retailed for $150, but I got her for $75 on Amazon. Free two-day shipping with Prime :) Check out Lelo's more basic line, Picobong. They're not all rechargeable, but they offer similar toys for slightly more modest prices (and in brighter colors)!   (So I just realized that this comment reads like a fucking sales pitch...I promise I'm not being paid by any of these companies, I just really like their products :/)"

Both great, but the Gigi is now mainly a backup or anal toy for me because the Ina 2 is powerful and amazing. They are higher end price-wise, but they're worth it. The feel of the material used is luxurious, it feels great against your body.  I recommend them to everyone.     I second Amazon for them. Make sure to check the color options, I wad able to get a lime green toy for much cheaper than the more popular pinks and purples."
AskTrollX,39kn56,lovekeepsherintheair,2,Fri Jun 12 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'll second the recommendation that Picobong is definitely pretty decent, especially for tighter budgets - the material they're made from is nice, the colours are fun and they seem pretty reliable BUT I recommend you keep an eye on the battery cap before buying one. I don't recall what model I have but the cap has only a slight twist holding it on and it's very easy to knock open. Like... frustratingly easy. In fact that's probably something to consider no matter what brand you're buying."

It is super quiet unlike the hitachi. It oscillates (goes back and forth) instead of just vibrating all over the place which caused my bits to become numb while using other devices. No numbness with the Eroscillator. Seriously look into this. I have had mine for almost 8 years now and it is still going strong despite being dropped off a dresser and getting a crack in it. It is the greatest investment I have ever made. Great to use with a partner or solo. Much less cumbersome than the hitachi. Oh and it uses electricity instead of batteries so you can always use it (unless the power is out, I guess.) No fumbling around for new batteries in the heat of the moment. Much more economical. The cord is extra long too. I have never had a problem with it and highly recommend."

(For the sake of this conversation, please no sorrys, this isn't about me.) Anyway, I know that feeling of wanting to belong and feel accepted by those around you. I know that we've been taught our whole lives that we're nothing without a man by our side and how hard it is to not expect Mr. Right to just fix everything for us. I know the hurt when we see those couples on Facebook who look so perfect and happy together and wonder what they did in life to deserve happiness through another.  But guess what? The people who expect too much out of you will always expect too much out of you. If you do get married within their expected time slot, its ""When can we expect kids from you?"" ""You guys are having problems? It must be all your fault.""  Mr Right won't fix all your problems. He won't see you across the street one day, decide you're the women of his dreams, sweep you off your feet and ride you both off into the sunset. Mr. Right is your best friend who you also happen to fuck even on that one day were you guys got hot and bothered on the couch binge watching something on Netflix and before the deed, you laid down a towel and took your tampon out real quick.   And those couples on Facebook? Don't you wonder why they spend so much time taking pictures of themselves and not spending all that time just being with each other? Why do they feel the need to constantly validate their relationship online anyhow? Who. Fucking. Cares.   Anyway, the whole point of this rant was to just say that sometimes, we can't please everyone on the planet by conforming to what the movies say about how life should be. You do you, booboo.

For me, personally, it's too much of a gamble whether I'd like it or not, for the same reasons you mentioned in another comment. I think it's a very realistic way of reasoning, which more people should have. Kids are much less fun and games as most people think.   Also to answer your OP question: I chose to work part time and live a modest, but good life. My money worries possibly are higher than most people but my overall stress level is way lower and that's worth it. You don't háve do go the mainstream way.

AskTrollX,39h23z,squeakyrobot,7,Fri Jun 12 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"Being a student was the worst. Okay, not really and not all the time. It has its advantages and disadvantages just like any other time of your life. You can party harder but you kinda have to because you have very little free time. You're fucking poor. There's a lot of pressure to make decisions that will supposedly affect the rest of your life but once you're done, you'll realize how little some of those decisions matter. I mean, you won't become a doctor if you don't go to medical school but no one cares what electives you took or what your grades were (beyond getting into graduate school).  Hobbies are hobbies, right? They're supposed to be things you love to do so making time for them kinda comes naturally. And if you have kids, you can share those hobbies with them--a kind of two-for-one deal. After the first years where, yes, you have to give your hobbies up for a little bit.  I was honestly kind of amazed by how much free time I had once I was done with school and in my career. I work 40 hours a week--that's it! There's no homework, no tests to study for. I put in my time and I go home. I know some people work longer hours--hey, you've got to strike the kind of work-life balance that works for you. Some people consider work their hobby too and that's okay to a point. It's not my work-life balance but it works for some people.  As far as finding someone to spend your life with...man, that's a big question. There's no great, perfect answer for that one. The more people you expose yourself to the better your odds, I guess. People looks for companionship in lots of different ways.  As far as affording it all...make a budget and stick to it. It's easier said than done for sure though."

Last year we spent two weeks driving more than 4,000 miles around the U.S. I saw the Milky Way with my bare eyes for the first time ever. We got to experience some of the most beautiful sights together. It was awesome.  For the past year or so, I've felt increasingly bored in my free time. I have some hobbies but I'm even bored of them. I'm looking forward to my first child being born because I'll definitely never be bored again. I was undecided on kids until about two years ago when I really started wanting them. Now I'm 37 weeks pregnant and overjoyed about it.  I've very much a make it up as you go along kind of person.

AskTrollX,39h23z,paroxyst,3,Fri Jun 12 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I gotcha. Well, I'm 30 and just getting started with the whole having kids game. My husband is 36.  While there is evidence that women's fertility suffers a dip after 35, it's been shown that it's not the hard cliff dive that's been more popularly reported. The risk of miscarriage and chromosomal problems goes up, but they can do early testing for abnormalities which gives women some options (not ideal choices, of course).  No, women’s fertility doesn’t ‘drop off a cliff’ at 35, Washington Post  Unless you're already over the age 40, it's highly likely that you still have time. And even if you are, there are still options for conceiving at an advanced maternal age. Adoption also remains an option.  I do understand the fear though. We had to wait until my husband was finished with grad school and the whole time I wondered about my own fertility even though I was still in my 20s. It's an unknown that can become a heartbreaking reality. I had a miscarriage our first try but thankfully we were successful after that (at least so far...ugh, so many things to worry about while you're pregnant!).  Unfortunately we cannot predict how our lives will go. I hope you end up getting all the things you want out of yours though :)"
AskTrollX,39h23z,NewNavySpouse,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:24:44 2015 UTC,"that makes sense, but I mean....don't you have to decide whether or not you want kids before you get married to avoid divorce?   I think that my main problem is that I dont want them now in particular, but I worry that I will like turn 40 and realize that I made the wrong decision or feel like there's a hole in my life. I feel like having kids is insurance against being alone in your old age.  No one told me that you cant predict or control your life - I feel like we are told a lie that if you work hard and plan or something you will get everything you want, but you can't.  You can't predict how your life will go and that's terrifying.    ahhh maybe I should compromise and marry a guy who already has a kid or something lol :/"
AskTrollX,39h23z,NewNavySpouse,2,Fri Jun 12 13:32:04 2015 UTC,"My husband and I weren't sure if we wanted kids or not. He started wanting them before me but I never felt pressured to join the ""pro kids"" team. I think he would've been happy either way, honestly. But now that I'm pregnant, he's overjoyed too. (It's adorable.)  So, no...you don't have to know that for sure. The best thing you can do is just be honest with your partners so they can decide if not having kids is a risk they want to take to be with you.  As a woman, you do have the option to get pregnant on your own using donor sperm. Some women do this because they don't want to wait around for a partner or because they're getting older and want to begin a family. There are a lot of reasons women have to do it this way... that's not to say you have to. Being a single parent is hard no matter the circumstances but it is still an option.  And there are guys out there with kids already so that is another option for sure.  So much is about prioritizing, I guess. Kids were not on my priority list until I hit about 27-28. My early 20s was about finishing school, getting some kind of job that didn't make me hate myself. My mid and late 20s was about having fun and enjoying time with my husband. The very last couple of years was about my husband finishing graduate school. Then we toddled along until he could find full time employment. Now it's about raising kids...well, kid. I still don't know if it's the right time but we're doing it anyway.  Kids don't really insure that you won't be alone in your old age, btw. When I was in high school, I worked at Goodwill and met an amazing 92 year old woman who shopped there regularly. She looked fantastic, no where close to her age. She lost her husband and her only child like 60 years earlier in a car accident. She never remarried, never had anymore kids. She ballroom danced, though...that was her hobby. She made the most out of what her life became and despite her tragedies, she was happy."

AskTrollX,39h23z,gyffyn,6,Fri Jun 12 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"Getting married doesn't mean an end to hobbies, and neither do kids. You have to work around them, and you might have to put them a little on hold, but it's do-able. And it is ABSOLUTELY possible to save for retirement, raise kids and buy a house (listen to Dave Ramsey if you don't believe me), but it doesn't just happen all on its own (like a lot of people seem to be suggesting). You make a plan and a budget and you STICK TO IT. And you save that money you make early on, so you can buy that house and raise those kids the way you want to; you don't just spend it all on ""hobbies"".   Now, if you make $50k a year, do you get to travel the world every year and live in a $300k house and raise 5 kids? No, no you do not. But you can save for retirement, travel here and there, and live in a decent house with a few kids.   I actually recommend Dave Ramsey, at least for a little while. He can get a bit ranty (just skip those bits), but the debt-free screams are inspiring, and people call in all the time making ok money with fantastic retirement plans. Live on less than you make; save the rest. Don't ever, ever, ever go into debt unless it's to buy a house. Ever. That's just an anchor around your neck that will prevent you from doing all the things you want to do.   Yes, you have to seek out like-minded people, but there are tons of ways to do that. College, is one. As your friends go off and do their lives, you can visit them, meet their new friends, learn new things from each other. You can meet your neighbors (take them cookies when you move in), you can join a meet-up, you can check out events from your local library (I'm going to two this summer, at least). Meet people at the dog park (if you have a dog; otherwise it's creepy). Join a kickball league, go dancing, join a biking group. Whatever you like to do, go do it! That's how you'll meet like-minded people.   Oh, and go scrape up $60 and buy YNAB, or learn the Dave Ramsey Baby Steps and start using Everydollar.com for free. A budget will save you SO MUCH heartache and pain and anxiety and fear."

I never should've met my boyfriend when I met him.  I never should've reconnected with him, either.  (It's a long story.)  And we're so like-minded it's weird.  I mean, we're similar in how we want to sleep, how we like to spend our free time, what we want in the future.  We even have similar histories and think the same way.  So I think in general, yeah, you have to seek out like-minded people.  But sometimes you just kind of stumble upon someone who might be perfect for you.

They were born into poor families (and didn't understand college was an option because no one talked about it in their schools or families).  My parents often worked multiple jobs each, just to keep our heads above water.  They had a special needs child in their early 20s and fought hard to get him the help he needed (and they ultimately failed).  Between trying to help him, trying to keep me safe from him, and trying to pay rent and buy food... there was no way for them to figure out a way to make their lives better.

AskTrollX,39h23z,MonsoonAndStone,5,Fri Jun 12 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do for yourself is to put off marriage and kids until later in life. Back in the day, a mailman could afford to buy a house and raise 8 kids with a SAHM. Now, a person basically has to make 6 figures to do that comfortably without sacrificing something. Depending on where they live, of course.   Learn how to save and budget now, set up a savings account now, figure out where you want to be and how much that will cost now. If you have a plan, it will be easier to make things happen.   That said, life doesn't ever line up the way you expect it to. People get through things by doing the best they can with what they have. Be the person you would want to marry, not some faux unrealistic vision of a ""good wife/husband"" prototype. And it's okay if you're not married right after you graduate, or in 10 years from now. The only time limit you have is the one you give yourself.   You do have to put in a little bit of effort, but imo, the best relationships happen when you're not trying too hard. You can come off as desperate, and desperate is the biggest turnoff.   Go out and do things you like, go on field trips, make friends. Maybe the cute guy you met hiking isn't really your type, but his super awesome cousin/brother/friend you meet at a barbecue might be your future husband."

Really, find a good job you won't need to do over time in, live below your means and only have as many kids as you can handle and afford. You can get a baby sitter and have time with your husband, and still go out. You don't need a big wedding no sense in starting a marriage out in debt, aside from student loans.  Really it's so much easier then what I've seen but I've watched a lot of people around me suffer. My parents bitched about it a lot. My husband and I get bills and I just shrug and in my head I go ""we got it, all good"" it's part of living below your means. It was hard the first few months but right now, it's so easy. We aren't having kids for at least 4 years but even then it'll be one at a time and years apart so we can budget apporiately. It seems all crazy but it really isn't too bad. The most stressed I get is when rent is due and when I don't hear from my husband when he is gone.

I am currently living with my boyfriend, who was my long distance SO while in college, and unemployed, studying for the GRE and trolling reddit.  I met him through my best friend, so this sort of ties into your ""find someone to marry"".  I do not intend to get married, but I am very glad I found someone to share my life with.  I think when it comes to relationships, you find people who share interests with you by meeting them like I did, through friends, or in places you spend time - a la, your interests.  So, if you participate in local theater, you're going to meet people who also enjoy doing that.  You love books?  Chances are you'll run into someone in the bookstore who also loves books.  You can take a more direct approach like joining a dating site, but I think life will introduce you to people in its own time.  But basically.... Don't stress that your life isn't as great as other people's.  It's your life.  Do what makes you happy.  Enjoy the time you have.  Spend time with people you love.  Eventually, you'll find some path or direction."

AskTrollX,39hxte,leokat,17,Thu Jun 11 20:56:30 2015 UTC,I believe it will be less heartbreaking to explain your choice to them now instead of explaining to them under the spectre of dishonesty discovered.
AskTrollX,39hxte,KeyBanger,2,Thu Jun 11 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards telling them, but every time I drop a hint, their reactions push me in the other direction :/"
AskTrollX,39hxte,octobrrr,18,Thu Jun 11 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"Your mother locked herself in her room and cried all night over the mere suggestion that you and your bf share a room with separate beds?!  This emotional blackmail (because that's what it is, let's call a spade a spade) is every shade of wrong.  You aren't a child, you're 25 for crying out loud, you can live with whoever you want and have sex swinging from the rafters if that's what floats your boat.  Your parents need to respect you as an independent adult and not as their baby."
AskTrollX,39hxte,octobrrr,2,Thu Jun 11 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"It may very well be emotional blackmail, but I feel like it was just a strong emotional reaction (I've had a great many strong emotional reactions myself, it must run in the family). It doesn't add up to me why this is something she is so emotional about, but I hesitate to dismiss her emotions as invalid. Her feelings aren't going to stop me from doing what makes me happy, but I would hate to see what this news would do to her. On the other hand, I feel like telling the truth is just the right thing to do. I guess it comes down to a choice between honesty and kindness. I'm not sure which I value more!"
AskTrollX,39hxte,misyo,2,Fri Jun 12 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"From an outsiders' point of view (so feel free to take this with a shovel of salt), it looks like they've had years of practice of having extreme emotional responses to your possible choices.    I recently asked my dad what he would think if my bf and I lived together if we got engaged (we are not engaged), and he said it would kill my mother, and he would not be happy.  See, this is what sets my hackles up.  Your parents should be encouraging you as you pursue adult life and all its challenges, not using emotional threats and guilt tripping you (""it would kill your mother"") at any hypothetical suggestion.  I think honesty is the best policy, but prepare yourself for the guilt tripping and hysterical reactions that may come your way.  Be strong and do not back down."
AskTrollX,39hxte,A_Walled_Garden,13,Sun Jun 14 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"You are an adult and you can make decisions for yourself. What you want to do is not outrageous or harmful. You moving out with your boyfriend is something your parents have to deal with as adults and they should be excepted to understand that you are an adult and are capable of making your own decisions. If your parents get upset, that is on them and it's their issue to work through.   Hiding it from them also diminishes your position by somehow implying it's wrong. It's not- it's your choice."
AskTrollX,39hxte,deme9872,10,Thu Jun 11 21:22:15 2015 UTC,"Backstory: After college I moved back in with my parents, and we have a great relationship. I think they're awesome, but they are extremely traditional. I am constantly surprised by just how traditional. For example, when I was 20, my then bf was coming with us to a rented beach house, and I suggested that we sleep in a room with two twin beds--my mom locked herself her bedroom and cried all night. For suggesting that we sleep in separate beds in the same room!!   I recently asked my dad what he would think if my bf and I lived together if we got engaged (we are not engaged), and he said it would kill my mother, and he would not be happy.   We are moving several states away, so we wouldn't have to worry about them randomly dropping by.   I don't want to kill my parents, but on the other hand, I don't want to lie to them. I'm 25 years old, and I'm over lying to my parents like a teenager. What do you guys think?  EDIT: I don't know what I expected...of course I SHOULD tell them! I'm still conflicted though....shielding family members from the truth is pretty much a family tradition."

AskTrollX,39hxte,A_Walled_Garden,8,Fri Jun 12 12:52:18 2015 UTC,"You're an adult. Are you willing to let your parents make your decisions for you at age 25? Because that's kinda how this is ringing. You gotta do you. Don't lie about it. Calmly and logically explain why you're doing it, explain that it's time for you to be an adult and make your own adult decisions. Relationships have changed, how they progress has changed, hell, even the economy has changed to a point where living separately until marriage just isn't always feasible. Especially in a situation where you will be moving states away from them.   Tell them you love them and admire their relationship and how it started/progressed, but that you and your bfs relationship is NOT theirs. You are not them."

AskTrollX,39hxte,Lilusa,3,Fri Jun 12 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"Tell them.    I would wait to tell them until you're actually in the act of moving out so you're not stuck dealing with their guilt-tripping or other shenanigans long-term.    But tell them.  They will probably be upset at first.  But they will get over it eventually.    And if they don't get over it eventually, you have some solid information about what type of people they are.  You're not obligated to be close with your parents just because they're your parents.  If they're not going to love you unconditionally you don't have to love them unconditionally.    Once you move away, and once you see how they react to this, you can make the decision on how involved you want to allow them to be (or not) in your life.  Hopefully they pleasantly surprise you by ultimately being fine with the move.    Plus, carrying out an elaborate ruse will likely stress you out in the long run.  The specter of them finding out is going to hang over you until it happens.  And if they ever want to come visit you're going to have to go to sitcom levels of ridiculousness to hide the fact that the two of you live together.  And when they do ultimately find out you'll have to deal with the double whammy of them being upset about you living with your boyfriend (which is not all that reasonable) and with them being upset about you lying to them (which is more reasonable).  Easier to just deal with the first one.    And ultimately, even though they act like it will, finding out that you're living with your boyfriend is not going to kill them.  They will live.  You will live."
AskTrollX,39hxte,Lilusa,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about having them disown me, or stop loving me; they've definitely made it clear in the past that they do love me unconditionally. However, this is something that for whatever reason, is extremely important to them. I think it's ridiculous, but to them, living together before marriage is completely unthinkable. It wouldn't just be something they'd be angry about, it would devastate them.   I feel like the noble and mature thing to do is definitely to tell them. I really want to be honest with them. But I don't know if that would be the kind thing to do. Is it really worth it?   You're right though, it is stressing me out already! Ugh, I have so many other things to worry about before we move; I wish this wasn't one of them."
AskTrollX,39hxte,deme9872,2,Fri Jun 12 11:30:43 2015 UTC,"Extreme honesty might work in this situation. Tell them you're planning on moving in together but you've thought about lying and making up elaborate schemes because they've made it too scary to be honest with them. Maybe if they knew how their reactions were affecting you, it might bother them. It should bother them.   My parents are the same way and I think it would hurt them more that I'd rather them not be a part of such a big important part of my life than to just break some outdated tradition."

It's fine to have and express preferences, but to demand you keep it completely bare down there is pretty extreme. I don't mind keeping things trimmed, but I don't think I'd ever shave down there for a guy, primarily for comfort reasons. I tried shaving just to see what it's like... never again. I wasn't even able to get a clean shave there. For some reason the closest I can get is stubble, which is horrible for many obvious reasons.   I know it shouldn't be a big deal   But it's a big deal to you, and that's completely normal. It's a big deal to a lot of women for many aesthetic, comfort, and health reasons. He should respect that and be willing to compromise. I'm not crazy about my boyfriend's beard and I might express that to him one day when we're more settled into the relationship, but I would never demand he shave if it made him uncomfortable because I respect his feelings and his autonomy."

We also scheduled things that we used to not have to; sometimes physical intimacy we'd set for a certain day (obviously not pressuring each other, but then we'd be prepared), trying to choose a night we could play a board game or go on a walk, trying to keep our own sleep schedules contained so we could wake up and catch each other now and then.  It's important to be patient when you guys are tired; this was a big issue for me and my SO.  We'd both be exausted at different times, so don't put too much emphasis on complicated conversations (and always appreciate the listening).   Also, sleeping next to each other when you have the time is nice, but don't be afraid to sleep in other rooms now and then if rest becomes an issue. Share movies and shows that you both like, so when the other isn't free, you can have something to talk about later (and watching something that your partner suggests helps you feel closer to them)."

Do new things. Find people you can talk to- online, or friends or family. People that understand or at least help you feel better. If you like art things, try new stuff. I know it sounds cheesy, but I'm really into crafts stuff, but I'm not very creative. I go on pinterest, find something I think is cute and try to make it.   It keeps my head and my hands busy. It gives me something to be proud of. And, if I fuck up and end up trashing my project, that's alright. I tried. And I did something.  Stuff like that. Talking about it really helps. Working on things. All that sort of stuff.   If you wanna talk, feel free to PM or comment back. Good luck. Lots of people struggle with this. You're not alone. Good luck, OP. <3"
AskTrollX,39dgy0,SchadSchad,3,Thu Jun 11 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"Fake it till you make it! I've been depressed for 23 years, no lie. Three years ago I finally got the proper diagnosis. I have Bipolar Disorder and to top it off I also have OCD. Fun stuff. It gets really tiring to put on the face. I do two things, first and most important I take time for myself. I give myself time to be away from people. Second I have made my mental health a top 3 priority in my life. My family and my business round out the 3. Some days they're in different orders. I have recognized that it is a full time job for me to keep me healthy."
AskTrollX,39dgy0,igardenalot,3,Thu Jun 11 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"Things that help:   therapy. Not any therapy, but the one that fits you, and your needs.  drugs. Not any drugs, not always, and not flippantly, but drugs are a tool, and tools are useful herbal aids. St. John's Wort, passionfruit flower, lavender, chamomille. And even the ritual of stopping, brewing, and sipping a cup in peace. They're not going to cure, but they can help EXERCISE. every day. Doesn't matter what. Doesn't have to be exhausting or unpleasant or boring. Dance like a drunk monkey naked in your living room, if that's what works for you. don't put on a face. your face is not there for other people's entertainment."
AskTrollX,39dgy0,pusheen_the_cat,2,Mon Jun 15 08:18:41 2015 UTC,"Medicine helps (but talk to a doctor about that). I have clinical depression and I do something for myself every now and then, like get an expensive meal or buy that thing I've been wanting. Exercise helps. Hobbies help. Working helps. Anything to revert your focus away from your mind and have a positive outcome."
AskTrollX,39dgy0,dirty_harriet,2,Thu Jun 11 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't cope well.  At my worst, I just did the minimum necessary to survive and locked myself away from people besides that because it was just so exhausting.  I had a good 10+ years of clinical depression myself.  What helped, to a certain extent, was my internet social network.  Not like Facebook - that wasn't a thing when my depression was at it's worst.  I was involved with a gaming clan and I had some people I got close with, a couple people I could confide in - and people I helped through their own problems.  At a time in my life when I felt like most people were relatively happy, it helped me to know that there were others out there who were struggling.  It helped, feeling useful.  It helped having people I could talk to, simply because I couldn't say things to people I knew in real life because I was always scared of the pity/annoyance that would show on their faces.  (That said, if you ever need to just get something off your chest and you want a stranger to listen, I'm here.  You can send me a PM.)  I hope you eventually break through the fog <3"

Get out and do something, a new hobby, a sport, a club, a field of study, just go do something else. I picked up rock climbing, it is my own personal therapy and has been for about 8 years now. When I am on the verge of a total breakdown that I know will keep me doing nothing for days, I get up off my ass and go to the climbing gym and I boulder by myself for hours. You can become so absorbed in something else that it takes your mind off of the other things you worried about. Plus, a sport will help because it also releases endorphins, for me climbing is excellent because it is a full-body exercise in problem-solving. Your mind is focused on what you are doing and you are engaging all of your muscles as well. I have yet to find anything else that does this for me both mentally and physically. I tried yoga, but that made me go into my mind and focus too much on problems, climbing did the opposite, it made me focus on the external and let go of the internal issues."

AskTrollX,397clo,TurquoiseOrange,2,Tue Jun 9 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"Ok. I was talking to friends about this the other day because a friend wants to have sex with her friend, but is worried about getting an unwanted amount of feelings for him. I agree with the advice she got that was ""The good thing about feelings is you can have a choice in them, you just spend less time with the person and they fade.""   It does happen, the feelings fade and if you don't worry about them too much and don't hang any other additional insecurities on your feelings about someone else or about sex (been there) they will continue to fade.  Just in case you find it useful at all the advice I gave to my friend was along the lines of this:  She broke up with somebody because he didn't want ""her"" he wanted ""it"" (sex). She wants this guy, but doesn't want a long term relationship with him. I told her that the slight feelings she has for him are the difference between wanting him and wanting ""it"". So in that sense it is a good thing. The emotional connection, the 'seeing' someone on a certain level is a big part of sex for a lot of people.   And don't worry, it isn't only like this because it was your first time. You can have that closeness again someday if you want, and with someone who is the right person for you to pursue a relationship with if you choose to.   Identifying and challenging insecurities in yourself is a good investment in having that intimacy with yourself. I'm sorry if it sounds tacky, I'm not even joking though, I genuinely mean it!"

There was a drunken one night stand and then after a few months a little mess of a relationship. The second thing only happened because my feelings were too strong for me to ignore - I've never felt like this before (the good stuff and misery) and I just can't handle it.

AskTrollX,398aic,anxietyyyyyyyyy,2,Tue Jun 9 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"It's a local event planning firm that is expanding and doing well.  the position is 3-8 hours per shift, but it does not say how many shifts per week are available - just that it is mainly evenings and weekends.  It's related to my field of study so it will be an amazing opportunity - I am excited.   So anyway I got so excited that I accepted the job without asking the average number of shifts per week.  I can't remember what she said at the interview, it was a blur cause I was nervous.  I already quit my barista job and I wonder if I messed up - I expected that most employees would receive a few  shifts per week or something like that - the average for part time work, so I hope I dont get a bad surprise when I arrive the the orientation - like ""haha only one shift every few weeks, for you!!""  I mean the owner of the company is taking staff photographs and creating bios for the website and giving us a BBQ for orientation day so it doesnt sound like she would screw everyone over like that but still I am worried and now I have no way of finding out till I get my work schedule.   But it looks like 30 ppl are invited to the bbq (judging from the names on the email list) - that seems like a lot of new employees  - I dont know if those are new employees or just ALL the employees at the firm.  I think you need multiple helpers for each event but still I am worried that I messed up and wont get enough shifts.  TLDR I am probably worrying about nothing - I bet I will get there and realize that the hours are normal for part time/casual work - like 15 hours per week or something.  BUt I am concerned that I messed up and now I will receive like only a few shifts per month and then I'm screwed."
AskTrollX,398aic,zlpatnegam,3,Tue Jun 9 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"Try not to worry so much. Let your employer know you are interested in x# of shifts/week and talk with the scheduler. Once they realize that you are reliable, motivated, and in need, they will make sure you're working a fair amount. Any smart employer is going to want to make sure they keep a good employee with them and part of that means making sure they have enough shifts to cover their expenses. Also congratulations! And remember that you can always look for more/different employment if what you've got going on isn't working. Just make sure to give notice before you go!"

AskTrollX,39409v,TurquoiseOrange,5,Tue Jun 9 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah. We met two and a half years ago at a New Years Eve concert. He was really into me, I told him I didn't usually date men, and we decided to be friends. A week later we were getting drunk and making out. Within a few more weeks we were hanging out constantly and I was falling for him. It was a huge identity conflict for me. I hadn't been interested in dudes romantically for a while, and had never really been interested in getting physical. (You're totally right, penises are weird looking.)      But as we like to say, I fell in love with a person, not a gender or genitalia. We moved very slowly on the physical parts, he was incredibly patient and understanding. It was a few months before I was comfortable trying PiV sex, and he never pushed me to do anything I didn't want. Flash forward to now, and we're engaged!     It was a long and confusing road for me, I had to basically re-come out to my friends and parents. I have a friend who talks about how I ""used to be a lesbian."" But I'm still the same person, I'm still queer. I just happen to be in love with a man now. I think it helps a little that he's bi. So like even though it may look like we're straight from the outside, we know neither of us are. It helps to share that with him.      This was really long and rambley, sorry. But there's your story!"

So you could go with, ""I feel annoyed/offended, when you mansplain, and I would like you to consider my intelligence/reflect on my experiences/ask if I know about a topic before explaining it.""

AskTrollX,394n63,bluefuzzyoctopus,18,Tue Jun 9 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't use the term ""mansplain"" because he probably doesn't even realize he's doing it. I would call up specific examples of the behavior, and be sure to say it when he's exhibiting said behavior."

If that's so, then holy fuck does my father mansplain the shit out of everything. I mean, c'mon: my bio degree is TWENTY YEARS more recent than yours, and from a major university not a Johnny-come-lately college. I know what a goddamn PCR is.

I would just start pointing out whenever he does it. Maybe start poking a bit of fun at it, but then if he keeps on doing it, address him directly and seriously. Don't make it into a lecture, just let him know whenever it's a problem in the moment."
AskTrollX,394n63,beanbaconsoup,2,Tue Jun 9 15:02:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. He has a good sense of humor. That might work if he can take a hint. He has a bit of the fragile male ego thing going.

My fiance has had his beard and been clean shaven throughout our relationship and although I miss his face sometimes I'm not going to tell him that. As long as he keeps it clean and trimmed.
AskTrollX,3954tf,CThomasFlood27,9,Tue Jun 9 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Unless there's an issue of hygiene or extreme discomfort (e.g. his beard scratches your face up when you kiss), then I feel like this is an unreasonable request. You shouldn't ask people to change their appearance just because you find ""it's a bit of a turn-off to me personally."""
AskTrollX,3954tf,holymadness,4,Tue Jun 9 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"His scratches me for a few days after he trims it up. But it is what it is, I'm glad he keeps it clean and trimmed. My ex did NOT and I hated it."
AskTrollX,3954tf,CThomasFlood27,2,Tue Jun 9 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"I never said I'd request anything of him. I only want him to know about my preference. It probably hasn't even occurred to him that I'd prefer something different, considering he had it when we met.   I wouldn't care if he said he'd like it if my hair was shorter, as long as he didn't make me feel obligated to change it. There's nothing wrong with wanting to look better for your partner, as long as it's not an obligation."
AskTrollX,3954tf,CThomasFlood27,3,Tue Jun 9 20:29:38 2015 UTC,I already said that it's fine if he doesn't want to shave it. I just want to express my preference so he's aware that I'd like it if he shaved. I don't see what's wrong with that. I would just be significantly more attracted to him if he didn't have it. How is it superficial to have physical sexual preferences?
AskTrollX,3954tf,CThomasFlood27,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"To say in passing like ""oh, if you wanted to shave, it'd be okay"" is one thing as opposed to straight up telling him you'd think he was more attractive without it. I don't remember if you mentioned how long you'd been seeing each other? I think that is also an important factor in bringing up appearances."
AskTrollX,3954tf,CThomasFlood27,2,Tue Jun 9 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Not too long. I did ask if I should wait. But we are exclusive and he's really into me. We both really want something long-term.  Wouldn't it be kind of weird to just say this...   ""oh, if you wanted to shave, it'd be okay""   ... out of nowhere? Sounds weirdly passive-aggressive."

At that point in time to me you're getting to know their personality more than anything.   Now he'll mention like ""I'm not crazy about that top,"" and I typically go ""oh you shouldn't wear it then"" because I don't care what he thinks about my clothes. But we are comfortable enough at this point to do that. I think if you mention things like that to early on it can hurt their ego and confidence in the relationship."
AskTrollX,3954tf,kanad3,2,Tue Jun 9 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my concern. I don't want to make him feel bad about it, especially since he's way more into me than I am into him at this point. He's a great guy, but being in a relationship is really weird to me as I have a pretty bad social anxiety disorder. It kinda makes me feel bad cause he's a little clingy, which I don't mind on it's own, but I feel bad for being so distant in comparison. I'm afraid he thinks it's something about him making me like that, when really it's just cause being around people I'm not already super close to is terrifying to me."

AskTrollX,390wik,weedinafoxhole,14,Mon Jun 8 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"TLDR at the bottom  My thirteen year old sister came into my room one night and told me she had something to say to me. I once told her if she ever needed anything she could always come to me. She told me she's starting to feel a lot of self-loathe. She said everyday every second she reminds herself of all her flaws and imperfections, constantly calling herself stupid and ugly.  As I myself have suffered and am still suffering from depression, she thought it was best to tell me first since she thought I would understand her the most. I told her that that was exactly how my depression started. I hugged her and we both cried. I told her it's okay and she shouldn't be afraid. I reminded her that we have a lot of help available for her, there's counseling and medication and all that. She has only two friends who are apparently both bipolar but constantly depressed when they talk to her, she doesn't talk much to strangers and even most of our relatives, she's extremely shy but she's incredibly smart and talented in writing since she reads a ton of books.  I told her I will always be here to love her and support her, and that she can always come to me if she ever needed anything at all. I told her that everyone has hope of overcoming depression, and that I'm very happy and proud of her for telling me early before it got worse. We come from a religious family, our parents are both very religious Muslims who constantly tell us to read our prayers, although they have come a long way in understanding mental illnesses. However, since finding out my sister is bisexual, they seem to remind her more than they remind the rest of my siblings. It also doesn't help that our other sister (sixteen years old) always berates her about her personal hygiene (admittedly she isn't the best in keeping herself clean but she tries).  Even though I've gone through depression, I still am unsure of how to help her. I realize that different people experience depression differently, and I want to be careful not to suffocate her but still not accidentally give her too much space. I've informed both my parents with her consent, and they both understand and want her to get counseling. My parents think she's too young to be taking medication as it may mess up her brain development, although I have no scientific basis for that.  I just want the best for her and I never want her to feel alone because I know what it's like to spend all your energy hating yourself and to have no one there for you. I've told her that she needs to be kind to herself, treat herself the way she would treat others. But I'm sort of a hypocrite since I don't even take my own advice. Do you girls have any idea what I can say or do for her that can help her?  TLDR: Thirteen year old sister is starting to feel a lot of self-loathe and may be depressed. What are some things I can do or say that can help her?"

Buy disposable cameras and go on a hike, take pictures of the wonderful thing that is the world we live in. Nothing helps the cloud of unhappiness in my mind more than just going outside and seeing again how beautiful the world is. Just, look up close at a flower, it is just so amazing that it grew to be so pretty. Encourage her to read her books outside, I do this often (actually just got back from reading by a lake) and find myself getting absorbed into the book for a while, then looking up to appreciate the world outside of the book every once in a while. The best thing I did for my mental health, was realizing there is much more outside of ""me."" When I start to feel down, I go outside, I go on a walk, I sit under a tree, I look at a plant, I look at the sky, I smile at people walking by.

AskTrollX,390wik,Meskaline,7,Fri Jun 12 04:20:30 2015 UTC,"A couple of things that helped me when going through depression were having something to distract myself with and going to the psychologist.  Going to the psychologist helped me because I had someone to talk to about everything, and who had a big understandment on how the mind works. Mine gave me some great therapies that really helped me put my life in perspective; like, where do my traumas come from, and getting to terms with a few things I can't change.  A psychologist also doesn't necesarelly prescripts pills or medicine; these kinds of therapies work with your memories and your communications. Sometimes it can be rough like when they touch on the source of traumas, but once you've takend that out and walk out of the session you feel way better.  I also took up tarot reading and videogames as hobbies; activelly doing something helped me not be depressed, at least while I was doing that."
AskTrollX,390wik,raziphel,5,Mon Jun 8 13:55:50 2015 UTC,"It's hard to stay on top of things (like hygiene) when you're depressed, but it's good that she's working on it.  Remind her that these things are even hard for adults who've practiced handling it a lot.  Journaling helps.  Having people to talk to helps.  Eating well and avoiding sugar helps.  Medications and therapy help.  There are a lot of coping mechanisms and ideas online; it would be good for her to research these things.  Just remind her that being depressed doesn't make her weak or lesser, nor is it something that defines her; it's just brain chemicals being jerks (on top of being thirteen).  Being in a stressful home doesn't help either, and some days, just crawling out of bed is a victory.    Make sure she knows you're proud of her, that you love her, and even though your parents and sister are having problems with stuff, that they love her too (they're just bad at showing it.  Many people are, especially when kids start making their own decisions).  motivatinggiraffe.com (or /r/motivatinggiraffe if she's on reddit) helps.  ""No Zero Days"" is a good motto, too.    I've heard a technique where if you feel like cutting or self-harming, that you draw on your body instead.  I haven't done that, but it's certainly worth exploring."
AskTrollX,390wik,Throwyourtoothbrush,5,Mon Jun 8 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"There are theories that cutting is a stress grooming behavior... like how a stressed animal does something like lick off all it's fur in spots.   The theory stems from the fact that very young children have been documented cutting, and people with no suicidal thoughts engage in cutting.  Adapting the behavior to other forms of ""grooming"" seems like it's worth a try... maybe makeup, body art, henna, nail art, etc."

AskTrollX,390wik,anniebme,5,Mon Jun 8 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"Encourage her to seek a counselor. Be with her if she asks your parents to allow her that access. The cool thing is, the counselor will not disclose your sister's sessions with your parents. They can assume she is being counseled on one ""cause"" of depression while what is really on her mind is being aired in a nonjudgmental space. It's adding who your sister can turn to. One more person to confide in might just help her."
AskTrollX,390wik,Awknee,2,Mon Jun 8 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"Another troll has already mentioned distraction and I'm going to second it in terms of temporary distraction. I usually find it hard to think about other people as having the same problems or being there for me when I get a wave of depression, so it's nice to sort of pull the person out of the irrational pits temporarily by doing something fun or mindless. This comic comes to mind when brainstorming about things you can do to show that you care and get your sister out of the funk temporarily so you guys can talk it out rationally for a bit.   As you know, it gets difficult to take care of yourself sometimes when depression hits. Doing things with your sister like making food and brushing your teeth together might help her (make sure to make silly faces and not to bash on their performance of such things unless totally necessary). Basic things like having food in your stomach can seem difficult to accomplish, but make the difference in your entire mood for the day. Consider making smoothies, protein shakes, or food that is easy to eat.   It's okay to be sad, but not to be sad forever. Seeking medical advice might is a good idea because something microscopic is enough to make you feel like your life is worthless. I'm not sure if this has helped at all, but I'd like to add something a bit more personal, too. If things escalate, let her know that if she ends her life, there's no possibility of fun shit like eating chocolate and making nests with her big sister! It helped me a bunch because sometimes I needed to tell myself that if I died, I'd never get to eat steak again, and I really love steak as a food. A thought as simple as that to joke with can go a long way.  As always, all the trolls are here for you and we'll always be here to talk it out. c:"

Remember teens are just learning what coping mechanisms are, they are developing how they will react when they have these feelings. Its awesome she's going to go to counseling. As far as meds- its up to her. As I teen I didn't want meds and I told my therapist that and we came up with a med-free treatment plan together. I had to do all kinds of lame stuff like not eat sugar or caffeine, but it really helped."
AskTrollX,390wik,slouise,2,Tue Jun 9 01:43:57 2015 UTC,My older sister was just always there for me to vent/cry to. I'd wake her up at crazy hours of the night/morning sobbing and she'd be totally cool to sit and listen.   We'd also have beach dates or shopping dates. Basically spend time doing something we both enjoy. Sometimes watching standup  comedians (it was helpful to laugh) or crafting something together. Just having her around was helpful.
AskTrollX,390wik,CourageousWren,2,Tue Jun 9 05:59:44 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if this is depression or ""just"" low self esteem. One might be causing the other. Food for thought.   Take her to a doctor, help her get meds. They do not impact growing minds, and research has shown early intervention is really really important. Basically... straighten out her chemicals before she has a decade to ruin her life and solidify cognitive paths of failure and self loathing.  buy a depression cognitive therapy workbook for her to train her thoughts in more productive ways. Those workbooks are great, especially since she is so young and doesnt have decades of havits to unlearn. Just as good as therapy, often. Or way more effective if you cant find the right therapist. if you cook, make sure she eats healthy, lots of veggies and water.  invite her out for walks in the sunshine. Sun and bird song is a lesser known and powerful therapy.    But mostly... just be involved and help her with life. Things snowball when you have depression and make everything worse. Make a practice of hanging out with her regularily and helping her do chores. My sister is 30 with a house, and I visited her yesterday with slurpees and we sat folding laundry together and listening to music because she wasnt feeling chatty but needed the company. In the end the laundry piles were gone, weight off her mind, shes got an accomplishment to feel good about, and she was happier and knew she was loved and her condition was no big deal that could be worked around with help.   Stuff like that."

Another thing I use to kick me out of depressive periods is oranges. There's something visceral about peeling and eating a Clementine that pulls me up, makes me realize I need to clean myself and my space, brings me back to the world and clears mental cobwebs away.   Something my sister does that makes me feel better is just her being physically near me. We'll hang out on her bed together each reading or doing our own thing. We dont even have to be talking but just her physical presence is comforting and makes me feel less alone."
AskTrollX,390wik,InkAndComb,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"If a tanning bed is available that primarily uses more UVB rays than UVA, and your sister is comfortable wearing clothing in the bed (limited exposure versus all her skin), this can be a small benefit.  Most beds are concentrated in UVA; this is the kind that bronzes, but has less vitamin D. I live in a state that rarely gets enough sunshine and it's known that over half the population gets S.A.D. Because of this I started searching for salons that had the less-tanning effective beds to try to get some sunshine.  Tanning isn't always a good substitute due to cancer risks, but when someone has severe depression, a 10-15 minute session with clothes and certain sunscreen can be very helpful.  Obviously check with your doctor if she's prone to melanoma, etc.   There are also lamps that emit UVB but in lower levels, enough to get Vitamin D but not enough to tan (these can be very mood boosting at home).  Best times to be outside are before 12pm and after 5pm to minimize health risks of the sun also. They say 3-4 times a week of 15 minutes in the sun is enough for your vitamin D levels.  I've heard mushrooms also have a lot of Vitamin D, depending on the species!"

My husband will tag me in a post if we're out doing something special a handful of times a year, but otherwise he isn't very active on social media except for some tech posts. I personally only care about what he says and does in the context of real life, and not for the benefit of acquaintances online but we tend to lean more private about the PDA stuff.

Some people tend not to take me as seriously because I look ""alternative"" (nose ring, purple hair, tattoos). Then I mention that I was a biochemistry major and I can see their faces change from ""fucking punk/stupid bitch"" to ""oh shit this girl is actually smart and capable"" and honestly that pisses me the fuck off. Being smart and being ""punk"" are NOT mutually exclusive and it pisses me off to no end that people think that they are. Not to mention that men tend to think they can say rude/sexual/trivializing things to me and I definitely have felt more objectified by men because I think I fill some sort of ""bad girl"" fantasy for them. So yes, colorful hair makes me feel fucking awesome, but I constantly feel judged and objectified.

I'm trying just crystal based deodorant without aluminum now hoping to ""reset"" my internal stink-bomb, but I, maybe extreme paranoia, think I can still smell myself. IT IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

I would recommend using a combination of a stronger nighttime antiperspirant and a regular morning AP. For nighttime, the clincal strength ones you can find at most drugstores might be enough, but you could also try something stronger like Certain-Dri which seems to be harder to find (at least where I am) and is a lot stronger. Letting the AP soak in overnight helps it be more effective, but you'll want to make sure your room is cool enough so you don't just sweat it off at night. Then in the AM, use your usual daily antiperspirant.   If that doesn't work, you could also talk to your doctor about a prescription strength antiperspirant. Or you could try an alternate option like sweater guards."

He'll (hopefully) care about you getting off with him and want to learn how to make it happen. Secondly, learning how to make it happen means he'll be more mindful of what you need and that might improve PIV.

Especially if it's birth control related, I would hope he wouldn't take that personally, since a lot of women suffer from decreased libido and sexual side affects. I have been on medication that made it impossible for me to orgasm and it was awful. On my current meds I can come, but not all the time and it definitely takes more work than it used to. My partner knows about it and we work harder to try to make sure I have a good time. It's better for both of you if he knows what's going on. If your guy is anything like mine, he will be delighted when you do come, and won't feel like he messed up when you don't.    As far as making yourself come, do you masturbate? Do you use toys? I personally could probably count on one hand the amount of times I've came without vibration. Make sure you know what your body needs to get off. For most women, orgasm from PiV sex isn't achievable without clit stimulation. It's not cheating or anything, you're still coming during sex if you're using toys with your partner!"
AskTrollX,38yrsm,saraithegeek,12,Mon Jun 8 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for.  If you want fairly cheap and fairly simple, try H&M - their basics are a staple in my wardrobe.  Some people have trouble with them falling apart after a few washes; mine have held up remarkably well.  I love the everloving crap out of Modcloth, but quality and fit can be hit-or-miss depending on the item.  That said, the community reviews are fantastic when it comes to that.  Ruche is also good - tends to be a similar aesthetic to Modcloth, and slightly cheaper to boot, but it doesn't have the community review aspect so it can be a little tricky at times.  Hope this helps!  Happy shopping :)"

My housemates are currently moving out, my boyfriend is potentially about to become a LDR, I might have to leave my job and have no idea where I'll be at the end of the month, but it's okay. I'm trying to get past it by making plans and thinking about the future and what I want to do. Not saying this is easy, I've had a few rejections all ready and it's really disheartening to experience.   What you have to remember though is that we are still young and there is plenty of time to get where we want to be, never give up on that. I've seen so many posts on here and TrollX about people that have finally found a job in the field that they wish, sometimes months or even a year after they started looking.

AskTrollX,38vk85,ionadhtalamh,6,Sun Jun 7 04:53:10 2015 UTC,"I made a post about this situation on here a few weeks ago. The TL;DR version is a longtime and my only friend (0) was making me very frustrated and exhausted with her negativity, I started to avoid her to get her out of my life, and I rekindled a friendship with a long-missed friend (2).  Last night, Friend 0 texted me asking if I was free today. I told her I had to babysit, and wouldn't be able to (not even sure why I texted her, since I've been mostly avoiding her). Today came, and I babysat in the morning. Friend 2 was coming over regardless, to hang out while I babysat. I ended up not having to watch the girl during the afternoon hours, but had to babysit her in the early evening hours. So 2 and I decided to run to a few stores for a handful of hours. We decided to go to the mall, for a quick trip. While we were walking in, I noticed there was a car a lot like 0's, but didn't think much of it. But then 10 seconds later, I look ahead and see 0 walking towards us with two other girls. Wonderful.  0 and 2 used to be the best of friends, but 0 kept being a jerk and 2 left, leaving 0 and I behind (though 2 was never mad at me). In turn, 0 hates 2 a lot over nothing, thus I never told her that I had become friends with 2 again. She didn't/doesn't really to know anyway. 0 is VERY easy to agitate and quickly flies off the handle, so 2 power walked inside while I approached 0, avoiding her. The two girls with 0 walked to the car. I could tell that 0 was mad, but I was prepared for what ever.  By her body language, 0 was mad, but the first words were ""What?... I'm not mad at you."" Then went into a rant about how I can tell her everything, it wasn't right that I didn't tell her, asked if she did anything wrong, that I can be honest with her, that she was worried about me, then made a huge note that she was mad at me for not telling her. I told her I had a lot going on at home (which I absolutely do; family health issues, taking care of my grandparents, all of that), and admitted that I've been depressed. Also very true. Then 0 went on about 2, saying that she'll never forgive her and doesn't understand why I would.  Then 0 started making it about herself, saying I should have told her, she can't believe that I didn't tell her. I tried to re-butte that she (0) would fly off the handle, and it didn't feel right to text her that I was friends with 2 again; I wanted to tell her in person. I honestly do hate springing crap like that up in a text, plus I absolutely do not think that 0 had to know. 0 has her work friends (see the two girls she was with earlier), I had only 0 for the longest time. Until I made up with 2, I had no other friends at ALL. I was always with 0 and only her.  But then, 0 made an odd jump. I just got a ton of hair cut off, and she started complimenting me on it suddenly. Then she started talking about movies, like it was a normal conversation. (???) I asked her where her boyfriend is (who is normally attached to her hip), but he was at work. The conversation right after that suddenly flipped again. She got kind of aggressive, and made me pinky swear hard that I would see her next Saturday, or else. I pinky sweared, but told her I had to work until the early evening hours and it would have to be at night. 0 said I had better, otherwise she ""knows that something more is going on here."" 0 said she had to go, said that I'd better see her next week, that she doesn't appreciate being lied to (because the girl I was babysitting earlier wasn't with me), said goodbye, and walked away.  The more I think about it, the more I am very very angry. That last bit with the pinky swear? She is being so, SO incredibly manipulative. Also about me lying about babysitting? If she would have shut the hell up for 10 seconds, I could've told her the truth. But at this point, regardless of what I say, will she even believe me? Is it even worth it? No. It's not.  So, in turn, how do I react Trolls? I haven't heard from her and vice versa, via text. I was almost expecting a shitty, vague post on Facebook about it, but nothing. I know the moment she got in the car, she just blew a gasket. Why do I still care, though? I need to learn not too. 0 is such a negative energy in my life, I cannot have her in it anymore. Talking reasonably is out of the question; the only reason it went so well is because it happened so fast and out of the blue. Thankfully, 2 and I had a good shopping trip afterward. 2 almost had a panic attack, but recovered quickly. Later on, I got to take the girl I babysat to see a movie, and got to not worry about things for a while. :3 (And I cannot believe how long I made this... whoops. >_> It's late, I'm tired, meh.)  TL;DR - Ran into someone I've been avoiding, with someone they hate and didn't know I was friends with again. What do I do?"
AskTrollX,38vk85,Muzyna,12,Sun Jun 7 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"I remember your story. Did you talk about the situation with 2? She could have insight on this.  You don't want 0 in your life anymore, and I can't blame you, she sounds like a piece of work. Either you continue ignoring her and hope she won't make you pinky-swear to see her (...), or you cut ties once and for all.   It is only my opinion as an internet stranger, but I think you go with the latter. Send her a message or call her saying something along 'This friendship isn't doing it for me, I'm unhappy with the dynamics and I'd rather stop spending time with you' (I'm pretty sure you can find 'friendship break-ups' posts in /r/relationships with good ideas for what to say without worsening it, I'm not eloquent), because stretching this seems to put a strain on you and I don't think she's worth it. You can't keep investing energy in this mess of a relationship. (If you take that course of action, give a bit of time to how you formulate things, no name-calling but ""I"" sentences etc).  I don't think you'll avoid a bit of drama if you don't want to keep seeing her anyway, because 0 looks like she wants to keep you close, so I'd rather be honest and firm with her, but if you keep waiting and resenting her you could explode on her along in some time and say regrettable things. Do it while you still can keep your calm and getting out without impairing your mental health. Time to cut to the chase.  But I don't know you or her, so that's just my opinion, I don't know if it's your better option. Hope you get rid of her without drama. Good luck :)"

But 2 really is a good friend; she was understanding, and felt bad that she kind of peaced out.  I always forget about that subreddit; I will definitely check it out when I get home. But you're so right; I'm making it worse by not being up front and honest. If I keep dragging this out, it's only going to get worse. I have to be the one to cut the line. 0 will just keep playing the victim over and over. I just need to find the strength to do it, thank you. :)"
AskTrollX,38vk85,river_trail,6,Sun Jun 7 20:17:48 2015 UTC,My friends advised this when I was in a similar pickle: You'll be surprised at how strong you've gotten when you put down the dead weight you've carried.  0 needs to be a friend to you too and it sounds like you're just someone who can listen to her drama. She needs to get her shit together and that is not your responsibility. You deserve to be happy.

I finally got my hair cut after nearly five years (a foot and a half of hair GONE D:), I'm more energetic, I'm starting to care more about taking care of my self. Even though 0 is still sort of part of my life, the effects are already happening. :3 Maybe I'm even becoming more... not sure the word for it, but I'm caring about myself more.  Maybe for the first few months, she was a good friend. But sometime around mid last year, the friendship slowly started feeling like a chore. I would come home, feeling tired and awful, not really understanding why. 0's not the start of my unhappiness, but she has made it worse. The right path is there, I simply need to find it.

AskTrollX,38u4vm,InkAndComb,30,Sat Jun 6 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"This is one of those situations where I feel like sassy comments/comebacks aren't really going to do anything to solve the problem. If this friend is a good person, being honest with them about how their behavior is affecting you and your friendship will make them rethink how they communicate with you. If this friend isn't a good person, they'll try to make you feel bad for being honest, and then at least you'll know not to be friends with them.  Sometimes people are afraid of being honest in these situations, because they're afraid telling their friend that they're upsetting them will offend them. But guess what - this friend is offending you, and you have every right to let them know it."
AskTrollX,38u4vm,donaisabelle,11,Sat Jun 6 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"So, every time I try to talk to this friend (as of late), they will interrupt and ask enough questions or roll their eyes or respond sarcastically in a way that makes me flustered and struggle to figure out how to not be offended/keep talking.  Example:  Me: So I was hanging out with Emily and she said-  Him: Wait, where were you hanging out? (irritated tone)  Me: Um, xyz. Anyways-  Him: Well that's important to the story. I can't know anything  without context, InkAndComb (exasperated)  Me: Ok, well continuing. We did (activity), and I thought (opinion), but she-  Him: Wait, why is this important? What is this relevant to?  Me: What? (now flustered) I'm just talking about what I did yesterday, I thought it was interesting-  Him: Oh. Ok, I guess. (bored tone/expression)   Me: ....nevermind (too irritated to continue)  I'm tired of not being able to sass back or think of something to say in response!

At this point he doesn't deserve witty banter he deserves a ""fuck you dude, I'm not letting anyone talk to me like this"".   He's being really disrespectful. I wouldn't even bother.   But if you do want to say something I like ""oh I'm sorry the middle of my sentence interrupted the start of yours. Please continue"".   If I'm really pissed off and not feeling tactful I just look straight at them and say ""that was rude"" - which can be hilarious if they're not used to being called out so bluntly."

No, please, continue, I was just getting interested. What were you saying? Oh, you were just asking me a question?

AskTrollX,38tarp,Boo_X,13,Sat Jun 6 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"the power and control wheel is helpful to identify abuse and what type.   For coping there should be a women's resource organization in your area that can help you identify the abuse and they may provide counseling there or give you recommendations if you're comfortable. A quick google search should bring up a few near you.   if you have close friends that you're comfortable talking to it can be very helpful. Just to have their support. It helped me a lot.   A big thing is to recognize its not your fault, it's not just in your head and it was not okay and not normal behavior. But you will be okay."
AskTrollX,38tarp,kaunis,7,Sat Jun 6 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"If you think he was, he probably was. It's not something you can got over at once, it's been over a year since my ex and I split and I still have little flash backs about him screaming at me and gaslighting me. It's a process, I'm married now so that helps me. But it takes months to get over and comprehend, when I started dating my husband I kept thinking he would yell at me for the things my ex did but he never did. It helped me a lot. But like i said it takes time, a lot of time, just keep thinking about yourself and if the person is being nice or an ass hole, don't let them sugar coat stuff.

You do not need to be a direct DV victim to attend. They go over all the signs and symptoms and you hear about the experience from others, so you don't feel alone, plus ways to cope.  Also therapy works wonders too. It can be a short term therapy stint, 6 mos to a year with sessions one or twice a month, no need to go forever. A therapist trained in recognizing abuse can give you a much needed rational third party perspective and validate your experience. Most work on a sliding scale."

AskTrollX,38rrzl,bloomingpurplerose,3,Sat Jun 6 09:24:38 2015 UTC,"I used to worry about that kind of thing, too, trying to speed things up and meet a new person to date when I was single. I met my current SO at a professional meet-and-greet thing. Before that I had met guys online, a few times I met guys in this park I really like-- sometimes they have events, sometimes you get stuck in a picnic pavillion during a rain shower-- and of course I met guys through friends and stuff. I always found it harder to stay single long term than to date casually, and my policy was I'd have coffee with anybody. But none of those people I met in the ""place you meet people"" turned out to be good matches for me. We just didn't have anything in common, or we didn't have anything to talk about, or we were both there to meet a dating partner -- usually this was the problem with online guys -- and so we were just testing to check basic compatibility before diving in to a weird three-week relationship. I think, now, from the luxury and privilege of a great relationship, that I was in too much of a hurry. It takes time to know what a person is really like, to identify those deep-down similarities that really make people compatible. If you just do things you like, or if you at least do something consistently and frequently like a job or networking for a job or running an online gaming campaign or whatever, you will eventually meet people you get along great with. You'll eventually meet people you're attracted to, who are attracted to you. Really, really you will. It might take a couple years, and there's nothing wrong with doing some casual relationships with online folks or folks you meet at bars in the meantime. But if you're single for a couple of years, so what? Everybody goes through it. Everybody. It sucks, but it's universal -- and sex toys are thing."

I only decided to try it because I wanted to find someone I really had stuff in common with and was compatible with. I love meeting new people etc. but I get so frustrated spending too much time talking to people with a really different perspective, and a relationship with someone who really doesn't respect, understand, or value your views is really odd and I was a bit fed up of that sort of thing. Decided that online dating might use maths to match me up! Mind you, it matched me with my a-sexual friend at like 98% and my actual partner was initially matched at only 70% odd percent.   I enjoyed having an adorable story of how I met my previous partner, but I actually way more enjoy finding someone who wants similar things out of the relationship, communicates in a way that is compatible with me, and we have both been able to be clear that yes we wanted to initiate a romance. It's been really good. We have a couple of major differences in hobbies and beliefs, but all the core stuff we either are compatible or we are both so relaxed and accepting that it is more interesting than problematic, I think a few differences can mean the differences between a partner who agrees with you and a partner who challenges but supports you."

I end up with an attitude whenever she asks me to help her “clean” aka move things around and not get rid of anything. Which has turned into me just being a dick most of the time if she speaks to me. I have a lot of pent up resentment for some of the things she has said and done to me over the years. But I need to somehow let it go to be able to live under the same roof. I’m not like this with anyone else in my life.   When I was younger if I was myself she often over reacted with threatening to kick me out if I dyed my hair or if I was interested in tarot cards. Which then turned into oh the car you drive is in my name I say when you are home. Twice did it turn into empty death threats against my friends or pets. I see it as being really manipulative/emotionally abusive. I was 18-23 at the time. I’m 26 now. I’m taking over dad’s business but part of the agreement is taking care of them. While she hasn’t pulled anything in awhile, I’m not sure how to let go. She’s always wanted to be best friends with me, but not let me be me it was like I’d have to be a mini her. If her blood sugar goes off she tends to fly off the handle. I get that it’s part of her illness. When I asked why she threatened to kill my friends and pets several years ago in hopes to patch things over. Her response was laughter and then “I had to”.   I’ve taken steps to have boundaries. My room is my room; she doesn’t get to dictate what it looks like anymore. (Originally all pink with antique dolls). My door has a lock on it now. I finally got stable enough to get my own car in my name. When I’m getting rid of things of mine she is not allowed to rummage through them to hoard things. Which all these things have helped with less conflict. I just still have the attitude that came with all the conflicts.    Got any tips that can help me let it go? Moving isn't an option, as most of my income is tied up back into the business."
AskTrollX,38r2uj,lokimorgan,10,Sat Jun 6 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"When I find myself in situations I can't get out of with people who irritate me I try to think, it must be hard..  It must be hard for your mom to not have control over her mental illness well enough to help herself.  It must be hard for her to feel so much anxiety when trying to get rid of things.  It must be hard for her to know that her behavior is impacting the people she loves.  When I can see how things are hard for them it helps me have compassion.  This helps me be more conscious of my emotions when dealing with them.  I'm sorry you're in this situation, it seems really rough! :("
AskTrollX,38r2uj,ThisIsADogHello,8,Sat Jun 6 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"Sure it's be hard to be someone like that who feels so bad, but they lose all sympathy from me when their solution to feeling bad is to try and make everyone else forced to deal with them feel just as bad to cheer themselves up.  My solution for dealing with toxic family is mostly to recognise that their actions are not those of someone who has any positive regard for me, is not a well-adjusted person by any means, and generally has the emotional maturity of a child.  I do my best by keeping them by getting to me by generally avoiding them when I can, and being as boring as I can be to them.  When they come around looking to start some kind of argument, I generally keep my answers to ""i dunno"" and ""ok"", or as close to that as I can manage.  They love to argue and will do so for as long as they can, and standing up for myself is just an invitation for them to continue berating me.  When my mom starts going on about how I'm worthless and have no friends and am only alive because of her, I usually just fantasizing about one day being able to pick out her nursing home, and wondering how hard it'd be to find the worst possible one, all while nodding and going ""ok"" ""alright"" ""mmhmm"".  It sounds horrible for me to think of someone in this way, but she really is a genuinely horrible person, and the fact that I share a little more genetic material with her than I do with other people is absolutely no excuse to justify her abuse.  Best you can really do is remember that you being stuck dealing with these people is only temporary, and once you're back on your feet and ready to move out again, you'll have the option of never giving them your new address or phone number."
AskTrollX,38r2uj,lokimorgan,3,Sat Jun 6 08:26:37 2015 UTC,Feeling compassion for other people isn't about them at all. It helps me because negative emotions are toxic to me.

My dad and I got good now by us leaving for a few days. When he realized how much he needs us here to help, he got over himself. My wife is finally good with her mother by leaving.

If she is being mean or rude, almost childish, speak to her like an adult would an actual child.  Obviously, you can't send her to her room, but just slowly and clearly explaining yourself.  It tends to make people recognize how ridiculous they are being.  If she hasn't done anything, but you're just generally grumpy because you have to be around her on a particular day, I suggest just keeping conversation cordial.  Just nod or say ""mhm"" and ""ok"" to small talk, and keep any further conversation relatively shortwinded on your end.  You cannot change your mom, unfortunately, but you can minimize the negativity you experience from being around her by minimizing the conversations themselves.  Hope this was helpful in any way."

The reason I do it this way is because if the expectation is that she'll act like one of your friends or something, then you'll continually be disappointed but if you expect her to act like herself, you might be surprised on occasion."

AskTrollX,38p4be,Sheerardio,4,Fri Jun 5 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"I have a laundry list of over two dozen environmental allergies and another dozen food related ones.  Here's some things my allergist told me to do when I have a bad attack:   double up on antihistamines.  Take 2 claritin in the morning, AND 2 zyrtec at night. eyedrops with KETOTIFEN as the active ingredient.  The brands I know of that have it are Alaway, Zaditor, and Visine-A Claritin D 12 hour for more immediate relief.  Works similar to Sudafed, is less likely to leave you drowsy and incoherent. Flonase, if you can successfully inhale the stuff.  Doesn't work for me personally, so I have to get a more expensive prescription nasal inhaler, but I understand it does wonders for most people.   I also find that steam showers are bliss, and that if you use a netti pot it goes much easier if you do it after spending 20 minutes breathing steam.  Breathe-Rite strips help me sleep easier.  A friend of mine swears by wearing a medical mask when going running to reduce the amount of pollen breathed in, so that might be worth considering.  Regardless of how the next couple of days go, you definitely need to find yourself an allergy specialist and get tested, so you'll know exactly what you need to avoid and can get some prescriptions to more effectively manage your symptoms."

Look into eye drops for your eyes if you're having itchy or redness issues. Most pharmacies have their own brand of drops that are affordable.   If your eyes are really watery or you know you'll be using drops use waterproof mascara. My eyes spontaneously water profusely and I end up looking like I got punched in the face if I wear normal mascara!   If your eyes are super puffy try a cooling cream or just ice cubes.

I wear tank tops under shirts so no one has to have the inconvenience of seeing my ab-less stomach.""  Someone with confidence who was raised to cherish herself for the qualities she holds inside might say ""I wear this tank top that shows my midriff because it's 90 degrees outside, I don't want to be hot, and I am not going to surround myself with people that judge me for daring to inconvenience them with the sight of my body.  I am worth more than my body and because of that I am not ashamed to wear whatever outfit I feel comfortable in.""  Which mantra would he rather have going through his daughters head?

Which of the above would be more likely to sleep with her boyfriend simply because she thinks he won't love her if she doesn't?

Are there women who dress in a skimpy fashion because the sexual attention they get from it makes them feel validated? Of course. Are there women who dress skimpily because it ales them feel beautiful and confident? Of course.   It just depends on the woman. All women do not do all things because of one particular reason."

They are thick and dark and that course hair goes almost halfway down my thighs and up into a very prominent happy trail. I am so goddamn hairy and I doubt my razor can handle it. I don't swim and I don't have a boyfriend, but I still would like to shave for myself because honestly I want to know what it feels like to masturbate. What razors or products do I need to buy? Any tips?"
AskTrollX,38k8uz,IMightBePaulasBitch,15,Thu Jun 4 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend an electric trimmer or kids safety scissors to hack away the bush. Actually, a electric trimmer might clog, so first trim down with some scissors (make sure to not cut your labia).  Scratch all this, if you don't know what to do, maybe call a waxing salon and see what they can do? It might be best for a professional to work on it so you don't hurt your labia.  Whatever you do, don't shave the long hair without trimming it first!  Good luck!  I like /r/ladyshavers because I am way less likely to get razor burn or ingrown hairs with a good shaving routine. I only shave my legs and pits though, sometimes bikini line..."
AskTrollX,38k8uz,coralto,15,Thu Jun 4 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone has got the basics down, scissors then razor, but I also want to add some stuff!   Ingrown hairs can be a problem, so there are some things you should do as well.   Use shaving cream Make sure you use a sharp razor (if you're using disposables it might take more than one the first time!) Rinse the blade in between swipes so it doesn't get all clogged,  Exfoliate afterwards and put on some lotion.    Also, if you hop in the shower for a bit after the scissors and before the razor, the hot water will soften the hairs so they cut easier and don't tug. Good luck!"
AskTrollX,38k8uz,CHClClCl,9,Thu Jun 4 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd go with something like this (note I haven't actually used it I just tried to find something to show what I was talking about) and stand in your bathroom with an empty floor.  Then kind of trim up as short as you can get it.  Feel free to put a mirror on the ground to help seeing!  Once you've got all the pubes to a managable length you can sweep up the floor and get in the shower.  From there a lot of people use different things: shaving cream, standard soap, conditioner, cocoa butter (this one's best done when you're not actually in the shower, I think), etc - and your preferred razor which I assume you have already for legs and arm pits and whatnot.  So you'll have to find what works for you.  Alternatively, and for what it's worth, I'd say the easiest way to do this part is outside the shower, standing/squatting over a small mirror with cocoa butter.  It'd probably take a lot longer but when you aren't used to shaving down there it's a pretty big bonus to be able to see absolutely everything.  Shave a small part then use a wet wash cloth to wipe everything away.  Then repeat.  Edit:  Make sure to shave your legs at the same time, and then go roll around in your bed in some clean sheets. <3"

I hate shaving completely bare because it gets itchy and it's awful. But this razor has the trimmer and an actual razor so it's a two in one! I use conditioner to shave with the razor when I'm shaping up the sides. If there is a lot of hair definitely use the comb to adjust how close the trimmer gets. And don't be afraid to use a mirror to see where you're going so you don't cut yourself.

I'm on mobile) but here are the basic steps:   Exfoliate. I use a loofah + my normal body wash Baby oil everything Lather up with shaving cream (she suggests men's I think) Take a razor (I use new, disposable ones with 3 blades) and shave first with the grain of the hair, then perpendicular, then against it. Its gonna be different for each area of your crotch but do the best you can When you get out of the shower, dab on some rubbing alcohol or witch hazel Apply a liberal amount if clear, odorless, stick deodorant. Regular dove works great. Show off your magically smooth crotch to everyone!"
AskTrollX,38k8uz,Miss_Femme_Fatale,2,Fri Jun 5 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"For me, whenever I started shaving, I found that trimming the hair before you go in with the razor touching the skin tends to go on better. Make sure you use an actual useful razor. Break out those 4x or 5x blades. Not those disposable razors. Try trimming before you go down with a razor. Clean up before you shave too. Once you trim it short enough, then go lightly on the area."
AskTrollX,38k8uz,WestCoastBestCoast01,2,Fri Jun 5 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"Deeefinitely trim beforehand if it's bad! I just use a pair of small sewing scissors whenever I need a trim. Also... buy a man's razor. Those things are made to handle rough, thick hair and are usually cheaper without the pink tax. I really like the Schick Hydro.  Other than that, just make sure to exfoliate afterwards and be prepared for some mad itchiness in a few days..."

The only thing that's helped me in the long term has been by checking off things on my ""Things I Really Want To Do But Have Been Too Chicken To Pursue"" list.   It ended up kind of snowballing. I started going to the gym because I wasn't sleeping well and was constantly insecure about my appearance, which led to major improvements in my diet, which led me to cut out a LOT of alcohol, which helped me lose the weight I've been wanting to for ages, which gave me the nerve to sign up for the dance class I always wanted to try, which inspired me to finally plan a weekend with my bestie to a city we've never been to.   The confidence I'm building from all of this is translating to other areas. My performance at work has improved, my time management is way better now, I'm not blowing all my money on useless shit. And my insecurities relating to my relationship are nowhere near where they were, because I'm starting to realize my worth, and I'm starting to realize how much I miss out on when I spend my mental energy worrying about things I can't control.  And my husband is super into seeing me chase down things that interest and excite me, and it's been wonderful for our relationship.  TL;DR: Investing in yourself and your interests is the best way stamp out your insecurities, which will improve all aspects of your life -- including relationships.

Then undress at home on your home imagining a scenario that you find sexy, like imagining that sexy boyfriend is with you and is really turned on.   A bit of 'fake it till you make it' can be useful, meaning that you ignore any little niggly ""oh no do I look silly"" voices and say to yourself ""HELL YEAH I AM DAMN HAWT.""  Being confident can be really hard, but it feels so good and it can make your interactions with other people go so well.   If you have any specific body hang ups trying looking galleries of 'normal' whatever body part and feel represented.   Try to focus on the positives. Look in the mirror and find things that are unique to you that you think are cute (I would say avoid things that are comparing yourself to some 'standar' beauty).   And don't forget that the lingerie is only there as a tease before being taken off!

AskTrollX,38aqy3,nsfwhun,24,Wed Jun 3 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"When I took a meditation course, the teacher told a lot of buddhist stories. Here's a retelling of one that stuck with me:   One day Buddha was walking through a village. A very angry and rude young man came up and began insulting him. ""You have no right teaching others,"" he shouted. ""You are as stupid as everyone else. You are nothing but a fake.""  Buddha was not upset by these insults. Instead he asked the young man ""Tell me, if you buy a gift for someone, and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?""  The man was surprised to be asked such a strange question and answered, ""It would belong to me, because I bought the gift.""  The Buddha smiled and said, ""That is correct. And it is exactly the same with your anger. If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, then the anger falls back on you. You are then the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.  ""If you want to stop hurting yourself, you must get rid of your anger and become loving instead. When you hate others, you yourself become unhappy. But when you love others, everyone is happy.""   When someone talks about me, I just try to remember that if they want to be upset, they can be upset and that's unfortunate. I don't have to be upset. If I'm happy and haven't hurt anyone else, then I have no reason to let others' negative comments get to me. It's easier said than done to maintain this attitude, though."

AskTrollX,38aqy3,Lemurlemurlemur,5,Thu Jun 4 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"I ain't no Pollyanna, but I believe that most people are inherently decent, minding-their-own-business types. That means that a lot of hurtful talk is unintentional or misdirected. Often I'll read into something innocuous because I'm feeling insecure about something, or someone will lash out because they're dealing with their own shit.    I'm practicing being more mindful of my own experiences, of openly admitting to myself that I'm feeling shitty today because of _____ rather than pretend that I'm fine, because all that does is built up stress until I lash out. Being stressed and anxious can aggravate my sense of negativity around me, that people and situations are against me.   I think as women, we're often taught to be the ""good girl"" and to not cause trouble, which invalidates our experiences and our need to express and process them. I remind myself that I'm not a bad person for feeling bad, and whenever I catch myself thinking badly about someone else, to admit that I'm doing it because their situation is triggering an insecurity or anxiety that I have, that I need to look at myself before I put down anyone.   Working on my own things has really helped me choose to be around good, supportive people and to be less concerned with things I can't change. I'm in control of my own actions and responses, so I try to focus on what I can do rather than worry about the motivations of other people."

AskTrollX,389ran,chemicalthings,3,Tue Jun 2 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"So I've recently started dating this guy and he's really great. The problem is, I'm just not as into him as I want to be or feel I should be. There's nothing wrong with him. I find him attractive, he's really into me, and we have a lot in common. But for some reason, I'm just not that into it when I'm around him. I'm really new to dating. I always thought kissing and making out would be great, but now I just can't get myself to enjoy it. I'm just doing it for him. I'm a virgin and I've never had much of a sex drive. I've considered the possibility that I'm asexual, but I don't think that's accurate as I still find some people sexually attractive and I want to enjoy physical intimacy (although I'm not near ready for sex yet). I've explained this to the guy I'm with and he's very understanding, but I'm concerned because I want to be able to enjoy kissing him (and possibly doing more later down the road). I'm starting to wonder if maybe this has to do with the medications I'm taking. I take birth control (for period reasons, obviously), Zoloft, and occasionally Xanax. I know that all three of these drugs can result in a loss of sex drive. Could this also decrease enjoyment of less sexual activities such as kissing? Also, if this is my problem, what could I do to try and fix it? I can't live without the birth control, and my anxiety is horrible as is so going off those medications could be disastrous for me. This is making me feel really conflicted about my relationship (?) with this guy. He wants to be official, and I was just like ""Sure, I guess"" because I want to be in a committed, long-term relationship, but my body just isn't responding the way I feel it should.  TL;DR Not enjoying making out; very little interest in the possibility of sex. I think it might be because of my medications. Afraid it's messing up my budding relationship."
AskTrollX,389ran,birthday-party,9,Tue Jun 2 20:40:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, but I am on anti-anxiety meds. That can absolutely kill your sex drive, and any desire you have. Anecdotally, I was on birth control far before my SSRI and didn't have any issues from that, but I know that some people do.   Being up front with him is the only thing you can do. For me, my doctor prescribed a supplementary antidepressant known to up sex drive to counteract the side effects since the benefit outweighed any potential downsides."
AskTrollX,389ran,sassyburger,3,Tue Jun 2 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. I'd rather it be the anxiety meds than the birth control because it's possible to combat the anxiety without them; can't control my period short of getting a surgery no doctor would agree to perform on me at my age. I should probably talk to my doctor about this next time I go.  Luckily, this guy is much more accepting of this than the average person would be, but I still want to enjoy being around him more. I want to have at least a semi-normal relationship. I could live without sex, but I need to enjoy at least some level of physical intimacy. I don't want to think ""sigh this again?"" every time we make out."
AskTrollX,389ran,saraithegeek,7,Tue Jun 2 21:08:12 2015 UTC,I'm on Zoloft and can confirm this is a definite side effect. I generally don't even have an appetite for food let alone sexy things with Zoloft. I would talk to your doctor and maybe think about switching medications if it's really affecting you or your relationship. There are a lot of options even though switching medications is a long and not fun process.

AskTrollX,389ran,duckgalrox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"Have you tried other forms of birth control?  Or if you're on the pill, have you tried other pills?  One pill might give you a certain side effect, but another one might not.  And it should still control your period in the same way.  (I thought I'd throw that out there just in case you only ever tried one pill - that's how it worked for me.  I was prescribed a pill, was mostly happy with it, and just stayed on it.)  I consider myself to be on the asexual spectrum, by the way, and it's different for everyone.  I can identify with a lot of what you said (and it was more true for me before I lost my virginity).  I'm actually in a sexual relationship nowadays and very happy with it.    I feel like being asexual is fairly uncommon, though, so I'd assume it's actually an issue with one of your medications.  Whatever's going on, I'd just make sure I kept checking in with the guy.  Maybe you shouldn't be in an ""official"" relationship yet.  Explain how you feel - ""I really like you, but I'm worried about my current inability to be physically intimate.  Can we wait until I get it straightened out?""  That's what I'd do."
AskTrollX,389ran,duckgalrox,2,Wed Jun 10 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on the flip side of the other commenters so far, I've never been on anti-anxiety medication but I had something similar on birth control.

AskTrollX,389ran,saraithegeek,2,Wed Jun 3 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard that loss of libido is a normal side effect for antidepressants. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant that tends to increase sex drive, so it is sometimes prescribed in addition to other antidepressants to counteract the negative side effects. Wellbutrin does have a reputation for increasing anxiety for some people though...  Medications can be so frustrating! I recently had to quit an otherwise effective mood stabilizer/anti-depressant because it prevents birth control from being effective and was giving me rashes. I have depression and anxiety, and I'm considering asking my doctor for Wellbutrin plus an anti-anxiety medication such as Buspar. Good luck, I hope you are able to find a combo of meds that works for you."
AskTrollX,389ran,saraithegeek,2,Thu Jun 4 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Are your medications overseen by a doctor?  If they  are, talk to you doctor! S/he's the one who's going to know the most about the side effects of drugs you're taking and needs to hear about any adverse effects on your moods, including your sexual one.  And remember, being asexual doesn't mean that you are always anti-sexual; some asexuals experience occasional sexual attraction and masturbate.  Being asexual also doesn't mean that you are doomed to go without romantic love or that a romantic relationship with a sexual person is impossible.    This is a link to the Asexuality Visibility & Education Network.  Do some reading, and discuss the possibility that you're asexual with your partner.  If you two can't come to some sort of agreement about the way your sexual relationship would work, where you're asexual and he's not, then you two aren't compatible.  Best of luck, and I'd look for an ace sub if you can find it."

Typically you can't sublet housing without the owners permission.  So if you have to throw them out and everything is in your name, you can just claim they were guests.  Don't sign anything with them because contracts are legally binding.   Without a signed agreement, they can't prove anything.  Protect yourself at all costs.  Set boundaries and responsibilities and don't back down for any reason - don't give them an inch.   People will gradually get into bad habits and start leaving things in public areas.  First it's shoes, then food, then garbage.  Eventually your public areas look like a pigsty.   True, you'll end up cleaning things, but once the habit is formed it's there for life.   Keep things clean from the get go, make them clean up their stuff - don't do it for them.  Your food is yours, their food is theirs.  End of story.  Don't let them start borrowing food or eating your left overs.    Smoking/drugs - toss them if they do any of these things.  Especially drugs as if those are found in the residence you can be charged too.  Smoke permeates everything and you will end up smelling as bad as they do.  It will also wreck your electronics.  Lack of cleanliness draws roaches.  If they start eating in their room and leaving food out, you're going to have roaches.   Try to encourage them to keep the food in the dining or kitchen area.  If you get roaches the best solution is Boric Acid.  You can buy it from harware stores for a couple bucks.  It's a powder.  You sprinkle it along walls, under appliances and inside electrical outlets.  It's non-toxic to humans, but it kills roaches and their eggs and keeps working for a very long time.     Set boundaries on sound.  Loud music can be a pain and can draw the ire of your neighbors.  Look out for their SOs.  A very nice person might have a pscyho SO.  Find out if they are dating and/or sexually active.   Relationships always complicate things and you may have to occasionally give them privacy (aka leave the place) if they are getting intimate.    Don't let them take advantage of you, but don't be a jerk either.   Try to find someone you know or someone who is known by someone you trust.  Try to find out about their living habits and if they have any quirks.   Watch out for hoarders.   Watch out for pet owners.   Watch out for anyone on parole or who has done time."

And create a place in your home where you can post all of the bills out in the open so everyone knows when they are due, and how much their share is. Maybe even create a place for her to leave her money so you don't have to go asking for it every month.   I wish you luck, but I also urge caution when moving in with friends.

Wait and see what happens. This could be awesome. It could be bad but lead to awesome things. But one step at a time."

AskTrollX,385ea5,kochipoik,2,Tue Jun 2 16:44:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :) its such a scary step but I guess it happens to most people eventually!
AskTrollX,385ea5,kochipoik,3,Tue Jun 2 03:09:02 2015 UTC,"It's normal to have a meltdown when it comes to commitment. Take it one step at a time. As for your bisexuality - I am too, but have never experienced anything with a woman. You do not need to validate your bisexuality to anyone. You decide who you are attracted to. I know I'm bisexual, and that's enough for me. It should be enough for anyone who wants you to explain - you don't see anyone going around and demanding people explain their heterosexuality, right?"
AskTrollX,385ea5,stinkyandlulu,2,Tue Jun 2 08:11:31 2015 UTC,"You sound really similar to me! In terms of - I still sometimes freak out about the fact that I'm in a serious relationship (8 years in, married 2 years, just bought a house together). I'm really happy but sometimes I get a bit dissociative at night time and get a bit confused/freak out.  I'm also pretty sure I'm bisexual but haven't ever had a real relationship with a woman - just stupid teenage stuff, always with the wrong people (ie making out with friends and people I thought I should like, rather than people I was actually attracted to - except for one memorable experience, making out with one girl in the middle of a mosh pit). I kind of regret that, but I met my husband when I was quite young (18). BUT, I figure: my sexuality doesn't define me. It's a bit disappointing that I don't know that side of me, but at the same time it wouldn't change my relationship with my husband, who is my Forever Person/Soulmate. I haven't told my husband although I suspect he might guess that I ""was"" bisexual. I would never want to have a relationship with anyone else so I don't think it would help, but it would upset him. Sometimes it's better to keep a secret, especially if the only reason to tell it is to make yourself feel better."
AskTrollX,385ea5,kochipoik,2,Tue Jun 2 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point about not telling him, like even if I did what could he possibly do by knowing? Thanks for the advice :)"
AskTrollX,385ea5,Rahmenframe,2,Tue Jun 2 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's how I feel. I know my husband wouldn't take it well, either. To me it would be the same if my husband admitted he wanted to ""experiment"" with other women, I'd be devastated.  It is a complex issue though, and one I've struggled with - mainly because I haven't ever talked to anyone about it (except the guy who ran the local AIDS foundation, for some reason, when we went for a day during med school)"
AskTrollX,385ea5,river_trail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:35:05 2015 UTC,"I think I disagree with not telling him, but that's my own struggle. I don't like to keep secrets just to keep the other person calm. I think it's more powerful for my SO to know that sometimes I have sexy thoughts about other people, but at the end of the day, I WANT to bring those feelings home to him and him only. He knows my truth, and has confidence that I'll act in ways that won't hurt him, but I won't try to control my thoughts."
AskTrollX,385ea5,river_trail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:36:04 2015 UTC,"This isn't so much that ""I have sexy thoughts about other people"", and more ""I think I might actually be gay/bisexual and am disappointed that I'll never get to find out because I'm with you""."
AskTrollX,385ea5,milgrams-shock,2,Tue Jun 2 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Regarding the bisexual thing, I've never been with a woman yet pretty sure I'm bi, and in  a long term relationship with a dude. I sometimes think 'I have never experienced women!' and I get sad because I do want to and I'm curious etc but in the end what I've never had I won't miss and in the end I want to be happy and he makes me happy. The satisfaction/curiosity doesn't win over losing the best person I know, and over time I have accepted the fact and I'm OK with it. I don't know if this helps you, just wanted to share in case it does."
AskTrollX,385ea5,koalaw,2,Tue Jun 2 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"How is communication with your bf? Because I'm a guy and I have to tell you, if a gf told me this, I would honestly want to talk about, make her feel better, and probably have some things to say she hasn't thought of. This may not be the solution, but you know your bf and your relationship, and if it can handle this deep of a talk. As you move forward in a relationship, hopefully you become better at helping each other deal with stress. This could be part of that for him. I also agree with everyone else, calm down, and try not to worry. Im sure your bf really cares about you."
AskTrollX,385ea5,goodoldfreda,2,Tue Jun 2 09:57:40 2015 UTC,"Communication is generally good, I mean except for the fact that I'm only really getting used to communicating issues since we started dating, before that I typically just kept it in so it's definitely something I need to work on I guess lol."
AskTrollX,385ea5,stinkyandlulu,2,Wed Jun 3 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"Well I definitely think that you should listen to everyone else here. I think you're really nervous, which is likely to happen with a big commitment like this. But you really seem to care about him, and I'm sure he cares about you too.  But I thought maybe it would be a good idea if you were to talk to him about this. Maybe not go as in depth as you did here if you're not ready, or tell him everything. But he is 50% of this relationship and you are experiencing some difficulty. And I've always believed that couples should be there to help eachother through the rough parts. Goodluck, and do what your heart tells you :)"
AskTrollX,383nq1,lordofthelentils,95,Mon Jun 1 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is not a good sign. He's already having meltdowns and separation anxiety and you're not even dating. You need to talk to him and find out why he's feeling that way.   However, do not let yourself be manipulated into guilt either."
AskTrollX,383nq1,Panic_Mechanic,27,Mon Jun 1 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Listen to this person OP! I was once in a very similar situation, & when I officially ended things after dating pretty casually for about a month he tried to kill himself by throwing himself off a 3 story building.  He was committed for several weeks, called me constantly from the mental hospital to tell me all the ways in which I was responsible for his total breakdown.   Police had to become involved, it was extremely ugly.   Not at all saying your guy is  seriously mentally ill like in my example, but what OP describes definitely should be...watched carefully."
AskTrollX,383nq1,immigrantpatriot,3,Mon Jun 1 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"That sounds so absolutely horrible, I hope you're all alright with that now. My guy (at the moment) doesn't seem to be that unstable but I'm definitely being cautious."
AskTrollX,383nq1,foxsweater,32,Tue Jun 2 06:43:53 2015 UTC,"Without a lot of context, it sounds like he might have an insecure (high anxiety-high approach) attachment style. Having a melt-down is a hyper-activating strategy; according to attachment theory, young children of inattentive parents learn to double-down on their tantrums because their parents (frequently) only acknowledge them when they're screaming. Children are utterly dependent on their parents. They learn that anything short of a full tantrum won't get their basic needs met, and unfortunately this style of behaviour can continue in adult relationships. A person with this attachment style can be very preoccupied with their relationship; they live in constant fear that they will be abandoned. Unfortunately, a lot of their behaviours (excessive jealousy; clinginess) can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy by actually driving others away.  If that's the case, you may or may not be able to reason with him, since attachment reactions can be deeply rooted in unconscious emotion. If he's open to having a conversation like u/zlpatnegam suggested, then that's a good sign. If you do begin a relationship, he may be able to learn secure attachment behaviours from you/your relationship. If he's unwilling to have a conversation about it... I would treat that as a warning sign. After all, you can't change someone; they may change themselves with some help."
AskTrollX,383nq1,TurquoiseOrange,20,Mon Jun 1 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"On a positive but still cautious note:   I am/was of an attachment type something like this. It has taken me about a decade to stop being unmanageably insecure, but I'm now a very manageable amount of insecure. My 'abandonment' type issue rarely flares up, and when it does I am able to recognise it within myself, acknowledge it, and request additional reassurance like ""I know everything is ok really, but I feel scared and I don't feel like everything ok, can has extra cuddles please? Go easy on me right now.""   On the advice of how to deal with it side:   Steer away from rejections and treating him harshly if you're really interested. If you want to give him constructive feed back that sounds great. Somethign like ""You're reaction to this is quite strong. I'm a little concerned that x, y, z or q. Don't worry I still like you. Hopefully you'll feel better later. Please try not to a, b, c just because you're feeling insecure though, I'm living my life and in many ways it's a really positive thing for me to be going away.""   When you have a person with an insecure (sometimes known as type C, I think this is roughly what is discussed above) attachment style and you push them away you push that button and make them worse. On the other hand usually when you allow a person to act out unhealthy behaviours without challenging them at all you enable bad behaviours and potentially take on excessive responsibility for their emotions. My tactic in this instance would generally be to be sure to acknowledge and validate their feelings (especially when the person is expressing them clearly, with words) and then be sure to explain your concerns or anything that you find unreasonable about their behaviour. If needed clearly ask them to stop doing something. If not needed clearly tell them what is and isn't ok, maybe use a little humour to say you see they are hurting and distract them. If possible reassurance and reality might be able to be combined. Something like ""Tehe, you really are having some feelings about this! But you know I'll come back, don't you? Lol we barely know each other.... and yet I am still here talking to you about this, not running for the hills just because you're a guy who's expressing your feelings!!""  What's reasonable is subjective. Sometimes people who need more independance date people who are way clingy, it leads to some crazy push/pull action/drama. The one makes the other worse. Viccious cycles shouldn't be hot, but sometimes people seem to think they are. In a good and healthy relationship there is generally some common ground of what is reality, what is reasonable, and was it managable. If these don't match up for you and him and he feels his behaviour and reaction are entirely normal and you don't then you don't seem compatible.  Sumary: Don't dismis. Don't push away. Don't let him walk all over you. Don't take responsibility (except for yourself, your sensitivities). Express your feelgins, positive and negative. Remember there is time and don't push yourself or settle for a conclusion that you aren't comfortable with. Acknowledge reality. Expect him to be aware of something that you can mutually agree to be close to 'reality'."

Honestly, the start of a new relationship when there's so much excitement and chemistry and potential can be really infatuating.. So maybe his judgment is a bit clouded by all that?"

Some of them are worse than others. I can see why the secretary thing happens, because when I first started about ten weeks ago, my job was to answer the phone and make tickets. But that was because I was new and not because I am a girl. I try not to take it too personally. Mostly when they find out that I'm a tech, they're happy to work with me.   The flirty ones are mostly annoying. Sometimes I put the ones who are seriously guilty of m'ladying/flirting on speakerphone and make my manager or coworkers (they are all male) listen to it, which is hilarious, because they are all like ""DO YOU PUT UP WITH THIS EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE?"" My coworkers/manager/the company in general is very supportive and won't put up with a lot of bullshit, and encourage all the employees to come forward with concerns/problems. We were told specifically (as new people, there was another person who started in my department about the same time that I did) that if we have any difficult clients or field techs that we feel like we can't work with to forward the call to management and they will take care of it.

I've only had one guy get flirty with me and it was some uber-redneck guy who wasn't even a customer (he was applying for a job) and he kept going on about how hot it was that I know my way around under the hood and the only other woman he knows like that is his butch cousin or something.

When I told him that I don't read the plans or specs for the jobs (as doing that is HIS job, and would mean I had no time to make the calls I was assigned to make), he responded with ""I bet all those plans and specs are confusing for you, huh?""  I kindly and gently corrected him with, ""Actually, my dad and I designed and implemented home improvement projects in the summers, and my grandfather was a shop teacher.

I went to therapy for a few months, but felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with my counselor. This was just my experience though, and I think seeing someone else might have helped.  I've also tried yoga and meditation, but I felt like I was faking it, it didn't feel natural or comforting to me, it just fueled my anxiety because I was just there with my thoughts.   What helped me was shifting my attention to new interests, sort of like a reset to my default brain patterns. Do you have any time to explore different hobbies for a while? Maybe cut down on one of your volunteering gigs for a while and try something new. I also feel less anxious around other people. Maybe spending more time with friends would help you as well.

Sorry for the dad-joke, but I think that's the best way to learn to love/like/respect yourself. One day, one gesture at a time. Celebrate small victories, see how those small victories stack up, and reflect on how you contributed to those victories.   An easy example (again, because you've posted about it) is that you've made it this far in your university career. No one did that for you. You're at this point because you've put in the time/effort to do your schoolwork. I know it's easy to get bogged down because you're (presumably) surrounded by other people who are also doing their schoolwork, but realize that your hard work and tenacity put you in a very small group of people when you get outside your program (or even your university).   Also: I realize that getting a job is a daunting, scary thing -- but you will get there. And completing your schoolwork is an important step to getting there. So try not to let your worry about something a little farther down the road (getting a job) sabotage the thing you need to get down to that point in the road (finishing schoolwork)."
AskTrollX,380x3f,CHClClCl,6,Mon Jun 1 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Gosh, it sounds like even your therapist is stressing you out! Is self-esteem a thing one either has, or does not have? To me, it seems like something that can fade sometimes, but then come back at others. It's not an 'absolute' state to be in - it's natural to esteem yourself highly when you're doing well in life, but then lose that esteem if you feel you've done or are doing badly. IMO, self-esteem is transitory, so not reliable to base your life decisions on.  Instead, self-love is something you can always have for yourself, whether you're on top of the world and winning at everything, or down in the dumps because life keeps handing you lemons at the time. If you work on truly 'loving' yourself, you'll naturally be more forgiving of the stumbles you make in life, and feel calm and confident that no matter how bad you might presently feel about things, you know you'll ultimately make the right decision out of respect for yourself.  It's great that you've committed to long-term therapy to solve the underlying causes of your anxiety and self esteem issues. I've read a lot about mindfulness meditation being especially helpful in dealing with anxiety. What you've described sounds quite severe, however, and I'm wondering whether you're also taking medication to treat your symptoms. If not, I'd recommend seeing your doctor to discuss what medical treatment options may be available to help you deal with your immediate problems, while still continuing with the therapy."
AskTrollX,380x3f,Crivens1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"thanks, that makes sense.  I am working on self compassion and self care - I think that's what self esteem is.  Confidence is the thing that is transitory and dependent on the highs and lows of life- I think  I want to take meds kinda but I find that I am sensitive to the side effects of ma ny anti anxiety medications, because I have whatm y doctor calls 'treatment resistant depression' which means that I need a huge dose of meds for it to work - make it much more likely that I will suffer from side effects. :("
AskTrollX,380x3f,Knyxie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess the term 'self-esteem' has developed a more nuanced meaning than its literal one. There are times when it's totally healthy to not 'esteem' one's own behaviour - after losing one's temper during an argument, for example - but it's still possible to maintain self-love (self compassion as you've said) and work through the temporary discomfort of feeling guilt or shame over one's own poor behaviour, and hopefully learn and grow from the experience, instead of getting bogged down in unhelpful, negative inner dialogue over the matter.  Interestingly, people often assume that aggressive, spiteful, 'bully' types must act the way they do due to low self-esteem, but the opposite is usually true. High self-esteem is often coupled with a high sense of entitlement, but it may not always be deserved. People who esteem themselves highly and expect others to do so can easily become incensed by what they consider unworthy treatment by others who don't share their lofty opinions of themselves. It's a defining trait of narcissistic personality types, (and sociopaths, too, from memory).  Self compassion is a preferable trait, IMO, because the capacity to feel compassion for oneself will naturally extend to feeling and acting compassionately towards others, also. Self-esteem, not so much! There are plenty of people in the world who don't deserve anyone's esteem, but very few (none?) who don't deserve at least some compassion.   Nevertheless, self-esteem is a mostly a positive trait, and it and self-confidence are definitely worthwhile cultivating in yourself. Being able to deal easily with stressful social and general life situations with confidence will obviously help alleviate your anxiety levels.  The right medication could work wonders for you in this regard, and give you the support and relief from your symptoms, which would expedite your progress in your behavioural therapy. I suffer treatment resistant depression myself, and after some research, I read about this drug combo which has been found so effective it's been dubbed California rocket fuel. Now, I'm not trying to suggest that it would be suitable for you, but that sometimes doctors need to be prepared to be a little creative with medications, and experiment to get the right dose, type, and combo for treatment to be effective. Most regular GPs don't specialise in these things, and just stick with the same, rigid, cookie-cutter approach to all their patients with nominally similar symptoms.   There are docs who are much more knowledgeable about psychiatric medications, and are confident and experienced enough to deviate from the norm as required. I see one such GP myself, but have a follow up consult once a year with a psychiatrist also. Please, continue informing yourself as much as possible and keep searching for a satisfactory solution until you've got one. You're at least some of the way there, but clearly still struggling with some acute symptoms which sound like they're wreaking havoc on your life. Your illness is not being treated effectively if this is the 'best you can expect' from your current treatment plan."
AskTrollX,380x3f,milkradio,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:06:04 2015 UTC,"California rocket fuel:       “California rocket fuel” is a medical slang term for the combined administration of Mirtazapine (a NaSSA) and Venlafaxine (an SNRI).  This combination is usually used in the treatment of severe and/or treatment-resistant depression and has superior efficacy to tranylcypromine, though this advantage was not statistically significant, with fewer side effects and better tolerability.  However, when used as an initial treatment, the mirtazapine and venlafaxine combination resulted in more than twice the remission rate of single antidepressant therapy.

( um. no thanks. ) whenever I have them especially bad, I wean myself off the caffiene, sugar and alcohol and give myself boob massages with coconut oil and they get better for a little while but then I forget and get back on all those lovely substances untill it gets bad again. I try to go braless as much as possible, which is difficult as I'm pretty big chested (DD+) but I'm starting to give less of a fuck and just let my ladies be free. it's better for your lymph nodes and shit to go braless, helps with drainage and such ( I think?). It's just kind of a really crappy juggling act, but your best bet is lay off the caffiene and alcohol, manage your stress, frequent boob massages, and naproxen or advil when things are really rough. I'm not sure if that's really the most effective but it's the way I've learned to deal with it personally.

Though, it is getting quite a pounding, as it's an art installation and running pretty much constantly while it's on display, which would make a thick piece of meat thinner over time."
AskTrollX,37x7to,WhatWasThatAbout,1 point,Sun May 31 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"Is it really an art installation? The background and setting seem pretty casual to me, as thought it's just something weird someone set up in their house for the internet. But you've seen the video and I'm just looking at the gif haha  If it is an art installation/running a long time, it would take a really long time to wear down a tongue. And there's no sign of that on the phone or the setup, it's all pretty clean. Plus to get a tongue that thin, the time it would take would ensure the meat wouldn't look nearly that fresh."
AskTrollX,37x7to,juckele,3,Sun May 31 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, it is an art installation and it doesn't look nearly as clean from other angles. But no, you're totally right, It would be a wimpy tongue and my imagination got the best of me. :P"

AskTrollX,37x7to,scosgurl,4,Mon Jun 1 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"In my experience Tinder has guys who are not over their last relationship yet but think they are, or guys who just aren't looking for anything serious. I've met several guys from there and none of them have been emotionally available.  Also lots of people who match with you and then don't talk. Makes me think they just want you for their trophy cabinet. I've deleted my account, it's not going to yield a quality relationship."
AskTrollX,37x7to,mudcelt,1 point,Sun May 31 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"As a guy, I will match with someone and not talk if nothing interesting is happening in their pictures and they don't have any interesting text in their profile."
AskTrollX,37x7to,PandaPoot,3,Sun May 31 13:31:23 2015 UTC,I've had two relationships blossom out of Plenty of Fish. I'd say I recommend them.
AskTrollX,37x7to,arrozc0nleche,3,Sun May 31 11:53:26 2015 UTC,"When I checked out PoF about 3 years back I couldn't stand their interface. It was so stupidly cluttered & difficult to navigate, especially in contrast to OkCupid. And you had to pay for stupid stuff, like being able to reply to someone's message. I rage quit very quickly. I'm curious: have you tried OkCupid? If so, why do you prefer PoF? (I promise I'm not shilling for OkC, just genuinely curious)"
AskTrollX,37x7to,maziarzreboot,2,Sun May 31 13:24:06 2015 UTC,"I was on both OKC and POF both times I was single. I guess my main preference was for the user base and the type of people I talked to. The guys I spoke to on OKC were very focused on sex and hookups. This was less prevalent on POF. Also, I know both websites have options to pay and upgrade your experience, but I never had to pay to message anyone on either site. For reference, I used them first during summer 2012 and again about two months ago."
AskTrollX,37x7to,mudcelt,1 point,Sun May 31 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your response. I wonder if our different experiences have to do with a difference in our ages? (I'm 51, so was late 40s when using dating sites). I found that guys who had taken the time to make full profile on OkC were pretty serious about wanting to be in a relationship and it was much easier to get a sense of what they were looking for on OkC than it was with PoF, which seemed to be full of married guys looking for something on the side, something I wouldn't learn about them til after we'd already been talking or texting, or in one memorable case, after we'd had a face to face meeting.  On both sites there were guys who were poly or just straight up cheating (seems to be a theme as you get older- my dating matra used to be 'single for a reason') but on OkC men seemed to be much more honest about it. OkC was structured so you could put information about stuff like that right up front, and I appreciated that.   I suspect for me it was a combination of my demographic and the cluttered visual nature of the PoF website that turned me off of it.   That, and being annoyed by having to 'upgrade' my free membership to be able to respond to messages on PoF, which I didn't need to do with OkC.   shrugs In the end, each site worked for us, right?! We got that going for us, which IS nice!"
AskTrollX,37x7to,lem0nster,3,Sun May 31 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"I met my husband on OkC. I messaged him, and eventually asked him out. I've found that you have the most success when you're assertive sending instead of passively accepting.   I met a TON of great guys by messaging first."
AskTrollX,37x7to,katicarza,2,Sun May 31 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"Every guy I met and liked, I messaged first. My boyfriend actually said he would NEVER ask the girl out first and it worked out well for him."

We were on opposite sides of the continent when we met, he moved here a year ago & we haven't looked back.   Before I met him, I was single and actively looking for  about two years (with a 9 month pause for a relationship that didn't work out). OkCupid was really the only viable option for someone in my age range at that time, though I think if I were single now I'd at least check out tinder."

It's tinder like in the manner that you don't get to message unless you connect, but it's more for people looking for relationships than hookups.   I've meet a few decent dates on it. The lack of success is more on my end than anything else. There's not much on the Ace-specific dating scene..."

I've tried Craigslist, PoF, OkC, and Tinder, and OkC was by far the one with the most articulate users which is a big turn on for me."
AskTrollX,37x7to,Thepeacepoem,1 point,Sun May 31 13:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm on just about all of them.   Match is expensive, but it's a good way to avoid people who aren't serious, or are only looking for a hook-up. The downside is that you don't know who is and isn't a paid subscriber, and you need to be a paid subscriber in order to read messages.  POF has tons of guys on it in my area, but it's harder to tell if they're going to be a good match.  OKC is nice because of the question matching, but in my area it isn't super popular.  Tinder is fun and popular but again, pretty one-track in my experience."
AskTrollX,37vxmw,Quasi-Existence,34,Sat May 30 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"No. I have the opposite problem. Being so heavily involved in feminist communities like TrollX makes me feel ashamed that I want to be hairless. I don't feel like I feel any pressure to shave, I'd proudly strut my stuff without shaving, but I genuinely find it to be more physically comfortable and visually attractive on myself."

They're all supporting each other doing something that goes against social norms, and I'm happy for them and me butting in being like ""well I LIKE shaving"" is just pointlessly contrarian. I have all the support I need, they don't.  I'm actually paying to get my legs and bikini lazered this year, I found an amazing deal so I decided it was time. Time to be smooth forever."
AskTrollX,37vxmw,coralto,2,Tue Jun 2 08:17:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It just becomes a problem when someone runs around with the ""I'm a better feminist than you"" attitude because you subscribe to certain feminine norms they don't."
AskTrollX,37vxmw,kmm91,22,Wed Jun 3 06:19:27 2015 UTC,"I stopped caring a few years ago. I wear skirts and dresses on an almost daily basis, so I used to shave my legs every day for fear that someone might notice stubble. Then life happened. I got busy and stopped caring... and yet I still got compliments on my outfits and appearance. That was a magical learning moment for me: People don't really look that closely at the details of others. People notice facial expressions, hairstyles, and overall ensembles, not the amount of leg hair that you neglected to remove this week. I do still shave if my gentleman friend will be around or if there is likely to be contact between a person and my legs... but even then I forget sometimes. My gentleman friend refers to my legs as ""nopalitas"" (little cacti) and he touches me anyway. The world does not end; he still likes me just as much as when my legs are smooth. So, at this point, I would say I'm pretty comfortable with my body hair and I have found a shaving schedule that fits my needs."
AskTrollX,37vxmw,mmwright82,12,Sat May 30 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"So I'm probably going to be the minority here     I'm horrified by my hair. Horrified. I'm mostly Sicilian. We are a furry people. I'm just enough ""other"" (Northern Italian, English, Irish, who knows) that I have pale skin. So I have thick dark coarse hair that you can see from a mile away. It's a constant source of embarrassment. I wear long sleeves and jeans year round and can't remember the last time I wore a bikini to the beach (basketball shorts and t short kind of gal). Actually, now that I think of it, I can tan to a nice caramelly brown, but I never do, cos I'm never exposed enough.   I shave/pluck/wax everything. Seriously. Legs. Arms. Armpits. Stomach. Lady bits. Tops of feet/toes. Everything else. Fully shaving (say if I haven't for two-three weeks because I'm sick) will completely exhaust a brand new razor. I have horrifically sensitive skin, so rashes and irritation are a constant thing in conjunction with the hair removal.   When I was just about 12 or so, my older sister made fun of my arm hair. So shaving my arms became a compulsion that I've now had for over a decade. I can't stop it. From there, it spiralled further out of control. I literally get distracted about it in public/social situations. Like oh shit I haven't gotten my eyebrows done lately and she's just staring at that and my jeans are cuffed over a couple times and even though I shaved earlier you can see the hair through my skin so it looks like five o clock shadow even though I'm in the couple hour grace period where I actually feel smooth kind of stuff.   The thing is, I am actually really comfortable with my body otherwise. I look good in bikinis, I can rock a miniskirt or minidress, whatever. I've got an hourglass figure that is to die for (my mom tells me she's jealous basically every time we talk). But I'm always dressed kinda loose and frumpy so it's not obvious that I'm a fuzz ball.   If I had three wishes, one of them would be to remove all of my hair save brows/lashes/scalp type hair. Seriously. I'd get rid of all nuclear/atomic/whatever weapons, fix the goddamn environment, and get rid of my excess body hair.   I've asked every doctor I've ever had about it and it's sounding like my best option would be electrolysis or laser removal. It's expensive. I have tricare (military insurance) so I doubt they'd cover even a portion of it. I keep telling myself that if I ever publish a book, I'll spoil myself by defurring some.   So yeah. Ashamed like you wouldn't believe. Wish there was a way I didn't feel like I have to hate it so much :-/"
AskTrollX,37vxmw,ItsReeney,10,Sun May 31 01:33:18 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly Sicilian. We are a furry people.   Oh, this cracked me up so hard. I'm half Sicilian and I guess my mom's genes mostly won out in the hair arena because I am not super furry. I have some patches of hair in weird places (I have a happy trail!) but nothing that is visible when I'm dressed. I have to shave my boobs though, because it just weirds me out that I get coarse body hair on them. No unibrow or other weird facial hair though. My sister has whiskers.  I shave my legs and I don't feel like it's a non-feminist. I like it when they feel soft and silky. I like to put coconut oil or a solid lotion on them afterward and they feel so great!  Sorry you're furry, but I really think you could write a book because I love the way you write! There's hope!"

I just have the super thick head hair (and eyebrows, sexy unibrow if I don't wax) and a bit of a lady stache, but my other hair is pretty light (where the Irish half comes in) so I shave maybe a few times a month, and pretty much never during the winter.  My fiancé is also half Irish half Italian but his body hair is just bizarre. He is like a half-transformed werewolf. His upper body is absolutely hairless, but then his legs are crazy hairy except for his butt. It is like he has hair chaps on, haha!"

I was teased for being hairy when I was younger too, and I'm really struggling to get over the hate I feel for my body when I have hair everywhere. It really doesn't help being a hairy person and being told by much less hairy people that not shaving is totally fine and you will look just as nice with hair, because I look at my pale skin and dark hair and feel horrible.   I've really been trying lately to stop feeling so angry at myself though. I'm happy with the idea of shaving being ok with my feminist views, since it's an aesthetic choice I'm making for myself, but I do want to be able to feel comfortable in my skin when I haven't shaved too. It sounds weird but I've found that waxing or epilating my leg hair helps me feel better about it when it grows back because it is less dark, and that lets me go for much longer without feeling uncomfortable with myself. It's not a perfect solution but for now it means I am much happier with myself for more of the time."

I haven't used it enough to recommend it or not, but it sounds like it might help. From my research, it's slower and less effective a going to a pro. It's also not cheap, but it is way less expensive than going to a spa. I think there are other brands, tria is the big fancy one, I think.

I think of it as similar to wearing make up. I think it improves my appearance and makes me look a little more ""done up"" or formal, but if I don't feel like doing it, I'm fine going out in public without bothering. I admit though, I used to be really self conscious about it. I think I only got comfortable when I starting living with my bf and realized I wasn't going to shave every time I saw him, like I used to. At first I was self conscious when I was stubbly around him; he didn't care. As I realized he didn't care, I starting caring less, and lazziness led me to shaving less often, and getting more comfortable with a tiny bit of fuzz.  If you want to try and get a bit more comfortable, try going without once in a while. Book your next waxing session a week later than your normally would have, and just wear capris while getting groceries one day. You'll notice that no one notices. Slowly push yourself out of your comfort zone, and you'll see a lot of people won't even look at you differently."
AskTrollX,37vxmw,el_nynaeve,10,Sat May 30 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it, and it only took me forty years and going bald!   I grew up never letting my arms or legs or bikini line grow out. I was a serious swimmer, and I had thick, wavy, long beautiful hair. It was probably my best feature, to this day my mother will run into people who worked at my elementary school and they'll ask her if I still have my ""crowning glory.""  Anyway, some years ago, due to illness, I started losing my hair. I spent a few years crying over it and trying to hide it, until I shaved it on a whim for a charity thing. I realized that I'm a lot more comfortable with it off (and while I do have wigs when I want to pass for normal, I go months and months without wearing one) than trying to hide it. And my partner think it's cute. So I'm permanently bald.   This ended up having repercussions with my body hair. Once I stopped bothering with the head hair, bothering with the body hair seemed odd, so I stopped, and grew out everything for the first time since I started puberty.   And you know, while I'm not super hairy, the hair I do have is kind of....cute. I like it, especially my armpits. I'm perfectly comfortable with it and I don't give a rusty goddamn about what other people think of it. It took me losing the hair that is associated with femininity and attractiveness to warm up to the hair that isn't. I think this also correlates with aging as well, I'm more comfortable with my body and my self in general.  This is probably the very best thing about aging. That and not having to keep a menstrual calendar. That fucking rocks as well."

But then I remember it's just an opinion that everyone has a right to, and that's okay! No one has ever said anything negative to me about it though, because it's really just an unreasonable thing to confront someone about so I'll be surprised if I ever do receive a negative comment about it.

I buzz down my pubes mostly for my partners, otherwise I'd never bother.  I think pit bush is sexy, though, so I've been growing it out for a long time now.  The only problem I run into there is that regular deodorant doesn't do the best job with long pit hair, so I use a mix of coconut oil and baking soda to keep it soft and smelling good."

If I haven't waxed, I instantly feel less secure; less confident with myself, even though all of my body is still covered in clothes. It is crazy. Sometimes I have dreams where I am in bikini or underwear, with my legs and parts in their natural state, and people point at me with despise.  I know it has to do with accepting oneself as one is; with hair, imperfect skin and stretch marks. But it is difficult for me, at least.

There's nothing wrong with dressing how you want in your own home. Next, go outside in a full outfit. Nobody's going to notice. Honestly. Try some short sleeves or some cropped trousers. People don't notice then either. Even if they do, who cares? People will always find fault in your appearance . Gradually work your way up. You'll be rocking a bikini in no time! :)  Some reassurance: I've found that people care much less than I thought they would (read: not at all)- though, to be fair, my hair's fairly light."

Now that it's summer, I'm thinking about it, but my leg hair is pretty soft & sparse. So it's kind of a fun trick to play on people - oh, you think I'm commercial? BAM. Leg hair in your face!!  For pubes, I used to buzz them down regularly. Even got a Brazilian once. Then I let them grow out and realized that having an itchy crotch wasn't normal.

AskTrollX,37vxmw,lovekeepsherintheair,2,Sun May 31 08:34:33 2015 UTC,"I went through a shitty breakup about a year ago, and pretty much stopped all shaving at that point. It helped that we were headed into winter at that time... so I didn't really feel the 'need' to shave.   I think shaved legs (on me) looks nicer than otherwise, because I have a lot of hair on my legs. It's pretty dark, and while the individual hairs aren't thick... the concentration of them is pretty impressive. I can only use a razor-refill once before they're dull (both legs shaved ankle to mid-thigh), I've tried both men's and women's replacement blades. So... actually shaving for me is a 'special occasion' kind of thing.   These days, for comfort, I use a beard trimmer with the guard removed to take off the bulk of the hair off my legs... I leave the stubble. I'm not really interested in dating these days anyway, so if anyone is close enough to feel the stubble, they're too close as far as I'm concerned. I forget about my armpits all the time, unless it's really hot out. Then I find underarm hair uncomfortable (and it makes it so deodorant doesn't work as well), so again sometimes I shave it for comfort. I do the lady bits more regularly than anything for this reason.   I've never really thought about how few fucks I give about shaving my body hair... interesting question, great post!"
AskTrollX,37vxmw,TrishyMay,2,Sun May 31 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"It's a struggle. I generally feel pretty cool about it now, but I was much more conflicted when I was younger. I'm 26 now and shaved for the first time at 13. I more or less stopped after a couple years. It was just social pressure to shave before going swimming that I ever did it. If I get an urge, I'll shave at most once a year or so? I just asked my fiance if I'd ever shaved since I met him (2.5 years) and he said, ""Besides your head? No."" So that's that, lol.    I still wear tank tops and dresses. I'm occasionally a little self conscious, but mostly I don't give a fuck. If I'm being really honest I probably do think that smooth or lightly haired bodies are more conventionally attractive, but I don't think my body is meant for decoration! If I don't have the self interest to shave and my partner doesn't care, why should I shave just to make other people feel more comfortable? It's the same way I feel about makeup. I will wear lipstick or at a stretch eyeliner every couple months maybe. I do it when I feel like being fancy, or when I just wake up and want to be a princess. I would never do it on a daily basis because I'm lazy, I don't give a shit, and it would be doing it to please other people over myself and I'm not about that.    The main most important thing is to do whatever you want to do. It takes some time to have the self confidence to do that, and no one is perfect all the time. Rock whatever makes you feel comfortable and happy. And if you want fuzzy legs, go for it!"

AskTrollX,37vxmw,goodoldfreda,2,Mon Jun 1 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"For me, it's mostly because my SO is perfectly okay with it and my legs and pits are usually pretty covered when I'm out. My aversion to shaving is mostly caused by the time it takes and my tiny shower, so I only shave my armpits when it's long enough to notice if I'm wearing a tee shirt, and my legs only on the rare occasions I wear shorts or dresses without tights. I just don't wear things that show off my legs much, so it's not a big deal. I don't really care what most people think of my body, and if anyone said anything to me about it I'd just say that shaving is hard and there's nothing wrong with body hair. So basically I just have an IDGAF attitude. Not that that helps."

I also have a horrible habit (condition?) of falling asleep driving long distances. I used to have to make four hour drives visiting home and within 15 minutes I'd start nodding off at the wheel. Thank goodness for the rumble strip. Unfortunately, I don't have a way to keep it down/reduce it. My husband drives 99% of the time as he knows how uncomfortable I get driving.

AskTrollX,37uzwy,JamesTiberiusChirp,3,Sun May 31 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"You might consider going talking to a doctor about your tendency to fall asleep at the wheel. There's a lot of different medical conditions that can cause that.  My dad had sleep apnea and the first sign that he basically couldn't ignore was that he was falling asleep at the wheel- I think he just didn't notice the other symptoms because he had gotten used to them. Then of course there's also narcolepsy and a handful of other hypersomnias.  Probably you're fine, but it's one of those things that shouldn't be ignored."
AskTrollX,37uzwy,JamesTiberiusChirp,3,Sun May 31 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's completely normal to feel a little anxious while driving. After all, you are in what is basically a death machine doing the most dangerous activity the average person will do in their lifetime. A close relative of mine started getting panic attacks while driving, and it is apparently very common. You are already on edge a bit, and there's something about the stimulus of everything moving towards you that contributes to the panic attack.  That said, panic attacks and anxiety are a weird thing that have physical symptoms -- hyperventilation, high heart rate -- but can also be triggered by those physical sensations. Focusing on your breath, breathe deeply, slowly, and steadily. Try doing some breathing or meditation exercises before driving, and if you find yourself getting anxious behind the wheel, refocus your breath.  My relative eventually got over his panic attacks. After a hiatus of driving, he started driving short distances at first, and never alone in case someone needed to take control of the wheel. He always kept Gatorade and snacks in reach in the car in case his blood sugar got low -- low blood sugar can make people feel shakey and woozy, which for him and others can make you feel anxious and panicky, triggering an attack. Eventually he started driving further and further, and as of now hasn't had a problem in a good long time.  I would try doing something similar. Start with short trips with your SO and gradually increase the distance. It might help to drive the same route daily, maybe doing the same path that your big trip starts on. You'll hopefully start getting more comfortable behind the wheel.   My last bit of advice is to not treat driving like a game. Don't be aggressive or worry about passing people or getting from point a to point b as fast/efficiently as possible. Be defensive, be safe, take your time (but also be assertive when you need to be, it can be dangerous to not commit to a merge, for example. Make sure all decisions are deliberate). Gamifying the drive creates stress, which I believe contributed to my relative's driving anxiety. Do your best to relax and focus on a safe and comfortable ride. Don't be intimidated by other drivers.  I hope that helps!  Edit: just want to add, that it's always good to have an ""escape route"" while driving. What that means is don't let cars box you in, don't tailgate, and try to avoid driving in the packs that form on the highway, and have a safe way to pull over whenever you can. Having an escape plan gives you a sense of control, and knowing you can safely pull over if need be can be very comforting."

I'm glad your relative hasn't had any problems in a while. :) That's what I aspire to do.   I think having snacks and breathing will help me a lot. That sounds like exactly what I need.

Roll your hands/ankles/shoulders around every once in a while to loosen things up (and stopping to stand up every hour or two is also a good idea). My bro would get so tense his hands would tingle, and the tingling sensation would also set off the panic attacks (another symptom/trigger combo is tingling/numbness)."

Also, every so often, consciously relax your grip on the steering wheel. Little bio feedbacks like that can help your body to calm down the adrenaline rush it's giving you. If you can, put the radio on and sing, or talk to your navigator. Concentrating too hard can sometimes make it worse because you focus on just how nervous you are!

For long drives like OP's upcoming move, my boyf and I will pick some audiobooks and listen to them along the way.  We can pause them for bathroom breaks and discussion as needed or when the traffic gets dicey, we can change them if we get tired of them, or we can listen all the way through.  OP, I've also had success with chewing gum when I start feeling anxious while driving - it may or may not work for you, but it's worth a shot!

I think the fancy psychological term is ""a state of flow.""  the thing is, before you can hit that point you have to get comfortable enough with driving that you're not freaking the fuck out about the task at hand. you said you're pretty confident so I wouldn't worry about this too much. it would probably be good for you to make some smaller highway trips, though, because it seemed like that's what you like the least. experience is really the best thing. I don't think you can expect yourself to just will all your discomfort away. so get yourself in the fast lane! :P  also, try not to be too hard on yourself. being present is very important. I know I used to get so upset about making some little mistake that I'd get distracted and do more dumb things and get more freaked out. it was a bad feedback loop. take deep breaths and tell yourself you'll do better next time. and then focus on what's in front of you again.

AskTrollX,37uzwy,oxosmooches,2,Sat May 30 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"Last year I did a 1200 mile journey across 3 countries and I hyped myself up about all too. Never been nervous but it just seemed like a lot! I actually mostly enjoyed it (related notes: Italian drivers are crazy, the Pyrenees is scary and the children drove me insane for the last 100 miles!) and I'm doing it again this year. I did some of these things though.   A playlist of songs that you can sing along to but not have to think about the lyrics can help (if that makes sense!). Keeps the mind from thinking about every terrible 'what if' scenario.  You should take your time and not feel the need to rush just because you're on the highway. Obviously don't drive at 30mph (unless that's the speed limit or the weather is terrible) but build up to a speed you're comfortable with and keep with it. Just because there are people behind you, you don't need to rush. They can overtake if they want to.  Find some cool places to stop on en route and just make it to these points. This breaks up the journey a bit and doesn't seem as daunting as a journey of over 1000 miles. It's a lot easier to know you've got 200 miles till there's a nice place for a picnic than just driving constantly and stopping anytime. Related to above is when you stop, have a stretch, do a mini mediation, get some air. You'll fell much better for it. I would splash some cool water on my face, put on some more deodorant, have a drink so I felt more human. Walkie talkies might be an idea as a way of communicating whilst on the move. Granted last time I did this was as a convoy of 7 cars all full to the brim so the driver never have a use them. I wouldn't say use them all the time whilst driving but they might be an idea. Driving long distance you might lose signal on phones and it's a useful way of communicating if you need to.   Once you've done it you'll be really proud of yourself, and you'll be able to take over the world! Well. Sort of."

If you feel uncomfortable with the question, just tell him/her so. Don't lie. Just tell the truth: ""yeah, I don't feel like talking about that, it's complicated.""  Supposedly, therapists are bound to keep everything you talk between the two of you, so you have to build a relationship based on trust. Maybe, in future sessions, you will feel capable of talking on that particular topic with him/her you didn't feel capable of addressing before. It is a slow process (but very rewarding to your personal growth).  If in your first session you feel that the therapist is not respecting your stance (e.g., pushing and ""forcing"" you to talk about something you don't feel like talking just out of the blue) or you get the gut feeling that you are not being ""understood"", then maybe you should try another person.

AskTrollX,37vg1u,crumpledlife,3,Sun May 31 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"I've had a few therapists/psychologists, and what I've learned is that you should ask a few initial questions in order to establish certain vital shared values.   ""Do you believe faith in God is a necessary ingredient in healing for all of your patients?"" This will weed out those who use therapy to push their own beliefs. The best answer is one which talks about how therapy should be tailored to the individual, how faith can help the faithful, but it's by no means a universal treatment. Plenty of religious therapists treat nonreligious patients and visa versa without any issue.   ""What are the potential risks of transference?"" This will weed out pervs, which I've had a problem with before. It's possible for psychologists to use transference unethically, to drive the patient not towards healing but being manipulated for the psychologist's personal ends. This is thankfully rare, so please don't let this make you feel distrustful of all psychologists, but asking the question will keep a psychologist on their toes.   ""What method do you normally use to help patients with [insert the reason you're in therapy here]?"" This will weed out therapists who think their knowledge gives them power, who separate themselves from the patients. A little intellectual ego is normal, but I'm wary of people who hoard knowledge and treat it with jealousy. Psychology isn't a secret tome locked away from the common folk. Anyone with $40 can buy a used DSM-V.   Otherwise, try to be honest with your therapist/psychologist. Most are trustworthy and capable practitioners."

It helps you track what you eat by simply scanning a bar code or searching for a food in their database, then helps you stay within healthy limits by showing you your daily goals based on your BMI. It was suggested to me by my nutritionist when I was diagnosed with diabetes, and really works well."
AskTrollX,37ssjp,LaceyGucci,5,Sat May 30 03:41:08 2015 UTC,I don''t understand how to use MFP for food I make myself. Is there some easy way to figure out the nutrition facts?
AskTrollX,37ssjp,reddidentity,13,Sat May 30 05:28:48 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of ways, depending on how you want to do it. The first would be logging each ingredient individually - this works well for a sandwich (e.g. Two slices of bread, a tablespoon of mayonnaise, two slices of ham, 2 ounces of cheese, a bit of lettuce), but might not be so easy for a more complicated recipe. For me, if it's a bit more complex (or if it is something I make all the time), I use the ""Recipes"" function and create a new recipe. You give the recipe a name, say how many people it serves, and then log every ingredient in. Once you're done, MFP automatically calculates the calories and macros for each serving. It then has the recipe saved, so any time you make it again after that, you can just log the recipe.   It's a great function; the only problem is that, once the recipe's created, you can't change any of the ingredients in it, so it only works well for recipes that you know you make the same way each time. Alternatively, if you modify the recipe (such as by adding more of a particular ingredient), you can either create a new recipe with the modifications, or, you can simply log whatever extra additions you made in the diary. So for example, if it's a Mac and cheese recipe, and one time you decide to stick in a load of extra cheese, you could just log the recipe, and then log however much extra cheese you would have got in your serving.  Hope that helps!"
AskTrollX,37ssjp,Fairleee,3,Sat May 30 07:34:52 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up that you can change a recipe later! It took me a while to find it, but it can be done.  Go to 'More' then 'My Foods and Recipes', then select the recipe and press 'Edit'.  It will only change it for future logging, so it won't change the nutrition of where you logged it previously (if that makes sense!)."
AskTrollX,37ssjp,Lemurlemurlemur,1 point,Sun May 31 12:50:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for this! I had no idea; that's really useful to know! I currently have about 4 almost identical recipes saved for the same dish because I made it slightly differently each time.

I've done some googling, but most of the things I've found seem a bit too out-there/untrustworthy and/or require materials that I do not have.

AskTrollX,37ojww,pickinguppennies,8,Fri May 29 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is my method: Green and yellow color correcting anything, I use the cheapo sticks from walgreens. Dab them on in spots over the bruise, green over red and yellow over purple/blue. Stipple/blend with fingers and/or a stippling brush. Then gently re layer once or twice, maybe.   If you have powder, apply with brush gently, and then foundation, and then more powder. (I don't always do this, because my powder and foundation oxidize a lot, especially together, and currently are the wrong colors. Depends on how badly the ""shadows"" still show, and what I can wear) Then add setting spray if desired, and if you can, wear a denim shirt with a collar, or any button up shirt that you can wear open over other clothing, weather and fashion appropriatly.    If you have primer or glitter glue, it may be useful to put those on first. Your mileage may vary. And I tend to moisturize my hickeys lightly so they don't suck up all the concealer right away.

AskTrollX,37ojww,Giraffe247,2,Fri May 29 10:12:12 2015 UTC,As far as methods to lessen the hickeys using a credit card on your skin to kinda scrape really breaks up the coloring. It sounds silly but it helps a lot if the bruise is dark. It doesn't do as much if it's a tiny hickey

Here I copied this from a random site on it:  Toothbrush / Comb Method  This method helps to break up and spread the blood around, making it easier for your body to clear away the signs of the hickey.  Take a stiff-bristled toothbrush (you can substitute with a comb) and ‘brush’ the hickey. Make sure you apply pressure, but not too much as you can end up scratching the area or causing more damage and swelling. Some people use vibrating toothbrushes.After doing this for five to ten minutes, apply a cold compress for ten minutes and then repeat as necessary."

AskTrollX,37mqf3,Certifiedpoocleaner,12,Thu May 28 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh, OP. Have definitely been there. Good on you for recognizing that this is a problem you have to face, and one you have to kind of ""figure out"" moneywise.  Here in Chicago, there are services that are offered on a sliding-scale basis - meaning you pay based on your income. Others have mentioned grad schools. Are you in school right now? If so, the school probably has resources. Do you have insurance? If so, your insurance might offer more coverage than you realize. If it doesn't, make an appointment with a general practitioner for a physical and specifically bring up these issues. Physicals are mandatorily covered under the ACA, so your insurance company can't charge you for it. Your doc may be able to provide additional resources. The ACA has provisions on mental health coverage too that could be worth looking up.  If you can (and it's okay if you can't), maybe start trying to make some small changes in your lifestyle to address the physical symptoms. Taking walks/exercising, sleeping, masturbating (what? endorphins and oxytocin!), watching funny TV or movies, and eating well helps. Above all, be kind to yourself, whatever that means to you.  If you ever get overwhelmed, here's a trick I developed that might help you too: I divide everything into small tasks and focus only on the one in front of me, like: okay, you are going to get out of the bed. Now you're out! Now you are going to go to the kitchen and pour a glass of water. Okay! Next you are going to go to the bathroom and brush your teeth. Nice! Eventually you're in your rhythm and you're moving.   I know how awful it is to be where you are right now and my heart breaks for you. But you are tough, you are strong, and you can beat the crap out of your anxiety! Make it your bitch!"
AskTrollX,37mqf3,dorothy_zbornak_esq,12,Thu May 28 21:53:05 2015 UTC,Sorry guys! I live in Denver. I'd be willing to travel as far as Co springs or ft Collins too.   I've struggled with feelings of self loathing and depressing since childhood. Lately I've been feeling a lot of anxiety and tightness in my chest. I have also been having a hard time with productiveness and finishing tasks. Sometimes I think I have ADD but maybe it has more to do with depression.   I know that these feeling aren't right. I really wish I had done something about it when we had better insurance but recently my stepdads company got bought out and our insurance is awful.   Thanks for any help

AskTrollX,37mqf3,raziphel,7,Thu May 28 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"I've struggled with anxiety and depression as well and while I ABSOLUTELY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND GETTING ONE ON ONE OR GROUP THERAPY FROM LICENSED PROFESSIONALS (or at least from folks who are supervised by licensed professionals) I've found alot of help in Al-Anon.   Al-Anon is a 12 step group focused on helping people who have family or friends who are alcoholics, but nobody checks at the door to make sure you qualify. It's a free (ok, you can voluntarily put a dollar in the basket) program and it's all about helping you learn to live as healthy a life as you can regardless of what's going on around you. Almost everyone has someone in their life who struggles with addiction and that can be your entry point, but what it comes down to is people sitting in a circle, telling their truth and listening to others tell their truth. There is something powerful about the unconditional love and support I've found in the rooms.   I started going to Al-Anon two years ago, after a nasty break-up basically incapacitated me. I don't have health insurance, and a friend suggested Al-Anon. I come from a long line of alcoholics, most prominently my father and my issues around my breakup could be traced to my relationship with my father. And I figured it was free. It might help and probably wouldn't hurt.   That was very much the case. It's changed my life, for the better. Maybe it can help you to.  TL;DR Al-Anon, not just for family and friends of alcoholics: basically free group therapy."

AskTrollX,37mlsa,natsprat,7,Thu May 28 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Rough skin like that is a way your body protects itself. Removing the thick skin without preventing the reason it happens will just have it coming back again.   Saying all that, a baby foot soak like this will remove dead skin, but it will take 7-21 days for the peeling to stop. Another option, one I've recently come to favour is this foot peeling spray which is pretty instant - spray on the area and rub then little balls of dead skin come off.  It's not as heavy duty as the baby feet, but it does  good job and doesn't leave you with peeling skin for ages. Cheese grater style foot rasps are another good option if using a chemical peel on your feet is unappealing. Lastly, using a foot cream daily with 30% plus urea especially on that area will help, I like the Flexitol one for cracked heels."

AskTrollX,37mums,ohazltn,5,Thu May 28 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"I had one for a while. Nothing too exciting, works pretty well at keeping the babies away. If it's put in correctly you can't feel it, though I was always pulling it out to look at it and make sure it was still there, then washing it and putting it back. I'm kind of OCD like that.  My husband enjoyed the amusement factor of the occasional game of ring toss as well. The alternative is you can take it out prior to lovin', but it's important to remember to put it back in right away.  As far as safety, it's about as safe as any other hormonal birth control. The usual mild increase in stroke risk still applies, even though it's more localized it's best not to take it if you smoke or have a personal/family history of clot-related conditions like stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis.   In terms of pregnancy prevention it's a little more forgiving since you only change it monthly rather than a pill you must take at the same time every day. In any case efficacy with perfect use is about the same as the pill."

AskTrollX,37mums,ComelyChatoyant,2,Sun May 31 04:25:32 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who's had amazing experiences with the ring, while I had to stop due to really bad side effects.   Pros:  The Nuvaring is easy to insert, you can't feel it, and you only change it once a month! You can have sex while it's in but be aware it does not prevent STDs or STIs. Most people who react badly to other forms of BC are just fine on the ring.  Cons:  (please note that these are from my personal experience) On the ring I experience debilitating morning sickness and would vomit every morning with nausia between 7am and 11am like clockwork. I was also always paranoid that it would be squeezed out when I was taking a BM -.- Also it's quite expensive.  Personally, the ring would have been perfect if not for my personal reaction to it. But this reaction isn't true for the majority of people so give it a shot!"
AskTrollX,37mums,helloily,2,Mon Jun 1 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"I love mine, but my friends haven't had consistent results. It's crazy easy, just deal with it once a month and you're done! You do have to actually remember that one time a month though...   Its miles better than pills for me, I was never getting the full benefit because I was always missing or late on taking pills.  You can't feel it once it's in, except maybe for a few minutes after you insert while it gets to your temperature. I do notice a bit of an 'ah that's better!' when I take it out, but otherwise I never notice it.  Ring hack: I use mine to skip periods. I feel positively ovary-less! You (typically) should leave the ring in for three weeks and have a ringless week after, but I just leave it in for four weeks and switch a new one in the same day. My sister in law and I have had great success, 3+ years each of continuous use skipping periods.  I tried to get my friend to use hers continuously and it just didn't... work. Lots of breakthrough, never evened out. Every six months I'll get some spotting but I just take the ring out for a week, get the period out of my system, and continue like normal.  Anyway, good luck! I love this BC but everyone reacts differently  Edit to add: my ring did magically disappear one time. I started bleeding out of nowhere and decided it was breakthrough, but when I went to change my ring next time nothing was up there... So yeah keep an eye on the sucker.  Only happened once but it was massively confusing. Never found the ring, must've come out during sex. That doesn't usually happen and its never in the way, but in the sake of full disclosure.."

Mood wise I was fine, skipping periods was awesome, and I didn't feel it at all.   With my ex, it never fell out during sex and it was fine, no issues. I really loved it.   Years later, with my husband it kept falling out during sex and it would be this giant hunt for the clear ring (often late at night) in the sheets or on the floor around the bed. Ugh. Annoying. I gave up.  I think it was because my husband is a lot bigger than my ex. So my guess is that it depends on the penis whether or not there will be issues.   Just check after sex to make sure it's still there. Overall, a great bc."

I had to wear adult diapers and change them every hour to deal with the blood flow. I kept being told to leave the ring in, but I eventually said fuck them and removed it. I stopped bleeding 3 days later.  I tried it again when I was sure that cycle was over, but I had to be super careful to remove it the second I started spotting, or it would just kick back up and start gushing again.  Also, cum boogers would get caught on it, so I had to rinse it off all the time."
AskTrollX,37mums,Canicanelle,2,Fri May 29 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"In terms of period management/birth control, for me there was no difference between the pill (Alesse) and the Nuvaring. Still low libido, still ""meh"" mood all the time.   In contrast to the others who have commented, I COULD feel me Nuvaring almost constantly. I would put it in properly, so I couldn't feel it, and then through the day it would shift inside me depending on how I was sitting, if I coughed or sneezed, etc. I frequently had to go to the bathroom to push it back in deeper. To be honest it was the most annoying method of birth control I've ever used, with none of the ""pros"" it was supposed to have. And yes it allowed me to skip a period if I wanted, but when I tried that I had a bit of spotting. When I skipped a period using my Alesse, I never had spotting at all.   I used it for 4 months and then I couldn't stand it anymore and had a copper IUD inserted. I didn't want the hormones anymore but I still wanted to be protected against pregnancy. Best choice I ever made. I have never had children but the insertion wasn't that bad, my periods are a bit heavier than on the pill but it's very manageable.   Clearly everyone has different experiences with the Nuvaring, it might be great for you, but I absolutely hated it, I'm sorry!"

AskTrollX,37j27s,TurquoiseOrange,2,Thu May 28 18:39:55 2015 UTC,"Mine is dense, curly/wavey, and mid length (like long but not very long). I get on well with flipping your head upside down trick for layers. If you have a garden bench you can stand on that so that long hair has room. The idea is that then the piece of hair from the top and front get a bit shorter and it makes quite nice layers.   For a trim I part the hair down the center and pull it over my shoulders, either side of my neck. Then I trim each bunch with a series of little snips. This works well for me, it does make the hair at the back a tad longer but not much and it looks even.   I take off as small an amount as possible and if I'm not happy with the shape after a day or a wash&dry then I try somehting different."

This way I am getting the many soft layers thing but it's slightly different. I think it makes the layers a little less deep and it means the over all length doesn't get shorter (you can trim a quarter inch off that seperately before or after)."

Don't cut in a straight line!! Take about an inch-wide strand of hair at a time and cut upwards  (not across) in short, snippy motions. Then I let down the top layer and cut it slightly shorter. Afterwards I go over it with the thinners.  This probably makes no sense whatsoever so go and watch some videos :) And don't forget, it's only hair. It'll grow back!

New smart watch when he already has one.)  A few days ago he went out with his friends and got drunk spent 60$ just on himself. What gives?! And yet he tells me that the next few weeks he is going to be a cheap boyfriend.   I'm not saying that I need to go out and spend money to be with him and have a good time.

Sounds like you two should just talk about how you each want to spend money. Maybe it'd be best to pay your own way or to take turns treating each other. Or maybe he really does want to pay for everything and is bad at managing his money, which is making you feel like he's prioritizing himself over you.

Once you start balancing things out a bit see if that changes his behavior.  It is about priorities and I can see how a dinner would be harder to justify than a phone because you have the phone afterwards and the food is temporary.   Think about adding in some experiences that don't cost much money like going for hikes or finding little museums to visit.

Once he wasn't broke anymore he was eager to make it up to you and pay for dates again, but now he probably feels you've hit a comfortable enough point in your relationship that he shouldn't be expected to pay for all the dates.   You should offer to pay if it's important to you. But you should also make it clear to him that it's important for you to feel valued in the relationship, and a part of that includes him no longer making excuses that he doesn't have money when really he's just chosen to spend it elsewhere. If he's going to make that choice he should be up front about it. To me it seems like you're both in the wrong on this one but it could easily be fixed if you both own up."

AskTrollX,37hlks,JasmineWindsong,10,Wed May 27 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to poor money management skills. I see this behavior in some of my friends, family, coworkers, etc. They have money in their pocket, and they spend it without a second thought. It's like they can't think ahead a few days to see that they need the money to pay a bill, or get gas for their car, or buy groceries, or whatever. So often have I heard them say they need to live off ramen for a few days until they get paid next, but just a few days before they bought a new iphone or a bunch of makeup or something.   I don't think you're being inconsiderate, but rather I think the real issue is that you just have a different expectation of how to manage money. He's spending irresponsibly and it seems you're starting to pick up on that. So you should ask yourself if he set aside some money to spend on you regularly, would you still be okay with how he spends the rest of his money? Or do you feel he's spending too much in general regardless if he used some of on it you?  Have you talked about budgeting with him? I really like YNAB, but mint is really easy to setup and use for a beginner. I used to have these same issues but once seeing Mint show me how much I was really spending on eating out every month, I started working on it. Ask him how much he think he spends on xyz a month. Then have him sign up for mint and see if his guess is accurate. That might be a way to start getting him thinking of his spending habits. But honestly, if he's unwilling to do any of that, then that's another question you will have to think about."
AskTrollX,37hlks,JasmineWindsong,6,Wed May 27 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"That's true... It would still bother me if he would spend that much money on himself because a lot of the time is on stuff that we both agree that he doesn't need, so I'm thinking it's just because he buys stuff compulsively.   Thanks for the suggestion about budgeting with him! I'll definitely bring it up next time we have a conversation about his spending habits. My brother has actually been talking to me about how he uses Mint and suggesting that I should use it because he has been using it and it's useful."
AskTrollX,37hlks,CharlotteCorday_,4,Wed May 27 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"I hope the budgeting talk goes well! He needs to recognize it as a real problem and then make an effort to correct it. It sounds like he kind of recognizes it already, but something isn't fully registering since he still goes and buys it after the talk.   Have you asked him what made him change his mind about purchasing it? Try to get him to pinpoint why he bought it after he agreed he didn't need it. Something is making him change his mind. Might be good to get him to think about what it was and what he needs to be able to overcome it so that he can stand firm on the decision he doesn't need to buy it"

I, personally, think it's super underrated and never got the attention it deserved; it definitely makes me feel like I can't afford to waste my life every time I watch it.  Also, I ask because I've had a super rough semester at school; my mental health issues have peaked it seems and my physical health is at it's worst, but despite all that I've worked harder than I ever have and I want to keep this going, so, after the semester is over I'm going to have myself a much needed mental health day with inspiring movies to refresh my mind and my motivation :) Any suggestions appreciated, but definite bonus (imaginary) points if it has anything to do with travel, art, writing, acting, or mental health <3"

AskTrollX,37i9d8,mianiam,5,Thu May 28 09:59:06 2015 UTC,"Spark: A Burning Man Story.  I've recently gotten into the burner scene (like, about a year and a half ago), and watching that make me want to make art and contribute to my community and to the people I've come to love.  I heard stories about burners leaving Black Rock City to go to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to help rebuild because ""We can build an entire city in a week, why can't we help rebuild a real one?""  And they did.  They were already carting food, water, and shelter for several thousand people, and they jumped right in and helped the rescue efforts there.  Knowing that, and watching footage of the art installations being built and the burning of the Man makes me want to kick my life into overdrive."

AskTrollX,37i4rs,ayoggbe,12,Wed May 27 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure about acne but I have scars on my legs for probably the same reasons you do. I don't bring it up. Most guys don't care and don't bring it up. Maybe they'll ask and you can say it's from the past and you overcame something. That's what I say. Usually that's sufficient. They don't make you ugly and if someone is rude about it they don't deserve access to your body. I am a firm believer in being as confident as possible even when I don't feel it.  I never apologize for how I look and I never point out the shit I don't like about myself to a person I give the privilege of seeing me. If they wanna point out I don't have a flat stomach or that I have scars on my thighs or that I have some stretch marks in a disrespectful way, fuck em. They don't get to see me naked and they CERTAINLY don't get to have sex with me.   Realize that your insecurities and your fears about your body are your own. Anyone worth their salt shouldn't point them out to you and they (whoever you are with) should make you feel sexy and desired. Even if you don't feel it yourself. Hopefully this helps."
AskTrollX,37i4rs,KaleidoscopeBerries,1 point,Wed May 27 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response!  I guess this is all in my head and I'm making it more of a big deal than it probably is. I've told very few people about my past habits and am very afraid of opening up about them should my date, or anyone ask. He's a very sweet guy and our mutual friend assured me that he is one of the good ones, so I'm not too worried about him being disgusted or something. I'm a bit sensitive because I feel I've marred my body.   Thank you so, so much for your comment. I'm feeling a bit more confident."
AskTrollX,37i4rs,mariekeap,6,Thu May 28 00:15:50 2015 UTC,"For background:  I have a lot of scars and acne, both on my body and face. I absolutely hate my skin and think it looks horrible. I haven't dated anyone in about a year, so I'm nervous about someone new seeing what I believe makes me look pretty gross. My exes were not the nicest about my skin insecurities.  The reason I ask is because I'm going to be going out on a date with a guy I've been talking to for awhile, we're starting out as friends. My scars are from the past and I'm not sure how to address that, if at all, and I'm wondering if other people really care about acne? (I personally don't notice it too much, except on myself.)  Thank you!"
AskTrollX,37i4rs,mariekeap,2,Wed May 27 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"It was really hard at first. For several months I never let my boyfriend see me without at least some makeup on - I would even get up in the morning to at slap on some concealer/foundation before he woke. Over time, I got past it. The stronger our relationship got, the more I've trusted him and been able to just hang out with a naked face regardless of its condition that day.   Now, you might be thinking - oh great, time, well I'm going on a date now so this doesn't help me much. The thing is, the process of becoming able to let my boyfriend see my skin on its worst days helped me realize a lot of things.   1) How you perceive your skin is very likely much worse than he sees it. Years of feeling down about it and yourself in general can often lead to your brain exacerbating the problem when you look in a mirror. In truth, while you see the scars and spots, the rest of the world sees the whole picture. In the end they don't really matter as much as you think they do!  2) You don't owe anyone an explanation or an apology. Perhaps he may politely ask at some point where a scar came from and it's up to you to decide whether that's something you're comfortable discussing. It's unlikely he'd ask on a first date though I think. If he's a good guy he'll be supportive either way you choose to answer!  3) You are not defined by scars or blemishes. Similar to (1) there is so much more to you and your beauty than that. They don't make you ugly, or strange, or somehow lesser. Based on your one comment I suspect self-harm - know that those scars represent merely your past, and how strong you had to be to get through that."
AskTrollX,37i4rs,fryreportingforduty,2,Thu May 28 01:40:44 2015 UTC,"I cried reading your comment, thank you for your kind words. I'm so happy that you're able to go without makeup in front of your boyfriend now! I hope one day I can do the same. :)  You suspected correct. I was trying to skirt around the words--I have days where I feel okay about them because, as you said, it shows I was able to get through tough times, but at the same time I feel ashamed. Amongst the old scars are signs of more recent relapses, helping exacerbate the latter feeling. Only four people know that I self-harmed; two were exes. Both were disgusted and didn't want to hear about it. I get that some people can't handle it, it's tough, but I didn't expect that response. In hindsight, they were immature and too self-involved to care.   I worry a lot and project my feelings of myself onto what I believe are people's perceptions. I'm definitely trying to work through that.  Thank you."

AskTrollX,37k0rp,nonskanse,1 point,Thu May 28 05:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not in that type of job, but generic advice - As a grad student, first go to your career center at school and get an overhaul from them. Then go to friends who have jobs you'd want and get an overhaul from them. Then get an overhaul from anyone who is willing when they don't hire you after an interview ""any tips from my next interview? Anything you would change about my resume?"" and any mentors you have. Get the career center to help you find mentors. Use all the resources at your disposal.  I wish I had. My resume is finally ok for my field but I only went through 3-4 editing rounds for my first couple of jobs and 10 would have been just fine :)"

At first, it is kind of slow (maybe $5 to $10 per day), but as you get more used to it and add some scripts (i.e. TurkMaster and join forums), it becomes pretty easy to make $30 to $40 per day. Definitely check it out. :D"

AskTrollX,37hs09,lunatic_minge,2,Thu May 28 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply! :( I've been working on MTurk since 2012. However, I was a dork and didn't find out about the helpful stuff (i.e. scripts, forums, etc.) until late 2013. So while it's taken a while for me, gaining that ground to be able to make that much shouldn't take very long. I've seen new members start off slow, but by the end of the month, start making money towards the $15 to $20 range. When you first start, there is a sort of probation period where you can only submit X number of HITs (not sure how many they allow you to do now). But I believe that's only for the first week or so. It definitely does take some getting used to, but once you are, it's a great way to make some extra money.  /r/mturk is a great place, and also check out /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor. TurkMaster is a script that will help you A LOT (love love love it), and MTurkForum and MTurk Grind (two separate forums) are good. (MTG is a lot less chaotic/more friendly, in my opinion.)

AskTrollX,37eqdm,dutchesse,16,Wed May 27 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"I use dove, but only because I like the way it smells.   My real suggestion for you is to mix ammonia and liquid dish soap 1 to 1 in a spray bottle. It is the only pre treater I use anymore, and it will get out the yellow stains on your clothes."
AskTrollX,37eqdm,NinjaMom728,33,Wed May 27 05:31:40 2015 UTC,I thought you were going to suggest applying the spray to your underarms before applying deodorant. Glad I read all the way through.

AskTrollX,37eqdm,kmm91,2,Wed May 27 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"And I'm just going to (politely) play devils advocate and say not Old Spice. At least, if you're like me and are sensitive to fragrance/ shave your pits daily. I switched to Old Spice per a suggestion on TrollX and ended up with both sting-y application every time and ended up with crazy pit acne within a couple weeks (something I've NEVER had); I've switched back to Secret and it cleared up in about a week. So... maybe not Old Spice if you're like me."
AskTrollX,37eqdm,JamesTiberiusChirp,6,Thu May 28 00:00:18 2015 UTC,"It's the aluminum in deodorant that stains your clothes. Try avoiding antiperspirants, or switching to a less powerful one? A recent scientific study showed that antiperspirant changes the microbiome of your underarms and actually encourages the stinky bacteria to grow.   I also avoid any deodorant that has oil as an ingredient (hard to do, they're usually the roll-one that don't have oil, but read the ingredients). It's really hard because most ""won't stain!"" Deodorant is talking about the white residue, but what kills my clothes is the oily stain from the rest of the deodorant.  These two things combined, plus the fact that my local drugstore literally doesn't carry any non-antiperspirant, lead me to switch to crystal deodorant. I have only been using it a couple of days, but it seems to work great so far, much to my surprise. Someone below mentioned that the potassium alum in it is still aluminum, so word is out about whether it will cause the yellow stains or not, but I do know that there's no oil in it. And unlike regular aluminum products, it's not absorbed into your blood stream, if you're worried about that."
AskTrollX,37eqdm,nonskanse,6,Wed May 27 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"Anything without aluminum should work. I'm using Tom's apricot, and it smells like that instant oatmeal from when I was a kid. Mmmmm."
AskTrollX,37eqdm,koh522,3,Wed May 27 14:01:07 2015 UTC,"Seconding both of these. The aluminum is there as an anti-perspirant which actually makes you stink more. And it's what makes your clothes yellow.  I use the Tom's wild lavender. So much happy now that I'm using it! Been over two years. Never going back to that Secret ""pH balanced"" shit."

It's a white paste but goes on clear and melts into your skin dryly immediately. As a side bonus it also is made by a nice small company in Portland and is free of cancerous shit. The only part that takes a little getting used to is that you apply it with your fingers.  But it's really not so weird after a day or two."

Rather than just masking or neutralising the smell, it literally stops me sweating.  I use the unscented one, and it doesn't dry my underarms out at all, even with daily shaving. It doesn't flake off or stain, it's just... magic. It's the one product I've used for years and still have 100% satisfaction with. Trolls, buy it if you can!

AskTrollX,37dang,SluttyVanille,25,Tue May 26 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, this isn't cool.  Well, before doing something lovely and relaxing and nice to cheer yourself up, I'd definitely recommend doing something productive, something you've maybe been putting off, or something you need to get done. It depends how hard it is for you personally. It could be as simple as putting some laundry away, or washing the dishes. Or maybe finishing an assignment, or paying some bills.  That way, when you then undertake the lovely personal, indulgent times, you wont have that annoying lingering guilt that you might not deserve it, or you should be doing other things, blah blah, silly brain, be quiet.  Once your productive thing is out of the way, it's time to indulge. And this can vary wildly, and I don't know a whole lot about you, and I don't want to creep your post history to find out :P So using me as an example, I just got some boring uni work done, it's half 9-ish and I've giving myself the rest of the night off. I'm going to pop to the shops for milk and biscuits, take a hot shower, wear a nice nightie, and play GTA5 whilst binging Lost. These are things I can get totally Lost in (hehe).  Lots of folks recommend walks. I hear those are good for you. But not everyone. Depends, I guess.  Blanket forts are highly recommended, so I've heard, and also onesies. Tho' these might not be your things.   You could go through old boxes of paperwork to feel active and productive, have a bit of a nostalgia trip, get the filing out of the way, and also keep your mind occupied and active. Remember, guilt about leisure time happens often and it's sucky but you can't always escape it.  Phone a friend? Text a friend. Text 'happy birthday' to a random friend and watch with joy as confusion ensues. I might go do that in a bit too.   I'd tell you some jokes but I don't know many, so maybe you could research some new jokes. Nothing better than telling them to yourselves in the mirror when you're supposed to be getting ready for work!  I'm running out of ideas now. Wine? Wine! I don't drink, maybe you don't. Non-alcoholic is fine too. Hot chocolate? Hot chocolate with wine mixed in? Is that a thing?  Go through some old CDs and remember how terrible your musical tastes were as a teenager.

The problem with taking the ""do things to cheer myself up, I'll be fine"" approach is that a major depression often removes your ability to enjoy much of anything at all, even something you used to really like.  If you've been battling depression all of your life (I have), then you should really look into medication.  Also, try not to be afraid of therapy (easier said that done, I know). I was on antidepressants for years in the past but only started therapy in the last few weeks (because I didn't have access to meds and I needed help NOW, so I went to a therapist that I could see through my university).  I basically cried at her the whole time for the first few appointments, but she was super accepting about it and about me and everything.  It was uncomfortable at the time, but it felt good afterwards to actually talk about everything and not feel judged.  I can't see her anymore but my psychiatrist wants me to do meds + therapy now that I have insurance again.  So I have to find another therapist and start all over again (ugh) but it'll be good in the long run. I think therapy is valuable, at least for me since I'm pretty much a loner and don't share emotional stuff with my few friends."

AskTrollX,37czyp,cdrchandler,1 point,Wed May 27 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Sure! Three stretches/exercises I was doing for upper back and core strength (all starting from laying with foam roller under spine) were:  1) Start with one weight in each hand with your arms straight up in the air, palms facing in toward each other. Slowly bring both of your arms out at the same time, like your arms are wide open as if you were waiting for a hug from someone, until they are parallel with the floor. Slowly bring your arms back up to the starting position. I started these with 2 sets of 10 and eventually moved up to 3 sets of 10.  2) Start with arms straight up again, palms in. Slowly bring one arm up by your head, while simultaneously bringing the other down by your waist, until both are parallel to the floor (or as close to parallel as you can get them). Slowly bring your arms back up to the starting position, then switch sides, bringing your other arm up by your head and the other down by your waist. Bring your arms back to start. That's one rep. Again, I started doing 2/10 and ended with 3/10.  3) This last one is good if you have pain near your shoulder blades. Start with arms up, palms in. Using your shoulder muscles, extend one arm up toward the ceiling, then relax back to start. Do the same on the other side. This is one rep. Again, 2/10 to 3/10.  As with any exercise, if something hurts, take a break or stop. I am not a medical professional and am not giving medical advice, just relaying my PT routine. Hope this helps!"

It's not the tone of the conversation that's anxiety inducing, it's the subject matter which in and of itself is threatening.  It's not hopeless though, I don't think. I'm a bit of a commitmentphobe, so these are things that have been said to me to coax me into the 'exclusive' boat.  ""At this point, I no longer have the time, energy or desire to pursue other people.""  ""I don't want to suddenly start seeing you every minute of every day, but I'd like to continue what we have now.""  ""I have lots of fun with you, but is this just fun or do you think we have potential somewhere down the line (months/years/for realsies no pressure)?""  ""How should I introduce you at parties? Main squeeze, [boy/girl]friend or just by name?""  I think a month is a little early for this conversation, but if that's where your feelings are, you should follow them. The most important thing is honesty with yourself about how you feel, and then communicating that to your partner. If you can do that you can talk about literally ANYTHING and they won't head for the hills."
AskTrollX,37buu3,CHClClCl,3,Tue May 26 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree that there is no easy way of having this conversation but now that things are physical, I'd like to know where his head's at. Such an awkward topic, no wonder I've been avoiding it."
AskTrollX,37buu3,katiebug88,8,Tue May 26 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't avoid it for too long, because if you're asking ""so what are we?"" six months down the line it'll be a really awkward conversation where one of you guys probably thought you were something and the other isn't on board.  2-3 month range is best imo."
AskTrollX,37buu3,missingmiss,4,Tue May 26 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"agree, wait until you've been seeing each other for 2-3 months  then I think it almost doesn't matter how you bring it up, because if he wants the same thing he will want the same thing and if he doesn't he won't"
AskTrollX,37buu3,PossibleAssHat,3,Tue May 26 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"He's probably been struggling to bring it up/not bring it up for at least a week. You can always do what my boyfriend did and struggle to keep his feelings a secret (to not freak me out) until you're drunk one one and blurt out ""I love you"" as we're going to sleep. Then you get the MUCH MORE awkward conversation of ""I'm not there yet"" and you're trying to talk them down from the edge of breaking it off with you.   Trust me. Just be honest with how you're feeling with yourself and with them and you'll be fine."
AskTrollX,37buu3,hellyeahlsd,6,Tue May 26 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"So, I had gotten done having sex with my SO and I was like ""So, should I not be doing this with other people?"" and he said ""I'm not, and I'd like it if you didn't either.""   That was how we determined that we were exclusive after a few weeks. That was fast. Well, whatever. Was also a long time ago and we're still together. I didn't know how to ask so I figured I'd just be totally fucking weird about it.  Edit: He just confirmed that he thought it was weird, but neither of us could figure out what would have been better apparently. haha."
AskTrollX,37buu3,zlpatnegam,2,Tue May 26 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"This is what happened to me; therefore, the best answer."
AskTrollX,37buu3,votas,6,Wed May 27 09:45:49 2015 UTC,"Idk, like I see how 2-3 months is a good time period to have that conversation in, but I also think that if you are wanting to have it, then you should have it. You shouldn't be with someone who might not be on the same page with you for another month or two months. Like, if he needs time to think about an answer, that's one thing. But you should tell him you're thinking about it when you want to. Not being open about this stuff is how people get their hearts broken."
AskTrollX,37buu3,missingmiss,6,Tue May 26 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the idea presented in here that there's no way to do it that isn't chill and nonthreatening. I think saying some variation ""hey I like you and I'm only interested in just us, how do you feel?"" isn't threatening at all to someone who is interested in more. Maybe it is to someone afraid of commitment but that isn't necessarily the majority and if this guy is one of them then you aren't interested anyway, right? It can be scary but in my eyes you have nothing to lose if you don't want to sleep with someone if it won't go anywhere."
AskTrollX,37buu3,votas,2,Tue May 26 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I was trying to say. If I'm afraid of commitment, there is zero way for us to have this conversation and not freak me out."
AskTrollX,37buu3,missingmiss,3,Tue May 26 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Which is totally fine! But saying ""It's literally impossible to have the conversation while being chill and non-threatening; I think that's a misconception."" felt like a massive generalization even if you were saying 'I think'. You were basing it on your experiences (which isn't inherently a problem) but it isn't the same for everyone, which is why I felt the need to comment and say so just so the OP could hear that there is a whole other side that aren't afraid of conversations like that and don't find them to be threatening things."
AskTrollX,37buu3,PM_ME_FACTS,1 point,Tue May 26 23:02:33 2015 UTC,That makes perfect sense. I guess I was operating out of the assumption that her love interest was afraid of that sort of conversation. Which I guess makes it more important that she considers the option that maybe he's not.

AskTrollX,37a0if,chaliceofjeans,3,Tue May 26 05:23:27 2015 UTC,"I've been getting my underarms waxed for about six months now, and I'm super pleased--not only does it not irritate my skin (like shaving does), but at this point the hair is growing in a lot finer! I was thinking that next time I schedule an appointment maybe I'll do a leg wax, because a) easier, b) longer-lasting. Howwwwever: my leg hair is blonde, and I'm concerned that if I get my legs waxed it'll grow in dark and I will rue the day I made the appointment. Thoughts/advice? Thanks, guys!"
AskTrollX,37a0if,Crimnee,23,Tue May 26 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"Your hair isn't going to change color upon regrowing. If you don't currently shave your legs at all, it is possible that your hair has been bleached by the sun to be a bit lighter - but it's going to grow in the same color regardless of how you remove it. If your hair doesn't normally grow in as such a light blonde and you want it to stay that color, you'll have to not remove it at all (or bleach it, I guess).  There's also the matter that your hair could ""appear"" to be darker upon shaving it, because it's leaving a blunt end. This isn't the case with waxing, as it should be pulling the entire hair out.  I epilate rather than wax, so this may not be the answer you're looking for, but your hair isn't going to get thicker/coarser/darker. It could, however, become thinner. There are a few issues with waxing, like irritation - but if it's working for your underarms, which are significantly more sensitive, it should work fine for your legs. Good luck!"
AskTrollX,37a0if,flyonthwall,10,Tue May 26 02:43:51 2015 UTC,Your hair grows back exactly the same colour matter what you do to it.  The idea that shaving and/or waxing makes it grow back thicker and/or darker is a complete myth.  Dont worry about it

However, possibly because of the thinness, the waxing has never taken off all the hair. I think waxing works best on hair that is slightly thicker or more coarse. Do try the waxing, but check your legs very thoroughly the day after to see if it's the quality you're looking for."
AskTrollX,37a0if,chaliceofjeans,1 point,Tue May 26 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I'm sure it shouldn't work this way - could you have just gotten a bad wax? This happens when I do it myself or go to the cheap places."
AskTrollX,37a0if,Craylee,1 point,Wed May 27 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"It was at least three times. The wax was hot roll on wax. The woman who did it is a cosmetologist. The wax worked perfectly fine on my eyebrows, which are half dark and half light. I know it'd work on my armpit hair and bikini line, but my leg hair and arm hair are much thinner and much lighter than those."
AskTrollX,37a0if,chaliceofjeans,1 point,Wed May 27 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"It would be plausible to have a bad wax 3/3 times, I've had more bad ones than good ones and I wouldn't know what a bad one is if I hadn't accidentally encountered a good one. I have encountered so-called ""qualified beauticians"" who are so bad at waxing that I bruised and bled … but honestly I dunno what a cosmetologist is. I am really curious if it's possible for hair to be too fine for waxing now. Where's a professional when you need one?"
AskTrollX,37a0if,Craylee,2,Wed May 27 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"I have a really hard time grabbing my leg hair with tweezers to pull it out. I wouldn't be super surprised if wax also had problems. It did get a lot of my hair each time, just not 100%, so I stopped bothering. Also, it's kinda hard to even tell I have leg hair in the first place and $50 or however much I paid was just too much.   Also also, with the after was sheen, it was really hard to tell that there was some hair left. I could tell the day after once I'd washed the oil/lotion off. Like, I have seriously hard to see hair. I was trying to take a picture of it (granted, with a crappy cell camera) but I couldn't really capture it properly.  I would totally love to hear from a professional, though."

It isn't flat on my back or full on my side, but halfway (the Parietal region between Occipital and Temporal). When the left side of my head has pressure I have nightmares. When the right side of my head has pressure I have silly goofy dreams.   This makes me wonder if this is the true origin of right being ""dexterous"" and left being ""sinister"" of roman languages."

AskTrollX,3776u9,gm2014,22,Mon May 25 13:07:09 2015 UTC,"Wiping away years of social conditioning telling me to be ""nice"" to people helped. Being nice has gotten me into quite a few scary situations, which my temper has then gotten me out of. Also, gaining more confidence in myself as I got older. Seeing that my worth as a human being is not determined by what people I don't know think of me.  The most important thing is to tell her to always go with her gut feeling. Even if someone seems nice or harmless. If she has an unexplainable bad feeling about them or the situation, get away from them.  I get incredibly angry as a defense mechanism if I get scared, and the unexpected reaction has scared off some creepers. I also try to be aware of my surroundings and I don't trust that other people will rush to my help if something happens. Another thing, if I'm walking alone at night I take the ""resting bitch face"" to another level and try to look borderline aggressive, which has also stopped creepers catcalling me as soon as I lock eyes with them.  (This might not be as handy when she is as young as she is, but it might help when she is older.)  When it comes to attitude: Fake it til you make it. Channel your anger. You don't owe ""being nice"" to anyone, only help people if it is safe for you. And again, ALWAYS go with your gut feeling, even if it's a friend/acquaintance/family member.  Sorrynotsorry if I come off a little bitchy and/or aggressive, but I would much rather have some strange man who tried to talk to me on the street think I'm a bitch than something happening to me because I'm trying to be nice and helpful. I'll save my niceness for people I feel comfortable with.  I know that this might not be easy to try and teach her as young girls are conditioned to be, as you mentioned, ""people pleasers"" and can be vulnerable to the methods used by PUAs and the like, maybe even google it and teach her about some of the tricks she might come across so she can identify them rather than falling for it.  I could seriously write a novel about this stuff so, sorry for the long post. Anyways, I wish you the best of luck OP!"
AskTrollX,3776u9,TypMr,5,Mon May 25 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"You don't sound bitchy & this is what I'm looking for...what works for different people.  I'm a big fan of trusting your gut and have given her parts of the gift of fear to read.   I had an especially creepy neighbor, older than my mother, constantly hitting on me as a teen and I felt powerless because I knew she wouldn't believe me (not a great relationship ever) so I do focus on letting her know I'm willing to listen and confront anyone giving her a hard time.   There's also the wrench in the works of the relationship she has with her father...completely non confrontational because she's afraid he'll remove the last bits of affection from her if she does stand up for herself.  It's not the same, but it reinforces her pleasing personality. I like teaching her about pua methods...think that would be helpful."
AskTrollX,3776u9,TypMr,5,Mon May 25 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"I've only read a little bit in ""The Gift of Fear"", but it looks really good so far and I'll probably buy it for myself.  The fact that you are proactive with this, as well as being willing to listen and support her in case something makes her feel unsafe, is great! Too many women get desensitized to cat calling and creepy behaviour, because no one takes their genuine experience seriously.  ""It was just a joke"" ""He's actually a really nice guy, you should give him a chance"" ""Maybe you are overreacting?"" ""He meant well/didn't mean anything by it"" ""Learn how to take a compliment"" Statements like that conditions us to be grateful for the attention and that we have to be nice and sweet and smile because at least we owe them that. In reality, acknowledging cold approaches in the street only invites them to continue harassing you.  I mentioned it in the last comment, but getting her to trust her own judgment is extremely important. No matter what other people think, personal safety is most important.  Regarding PUA techniques: I've worked in sales for quite a few years and I see some of the same tricks used when trying to pick up women, and I have found it very helpful to identify when someone is trying to manipulate me. When it comes to cold approaches, predators will often go after the younger ones, as they are more easily coerced. When I was in my early 20s, I looked underage and I was approached by quite a few creepers because of that, some I have called the police on because of their actions.  I'm guessing that you have already talked to her about consent and stuff like that, but since she is reaching an age where her peers will have a bit more influence (in my experience, that is), it won't hurt to talk about it again in the future, to counteract any negative influence brought on by her peers. I don't know what your daughters social circle is like, but I know that when I was that age we were easily influenced, especially by those a few years older than us.  In any case, you're doing a great job simply by recognizing the issue and talking to her about it :)"
AskTrollX,3776u9,raziphel,3,Mon May 25 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks again :)  I don't see this as a one and done conversation but ongoing. I'm pretty open with everything & she knows I won't bullshit her. We were on a hike yesterday and I brought it up just to feel her out about what's she's experienced so far. Casual, but direct.   I personally have fought against the idea of any attention is good from how I was raised & that sense of owing them gratitude is something I still fight in my own head.   You are very articulate and have done a good job of voicing the mish-mash in my head. Her turning 13, reflecting on how I didn't know how to deal with it, the more situations she is in without me, and yes, the increased influence of peers has had me thinking a lot about this.   And The Gift of Fear is excellent. I actually give it as a baby shower gift since becoming a mother was what really forced me to stop being so 'nice' since I had this little person completely dependent on me."
AskTrollX,3776u9,InkAndComb,2,Mon May 25 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"Slight tangent here:  Trusting your gut often only comes from experience, and predators look for the inexperienced to exploit that lack of awareness (I'm this case, experience equals suffering). Your gut can get blocked by anxiety and confusion, too.  It's a good measure to have, but it's not infallible.    Learn from the small situations in life, so that you can avoid the bigger dangers."

We're pretty open about things and she said it hasn't started yet but I know it's inevitable and I want to empower her.    She's recently 13, but acts her age rather than trying to be 16 so can be slightly oblivious, starting to look more womanly than girlish and the thing I'm most concerned about is she has a people-pleasing personality.  I don't want to see her get into situations she can't get out of just because she doesn't want to hurt someone's feelings.   So what worked for you?  What made you feel empowered?"

I have a hard time with phrasing this, but I know my mom sat me down after my first convention and told me that it doesn't matter if someone is in a respectable position, or older than me; if something makes me feel 'weird' then I should trust that.

I guess I sort of start out by giving fair warning that ""I'm probably not going to cum"" and then I explain what I do and they're also pretty fascinated haha. Lots of guys have thought it was cool, which it is, but it's also a crutch for me.   Since it's legs crossed I've tried various positions with partners that try to simulate that, but it's just so difficult to focus and usually ends in a ""well at least we tried"" sort of way.   Showing someone how you masturbate is just soooo vulnerable for me. I know that's sort of the point but I have yet to crack the code.   Damn, sorry for the wall of text! I'm on mobile so this is probably awful for you to read haha. How about you? What are your general experiences with the way you get off and other partners?? I'd love to trade stories :D if that's not weird.   Edit: OR you can message me of that's less weird haha"

AskTrollX,375u66,ofquartz,47,Mon May 25 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"My BO smells like pot. I haven't touched pot in >15 years.  Also, I got my first lone grey hair this year. It grows out of the centre of my forehead. I don't mean the middle of the hairline, I mean the spot where the supposed third eye is depicted. So yeah I'm really thrilled with that, if more come in I can glue them together and be a unicorn. :|"
AskTrollX,375u66,PossibleAssHat,15,Mon May 25 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"Once I had a white hair grow from that same spot, and it was very strange because the moment I noticed it, it was already at least 2in long. Like it fucking showed up just like that in a split second.  I plucked it. This was two years ago. Haven't had another.   I was VERY stressed at the time. Is that the case for you? I had another friend find one on her cheek when she was really stressed. Plucked it, it never came back."
AskTrollX,375u66,ofquartz,8,Mon May 25 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yesss when I first found mine it was crazy long too, I was so confused over how the shit I never saw it before!  Alas, mine has come back twice since finding and yanking the original. Though I have been super stressed since late last year (breakup, finances, thesis, travel) so maybe it will go away when things are quiet again! That's pretty interesting that this seems to be a thing, bodies are so weird."
AskTrollX,375u66,PossibleAssHat,6,Mon May 25 04:43:38 2015 UTC,Seems to be a trend with the stress. Huh. I hope things do calm down for you soon!   I was stressed as hell for about a year and I seriously developed what seemed like a permanent eye-twitch. I got so pissed off trying to apply eyeliner and mascara. And then feeling that all the time. I really think it added to it. This was during the same time frame that I found that freaky hair. Eye twitch went away when I calmed down. Never saw that hair again.   Unicorns are pretty sweet though!
AskTrollX,375u66,SuddenlyALampPost,3,Mon May 25 04:55:52 2015 UTC,"About 4 years ago I happened to notice a thin, wispy, almost clear hair on my husband's face. I went to pull it off since we have a white cat and it's pretty common for us to get fur on our face. No big deal, right? Except this one was attached to the side of his nose and was almost 2 inches long. I plucked it, we stared at it, laughed, and kept waiting for it to grow back. But it still has yet to make an appearance. So weird!  The timing of it would put it during his really stressful time at work. Interesting"

AskTrollX,375u66,scomperpotamus,3,Mon May 25 06:26:10 2015 UTC,A unicorn hair! That's so cute. I have a a cute black hairs that grow themselves right out of my chinny chin chin.  They were first spotted in bed by my now husband.  I also have 2 Gray hairs on my part that are growing in.  Straight up.  Not down like normal hairs.  Can't wait until my whole head goes Gray and all my hairs are apparently even more unruly than they currently are.
AskTrollX,375u66,ofquartz,2,Mon May 25 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I get the black chinny chin chin hairs too, they're so thick and satisfying to yank out!  Also I'm sort of hugely envious of your antennae."

AskTrollX,375u66,hobbitstoisengard,4,Mon May 25 05:56:20 2015 UTC,"I dated a guy with nystagmus in college which caused his head to shake. In every class we had together (same program, so it was many) the professor would eventually call him out for ""shaking his head in disagreement"" and he would have to explain that he had a congenital eye condition in front of the whole class. It was not cool."
AskTrollX,375u66,CharlotteCorday_,5,Mon May 25 09:00:38 2015 UTC,I have a friend who is legally blind and has to shake his head sometimes to improve depth perception. People mostly don't realise when they meet him and regularly call him out for shaking his head at them. Fortunately he loves how awkward it makes people when he explains and has a great sense of humour about it.
AskTrollX,375u66,__Shadynasty_,2,Mon May 25 11:49:50 2015 UTC,So why did he never go to the professor out side of class and explain things ahead of time?
AskTrollX,375u66,hobbitstoisengard,3,Mon May 25 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"Good question. I guess I don't really know. 99% of people never said a word about it to him so I guess when someone did it was a surprise. He was kind of weird about it, though. Like he didn't know the name of the condition until I did some research and told him, despite it being very obvious to everyone who interacted with him."
AskTrollX,375u66,__Shadynasty_,1 point,Mon May 25 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, OK. Was just wondering cause it sounds like a totally awkward situation that could have easily been avoided, but if he was shy about it then it would totally make sense :)"

Any touch on sort of sensitive spots, like my neck and the base of my spine feels honestly indistinguishable from rubbing my clit. It's just a giant fog of feeling incredibly good.    I can't even tell exactly where I'm being touched a lot of the time (but my SO also likes to move around a lot and try different things, so that's part of it!)  The flip side of it is that I'm incredibly sensitive all of the time. When I'm not turned on, touch feels either painful or very ticklish (after my surgeries the nurses couldn't dress my wounds because it made my jump so much b/c of the tickling, I had to dress my own under their supervision)  That incredibly sensitivity proooobably doesn't help my unrelated chronic pain condition either. I'm on pills that dull some sensation, but the easy orgasms and unfortunate pain are still there. I've been on some pills that have dulled all sensations to where I imagine 'normal' is, but still was able to orgasm from non vaginal non-clitoral stimulation- possibly from conditioning at that point!"

Even after I cut out all remotely physical contact and only talked about videogames and school it continued to get worse.   For some stupid reason I even after I was held down and choked one night while he laughed and tried to kiss me I was only able to cut off contact for a few weeks. The next time I responded to his texts I was drunk and barely able to stumble home. He let himself in and that was the last thing I remember until I woke up with him inside me. I couldn't move and quickly blacked back out. When I woke up in the morning I wanted to kill myself. That was apparently the wake up call I needed to finally stop responding to his texts. I'm still not okay but I'm better I guess. It's been a little over a year and while my ""friends"" at the time still talk shit about me I haven't seen or spoken to any of them since it happened.

AskTrollX,373qx5,MrsDRoosevelt,64,Sun May 24 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"My own Nice Guy story goes something like this:  Met a guy when I was 22 and in college- he was several years older than me, 28 I think. I had recently broken up with my boyfriend but was not even close to over the relationship, so this guy was sort of a rebound and he was very aware of the fact that I was newly out of a relationship. Anyways, we dated for a few months and I realized he wasn't for me and I ended the relationship. I had a birthday party and invited him to be polite (we had several mutual friends). The next morning I woke up and he was next to me, in the bed, gazing at me. I had gone to bed early and had not invited him into my bedroom, so he had just come in during the party and laid down in my bed without my permission.   He started texting and calling me incessantly, telling me I was a whore, a sexual deviant, I broke his heart, I owed him his tuition money because he failed all of his classes and it was my fault for hurting him emotionally, I was selfish and horrible. He threatened to kill himself if I didn't get back together with him. He wrote a letter to my parents detailing all of our sexual encounters (I mean, real detail, and telling them I was a sex addict and needed professional help). Eventually I got back together with my old boyfriend (who I ended up marrying many years later) so Mr. Nice Guy gets a hold of my boyfriend's family's address and starts trying to contact them as well to tell them their son was dating a whore. He would also text me to tell me when he masturbated and that he was fantasizing about me.  Finally I went to the court house and filed a restraining order.  At this point I am graduated from college and starting my first job, so I had to give HR and security at my new job his picture and a copy of the restraining order so that they could intervene if he ever showed up.   Nice Guys are the worst."

AskTrollX,373qx5,MrsDRoosevelt,6,Mon May 25 02:40:17 2015 UTC,"Fortunately he hasn't contacted me in several years now, but every now and then I still have a nightmare about it, something where he is chasing me etc.   I kept a lot of the things he wrote to me so I could bring it to court (where I live you have to show both the harassment and that you made it clear to the harasser that you asked for it to stop). He said things like he was going to ""teach [me] and [my] mom a lesson"" (I have no idea what my mother ever did to get dragged into it as she was always kind to him) and he literally wrote a letter to my parents that asked them for tuition money since their daughter had caused him to fail his classes. It was just a cycle of threatening me, calling me awful names, and then apologizing and telling me he wanted to be friends, and then threatening me again when I wouldn't comply.   When we were in the middle of breaking-up (meaning I had broken up with him but he couldn't let go) he told me he had dreamt about hurting me and ""reenacted it"" by putting his hands around my throat in a strangle. He also showed up at my house one night and refused to leave, saying if I turned him away he would kill himself. My mom was visiting me at college that weekend so she saw all of it and she had him sleep on the sofa in the living room while she slept in my room with me. The next day she showed him out, it was madness.  It got to the point where I was afraid to be home alone and I would spend the night at my brother's house (who owns some shotguns, and is a rather large and intimidating guy all around so I felt like he could protect me if this guy actually decided to take things further).   After I filed the restraining order and had a state trooper checking up on me (and Mr. Nice Guy was served with his copy of the restraining order) the harassment stopped, but I did get a strange letter saying Mr. Nice Guy planned on contesting the restraining order- but he never did. I guess he realized he didn't have a leg to stand on.   About a year later I got a message on Facebook that said he had been  thinking about forgiveness and that he apologized for what he had done. I didn't reply because I was afraid I would be feeding a fire there. I haven't heard from or seen him since.

A few months into out relationship I had a few friends tell me that he was hard core hitting on mutual friends of ours. Did I believe them? No. Of course not. 15 year olds are idiots.  Around this time he also started to pressure me to have sex with him. I told him I wasn't ready and he basically moped until I got so fed up I gave in. A month or two after that he dumped me because his parents didn't approve. From their perspective I was the slut who had corrupted their perfect son. He told me that we would continue to date in secret. I found out a year later that during our ""secret"" relationship he finally was able to hook-up with those ""friends"" of mine.

He presents himself as a bumbling, goofy, nice guy, but it's only a cover for his extreme passive-aggression, conflict-avoidance, irresponsibility, rage issues, and resentment.  He kept score in our marriage. If he did something that he considered ""nice"", he apparently expected over-the-top reciprocation. He expected extra praise for doing stuff like flushing the toilet or putting his dirty laundry in the hamper instead of leaving it on the floor.  When I said ""Thank-you, sweetie"" or ""I really appreciate it"" when he did things like bring home fast food or take out the trash, he felt slighted.  He nursed every grudge, every perceived slight, until his version of me no longer resembled the real me at all.  He was so desperate to think of himself as a ""nice guy"", even if it meant rewriting reality to fit his self-image.  He eventually started abusing me verbally, financially, and emotionally in order to feed his ego and sense of self-worth. He also started soliciting women online for sexual contact since at least 2006. I suspect he was cheating before that, but I have no solid proof. I didn't find out about his indiscretions until 2013, when I finally gained enough courage to divorce him.  Even through the abuse and infidelity, he tried to maintain his ""nice guy"" façade, at least in front of other people.  His behavior since the divorce has alienated everyone who used to care about him, including his own family.  He still tries to paint himself as an innocent, well-meaning, victimized ""nice guy"", but his actions blatantly contradict that particular self-portrait.

He added me on Facebook and we chatted. We had mutual interests, he seemed sweet, we met up a few times. We kissed one time. He had Aspergers which made him really hard work to deal with and I was about to leave for university, so I wasn't interested.   As soon as I leave, he starts pestering me about not getting with anyone in Freshers' Week, and demands to come visit me. I try and put him off, since I'm not interested, but I never really felt the need to 'break up' with him, since we weren't dating. He keeps it up and comes to visit. When I told him that I'd got with a couple of guys in Freshers', the Nice Guy comes out. He starts alternating between trying to guilt me into going out with him and calling me extremely abusive things. I told him to go home. He showed up back at my flat at about 9pm having deliberately missed the last train home so I would have to find him somewhere to stay. I had to let him sleep on the kitchen floor (no closer to my room and I locked my door). In the morning, went to kick him out, and he tried the guilt thing again, and when it didn't work he tried to hit me. Thankfully he left after that, but it scared me all year that he knew my address and I still worry about running into him when I'm home.

I informed his ex when I finally got my head out of the clouds. I have him blocked on everything and every so often he keeps trying to ""talk"" to me through mutual friends. Saying how he misses me to them etc etc etc in hopes I unblock him so he can stalk me like the other exes. I don't understand why they let him but that's their problem."

AskTrollX,373qx5,CharlotteCorday_,13,Mon May 25 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"I define a ""nice guy"" as a guy who claims he is a nice, kind, stand-up kind of person when in fact he treats you well until you assert any kind of independence from him at which point he becomes abusive and possessive- verbally and/or physically- and then tells you that it is your fault, that you brought it on yourself, because you are such a terrible person. He never holds himself accountable for his own actions and always blames you for his misdeeds because you refuse to  fuck him, date him, bow to his needs etc. etc.  I would guess that red flags include any kind of abusive behavior- stalking, harassing, being manipulative, and of course physical violence."
AskTrollX,373qx5,InkAndComb,8,Mon May 25 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"There is a really good article on what a nice guy is, that many women have appreciated, at Doctor Nerdlove's website.  It sums up my personal definition of ""Nice Guys"" pretty well.  You don't have to be a secret abuser (in my opinion), but usually Nice Guys have ulterior motives (friendwise or otherwise), and often complain about being friendzoned when those who aren't interested reassert their disinterest.  Bonus points if they are giving advice to women on their relationships and become incredibly upset when it isn't taking, going as far as to say they should be dated instead and get angry when they're not."
AskTrollX,373qx5,neenoonee,3,Mon May 25 01:53:18 2015 UTC,The easiest way to spot it is that they think they are entitled to a person's attention and/or body because they are 'nice' to them. They are 'friends' with a girl but actually always have an ulterior motive and will start to whine about it when they don't get their own way.
AskTrollX,373qx5,SratTurtles,3,Mon May 25 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"So this isn't as violent as some people's, but it still hit me in the feels.  I'm a very chipper person, and my first Nice Guy was like my Chippette of hyperness; we talked all the time, we bonded instantly, we started hanging out almost every day.  He was my coworker so it wasn't very hard.  I was dating someone at the time; we were very vocal (the bf and I), and fought often.  It was my first long-term relationship.  Nice Guy was a GREAT resource for dude-info.  I couldn't really get the gentleman's perspective, so he was always there with advice, comfort, and willing to talk it out.  Except one night he seemed especially 'helpful'.  I thought I might need to break up, but decided against it.  He seemed disappointed, and then said ""Honestly, I think we'd be a better match. We talk alot, we hang out, we might as well be dating"" and ended it with a light chuckle.  I was horrified. This was, what I thought, my FIRST GUY BEST FRIEND!  I told him that I have a very stronge sense of loyalty; that just because I vent and work through problems doesn't mean that I want to find another man. Extra emphasis on ""I love him and I'm with him,"".   He told me, again, that we might as well be dating.  I was really upset. ""Except we are NOT dating. You're my FRIEND. Or I THOUGHT you were my friend.""  It was made worse by the fact that I had thought he was interested in someone else this whole time, so I didn't think there was any fear of crossed signals.  That, and everything was clearly platonic, both physically and conversationally.  When I did end up breaking up with my bf in the future and I gave in to repeated requests for a date, he insisted on going to Red Lobster and driving me, both something I was uncomfortable with.  Afterwards, when I said I was ready to go home, he was upset that I didn't want to go back to his place.  He was also upset when I didn't want to kiss, and asked ""why he even bothered to take me out then"".    Because a date isn't about the finisher? It's about enjoying company?  Happy ending! He moved to new york and came back an actual nice guy; said he realized he had an ego issue and was an asshole, and that he was compensating due to past experiences. Said he had no idea how entitled someone could be and the city sort of curb stomped it out of him.  Dude is a really great guy now.  Holy shit was he a Nice Guy though."

AskTrollX,373i1t,Willravel,5,Sun May 24 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday!   Hangover cures tend to vary from person to person. I don't get hung over, but I've lived with people who do for years now and I always cook for them.   First thing's first: have a nice big glass of water before going to bed, next time. Dehydration is one of the things you're feeling. It should help to alleviate at least a little bit of the hangover symptoms.   For breakfast the morning after, I've found a big breakfast is a way to go. My first roommate back in college responded best to homemade bagels with cream cheese, red onion, cucumber, and smoked salmon. That's a decent helping of easily digestible carbs in the bagel which can help supply glucose, plus healthy fats to help you feel full but in a good way. If the consistency or the flavor isn't quite your thing, one of my housemates responded quite well to deli ham and swiss cheese on croissants. An ex gf did really, really well with pork sausage, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit. The idea is that you make something really satisfying and hearty because you need both the wide array of nutrients and you need the distraction of pleasurable flavors and textures.   If you're feeling nauseous and a big breakfast seems like a bit much, there are more gentle options. I may not get hangovers but I do occasionally get sick, and one of my go-to recipes is to make a very basic chicken and/or vegetable stock, something warm and flavorful and incredibly nutritious, plus very friendly on the stomach. This may not be helpful to you now, as it takes hours to make, but you can make stock ahead of time, pour it into cupcake baking sheets, freeze them into pucks, and then save them inside freezer bags or freezer tupperware for when you need them (Alton Brown's idea, iirc). I've got a big bag of chicken stock, a big bag of vegetable stock with tomatoes, a bag of ham stock, and a bag of beef stock in my freezer in case I need it for cooking or feel bleh.   So what should you do? Hydrate, decent-sized delicious breakfast with carbs and farts, rest if you feel tired, exercise if you feel restless, and did I mention hydrate?"

Basically, every time I took a shower I'd scrub my scalp under the water vigorously. I liked it because my hair was much easier to style without product. I don't know how tenable it is with longer hair. I never had problems--it didn't smell, go limp, or stain my pillowcases, like some people worry. My hair started to look greasy if I didn't clean in regularly, just like anyone else's. The worst stage is the first 2 weeks or so while your scalp ""gets used"" to not having shampoo and continues to produce lots of oil.  I no longer do it simply because I started to get some dandruff that would only resolve with anti-dandruff shampoo. Otherwise, I'd still be doing it. I notice my hair is drier, harder to style, and fluffier, now. I wish I could still do no-shampoo, to be honest."

AskTrollX,373n6l,TurquoiseOrange,9,Sun May 24 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... lotta hate on this post. Hey ho, apparently yelling about smelling is fun :P  1) Shampooing everyday is considered bad for all hair types by most sources I've seen and heard. When you shampoo out all the oils it can encourage more sebun production so your hair ends up greasier anyways - a bit like using harsh acne treatments can make your T-zone even greasier because the skin tries to compensate.   Shampooing 1 - 3 times per week seems to allow most people's hair to maintain a good balance of natural oils.   2) Using no shampoo seems to be linked to the 'no chemicals' fad. I like using home made, simple, and natural cosmetics so I get involved with this area of 'fad' a lot, usually by accident. Some of the ingredients considered too drying for hair and scalp like SLS are apparently not that bad and using a nourishing conditioner afterwards counters their negative effects. If you research these ingredients or ones with other possible risks (like parabens, preservatives, sulphates) or anyhting that your skin doesn't like you can buy a shampoo that doesn't contain these. I like the Urtekram unscented one, I'm not afraid of 'chemicals' per se but my skin likes this brand.   3) For many people if they decide to stop using shampoo after a transition period their hair no longer seems to require it. Once the transition period (1 -3 months, there's a commitment) of oily hair is over most people find their hair is in lovely condition and is producing about the right amount of oil. A small proportion of people who try this find it never works for them, but they want the no shampoo life they use something like bicarb, soap, or vitamin C powder (also used to help neatralise chlorine after swimming by some shampoo users).   Some people have never used shampoo.  I've known loads of kids who never used any shampoo or conditioner until teenage years, some with hippy parents and one with parents from another country where it was common - all their hair was gorgeous! I don't know that living like them would automatically make your hair gorgeous but it worked for them.  4) Some people choose to use conditioner to emulsify excess oil from their hair while coating it with moisture, this works and I've tried it. I've also tried using various hair masks with egg and gelatine and they refresh your hair and wash off excess oil (I usually apply a load of oil to my hair the night before, and wash it off with the mask, trickier with just conditioner if you're actually adding extra oil I recomend a rinse with vinegar).   A lot of the same people avoid silicones in their conditioner, anecdotal reports from my friends support the idea that this leads to shinnier hair in the short term but bad condition later. Doesn't seem to be as bad as heat treating though.  Conclusion: It depends what you are trying to get out of it. 'no shampoo' is an option. Look at your cat, dog, horse, child raised without use of shampoo. Some people have oilier scalps and skin, for these people it is probably not a convenient option. If you want your hair to smell of strawberries or coconut you can condition it without shampoo, as long as you don't use a conditioner that builds up on your hair and scalp (I'm not experienced in this so can't advice you, as stated above I go with ones that don't upset my sensitive skin so a lot of 'natural' brands that don't use silicones and stuff). If you want hair that is less frizzy this may be a way to achieve that. If you want a healthy scalp and your scalp is not particularly oily this may work for you. If you want to be 'natural' for the sake of natural 'no shampoo' is a good way to go, or washing in sea water, but bare in mind that it is totally a fad and having taps and towels is not natural. If you simply want to avoid drying out your hair and scalp you can use a very small amount of a less harsh shampoo (Urtekram and JASON Aloe Vera are good in my opinion) and wash only once or twice a week followed by soaking your hair in conditioner or oil. If your hair is greasey when you wash it less it will probably go through a transition period where your scalp adjusts to produce more appropriate amount of sebum."

Maybe if you just shampoo once a week and use a cleansing conditioner or shampoo alternative the other 2 times you wash? Or visa versa?   The other thing that I have found helps is brushing the oils from your roots out to the rest of your hair before you wash (I have a nice horsehair brush that does a killer job of this).

I had been real down about my body, but after a few weeks and seeing improvements in how many reps of the moves I could do in even just that short time, even though I'd only lost a pound or two, I was feeling so much better about what I saw in the mirror because I knew how strong my body actually was and could be."

AskTrollX,370q7w,kochipoik,5,Sun May 24 22:23:08 2015 UTC,"It depends if you're trying to appreciate your face/body specifically, or other aspects of yourself.  For face/body appreciation, I used to look myself in the mirror every morning and tell myself ""Damn, you are BEAUTIFUL!"" and gave myself time to look at my entire body until I believed myself more than when I started.  If I felt uncomfortable looking at certain areas, I felt less uncomfortable the more I looked at them, as I refused to look away or despise them, as I made the choice to love it as an extension of Who I Am, become familiar with everything as a well-traveled landscape.  For non-physical appreciation, I like to focus on what makes me feel powerful, embodied and like Myself.  The qualities that we could each be proud of are numberless.  Personally, I focus on what I have accomplished that was particularly challenging for me or the difficult choices I have made that have helped me succeed in my goals.  I'll post quotes on walls that validate my values and choices, or write them in dry-erase marker on mirrors so I see them every day.  I love the validation that comes from seeing that I'm constantly growing more into the person I've always wanted to be, or perhaps always was, but was afraid to be, or did not yet know I truly could be.  I love my strength and my ability to conquer that which formerly made me afraid, so I currently have written on my bathroom mirror ""Put on some lipstick and tell them to go fuck themselves"".  Surround yourself with whatever brings out your inner queen.  Queens make their own rules."

I was actually looking at how to start journaling earlier today, and I think it would be a good start to include quotes and uplifting pictures in my future journal :)  From now on my new mantra shall be 'queens make their own rules' !"

AskTrollX,3714xi,thescreamingwind,6,Sat May 23 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"You wake up late to cool air. The shades are open but it's still dark, because there's an overcast with just a bit of wind. After stretching a bit, you head into the kitchen. The fridge is so stocked that you feel almost overwhelmed by possibility. Ham and eggs on croissant? Vegetable omelet? Chicken maple sausages? You have all the time in the world, so it's pumpkin pancakes with a tall mug of black coffee. Sure it takes a good half an hour to make, but it's so worth it.   After your belly is full, you put on your favorite sweater, the big one that's so comfy that you wonder if it's in violation of some statute, along with a pair of well-worn jeans and walking shoes, along with gloves if it's cooler. The trees in the neighborhood have taken on all manner of orange, yellow, red, and brown, and those trees aren't going to watch themselves. Maybe you put on your earbuds and listen to something relaxing but also beautiful, like a set of Mozart's string quartets (I recommend No. 19). You just exist, looking at the incredible colors, smelling that special autumn smell on the cool wind, moving at a relaxed pace. Before you know it, you've had an hour-long walk and don't feel even a bit tired.   You change into something a bit leaner, but with a big coat, and get to your local yoga studio. The walk was relaxing, but yoga is that crazy combination of deeply meditative and physically challenging. Plus, it tones. A few sun salutations later, and maybe you grab lunch with some of the other people in the class.   Now it's time to get down to business: Autumn decorations. You have the somewhat unique opportunity to spend a decent amount of time making your space into a seasonal wonderland. Just to give you a jumping-off point, here's what I do:  Clean. I do the whole place from top to bottom, dusting, washing, sweeping, vacuuming, polishing, and such. You want to make sure you don't have to immediately move decorations again because they're sitting on dust or dirt or something.   Start simple and classic. I put out an autumn-themed runner on the table which has autumn leaf designs on it, and then put out my old iron candleholders with orange candles. I then put out a few baby pumpkins,  gourds, and acorns between the candles in a sort of randomized pattern. I have a warm orange blanket that I drape over the couch. I put out some firewood next to the fireplace (after cleaning it) both because I'm going to use it and because it smells delicious. Up goes the autumn wreath on the front gate, too. Then it's time to hit up the craft store (not Hobby Lobby) for some fake autumn leaves. Did you know they make autumn leaf garland? There might be something wrong with me.   After that, it's just picking the pumpkins from the backyard, both for decoration and for general eating purposes.   After decorating, people are starting to get off school and work, which means you have the time to, after having had a relaxing day already, go out and socialize. Tell stupid jokes with your friends. Flirt with the barista at the cafe. Go see a movie. Go to a concert. Spend some quality time. And you can stay out because you get to sleep in.   Finally, expand your horizons a bit. Find out if there are any classes you can take for fun at a community college, like singing in a choir or archery or photography. Find out if there are book clubs or hiking groups or anything of the sort in your area. There usually are.   Have fun, because by then you certainly will have earned it!"

I highly recommend finding deep-water aerobics classes aimed at little old ladies -- they're typically relaxing while still offering good exercise and fun pool time.   Yoga and pilates and tai chi classes are all inside. Same with crafting courses -- learn how to knit, weave, paint, do pottery, etc.  You can usually find classes all year round if you have a community center that offers them."

AskTrollX,36xzoj,lynng,49,Sat May 23 01:35:26 2015 UTC,If you can't afford to pay for something that isn't a close friend then simply decline and if you find simply being an attendant to the wedding that too. I've never understood why a bridesmaid should pay for anything other than a gift or travel.  Some people might disagree with me but being Scottish it's not a norm to fork out so much for someone elses wedding. Going to a wedding shouldn't be stressful.
AskTrollX,36xzoj,lunatic_minge,21,Sat May 23 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've never understood how this became the norm at all.

AskTrollX,36xzoj,1YearWonder,6,Sat May 23 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. My best friend got married 5 or 6 years ago, and when she asked me to be her bridesmaid, she straight up told me that she would be paying for the dress. The bachelorette was an equal contribution from all the bridesmaids (and the Mother of the Bride), and basically covered a limo rental for the night so we could bar hop without driving or walking in heels. It was an amazing wedding and we all had an absolute blast.   If someone asked me to be a bridesmaid and then started making all kinds of financial demands, I'd feel like a cash-cow and not a close friend. It might be 'the norm' but I think it's totally fucked. In my mind, manners dictate that the one who does the asking pony's up the cash. If I ask you to dinner, I'll pay. If you ask me to a movie, you pay. It's how shit should work. I doubt I would agree to be a bridesmaid for someone who doesn't think that way."

Other cousin wasn't fussy at all, I borrowed a dress (free), did my own makeup (supplies: $40) got my aunt to do my hair (free), and only paid for travel (fuel, $40) so it wasn't terrible.   Best friend's wedding: paid $100 for a dress (not her fault, she said get the cheapest black dress we could find, didn't have to match each other. I got a dress that I could wear again multiple times and have since) got my hair done somewhere different than the rest of the bridesmaids for cheaper ($20) and the bride treated us to make up (free).   As far as your cost does I find it depends on the individual person. But yeah I'm still never doing it again. Pain in the ass regardless, even if it's cheap, no matter HOW much I love the person, or how much fun the day is.

The only thing we required of them was to wear something that complimented our color scheme.    It was lovely.  They both said some really sweet, beautiful things, and there was much rejoicing with absolutely no financial obligation on anyone's part."

They didn't have to wear anything, except for a novelty button that said ""Best Man"" or ""Maid of Honor"" for the two ""main"" witnesses.

One was a weekend away so we paid accommodation on top but that might have been $100 total.   For mine, I paid for the (fabric for the) dresses so the bridesmaids didn't pay. The two weddings I've been a bridesmaid in, I've worn a dress I already own. I know a lot of brides want their bridesmaids to be matching but here I think it's way more common for the bride to pay, or go halves (our groomsmen wore matching suits and we went halves, so they got a new suit/shirt/tie for $100)"

I don't think my bridesmaid (my maid of honor, my one and only) spent more than one, maybe two hundred at most! Since it was just her, she got this hella awesome sundress on sale at Belk for about $35, had a killer pair of heels already, and her cousin the costume designer did some minor alterations for her (free of charge - gotta love family!). She and my two sis-in-laws helped plan a bridal party that my mom insisted on paying for. We went drinking after that. Other than a little bit of driving, that was it. Her hotel stay was even comped! (Again, thanks family!)  I've only been a bridesmaid a few times, and I honestly haven't paid for much besides my dress and some money (like, $50) towards a party of some kind. I splurged for one friend who had a MOH in name because family, but she talked to me about it and I did all the ""duties"" like having a stripper in my apartment (bride was underage so we did a house party) but her mom insisted on paying for him, and the afternoon before the ceremony she called me in a panic because MOH neglected to arrange for flower petals. I took care of that for her - no big deal; took me one phone call and 20 minutes later it was done. Florist was even on the way from my apartment to the church!

You are absolutely not obligated to stand in on someone's WEDDING if you do not feel that way about them. This is not a time to be mute out of a sense of politeness. I wouldn't want someone to feel obligated to be in my wedding party- and if they DO feel you're obligated, then you should question their motives anyway. Either way you're in the right to step out of this with as much grace as possible."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,DodgyBollocks,3,Sat May 23 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"That's exceptionally personal. It depends on your relationship with the bride/groom/couple and your income, as well as local traditions. As I've gotten older and have more means I spend more money on some of my friends, while others I'll still spend $20-$50 pretty much ranked by how much I like them and am willing to go out of my way for them. One friend whom I adore I spent about $400 on last year (including solo hosting a shower) - and I wasn't in the bridal party. I don't do that for many people. That's a significant amount of money, even for someone who is slowly aging out of the label ""young professional."" On the other hand, my dad is from the Midwest and when his friends kids get married he sends a check for ~$500 pretty much by default, whether he goes to the wedding or not. Apparently giving large amounts of cash instead of a gift is a thing where he grew up."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,Calexica,2,Sat May 23 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"If you wouldn't travel for it not being part of the wedding party, you definitely shouldn't be in the wedding party.  That should be for people who want to go more, not be used as an excuse to obligate you."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,ah18255,2,Sat May 23 05:47:21 2015 UTC,Maybe that includes travel to some ridiculous destination wedding?
AskTrollX,36xzoj,Freyjia,2,Sat May 23 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"I'd nope it out of there. People get hung up on the wrong things when it comes to their own weddings, - specifically superficial things. I have seen brides ask for bridesmaids simply because they wanted some. To me, that is not a good enough reason.   I have one friend who was really hurt that she was not asked to be the bridesmaid for her best friend (who was also my friend, but not anymore) because she was 'too tomboy'.  In the end it was this pretty girl the bride barely even knew herself. I met her for the first time at the wedding and it was just odd. So odd. Now it is two decades later, I wonder what it must feel like to have all these pictures of your wedding day with your 'best friend' being someone you barely ever knew and never truly connected with, and certainly haven't even talked to since.  The whole idea behind the bridesmaids is that they are already close and love each other, so they can work with each other over problems including costs, getting creative if need be, etc. If it is too stressful then something is wrong. It is supposed to be a joyful experience. From what you have said she is just setting the terms and just expecting you to handle it.  TLDR: If you feel like a prop in someone's bridal party then you probably are."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,bsmith84,7,Sat May 23 20:08:46 2015 UTC,"Just explain it to her honestly- tell her you are honored that you were asked but didn't realize when you accepted that it would be as expensive as it is turning out to be. Tell her you mean absolutely no offense, but that financially you cannot fulfill your bridesmaid duties and so you have to regretfully withdraw. If she is a reasonable human she will understand and you will know that your friend is kind and reasonable, if she is not reasonable she won't understand and then you will be down one unreasonable person in your life. It's actually kind of a win-win!"
AskTrollX,36xzoj,kochipoik,7,Sat May 23 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm odd.. but in my bridal party I had a friend who I knew was broke, however I really wanted her to be part of the day, so I just paid for her dress (which was like $120). I also paid for a lot of things, like a hairdresser for all of us. If the bride is really your friend, she should understand."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,DodgyBollocks,5,Sat May 23 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get this either. I made sure my dresses didn't cost more than $50. And my view on it is... I know my girls can't pay for a whole lot, but neither can I... So... Pick your own shoes. You can have your makeup/hair/nails done if you CHOOSE. I can't pay, I'm not forcing. It just seems courteous."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,kochipoik,2,Sat May 23 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"My bridesmaids had hand-made dresses - I paid for the fabric, two of the bridesmaids made their own and I made the other one (she can't sew). They wore their own shoes. I did want everyone to have hair and makeup done but I paid for it because I knew 2/3 of them couldn't afford it and HEY WHAT'S ANOTHER $180 ON WHAT I'M ALREADY SPENDING? Heh."
AskTrollX,36xzoj,BlueRainstorm,5,Sat May 23 08:48:29 2015 UTC,"Not the same position really but for my best friends wedding I couldn't afford to drop 90 something bucks on a dress so she helped me pay her back in installments which worked out great. I plan a trip to see her every year so I just planned to move my trip for the wedding. The wedding ended up getting cancelled and moved to the next year but at least I have my dress paid off I guess?  Since its not someone you're close to I say fuck it, you're not obligated to kill yourself trying to go to this wedding. I say just try to explain your situation hopefully she'll be understanding."

AskTrollX,36yu6f,Dinotronica,2,Sat May 23 07:21:14 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow ladies.  I need your helpful thoughts on my new and fancy body acceptance issues.  I've gained some weight (about 10 kilos) in the last year, and although my weight is still healthy and not a health issue at all, I am feeling really bad about my body. I don't feel confident, especially sexually, and feeling bad about my body is also making me feel bad about myself, for being so hard on myself. It's a bit of a bad spiral to be honest, and I'd wondered if any of you have thoughts, ideas, experiences that related to mine and how I can possibly move forward from here.   Compliments don't actually help, but rather make me feel like the honor guest at a ""She gained weight Pity Party"". I need to like myself, not have someone else tell me I'm pretty.  I don't necessarily want to lose weight either, although getting stronger and more fit would be great, although a limited possibility being a single mom with a full time job.   I like eating, I am healthy and I actually think (with the part of my brain that has retained some weird sense of objectivity) that the size I am now, suits me very well.  I hope that I will somehow be able to find the way back to physical self love and acceptance, so that I might regain my groove.   Please halp.  *edited with helpful gifs"
AskTrollX,36yu6f,sweetpea122,5,Sat May 23 07:30:40 2015 UTC,Spend time naked. It sounds weird but it helps. and join us at /r/StrongCurves and do the bodyweight workouts at home
AskTrollX,36yu6f,sweetpea122,2,Sat May 23 12:59:30 2015 UTC,It doesn't sound weird at all. Thank you. I subscribed to Strongcurves as well :)
AskTrollX,36yu6f,Meggywen,2,Sun May 24 08:06:36 2015 UTC,See if your library has a copy of the book or search for it online and the exercises show up as a pdf. then just look up how to do them
AskTrollX,36yu6f,Meggywen,2,Sun May 24 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"So you're happy, comfortable, and feel good at your weight, but you don't feel sexy and confident about your body, if I've got that right. I get the single mom/full time job thing; it's hard to find help to free up extra time to do any body building. Have you tried kegels at all? They're more easy going as far as exercises, quick, and it combines fitness with sexuality which is amazing!  But I want to put that aside for now and talk about sexuality; do you masturbate at all? Buy any lingerie? Any self-pampering in that area? That really helps with building not just confidence, but familiarity, pleasure, and self-assurance. And you don't have to go at your bits until you orgasm; you can just play with yourself in the shower/bath, when you're alone, anytime you're bored or in the mood!"
AskTrollX,36yu6f,sweetpea122,2,Sat May 23 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"That is it excactly. I think this is a good weight for me objectively, but I am struggling to accept the way I look when I'm naked and it's making me very self conscious during sex.   I have been doing kegels, but I've been slacking off. Same with masturbating. I guess it's all related. My body issues are infesting my sexuality even when I'm alone.   I will try to amp up all positive vagina-related acitivities. I'm going to try the ""be naked more"" approach and add some self pampering. Thank you!"
AskTrollX,36yu6f,TurquoiseOrange,3,Sun May 24 08:04:34 2015 UTC,"Hugs I know compliments don't do anything for you, but you do honestly sound like you radiate confidence! Not many people can say they've found a weight they actually feel good and comfortable with, which tells me there's at least one aspect of your body you've become happy and content with. That says so much about your ability to overcome your doubts about your appearance and feeling sexy!  I hope the self-pampering and ""vagina related activities"" help you :D You seem so cool and I just want you to be so happy and a total sex goddess!"
AskTrollX,36yu6f,TurquoiseOrange,2,Sun May 24 14:10:10 2015 UTC,Also nakedness really did help me to accept my body. I mean really
AskTrollX,36yu6f,InkAndComb,2,Sun May 24 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that in many ways you're being sensible about this and trying to accept yourself and build your confidence. Feeling bad for being down on yourself sounds tricky. All I can suggest is that you sit down with that part of your brain and tell it that you don't really feel you are benefitting from the criticism [of the criticism] and everytime one of those thoughts surfaces just take a mental step back and say ""Ah, I see, you're doing it again, and I don't need this thought. It will go away in a minute."" Then if possible counter it with something positive, like imagining yourself as you are now striking a confident pose like a super hero, or just a pretty forest or a cuddle with your family. At first it may be hard or feel silly and they thoughts may persist, but after a few weeks you will probably notice you are stopping them in their tracks a little quicker and having reinforcing them less and less. This type of technique has done me a world of good stopping loads of 'cops in the head' that want to tell me off dead in their tracks, now I have hardly any (it's been about a decade ;P ).  On the body confidence I second spending time naked. Is it particularly about feeling sexually confident? Some things that myself and other body confident friends have used are:    taking selfies, repeatedly, lots (and they can be just for yourself, with silly make up, silly faces, sexy poses, naked, one a day for a week, poses in your favourite clothes) wearing underwear that makes you feel sexy under your everyday clothes (might be good to make sure you've got well fitting underwear especially after babies and weight changes, you might want full on fancy undies or something comfy but in a nice colour or with a subtle lace trim) laying around naked on your own and focussing on how sexy you look, can be done one tiny part at a time and can be very subjective or silly, positives and nice little 'you' specific characteristics that you may become fond of as you do this more and more [I can see time may be a limiting factor for you, but maybe at bath time making sure to consider how sexy you look].  imagine you are yourself from 20 years time sat in a nice cafe having tea, what would older and wiser you say about this?  imagine a you from any time(s) in the past where you felt very insecure, what would you say to her? would you let her know that somehting she is really worried about now won't matter so much in a few years and tell her how great the things that are important to present day you are? get naked or in your undies and flirt with your sexual partner, don't rush or hide, smile bashfully or give them a sultry stare, just try to get used to being comfortable and experiment with how you feel being seen. remind yourself that you are worth far more than your looks, and occasionally (once a week or maybe every few weeks) do something where you don't look glamorous, like go around in your gym clothes or wear a baggy jumper/no makeup/hair ruffled up in a bun. See how you're still you and still cool and still can be a great you? If you have anyone who you trust to see you for more than your appearance dress this way around them and remind yourself that you are still valued even thought you're not dolled up. If you get any odd reactions don't accept them as meaningful, remind yourself you are wonderful, and try again. And again. And again, acknowledging and letting go any thoughts that try to tell you this proves you are not awesome and sexy, prove to yourself that you are.    [edit, one more]   do a form of exercise that builds strength in a particular area and set yourself tiny targets to improve your personal performance, tell yourself how proud you are each time you do a few more seconds or a lift a few more pounds. I like Pilates for toning and I get really proud of my posture as well as improvements in ability.   Best of luck!"
AskTrollX,36yb9v,obscurethestorm,14,Sat May 23 03:30:36 2015 UTC,"So. My fiance of over a year (we have been together for almost four years) has decided to not to go school next semester. He was kicked out of our university last semester for not having the best grades, and went to a community college on line this most recent semester. However, he has decided to take a semester or two off to focus on his career, which is really taking off right now. He feels that he can't do school and also his job (he actually works two jobs - one boring retail job and one job that is what he wants to do for his whole life).   We are going to tell them over dinner tomorrow in a nice (safe) public place. I am freaking the fuck out. My MIL is gonna die. Someone hold me, please. We haven't told my parents either, but my family is way less big on that stuff than he is. No one in my family has graduated from college in generations, even though my dad is an engineer and my mom works in insurance (both successful). His dad is a postman and his mom is a teacher, and she thinks that college is the only way to a good life. She is gonna flip. I am freaking out just having to even BE at dinner. I don't even want to exist past 3pm tomorrow."
AskTrollX,36yb9v,kissedbyfire9,8,Sat May 23 03:34:56 2015 UTC,"you guys could prepare what you want to say in bullet points in advance and also do some role playing, where one of you anticipates their response and you come up with a response to it? It's always good to be over prepared, it helps you stay calm.  The other thing I would do is bring some facts and figures with you. How many people who graduate from university are really getting good jobs? How many of them are unemployed, underemployed, or underpaid and saddled with debt? It's also important to highlight that  your fiance is doing what makes him happy, and it shouldn't matter how he gets to his dream career. As long as he gets there. Further, he can always choose to go to college at a later date if it helps his career. Hope this helps!"
AskTrollX,36yb9v,kissedbyfire9,6,Sat May 23 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"See, I keep trying to think about those things but his mom is the type of person who argues in circles.  Hypothetical   Me: He can always go back to school, MIL.  MIL: But he's not going to school now! He should go to school now and be a responsible adult! I didn't raise him to be this way!  Me: Well you know, SIL dropped out of school last year as well and she is doing fine. And working two jobs is definitely a grown up thing to do.  MIL: But he isn't being a responsible adult! I didn't raise him like this!   To infinity.  His dad, I am not so worried about. His mom is kind of a nutcase. She didn't speak to him for weeks when she found out that we weren't going to church. I can't imagine what this is going to bring out.  And yet, through it all, my fiance seems to think (and I quote) ""If they throw a fit, I will just tell them to fuck off and they will eventually get over it"" is a good strategy."
AskTrollX,36yb9v,kissedbyfire9,8,Sat May 23 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"well you can warn them that you're about to mention something important and if they act in a certain way (like they have in the past), that you two will leave the dinner.

AskTrollX,36yb9v,annarchy8,7,Sat May 23 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"the important thing is that you protect you and your fiance emotionally. Your fiance is doing what he has to for himself and it's his own life. His mother doesn't have much of a choice: she can either accept it and be supportive or face the consequences. Draw boundaries with unacceptable behaviour. So if it takes a turn for the worse, just leave. It's the best thing for everyone."

AskTrollX,36yb9v,your_mom_is_availabl,3,Sat May 23 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"Hm. Okay, please forgive me if I come off as combative here, but there is no argument about this. It's your SO's choice to make and his mother's opinion really doesn't change the circumstances or his feelings about it. What's to debate, discuss, or argue about? If the two of you present it as a fact (this is already decided and done), she can rail against it all she wants, but none of that should touch you. She can be disapproving and disappointed and whatever, but he's a grown adult and this is his decision, not hers. It doesn't impact her life in any way. It may deflate her dreams for her son, but this isn't her dream or her life. It's his life and he has to live it. Part of being a parent is allowing your children to be adults and make their way in life. If she says he's failing her, just stop the conversation. This isn't about her. Moms don't get to make life decisions for their adult children unless the children are somehow incapacitated. And bullying someone into higher education is setting them up to fail.   Also, if you haven't already, visit /r/raisedbynarcissists. Have your SO check out the sidebar, too."
AskTrollX,36yb9v,cdrchandler,1 point,Sat May 23 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe trying to convince her it's the right thing to do is not the way to go? In my opinion the important thing is that your in-laws are informed of the situation, not that they support it. It's a nice bonus but it's not worth stressing over if you highly suspect it's not going to happen anyway.  Explaining once, handling the first rebuttal, and if she's upset go the ""that's how it is"" route and let her deal with it. Your fiance seems to have a reasonable strategy."
AskTrollX,36yb9v,thisismeER,1 point,Sat May 23 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"I try to steer the conversation away from the abstract (""dropping out of school is a Bad Thing To Do"") and towards the concrete -- could you try asking her what bad things she anticipates happening if your fiancee drops out? And then address those points? And then, if she spirals back, just say that you've already been over those points."
AskTrollX,36yb9v,thisismeER,5,Sun May 24 12:09:08 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing to keep in mind, and possibly the best point you can make to his parents, would be that the whole point of your fiance going to school is to get an education to apply towards a job. However, he has already started a career in the field he loves and is planning on staying in, and first-hand experience is worth much more than classroom experience.  I had a friend who went to DigiPen (a computer science/gaming university) and got put on scholastic probation because his grades were slipping. He wasn't able to keep up with his school work because he was busy writing programs for games. He ended up dropping out of university because he already had a career lined up based off his talent and experience regardless of his level of education."
AskTrollX,36y5e1,kissedbyfire9,14,Sat May 23 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"I would say something.

AskTrollX,36y5e1,Oh_ivy,3,Sat May 23 02:41:48 2015 UTC,"I just feel bad since I asked for no contact. I got married in the past 2 years too and I had mutual friends say that she really wanted to say something, but she ended up not (possibly because I had asked her not to so long ago) and that might have been difficult for her to do. I just feel scummy for asking her not to contact me but then bending the rules for when I want to contact her."
AskTrollX,36y5e1,Oh_ivy,2,Sat May 23 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should feel scummy at all. You can make whatever decision you want.

AskTrollX,36y5e1,chucktheupchuck,3,Sat May 23 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"Okay story time: me and this girl were super close BFFs starting in grade 6. A few years ago, I noticed she was being distant but not in a very purposeful way. I just stopped hearing from her as often, stopped getting invites to things. On a few occasions I took her out to dinner, asking her if there was anything I had done that I could apologize for because I felt she seemed distant etc. etc. She always insisted no.   Then a little while later she moved across the country and her long-term BF broke up with her. I knew she was in rough shape so I sent her a postcard with lots of support but also pointing out that we've been friends for so long and done so much together that it would be a shame if we didn't try to figure out what went wrong. She messaged me saying she appreciated the letter, agreed, and wanted to meet up when she came home for 3 weeks over the xmas break so we could talk it over.   Well, she came home. I tried to meet with her multiple times with her canceling every time. I know what it's like not to have a lot of time when you come home after living far away but every time she canceled it would be things like, ""well I stayed out too late last night and I don't want to wake up in time to meet you."" So at a point I gave up.   In the months following, where I had painfully finally accepted that our friendship was done, she kept commenting and liking everything I posted on FB and it just felt like salt in the wound. That she was keeping my hopes up for a friendship but that she had made pretty clear she didn't really care about it at all.   I sent her a message making it clear that I knew she wasn't trying to hurt me but that her actions were hurting me and that in this situation it would be easier for me to move on if she essentially left me alone, because it just hurt me every time she commented on things. She understood and stopped. Fast forward 2 ish years and her grandmother, who has been a major pillar in her family and source of inspiration and support etc. has just passed away. I'm wondering if I should say anything. I feel like she probably doesn't want any drama or anything uncomfortable and that maybe I'm being selfish by wanting to send my condolences. I also don't think I have a right to say anything when I asked for no contact in the first place. Thanks for any advice!"
AskTrollX,36y5e1,katiebug88,4,Sat May 23 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"I have had some similar situations in my past, and this is based on what worked best for me (and also some terrible mistakes I made. Learn from me, please):  Not acknowledging this loss would be extremely rude, and to be honest, from an interpersonal politics sort of viewpoint, your fight with her is pretty small compared to the loss of a grandmother. Also: don't forget that the issue isn't that you have this fight and you need to win, but rather, you need to keep this from giving you a bad reputation in your hometown that keeps you from having healthy relationships with the people of your choice.  So. Send a card to her AND her family, and make sure the topic of the card is about the grandmother and comforting them, not about how much you feel for them or your sympathy. If you had family members who also knew her family, have them sign the card as well (it reduces the personal connection). Do NOT include a personal note or try to steer the converstation towards you in any way. Do not send flowers, go to the wake, or the funeral (unless another family specifically asks you to go).  She might decide she wants to talk to you after that; giving her a chance is up to you - but know that not giving her at least one chance can give her ammo (and a motive) to start drama.   If you do give her a chance, make sure it's a one strike and she's out thing unless she shows some willingness to work on the relationship as well."
AskTrollX,36y5e1,preciousheirloom,2,Sat May 23 03:30:22 2015 UTC,"oh I really don't care about winning or being right or anything, I just wanted to work out what was going on between us. I have 0 hard feelings towards her and would pick up the friendship without hesitation if the possibility ever arose. We both just changed, a lot. And I can't resent that. We also live in a huge city, so it hasn't impacted my other friendships at all.  I think a card is the right way to go, I would never mention us and you're right to emphasize that. Also her mum is sort of (locally) famous and I'm worried that the card would get lost or even not know who it's from (her mum is very scatterbrained and I haven't been consistently in the picture for about 4 years now), and I'm wondering if I should send it to where she lives now instead.   Thanks for the advice!  EDIT: I also get what you mean about not making it about me and I feel I might have made it seem like that's what I did about the letter I sent after the break up. It was sort of along the lines of, ""Hey, I heard about the breakup with so-and-so. I'm so sorry that that happened and I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now. You will always be best and oldest friend, I love you very very much, and if you ever want to talk (no matter what the time) I'm always here for you. No matter what's happened between us.

AskTrollX,36wagu,diggadiggadigga,2,Sat May 23 01:12:52 2015 UTC,What are the biggest do's and don't's upon returning home?
AskTrollX,36wagu,diggadiggadigga,2,Sat May 23 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of approach they use during surgery.  Do you know if they are going to use a posterolateral or anterolateral approach?  If you aren't completely sold on your doctor, I would recommend finding one that uses the anterolateral approach.  It is less common, so if you aren't picking your doctor, you will most likely be getting a posterolateral approach, which is fine, they have similar outcomes (snooping through your post history, you are british.  I'm not sure how much a say you guys have in picking which doctor over there, so you are probably getting a posterolateral approach).  The reason I would recommend anterolateral is because you will have an easier rehab with it.  Hip replacements have their own set of precautions and movements that you cant do while recovering (a couple of months), and the ones with anterolateral don't effect your life that much while the ones with posterolateral will.   Some people with planned replacements will go see a physical therapist before the surgery.  This is to strengthen some of the muscles that you will be relying on a bit more as you are recovering, and to learn/practice the precautions that go along with the surgery.  I would recommend you doing this.  On do's and don'ts.  The reason I am asking what approach they will use, is because the two approaches have opposite movement precautions.  For posterior approach, you cant flex at the hip (so no bending over at the waist), cross your legs, or turn your toes inward.  This means the following: You cant bend down to pick up something that dropped on the floor.  Either get your fiancé to do it for you, or use a reacher.  You will need to use a dressing stick (or reacher), a sock aid (I am not yet convinced that sock aids aren't magic) and a shoe horn to get dressed, as you cant bend down to put on pants, socks, or shoes.   For the anteriolateral approach, the precautions are the opposite: no hyperextension, no end range abduction (stepping too far to the side), etc.  Which basically boils down to ""no doing crazy yoga moves for a bit"".  DO   Pre-procedure: look through your cabinets.  If there is anything on a low shelf/cabinet that you regularly use, move it.  Put it within easy reach (aka where you don't have to bend down to reach it).  Make sure that your floors are free of clutter.  The last thing you want to do while recovering is fall. Follow the advice of your doctors and therapists.  Since I assume you are going home straight from the hospital (you are young, you don't live alone, etc), you will be mostly seeing the physical therapist.  Follow your home program.  It makes a HUGE difference when people actually do the home programs that they are given If you are given a mobility device (walker or cane), use it.  It might not look super cool, but if your therapist wants you to use it, there is likely a legitimate balance concern.   While you obviously shouldn't abuse them, pain meds are important.  If you cant move at all because of pain, you cant do therapy.  And therapy is what is going to make you recover faster.  Don't attempt to not take any pain meds (unless you have a prior issue with drugs, in which case, deep breathing and guided relaxations can help a little with the pain) In the beginning, you will be in pain.  But I promise you that the pain will subside.  The first few days are the worst.  But you HAVE to get out of bed with the therapists.  Lying in bed all day makes you sick and weak.  Even sitting upright in a chair is better for you (you may need to get a special chair that is taller than normal so that you can sit without bending more than 90 degrees).  The very first few days after surgery, it might feel impossible to get out of bed at all.  But you have to do your best (****with supervision/assistance from therapists or nurses) to get out and stay in the chair for at least a few hours.  Muscles atrophy faster than you think, and there will be additional stiffness and pain if you don't move regularly.  It also increases your risk for blood clots if you aren't moving Please don't abuse therapists, doctors, and nurses when they are treating you.  Crankiness is understandable.  We all get that you are in pain and that you aren't going to be cheery and kind and whatnot.  But at the same time, it is not fun to be yelled at, cursed at, or threatened. Use this as an excuse to make your fiancé do the heavy cleaning around the house.  Recovering from surgery doesn't have to be all bad. Remember to still laugh, have fun, and have a life."

AskTrollX,36u6h7,thatcatshat,11,Fri May 22 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"I know, this is such a silly question and I don't know why it's preying on my mind.    they say you have to kiss a lot of frogs before finding 'the one'.  I recently turned 30 and realized that I have had much less serious relationships than my friends have had.  TLDR I had a lot of mental health issues and was also raped - it slowed down my desire to date.    So now I feel like 'oh I have soo many boyfriends to go though before I find the guy I wanna marry and I'm already 30.  I dont want kids so there's no hurry but I feel so anxious and sad about it for some reason.  I feel like it would take me like 2-3-4-5 year of dating someone before knowing if I want to marry them - or is that not how dating works?"
AskTrollX,36u6h7,jayman419,28,Fri May 22 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"That's not really how it works. I mean, you can go through dozens of people and hope you find someone worth your time.  But 14% of couple who met through work ended up married, compared to 11% who met through friends and 1 in 10 who met on holiday. And 23% of people who met someone during a night out said that it only ended in a one-night stand. While those numbers are from the UK, they're pretty general.  Meeting someone on a date and finding them long-term material is pretty rare. But beginning a relationship with someone you already know, who you met in ""less social"" terms, has a higher chance of long term potential.  In other words, you've probably already met ""the one"", and you might be friends with them right now."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,krakdaddy,11,Fri May 22 04:29:10 2015 UTC,"The second man I ever kissed is the man I am now married to. I knew I wanted him from the start. Because I was pretty young and dumb the first time I kissed him, I second-guessed that a bunch, and dated a bunch of other dudes in between kissing him and marrying him. Those other dudes were learning experiences, sure, and I do, to some degree, feel like I am better at relationshipping with my husband because of them, but the most important things I learned out of all the other relationships (and there were like 10 years of random other dudes in between) is that a) I'm not crazy, and b) if I am crazy, pretending to not be isn't going to make me happy.   So no, you don't have to frog it up if you're willing to trust yourself to begin with. But sometimes frogs are good teachers. Either way, ""number of boyfriends"" is a lame criteria to judge yourself on. No real prince would give a crap, and there's no good reason for you to give yourself crap over a number. Quality is much more important than quantity, yo."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,papaver__somniferum,12,Fri May 22 05:42:18 2015 UTC,"You only need to date one person, if they're the right one. Also, for me at least, when I met that right person, we both knew almost immediately that this was forever."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,PigeonNinja,9,Fri May 22 05:55:43 2015 UTC,"Nu-uh, you don't need to date a lot to find the right guy, but you do need to be open to finding him in whatever form he comes (hopefully human).   I had a couple of barely-real relationships until I met my dude. He wasn't what I pictured for myself (for stupid reasons, i.e. he wasn't much taller than me) so I resisted his advances for a long time and we settled into friendship. We were friends (and, yes, ocassional sexytime sleepover buddies) for two years before I admitted that I was in love with him. We moved in together after four months, and I knew his was it for me at around a year. Now we're married (going on 7 years) and times are as awesome and fun as ever.  So sometimes it can be right in front of your face, but you don't get it until you're open to seeing it. Not that I'm saying you're not open, but... what am I trying to say?... I guess that you don't always need to date at all, really. Maybe you'll just find a best friend who you also want to bang for the rest of your life?   At our wedding, the best man pointed out my lack of previous romantic 'success' in his speech, and said ""they say you've gotta kiss a lot of frogs to find your prince, but PigeonNinja didn't kiss any... she didn't even get near the pond"". Worked out just fine for me!"
AskTrollX,36u6h7,kochipoik,5,Fri May 22 07:57:36 2015 UTC,"I met my now-husband when I was 18. I'd had a few boyfriends before meeting him - only one was kind of serious and that was only for 6 months. I'm almost 27 and we've been married for 2 years - if we'd been older when we met I think we would have got married after 2 years of dating.  For a while I worried that I was missing out by not dating more - but at the same time, I wasn't missing out at all. I don't think dating more would have helped our relationship at all!  I think that saying is better at reassuring people during breakups, or people that HAVE dated lots of people - it's not a guide to relationships!"
AskTrollX,36u6h7,candydaze,4,Fri May 22 06:17:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the person. Some people need to date round to convince themselves they've got what they want, some people don't.   I've only ever dated one guy seriously. This is the guy I am going to marry. But that's me - I know other people don't work that way.   As to how dating works - there really aren't any rules, other than 1) making sure the other person knows your expectations and 2) not being an arsehole. Other than that, date how you want! If you want to be exclusive from the first date, you do that, as long as rule 1 is observed. If you'd rather have as many guys on the go as you want, you do that. As long as rule 1 is observed!   Personally, I could only ever cope with going exclusive as soon as we started dating. We were ""official"" within about four days of getting together, because that's what we wanted. But that's not what everyone wants.   TL;DR. Do what you want! (As long as it's not hurting anyone else)"
AskTrollX,36u6h7,raziphel,8,Fri May 22 10:29:00 2015 UTC,"You have to meet people, but not necessarily date them, to find the person you want to marry.  Those are actually separate things."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,CharlotteCorday_,5,Fri May 22 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, because finding the right person is definitely a numbers game that is the same for everyone. /S  But seriously, no. If anything people who have loads of crappy partners get into a cycle of just being with the first person they find rather than someone who is right for them. You don't have to 'date around'; you do have to have a reasonable understanding of what constitutes a healthy relationship so that you can see it when you find it.   Stop worrying about numbers, but also stop worrying about forever. Dating should be about whether or not you are having a positive impact on each others' lives by being together rather than any other motive. And one day hopefully you'll find that you've been with someone for a very long time and things are still awesome, and you'll have found someone to stay with completely by accident."

AskTrollX,36u6h7,2awesome4words,3,Fri May 22 13:29:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, you just do you. :) The guy I'm with is only my second boyfriend but we're planning on getting married and spending the rest of our lives together. You don't have to date a million guys to find the right one.  I was in the same larger friend circle as my boyfriend before we started dating, though we weren't super close friends. The minute we hung out one-on-one and starter to get closer, he asked me out and the rest is history.    Most of the couples I know met each other through various social groups in university, or through work -- maybe you might have more luck if you tried that?  Then you already sort of know the guy so you don't have to spend like five years making sure he's not sketchy or anything before letting yourself be in love with him and getting married. I have one friend who knew her boyfriend from her major in school (they were in the same one) but they only started dating when they ended up working at the same company upon graduation."

AskTrollX,36u6h7,scosgurl,3,Fri May 22 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Serial monogamist here. I've only been in three romantic relationships over the past ten years. Each relationship was important to me in different ways and each one taught me a lot about what I'm looking for and what it means to be a life partner. The third is currently in progress and, although the relationship itself is quite young, I feel like this might be the one that doesn't end. (Sidenote: My first relationship blossomed out of a friendship. The second two I met on dating websites.)  Personally, I don't see the point in dating someone unless I can see a future with that person. I've never been one for dating around. To me, dating someone I know I'm not going to be with in the long term is kind of a waste of my time. Obviously this is going to be different for everybody, but this is my personal way of doing things. Just thought I'd offer my perspective as something for you to take into account."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,avamir,2,Fri May 22 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"30+ year old checking in. The answer is ""it depends on you.""  I don't see that hurrying is necessary. Even at my age, there's no number quota to fill. Unless you're interested in having kids, there's also no countdown. (I knew early on that I wasn't interested in having children, so I personally feel no ticking clock.) However, as far as ""dating around"" goes, I do wish I'd put myself out there a little more when I was younger. Not because of the numbers game (or maybe in part? I don't know.), but because I would have learned earlier how to be in a relationship, both how to compromise and what boundaries were truly important to me, and how to better enforce those boundaries. I've found that those sorts of things can't really be done in isolation.  Personally, I haven't had any magical moments where ""I just knew"" he was right for me. The only time I felt that heady surge of emotion (or whatever you'd like to call it) turned out to be a mistake because he treated me poorly. Didn't matter what my feelings were. This is not to say that moments don't exist, or that you shouldn't trust your emotions, but the relationships I've had (and have) involved work. I think dating earlier in my life would have taught me that at an age where mistakes were easier to recover from."
AskTrollX,36u6h7,nickiwest,2,Fri May 22 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"You aren't behind the game. I'll bet you have all kinds of strengths and freedoms that your coupled friends envy. It's all a matter of where we put our priorities, and everyone is different.  I learned a lot by watching the relationships around me, even while I wasn't dating anyone. By the time I found someone who seemed worth dating, I had a pretty strong set of criteria in place. It kept me from wasting time with people who weren't right for me, and I learned to look past first impressions (and attractive faces) and pay more attention to long-term compatibility.  If a long-term relationship is important to you, it will happen. Just don't force yourself to meet some arbitrary timetable. Keep being awesome, and you'll find someone where you least expect him/her."

Keep in mind that she might not want any support.  If she wants support, make life easier for her once she gets out, whether that means practical or social support.  Stay connected and affirm that she is loved and supported by her peers and community.  In general, get a feel for what her emotional/social pace is right now and try to match it.  If you're close enough, learn what gaps there are in her self-care or support system, and try to work with her to get them filled either by herself or by her larger support system.  If she wants to talk about it, she'll have things to express, so let her guide the discussion.  Listen with empathy and without judgment.  Don't challenge her views and positions, give her a safe space to talk and feel.  However, don't be surprised if she doesn't want to talk about it.  She sounds like she's embarrassed and might wish that everyone could just forget it ever happened, or might feel guilty for distracting from your wedding planning.  You wouldn't expect a failed suicide attempt to be embarrassing, but it is due to the shame linkage and the fact that the depth of your pain is on display for everyone to see.  Just understand that she was in a lot of pain and wanted the pain to stop, and she saw this as the only viable solution at that time.  It's a natural human instinct that arises during distressing situations where we feel we have little control and/or viable positive choices available to us.

After a year I couldn't handle the pain anymore and had it taken out. I'll note that various gynos have told me that there's absolutely no benefit to Skyla vs. Mirena, and that it's mostly just a gimmick/selling point for women who haven't had kids, but the size difference is completely negligible and it'll hurt just as much/little (this really depends on the woman).

I'm on Nexplanon now but I can't report back on it yet since it's only been a month and I've had other serious hormonal issues to contend with that are totally unrelated to it. I'll say that insertion was easy as pie - just felt like a shot. Healing took about 2 weeks but was just some gnarly bruising. I'm really hoping it works out, because Nexplanon is by far the most effective birth control in existence -- more effective than sterilization. Nexplanon works for 3 years.  I've never tried Depo and don't intend to. Out of the 3 options it has the highest amount of hormones and thus the highest risk of side effects.

AskTrollX,36shvg,timory,3,Fri May 22 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I'm so sorry you had such a terrible experience with Mirena. I've heard that IUDs can sometimes make period symptoms worse, which is one of the reasons I've put off looking into new birth control. I hope Nexplanon works out for you!"
AskTrollX,36shvg,timory,1 point,Fri May 22 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"Me too! Hoping all my hormone issues resolve ASAP so I can stop being such a ridiculous depressed/fat/acne-ridden mess all the time :/ Don't think it's Nexplanon's fault, but it might be adding to the hormone stew. Just need to hold on for a few more months and ride out this insanity wave..."
AskTrollX,36shvg,Melusedek,2,Fri May 22 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"I was on Depo for a year and a half, and it sucked. I got crazy cystic acne all over my face and back, and I gained 30 lbs. My new gyno said she hates Depo and would recomment either Skyla or Nexplanon, so I'm wondering what you ladies who have tried both Depo and either Skyla or Nexplanon think about them. Any major differences in terms of side effects?"
AskTrollX,36shvg,Melusedek,3,Thu May 21 19:38:51 2015 UTC,Not exactly what you're looking for but I switched from depo to mirena. I love it. no side affects and i still don't get my period.
AskTrollX,36shvg,Melusedek,2,Thu May 21 20:13:58 2015 UTC,Did you have side effects with Depo? My doc said that she would recommend Skyla over Mirena for me because it's smaller and I haven't had any kids.
AskTrollX,36shvg,Melusedek,3,Thu May 21 20:17:31 2015 UTC,I haven't had kids either and the insertion went fine. And I had no side effects with depo either.

AskTrollX,36shvg,Melusedek,2,Thu May 21 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"Were you considering other birth control options? If so, why did Mirena win over the others? What was the procedure like?"
AskTrollX,36shvg,uraniumfairy,3,Thu May 21 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also looked at the implant. Mirena lasts longer so it's more financially conscious and is easier since I was also in the process of moving to a new country for 5 years (us -> denmark). Mirena lasts my whole time there (planned 5 years). While dk does have better health care, I didn't want to add another thing on the list of things that I had to learn."
AskTrollX,36shvg,uraniumfairy,2,Thu May 21 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Cool, that sounds like a really logical, sound decision. My boyfriend has an appointment to get a vasectomy soon, so the birth control aspect isn't of the utmost priority for me. My doctor said it would help regulate our stop my periods and possibly get rid of some other issues I've been having, so that would be fantastic."
AskTrollX,36shvg,gymlady,2,Thu May 21 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that if OP is in the US, all forms of birth control like this (so, not condoms, but any female birth control options that she's listed) are completely free if she has health insurance, which she is now legally required to have under the ACA, so hopefully finances aren't an issue!"
AskTrollX,36shvg,mikab00,2,Fri May 22 03:06:36 2015 UTC,Actually that's not 100% true. I recently was considering nexplanon and found out my insurance policy was grandfathered therefore I am NOT eligible for free birth control under ACA because of this.

AskTrollX,36shvg,thisismeER,2,Fri May 22 08:24:50 2015 UTC,Also - hormone-wise skyla is mirena. If that helps.   I was never on depo but skyla has worked out well for me.
AskTrollX,36shvg,twoisnotenough,1 point,Fri May 22 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, but I haven't done a side-by-side comparison of the two. Do you know if there are any other differences besides the length of time they are effective and the size?"
AskTrollX,36shvg,thisismeER,2,Fri May 22 00:51:32 2015 UTC,"No. Skyla is even made by the same people as mirena.  Actually my sister and I (both mid-20s, no kids) got mirena and skyla at almost the same time and the only real difference we noticed was that it took her longer to get used to it (some extra cramping and spotting early on)."
AskTrollX,36shvg,studes,1 point,Fri May 22 01:20:24 2015 UTC,Awesome. That's some super interesting information. Thanks !
AskTrollX,36shvg,twoisnotenough,2,Fri May 22 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"Skyla has a slightly lower dose of hormones than Mirena which means the Mirena is more likely to suppress your period completely than skyla. Here is a website comparing types of IUDs. The size difference is really not that much and the Mirena just happens to have been initially marketed toward women who had already had children. I have a Mirena and have not had kids yet. Regarding nexplanon, the most painful part is generally the injection of local anesthesic."

I think shaving cream is messy and a waste of time, and find that a sharp/relatively new razor and shaving toward the end of my shower after the hair has softened keeps everything non-irritated.

There were also companies that set up homes where you can rent a room and they have everything all furnished for you, that's what I did because I was only living in Melbourne for 5 months so buying furniture seemed like a waste of money. I would get a temporary place then check out the northern suburbs of melbs (Fitzroy/Carlton) and the southern suburbs (st kilda area) and decide which one you'd like to be closer to and which one you might work closer to before deciding where you're gonna live. It's easy to get around with public transport, and a lot of people you meet will have cars, but it's way easier to just be closer to the places you wanna go the most often.  can't think of anything else right now"

AskTrollX,36j0ni,JoyfulStingray,7,Tue May 19 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"That sucks! Is it feasible at all for you to get a window unit? Otherwise I survived 3 summers without AC by keeping the shades shut during the day, creating a cross breeze when I could, setting up window and floor fans, sitting as still as possible, and going to free air conditioned places as much as possible. At night I trained the floor fan directly on myself and spritzed my top sheet with water for evaporative cooling. Also drinking lots of cold water. And taking cold showers."
AskTrollX,36j0ni,gymlady,3,Tue May 19 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"They lifted the ban on window units for the time being, but we really don't want to spend +$100 on a window unit unless it was going to be allll summer.  Our apartment turns the AC off during the fall where you might have a warm streak for a week or two so we have already invested in nice fans instead.  The water spritz is a good idea!"
AskTrollX,36j0ni,delawana,5,Tue May 19 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, this is my hour to shine. I haven't had air conditioning in my apartment for two years, so I'm a pro now.   If you can get your hands on a really big fan, like a box fan, do it. It's pretty much amazing. Failing that, a number of little fans will do. So, the first rule of summers without air conditioning: choose when to open your windows. DO NOT OPEN THEM IF THE DAY IS HUMID, EVEN IF IT'S NICE AND COOL. The humidity will creep inside and stay there after the coolness is gone, and then you'll just be stuck with both heat and humidity. Do whatever you can to avoid humidity.  Whenever a day is even slightly cooler than the inside temperature of the apartment and not humid, open the windows and point the fan towards the outside. It's amazing how well that works. Also regarding windows: cover up any sun-facing windows with dark curtains or blankets during the day.  If you're going to be staying in a particular place for the while, it does help to have a fan blowing on you across from some ice. This is easy to achieve if you freeze an empty plastic bottle (and put it on something like a plate or bowl, since it's going to melt). You can also try making your own air conditioner, there are a number of online tutorials that use cheap materials like foam coolers and a cheap fan - they're basically the same idea as the water bottle and fan, but better at forcing air through."

Open all of the windows, unless it's one of those situations where it's cooler to leave them open at night and close them around daybreak.  Leave them open as long as they provide more relief than heat.  Wind is love, wind is life.  It's also the only thing that's going to dry all of that weird naked sweat.  Embrace the gross.  When you can no longer embrace the gross, take a cold shower.  Take some beer or a refreshing beverage in with you.  Is the shower beer/margarita not cutting it?  Get naked or put on a swimsuit, grab a fan and a spray bottle full of water, and spray yourself down like a dying beached dolphin.

Soak your feet in cool water if you can't/don't want to live in your bathtub. Take cool sponge bathes with a washcloth when you start feeling warm and icky.

On nights particularly warm, I opt for a cold dinner - salad, sandwiches, etc so you don't eat hot food while hot.   We don't have central air, but we do have a few window units.

You want good airflow through your house so try to determine which direction any breezes are coming from around your house and work with them.   Use timers and set them to start blowing around 6pm and stopping at 4 am.  This will make an attic fan effect and will pull cool evening and night air from outside through your house until it starts heating back up outside a little before dawn.  This will keep your house cooler from about 10:00 pm until about noon the next day.  I use box fans like normal inside the house all day.  It really does work decent.  It's not going to be as nice as air conditioning if it's really hot but it is better than just box fans.  Look into getting a squirrel cage fan too.  Those fans are the ones that push the air around in central air and heating and they are real air movers."

AskTrollX,36dl63,JeskaLyn,11,Mon May 18 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"I went through this exactly! I had cokebottle specs for my whole life and they were definitely a part of my identity. That being said, LASIK is seriously amazing. Waking up and being able to see, being able to go in the water without having to decide between being blind and risking your contacts falling out, not having to take them off during sexy times or risk falling asleep in your contacts... it's all awesome.  After a few months my eye doctor said I should probably wear computer glasses to reduce eye strain, so I do have a pair of those now. I love them because I don't need them (they're basically just reading glasses with a coating to cut down on blue light glare) and they actually inhibit my ability to see far away, so I legit get to do this to people at work.  I definitely have times when I miss the quirky glasses aspect of my identity, but it's been worth it!   Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!"
AskTrollX,36dl63,leblueballoon,4,Mon May 18 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Oh that is awesome... and reading/computer glasses can be really funky, too, since you don't wear then all the time and it's a lot less expensive to get a whole collection of them to match your outfits.   That is definitely the kind of encouragement I was looking for. My biggest cheerleader in this process has been my mom, but she had always hated wearing glasses, so when she had LASIK she didn't go through any of the identity loss. I haven't really been able to discuss that concern with her since she doesn't understand it. I was hoping to hear from someone who does, but still thinks it was worth it. Thank you!"

AskTrollX,36dl63,CThomasFlood27,9,Mon May 18 17:16:13 2015 UTC,You can always get glasses just for fashion. Even with LASIK there is a good chance you'll still have a minor Rx correction and can use your insurance for that ;)
AskTrollX,36dl63,coffinnail_,4,Mon May 18 15:57:59 2015 UTC,DO IT DO IT DO IT. I wore glasses from 2nd grade until I was 25. It's weird at first. Absolutely weird. But it's the best decision I have EVER made and would do it a million times over.
AskTrollX,36dl63,coffinnail_,3,Mon May 18 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"Think about the pros vs the cons! What was it that made you think about getting lasik in the first place? Are you tired of stumbling to the washroom at night? Do you fear the apocalypse and living in a world where if your glasses break, perhaps you will never see properly again?     I'm scared of getting lasik (I'm a super weiner), but I've thought about it several times... mainly for swimming and wearing sunglasses, but every time I talk myself out of it and just wear contacts some days. If you really want it though, do it!! Like others have said, you can always go back to wearing a light prescription or no prescription if you miss it =)"
AskTrollX,36dl63,coffinnail_,4,Mon May 18 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"I'm quite the list-maker, so I do have a pro/con chart with a longer list of pros handy. Swimming, last minute decisions to sleep over somewhere without worrying about contact solution, not having to wipe my glasses off all the time. I hadn't even thought about the apocalypse one! That is a damn good reason! And I know I could wear glasses for fashion if I wanted to (though I think I'd feel pretty ridiculous doing it).   It's just little things like being afraid that I'm going to miss the way Christmas lights look all blobby without my glasses, or the ability to just take them off if I have a headache, or the one-upmanship of ""oh you think your eyes are bad? Try on my glasses"" and things like that. I haven't met anyone who regretted the procedure - everyone I've spoken to says it's the best thing they've ever done, and I've already had my consultation and have been informed that I'm a good candidate. It's just this weird nagging ""will I still be me?"" question that's keeping me from solidifying my decision."

AskTrollX,36dl63,Crivens1,3,Mon May 18 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"Just get your current glasses fixed up with non-prescription lenses.

Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), the original Birds of Prey run, the current X-Men run started by Brian Woods (all ladies and so good), Ghost, and Pretty Deadly. If you want a web comic, Run Freak Run is really good. It's about a woman working for Queen Isabella during the Spanish Inquisition."

It is about college freshman housemates in the UK so it's a pretty even split between men and women, but the characters are all amazing.

AskTrollX,36d499,Willravel,2,Tue May 19 06:26:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you read Web Comics, but Gunnerkrigg Court by Tom Siddell is focused on two young ladies that go to a boarding school that is way more complicated - and possibly sinister - than at first glance.  Their friendship is one of the most genuine and touching things I've ever read, and the comic itself is fantastic.  The characters are fascinating, strong, badass, and yet remain real.  They're teenage girls, and sometimes do teenage girl things.  But the whole comic combines mechanics and fantasy and I'm not doing it even a little justice.

The story in 3 was way better but there were some pretty fun gameplay aspects added in 4. The Last of Us is done by Naughty Dog, the same company that did Uncharted and all the Jak and Daxter and Crash Bandicoot games (if you had an older Playstation). For pure ridiculousness, I loved Saints Row 3 and 4. Also Infamous 2 and Red Dead Redemption were fun! You can always check out trailers and see what you like.  It really is a shame that Fable isn't on PS3. I also have a 360, but much prefer the playstation."

I played some GTA so the only thing I did was murder people. Didn't do much story line haha. Now Infamous I've played both along with Red Dead (including the DLCs like Undead).  And agreed.

As far as ideas for employment, do you live near any tourist attractions? Museums, natural attractions, water parks, etc. A lot of places like that may have done a bulk of hiring in the early spring, but there are always employees that don't work out for one reason or another.

Library cards are free too (at least where I live they are), and some libraries have movies too. Also, if you get a library card they might offer reduced prices for museums and such in your area.   State parks are usually free, so you can go exploring at one and find yourself a nice rock, bench, or whatever to sit on, read, have some snacks and generally watch nature. Into photography? You can work on getting pictures of different nature-y things and perhaps make yourself a calendar or coffee table book (there are websites for this, prices vary).   You can also pick up a sketchbook and some pencils and start sketching. People, objects, landscapes- whatever you want!  Knitting can be a pretty cheap hobby, especially if you get to a Michael's or wherever when they are having a yarn sale, but acrylic yarn is pretty much always inexpensive. They also sell yarn at some Wal*marts, so you can look there.   You can google ""cheap or free activities near (your city/town)"" and that might have suggestions.   My last suggestion is do some wandering on Pinterest, looking for cheap and easy recipes perhaps even from other cultures. My mom is from the American South, and I was looking for southern recipes for something one day and found chicken and rice. Basically one of the cheapest dishes ever, but with a few tweaks, you could elevate it something AMAZING.   Hope this helps!"

Next, you should watch when other people tend to apologise. This often varies from country to country, so I don't have a summary for you right here.  You're trying to drop a major habit, and it's going to be tough and annoying! Go easy on yourself if you can't do it right away. You can tell someone close to you to help you by 'punishing' you every time you apologise for no good reason. Like a little pinch or telling you to take it back.  Finally, why do you apologise? You need to take some time and find the reason for yourself. Do you feel like you should? Is it because you feel less important than others? Do you have anxiety? No need to answer me - just try and find out your motivation for apologising. That way you will have something to attack that habit from. ""Should i apologise? Is this my issue speaking? In that case: NO!"" Good luck."

Or however you'd like to phrase it.   It takes time to break a habit, but write down your mantra and say it to yourself every day in the morning, and perhaps at other times during the day when you feel the need to say 'I'm sorry' for things that don't really require an apology. (Or maybe things that don't require an apology from you, do you apologize on behalf of other people a lot?)   It also helps to keep in mind that chronically apologizing can make you come off as insincere. There may be times in life where an apology is needed and appropriate, and you will be taken more seriously if it isn't something that you habitually say all of the time.   Good luck OP!"

The past few months were rocky for us, but in the end I understand and respect his reasons and he was incredibly nice and respectful about everything.   We're both in college and will be spending the summer apart, but we are both definitely open to maintaining a good friendship. We know all about each other (all the deep, dark twisty stuff), have a lot of similar interests, and generally have really great conversations. He's definitely someone I want to keep in my life, even if it's not in a romantic way anymore.   The only thing I'm worried about is the fact that we never really had a ""friendship"" phase before we started dating. I knew who he was through mutual friends, but we'd never talked or interacted until he introduced himself and indicated that he was interested in getting to know me better. I guess there was about a month between him asking me out and when we officially started dating, but most of this was spent apart since we had just gone back to our respective homes for winter break.

AskTrollX,36ab4h,TurquoiseOrange,1 point,Sun May 17 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"An interesting idea. I have a lot of good communication skills, some known difficulties (get tongue tied about certain issues but I try anyway!), and of course can always use more effective and open communication practice. I'm fairly good at being explicit, being accountable, and letting myself be vulnerable. I've noticed my SO is particularly good at being open, not making assumptions, saying what he really means, and not putting pressure on me [this is currently requiring me to adjust to getting myself ready to say things, rather than expect to be cajoled]. What specific aspects of communication do you feel people in a long distance relaitonship are pushed to get good at?"
AskTrollX,36ab4h,10GiggleWatts,3,Sun May 17 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"You have to be explicit about what exactly is bothering you, how it needs to be fixed, and what might be causing it. Since it takes away your ability to physically communicate, there's no way to read body language to see ""Oh, she seems upset, it must be related to _____."" Instead, if you're feeling upset you're going to either have to decide that you can figure it out on your own or very clearly discuss what exactly is on your mind.  Additionally, it takes away your daily physical little reminders that you're into them, that you care about them, and that they're on your mind. You can't give them a little kiss or hold their hand or anything to express affection. So you have to get better at communicating how much you care, how they make you feel, and making up for those little expressions of love that you can't do physically for the time being.  Source: Been doing bouts of long distance for the past three years."
AskTrollX,36ab4h,banamana27,9,Sun May 17 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"I've been in a long distance relationship for almost three years. /u/jordiesbeem is right. Communication is absolutely key to staying together. You must learn to communicate with one another, otherwise it is very easy for the relationship to fall apart.   My SO and I established ""10 minutes time"". Every day, we find at least 10 minutes when we can both be on the phone and free ourselves from all other distractions. Some days we don't get to it, and sometimes we shorten it to 5 minutes. It doesn't matter what we talk about; what matters is we devote the time to one another.   If you can make it work (and trust me, it's fucking difficult), your relationship will strengthen because you both have put in the time and energy."
AskTrollX,36ab4h,supbanana,2,Mon May 18 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"What specific aspects of communication have you found yourself getting better at?   10 minute time sounds adorable!   My current relationship involves the most physical distance I've ever had, but we talk everyday by text and IM. (I'm not used to this, but it has just fitted in and feels lovely)"
AskTrollX,36ab4h,banamana27,5,Sun May 17 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person you asked, but I'm also currently in a long distance relationship. The aspects of communication that I've had to get better at are being specific and getting to the root of an issue. The example that comes to mind is early on, shortly after we had moved apart, I was frustrated because I didn't hear from him very often. It got to the point where I was really upset, crying, and accusing him of not making me a priority. It was true, but not helpful. It wasn't until I was able to say why I felt that way (e.g.: he said he didn't have time to skype with me, but found hours of free time to meet with his friends) that we were able to work on solving the concerns together.   Miscommunication is incredibly easy in LDRs and can be hurtful if not addressed."

AskTrollX,36ab4h,mizzlebizzle,3,Mon May 18 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/supbanana.  You learn to be very specific and clear about what you're trying to communicate.  My SO and I are (almost brutally) honest with one another.  We have learned that in order to move forward, sometimes you have to work though and discuss some very difficult issues.  It hurts sometimes to have your flaws pointed out to you by the person you love most, but it also helps you work through them together.    Early on, we discovered that when we're apart for more than 3 weeks, we both start to forget why we love one another.  It's incredibly difficult to hear that your partner is falling out of love with you, but understanding that it was happening helped us find ways to combat it.  We both understand that the distance adds complications to the relationship that are out of our control and all we can do is work hard to combat it."
AskTrollX,36ab4h,DmKrispin,7,Mon May 18 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"12 years long distance and it'll be 14 before we can really stop calling it a LD relationship. I live in the UK and he's in the US. Been engaged since December and it's really put an emphasis on closing the gap. It is not for everyone. Believe me when I say it does get hard at some parts, really frikkin hard.   Weekly skypes, daily emails or at least an hour on IM will help with missing them. We're 8 hours apart so it tends to be I stay up late and have a few hours unbroken chat after he finishes work. Before skype was a major thing it was daily emails and those are nice. It was like instant letter writing. You tend to have more to talk about than simply ""How was your day"". For some reason you have way more to talk about online than in person.   Depending on how often you can see each other the lack of physical contact can suck depending on your personal feelings for it. Sex for me doesn't bother me when I don't get it but simple hugs, or lack of, can get you down. But when you do finally see each other after however long, it's the best feeling ever. You take that lonely crap feelings and they just disappear. Think ""Love Actually"" airport scene happiness.   When you feel down and think you can't do it anymore just think about how much worse you'd feel if you didn't have that relationship. That's when you know you can handle long distance. I've thought a few times that I can't do it anymore, but the thought of not having him is even worse. I wouldn't change it for anything."

We're doing great and I think that first year really helped us appreciate the other person and the time you get to spend together.  Plus I think it really helps build up a foundation of communication.  I'd also suggest going out and doing stuff when you do get a chance to be together rather than just staying in - I always really liked doing that and it helped to curb any awkwardness that might come up from not seeing each other every day.

AskTrollX,368f4d,claustrophobiic,13,Sun May 17 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"Hi! Sorry if it's a pain to read, English is not my first language. Also, I didn't know where else to post because /r/relationships would just tell me to move on and hit the gym. I figured you girls would be more sensitive.  So here's the deal: a few months ago bf and I were in a bad phase: lots of fights due to miscommunication. We tried to fix it, talked about it, and it actually got better! The fights were less frequent, and when they did happen, they didn't leave us as hurt as before. I believed we were on the right track.  So last Thursday we went out to dinner, everything seemed fine. He then drove me home and we said our ""good night, I love you"" before bed. At 1AM I was woken up by my phone, I had received a huge text from him. He basically said things were not fine, it just seemed that way because he's been keeping everything to himself and pretending that nothing is wrong. But now it was all eating him up inside and he couldn't take it anymore.  I was shocked, got really emotional and we had an ugly fight. Today we met up for dinner again to discuss what we're going to do. He said he needs a break: he wants to save our relationship, but the only way he can see it happening is if we parted for a while, so he can see the problems clearly. We're going to meet up every week or so to try and find a middle ground for whatever we find was bothering us. I've also distanced myself from my friends for unrelated reasons, and he says I should keep in touch with them and this can be a good time for that.  Now here's my biggest problem: I always thought these breaks were just a way to slowly end the relationship without actually dealing with the feelings that come with it. But our plan actually seems like it may work. Am I just being overoptimistic? Do you trolls think breaks can really work?  edit TL;DR bf has been keeping everything to himself instead of talking about it. He now can't take it anymore and says that the only way to save the relationship is to go on a break to see thing more clearly and then try to find a middle ground together. I always thought ""breaks"" were a way to slowly end the relationship. I guess I just want to hear successful ""we're on a break"" stories?  Thank you so much for reading that. You girls are all amazing <3"
AskTrollX,368f4d,QualitySalves,26,Sun May 17 04:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert but if either of you're under, say, 30, move on. You can find better. I tried this type of thing in my 20s and it was a waste of time. Better things await. It might not seem like it, but it's true. Maybe even this same guy will be there in the future, but you'll have to move away from the relationship for a few months or years to appreciate each other.  If you're getting into marriage age maturity levels (you have a regular job or even a career underway and you've thought seriously about having kids) you might want to work it out. But if you're at that level you'd be having serious conversations and not midnight texts.   So it depends where you are in life.   Edit to add-I'm age 35, 2 beautiful kids with fantastic husband. I went thru a few of those ""let's take a break""things in my dating days"

AskTrollX,368f4d,QualitySalves,18,Sun May 17 05:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think a good idea would be to set a time limit (which it seems like you already have with ""a month or so""). If things aren't improving, it may be the case that the relationship has run its course. That doesn't mean that either of you were wrong or that you failed; everyone is growing and changing all the time, and it may be that you two are changing at different rates in different directions. Whatever happens, I hope you find happiness. Good luck (:"
AskTrollX,368f4d,AlgebraicRhombus,5,Sun May 17 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"It'll be ok now, it'll be great soon.  Reconnect with your friends and family, get drunk, get hit on, work on a hobby, focus on yourself for a while. That's how you make him rue the day he wanted a fucking break."
AskTrollX,368f4d,TurquoiseOrange,5,Sun May 17 05:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that the type of break matters, particularly the boundaries that are set. Have you agreed to not sleep with other people? A break that involves just getting some space to think about things is reasonable and, in my experience,  will either bring you to the end of the relationship or help you both learn to appreciate the relationship more. But if part of this break involves a desire to go after other people,  unless you're poly, it's a terrible idea.  My last 'break' was at age 21. I'd had a couple of them with the guy, which helped temporarily fix things, but it ended after the last break. It is a bad sign, drfinitely, but it can work out. If these breaks continue to happen though, it usually means it isn't working."
AskTrollX,368f4d,supbanana,5,Sun May 17 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, we agreed to no sleep with other people. We both think that this wouldn't even make sense, it's just not something we want to do.  The idea is to get some space and identify the problems we had. Then we'll sit down, talk and decide together if we can try and solve them or if we should break up. I guess that's for the best, we can think things trough and not make any decisions in the heat of the moment."
AskTrollX,368f4d,TurquoiseOrange,3,Sun May 17 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think this sounds good in many ways. Especially the decided if and how to solve whatever you identify.  Just for a bit of different thinking - Have you thought about looking at it from another perspective? If I were assessing a relationship and whether to continue it right now before I considered any problems, obstacles, or downsides I might consider:   How I want to live my life? and then whether this relationship fits with that. What are my needs (emotional, social, physical, intellectual, space etc.)?  and does this relationship meet some of them in a way that is comfortable for me? and can I get needs that cannot be comfortably met by this relationship met in other ways? What the relationship adds to their and my life. How complatible is the way we like to communicate? (I've been in relationship where things that made me feel safe, for example, made the other feel pressured and it -sucked-)"
AskTrollX,368f4d,to_neverwhere,2,Sun May 17 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, you gave me a lot to think about! I guess I can also use this space to think about what I want in a relationship. Before we try to solve anything we both need to be sure it's worth the time and effort it's going to take."
AskTrollX,368f4d,A_Walled_Garden,9,Mon May 18 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe even this same guy will be there in the future, but you'll have to move away from the relationship for a few months or years to appreciate each other.   This is an anecdotal story, but your advice was really accurate in my great-grandparent's situation. They married as teenagers, had one daughter, and then divorced a couple years later. Great-grandma went on to marry another man, divorced him, and then got back with my great-grandpa and from there they stayed together another 50+ years. Sometimes breaks are useful, but I think your advice is very valid."
AskTrollX,368f4d,raziphel,3,Sun May 17 06:48:42 2015 UTC,"These stories involve essentially ending the relationship, letting go of it, moving on as people, and then choosing to begin the relationship over again later. It involves a lot less expectation.   I had a number of middle aged friends tell me this when I was 'on a break' or some form of 'seperated, not together, not giving up' relationship. I was incredibly invested in the relationship and poured far too much of myself into it, and built my life around it. We became kind of co-dependant to a certain extent and the relationship gave us so much of a good excuse not to move on with a number of things. We tried to have time apart to see things more clearly, but we were not able to see things clearly.   TL;DR You (or just he) may think you will see things more clearly, but you may not be able to see things clearly from the 'break' position, it may take more than that so it may be better to let the relationship go. If you do, remain safe in the knowledge that if it turned out to be 'right' you can get back together some years later, but you cannot be attached to this as a plan, just an insurance against doing the 'wrong' choice."
AskTrollX,368f4d,raziphel,7,Sun May 17 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to echo the sentiment of some lovely trolls below by saying the relationship can work after a break, if you both want it to. Sometimes they're absolutely a delay to the end of the relationship, but other times you really do just need space to figure things out.    My boyfriend (now husband) and I took a couple of breaks during the long-distance phase of our relationship while we both went to University. LDRs put a whole new level of stress and pressure on a couple, and sometimes the fights got so intense we both just needed to be our own people for awhile and for whatever reason at the time, couldn't figure out how to do that together. I also found that the breaks were good for the relationship because they helped us to see that we still wanted to be with the other person. If you take a break and you don't think about them at all, don't miss them, etc. it may be a sign that you really should move on. But during our breaks, after the anger had subsided, I found myself missing him, which helped me figure out how to resolve some of the problems we had.   I almost wonder if breaks tend to be taken by younger couples because they haven't yet developed the relationship skills or coping skills to deal with problems as a unit. Obviously there are exceptions to this, but like I said, sometimes our problems just got so big and we were no longer functioning as a solid, healthy unit. Separating helped that.  Now that we're older, married, and no longer in an LDR, we are a much better team and have figured out how to work together to solve problems. :)    Sorry for the crazy wall of text. Breaks suck, are scary, and take a sledgehammer to the foundation of trust you've built with your partner. Rather than worrying, try and use this time to evaluate how you feel about the relationship. Are there any issues that are unresolved on your side that you can bring up when you and your partner reconvene? Are you happy in your relationship (apart from the breaks, obviously)? Can you figure out how you might be able to work as a team to solve problems in the future (i.e., better communication might help!) rather than having to separate?   Best of luck fellow troll. <3"

These speak so much to me. We were having trouble communicating, and it's not that we weren't trying; it just felt like we're speaking two different languages.  No need to apologize for the wall of text, I'm thankful you took the time to write all of that, it was really helpful! :) I was happy in our relationship, yes.

AskTrollX,367hcz,mlvk,7,Sat May 16 22:24:53 2015 UTC,Im upfront so I would just tell him how I feel
AskTrollX,367hcz,sweetpea122,6,Sun May 17 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's me. What I've done in the past. And so I've stumbled into relationships that haven't lasted. They've been too one sided as I've been the initiator."
AskTrollX,367hcz,Willravel,2,Sun May 17 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Help! I have a tendency to jump head first into relationships and the last time we went from first date to exclusive in two days and that didn't work out well.  I'm talking to this new guy and we had a great first date a couple of days ago. The kind that went from coffee to a midnight walk around town, stopping by a large party and meeting some of his friends (some of them are my acquaintances as well) to walking some more and chatting and him getting me a taxi home at three in the morning on a worknight.  We've been texting since and he added me on FB right after the date and sent a message that he ""had a great time"" and we've chatted casually on FB since with goodnight messages and random updates of our days since.  But he hasn't even mentioned wanting to see me again and I don't want to become too pushy. As I said I pretty much dragged my last bf into a relationship, because I'm used to being agressive and going after what I want and eventually it scared him off.  I already asked this guy on the first date, I'd kinda like him to  make the next move. :)  So, how do I play it cool, but not too cool?"
AskTrollX,367hcz,narwhaldreams,1 point,Sat May 16 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'd just keep chatting for the time being.   It sounds like things are going well, and he initiated chatting. It's only been a couple of days and, speaking as someone who tends to get really busy, sometimes even the stuff we really want to do has to be put off. If it's only been like two or three days, I don't think I'd take that as a sign of disinterest, particularly given that you're communicating.   Now, if a week goes by without him bringing up wanting another date and you're interested, maybe bring it up. If he seems receptive, cool. If he's a little hesitant, that's okay. You're awesome and that's up to him to figure out."
AskTrollX,367hcz,Incomprehensibilitea,1 point,Sun May 17 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd certainly say that you can't necessarily expect him to make the next move. All the signs are good so far, so perhaps try not to worry? He may very well be feeling the same way as you! I have a tendency to get serious fast, too, and I've learnt from this mistake, but every relationship is different and sometimes you just have to roll with it. Don't be scared to suggest going for a casual coffee or such - it won't come off too strong. It can be hard to find the balance between showing interest and seeming overwhelming, but one of you will have to make a move eventually and you will feel more and more disheartened if he doesn't do it. So, just do it!"
AskTrollX,364rf3,CaususLuciferi,3,Sat May 16 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"Important info: I'm on a budget so I'm not looking to change the color from black right now. This isn't me, but I look strikingly similar to this woman but my bangs are a bit longer and I don't wear red lipstick most days unless I'm going out. The bulk of my hair is extremely long, about down to my mid-back and I'd really prefer to keep as much of the length as I can. I straighten it daily but my natural hair texture is wavy. I have a round-ish face and if I were any paler I'd be translucent.   Even if your advice is only something to endure the awkward stage of growing out the bangs/fringe, it'd be much appreciated. They're just covering my brows right now and I've tried parting them in the middle but they don't blend with the rest of my hair due to the bluntness. I've tried that little pomp thing but they're too short to stay in the clip and plus I'm not 100% on the look on me in the first place, and I've tried parting them on the side but it makes me look like an emo teenager and I'm really not a big fan of looking almost ten years younger than I am (I'm almost 25 but seem to often get mistaken for an 18 year old which is not a look I want to emphasize).  Also, I'd try /r/FancyFollicles but it seems more like a show-off sub than an advice sub so I didn't think this post would fit there. I've had the same haircut for about 8 years now and I desperately want a change. I know I'll likely have to just grow out the bangs/fringe but any pics of cute hairstyles I could get or advice on how to make the awkward stage bearable would be so so much appreciated.

I'm a little chubby and I think that kind of haircut would just accentuate my round face too much. Any other suggestions for keeping the length I have? Or at least most of it? I don't think I want to go any shorter than maybe mid/upper back. I appreciate it nonetheless :)"
AskTrollX,3645v4,highshine,14,Fri May 15 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"I use to step around this issue a lot and I was always really unsure of how to bring it up. After a long time I just started being a tad matter of fact about it.  First off, sit and think where you see the relationship going. If this is someone you want to see in the semi-distant future at all, it's definitely going to need to be discussed at least to a degree.   If it's someone you want to pursue things with further, you SHOULD be able to put some trust in them as to their reaction. If it's someone who is going to react badly, then things may not be as secure as they should be. Your mental health issues are something that aren't going to go anywhere, so it they are going to be a source of serious strain, it's going to be a problem.  However like I was saying, since you're thinking about bring it up, hopefully this person is going to be understanding and listen.   Just bring it up casually, something along the lines of 'This is something really important that I feel we need to have out in the open. X and Y are what's going on with me and I just want to make sure you know about it so there is nothing hidden between us.'   Take it from there and just base it off of how they handle it. If they're ready for more in depth discussion, go for it! If not, then at least you have the topic in the open so it can be touched again later on.   Time and time again this has been what's worked best for me at least. Just being upfront and honest. It helps the other person be aware of what's going on with you, and it can help you get a gauge on their reaction to it and if they are going to be able to be supportive (because let's face it, everyone dealing with mental health hurdles needs some sort of support from their partner, even if it's just being there and understanding and not doing anything actively.)"

I don't tell everyone I meet, of course, but I've just found that being open early on takes away any pressure to be ""normal."""

I talked with him about my anxiety issues because sometimes it can hinder me from doing things that wouldn't bother the average person.   It was something I've had to come to terms with and realize that I have to be up front about. I was embarrassed at first. But slowly just opened up and started talking about it with those people I'm close to. It's actually been great for me to do so. People will relate and it starts conversations and creates a really open atmosphere.   After years of dating him, my SO slowly learned about how to deal with it and help me when needed.

You might want her completely anonymous to you both, or you might want to get to know her a bit so that you feel like you and she are friends who have a stronger relationship than her and your husband. As the third, I honestly prefered the second option. She and I talked and joked and he was mostly a shared toy. It was a fun dynamic."
AskTrollX,362lcl,DJ_BiFurious,10,Fri May 15 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely talk between the two of you before hand. Discuss what you think you might be comfortable with and what you think you might not be comfortable with. Kissing, oral, PIV etc. Maybe work in some sexy fantasy talk while while you two are in bed together to find out what might turn you on or off.  I'd have a good talk with your prospective third in a non-sexual setting too. She'll obviously have needs and desires as well It is important that everyone knows what is on and off the table. It will lead to a potentially more enjoyable experience if everyone knows what to expect. Understand that anyone can call a stop at any time if there are uncomfortable feelings.  Are you bi or bicurious and want to be with the other woman as well? If so, I absolutely LOVE the teamwork approach! Talk about all of the sexy things you are going to do together with your SO to help your third have the most mind blowing experience ever! If you're straight, you can definitely get that teamwork approach with the other woman as well - double BJs are pretty fun to give! My favourite threesomes have been when we have all taken turns teaming up on one person. That way no one gets left out!  As was said earlier, finding a third can be difficult. But, I hope you find an awesome woman who respects your boundaries and can have a ridiculously fun time with you and your SO."
AskTrollX,362lcl,dorothy_zbornak_esq,7,Fri May 15 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, to the bicurious question. As previously mentioned, I'm in a committed relationship, so I want to include my SO as well. He gets hard even thinking about me being with a woman, and why not let him have a little fun if I'm going to be exploring new sexual adventures.   I like the ""teaming up on one person at a time"" approach you suggested! That seems like it could be such a great way to explore without having any negative emotions arise. I always get super excited about the idea of having a threesome with my man and another girl, and then I just get nervous thinking he will want her more than me :( .   I know it's because I have been cheated on in the past (by a totally different person), and unfortunately my insecurities from that experience have never fully disappeared. The man that I am with now reciprocates the love and affection I give him, and during these 3.5 years he has never wronged me in any way. I also know that it is unfair for me to carry my baggage from a past experience into a healthy relationship (working on that). That being said, I don't want past experiences to hold me back from trying something new and exciting.  We have found a potential third person, one of my dear friends that we both care about.  We have talked about it very briefly a couple of months ago, and even came a little close one night while drinking wine and cuddling on the couch. Since then, nothing has happened, and our communication hasn't extended to full on planning. I kind of feel weird bringing it up to her again since we haven't talked about having one in months... I'm sure people can and do change their mind on opinions like these! I think I will try to bring it up to her one day soon when her and I are just kickin it and see how she's feelin.  You all have been so helpful and have given me hope to continue on searching for my magical evening!!! Thanks ladies :)"

AskTrollX,362lcl,raziphel,10,Sat May 16 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"My first threesome was with another straight couple. I had my own personal curiosity to try something more than kissing with girls, I was opened to it but not actively looking for.    I happened to meet them by chance. He was the one to approach me in a bar, I was confused because I had seen he wasn't alone, he explained that she's fine with it. She came back form the toilet, we all ended up talking - just overall flirting while getting to know each other. Nothing happened that night.    After, we exchanged contacts, and went for beers months after we met. We weren't sure of what was going to happen. I was super afraid to break this couple dynamics; what if she thinks I'm doing him too much?, and what if i'm too ugly? - I was actually more nervous about being naked with another girl than the other part.    That night we had beers and it was suuuper fun, they had a great vibe, and it was clear that they had talked about that before, and that everyone was in on the date we were having. That made me super confident to know that I wasn't going to mess anything. It was suuuuuuuper fun!! They were really nice, inclusive, and she was not worried about me being with him, we all cuddled after and I left early in the morning, we did meet up one more time after that.     My overall experience is that it might have been easier since I was outside of the relationship and friendship circle. It was very clear that it was casual sex, and they were very much together and that we were having fun together.    If you are already scared that you'll get jealous, I would take it slowly, before going full threesome, why don't you try making out with another girl while with him, or flirting with another guy together.   Mayeb watch some swing porn, or wife swaping depos (I remember to watch this videos on the lifestyle that were really eye opening on how they can make it work).   Mainly reflect: What is your fantasy with a 3way, what are your expectations?       Is not a matter of getting passed the doubts, because this should be somewhat natural (?) - so know that it might not be for you, and it's ok. Because is not so much sharing or opening the relationship, but inviting someone into your bed. Be clear of your intentions, desires and limits. Do not force it, and just overall be open to new experiences."

(I recommend the former).  even with all the preparation, there will still be challenges, during and after.  learn to process and communicate and handle these things as best you can, and forgive people when they make mistakes.    There are books on the subject you can investigate.  The Threesome Handbook by Vicky Vantosh (Misha Collins' wife) is good, as are others.  One key aspect is that you both need to do this.  He might get jealous of the connection you and she have, for example, but generally speaking it's best when everyone is on the same page.  /r/nonmonogamy and /r/polyamory can help."

He may fuck her, but he comes home to you, treats you well, and (presumably) wants to spend his life with you.  A threesome may also bring you closer together. If you're worried about being jealous, set the expectation that he may only finish with/in/on you. His climax belongs to you, not her. I think that's an absolutely valid rule.  Discussion is so important. Leave no conversation unspoken before you choose to do this. ""Will we use a condom? What is off limits? What would we like to try? Will we contact' her again? Will it be someone we know and a random hook up?"

AskTrollX,361jbo,holymadness,2,Fri May 15 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"I left Canada when I was 25 to live in France for two years.  The most important thing to look into is visas. How far ahead of time do you need to apply? What category do you fit into (skilled worker, student, ""cultural exchange,"" etc.)? How long will you be able to stay? Will you be allowed to work? Is there a possibility of extending your stay if you want to remain longer than anticipated?  The next most important thing is to have a backup reserve of money. You're going to need some to get set up. Money for an apartment, money for food, money for transportation, money for toothpaste and toilet paper and medicine and all that crap. I left with about $3,000 in my pocket, which was enough to live on for at least 2 months, giving me plenty of time to find a job.  It was the best experience of my life. Living abroad gave me a fresh perspective on everything, taught me something new every day, and helped me become a more complete person.  The only other thing I urge you take into consideration is your social network when you're abroad. I had a great deal of luck because my girlfriend introduced me to her friends, but most expats don't have that luxury. You have to work hard to make new friends. Some you'll meet at work, but you'll find you gravitate naturally towards other expats. That's just how it is. Be sure to facetime your friends and family back home often, time differences permitting.  Good luck! I highly recommend living abroad to anyone, especially people just getting started in life (very low-risk, high-reward experience)."

It keeps the blood in the penis and since its at the base of the penis it hits the clit. Also, vibration can numb sensitive tissue which might help him last longer. Introduce it as a sex toy. http://www.amazon.com/b?node=1243852011 has some that you might enjoy. Good luck you two, and remember, sometimes sexual compatibilities change. Just do a quick relationship check because sometimes these things happen for a reason or really do have a cause. Go get 'em tiger!"
AskTrollX,35zs16,Nixthatidea,9,Fri May 15 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Basically every time we have sex, which is a couple times a week (I'm already more of an every day kind of person), it's always in the morning and always for two minutes. He kindly gets me off with his fingers beforehand every time (or sometimes will stay inside of me while he finishes me off.) I appreciate that consideration, but we'd both love it more if he could last longer.  Every time he brings it up, I tell him it's okay. I know he already feels bad about it and I don't want to make him feel worse. But we already have issues with sex frequency, and it would be so much more acceptable if we had sex less frequency if it would at least last a little longer.  He refuses to seek help or listen to anything I've read about online about how I might be able to help him. Basically every time I bring it up he just feels inadequate, no matter how supportive and loving I try to be.  At this point he's made it clear that he'd rather deal with it on his own, but sometimes I just feel so frustrated. Any other trolls have this issue? How long did it take him to get over it? (If ever)."
AskTrollX,35zs16,throwaway546879213,11,Thu May 14 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Kind of have this issue as well. We've been together for a few years and our sex life is non-existent for the most part. We've both battled depression and various other issues. We have a great relationship otherwise, but when we do have sex, he either can't last or can't keep it up. It makes me feel like a disgusting failure because he has no problems handling his business when he's watching porn, it's only when he's with me and I feel so ashamed I sometimes can't stand the thought of him touching me for fear of the rejection. I wish I had an answer for you. All I can say is you have to have that uncomfortable talk or it will eat away at your relationship. It's hard and I'm so sorry you're going through this."
AskTrollX,35zs16,Retsejme,4,Thu May 14 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"Just a quick aside, there's a huge difference between selfishly pleasuring yourself to porn and having a sexual experience with someone. Also, he's probably been working his own rod for most of his life, maybe several times a day at his peak. Of course he's better at spanking the monkey than the two of you are at sex. That's just reality, and experience.    I don't really want to say much else, except that it's not you, or his attraction to you, or any of that. It's probably his way of dealing with how society has told him he is allowed to be sexual/enjoy sexual activity."
AskTrollX,35zs16,AtTheEolian,4,Fri May 15 05:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's something that you can totally work on - but he has to be willing to talk about it. It should be something fun and non-shameful that you do together. Look up solutions together online. Start making it a think that he gets off a few hours before (or sooner, depending) and then you two go for it. Sometimes that helps, but being open and honest has to be the first step. There's no secret hack that will help him without the two of you being in on it together..."
AskTrollX,35zs16,hotheadnchickn,4,Fri May 15 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"His lack of willingness to talk about it is a red flag, IMO."

AskTrollX,35zs16,goldbunny,3,Fri May 15 05:56:06 2015 UTC,"You can be ashamed and still try to fix the problem. Just because it's an uncomfortable subject, doesn't mean he can ignore it. If he's not even trying to work with his SO to fix a problem they both face, I would consider it a red flag. I'm going through something like op is and from the very beginning we were very honest and my SO is doing so much better. He only took a small blow, but it was worth it to put things back on track and I respect him for it."
AskTrollX,35zs16,hotheadnchickn,2,Fri May 15 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. The red flag isn't that it's tough to talk about it, but that he won't talk about something that is a real problem. Doesn't bode well.   My last ex lost his sex drive overnight due to a new medication and would not talk about it. We went from this amazing, dirty, fun, frequent, passionate sex life to rare and half-hearted. It was a big deal, and his unwillingness to acknowledge it, or even call his doctor to ask about options was hurtful and really harmed our relationship."
AskTrollX,35zs16,goldbunny,1 point,Fri May 15 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you went through that. It meant a lot to me, that despite having this deeply embarassing problem, my SO worked through it to show me that he cares. I have no doubt it was difficult for him, it makes me appeciate him more."
AskTrollX,35zs16,ImOldGregggggg,4,Fri May 15 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's a really shameful thing for dudes. I've witnessed it a few times, it's a blow to their self esteem. I don't really think many guys are realistically going to look at it as a fun bonding activity. They see it as inadequacy.   It must be a hard thing for OPs boyfriend to deal with, I don't think we should try to write it off as something he should look at in a different light."
AskTrollX,35zs16,AtTheEolian,6,Fri May 15 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"I meant the activities they do to work on it should be non-shameful/non-shaming.

It's the only way to improve it for a lot of men."
AskTrollX,35zs16,TrashAcctFTW,2,Fri May 15 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"I went through this with my college boyfriend. A year into the relationship it just got quicker and quicker... to the point that it did NOT last 2 minutes. He tried condoms that were supposed to make you last longer, but they didn't. They simply made him numb for quite some time after.   It's such a touchy subject because it's his manhood and he's already feeling down about it. My ex said it was because he was so into me that he couldn't help it, but... ??? After a year? I suggested he take care of it himself anytime prior to coming to see me, but that didn't help either.  The truth is, our relationship didn't last much past this. We tried for two months, there were other issues (admittedly, all on my end- I had fallen out of love with him), but like you, I was wanting it more and it was causing a lack of connection in that department.  I'm sorry you're going through this. I feel your pain."

AskTrollX,35zs16,river_trail,3,Fri May 15 09:54:36 2015 UTC,"Have you tried bringing it up when you werent already in the mood/the moment had recently passed? That could help. Us guys never want to talk about it when its on our minds, we're frustrated. The way you bring it up is important too. Try to be nonthreatening but if he avoids it again you need to stand up for yourself and insist this conversation happens. How have you brought up very serious stuff with him before this?

AskTrollX,360n9r,iamnotspider-man,4,Fri May 15 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"Self confidence has been an issue for me for as long as I can remember. Mostly because I used to link my self worth by the amount of relationships I've had. So far I've had none so my self worth was always pretty low. However thanks to great friends, as well as my own will power I've been changing my out look of myself for the better. I've always been told that I'm kind,smart, funny, and cute by others but I've never believed them till now. With my new found confidence I decided to take the plug and give online dating a try again. I'm not looking for a relationship or anything and I'm always upfront about that. However I'm a bit lost on how to display my self confidence when asked to give a description of myself. I want to say I'm a kind, smart, funny, good looking dude but I'm scared that it comes off the wrong way."
AskTrollX,360n9r,Willravel,2,Fri May 15 02:45:55 2015 UTC,"Part of that is outside of your control. Most people either brag or humble-brag in their profiles, but different people interpret that differently. Many moons ago when I tried online dating, I found that the best success, if success is measured by not just getting contacted but quality conversation from those contacts, came from me listing things I think and do instead of using broad terms about myself. Anyone can call themselves honest or loyal or intelligent, but if you cite credible instances in which you've lived these kinds of attributes, it allows the reader to draw those conclusions on their own. If you've got photographic evidence, all the better. Maybe you have a picture volunteering with kids or of you being out in nature or something.   There's a phrase I hear often in things like writing and television and movies: ""show, don't tell"". The audience, and that includes people who are looking at your profile, would much rather discern things about you themselves than be told about them. Not only will it make you seem less egotistical, but they'll feel more interested."

Once a month, I dust, degrease the inside of the windows, vacuum, and clean commonly touched surfaces like the steering wheel, shift knob, hand break, dials and doodads, door handles and such. The inside of my car smells like nothing at all. There are only two things in the car that I've added: one of those bluetooth audio to radio signal devices to allow music and hands-free through the stereo, and a mobile phone holder.   I got all the doodads out of my system with my first car, because I had a nearly terminal case of FCS: first car syndrome. I had a bright-as-the-sun neon blue shift knob that made driving at night a nightmare, all of Mardi Gras hanging off the mirror, type-R seat covers (which added 3 horsepower), all manner of processed foods, I painted part of my dashboard light blue, I had the cheapest aftermarket sound system in the world, and obviously a set of rims from Kragen. It was the coolest car in the world for a 16 year old kid. Until Junior year of college when I had to sell it and I took a ~70% hit on the price I paid for it.   Bless that car, I hope it's found a good home, but from now on the only goofy doodad in my car is me."

I'm waiting for an excuse and the money to get one from them but if you can afford it, she can do custom measurements and will probably alter a design to the length you want. I've convo'd her many times. If I knew about her when  I was getting married, I would've gotten a dress from her!  FrockFrillies is in the same category aesthetically and pricewise. I've never purchased from them so I can't of their customer service.   TechnoDolly is around the $100 mark. They do custom measurements. I am currently waiting on my order from them.   GatsbyLady has gatsby type of dresses. They're also around the $100 price range.  There are a bunch of sun dresses varying in price that you can see. This is a generic search. You can customize by price and color if you want to narrow it down further."

AskTrollX,35vrt3,betsknees,5,Wed May 13 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"I went through a breakup almost 2 years ago that completely changed my life and how I feel about love and relationships. I’ve been happy being single and focusing on other things, but lately I’ve missed the companionship of being in a relationship. I’ve been talking to a guy for about 7 months and he’s interested in dating, but I’m scared. I already turned him down once because I didn’t think I was ready. I’m over my ex and the breakup, but I’m scared of getting close to someone. And I’m scared of having sex with someone new. I worry that I’m always going to be afraid…  This guy is great, but there’s a few things that bug me. He’s overwhelmingly positive. A glass half full kind of guy while I’m the opposite. Like that scene from Parks and Rec where pregnant Ann just wants to complain and Chris is always there with a positive solution. I feel like I sound ridiculous when I complain about that. The other thing is he’s overly complimentary of me and always extoling my virtues, which plain weirds me out. I can take a compliment, but it’s like he refuses to see any flaws. It seems like a red flag. Am I crazy?  Tldr: scared of dating and guy interested in me is putting the pussy on a pedestal."

When I met my now-husband, we had an understanding that there would be no relationship. It started as just sex, which I'm not ashamed to admit at all. But then I realised I liked spending time with him. I wanted to date him and see where things went. We took things slowly, and because we didn't push things along quickly, I feel we developed a really nice relationship.   With him I realised the fear of not having him in my life- what with his gorgeous blue eyes and deadpan sense of humour- overcame my fear of things ending up the way they did with my ex.   Maybe you could try that? Say to your fella that you still have some doubts/fears lingering after your last relationship (you can emphasise that it's not because of anything to do with him though) and you want to take things nice and slowly to see where they go.   At least that's my input."

AskTrollX,35w6f8,goldcanoe,8,Thu May 14 00:45:36 2015 UTC,I find that the way to rock the loose fitting trend is to only do it on top and do skinny jeans on the bottom to give you shape.  I have an hour glass figure too and I try to find ways to emphasize my waist - that's kinda hard right now due to the fashions.  :/   I'm gonna try buying one of the flowy gauzy tank tops that I see everywhere  and belting it with a skinny belt and see what happens.

No discussion of consent, and it's meant to embarrass her- to make her feel small and objectified on camera.   I have been cat called before and it feels like crap - not a positive way to talk about sex.  It's sexist because it contributes to a wider context of this sort of thing.

I hope that there's something more after death, but I don't live my life like there is.  That said, I think there's plenty of meaning to be found in a life without god. So what if there's nothing more? So what if all the assholes never get their comeuppance and the truly good can die without ever getting what they deserve? There's nothing you or anyone can really do about that except live your life like a decent person and try to make as many people happy as possible.  To me that IS the meaning of life, to have as many good experiences as possible, to help as many people as you can, and to try and make others happy. Personal happiness is something that can only be obtained through internal influences since external happiness if fleeting and forever shifting, so all you can try to do is be satisfied with your life and help others do the same.  Goals? Why not try and make a difference for the future. Do something that will make a lasting impression on other people or the environment? Even if it's forgotten that's okay, everything is eventually.  And I'm getting a little lengthy here with my dribble, but just remember that there's spiritualism in science as well. Everything in the universe is made of some form of energy or another, and energy is never lost it only changes. In the end everyone is connected with everything, and even if there's no god or heaven that's beautiful enough for me.  I might have had a drink or two, but I hope some of this made sense..."

Cleaning up the environment by adopting a highway, or hell, I read a post here on the site the other day from some guy in another country who decided to just start picking up trash he saw after driving by a pond every day on his bike. He helped clean up the area, got other people to help out, and by posting the pictures and his efforts online he probably inspired others to do the same.  Volunteer work is also very fulfilling. I worked at a homeless shelter a while back and there are so many people in need that any effort is worthwhile. Even if you aren't doing anything more than adopting a family in need for the holidays and donating gifts that are on their wishlist, that's one family who has a Christmas now because of you.  Not a big fan of people? Help out in animal shelters! I've got family out in Texas who volunteer at shelters by donating their time to not only clean up after the animals but then spend hours playing and loving them. Others foster pets as well, and if you have disposable income you can donate food and things like that as well.  So yeah...tons of things you can do, just find something that makes you happy too :) Life is short and we're all stuck in it together.

I couldn't tell you how many smiles I've shared with strangers, and the warm feeling that follows because of the positive connection I've made! You could also try making people happy on a grander scale, like volunteering, or advocating. This isn't as easy, and you need to make sure that it's something that you're actually interested in. It can be very worthwhile, though. Just make sure that you know your own limits, because your own happiness should not be overshadowed by your goal of making others happy. And also remember that you can find purpose and meaning in your life without involving other people.

If it helps, the loneliness disappears after a while and I found a new way to fit in with the world. Your sense of safety will return. I'm a stronger atheist than I was in my teens."

AskTrollX,35s5bw,nerdyjellyfish,2,Wed May 13 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"TrollYer here. I know the feeling. I went through it too, recently. For me, the acceptance of the fleeting nature of life and lack of a guiding hand of a supreme being made everything more beautiful.  Look what human kind has accomplished. We have been to the moon! We left this planet! Assuming you also believe in evolution, we have grown from simple cells to a crazy complex organism that can venture out to explore the world and stars. We grew with our neighbors into a world filled with more good than bad, regardless of what the day to day feels like. Stop and watch the homeless in a big city. Join a soup kitchen or charity. The connection to others and accomplishments are what make us great. The small window of time we have should inspire us to be the best we can be. To improve the world. To make our mark on it. We shape the future of an ENTIRE SPECIES AND PLANET.  Sometimes, I think we don't need a god. We haven't since we learned to understand the world around us.  It helped for me. I hope it helps for you. 😊"

The fact that you can only believe/be a part of/support a religion or spiritual ideology is a very tired and single-minded one. I'm an artist who loves music, art, and the people who are in my life.

AskTrollX,35s5bw,jillah92,2,Wed May 13 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"I've always been an atheist so I'm not sure if I can be helpful here or not.  But I'll try!  A lot of religion to me seems like ""a question wrongly asked"", including ""what is the meaning of life?""  I don't think there is any particular overarching meaning or that everyone finds the same purpose or enjoys the same things.  If you search for THE meaning of life, I believe it will be an empty search or end up filled with fantasies.  My approach to life is to lay out my own goals in terms of what I want for myself and my community and I work toward those goals for their own sake.  I focus a lot more on my values and priorities and doing what I feel is right each day than any meaningfulness at the end of it all.        I'm so sorry you're struggling with this, it sounds really rough.  I hope you can find support in your relationships and your community.  I think getting in touch with your heart and finding the things in life you truly love and want to pursue in the moment is worth these types of struggles <3 Good luck, you'll make it through"
AskTrollX,35s5bw,kaichai,2,Wed May 13 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Find something else to believe in. I know that sounds easier than it is but as I transitioned into an out-of-the-closet (mostly) athiest, I try to focus on what I do believe in.   I believe people are inherently good and want to help others, so while some people spend several hours in church each week, I spend several hours as a crisis counselor. It also helps to find others who share your belief (or dis-belief) to talk to about it. Don't focus on what happens after you die, focus on what's happening in your life now.   Another place that may help you find hope is checking out /r/RandomActsofCards or /r/RandomKindness or any other subs that have random giving. It's really small, but sending cards to random people is kind of awesome. Helping others gives me the meaning in my life that some people would find in religion and, if you give yourself time, you'll find your thing too.  Also, if you really are feeling like life is meaningless, it's possible that you may have lost faith in your faith but not faith in general and that's ok too. You're not alone."

AskTrollX,35qhru,GherkinJerkin,22,Tue May 12 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"My SO has known this coworker for almost 10 years, so there's some history there. They're closer than most coworkers tend to be but never hang out outside of work. He calls her his ""fairy godmother"" though she's only about 5 years older than he is. -Meaning that she's taken some kind of ""elder"" role in his life and he looks up to her A LOT. My problem: a lot of times he'll come to me with issues and I'll give him advice. He'll then say ""Well I already talked to Coworker about it and she said...."" and then explain that he's taking her advice instead. Or, we'll talk at length about something and he'll make a decision on it and then the next day completely revise what he said because ""Coworker told me...."". How can I view this situation differently so it stops getting under my skin? Two things: I'm totally not worried about anything inappropriate going on there. We've already talked at length about how I feel (multiple times) and he doesn't seem to get it. He views this as strictly a jealously issue; that I'm threatened by some other woman trying to take my man. I am jealous, but not because I think she wants in his pants. She's helping him make like 75% of all decisions he has in his life and that doesn't sit right with me. There are days where I feel like I'm dating him and her because he'll regurgitate ""things Coworker told me"" at length. It's at the point where I feel like he doesn't listen to me at all and takes everything she says as golden fact. @.@ halp."
AskTrollX,35qhru,lilbluehair,24,Tue May 12 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I were in your situation, the first thing I'd evaluate is whether or not this coworker gives good advice. Is your SO more successful/happy/etc than he would be if he didn't take her advice? If so, I personally wouldn't have a problem with it, but that's just me.  Now, if he's taking her advice and it's not turning out well, I would have a talk about that. Point out all the times it didn't turn out and have him evaluate her again as an advice-dispenser.  If you can't quite tell, and the constant ""coworker told me this"" is driving you up the wall, I can't really give you any advice you haven't already done - talk, talk, talk about it. Have you used the words you're using here with him? Does he know for a fact that you feel like she's more of a contributor in his life decisions than you? That you feel like he doesn't listen to you at all?  If you've already told him those exact things at length, and he still won't listen... I don't know. He should give you a reason for ignoring you, at least. Then you can decide if that reason is good enough, or if you need to leave."
AskTrollX,35qhru,lilbluehair,22,Tue May 12 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"Nothing has gone disastrously wrong and half the time she gives advice close to what I end up saying; it's more the fact that he so readily dismisses what I have to say and counters with what she's already told him. And I guess coming to me second is kind of an ego blow. Seems silly to me that at this stage in our lives/relationships I'm playing second fiddle to a coworker, even if they've known each other for so long. He views things as totally different. He doesn't think she's more of a contributor because he comes to me for advice on the same issues, even though he's already decided on her advice and is coming to me strictly as a courtesy so I feel involved. Since I'm the gf and she's just the coworker he can't understand why there's an issue there at all; he's dating me so I should just never feel put aside regardless of what he does because I'm the one he's dating. It's a ""you've already got me, what's the deal?"" view. And you said it a little better than I did - it feels like he's ignoring me. He talks to me but he has no intention of taking any of it to heart. It's really just him updating me on what he's already chosen so I know what's going on in his life and, at this point in the relationship, that's whack."
AskTrollX,35qhru,CHClClCl,26,Tue May 12 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"even though he's already decided on her advice and is coming to me strictly as a courtesy so I feel involved.   I'd tell him that specifically, it's powerful language and seems to exactly describe how you feel in a way he'll probably understand   he's dating me so I should just never feel put aside regardless of what he does because I'm the one he's dating. It's a ""you've already got me, what's the deal?"" view   This might sound harsh, but... ask him why you would want to date him when he ignores you. He might be thinking ""we're already a couple, so therefore I've shown her my commitment and don't need to try anymore"". He says you're ""dating"", but is he actually dating you or is he taking you for granted? He needs to realize that slapping a ""girlfriend/boyfriend"" label on your relationship isn't the only thing necessary for having a girlfriend. He has to actually keep trying, and part of having a life partner is listening to them and taking their input into consideration of your decisions.  Does he do this with just work decisions, or also for life decisions that affect you? If you're trying to decide on where to move, or what size apartment to get, or how to deal with your families, I don't understand why he would ask his coworker instead of just making a decision with you.  Maybe he feels insecure? Like, he feels that he's incapable of making big decisions, so he defers to her so he doesn't feel responsible if things go wrong?"
AskTrollX,35qhru,lilbluehair,15,Tue May 12 18:42:44 2015 UTC,"It's all decisions, big or small. Need a dentist referral? He'll use hers. We're trying to find a new apartment? He'll try to push us to look at the places/areas she's suggested over mine. He wants to lose weight - here babe, can you try to cook food from this diet she suggested? I think you really got it; he's TERRIFIED of making any kind of decision by himself and drops in to depression when he makes a wrong choice. I guess he's gotten in to the habit of defaulting to her advice since he admittedly views her as a motherly figure in his life (he has major mommy issues with his own so he's completely lacking that in his life). Gah, thank you so much! I can see what's going wrong here with more clarity now. It's much more about him not feeling secure as an adult and clutching perhaps a little too strongly on to what's now his only ""parental"" type figure in life. Can't fault him for wanting that but definitely gotta put in some work to getting him to feel more confident in the adult he is."

""I kind of feel that way about your coworker.  I'd definitely like for us to be more independent self-sustaining adults.  So maybe if you could only ask her for advice on some stuff instead of everything?  I mean, she's given good advice so far and everything but it just feels like it isn't us making the decisions, it's just another parent making decisions for us.  I feel like there's a million ways to do things, and doing them her way all the time might work but it isn't always best for us.""  Then every once in a while ask him ""oh, perhaps you could ask coworker about plumber recommendations?""  So she isn't entirely out of the loop.  If you're looking for more articles/advice on this I'd suggest googling something like ""boyfriend asks mother everything"" or ""mother controls boyfriends life"".  Not that she's his mother but... that seems to be more like the dynamic."

I wonder if he would be upset if you came to him with this? Some people would love if their SO shared this insight with them, and some people would get really defensive and not admit that was the problem at all. Maybe you can prepare for this conversation by making a mental list of all the good decisions he's made?  Personally, I beat myself up about bad decisions all the time. My therapist mentioned it over and over, hahaha. It's something in my brain that makes me only remember a bad decision, and not remember the good ones. Hopefully he can help himself out by mentally tallying the good decisions he makes each day? I really love mindfulness/meditation for that :)"
AskTrollX,35qhru,ScotchMcBagpipe,4,Tue May 12 19:58:18 2015 UTC,I'd come out and ask him why he asks your advice if already knows what to do.

AskTrollX,35qifn,jazzmunchkin69,10,Wed May 13 08:39:15 2015 UTC,"I happen to think you look gorgeous.   It is a hard dress to wear if you are not super super comfortable with all your lovely curves and showing them off. The areas that could be tricky with this dress, but could also be sexy if you feel really comfy with them are [that I would notice if it were my dress]:   The neckline is not well supported. It makes your boobs look awesome, but it may slip down, it may make bulges around the top, it may get awkward if you want to move around.  And, depending on the fabric, it may ride up around your waist. It looks as though it is doing so slightly in your pick, however in my opinion only the amount that is a cute show of your tiny li'l belly. Depending on the fabric it might scrunch up more around your waist (you have hips lady, damn) if you move around because of the fabric having more room around your little waist than it does around your full hips. It's up to you how much you want to be able to move around, and whether you mind readjusting the dress constantly. Is it stretchy or not stretchy fabric? Did it rumple up more when you wriggled around in it?  Complements -  Some of the nice things about this dress that I see are:  The colour is lovely, but won't stain easily.  The neckline is lovely on you.  It is hugging your hips and legs well, emphasising pretty curves.  There is no elaborate detail or difficult to match colours, so you can go pretty wild with accesories here, maybe an embroidered wrap/shawl/scarf?   The lines of the dress are flattering details, but fairly understated (not to distract from your gorgeous figure, or for that matter your likely sparkling conversation).  The dress is low cut, but knee length. A lot of people like to make just one area very showing and this dress is revealing but in this sense fairly balanced (usually it is considered a toss up between legs or cleavage, but those kind of rules are followed by people who slut shame usually, and not those who go ""I feel comfortable, I feel hot, I feel happy, ace, I win!"").   Spanx might help stop the dress wrinkling up, I've not tried that! It sounds good!   The special tape you can get to help it stick it up around the boob area was something I was also thinking.   You look very sexy, smart, and sleek and a million other adjectives. Have fun!"

And if you're concerned about it being too ""slutty,"" I'm not going to lie, it is a very sexy dress. So if you're going to be around elderly family members or co-workers, I would advise against just because it's usually better to go safe in those instances - only if conforming to those norms is important to you. it's okay if it isn't.  Otherwise, I think it's a nice dress. And as others have said, if you feel comfortable and confident in it, then absolutely wear it. If you're on the fence, try going for the spanx, as they make literally everyone look better in clothes, by design. (See Tina Fey's recent clip from Letterman)."

AskTrollX,35qifn,xMissElphiex,8,Wed May 13 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed with most of my other trolls.

AskTrollX,35qifn,nbyevu,6,Tue May 12 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"I learned this tip in college: for any dress that might be questionable in the sluttiness arena, you can instantly class it up with a little shrug or bolero until you get to the event and can gauge the room.   You look amazing in that dress, but strapless + deep plunge neckline makes it borderline scandalous, and it's tough to gauge this sort of thing before you get there. But throw a sequined shrug on and suddenly you look like you're going to the Met! You can take off the jacket later if you like."

I'll add that some extra boob support, either with a different bra or tape, is essential. Spanx to the under boob will also add slink and structure.   You can make this significantly less boobly with a substantial necklace to fill in some of that negative space between nips and chin, and also, I'd suggest a slinky wrap in a neutral colour that isn't the same as your skin. That will allow you to cover up during times of the evening when you want to lead with your face rather than your body, and can also come in handy if you have a wardrobe malfunction.

AskTrollX,35qxb9,katiebug88,3,Tue May 12 22:48:41 2015 UTC,whats the best way to network effectively?  I've been to networking events but then.... I don't know what to do next
AskTrollX,35qxb9,birthday-party,7,Tue May 12 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I find networking events are the worst places to actually network, because you run into the people that also need to be networking without finding anyone that can get you a job or refer you to someone that has an opening.  I typically go to happy hours put on by like-minded groups, or find one friend that knows a bunch of people within the industry and ask them to take you around with them. Meet their friends, befriend them, profit.   I find it's easier to have a conversation once you have an idea of what you like to do so you can be open-ended enough to have flexibility in the kind of job you want, but clear in your intentions so you don't seem wishy-washy."
AskTrollX,35qxb9,birthday-party,2,Wed May 13 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"thank you, that really helps! :)  - I go to lots of networking events but I just meet other students.  I have met one older industry professional who I keep in contact with tho - shes really nice and has become a bit of a mentor  anyway, what do you mean by happy hours put on by like minded people?  Can you be a bit more specific?"
AskTrollX,35qxb9,The_Panophobic,2,Wed May 13 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"Well, this may depend on what city you live in, and on your field. I occasionally browse Eventbrite and Meetup to see what's going on, and also look at specific places that I know have events—I'm in journalism, so I know Politico hosts speakers and has drinks beforehand and people mingling afterwards. It's not exactly networking, but I can usually find someone to speak to and potentially cling on to their group for a drink afterwards.   I also go to meetings of an online media group that has people speak on how aspects of journalism are changing, and it's a little more network-y. But in both types of events, I've met people that I've kept in touch with and ask them to invite me to the events they get invited to. Basically, keep expanding your circle and saying “Hey, I'm new to this area/am looking for a job/am looking to meet people. How should I do that?” And then you trade info and they invite you to things. Or you can just find someone you like and say you'd like to get coffee/drinks sometime, and then meet them and pick their brain and they'll likely find someone you should meet. People like to be helpful, and everyone has been there before, so I find that it never feels too pushy/needy, and there's nothing lost in asking.  EESH this is getting long. Sorry.   TL;DR Cling to the people you meet. Make plans with them and then follow through. Meet the people they know. Meet their people's people. $$$$."

AskTrollX,35qxb9,24sarahsal,2,Wed May 13 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"Regarding happy hours, most industries have professional groups, and many cities have young professionals social groups--social activities but panned with networking and career development in mind. Seeking out and joining groups like that will help you meet people. Things that are just networking events aren't great, but groups that plan speakers, courses, and other more development-oriented events are better."

AskTrollX,35qkos,CharlotteCorday_,3,Tue May 12 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"We are both in our last year of university and have job offers in the same city next year, but his is dependent on him getting the right grades in his upcoming exams. We are planning to live together, and we have been talking as if he will definitely get the job and we will be fine, but obviously we have to be prepared if he doesn't. It's more difficult because he's an international student so home for him is really quite far away.  This morning I had a total freak-out about not being able to afford a flat on my own, and he had to calm me down and get me to go actually figure out my finances. Turns out I'll be just about ok, and I'm feeling much better, but the whole thing has just made him more stressed because it just reminded him that it makes a difference to both of us, not just him.   Now that I'm feeling more in control of my back-up plans, I feel terrible about throwing all of this on him now, while he is still revising for his exams. I'm not nearly so worried now, and I want to get that across without it sounding like I've assumed he will fail and have made alternative plans. I suck at words. What do I say to make him feel better?"
AskTrollX,35qkos,GherkinJerkin,5,Tue May 12 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"If you suck at words, maybe try something else? You know he's crazy stressed out right now - what can you do to make things easier on him? Bring him some lunches/dinners so he doesn't have to worry about cooking while he studies? Bring him his favorite coffee one morning when you know he's got a full day? Do some laundry for him or pick up a chore he's been pushing off? You know him best, find a way to show your support in a way you know he'll appreciate. Sometimes when we're worn totally thin it's all the effort someone puts in to making us feel better that matters most, not the words. :) Best of luck to both of you!!"
AskTrollX,35qkos,cutehulhu,3,Tue May 12 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"I think the best course of action now is to do something nice together when he has a little time. Go have a drink, or dinner. Maybe go bowling, something he likes and that helps him unwind. Do it when he wouldn't be studying anyway. I assume he takes even short breaks! Start off your plans by apologizing for your freak-out (which is not something you need to apologize for regularly) but make it clear to him that you were not thinking straight. Assure him that not that much actually depends on this (even if it does). Down time is just as important as studying, so you can help him relax and get him to do stuff so he gets enough sleep.  Also make it a point to ask how you can help him right now, at the beginning of your date. Would he like you to help him revise, or take him out every so often or just leave him to himself completely?   Finally, you're not bad at words. Just tell him what you told us! You feel bad and don't want him to assume you're counting on him failing.  Anyway, fingers crossed for both of you! I hope you do get to live together and if not, there's so many more jobs and opportunities that will give you that chance. Don't lose hope if this doesn't work out - it only delays you a little! Good luck!"

Not gonna lie, this is the weirdest thing to get used to (and that's why I recommend doing this RIGHT before bed and never during day time when you have to touch anything) but when my hands fray and crack in winter it does miracles. You could also try doing this and then wearing gloves but I couldn't stand it. Essentially the vasaline creates a moisture barrier that keeps all that good lotion/oil on your skin and ""seals"" it in allowing it really sink down in. For day time use I like Lubriderm Skin Nourishing with Sea Kelp."

You can often find it at stores like Whole Foods and New Seasons. They have a whole line of great products too, eye cream, hand cream, facial cleanser and lotion. It's non scented, but also not greasy. I'll use hydrocortisone if it's really bad, but I haven't needed to since using this lotion regularly.

AskTrollX,35qeip,wakame,3,Tue May 12 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"Get some little spa gloves, smear a ton of cream on your hands before bed and sleep with the gloves on. It should help you over the course of the next day. It can be weird to sleep with the gloves on, but its better than the greasy feeling during the day.   Also, try not to wash your hands a lot. Obviously we need to wash our hands, but make sure you only wash them when you need to, and don't use too hot of water. If hand sanitizer doesn't irritate your skin, use it sometimes instead of washing. Make sure to put the cream on after washing, even though its greasy. And use dish/rubber/work gloves when doing dishes, cleaning, gardening, or anything wet or dirty.   Maybe try blotting your hands on a paper towel after putting on the cream to try and eliminate the greasy feeling without washing?"

I haven't really tried this, so obviously YMMV.  If you're super-hydrating at night, you can probably get away with a normal moisturizer on your hands and keep it in your bag during the day to use as needed. Bonus that face moisturizer typically comes in a smallish tube. And you could go into a Sephora/Ulta/something and test them out on your hands and make sure you don't have slippery hands."

AskTrollX,35qq03,smalltownheart,3,Wed May 13 04:42:49 2015 UTC,I've always thought that I'd never be so desperate for clear sinuses that I'd attempt to drown myself. The whole process freaks me out!!
AskTrollX,35qq03,elizafallingup,3,Wed May 13 06:50:29 2015 UTC,"There are lots of youtube vids about it (if you can stomach them) demonstrating the use of a neti pot. I find it's great for my allergies. I tend to use it in the shower because I can wash off any gooky stuff that happens.   How it's done:  Lean forward, tilt your head to the side and press the spout up to the nostril that is pointing upward and slowly tip the pot until the water starts to flow. Go slowly at first to gauge your comfort. Breathe through your mouth -  you can use you throat and tongue muscles to prevent the water from going down the back of your throat. The water is going to flow out the opposite nostril which is kinda funny but as long as you are leaning forward it won't go down the front of your shirt but instead will go down the drain.   Use half the pot in one nostril and then repeat in the opposite side.   After completion blow your nose, lean your head from side to side to make sure ALL the water is out. Blow your nose often after because you will have drainage. This is normal because it's the thick blockage coming loose. Blowing your nose prevents post-nasal drip. (ew.) It will probably take a good 10 minutes before you fully feel the effects. I do not recommend laying down for at least 30 minutes. Your sinuses will take a little time to go back to normal but once they do, you will be breathing way better and you will not be as stuffy."
AskTrollX,35qq03,Krakenzmama,2,Wed May 13 23:34:48 2015 UTC,that's an excellent explanation. FOr some reason I am terrified of trying it tho!

AskTrollX,35qq03,atsigns,2,Mon May 18 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"It can be very helpful, depending on why I'm stuffed up. If it's from allergies, or a cold it'll usually be a nice relief. If it's because my sinuses are swollen, it won't do a damn thing.  Mine is a small squeeze bottle with a straw, so the liquid is pulled from the bottom of the bottle. I normally just use warm water from the tap after I pour the salt packet in. It is pretty easy to use in the shower.  Simply stick it in one nostril, tilt your head the opposite way, open your mouth, and pour/squeeze. You should be able to breathe through your mouth just fine. I suggest breathing out at first, to make sure you don't choke on salty-snot water."

When my mom showed me how to do it she told me to breath through my mouth while I squeeze the bottle causing it to go through my nose. I don't like the mouth breathing thing, so I just hold my breath and do it. Between each nostril I like to blow my nose a bunch into a bath towel.  It helps me a lot. It gets all the snot out of my nose and lets me breath for a little bit, also I think part of the idea is that it's clearing some of the allergens you've been breathing in out for a little bit."

It's an important distinction. Fantasizing means it's something he wants, something he dreams about. That is not the case.  Do you think he wants to date the random girl on Youporn? Of course not! He's been dating you for three years, and you still have sex almost every day.  Porn is just something to look at to put arousing thoughts and images in your head, to trick your body into being able to orgasm.  Getting mad at him for being aroused by sexual thought is like getting mad at him for thinking McDonald's burgers smell good, even though he told you he loves YOUR cooking the best."

And it's not stuff I really want - it's not anything I would ever want to do in real life. It's for me, for my sexuality away from him; it has nothing to do with him. Even when you're coupled, you still are an individual with your own thoughts and feeling that have nothing to do with the other person.  I strongly think this is your issue. What he's doing is totally normal and healthy and I think you're feeling insecure - which is not a feeling you want making decisions for you. Now, with that said - I totally get it! Everyone at some point feels insecure! But I don't think you should make that issue his issue. You need to know that you are enough. Human sexuality is a weird thing and sometimes people just like to fantasize about stuff, for whatever reason, that they would never want to do in real life.

I know and am okay with the fact my bf masturbates. It's normal, healthy, I do it occasionally too (though much less than him). I'm okay with porn, for the most part, but I have gotten upset at him in the past because I felt like it was affecting the frequency of our sex. He's been wonderful though, he's cut back some, and we've been having sex probably 5-7 times/week since (I should add that we've been dating for 3 years and we live together).   Recently, however, I've found out that he masturbates to the idea of having sex with other women. I realize this is normal, but I have never done it, ever, and I just don't completely understand. When I masturbate I'm either thinking about him/us or about situations, but never about a certain person. It just feels so... dirty, like I'm betraying my bf. Idk. Doesn't turn me on at all.   He's also told me that most of my male friends have probably masturbated to me at some point in time, which I didn't really need to know, but that just makes me wonder which of my girlfriends he's masturbated to, imagining having sex with them (hurl).   Like I said, I've never done this, and I can't really understand the reasoning behind it. If it were just the porn, the sexual acts, etc that are helping him get off, I get it, but I don't get the need to actually think about having sex with a specific person.   I feel like I'm being crazy, but just thinking about it makes me nauseous. It makes me feel like I'm not enough, that I'll never be enough (and I think I'm pretty damn good-looking!). How do I get over this?"
AskTrollX,35o8iu,raziphel,11,Tue May 12 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that for plenty of people, what they fantasize about is quite distinct from what they actually want. I'm a confident feminist woman with a very kind, empathetic, feminist boyfriend who drives me wild in bed. But when I masturbate, may of my fantasies involve non-consensual situations (to put it lightly). Does that mean I ""actually"" want to be raped? No. freaking. way.  The psyche is an odd thing and a non-literal thing. Have you ever fantasized about something without actually wanting to do it? Like even yelling at someone who's rude to you in traffic or whatever."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,raziphel,7,Tue May 12 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I really appreciate everything you said, and it definitely makes me feel better!  He does know I'm uncomfortable with it, and he's actually pretty ashamed of masturbation/porn. I really encourage him not to be, but I may be sending a different message when I get upset. ;(   I think I will ask about what he specifically thinks, maybe that will help shed some light on his thought process. And as for your last point, I almost obnoxiously bother him about kinks/what turns him on, but he's either shy or fairly vanilla. I'll keep trying!"
AskTrollX,35o8iu,adreamtomeat,17,Tue May 12 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"This is going to come across a little harsh, but please trust that it's coming from a place of constructive compassion.    You do understand that part of the reason he's ashamed of this is because you're uncomfortable with it, right?  A lot of what you communicate is non-verbal: facial expressions, tone, body language, etc.  These things are hard to pay attention to sometimes and take practice.    He needs to have space to have his own thoughts.  You're not Jesus; thinking of a relationship sin must not equal the act in your mind.  He's not fucking whomever he's jerking off to.  ""Don't think things that make me uncomfortable"" is, honestly, kind of controlling, and I think it would be helpful for you to find where the insecurity that causes this is stemming from and explore it.  Trust that he's not going to cheat on you, or that you're no less valuable to him because of this.  Don't confuse the small issue with a big one.  He tried opening up to you about something and you are, probably unintentionally, guilting him for it.  If you ask what his kinks are and what turns him on, but shy away from the things he says, he's not going to keep opening up to you.  This goes double if he's shy.  If you're pushing for him to open up, but shy away when he does, you're sending mixed messages.  What I would suggest:   Sharing kinks and stuff is great, but him some privacy of thought.  Fantasies are just fantasies, after all, and not everything needs to be shared. Find things you can share together.  Watch porn together, maybe, or let him talk about banging people you don't know.  Wear a wig and pretend to be someone else.  Talk about how great that porn star might feel.  Whatever.  There are a lot of options that you can explore and ways you guys can compromise, so that you can actually share fantasies without either of you feeling bad/uncomfortable.  It'll take a little practice. Accept that your fantasies might just straight-up differ. Do some introspection and discover why this makes you uncomfortable.  Were you cheated on?  Did cheating effect your parents?  Is this a self-esteem issue? Communicate why this made you uncomfortable to him.  You doing work in your head is great, but not telling him that you are working on it won't make him feel more comfortable (and won't fix the relationship issue).  ex: ""I have issues with (cheating) from (a douchey ex-boyfriend/my parents divorce), and that's making this particular subject hard for me.  I trust you not to do anything stupid, but this is just something I'm working on in my head, and those previous experiences make it hard at times.  I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.""  You'd have to tailor that to the situation, but he needs to know that he's safe and that you're not going to get mad for thinking ""normal"" things.  Yes, this is normal. He's not going to open up until he feels safe.  You need to encourage that.  The first step is making sure that you are stable.   At least it's not children... or animals, corpses, murder, a family member, rape... there's a whole shitload of things that this could be, but isn't.  Try to keep things in perspective here.  TLDR: find a way to compromise and work together."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,hotheadnchickn,2,Tue May 12 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think I needed this!  I actually spoke to him some this morning and last night, and I think it was mostly coming from my insecurities, rather than something that's happened to me in the past. I was worried that he was comparing me to the women he was looking at, or even thinking about other women during our sex. He assured me that he wasn't, and even shared to me the two times he ever did (they were pretty minor, and I can deal with 2/800).   or that you're no less valuable to him because of this.   This was definitely my worry.  Anyways, again, thank you. I guess we didn't exactly come to a compromise, but I feel much better and I think I'm looking at this in a healthier way now."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,CHClClCl,3,Tue May 12 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing to remember: he's comparing you to them and you win because you're the one with him.  So what if he rubs one out on occasion thinking about Sally or Jenna or Jessica Rabbit or whomever.  He's not lying, cheating, creeping, or obsessing with them, and he trusts you enough to talk about it with you.    I can all but guarantee he thinks about you at times, too.    As long as he's not calling other people's names out during sex, of course.  That would just be careless.    Insecurity is a real bear to deal with sometimes.  It takes patience, understanding, and effort, but you're dealing with this right now and working through it.  This is what working through insecurity looks like, by the way.  You have an issue with something, then you deal with it.  Having a healthier perspective is the first step.  By the way, when I say ""compromise"", I don't mean ""you solely compromising your feelings"", I mean you two finding an agreeable middle ground.  Your feelings are very important, and these are gray areas.  Learning to communicate these issues in a healthy way is a more important skill anyway, because that's what everything else is built upon.  Good job, by the way.  :)"
AskTrollX,35o8iu,randy_buttcheese,10,Tue May 12 18:18:15 2015 UTC,No why would ask for details? That's probably just going to make her feel worse. Why not let him keep his fantasies private . I mean if she's into it that would make sense but it sounds like it makes her uncomfortable to hear about it.
AskTrollX,35o8iu,ScreamingFayeRae,7,Tue May 12 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"That's not to say there's nothing you can't do. You're clearly bothered by this and you should communicate that to your SO; be totally honest! Ask him what he thinks about specifically or why he thinks about other girls or if he even knows why. I mean, you can't become someone else, but that does open the doors to some kinks! Like you can cosplay, embrace some fantasies he has, and he can do the sane for you. It doesn't have to be a lookalike to any of your girlfriends, hell, it could ve a fictious woman or creature! Bottomline though is, unless there's other serious signs, he isn't cheating on you, physically or mentally. He may be exploring his sexuality and leaving you out of it, which, isn't right because you should be able to talk about that stuff and work it out after being together that long. He should be more open with you and you can help coax that out of him. Don't be alarmed or think that you're losing your edge; you're every bit the awesome woman he met 3 years ago!   I disagree with a lot of this. Why ask for details? Won't that make her feel worse?   Why isn't it right for him to leave her out of occasional private fantasies? It doesn't mean there's things he wants to do that he isn't tell her, and even if there are things he's not ready to say yet--how is that wrong? He has a the right to a private life in his mind that he doesn't have to tell other people about. He has a right to a sexual fantasy he doesn't repeat to her. That doesn't mean he's hiding. It's a relationship, not a deposition."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,dragon-pet,4,Tue May 12 07:00:27 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, you're absolutely perfect and this has nothing to do with you <3  Being in a relationship doesn't mean that you can magically shut off all the thoughts about other people.  It means that you've found the only person you want to be intimate with - the only person you want to build a life with.  If he only masturbated to thoughts of you it'd probably lead to a lot of contempt.  Imagine what would happen if he masturbated to fucking you in the ass, but you don't do anal?  Either he's got a REALLY good imagination or he's basically imagining anally raping you.  And if he does have a good imagination, he's still essentially creating another person to masturbate to - it's just based off of you.  It's also pretty important to not always imagine a ""perfect"" version of your current partner though - 'cause then you'll always be disappointed by the real version that you're stuck with.  He knows your personality, he knows your likes, he knows your absolute no-nos.  It'd probably even be hard for him to masturbate thinking about doing things you don't really enjoy.  Not saying that he masturbates thinking about horrible things, just at least when I masturbate it tends to be incredibly me-focused and I couldn't care less if my imaginary partner gets off.   Also, try it for yourself!  Get a nice vibrator, find some porn you like (there's a really wide variety of it) and get lost in a fantasy or two."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,raziphel,2,Tue May 12 07:19:57 2015 UTC,"I know this feeling you're talking about because I went through it as well with my ex. Your feelings DO matter, but you should reflect and ask yourself why this is so troubling. In my case, my feelings stemmed from deep rooted problems where I had great fears of abandonment, being cheated on, etc...I thought I trusted my ex but in fact I did not. I felt like my value and worth diminished when he looked at porn of other women, and I would think things like 'why am I not good enough for you?'   My self esteem was very low and my upbringing made sex a very taboo subject. In other words, I had so many insecurities about myself that were all beneath the surface and I didn't notice them until things like this had happened. I suggest you look within and see if you are feeling insecure, based on what you said already I think you do feel a bit so."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,hotheadnchickn,5,Tue May 12 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"This could indicate some deeper problems with your relationship.  His shame and guilt aren't going to fix the situation even if it motivates him in the short term.    Its important that you make it clear to him that this is not ok and that his 'everybody does it' response is not in any way acceptable and attempts to discount and delegitimize your feelings.  Please accept that this may be something that does not change, and also accept that you are completely justified in ending your relationship if you continue to be unhappy."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,raziphel,23,Tue May 12 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"""Its important that you make it clear to him that this is not ok and that his 'everybody does it' response is not in any way acceptable and attempts to discount and delegitimize your feelings.""  But it is OK.  I think she should let him know that it makes her feel bad, but not that it's not OK.  It should be a lesson for her to express her feelings and then allow herself to examine where they come from and what she does to deal with them.    OP, I was like you.   My partner of the time masturbated and fantasized about other people and I let that affect my self worth and to stop the bad feels, I wanted him to stop with the actions that were giving me the bad feels.  But that's unrealistic for something like masturbating and fantansies, they are private things that people do.  It's not up to other people to make your feels better, that's up to you, and only you.  You can include him in the discussion, but look for a way to move past it with him, not to stop him from doing it."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,hotheadnchickn,15,Tue May 12 08:44:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but controlling how he thinks is an unreasonable expectation, especially if it only stays in his head.  Everyone deserves some level of privacy."

AskTrollX,35o8iu,DefinitelyNotFreud,3,Tue May 12 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"How someone expresses their thoughts and feelings can certainly be up for debate and discussion of course, because that can be done in either good or bad ways, but the thoughts are his alone.    This also really isn't something worth ending a relationship over (yet).  Let's not jump to that conclusion."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,kanad3,2,Tue May 12 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, of course."

AskTrollX,35o8iu,ironranger88,2,Tue May 12 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is something people under 25 or under 30 believe. I think if you asked a couple in their 50's and 60's you might get some different answers. Sure, swinging and poly stuff have been around as long as sex has, in a way, but people's general expectations, and what they consider ""normal"" I think depends a lot on their age and their environment growing up.  I'm not saying anyone is right or wrong, but cultural norms shift over time. My partner (who is a heterosexual man) thinks using porn is cheating, and thinks fantasizing about other people is disrespectful to your partner. Is that because of his age, or where he was raised (not North America), or just who he is? Maybe, I dunno, but I know he gets offended when people say stuff like ""all men like porn"" or ""all men fantasize about every attractive woman they know"" because it's not true for every man, and it's offensive to men to stereotype the expression of their sexuality that way. There are men in the world who don't like porn, and it's silly and reductionist to suggest that they're not real men for that reason."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,dragon-pet,2,Tue May 12 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, people that are 50-60 were raised in a much more sexist and restricting society, so it makes sense he is that way."
AskTrollX,35o8iu,raziphel,2,Tue May 12 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"... I think lots of things these days are just as or more sexist than the way things were in the 50's and 60's. And what the 50's and 60's are like depends on which town and county or province or state you're in, let alone country or part of the world, or whatever else helps identify the time and cultural period.  I hope you aren't suggesting my partner is sexist because he doesn't find porn arousing.  Edit: The 60's in certain areas were arguably more liberated and less sexist than most or all of the world today. So... I don't know what you're suggesting, except that norms shift and change."
AskTrollX,35nauy,Newni,4,Mon May 11 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority on this one, but generally the part of porn that appeals to me is watching the girl enjoying herself. As a dude, the guy in the scene really serves no purpose other than as a placeholder for me in my imagination. Lesbians presumable use toys, strap-ons, etc, so the concept of ""fucking"" the girl you're with shouldn't be entirely foreign.  So do any of you watch or enjoy it on that level? Or is just the very presence of a dude too much of an ""ick factor?"""
AskTrollX,35nauy,mariesoleil,3,Mon May 11 22:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do. Porn for me has recently been more about wondering what it feels like for her. I can do that without being attracted to the dude."
AskTrollX,35nauy,LENIN-WAS-A-MUSHROOM,2,Tue May 12 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"No, because the sex in typical straight porn doesn't look comfortable, let alone hot.

AskTrollX,35ih9z,pm_me_pokemon_pics,62,Sun May 10 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"You are not a blank slate. You are not a mirror. You are more than your reflection in other people's eyes.  How people feel about you are their own responsibility.  Self esteem comes within.   If you feel your own self worth is tied to how other people see you, you'll always be disappointed because you cannot control their feelings.  Take a moment and list all the things you like and dislike about yourself. The dislikes list is probably longer, huh?  Now think about the people in your life. List the things you like and dislike about them. The likes list is probably dominating the dislikes list.  Why?  Why the right royal fuck are you so much kinder on other people than your own damn self? You and yourself have been together the longest. After a while you start to get sick of their shit, right? Happens in all long term relationships.  So I'll give you the same advice I'd give someone who loves their SO but has let the little annoyances get in the way of their love: work on it, change those ""I don't like the way you..."" statements into ""I love the way you...""  Affirmation statements are pretty cliche at this point but if that's what you need, they're necessary.   If that doesn't work then try something else, whatever it takes for you to get to a place where you realize that you are a whole person who deserves your own respect.  Hugs.

AskTrollX,35ih9z,KindOwl,26,Mon May 11 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"This comment by /u/JaneD73 really helped me.   I'm kind of new to reddit, and this is a long comment; I hope it's not out of place.   I've been working to become a certified foster parent. I've also been reflecting about the way I usually talk to myself. I tend to focus on regrets, feeling inadequate compared to others, and being kind of down on myself. I can get into a negative spiral, where my negative self-worth seems to sap my motivation to do better today, and this just perpetuates the cycle.   So lately, I've tried something new. I imagine that I'm a foster child under my own care. I imagine that my traumatic early experiences have resulted in some less-than-ideal patterns of thoughts and behavior. And now I need to summon all the love, kindness, patience, and wisdom I have, to help this child heal and begin to learn new and better ways of thinking and acting.   So for example, if I'm feeling anxious about an upcoming event I need to attend, I might say to myself, ""You seem to be feeling anxious. What's bothering you? Are you worried that people won't like you, or that you'll look dumb? You know, I sometimes worry about that kind of thing, too. But I've noticed that actually, most people aren't really judging me so much. I do that to myself. In my experience, most people respond well when I just smile and say hi. Extend your friendship and warmth and kindness, and then just relax, and allow them to respond in kind.""  If I'm feeling bad about overeating, for example, I'll think about what I've done over the past couple days, and find things to praise. ""Wow, I'm really proud of you for getting up early yesterday to exercise. Didn't that feel great? I've noticed that my day gets off to a good start when I get up early and work out - what a mood lifter! You've been doing really well with that!"" And then maybe I'll add something like, ""I notice that you don't feel as well when you eat too much junk food. I'm so sorry that you're not feeling well. Maybe next time, you'd feel better if you reached for some fruit instead. Would it help you if I washed these grapes and put them out on the counter now, so you'd have them handy when you were feeling like snacking?""  If I'm feeling overwhelmed by a big laundry pile, and am tempted to just ignore it, I'll say, ""You don't much feel like doing the laundry today, do you? Well, how about if we just spend 5 minutes making a little dent in it? Baby steps like that make a big task feel easier."" Then if I actually do it, I say, ""Good for you! You're really learning to be more responsible every day! I'm so proud of you!""   If I start to get annoyed at somebody or some situation, I might say to myself, ""I notice you're getting that tight feeling in your chest that you get when you're starting to get upset. What are you upset about? This line is kind of moving slowly, isn't it? That can be frustrating when you're in a rush. But let's look at the clock. You still have enough time to get to your next appointment. A few extra minutes here won't mess up your day. You're doing just fine. I'm sure the cashier is doing her best. Maybe she's having a stressful day. When we get up in line, let's try to help her day go a little better. Just smile and be kind and patient with her. Wouldn't that be a nice service to that poor lady with this stressful job?""  Or let's say I spent too long web surfing, and now I'm feeling like a lazy bum, I'll say something like: ""Hmm, I notice you're not feeling too great right now. What do you think is going on? It seems like maybe you feel worse when you spend too long on-line. That's an interesting observation. It can be fun to relax and spend a little time on-line. I wonder what the right balance is. Maybe you could try setting a timer next time, for 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. Then when it rings, you could turn off the computer, and do something else for a while. Then you could see how that affects your mood. Does that sound like a good plan? I just want you to be happy, and I wonder if setting some limits on your screen time might help you feel happier in the long run.""  If I have a whole day where I'm just really not being my best self, I might say, ""You're having a rough day, aren't you? We all have our bad days. That's o.k. That's part of being human. We're all learning and growing together. We're all works in progress. I still love you. You're doing all right. Tomorrow is a new day.""  I realize this long comment probably makes me sound a little crazy - talking to myself all day, and treating myself like a lost little child. But I feel like it's making a difference in my life. I've noticed that the more I try to be kind and patient with myself, the more peaceful and happy I feel. I'm also getting more done, making better decisions, and I'm more patient with other people, too.   I've also started repeating these words to myself a lot - my own little made-up mantra:   ""There's no one to impress. No one to beat. No one to intimidate or be intimidated by.  There's no judge or jury or audience. There's no competition, no performance. There are only people to love. There's only a relationship between a loving God and his beloved child.""  (I know most people on reddit aren't religious, so feel free to ignore that last bit, if it doesn't resonate with you. But it's been an important part of the puzzle for me, as I've begun to find more peace in my life. As I say these words, I feel the tension and anxiety flowing out of me, and peace and calm flow in.)   TL;DR: Be your own loving foster parent.    Hugs."

If your partner decides that the relationship is not working, it won't matter if you have perfect hair, a rack that was sent directly from the gods, or possess a voice that sounds like honey being poured over expensive bourbon in a cut-glass tumbler, because some people are simply not attracted to others for reasons that no-one really understands.  Being dumped is gut-wrenchingly horrible. It makes you feel worthless and insecure, but please remember that the end of a relationship is in no way a reflection on you.

AskTrollX,35jzce,VestaDear,4,Mon May 11 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to explain the situation. My aunt works on a Native American reservation as a teacher, and so she is a first hand witness to a lot of horrible stuff that the kids have to go through. Many of her students there have little to no structured family life: parents and siblings with drug addiction, substance abuse, money problems etc. Basically no support and no good role models, and its a very hard cycle to break. One of her former students, who is now the same age as me, managed to break this cycle, and went to an out of state college. She is the first of her family to go to college.   However, it's been very hard for her to make friends there, and she feels very alone. She lived with my aunt before she left and did not pay rent, did not clean up after herself, and basically made it very hard for my aunt to continue to let her live there. Now she's coming back for the summer, and my grandparents and aunt fear the same will happen. My aunt already dipped into her savings the first time, and it's hard for her to support herself already.   I come from a very different background. I am middle class, white, and have had to face very minimal hardships in my life. Both of my parents have college degrees, I go to a well-respected university, and money is, objectively, not a problem for me. I say all of this because I really want to help this girl. I cannot imagine how hard it must be for her to leave her family and the only life she has ever known and try to succeed in a completely different world.  I really, really want to help support her, to let her know that she has a friend if she needs one, etc. but I don't know how to do that because I'm not sure how it would come off to her being from background that I'm from. The last thing that I would want to do is come off as condescending. My aunt and grandparents have done quite a bit to help her but I think it would be nice for her to have someone her own age supporting her as well; the only thing is that our age and status as college students are the only common ground that we share. She also lives quite far away from me so our primary form of communication, if any, would be over text/facebook/email/phone and maybe the occasional in-person visit.   Any suggestions/personal experiences are greatly appreciated."

I was on free lunch in elementary school for a few year and I don't know what it's like.

A few years ago I found that I was using alcohol to try to force myself to have fun in situations with people whom I didn't really like, while doing things I found boring or worse.

I notice I feel a lot better drinking caffeine free soda and going for calming teas (chamomille, lavender, and generally any tisane). Coffee is an occasional treat and mornings only.  Also, you can drink socially without getting smashed. Limit yourself to a certain number of drinks (with non alcoholic ones in between) and then afterwards stick to soda. Absolutely no shots or chugging. No drinking on an empty stomach (even if very little it gives you headaches). No drinking very fast (you need to control your buzz)."
AskTrollX,35gpec,pusheen_the_cat,11,Sun May 10 06:27:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm pretty sure it's not that I get smashed, it's more that the alcohol exacerbates my anxiety so much the next day, that I spend the next few days feeling like a made a fool of myself and being uncontrollably hard on myself, just for relaxing a little and having fun (laughing, being loud, silly). Your advice is otherwise spot-on though.   It's frustrating because until recently I could barely leave the house unmedicated, and then I discovered that I could stand social situations with a little help from alcohol. But I'm really noticing the depressive after affects :("
AskTrollX,35gpec,pusheen_the_cat,10,Sun May 10 08:11:29 2015 UTC,Then staying away from it sounds like a good idea. Alcohol is a depressant so it's no wonder it messes up with you.
AskTrollX,35gpec,BubbleSpace,6,Sun May 10 13:14:52 2015 UTC,"It takes a LOT of practice, but you've got to give yourself some extra love in the days after you're social.  Every time you catch yourself saying, ""Why the hell did I say...?"" or some variation, NOTICE that you're judging yourself, pat yourself on the back + let it go.  Like I said, this takes so much work, because those instincts to judge yourself are ingrained over a lifetime.    Also, it helps to put a night out of silly fun in context -- ""laughing, being loud, silly"" can be GOOD things, and you probably weren't the only one!  Chances are, the things that you're judging yourself on: ie, ""Why did I laugh like that at that joke?"" are things that no one noticed."
AskTrollX,35gpec,ladiezzz,3,Sun May 10 14:53:21 2015 UTC,"That's cause those are your inhibitions! When you sober up, your inhibitions about laughing, being loud, silly, come roaring back and you get driven crazy by it.  I find it hard to stop drinking once I get started (though I can't drink at all right now), but if the issue is anxiety over what you did, then even being a little drunk might trigger that.  Social anxiety is rough, and I'd say that's the core of the issue, not alcohol. Maybe address that with the standard methods (therapy, drugs, writing, etc.) if you aren't already rather than just quitting alcohol?"

AskTrollX,35gpec,Dads_Antacid_Pills,1 point,Wed May 13 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"My family has a very long and very bad relationship with alcohol. Before I was old enough to ever be exposed to alcohol as an early teen, I'd seen just how powerful and destructive alcohol could be when abused, and that really impacted my attitude. I think I was maybe 13 or 14 when I resolved to break the pattern in my family and to never, under any circumstances, become drunk.   Since then, I've never finished a drink. I occasionally will have a cold bottle of beer or a half a glass of wine or a jigger or two of something harder, but I only have one and I never finish it. That little bit of alcohol at the bottom of the container represents my power over addiction and my struggle to break my family's cycle. I've only ever felt a light buzz and I always take that as a sign that I've had enough. Oftentimes in social situations, I simply won't drink even when everyone else is. The nice thing is that some very brave and hard working people before me have battled their alcoholism and won, so bartenders are ready to fill a glass with seltzer water and cranberry juice or fill a martini glass with chilled water so other people don't feel uncomfortable drinking around me.   The great thing is that it's worked. I'm well passed the ages that my other family members developed their addictions and I'm fine. I average maybe four drinks a year. It's totally possible to feel perfectly comfortable in social situations without a social lubricant.   As for the anxiety.... that has to be addressed. Feeling that way around other people is not something you deserve, rather you deserve the opportunity to enjoy being in social situations. I don't know much about you or your situation, but arranging a few friendly chats with a licensed psychologist (or ""thought doctor"", as I like to call them) seems like an excellent option if you've not tried that already. I've previously suffered from anxiety and depression and I found that a combination of exercise and therapy did wonders for me.   One of the things I learned is that, as hippy-dippy as it sounds, self-acceptance is absolutely vital. Often times we can internalize things like social pressures and the expectations of others, and when those things find their way inside of us, it's like they get caught in an echo chamber that magnifies them a thousand-fold. You basically become your own worst bully. Your relationship with yourself shouldn't be a bully-victim relationship, though, it should be more akin to best friends. The things we say to ourselves internally can sometimes be absolutely horrific, and we're not even aware we're saying them. They're things we'd never say to other people, particularly people we love. You should be supportive of yourself, and never go past supportive constructive criticism. You should congratulate yourself on your successes, and encourage yourself when you occasionally stumble, because everyone stumbles and that doesn't make you any worse a person or any less deserving of love and acceptance. Once I started putting this attitude into practice, my anxiety started to disappear. I realized that I was making myself feel anxious, it wasn't other people, and that I could change that."

No. I felt skeevy when I found Maxims belonging to an ex hidden in my current boyfriend's drawer (because they kept getting delivered to my house so he got them and hid them).  If he's not hiding his behavior from you, I wouldn't feel skeevy. Insecure, perhaps, but skeevy, no.  Fact of the matter is, we are all attracted to many people. We may fall in love with just a few select people in our lifetimes, but I don't believe there's a human alive who will only find their significant other attractive.  The key is to be open and honest about it. Teasing helps, too. My husband watched Morning Edition on CNN because he thinks the host, Robin, is hot. I get it. She is very beautiful, and when I hear her being goofy on television in the morning I holler down, ""How's your girlfriend?"" to him.  And as for me, we just finished watching the entire ""Firefly"" series (all one season) and movie because I find Nathan Fillion to be the hottest thing since sliced bread. My husband even put ""Serenity"" on the big screen in his ""man cave"" so I could ""Watch my boyfriend up close and life size.""  Now, A key factor that may be a differentiator here is that this is a blogger, i.e. not someone big time famous, but a girl next door type. As long as he's not messaging her or trying to start up something with her, just let it slide. Figure out what he likes about her, is there anything about her that he finds attractive that might also be why he's attracted to you?  Bring it up, share it more openly, and you disarm the ""skeevy""-ness as a psychological weapon.  You will feel jealousy or concern throughout your romantic relationships in life. As long as your boyfriend isn't stepping out on you, emotionally or physically, then the problem is yours to deal with and fix, not him. Now if you find he is taking it a step or three further, it's time for a frank talk.  Good luck!"

AskTrollX,35dwrf,speedycat2014,18,Sat May 9 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"I have to respectfully disagree with you here. (BTW RES shows me I've upvoted you 9 times in the past, so clearly this is one of the few places where we disagree.)  To me, the line is where a person in a committed relationship attempts to emotionally or physically go beyond ""just looking"" with that other person. Engaging them in flirtatious email discourse, or trying to hook up passes ""the line"" for me.  But as far as watching a Blogger or an actor because he or she is attractive, even if it's not relevant to your other interests, that's not really creepy. I mean, if the most gorgeous man in the world started a blog on motorcycle repair, and he was funny and witty and shirtless, guess what? I'd possibly learn a little more about how a carburetor works!  Now, if I were to subscribe to his channel, and send him flirty emails and such as that, while in a committed relationship - that is passing a line.  I think that you can, and should, be able to appreciate the beauty of the human physical form. Come on, we squee over cute kittens and ooh and ahh over gorgeous leopards. Why not humans?  As an example, I watched my husband run in the Boston Marathon. I stood by that finish and watched all the elites come in. Myself and other female spectators were commenting appreciatively on the bodies of several of the male and female racers. Was that objectification? It's not like we were ogling over naked bodies in centerfolds. We were watching people who had trained their bodies like machines, and appreciating what the human form can be and how it can look and function.  But after all of that, the only runner who made my pulse quicken and who put a huge grin on my face and made me bounce up and down excitedly when he ran by, was my husband."

He was a bit extreme though like watching her I'm a Slave for You video on loop for 2 hours.

AskTrollX,35dwrf,octopushug,2,Sat May 9 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's fine. Men and women have their favorite porn stars or celebrity crushes. Some people watch TV shows or movies they wouldn't normally see based on the cast. Others follow bloggers or might be more likely to follow the escapades of someone based on their attractiveness. I'm of the opinion that attraction is natural and it is only a problem if the other party acts on it or it affects the relationship negatively (e.g. someone prefers masturbating to porn while ignoring their partner, someone is hurtful and compares their SO with someone else they find attractive, someone spends more time with their hot friend vs. their partner, etc.).  However, what might be OK for one person doesn't mean it has to be OK for someone else. If you are personally very bothered by it, you should definitely discuss it with your boyfriend to get his perspective on the matter. Just like some women aren't ok with their boyfriends even watching porn, and some men aren't ok with their girlfriends admitting they admire some dude's physique, it is really up to each person's boundaries in a relationship. Hopefully the individuals in a relationship will reach an agreement or understanding based on their own boundaries."

AskTrollX,35dg8t,Scarlett_ptista,5,Sat May 9 06:33:10 2015 UTC,"Long story short: We are in the top of a duplex.  New neighbors are awful, up all night and day screaming at each other (srs 2:30 am -6:00 am!), they smoke cigarettes in the house (a no no) which leaks into our vents and abuse there animals (we suspect). They have littered our shared front & back yard with JUNK and my SO and I are barely sleeping.   I brought this up to my landlord, who basically said ""hell no"" and called them. She said they seem sincere and apologetic, and we have spoken to them personally, too. My landlord will evict them if they don't stop -- and they haven't.   I've spoken to my neighbor in person and the woman seems nice, but they are ""hard"" people who obviously have addiction issues and usually seem to be on something. My so and I are apprehensive to approach them, as the man seems like he could be aggressive, and he's also just a big guy.   Since my landlord and I talked to them, it's been better, aside from the dog barking but then today,  I just heard them stomping on the dogs after an hour of barking. There was a horrific whimpering, and now silence. I started crying because it was so awful and I the dogs are dead. I don't want to move, but I don't want to be around these people. :/  I'm also concerned how to deal with them if they do get evicted, since that's a long legal process and I'm sure they will blame us.   Edit: I want to add that my main concern was the dog barking/abuse. It makes me sick, and my SO hates them for it. I want to have a reasonable relationship with seemingly otherwise fine neighbors, but this is really disconcerting. I'm trying to be reasonable about the noise levels overall, because I'm sure we can be loud, as well. Mostly the tv, or friends talking."
AskTrollX,35dg8t,SammaSunshine,7,Sat May 9 06:37:57 2015 UTC,"I would talk to your landlord again. I would specifically talk to the landlord about the treatment of the animals.

Your situation really sucks and I'm sorry you're in it.   I had shitty neighbors and calling our landlord and the cops really didn't help me but my landlord was a management company that didn't give a shit, and my neighbor used to sweet talk the cops until the cops left.

As for the dogs, call the SPCA or whatever animal protection service you have in your area, now. They will send some one to investigate based on what you've said here. Some times legally - depending on where you live - it can be a long process to have an animal removed, so it's best to report them every single time you hear something.

Please be aware of something- when you call the police or animal control or whoever on your neighbors, you can't go back. They're most likely going to know who called them, and it will change things. You could end up with people who are actively hostile towards you living directly below you, and you don't know how long they're going to be staying. So, do what you need to do, but take precautions.

He ended up feeling the same way, and we decided to date - still are, three years later.   I think it's a good idea to sort of prepare yourself for the chance that he might not feel the same way, but it's not the end of the world if he doesn't. It's better to say something than not.

His mother is by far the worst of them and told me I wasn't allowed to go to his graduation from basic training which was a huge deal. She also got in a huge fight with my mother because when I asked NICELY if we could all just get along for the ceremony she basically called me a stupid whore and completely went off on me so my mom went all momma bear on her. So it's been fun so far especially since he and I both still live with our parents.  So now! He posted a funny status on Facebook that's obviously fake about how solar panels cause parkinson's in children as a joke on the vaccines cause autism thing. I commented ""uhh duh"" (also joking) and his sister mocked me and the rest of his family basically tore him apart for it. They all treat each other like shit but like to team up against me and my family. I just can't take it anymore. Worst of all he's going on a deployment in a few months that will last for 6 months so they're making seeing him as much as possible before he leaves a living hell.

Important: how does your BF deal with it? I understand that if he lives with them he can't cut them out of his life, but he should definitely stand with you, if it comes down to it.

But if you're like me and soothing, interesting voices etc. always calm you down (I used to fall asleep in school when we'd have substitute teachers because listening to a new voice drone on and on would relax me so much), it is great. Most of them you don't need to watch what's happening anyway so you can have it on in the background while you work pretty easily. Bonus if you actually respond to ASMR and get the chills and ""tingles"" from sound.  Other than that, I will quadruple meditation and journaling. Sometimes having ""conversations"" with myself through writing helps me figure out my real feelings and calm down immensely. Try actually addressing yourself while you write and keep it pretty stream of conscious. I usually start off really mean and critical because I'm ANGRY at being angry but by the end am telling myself how much I love myself. I know thats kind of hippie so it's not for everyone, but it works well for me.  Goodluck, OP! Stress is the worst."

Sounds cheesy as hell, but they help me. Calm people, telling you calm things. Going outside. Go for a 5 minute walk around the building where you work, or longer if you're in a position where you can take a longer break. Masturbate (this might not be work appropriate, but hey, that's up to you) Write stuff down. If you're mad or frustrated, write all your feelings down on your computer or a piece of paper.

AskTrollX,35blhl,lilbluehair,7,Fri May 8 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Are you wearing gloves? If not, you might consider them. For now, I'd suggest moisturizing the heck out of them.   If it's ache in your hands and not from skin irritation, I suggest soaking them in warm water and massaging your hands with a good lotion. It could be the muscles in your hands aren't used to doing what you're demanding of them and they could be feeling the burn too.  Neither I nor my hubby wear gloves, but I've got callouses on my hands already from gardening and sculpting. I try to stay moisturized and will occasionally use a pumice stone on the roughest bits to keep them in line. But that is all personal preference.  Please PLEASE remember if any pain from a new exercise program is more than the burn your muscles feel around 36 hours post workout, please talk to a medical professional and re-evaluate whatever new exercise/lifting form you've added. Staying injury-free is highly recommended.  Lastly, good luck on your fitness journey, whatever the reason you're making it. You rock!   p.s.

AskTrollX,35blhl,eaten_by_the_grue,1 point,Fri May 8 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"On fire? Umm... my hubby and I were like o.O reading that description. Everyone has a different tolerance for exercise when they start out. But 'on fire' doesn't sound right to either of us.  Personally I would decrease your weight on deadlift if possible and try to focus on form. Many, many people do deadlifts wrong and hurt themselves. You might also check in with /r/weightroom,  /r/Fitness, or /r/xxfitness and see if there are some links to good forms videos to watch. If you do that, I recommend two other things, 1) mention the 'on fire' bit to them and see what they say. I'm betting you'll get some of what I've already mentioned. 2) Have a friend take a video of your lifting form so you can compare it to videos of good form. It will help you fix form issues. Good form = fewer injuries.   Also for S's and G's, you might want to check out this AMA from Becky Rich. She's fucking awesome. And if you want to see every man you know feel both emasculated and elated simultaneously, look up her lift videos on youtube."

AskTrollX,357wz6,marvelousmad,34,Thu May 7 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"I would go back to the salon and have either another stylist or the manager try to fix it. They can often reshape things, add more layers, or clean up ends/lines without removing length. And it's free. They want you to be happy with your cut and style so that you'll come back and tell other people to visit their salon. Just let them know what happened and that you want to come back in to have it fixed.  I just had this very same dilemma about a month ago. She styled it so that I couldn't tell it wasn't what I had asked for but when I washed and styled it (my way) the next day, I could tell it was wrong. So I called the salon and spoke to a manager about my experience and made a new appointment with another, more seasoned stylist. The new lady gave me a beautiful style with the shape and layers I had asked for while not removing any more of the length. It didn't cost anything to have them fix it, though I did give the new stylist a big tip for giving me a great style that I wanted and for having a great, helpful attitude despite the situation."
AskTrollX,357wz6,Rand0mSynth3sis,15,Thu May 7 23:28:35 2015 UTC,Can you go back and ask for her to fix it? What about wearing cute headbands/hairclips/putting your hair up? I wouldn't be too worried about graduation since you'll probably be wearing your cap the whole time. My college graduation was outside in the sweltering heat. We were all sweaty and dying from how hot it was in our black robes and caps. My hair was plastered to my head and neck. Not a very flattering look.
AskTrollX,357wz6,KindOwl,13,Thu May 7 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"I worked as a receptionist in a salon for about two years. I definitely agree that you should go back, especially since your graduation is coming up. They'll certainly fix it for free. I'd just add to be courteous when you make this request (it's amazing how assuming people can be). Be sure to explain that you didn't realize what bothered you until you left, and be as specific as possible about what you didn't like. They may try to keep you with the same stylist in order to build continuity and clients for that stylist. If you ask, however, they will give you another stylist. Whether you stay with that one or switch to another is completely up to you, it just depends on if you think the stylist was no good or if it was just a communication error.   And congratulations on graduating! I hope this helped a bit and that you walk across that stage feeling as fabulous as you are!"

And in 15 years, when you and your friends get together again for your reunion, you laugh your ass off as you recall the ""awful haircut"" you got right before graduation.  Because you are not a haircut. Because while you may be dissatisfied with how you look, you are still the smart as all hell, fierce as fuck, bad bitch you always will be."

I have also trimmed a tiny snip off my ends which helped my hair look less haggard.   However, this won't help you much in only a week. You should go back and ask them to style it for you for your grad. Perhaps a nice up-do or a loose curl?   Best of luck <3"

AskTrollX,356yn8,TurquoiseOrange,3,Fri May 8 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds fantastic, and it is. There are complications with it in terms of it happening in North America. Canada's a great example of this. The reason it works in European countries is society is used to/okay/understands coalition governments. This has never been a thing needed in the US because of there being only 2 main parties. Canada's a little different, we've got 3 main parties (Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrat Party) that are across Canada. One that is growing and now has 2 seats (Green Party), and the dying (now with only 2 seats) Bloc Quebecois.  The ""problem"" you run into with more parties is you are much less likely to have a majority government, which is fine as long as you get a coalition going and can still have a semblance of what a majority of the voters voted for. However that doesn't happen in Canada, and then we end up with fucking conservatives saying in minority liberal governments that it's a minority and it's not what the people want, ruling like they have a majority when they have a minority, and running full fucking amok when they have a majority. And when they had the minority BROKE laws to get government prorogued (suspended) to sabotage the fact that the other two parties looked like they were going to go the coalition route to get them out of power so that they could wait for it to self destruct (...which it did).  Anyways. I wish both countries were more like the European countries that have multiple parties and coalition governments. It's slightly complicated though apparently, and our conversatives are a much lighter version of your republicans so I can just imagine the stink the republicans would put up if it happened.  .....  Sorry for the rant. It um. Yeah.."

I feel like I surrounded myself in a green/labour Brighton and Facebook bubble where everyone is happy and left. I think it's because I've been doing friend culls, and by removing the people who I don't talk to and never really got on with from my very safe conservative hometown, I have there therefore been removing all of the conservative/ukip idiots."

AskTrollX,356yn8,tashlar,5,Thu May 7 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"Voted Green in a safe Labour seat. This result is super depressing. Campaigns in the press owned by Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere (right and centre right, including The Sun which helped to win Tony Blair the election in 1997) have really vilified Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, over the last few weeks so it's not actually that surprising that it was a total washout for him."

AskTrollX,35885y,Lanilegend,3,Fri May 8 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"I'd just skip the sarcasm and be honest that it makes you uncomfortable. If they continue, simply remove yourself from the situation. They are on cloud nine right now and likely won't take it seriously if you present your discomfort in a way that could potentially be taken as a joke. New relationships tend to make people euphoric and they can sometimes forget that the rest of the world doesn't share their bliss. It certainly doesn't mean you aren't happy for them or that they shouldn't be respectful of others, but it's common for them to misinterpret people's feelings as jealousy or unwillingness to celebrate their happiness. To avoid this, I would be careful not to be overly critical. Instead, try something like, ""hey guys, I'm really happy for you both, but the constant PDA makes me very uncomfortable. If you want to be alone, we can chill another time."""
