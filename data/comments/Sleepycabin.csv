Sleepycabin,3dto6d,RatPatriotNG,6,Sun Jul 19 10:20:27 2015 UTC,i don't think they do their podcast anymore. But josh and dom have one called fantasy fiction which is really funny
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,DeepBrown13,4,Sun Jul 19 11:10:40 2015 UTC,"Nick and Satch do a movie one, I believe. There's also some upcoming successor to ContinueCast."
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,TaylorCulosis,2,Sun Jul 19 12:17:53 2015 UTC,Nick and Satch's podcast is pretty cool. They review movies. Cinephilia Anonymous
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,HCroaks,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:57 2015 UTC,Paul does one with Dom and Chad about Goosebump books. That one has an episode out about once a month or so. Those ones are good for a sorta nostalgic feel of le 90's.
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,longrodvonhuttendong,2,Sun Jul 19 19:54:27 2015 UTC,"ah yeah, it is really funny though"
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,DeepBrown13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"They USED to have their own podcast. They stopped working on it over a year ago. They currently work on like... three different niche podcasts. Each one usually doesn't include all the members of the show. Instead, they feature friends from the 5x5 YouTube channel, or from Normal Boots.  I know this isn't the place to get on my soapbox, but once their Smart Guys project is released I think I'm done with them. They're all over the place, and it's really hard to stay invested in a group that doesn't keep up or stay fresh. Its become pretty stagnant. To be fair, their personal lives have become pretty complex having kids and whatnot so I can't be too harsh. At the same time, I can't help but feel somewhat betrayed. If Sleepy Cabin has them on I'll certainly listen, but I'm not particularly looking forward to it."
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,Gigabithen,3,Sun Jul 19 23:51:37 2015 UTC,"Smart guys hasnt been release yet? i remember they teased that like 2 years ago, and well i cant really see how you can ""feel"" betrayed, you probably just grow out of their content wich is totally fine and it just happens, is not like they changed their style or type of humour, i dont watch alot of letsplays but i do enjoy their videos, they really put some effort on editing the comedy bits and all"
Sleepycabin,3dto6d,PrimusSucks13,3,Mon Jul 20 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but it's not their fault.  Ever since continue has started they've always had less subscribers and fans than they deserves. Everyone at Continue works their asses off, even though they know they're not going to make anywhere near something a larger name, or even midsize youtuber will make. But they continue to stick to a regular upload schedule, be fucking hilarious, and run a bunch of different shit all the time. I mean, you can't possibly feel betrayed because they're juggling their regular lives with all the cool new shit they're trying out.  Maybe it's just me, but new experimental shit, even if it only lasts like, a month is always cool. It's just great knowing that these dudes can think and execute ideas while still having, yakno, kids."

In his late 40's maybe. His super powers were taken away from him by evil forces, and a large part of his brain went with it. He went into an almost vegetative state, and now talks with a keyboard and voice simulator similar to Stephen Hawking. He was hired by the SleepyKrew to narrate out of pity, after they found him on the streets of Philly.

Sleepycabin,3dqx0x,eureka60,0,Sun Jul 19 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get downvoted for this but whatever, you say that money from Patreon goes towards upkeep of the studio, but on their Patreon they specifically stated 'we'll be able to focus primarily on better, more regularly released content'. I looked around and found that the Patreon was made in October, which is nine months ago, so in the space of nine months the only content we have received was podcasts."
Sleepycabin,3dqx0x,mardfet,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"The majority of the SleepyCabin crew animates their cartoons with standard frame by framing on twos at 24FPS (12FPS) and the members that fail to meet that standard typically manage to apply the same deal of effort to their work in another fashion. Their cartoons have an average duration of roughly 2 minutes and they invariably account for their own pre and post production assets as well (voice work, music, backgrounds etc.) so let's do some hasty math to hazard a guess as to how long it would take for them to make one of their cartoons.   They're all fairly apt in their drawing abilities, so I'd imagine it takes them about 20 minutes to draw each individual frame (from rough to clean up); the only exception that comes to mind being Stamper who likely takes about an hour or two for each frame considering that he details everything to kingdom come (though, he resorts to more tweens and economic choices animation wise, so I'd imagine it's roughly the same for him). None of their cartoons involve consistent frames in succession (frame by framing until the end of the cartoon without any still frames) and pauses in each usually last about 2-5 seconds with roughly 15 instances of them occurring in each cartoon (possibly less in Cory's case, though I'm not approximating here).   So for a 2 minute cartoon, the animation would take about 22 and a half consecutive days—(12 x 120 x 20) - (12 x 3.5 x 20) = 16,200 / 720 = 22.5—on the event that the member of the SleepyCabin crew responsible for the toon were to somehow avoid the imminent death by dehydration that would occur after 3 days as a result of working that constantly (or sleep deprivation after 12 days if they animated with an I.V. and it weren't for the fact that after a certain number of days your body forces you to sleep). Of course, this only applies to the character animation process; this doesn't incorporate the amount of time it takes to account for voices, audio mixing, music and backgrounds, which would inevitably result in the amount of time it would take to make a SleepyCabin cartoon being over a month on the event that the crew were robots. Though, since they're not robots and need to deal with all of the tribulations of human life just like everyone else (as well as extraneous projects like SleepyCast or the game Cory and Jeff are working on), I think that an entire year for a quality cartoon is fair. Being subsidized by patrons doesn't give them extra manpower.   TL;DR: Animation is hard; be patient."

Sleepycabin,3d9rsh,-CptMaximum-,17,Wed Jul 15 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"I listened to one of Rogan's podcasts and it kinda bored me, but maybe I need to listen to more of them. I have some recommendations myself though. First off I'd like to ask about InternetBox, I listened to it, and it just seemed kinda weird, and very ""quirky humor"", which I wasn't a fan of. Anyways, my recommendations.  Harmontown - I think they're pretty funny, but I haven't listended to much of them so I don't really have much to say either.  RadioLab - A very cool science podcast, definitly nothing comedy related, but the topic that they discuss never fail to interest me, it's pretty popular so most people who are into podcasts probably already know about it, but it's definitely great background noise if nothing else.   Super Best Friendcast - Two of the members were on the latest episode if you haven't already listended to it. If you're into videogames you'll like these guys. I'm not much into let's plays, so I don't really watch those, but they're great to listen to. If you liked the latest episode, then you'll like these guys in general.    Ten Minute Podcast - It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a ten minute podcast where they discuss god knows what. It's one of my favorites even if they're short, but they have a ton of episodes to make up for it. They have good humor in general and plus they have a Youtube channel as well, where they've been progressively uploading their casts.  The Flop House - Do you love movies? Do you love analyzing movies? Particularity bad movies? Well this is the perfect podcast. They watch a movie, and then pick it apart and review it. Really great for the humor that they give off and the analysis as well, especially if you're into film."

But he'll get guests who are scientists, authors, stuff like that on. And he'll basically just listen to them explaining stuff, or telling stories for the majority of the podcast.   The best one I'd reccomend is a recent one with (#668) with Jon Ronson. He's a British Journalist who did a lot of stuff, you can just look him up.

Some of you might have different opinions on Cracked as a website, but the podcast is broadly appealing, features a killer filler soundtrack, and is generally informative and interesting.

Not opposed to little produced segments like that, in fact I think it's a good idea, but improv is not their strength.

Sleepycabin,3d3frd,FailureAtLifelol,9,Mon Jul 13 05:24:01 2015 UTC,Draw all the time
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,Scroke,6,Mon Jul 13 06:02:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm not the most experienced drawer in the world, and someone will give you better suggestions but i'll throw in what I know. First off, stay on paper for a while so you can gain your own technique and then move onto tablet, if you draw on tablet then move to paper it's going to make things more difficult than the other way around. I'd start off with regular number two pencils and some drawing paper, the reason I don't reccoment drawing pencils because usually they're different pencils which have several different shades/thickness' to them, However if you want to get a cheap set, then it won't hurt, but I guess you can play devil's advocate and say that it's better to get to know how the different pencils are used and why, so whatever sounds better to you.   For body parts and figures, references. I'm dead serious and it sounds like such an obvious thing to do, but it's insane how much you can understand more by looking at something else, instead of just doing it till it looks right, but the body is not an easy thing to draw, especially when you throw in muscle figures. I say go to a cartoon and then try and replicate what you see in your own style, which is something you'll pick up by drawing more and more. Drawing poses is great, but I would personally work on a certain body part and than a pose, a certain body part, then another pose. That way you can slowly not only get better at the body in general, but also specfific body parts along the way. Don't get discouraged that your hands aren't looking right, that just means you have to draw MORE! Drawing doesn't come without practice, make sure to remember that if you ever feel like your not progressing. Which also reminds me, keep all of your work! That way you can look back and compare, wait about a week and see where you're at, then a month, you'll be surprised if you're drawing constantly.   For lines, well what I do is draw many small lines that'll figure into a bigger better line, if that makes much sense. For a better example, here's a visual exmaple. So pretty much don't just draw a line and expect it to be perfect.  If you really want to improve on drawing, keep a calander and draw atleast something EVERY DAY and mark that you drew on your calender. Even if it's just a smiley face, it'll atleast show that you did SOMETHING to improve your drawing. That way you'll feel encouraged to draw as the days pass by.   Anyways, that's all I can think of, drawings really fun, and as intimidating as it may seem, everyone has always had a starting point."
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,ZackNavySox27,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:33 2015 UTC,"okay so i've been drawing since i was a little baba boy, and i was very much a faggot (and still am!) just like you! The advice I can give from my 10+ or so years of drawing is this: Start off imitating the styles of people you admire. Do your best to replicate what you like so much about those artists and put it to paper. Always draw, don't not draw- go out and get a sketchbook or a small notebook to doodle in wherever you go. If you have something you want to draw, try to draw it. It's probably gonna look real uggo when you do it, but another great way to improve is to go back to your old drawings and redraw them after some time to help motivate you and track your artistic progress. When you draw, don't push the pencil hard to the fucking paper like a ton of other stupid motherfuckers do, lightly sketch it out before you actually do the lines so that if you fuck up, you'll be able to erase what you fucked up on without leaving behind that gross faded dark line on the paper that looks like a lead ghost.  Sketching is an important component to drawing: never draw something you want to draw in a non-casual manner without sketching out how you want to draw it. You don't need a tablet yet, you silly goose. Keep the computer-focused drawing until you can actually draw well, because an investment like that is going to be useless and a waste of money for at least a few years. /r/sketchdaily is a subreddit where a new drawing idea is posted every day, and that could help you improve, with the regular drawing recommendation stuff and whatever. I draw okay, and I don't mean to shill my stupid shit, but here's my Art Blog, if you're interested: http://josieokami.tumblr.com/ (I'm not a frickin' art master)"
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,Lapsehannigan,2,Mon Jul 13 08:25:54 2015 UTC,"I've got to be honest, I really don't feel that copying someone else's style when you're getting started is a good way to go. A lot of people who want to draw attempt to copy an easier, cartoony, maybe even ""anime"" style, because they perceive it as taking less skill to draw. But learning things such as perspective, shading, anatomy, etc in a stylized manner first can really mess up how you think about how drawing works.  I'm not saying these styles are bad, or that they're not 'as good' as other styles, but it's something you should tackle after you have at least a basic understanding of life drawing illustration rules, such as perspective, basic anatomy, etc.  I do, however, agree to be light with a pencil. But always be confident with your final line work, or you'll be stuck with broken, ""hairy"" lines. I find that learning to use your elbow any whole arm for lines is a really important skill to learn for getting clean line work. And I would suggest as well to keep away from the tablet until you have confidence in your art traditionally. Many people get frustrated with tablets when they start out drawing, and give up altogether.   Sorry for the big rebuttal, but you do have a lot of good tips that I feel would be helpful to a beginner."
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,TARDIS-Engineer,2,Tue Jul 14 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"Love you for writing this. No one really addresses the most important fact about starting out as an artist or anything creative - the mentality. It is going to be extremely hard to motivate yourself to pick up the pencil every day and do a sketch, since people/stuff get in the way. The techniques and all the skill will come, it is not as important as finding stimulus - I have seen so many people giving me lecturer on how they’ll become the greatest thing ever and just give up a week later. So that is the place to start - why do you want this?  Is it because of animation? Do you want to tell stories? Do you want to transfer your fantasies into reality? Basically capture the feeling you first felt when starting out and never forget it. Remind yourself every day. In a way, it seems self-explanatory, but it is so easy to be discouraged by failure or people not holding the same interest as you. You need to look ahead, imagine where you’ll be if you work hard enough.  Never stagnate. It always amuses to see people say they have found their style and continue to draw everything in a certain way. Always try new things - never allow a previous drawing be like the next. Experiment, try copying other artist's creations, try manipulating imagery, e.g.; painting over a female picture to create a male character; instead of creating a sketch with a pen do a collage for a sketch.  Go digital. Traditional media has become too inconvenient to work with and learn from - buying a small, cheap tablet is going to be enough for several years and immensely speed up your learning curve. Even further, put all your work online and request critique - even if it hurts, they are right. People who deny any criticism are idiots who will never change what they do and rarely achieve great things.  Also, lines are a fucking bummer, even after a long time I always get frustrated when drawing those fuckers. The usual way beginners draw lines are with several strokes in a certain direction; however, it should go from point A to point B without stopping (to do that you use the whole elbow, etc.). But I found out that doing crappy lineart in up-scale (8,000px) and then doubling down (4,000px) is just as good as trying to get the flawless lines. Some lines just can’t freaking be done with hand and look decent, so you’ll have to use anchor points (PS) to draw them.  I know you expect one of the guys to answer, but I hope this helps."
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,ron-salcewicz,2,Mon Jul 13 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"This question has been answered before, but I'll let you know what worked for me.  Begin on paper and then move into digital.  Ask yourself this;  Are you into more realistic stuff or cartoons?  Do you want to make general (funny/dark/etc) animations?  If it's animation, find your style; draw people with small eyes, big eyes, round faces, small limbs, buff, a mix of everything, etc and see what you feel comfortable with.  For example, Zach's depiction of himself has long limbs and a big face with small features, while Oney has a mixture of both in his Leo & Satan stuff.    For more realistic work, start with Proko's videos:  http://tinyurl.com/np6r2pq  For more  cartoon like features, read, The Animator's Survival Kit:  https://safelinking.net/qZ4Riik  CLICK HERE: http://tinyurl.com/npgbcmk  PASS: coryisabitch     How to have lines that don't look like shit?

Sleepycabin,3d3frd,KerotanSam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"My advice as an amateur animator is accept that your first things aren't going to turn out 100% perfect. If you're starting out, you should just try everything (standalone drawings, cartoons, animatics) and see what comes easiest for you. If you don't want shit lines, don't rush yourself trying to be instantly good at free hand and take your time with it. Also, maybe brush up on a few tutorials (Cory and Harry Partridge have VERY helpful tutorial series). Thems my 2 cents, hope you stick with it. Drawing is a great way to be productive when you have too much free time."
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,dano_xmas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:05:40 2015 UTC,drawing is like cooking but not really. Sometimes the best experience is just to grab a pencil & paper and experiment. Sometimes I'll draw a weird curvy line and try and make something out of it.
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,Crunchy7233,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what the best place to start is but you should definitely check out channels like Sycra and Jetty Jet. I'd also recommend checking out PDFs of books by Andrew Loomis. There are other professional artists that have books out there but a lot of people swear by Loomis. There are plenty of tumblr blogs with good references and informational material and websites like Pixelovely and Quickposes are good to start doing things like gesture drawings.  Why do you draw shit lines? Mileage. Just keep drawing and they'll get better. If they're that bad you can just practice drawing lines over and over with varying thicknesses. I don't do that because I think it's fucking boring. That's probably why my lines suck  Why are you a faggot? Cause you love the cock  Should you use a tablet? Doesn't really matter in my opinion. Some people say it's better to start with pencil and paper. They probably know better than me  Godspeed faggot, I too am on the journey to not draw like shit. I'll see you on the other side"
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,nrutas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"This may not be the most helpful because when I started doing it I had a decent amount of drawing experience, but I think fan art is a pretty good place to start. I thinks its good because it gives you real people to base your drawings off of (Converting a real person into a cartoon character seems easier to me than creating an original one). Having said that I'd say make sure that you look to a number of different places: watch tutorials, look at other people's artwork, check out things like Chris's art streams. You can learn a lot about shading techniques and the like from just looking at other artists. Anatomy is trickier. I've found it to be a process of me drawing a person, thinking it looks shit, checking other artists work, looking for rules that apply to the human body, e.g. men are basically just boxes, then carrying on from there. I'm nowhere near at the level as say Sabrina but you may find this helps a bit."
Sleepycabin,3d3frd,AkronymCLT,0,Mon Jul 13 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"Have you considered a different art form than ""drawing""?  Drawing is pretty ambiguous and can take a life time to get good at (and you want to be good at it in order to enjoy it). It's not like going to the gym where you'll see results within 2 years. I suggest picking up a guitar or a different kind of instrument. It'll be a better introduction for an outsider into the art scene. It's a thing where you can focus on technique first and then on feeling it. After you're in touch with your inner art, you can progress to things that require more feeling it."

OP talked about drawing fruit and shit, if that's all he can think of to draw, he's gonna be drawing fruit and shit forever.  Hipster or not, vagina or not. Drawing is about putting something you have in your head on paper. It's trying to express yourself in a way you feel comfterable. That's what art has always been about.

Sleepycabin,3d3frd,soupcat,2,Tue Jul 14 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"That's OP's main problem.  You can yell like Shia or recite the Nikes' motto (Just Do It) all you like, but it won't help every single person out there.  I understand OP's position, when starting out some  of us need structure/shedule and variant 'visual' techniques to help us along the way.  That's like me telling you to just grab a guitar and pull on the strings and hope your a natural.  Even musicians need a place to start.  From experience, learning an instrument is much more difficult than art.  It requires way more patience, I feel he would just get stressed out.

Sleepycabin,3cyxjm,chuma93,0,Sun Jul 12 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time enjoying the book honestly, Werther and Lotte bored me; reminded me of Pamela. Maybe its better written in German but the translations I have don't live up to 'beautiful'."
Sleepycabin,3cyxjm,Hloy,4,Sun Jul 12 04:19:09 2015 UTC,"I've read the book in German years ago for class. The book and the story itself is kinda boring for today's standards and the way they spoke German back then makes it a hard read, even for a native speaker.  But if you learn about in which time Goethe lived and how this books indirectly talks about the society back then it makes it all more interesting. Also the character of Werther is timeless in his emotions and behavior: A heartbroken whiny prick. If I recall correctly, Goethe was one of the first to write a character in that way.  TLDR of the story and why it is timeless:   Werther is a nature hipster with rich parents (you know, a lovable character to begin with /s). He sits in forest all day and loves the shit out of it. Then he meets Lotte. Long story short, he wants to put his dick in her. Problem is: Lotte is already engaged with a guy named Albert. A damn swell guy and he is also a doctor (son-in-law boner material right there). Even Werther likes him. Society in that time would be extremely outraged if you would bang the fiance of another man (religion blah blah). Although Lotte seems to get little wet herself when she meets Werther, she friend-zoned him for live. Werther is fucking mad about this shit, even tries to live elsewhere. This is an important part of the book. At first you would think, why the fuck would it matter that he goes somewhere else before he goes back to kill himself in the end anyway? This part of the book shows, how Werther could be a fine citizen, because it is shown, that he is good worker and loved guy around there. If I recall correctly he is even interested in another bitch down there, but for him it is not about fucking girls anymore, it is about fucking society itself. So he goes back to Lotte and is all melodramatic about all this, kisses her and then shoots himself later.   Fun fact: After he shot himself, it took 4 hours before he finally died. Remember kids, shoot through your mouth. Don't hold your pistol to your head.  What the makes this is masterpiece in my opinion is the fact, that could endlessly argue about if his suicide was justifiable. One could say he was an idiot and a narcissist and kill himself over nothing, also for religious people suicide is a sin. On the other hand you have a guy that just followed his emotions and didn't give a fuck about society and its rules.  Also the book itself is rather short and most of the text reveals important stuff about Werther but sometimes in very subtle way. Remember when we talked about how Werther loves nature? After he realizes that he is cock-blocked, he begins to see the bad sides of nature and how it revolves around death and destruction.  We learn that his perception of the world is bound to his own emotions and this could also be a hint that he is a very egocentric character. IMHO a good book/story is free of filler content and is subtle about its message."

Sleepycabin,3cvvpf,Kainraa,10,Sat Jul 11 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much on the same wavelength as these guys with eating meat or consuming products from animals.  While I agree that animals that are purely for livestock purposes should get better treatment when it comes to their farming process, I can't see myself not eating meat or consuming other animal based products anytime soon.  And people who constantly think that these animals should get the same treatment as human beings are fooling themselves and just try to fucking guilt trip you. I'm sick of it.  You don't want to eat meat, that's fine. But don't force your own morals on me or anyone else. Especially children."

Sleepycabin,3cvjvb,watermanx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:07:36 2015 UTC,"I really like the remake. Especially the cinematography in it and Jane Levy's performance. Sam wanted a new take on the original film for quite a long time; so they found a guy to do it. Well as for the TV show, Sam Raimi is only directing the first episode and writing it with his brother Ted (who co-wrote the original Evil Dead films). Sam will stay on as a main producer and sort of a creative consultant for the rest of the episodes. As well as the king himself besides just starring in it. They have a separate show-runner for this series. If it's successful and leads to a season 2, he may write and direct more episodes. The trailer was badass and seems like alot of fun."
Sleepycabin,3cvjvb,WLLMWM-phil,0,Sat Jul 11 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the remake was very forgettable and didn't capture anything that made the originals likeable. People seem to really think this mini series is going to be good, but this trailer made me groan. I wish some good things could just be left alone. Just because it has Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell doesn't mean it is going to be good. If they just reference the other movies and make jokes about Bruce Campbell being out of shape and old it will be shit. I actually haven't seen a sleepycast where they talked about this though?

Sleepycabin,3cvyp1,legonro,4,Sun Jul 12 20:01:35 2015 UTC,It was discussed here in the reddit a couple weeks ago. A lost episode is basically a cut part from a past podcast or it can be a podcast involving who ever is available atm and usually revolve around on certain topic.  Main Podcasts involve more of the gang and they talk about about more than one topic and answer questions given by fans.

This isn't Facebook, they won't do anything maddening that'll have your hands up in the air. These are all dudes we admire who, if they stay true to themselves (cheesy I know but deal), we'll continue to admire.  The alternative is quite literally consuming from a frame of comfort and stability. Fuck that noise!  Goes for any show really, do you want to get what you expect or be given something you didn't know you wanted? Sleepycabin from the beginning is exactly that. There's potential risk in moving forward and evolving/changing,  but I guarantee when it works -and trust that it will- the latter is much more satisfying."

Sleepycabin,3csstz,ikenjake,21,Fri Jul 10 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"Oh. For some reason when you said isolate I thought you meant you took out the music (which you would do by finding the music by itself, synching the music up with the music in the podcast, invert the waveform of your isolated music track causing it to cancel out in the recording leaving nothing but their voices and I know that sounds made up but I will copy paste the following from here)    Open Audacity and Import both the regular and instrumental tracks. Select one of the tracks and use the Time Shift tool to roughly align the two tracks. Zoom in really close and then zoom in more. Exact alignment is critical. Pick a peak or trough in the left channel of one track and match it precisely with the left channel of the other track. If the alignment isn’t right the process won’t work. Select the instrumental track, and invert it using Effect > Invert. Use CTRL + A to select all of both tracks. Use Tracks > Mix and Render.    Am I just weird or did anyone else think that?  *edit:formatting"

Sleepycabin,3cregl,FreakaJebus,9,Fri Jul 10 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"Somebody once said, “nothing you say before the word ‘but’ matters”, so I’m just gonna cut straight to the chase.   The main issue, as people mentioned before, is the camera movement. It feels stiff, because when Mick ends a sentence you then transition to the next object and then just stop; I would suggest to have a faster transition from object to object (blurring between), and then have a slower movement on the actual object - when we’re looking at it - just as you did with the forest scene. Suggest to use Adobe After Effects for that, although, a normal editor, like Sony Vegas, can accomplish something similar. However, a better version would be just to have the camera panning (from left to right) through the forest, and maybe we see some pixel versions of the guys fighting monsters or just running towards the cabin - Cory, for example, tripping on a rock on the way there, and everyone running past him, except Chris, who helps him up - that would give a glimpse on the podcast and create some character.   On that note, I think, it feels primitive - Mick talks about a forest, the video shows us a forest; he talks about the world, you show us an empty sky. There can be shown much more interesting stuff related to that idea, try interpreting what is said; so, for example, for the beginning, “There is a world as tangible as our own...” - it doesn’t necessarily mean you have to show us a planet or the sky - the screen can be filled with a bathroom scene (a world) and the guys acting as germs or turds in the toilet. “... impossible to see, yet unavoidable to sense...” - just as the smell of a turd! I love when people run wild with their imagination - now you’re just doing a pixel rendition of the original intro.   Respect from my side for having the balls to ask for criticism."
Sleepycabin,3cregl,ron-salcewicz,2,Fri Jul 10 09:07:14 2015 UTC,"Wow. Wasn't expecting anybody to write whole paragraphs, so that's great, thanks! I take issues with the panning and zooming as well, so I'll look into after effects. I was going for a Mega man game intro style which is why it's so primitive, but I definitely understand what you mean, and intend to make some changes in that sense."
Sleepycabin,3cregl,Scroke,3,Fri Jul 10 11:52:49 2015 UTC,"It looks great, the cabin is more like a big ass mansion though because of the perspective. (Trees and shit.) Might feel better if the camera was moving along to the voice better and had something to spice up the movements."
Sleepycabin,3cregl,someone_unkown,3,Fri Jul 10 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"This looks cool... but what is it exactly? I'm a bit tired at the moment, so sorry if it's obvious what it is."
Sleepycabin,3cregl,fancy_quilts,2,Fri Jul 10 07:23:13 2015 UTC,A preview for a project I'm working on in my spare time. I don't want to give away too much so that it's more of a surprise when it actually comes out.
Sleepycabin,3cregl,MeatManFunMan,3,Fri Jul 10 12:02:07 2015 UTC,"Before i say anything i'll just let you know i had a different take on what an pixelated intro would look like. I would have made the transitions different, and used different colors. My ideas wouldnt be too original. What you would see is everything that were given from the guys them selves, the whole purple and orange color scheme, you'd see an owl, but that thing you did with the logo and moon was cool. Pixelated, and something a bit more dramatic with the transitions of what youre trying to show off, moon, woods, zoom into woods, close up on a owl, view lowers to show a cabin surrounded by tree's. Other than that nice job. Sorry if i have shit taste and i made you read it."
Sleepycabin,3cregl,rustoneal,5,Fri Jul 10 09:19:01 2015 UTC,"It looks good, but the movements need to be a bit more smoother, and the cabin needs to be more of a cabin and not a house (so smaller), but all around it is pretty good, oh and also maybe have the logo last a little bit longer. I couldn't make it out the first time."

Sleepycabin,3cregl,eureka60,2,Fri Jul 10 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"Love it, personally it could flow really well if you just had the camera on a slow movement the entire time, when it stops on the moon to flash the symbol it kinda breaks things up, can you pass the moon and flash the symbol at the same time? Plus if you make it this slow epic shot it'll be funny if when Mick goes ""a bunch of guys..."" And breaks the epicness make the camera jump to the cabin and shake a bit so it loses some ""epicness"" but whaddoiknowyakno"

Love some of the art styles, others look really 'indie' or 'artsy' which isn't my thing.  Thumblr:  http://latenightworkclub.tumblr.com/  One of my favorites, looks like it could work in a TV series or video game:  http://41.media.tumblr.com/99fa491f305f86eb4317ae0af17982b6/tumblr_n8ax7kUiAx1rgxc02o1_1280.jpg"

They are socially similar and aim to make people of the same nature laugh.  LNWC, again, seems more intimate and philosophical.  Most 'self implied indie work' is that way.  The subjects presented are usually not of a comedic nature, but may have unintentional comedic tones.  I love many of the art styles by LNWC, but, none of the animations speak to me.  I find them bizzare and somewhat intriguing, but lack a more loose narative.  When I say intimate, I'm not saying the Sleepy or Grump guys don't have depth to their work, it's just diffrent work altogether.  What the fuck did I just say?  ... Oh, yeah, um.  Oney or Zach can make a whole cartoon series for a TV channel, based on their art style and type of comedy alone, which appeals to many.  Their work can only be shared, be hyped or appreciated in their own corner.  Maybe, a big maybe, if their art is intersting enough a company might hire them for a video game.  All this because, to answer your question:  They are from diffrent worlds, both in the audience they make their work for (market to) and how personal it is.  Would really be intersted in watching these two groups talk.  Hopefully their work is not a marker for their sense of humor."

Telling someone you did a great job, when they clearly are doing an awful one, in my eyes, is doing much more harm than good. Anyone that does that is making the author delusional about their skill and capabilities - when he's going to face a real life scenario, for example, doing a drawing for a client, he'll be ripped apart and depressed more than ever.   It always astounds me that people are so naive and think that writing ""great job"" is going to help the artist (or anyone) develop.

Sleepycabin,3cin7z,GriefMachine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right that no one's really applauding him on the piece in the comments; however, do you really think that the artist isn't interpreting the up-votes as positive feedback? If you don't plainly state that you find the artwork crap, the individual might just think that the audience (all the down-votes) is not understanding the humor or just are trolls, or God knows what else (and vice versa - if you don't state that you like it, he might think everyone hates it).  Again... if I don't find the joke funny (or I don't find the message interesting, etc.), then it leaves me with just the drawing - he could just as good written it in plain text if he doesn't care about the execution. And I doubt that the author would upload a drawing which he thinks is bad; or draw anything if he thought the drawing part isn't essential for the piece to work; therefore, the ""interaction joke"" argument makes little sense to me.   ""I think, your defense of him should be saved for someone who's requesting it"" - you see what I did there? This is a pointless argument and can be switched around endlessly - the author didn't also say ""please no criticism"". Although, even if he had said it, it would engage me even more, like reverse psychology."

Sleepycabin,3cg52y,DXCharger,48,Wed Jul 8 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"The podcast didnt really even feel like lets play discussion either, so I don't even understand the complaints. It was just a couple outside the group dudes shooting shit and suckin dick for cadbury cream eggs with the Sleepy boyz, I loved it."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,-CptMaximum-,35,Tue Jul 7 17:56:50 2015 UTC,Who said that? I was extremely happy different people joined for a podcast. Hope you can get the other lads of sbfp for an hour or 2.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,TheBackfiringVirus,16,Tue Jul 7 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"If you check out the thread were Matt announced he would be on it, you'll find the hate there."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Zedyy,11,Tue Jul 7 19:21:59 2015 UTC,That's sad. I love those guys.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,TheBackfiringVirus,4,Tue Jul 7 19:30:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I never even heard of them before and I thought they were great guests
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,rocky716,6,Wed Jul 8 15:46:27 2015 UTC,He's not exaggerating  People were literally fucking complaining because they said Matt isn't too dark/harsh of a person. Jesus fucking Christ.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Ultimate_Cabooser,3,Wed Jul 8 04:08:38 2015 UTC,It would be cool if some of the sleepy cast guys did a spot on their podcast.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Nny7229,3,Sat Jul 11 07:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't think the SBFP podcast suits them. It's very much game oriented and I'm not sure they play very many games. I prefer the guests being on SleepyCabin as it is a very different conversation.  Although, I could be completely wrong, and I'd like to be proven wrong with a podcast."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,TheBackfiringVirus,2,Sat Jul 11 08:55:49 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you there. I think it would be interesting, but it might not fit. The SBFs had some guests before (and they did break their normal schedule), but those were all videogame related."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Nny7229,2,Sat Jul 11 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"But hey, if it gives them an excuse to make another podcast, I'd be happy haha."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,TheBackfiringVirus,69,Sat Jul 11 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"Matt and Wooly were great on the podcast, I'm not really familiar with their content but if their humor is like how it was on the podcast I'm going to have to check them out. That whole commercial bit had me losing it. Really hope there is a second episode with these guys someday."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,cheyas,13,Tue Jul 7 17:34:16 2015 UTC,Their original content and their playthroughs are great.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,totaled_cds,12,Tue Jul 7 22:20:32 2015 UTC,Their own podcast is exactly like how they were on sleepy cast. Super Best Friend Cast is one of two other podcasts I actually care to listen to. The other one being the Podquisition.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Namaztak,3,Wed Jul 8 00:20:33 2015 UTC,are we twins?
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,MomiziWolfie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"Apparently, at least in podcast taste."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Namaztak,4,Fri Jul 10 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"I'd never heard of them before the podcast but I thought they were great too. People need to get off their high horse and realise that they're just two funny dudes who are friends with SleepyCabin.  The fact that they do ""Lets Plays"" made no difference to the podcast, the same way the SleepyCabin guys could be completely shit animators and the podcast would still be funny and entertaining because they all great personalities and work well together."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,dDpNh,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:31 2015 UTC,I really enjoy the SBFP. They all have had experience with the games industry (mostly as testers) and have interesting insight to gaming news. Plus they are really funny.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Nny7229,17,Sat Jul 11 07:15:33 2015 UTC,"What? This podcast was fucking great. Bring them on again! Also, oney is a lets player..... Who cares? It's not like they brought on fucking pewdiepie and had him scream and yell for attention."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Scroke,15,Tue Jul 7 21:02:16 2015 UTC,"I watch their stuff regularly, I think the confusion people are having regarding lets players was Jeff's example of Let's players (markiplier namely) not being able to make their own content without someone else's game, SBFP on the otherhand make tons of their own content and usually talk about completely different subjects in their vids. Also they work (or have worked, idk about currently) as videogame testers so they actually have some interesting insights into a lot of games."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,SarcasticFitz,4,Tue Jul 7 18:47:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I think people complaining is a matter of not taking the let's players conversation with a grain of salt. Not all let's players are talentless hacks.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,CommanderZiltoid,3,Wed Jul 8 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"They aren't tryhards that scream at the tv, I think it helps that all for us of them have actually worked in game development as testers(?) so they actually have tons of insight."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,grangach,15,Wed Jul 8 10:01:29 2015 UTC,"I've never actually watched their content, but they seem like great fellas.   Just add a trigger warning if you get any grumpy guests."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Fiestu,21,Tue Jul 7 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"A let's play is a let's play regardless, commending Chris on his let's play videos while bitching about someone else's is hypocritical."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,das_vargas,4,Tue Jul 7 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"Speaking of guest, i believe you guys talked about having Jontron as a guest in a previous podcast. Is there any follow up on when we might see that episode?"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Ryan7074,3,Tue Jul 7 19:26:56 2015 UTC,I'll bet you a shiny new penny it'll be next podcast. I'm good for it.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ApacheMaster,12,Tue Jul 7 19:28:30 2015 UTC,"It disappoints me the that the Sleepycabin fan base is so petty and hive minded. A lot of the time issues like this never even hit my radar until I come to the subreddit. I can't believe that people would actually be upset with ""let's players"" being on the podcast. I don't even watch Super Best Friends, but it's easy to tell that there's a huge difference between the way they conduct themselves and the way some like Pewdipie does."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,DrFreekzilla,3,Wed Jul 8 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can say that about the ""Sleepycabin fan base"". Every fan base is gonna have sub divisions that feel a certain way towards shit. Especially with the variety of people in the group."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,DrFreekzilla,2,Wed Jul 8 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"But it seems like these kinds of discussions happen a lot. When you guys went on Cartoon Hangover a similar uproar happened. It seems like you guys have to come and calm people down about stuff way too often, and I just wish that wasn't the case."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,DrFreekzilla,4,Wed Jul 8 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"The displeased are generally the loudest, and it creates an overall image that is unbalanced and does not represent the whole. And honestly, if we're not ruffling some feathers here and there, we aren't doing our jobs to explore outside comfort zones."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,caninehere,4,Wed Jul 8 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. But in any case, it's good to see that you guys are willing to talk about these issues rather than dance around them/ignore them."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,SenorBrochacho,-3,Thu Jul 9 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"I think the problem was the cast of this episode to be honest. The SBFP guys were alright but I'm not really familiar with their work, and while I didn't want to listen to 2 hours of discussion on LPs, that's not what happened anyway.  But for many the appeal of this show is not about guests, it's about the guys and seeing them being real people making stuff. In this episode there were 5 people on the recording and Chris was clearly not feeling great so he hardly talked for most of the episode - so the podcast was pretty much 50% people that many of us don't know.  I'm not against guests but it's better when they feel like guests - this episode felt like Woolie and Matt were kind of running the show. And I don't blame them for that Or anything and I don't think they were trying to do so, it just happened that way.  Based on the number of podcasts I've listened to, I have to say that having more than one guest is USUALLY a bad idea, at least if they are going to be on the entire episode. I get that they're a pair but it usually just doesn't work, and if you throw five Sleepycabin guys in with two guests or something like that it just gets unwieldy.  I think that Matt and Woolie were good on the podcast even though I don't really have any desire to watch their LP stuff, but most podcasts have a strength in their familiarity factor and the number of guests featured on a program usually means the more guests the less personal things feel."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,sirmidor,3,Wed Jul 8 12:56:19 2015 UTC,"I love Matt and Woolie and I think this episode was well worth the wait. To me,it sounds like people are just being butthurt and wanna decide who is cool or who isn't. If you guys like the person then its all good. I didn't really like Shadman before he was on the Sleepycast due to his strange work but after he was I began to appreciate who he was and re-examine his work in another light. The dude has talent. I listen to the Sleepycast to keep up with you guys and find new talent to enjoy but thats just me. I'm already looking forward to the next episode."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,HuurrDuurr,3,Tue Jul 7 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"you spelled Woolie wrong there, Mick.    on topic, i was one of the people who thought you guys wouldn't mesh well and i was pleasantly proven wrong by a fun podcast. Maybe not on of those i keep coming back to every week because it keeps being fun to listen to, but still a good sleepycast episode."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,evangelism2,4,Tue Jul 7 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"autocorrect, edited."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,grangach,7,Tue Jul 7 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Making excuses here, Muck?"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,AndrewRyansRapture,9,Tue Jul 7 22:54:15 2015 UTC,lololo
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,GameBoy09,3,Wed Jul 8 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"I watch Let's Plays quite often, so I personally have no grudge against them.   However you guys have on the podcast before talked shit on LP'ers on at least one occasion, probably more. You cultivate a fan base based on your opinions. Don't be surprised that when you go against that rhetoric some of the listeners lash out."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ron-salcewicz,13,Tue Jul 7 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"That's not the opinion of all the whole group. Even Oney does let's plays , in fact JEFF (who's been very vehement about his disdain for certain let's players) has done let's play-y stuff. Even when Jeff was poking fun at Markiplier, Stamper mentioned that he was a nice enough guy. So yes, we make fun of certain let's players (generally their let's play personas), but that doesn't mean we can't think they're decent people... some of them. lol"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ApacheMaster,2,Wed Jul 8 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really get a persona vibe from the sbf, they seem like pretty consistent dudes, they don't scream at the tv or try to be lol random like the game grumps or pewdiepie. There's no hard and fast rule, some lets players bring their own honest personality and to the table, and others put on a clown mask and churn out hours and hours of the same shit every day."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ron-salcewicz,3,Wed Jul 8 10:09:34 2015 UTC,I was a fan of the Two Best Friends/SBFP long before I supported Sleepycabin so I find it funny somebody might dislike the combination.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,AkronymCLT,3,Tue Jul 7 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the people who didn't like the podcast is in the EXTREME minority. Like lesss than 15% minority.   That ""Attorney"" commercial was fucking GOLD!"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ron-salcewicz,11,Wed Jul 8 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"For one, I can understand the frustration that comes from some listeners - they subscribed to a portal about animation and art; therefore, they expect topics/guests close to that universe. The same way someone who reads a football magazine wouldn't want to get bombarded with NASA articles.   However, the latest podcast wasn't even so occupied with Let's Play talks... yes, there was a 10 minute section or so, but the rest was juicy/hilarious discussions about all kinds of things. Even if someone hated the guests, they gave a rich perspective on how they also understand that the ""art form"" they practice isn't something to rely on (like it was stressed in previous podcasts). View it as an opportunity to explore the Let's Players understanding about the subject - and to be honest, not everyone is a PewDiePie - there's plenty of bright, interesting people who upload similar content, like Yahtzee (Ben Croshaw).   Not all Arabs are terrorists; not all Chinesse know math; not all Let's Players are retarded, money sucking, internet polluting cunts."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Urist_McGamer,20,Tue Jul 7 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"Chinese people who say they don't know math are just fuckin' with you, dude. Open your round eyes!"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ron-salcewicz,30,Tue Jul 7 17:53:23 2015 UTC,this is fact
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Urist_McGamer,3,Tue Jul 7 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, man - thanks! I knew all Arabs are terrorists!"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,InfinityX1000,8,Tue Jul 7 21:16:33 2015 UTC,To be fair it's not like the podcast is generally particularly art focused anyway. Obviously they have those conversations because it's something they each know a lot about and they're all really interesting. But personally what I like best about SleeptCast is that the topics can range from art to life stories to which poptart is the best. That said I totally understood the people who weren't sure whether or not Matt and Woolie would mesh well. SuperBestFriendCast and SleepyCast are two different beasts after all.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Notsophamous,4,Tue Jul 7 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"Very true. The first thing that SleepyCast demonstrated to me was that Chris, Zach, Mick, Jeff, Stamper, Cory, Niall were also people - they also pay bills, they get depressed, and have all sorts of troubles. That sounds obvious in a way, yet when you are viewing one of their videos on YouTube, they seem God-like, unreachable, untouchable.  And that's, I guess, what this podcast is more about (the journey) rather than the art talk."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Nard_Puppy,7,Tue Jul 7 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, how often do they actually talk about animation? Like, once every 5 episodes? For 10 minutes? I listen to them because they're a bunch of cool guys, not for anything to do with animation or art."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,IBdeadshadow,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"Never really said absolutely everyone listens for that one reason - some might be here for the art talk, some for the brilliant humor, etc. - and you're right that they don't touch upon animation as often as I would imply. Yet that's not the point. I could just as easily said, ""Some listeners are frustrated, because they have to endure outsiders of the medium."" Which means that it is established that this is a multimedia studio (cartoons, movies, music); therefore, one would expect people from the same area to come in and tell about themselves. Imagine it as a place where people have a sort of enlightenment about the artists they follow - maybe you liked Sabtastic for her art, but wanted to know how she's really like as person - BOOM, a podcast. If you get someone who's contrary of anything really creative (in your eyes), then you'll get ""meh-y"" and lose interest.  I have an odd feeling you might think I disliked the guests or the idea of different people coming into the studio - no way - I'm just trying to argue about the fact where the disappointment might stem from for other listeners."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,SkippingCheeto,5,Tue Jul 7 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Dude, I get that. I think you just kinda got the wrong tone out of my comment."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,spencerxavier,2,Tue Jul 7 21:16:22 2015 UTC,Honestly I loved those guys. Right as I turned it on I thought two things. Why isn't zach on and why are there let's players? As it went on though I thoroughly enjoyed the whole podcast.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,spencerxavier,2,Tue Jul 7 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"I can't believe people actually complained because who the fuck cares as long as the guest(s) have actual personality and is funny. I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed ep29 of the podcast."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,norgamka,2,Wed Jul 8 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"Clearly they're funny guys, it was a fantastic episode, well worth the wait!"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,rippedstallion,2,Wed Jul 8 12:13:24 2015 UTC,As long as you guys keep making me laugh I don't care who is on.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ZackNavySox27,2,Wed Jul 8 13:02:19 2015 UTC,I was happy with the quality of the episode.  I'll be honest when I head it was those guys I was a bit hesitant but after a few minutes the guys fit right in. The infomercial slayed me. Another great podcast! Keep it up!
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Urist_McGamer,2,Wed Jul 8 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Was there really that big of a backlash? You technically already had a""Let's Player"" on your crew. Did they forget about OneyPlays?"

Sleepycabin,3cg52y,pvt_noob_face,2,Thu Jul 9 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Who thought this podcast was purely for animators and artists, there was nothing indicating that besides by chance the people they had on were usually artists."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Synikul,2,Sat Jul 11 05:16:39 2015 UTC,I'm not really a fan of Letplayers at all generally because there mostly boring and painfully unfunny i even can't watch GameGrumps even though i like Arin's animations and Ninja Sex Party but i didn't have a problem and they ended up being great guests and it helps they had there own podcast for experience which i'm gonna check out later because of this.   I wouldn't worry about stuff like that but given most Letsplayer's reputation i can see why people thought it would suck in hindsight.
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,MomiziWolfie,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:28 2015 UTC,"Alright i'm gonna be full out honest. I recently subscribed to the SBF youtube channel and started listening to their pod cast, and I think they're funny guys. Why were people so angry when Matt said he was gonna be on SleepyCast? I mean i've only been watching their stuff for about a month, but i've been enjoying it a lot.   The one thing I am bothered however is how the sub reddit acted ""two faced"" in a way. When it was first announced that they were gonna be on, everyone seemed to be pretty pissed off, and a lot of the top comments were hate, but then once Matt made a statement, everyone seemed to instantly love him. I felt indifferent and if anything excited so I was confused, but I just found it odd that once Matt made a comment, then the hate started to get the drain. Anyways, Im fine with the guests, mixes things up, which is always a good thing."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,ApacheMaster,2,Tue Jul 7 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"There was a bit of a brigade after it got xposted to the SBFP sub, and the people who were mad were still mad, they just got downvoted into oblivion."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,DrDongStrong,2,Wed Jul 8 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think you should get dunkey on your show. I feel like he's up your guys' alley."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,VeccLoL,2,Wed Jul 8 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I would love that, But Dunkey wouldn't agree to that. He's been known to be shy around his fans and is opening up now. In the near future, yes. But for now, let's just wait."

Sleepycabin,3cg52y,Deviate85,2,Tue Jul 7 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"My only problem was that the episode seemed pretty boring. The only parts that got me laughing or pretty interested were the Final Fantasy death sounds, the mock commercial, and the 2Snacks mention. Im not saying its bad, but it seemed quite the change of pace. I cant put my finger on it."

Sleepycabin,3cg52y,hellmasterx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"Too each their own but man I LOVED this podcast.   I'm a big fan of the SBF and SC so the two of them together was something I was really looked forward to. The podcast was really nice, just a bunch of guys talking and enjoying each others time. Like I wasn't expecting anything to be picture perfect but they this was way above what I was expecting and I couldn't be more happy.  If people don't like them because they are ""Let's Players"" well that's your problem. But I'd ask you to at least try some of their stuff, see their original content and get to know what kind of guys they are beside knowing they just do games.   Looking forward to more sleepycast and SBFcast"
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,TheDemonPirate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't see why it would be an issue if you guys even had, say, Pewdiepie on, if somehow it wound up happening (I know it wouldn't, but if it did, it would be under similar circumstances, for sure).  Not knowing a thing about (T/S)BFP, I thought this was one of the best.  I got to learn about content creators I didn't know about, and it was really entertaining.  You guys all discussed, and related, creative processes across mediums (even LP/Animation ideas), so the whole thing was, frankly, one of the best you guys have recorded.  Frankly, I hope you guys talk to a wide range of people, it's always interesting."
Sleepycabin,3cg52y,snipelfritzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:54:47 2015 UTC,They are your guests to have. I'd rather have someone interesting that you guys like that some boring/forced conversation with someone just because they animate.

So, I changed it around so it came across the same idea where it's building up to something great and mysterious, then just ends on absolutely nothing. And it just looked weird ending it on ""or"". I added ""whatever"" to make it complete."
Sleepycabin,3cmwzh,TedFartass,6,Thu Jul 9 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I gotcha. That is a pretty good conversion. Personally I don't care but I know kids and shit don't like to see that stuff."

Sleepycabin,3cmwzh,HCroaks,3,Thu Jul 9 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"I think that if you're not into swearing, that's fine, but perhaps Sleepycast wasn't the best topic for a shirt."

Sleepycabin,3cibp0,das_vargas,18,Wed Jul 8 03:39:27 2015 UTC,Since there isn't much material I just started from the beginning.  10 minutes and they're already talking about the best way to commit suicide and shooting babies in the head. Holy shit this is great.

If you're looking for the definitive, ultimate experience of SleepyCast, head on over to EPISODE 5- THE ROGUE FINGERER. This is by far one of the best episodes ever made in anything ever, and you will not regret listening to every single second of it over and over again like I have. This is the episode which will for sure make anyone who listens to it laugh, and get a good insight of what the Cabin is, due to it being a QnA episode as well.  You're welcome."

Sleepycabin,3cibp0,SenorBrochacho,3,Wed Jul 8 03:30:34 2015 UTC,"Episode 9 is pretty fucking great. If you can start from the beginning,use it as background noise if you have work,too."

Sleepycabin,3cibp0,AkronymCLT,4,Wed Jul 8 05:02:59 2015 UTC,I would mention that the guys get into some topics that some people may find uncomfortable. The TBFP episode has been probably one of their more 'tame' episodes (if tame is the correct word).
Sleepycabin,3cibp0,AkronymCLT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm hoping for. Not that I dislike TBFP's sunject matter, but I can tell they tone it down or dodge certain topics in videos and on the podcast."
Sleepycabin,3cibp0,Micalica,5,Wed Jul 8 07:11:59 2015 UTC,"In that case I'd say one of my favourite episodes has to be episode 17 ""Little Skatey"". It's one of the episodes where you get to hear Cory lose his shit and when he laughs like that it's hilarious."
Sleepycabin,3cibp0,mullases,2,Wed Jul 8 07:18:30 2015 UTC,Definitely. That and the Koffee Korner. The pure rage with which Cory delivers his anti-Dunkin doctrine is a sight to behold

Sleepycabin,3cibp0,Keaton223,2,Wed Jul 8 11:02:07 2015 UTC,just start with the pilot; you're probably gonna end up listening to it all anyways  also you won't miss any inside jokes

Sleepycabin,3cibp0,Micalica,2,Wed Jul 8 15:37:42 2015 UTC,Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the episodes. It's one of the few shows I've watched that has had consistently high quality across every single episode.

Have you seen the subreddit for his content? It's all shit posts. However toxic most of the GG community is Jon's could be worse.   I dunno I almost feel like I wouldn't want Danny or Arin on as guests because I feel like they would censor themselves. Arin would be good to have on for discussion about art and animation, plus I'm sure they have stories involving all of them together. But Danny is too nice."

Sleepycabin,3cgk24,fishpickle11,28,Wed Jul 8 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind them personally, but the Game Grumps fan base can be pretty awful. The fact that they had a conspiracy sub reddit just related to the show due to how obsessive they were over Jon's leave shows how they can act."
Sleepycabin,3cgk24,ZackNavySox27,50,Tue Jul 7 20:11:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there'd be a Sleepycabin conspiracy subreddit if Chris left suddenly and the rest of the guys avoided even mentioning him and removed his name from everything.
Sleepycabin,3cgk24,-BathroomTile-,11,Tue Jul 7 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think how the situation is treated has everything to do with it. But from the little bit that Jon has said about it it sounds like it's a contractual and/or privacy issue.   That being said it also has to do with how large GameGrumps was/is, when you pool that many fans together you're bound to get those certain fans that bounce strange theories between each other. I mean we've even had those type of posts on sleepycabin, albeit unfrequently, and this is a fairly small subreddit in comparison."
Sleepycabin,3cgk24,CommanderZiltoid,4,Wed Jul 8 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not too much to ask for the creators to ""lay down the law"" and be honest with their fan-base. The SleepyCrew has been good about that. It's just as manageable as any other party.   If Arin had explained everything 2 years ago, people may have been upset or even divided, but the whole situation would've blown over in like two weeks. (It's not like they killed anyone... I think.)  But I guess it doesn't matter at this point, the GG fan-base isn't what it once was. There's nothing to recover, it's just Grumblr."

Sleepycabin,3cgk24,DirtyMikNTheBoys,11,Wed Jul 8 01:45:20 2015 UTC,It's probably mostly has to do with geography.  Arin and Danny are in LA and the Sleepys are in Philly.

Sleepycabin,3ca6x5,Zedamdead,126,Mon Jul 6 08:45:10 2015 UTC,"it really depends. in situations where i have to do a few takes, my voice is usually gone by the end of it and i have to gargle warm salt water and eat raw honey. i'm aware that there is some technique that metal singers and voice actors use that involves them not actually fucking up their voice because they think ahead, but FUCK THAT. i think part of the reason my screams come out the way they do has to do with how badly i'm damaging my throat.   I HOPE THAT ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION"
Sleepycabin,3ca6x5,psychicpebble,47,Mon Jul 6 11:53:42 2015 UTC,"So I'm assuming that after you had finished the cover of Let it Go, your voice was a fucking train wreck?"

Sleepycabin,3ca6x5,psychicpebble,10,Mon Jul 6 15:22:51 2015 UTC,The reason I ask is because whenever you hit the extremes it all ready sounds like your vocal chords are damaged

Sleepycabin,3ca6x5,ToxikWafflez,6,Mon Jul 6 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"The technique btw is using your diaphragm instead of screaming from your throat. Like an audible sigh is using your diaphragm. I would suggest doing it, I used to metal scream from my throat and it ruined my voice for a week or so."

The best things to do is to make sure you do vocal warm ups, keep it to a BARE MINIMUM (Steve Blum doesn't do screaming sessions for longer than 2 hours now) and to do vocal cool downs too when done.  You can legit lose your voice and even require surgery if you work your cords to hard.  Fun fact: Paul Mccartney almost lost his voice after recording Twist and Shout for almost 8 hours straight."
Sleepycabin,3ca6x5,GraniteOverworld,2,Tue Jul 7 05:58:53 2015 UTC,"That was actually Lennon, my friend.

Sleepycabin,3c8xry,HypedPandaCSGOPP,21,Mon Jul 6 00:27:03 2015 UTC,Please don't
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Landocommando17,29,Mon Jul 6 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Don't speak for everyone, okay? I know these guys are busy, but for us patreon supporters who give money every month to them, it's annoying to see posts like this where we are basically told to fuck off when we have a criticism."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,andyhammdusky,23,Mon Jul 6 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I'd like to hope this Opinion isn't downvoted for being an opinion. Let's not pretend they're that busy though, they most likely aren't. Everyone says they're SOOOOO BUSY, NON STOP WORK DEATH PUNCH! But they're not, plain and simple. That doesn't mean we can't wait for sleepy cast, but I'm just not going to pretend people like Chris and zach who haven't released anything in over a year are so busy. Not saying they aren't busy, but not that busy.  The fact of the matter is, they're probably equally as busy as the rest of us, and aren't puting anything out not just because they're busy, but because they have other things going on outside of work and busy related things. Let's be honest, even if they just didn't feel like it, they would never admit that.   TL;DR, it's fine the podcast isn't out, but don't say it's  because they're working 24/7 & are about to die of work over load."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Scroke,11,Mon Jul 6 00:47:31 2015 UTC,I think they have alot of stuff they have made but havent released due to their standard of quality. It seems the way the cast is it is either the content is shitty on purpose or has a extreme amount of effort and polish so that artist integrity probably contributes to the content drought. Also I agree with you people on here kiss their asses to much everytime you say anything slightly critical or even question something these feral fans jump your bones! Like theyre big boys guys if someone pisses them off then they can assert the dominance theirselves.
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Zachtakecare,8,Mon Jul 6 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna say they don't work...but let's look at this objectively. They are earning thousands every month on their Patreon for the work they do. However, the work they do...is unrelated to the Patreon. None of those backers really see it. Except the podcast. Which has been behind schedule for weeks.  I ain't gonna say they're not working, or that I'm personally angry with them for not posting muh free entertainment, but I kinda feel like they're not taking it %100 seriously. I know in this case it's because Stamper's sick, but how many weeks are we gonna have an excuse like that? Why is it left in the hands of one fallible human being?   I hope the guys don't feel like they're being shit on for it, but we need to criticize them. Kissing an artist's ass gets nobody nowhere and I'm sure they can appreciate that sentiment."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,MrHap,9,Mon Jul 6 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I donate quite a bit of money every month. I feel kind of angry when there's just no podcast, no explanation, and if you dare ask a question you're jumped on.   I realized zack has explained everything already. but it's strange that if you speak even the slightest bit critically, you're jumped all over by rabid whitenight fans."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Haybox123,3,Mon Jul 6 02:29:43 2015 UTC,Well put. The supporters who pay definitely deserve weekly content in my eyes.
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Scroke,15,Mon Jul 6 02:20:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to throw in my two cents here.  You're all more than entitled to give some criticism, and you all sound pretty reasonable.  I guess part of the issue is how much work we ended up putting into ""just a podcast"".  You can look at other podcasts that are nothing more than people hitting RECORD and STOP and releasing that audio.  Stamper had a vision to make it a bit more than that so he and niall would go through the audio multiple times (that could be 2-3 hours) and try to cut it down to something that's the most entertaining 90 or so minutes we could come up with.  Plus there's adding the music, plus the occasional bits like little jingles or fake advertisements or adding effects to our voices...we even add custom art to many podcast album art / youtube videos.  I suppose at the end of the day we're all kind of disasters with trying to stay on schedule...this is a problem we all face with animation and it seems to just creep into anything we do that's remotely creative.  The Patreon took off probably better than we hoped, and the other work these guys also get can be uneven...large chunks of work can appear that they honestly have to do, and it can affect sleepycabin sometimes.  I'm probably rambling at this point but I know the guys were trying to figure out how to better handle alot of this going forward."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,JohnnyUtah001,5,Mon Jul 6 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"I want to explicitly point out before you read the rest of this that I could be 100% wrong on this, as these are estimates, and I'm not trying to downplay or shit on you guys either, I just think there's a more streamlined way of getting all of this done efficiently.  You know, if you guys are all too busy to get around to doing the dirty work on the audio and such, why not contract that out to somebody who does have the time and energy to do it? There are plenty of people out there (including me) who have experience editing audio and such that could do a few passes, maybe drop some keyframes or timestamps for stuff that needs a jingle or extra pizzaz like you were saying, and then pass that shit on to Stamper or Niall who can cut that shit together in as long as it takes to listen to it.   I'll do a quick estimate on what it takes to make the podcast based on my own experience with editing stuff like audio. Granted, I don't know the process you guys go through, but this is what I've come up with.  The chaps sit down and chat, let's say for around three hours total. This is not all usable content, but could be split up into some lost episodes or cut down to a more lengthy normal podcast.   Pass 1, you go through the audio, keeping track of jokes that might need editing later, filter out pops and noise, equalize the whole thing, make it listenable the first time around.  Total time: ~4-5 hours, give or take depending on what needs to be cut. This is plenty of work for one day.  Pass 2, add your music, sound effects, jingles and what not, maybe start working on artwork and such listen to the whole thing from start to finish once its complete, render the fucker out.  Total time: ~4-5 hours, once again, I'm listening the the whole thing in its entirety once everything has been edited together. You could probably go through both passes in one day if you stuck to it the whole time.  Finishing touches, maybe listen again for QA, gather artwork materials, upload that shit to the places it needs to go.  Total time: ~3-4 hous depending on how bad your internet is.  For any of these steps, I bet you could find someone willing to work for $100, $50, or honestly even lower if they are that desperate for something to do.  Shit I'd do it for free for you guys the first few times if it means getting the podcast out on a regular basis.  TL;DR There are resources out there on the interwebs that can get the grimy dirty stuff done to make your jobs easier, for free or on the cheap."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,noah998,3,Mon Jul 6 05:50:16 2015 UTC,"I think we can all appreciate how much work goes into the podcast, and it really shows. I think what we might be getting at (at least one of the points) is that perhaps Stamper should have handed the reins over to Nial for this one.   Now, I have no idea what Nial has on his schedule right now, but without really being told, it seems like a bit of a (and I use this word hesitantly) ""weak"" excuse.  Now, I get that Stamper's sick, and I hope he starts to feel well sooner rather than later, but why couldn't Nial edit this one to get it out on time?  On an sort of unrelated note, thanks for still being in touch with the community. Not just with announcements but with actual discussions, especially the critical ones. It shows a lot of integrity, and I think everyone respects it, even if we aren't too vocal about it.  EDIT: I forgot an ""e"""
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,THE_OVERBRINGER,3,Mon Jul 6 05:12:21 2015 UTC,"To me, it just seems like the work:worker ratio is greatly off balanced. It doesn't seem like the majority of people are particularly angry that not enough content is being made, rather, it seems that more people are just constantly disappointed with overly optimistic deadlines not being met. Just like when a highly anticipated game gets delayed; people hype themselves up for the release date and when it isn't met their overabundance of positive energy is turned negative. The most basic two solutions that I can see are either: more workers or less work. I'm sure that people would be more than ok with a high quality podcast being released every other week on time and maybe even some lost episodes thrown in randomly for kicks. Regardless of punctuality, people will always love Sleepycabin and the work that all of the members create; it's why they don't just leave. It should however be a priority to see that this issue is corrected. Until then, I'll be eagerly awaiting my next fix :)"
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,TheeEpicMan9000,7,Mon Jul 6 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"I agree i'm confused that we are funding crazy amounts of money currently 6.77 thousand dollars a month and it seems its not being put to use, For example Harry Partridge is broke as hell without any funding and still hired additional animators to put out a high quality artwork frame by frame Starbarians animation in under 2 weeks as well as Egoraptor with his own money to make full Starbomb music videos.  Yet we give all this money for the last year and get literally nothing in exchange nobody's released anything in over 11 months to a year plus besides Mick so i don't understand how the money which is extra on top of the existing incomes advertised for animation on Patreon has done nothing so far but get a post saying 'poor me where to busy' while everyone splashed out to move into their own houses recently which feels like kinda a backhand to backers.  I also don't get the added we all have full time jobs on top of Sleepycabin/Projects statement Zach made i mean besides Jeff & Stamper working at Newgrounds/The Behemoth no one has a full time job on top of this no ones working 9-5, 5 days a week at CostCo Chris plays video games and uploads them to his lets play channel on the weekend for extra income and Cory does commissions neither are full time jobs and one is playing video games which is the opposite of working i mean i'm working 2 jobs while studying and working for my 3rd year degree and have no free time and i'm not complaining about that but it just sounds a little off ... Ok you can call me a dick now."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,LargeGorrila,3,Mon Jul 6 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"You're right. I'm pretty sure they don't have full time jobs, they count their animating and stuff as full time jobs. I understand chris and zach not putting anything out for now considering their deal with the mystery TV skit people. They said by August we should see something. (Zach said in 2 months in a stream on Chris's twitch).   Still, I think people shouldn't back if they don't start putting things out :/"
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,Scroke,2,Mon Jul 6 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the way I see it, it's well and good for people to be encouraging them to take time off but patreon supporters are paying money to help fund the podcast and keep it running."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,rightyguitarist,-10,Mon Jul 6 01:30:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I think they're busy. All of them have full time jobs, projects, Sleepy Cabin work and on that Stamper is sick plus we're all pressing them to do another podcast. I'm sure all of us don't want our favorite people burning out on us and feeling pestered then offering low quality work because they're dead tired."

I'm paying so that they have the means to not feel rushed and can get shit done exactly the way they want it, no matter how long it may take. I dunno, I'm bored with the internet nowadays and Sleepy Cabin is just getting started."
Sleepycabin,3c8xry,ellyrox,-2,Tue Jul 7 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"I support them on patreon too, but I realize that the patreon isn't the end all of the projects they have to support them, realistically, the money from patreon manages to keep the office open, and the lights on. They still need to do other work to keep afloat and give them time to make the silly bullshit for us backers."

Sleepycabin,3c02ec,TARDIS-Engineer,2,Fri Jul 3 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"Explaining Leo and satan for people who don't know... Oney and the voice actor for Satan don't work good together anymore. Oney also payed 6 grand for a big studio to animate for them but they basically made the worst animation for it, so he never released it."
Sleepycabin,3c02ec,CrugarzVID,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:38:22 2015 UTC,"For one, I think people might be overlooking how hard it is to write a script for those things - animation is only half of the deal, it's the idea that counts. So coming up with funny stuff for that one series might be fairly difficult, because when you have only one universe, then you got to have a goal where the thing is heading and a shit-load of jokes stashed away, if there isn't, people will lose interest. That's why you don't see a lot of animators creating one series, they swap from one universe to the next, because it's more easy to generate interesting content that way. On the other hand, SpongeBob and the like never had any goal to begin and were all-over-the-place, so I might be just wrong.   Plus, not sure how Sean Kiely (the voice of Satan) is doing, since I haven't seen or heard Chris mention him anywhere since DemonVault. But that again might not be the issue, since someone like Mick could easily do a similar voice.   I think the main issue is that even if Chris is a freaking great animator, he might lack experience working with a large team. More to the fact, large studios release schedules are extremely inflexible. Let's say you have a 12 episode season planned (we already got one pilot out): the first quarter is going to be spend with the organization of things (meetings, workshops, research, schedules, rules, priorities); then (Q2) we proceed to storyboards, storylines, and scripts (remember we have 12 episodes to plan ~20min); after that comes Q3 the production (animation, voice-acting, backgrounds, lighting, effects, cleanups, rendering, corrections); and then we run the series weekly for Q4. So if you screw one of these stages, the next one is going to suffer, and you'll be late and the sponsors angry.  There's so much shit to do that one might lose their mind just by thinking about it. I'm not doubting Chris' abilities, just saying it might be the thing that's holding him back."

What they need for the show is a solid lead who can keep everything smooth and bring up the energy. Also, more planning would be better. The beginning of the podcast consisted of small talk and one of the guys saying that he's just thinking of something to say.

Or they might not like his stuff personally i think it's ok even if his art and animation isn't anything special but it's mostly pretty unique and well humored.
Sleepycabin,3bua4d,rippedstallion,2,Thu Jul 2 13:39:47 2015 UTC,Dang. I listened to that podcast way back in 2007 or something when I first started animating. Thanks for the memories.

Sleepycabin,3bua4d,ZazDupree,-6,Thu Jul 2 07:59:15 2015 UTC,"Filmcow is complete garbage from writing, animation, and art on the whole.  There's probably nothing, short of actually raping or killing someone, that would make me dislike any of the guys in sleepycabin, but it would be disappointing to see them work with Jason Steele."
Sleepycabin,3bua4d,LargeGorrila,4,Thu Jul 2 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Right... Because stuff like Dragon Ball PEEPEE are artistic masterpieces , I like and support the guys but its not like it's the best writing/art on the planet lets be honest."
Sleepycabin,3bua4d,ZazDupree,4,Thu Jul 2 22:38:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really care if you think Filmcow is funny, but the problem with them is the fact that they never attempt to explore, expand, or improve on their art.  Also,  almost every Filmcow cartoon is written the same, just go through and watch some of their cartoons and you'll notice the exact pattern everyone of them falls into.  The thing that sets the sleepycabin guys apart is that if you go back and watch their earlier stuff and compare it to their new stuff, in every respect, posing, animation, writing, audio, they improve and, if you listen to the podcast you know they are seeking to improve.  I can't respect Jason Steele as an artist, nothing has changed or improved since he wrote Charlie the unicorn like 10 years ago."
Sleepycabin,3bua4d,dweengus,3,Fri Jul 3 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"Indeed. To be truthful, he can't draw (look at his recent art sale for example). He's so different from the Sleepycabin guys, pretty much their opposite, and I think it'd be pretty interesting to see them interact with each other just because they're so unlike each other. I do like his old podcast with Benfer, and I think him getting together with the guys would also be fun to see."

Sleepycabin,3big5q,sirmidor,16,Mon Jun 29 18:38:56 2015 UTC,Matt isn't Mr PG Nice Man.   He made a joke recently with his co-star Pat about waterboarding someone with a Jason mask with semen.   Matt's hardcore.
Sleepycabin,3big5q,GameBoy09,-18,Mon Jun 29 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"except he did literally tell the other members of the Zaibatsu to stop making rapehorse jokes after someone wrote a complaint on his tumblr wall. so if this was indeed a rape joke, it'd mean he evolved from pandering to not giving a fuck, which would be awesome."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,sirmidor,16,Mon Jun 29 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I remember that, that podcast was like a year ago I believe.   But I'll just tell you Matt isn't stupid. He understands the humor of SleepyCast and isn't going to be a ""SJW"" like some of you guys are claiming. I remember that he partied with Stamper on multiple occasions, like 3 to 5 times and had marvelous stories about him. Like him kissing a male waiter or a hobo or something, he also stole silverware."

Sleepycabin,3big5q,The_Mexorcist26,-2,Tue Jun 30 05:37:40 2015 UTC,I like the superbestfriends but i feel like their humor is too different compared to sleepycabin especially matts. I'd be lying if i said i wasn't nervous about this episode.
Sleepycabin,3big5q,Kingofpinatas,11,Tue Jun 30 07:19:18 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain extent, but with Woolie to bounce of and with Stamper, Chris and Mick (who are less in your face than Niall, Corey and Zach), I think I still have faith."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,elemlo,4,Mon Jun 29 21:03:51 2015 UTC,Yeah you're probably right. I'm just being negative for something that will probably be great.
Sleepycabin,3big5q,Kingofpinatas,2,Tue Jun 30 00:40:42 2015 UTC,The podcast is about to get hype. I'm excited!!! Fuck the other people here!!
Sleepycabin,3big5q,ToxikWafflez,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:52:15 2015 UTC,"It's funny looking at the community a few days ago and seeing everyone acting civil for the most part.... looking at this, now I see everyone's true colors. On the not of this however, i'm glad to hear Matt and Woolie will be joining the next podcast."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,someone_unkown,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"I just find it a little funny that they're featuring let's players (I know, most of the SC guys have played games on a stream, and Oney has a channel, and that Jeff was being an entertainer and that).  That said, since I don't follow TBFG (I've heard good things about it, but it's a little long for me to watch daily, which I respect), I'm looking forward to something that I can honestly have no expectations for."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,knocklessmonster,-19,Mon Jun 29 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"hmm, i don't know how to feel about that.    part of the reason i love the sleepycast is the humor, the no-boundaries ""funny jokes are funny jokes, period"" riffing. by comparison, Matt has never made jokes that aren't pretty tame.  he didn't even dare say ""nigga"" when he and Woolie were singing a rap song on one of their cryme time videos. most of his jokes are just hyperboles. he can be funny in his own way, definitely, just not in the way Sleepycast is. he's not an animator, he can't relate to them on that level. not to mention, he's quite shouty, which i normally hate. Cory gets a pass because he's funny while doing it most of the time.    I love the Zaibatsu and i still watch some of their content, but i wouldn't have thought Matt a fit for Sleepycast.    who knows, maybe it'll be a great podcast. i hope so, i need my fix."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,sirmidor,21,Mon Jun 29 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"As long as he doesn't force the others to be tame, why does it matter?"
Sleepycabin,3big5q,Ultimate_Cabooser,-10,Mon Jun 29 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"a podcast is succesful when the people on it complement each other. however cliche it might be, when the result is better than the sum of its parts. otherwise they might as well do solo casts.    a guest that doesn't fit in, doesn't really add much. to clarify, i'm not saying Matt can't be a funny guy, i'm saying his sense of comedy, at least to me, seems far removed from the general sleepycast humor.    but not every guest needs to be cracking jokes all the time, a guest with good stories can be just as great.    except Matt doesn't really have a lot in common with them. he was in QA and has stories about that and is interested in comics and games, neither of which i feel any of the sleepycast members have really cared enough about to discuss at any length in the previous sleepycast episodes.    maybe i'm just crazy, but i've always felt a guest should have a lot of overlapping interests to make it worthwhile and jokes a nice bonus. don't get me wrong, i'm hoping it'll be a great sleepycast, i'm just saying i'm not expecting it."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,sirmidor,4,Tue Jun 30 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno about people on the casts needing to be similar, Jeff is probably the highlight of sleepycast for me, and if anything its because it feels like he's Alice and he' stuck in some nightmare wonderland, being pressured to answer questions about sucking everything's dick."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,SnagglepussZA,4,Tue Jun 30 01:49:34 2015 UTC,"a podcast is succesful when the people on it complement each other But you can still complement by contrasting. The reason Mick or Jeff works well with Zach or Corey is because they can play of the difference between them.   Also, if I recall correctly games have been discussed on the Sleepycast, and Mick, Jeff, Niall and Chris have all streamed videogames. I also find overlapping interests less important than dynamic, since the topics discussed are sometimes so weird and all over the place."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,elemlo,7,Mon Jun 29 15:30:01 2015 UTC,HOW DARE HE NOT SAY NIGGA. WHAT A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. /s
Sleepycabin,3big5q,Centila,7,Mon Jun 29 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"he didn't even dare say ""nigga"" when he and Woolie were singing a rap song on one of their cryme time videos.   He's said it a few times in other videos. They even made a joke about ""3/4 of a person"" on one of their podcasts. They also joke about buttfucking with rubber fists and make lewd jokes about Liam and anime girls all the time.  Did you just watch a few videos and decide ""they aren't arguing about sucking dicks, I don't like it""? Or what?"
Sleepycabin,3big5q,boredcanadian,-4,Mon Jun 29 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"It's easy to be irreverent and crass, the sleepy cabin guys get really fucking in there though, the exaggerated vitriol and personal attacks in the sleepy cast is in a different league then the SBFC.   Matt is easily the most sensitive member of the zaibatsu as well, during fisticuffs the dudes have to cheer on Matt when they freely shit on each other. I'm a big fan of both groups but let's be real."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,WallaDallaDoo,2,Tue Jun 30 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"TL;DR There's potential for this to be great, don't knock it till you hear it.  Lately Matt has been doing a goofy diet that's made him a little pissy according to one of the podcasts, so I imagine the guys are being accommodating and not giving him too much shit, but they definitely throw some his way as well, and have before. The other guys have sandbagged some comments about themselves in the past as well, not as hard as ""Diet-Matt and the gully-gully"" but it happens.  While I do agree that the tones of the two groups do seem different, the likeliest reason is that the Zaibatsu are mostly advertiser funded now, whereas sleepycabin is fan/patreon funded endeavor.  Now, if you take a couple of them out of an environment where you can say whatever without advertisers skittering away like cockroaches when you turn on a light, they're free to have unrestrained bullshit sessions. I kind of feel like they can barely contain themselves sometimes and probably have to edit out a few offhand comments here and there to keep it ad-friendly.  Also, if you listen to the rest of the guest-cabin podcasts, they're pretty restrained towards the guests compared to normal, except the second sabtastic one, and the one with that couple that I forget the names of, so I'm curious how they handle this one.  If Matt is feeling good now, since he's in contact with a competent nutritionist, I can't wait for him and Woolie to get into the shit with the guys, but if it's toned down I feel like it can still be a great podcast."
Sleepycabin,3big5q,boredcanadian,2,Mon Jun 29 18:16:52 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm pumped for the podcast, either way it goes it should be entertaining. Probably not as sporadic and ridiculous as podcasts with Corey Zach n Chris. A SuperSleepyCast will be cool."

I feel that a lot of fundamentals (perspective, shadings, anatomy, etc)  are the easiest to master traditionally, and that a lot of the brushes and shaders a program offers can overwhelm someone starting out. Drawing on a tablet and on pen and paper are different experiences, but I feel you will learn much faster if you start off traditionally."

I'm all for Hitler jokes but this would give me the wrong idea about these guys if I came to the panel and saw this"
Sleepycabin,3b8w8s,Checkerszero,33,Fri Jun 26 23:54:31 2015 UTC,The idea is hilarious though. Imagine walking past the entry doors only to see Zach standing on the table screaming hyperbolic/satirical slurs.
Sleepycabin,3b8w8s,Dolvak,-17,Sat Jun 27 01:56:52 2015 UTC,Oh fuck off man. Like I don't want to be a dick but how do you listen to sleepycabin and think some jokes could be to extreme?

Sleepycabin,3b8w8s,sirmidor,14,Sat Jun 27 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Calm down, the only reason I was concerned was because because joking is not nearly as extreme as actually doing something. Joking about Hitler and anti religion stuff is different than putting up Hitler banners and screaming ""Hail Hitler!!"" And I mean how mature are you finding it necessary to say fuck off to a persons harmless opinion not even aimed towards you?"
Sleepycabin,3b8w8s,legonro,-12,Sat Jun 27 04:20:35 2015 UTC,"Joking about Hitler and anti religion stuff is different than putting up Hitler banners and screaming ""Hail Hitler!!""     it's ""Heil"", Hail is the weather condition, you know, the frozen pellets of rain falling down? i doubt anyone would come to the panel besides the community. the community who knows their general sense of humor and knows that they're not actually bigots/racists/whatever else. i don't see what's wrong with making a practical joke with people who know you're joking.  i know the picture's an edit, but if they had actually done it, i wouldn't have thought it was over the line. if they'd handled it well, it would've been pretty funny, just like with any subject. imagine: just a big nazi banner hanging behind them while they do the panel. they don't look at it, they don't do anything diffferently, they don't acknowledge it's there, they just do their panel. i would've thought it was funny.    And I mean how mature are you finding it necessary to say fuck off to a persons harmless opinion   i don't think being mature or immature has anything to do with it. he strongly felt you were overreacting, he expressed that in his words. maybe you don't like the words he used, but that's your problem. i feel that bringing the whole ""well, that's just immature"" argument into a conversation is, fittingly, a bit immature.     not even aimed towards you?       this is reddit. it's a public site. as soon as you posted your comment, you're open to replies, whether positive or negative."

Someone asked if Stamper and Niall would share it a'la Lady &amp;amp; the Tramp style. They did. It was glorious.

I wouldn't recommend that though, because you really have to be some kind of savant in order to do that.  I know music theory because of school, but there's plenty of YouTube videos and books that can teach you the basics of orchestral music. Don't be afraid to experiment with making music, because there's plenty of communities that will give you feedback, which is really the most valuable way of learning. I also know a bit about FL Studio, so feel free to ask me any questions you might have!  Ninja Edit: there's also plenty of free soundfonts to utilize if you can't shell out the billions of dollars for the high quality samples. I'll try to find them if I can.

Sleepycabin,3b3tye,legonro,5,Thu Jun 25 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"The only problem is the guys issues with YouTube. It sends like they want to be on patreon more because it is a better format for animation. By giving this content on YouTube, it further takes away from their own patreon. I could see them having the sound as just a way to reach more people but I get the feeling it's not the intended format nor is it one they would want to focus too hard on  TL;DR it takes away from their own site getting traffic because YouTube art incentive"
Sleepycabin,3b3tye,thelaffingman1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"Far from everyone is going to pay their patreon for podcasts though. Not to mention, it's not animation and they will still get adsense money for it, unlike on soundcloud and others. I agree with you mostly, but for an occasional podcast special, I don't think youtube is not a big problem at all.   Also, they can just embed the YouTube link to their site and make it link view only so people will have to go to the site first anyway. (If that was their goal)"
Sleepycabin,3b3tye,Checkerszero,3,Thu Jun 25 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"I've been very outspoken to ""what if we"" and ""what if they"" posts, but this is a decent idea. If YouTube is an issue, a post with the art embedded and the audio clip at the top would do fine.   I'm sure they'd of already done it if they felt like it though. Even with a loose sense of the word, they're a creative studio. Showcasing themselves/their work takes priority over fan engagement, as it should.  Regardless, glad you entertained the thought."

Sleepycabin,3b0id2,Sponchman,2,Thu Jun 25 06:13:32 2015 UTC,"I learned how to animate on Toon Boom. I definitely recommend it. It's an animation program, unlike flash.

Sleepycabin,3b0id2,comradeBodko,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:31:44 2015 UTC,In what ways is Toonboom superior?
Sleepycabin,3b0id2,lvl5LazorLotus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"ToonBoom has superior line quality/drawing, actual tools for rigging 2D characters, I believe some lighting effects, etc.  The drawing is the big reason I'd recommend starting with it.  Flash has very obtuse drawing, even in the better versions (it's gotten worse as they've upgraded the software, and I'm not exaggerating).  Toon Boom's drawing is more intuitive, plus I'm fairly sure it has tools for utilizing different kinds of brushes or at least applying effects to your lines, as opposed to Flash's awkward brush and awkward pencil tools.  Just to clarify, I don't own a copy of ToonBoom, but I've used it in the past.  I stick with Flash because I already own a license for it and know my way around the software, but at some point in the future I intend to make the jump."

Sleepycabin,3av6nh,CrugarzVID,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"Toon Boom is a better option but more expensive, which I assume is why you excluded it in your post.  Like someone else stated, there are multiple torrents out there.  And if you've already purchased a license I don't think reacquiring the software that way is illegal.  I've heard good things about tvPaint, but I have no first-hand experience with it."

If it's animated, you'll get to pick up on different color schemes and art styles. If it's not, you'll get to see how it was filmed, special effects, and overall structure of how it was made. Also, you'll get to here different music scores as the series goes on. If you want a suggestion, maybe watch Avatar: The Last Airbender, then its spinoff/sequel Korra.  TV shows will help you get inspiration in life and your art that you make."

You actually pay a fee to upload files on Vimeo and the viewers get a premium, ads-free experience. It's not for content creators who want to make money from viewer ad-revenue. It's for companies that have different sources of income.  Plus, Vimeo doesn't really have any subscription system and discovery features, and if you watch a video on Vimeo, you either came from somewhere else or view the embedded version, so the artists can't just put a video on there and it will get popular ""almost on its own"" like it is with YouTube (obviously I exaggerate here, but its simply less ""viral  friendly"" than YouTube.)"

Sleepycabin,3akwu6,CrugarzVID,3,Sun Jun 21 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"They work on every individual episode at the same time. They have to voice it. Storyboard it. Run it by people in charge. Rewrite it. Plan it out scene by scene. Then send it over seas to get it animated. And the animation process is long and enduring, this does not apply to just Seth McFarland. All shows take at least this amount of time. This gives people enough time to retake any mistakes with voice acting or animation. Make sure the writing is there. And plan out the entire season.  There is smaller/more bigger things involved but what I said is the just of it. Idk if I helped at all. But I hope I answered your question."
Sleepycabin,3akwu6,RugHusky,3,Sun Jun 21 05:36:51 2015 UTC,I essentially feel that the crew does the same thing but with a smaller team. I know they take longer because they animate better and if hellbenders was a series I would assume that they would take less time to make each episode. Also I know a lot of series that take much less time to make good content such as Steven universe. They were on hiatus for a few months to make a stockpile of episodes plus a new intro.

Sleepycabin,3afukk,GraniteOverworld,5,Fri Jun 19 20:12:53 2015 UTC,the Renaissance Ara of creating a hub for animation has for the most part gone and past up for other quicker means of content whether that is lp videos or streams. Im not sure such a idea would happen in 2015 or any time soon
Sleepycabin,3afukk,Spazkidin3d,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"Well the way I look at it when there's a hole to be filled, there's a way to fill it, and animators and basically anyone who creates more involved content need a better breeding ground to hang around, or at least start. A place where constructive criticism and community support are the focus, y'know? Granted it wouldn't be a place where you make your money, but it'd at least be a place where budding animators can help each other out and make connections. Then with time it could grow into a place that actually could at least give back to content creators a little more than what we've got going on right now.  Edit: Also, I would say that, yeah, something like this would be the tiniest fish in the biggest pond, but everything has to start somewhere. Newgrounds took a good many years to actually start gaining traction, and hell, even Facebook took like four years before anyone gave a shit about it. Would this site be in the same league as those two? No, probably not, but it'd still be a better place to start out than a lot of other places these days."

Sleepycabin,3afukk,ron-salcewicz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"To be frank, the oceanic size comes from the fact that there's shit-loads of bad animations. It's not the matter of creating a platform, but making your work original and the highest quality - if you accomplish that, YouTube will do the rest of the work. Not sure where you got the idea that the algorithms are bad, you just haven't put your name out there.  It's also the attitude - if you post racist, suggestive cartoons, you'll attract the audience that is prone to rude behavior; but if you have content that is neutral or poses some intelligent questions, then usually people with better online manners will engage in your content (not always, pure stereotypes). So it would be silly to expect a well written review from fans that like, for instance, horse ass rape humor.  The thing is, everyone wants fame/attention/time-consuming reviews, and want it now, they're not willing to work their butt off. Only after the tenth, maybe the twentieth short, you'll not have to worry about the engagement from people; before that, honestly, nobody gives a fuck, because everything we do is egoistic and self-centered, so to do a constructive critique of your work, there has to be something to gain for me (your attention, for example).   Hope this helps."

Sleepycabin,3ag9nh,ellyrox,0,Sat Jun 20 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"I Kickboxed and wrestled since I was 7 years old. I won some titles in both, nobody really bothered me for a physical altercation in high school.   I'm in an idustrial workplace now and it's weird dealing with dickheads that don't know my past. I just ignore them.  The weird thing about getting to a certain level in martial arts, you lose your ego. You have to be humble to get better.  Violence solves nothing folks!"

Sleepycabin,3adfoa,JoJoTheFlynn,19,Fri Jun 19 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"just say it. don't be passive aggressive, just be a straight shooter. DON'T YELL, they'll get over it.  Hearing criticism from those out of your field is acceptable to a point. I think the person doing the criticizing should be more aware though.  If you're say..being critical of a game developer, unless you've been though that hell you really don't know what you're talking about with a large multitude of things.  It seems like with issues like that, you need a bit of experience and sympathy and not just ""WELL THIS IS BAD, THIS IS WRONG."" even if you're more correct that not, you don't have any real understanding in many cases to actually help...which is probably the point of criticism in the first place.  WHAT DO I KNOW"
Sleepycabin,3adfoa,JohnnyUtah001,5,Fri Jun 19 06:56:39 2015 UTC,I know its jeff cos of the flair
Sleepycabin,3adfoa,Landocommando17,2,Fri Jun 19 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"No matter how gently one writes a critique or approaches the subject, any criticism will feel personal, since the artist/developer/writer invests time and feelings in his creation.   I think, the point about hearing criticism from only the people of your field is kinda unfair, since an argument should be taken without any prejudice to the person. For example, you don't need to be a chef to know if something tastes awful; you don't need to be a game designer to see if something hurts your eyes. Only the arguments should matter. If you're cherry picking the people you want to hear the criticism from, you again, create an illusion about your capabilities.   I completely agree that to really be able to evaluate something, one should experience the pain and suffering of the process, but then again, who doesn't have to go through hell? Engineers spend years and years developing a car and people just by one look can say, ""That car looks crap."" For those who understand the pain, the creation will have a more special meaning; however, when you create something, you create it for the general public, not those few individuals, so their voice is what really matters (they will buy it, use it).   ""Do you feel those who are more harsh in their critique are more effective...""  Look at this in another light, if you only drift towards the nice critiques, you'll keep everything as it is and never improve yourself or the  creation - it will always seem like you're the best. The fair critiques (not harsh, not sugar coated - minimal in subjectivity) should illustrate your current capabilities and create a small guide on what to improve.   ""That's the big difference between life and video games - in video games, you get experience when you kill a monster; in life, you get experience when the monster kills you."""
Sleepycabin,3adfoa,ron-salcewicz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:13:37 2015 UTC,Something I've seen artists do is say a couple things that are good about a piece before critiquing the bad stuff. I think it helps make the critique not seem so cynical and it's probably easier to take the criticism if you know you are doing well in some aspects.
Sleepycabin,3adfoa,mickaleaf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:17:02 2015 UTC,"IMO don't pussyfoot around with it. Criticism is a good thing. It helps us grow. Just don't be a cunt about it. ""lol, you suck faggot"" and ""this is a bit off, you could improve here, here and here etc"". Which one is more helpful?"

Saw the live band back in 2012 and it was alot of fun. China, IL is alright. I'm looking forward to Lakewood Plaza Turbo eventually becoming a full series on Cartoon Network and hopefully they can bring back the voice of Kid Goku/Gohan from the pilot when it gets greenlit. IFC did this little cartoon from some South Park producers called, ""Out There"" that I really liked that only lasted a season. Might be on Netflix. Another showcase for Justin Roiland's voice acting talents. It had a nice team behind it and it was really chill to watch.  Hopefully the crew has checked out ""Over the Garden Wall"" which has to be the network's and their animation studio's magnum opus in my opinion since Tartakovsky and McCraken left. Also why are they doing a Powerpuff Girls reboot? Ugh."

Sleepycabin,3aby7g,GraniteOverworld,3,Fri Jun 19 06:16:07 2015 UTC,I was just thinking about how people draw you guys/the guys with such a concrete image of what you look like but I don't feel like I've ever seen an image of Jeff or Zach.  Either someone has dug through videos and things to find images of them or it has just sort of developed as an idiom as to what they look like.  Probably a combination of both.
Sleepycabin,3aby7g,ToxikWafflez,5,Thu Jun 18 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"They're not hard to find. Jeff was at the Sleepycabin Magfest panel, and Zach was at an animation panel the year before."

I presume it's just for the sake of general information, because there really is a stupid amount of misinformation and misconceptions about the food industry and livestock, in terms of what does and what should happen. He presents his methods, extrapolates on why he does them and why he thinks they're most humane/efficient/etc. and even tacks on some fun duck trivia.

McButts: ""If you're saying that my exaggeration about you having a boner is reality then yeah, that's a bit much. You could wait til the camera's off to bust out the lotion and start pinching your nipples to the dead hanging fox. I guess I come from some fucked up place where you don't jerk it to dead animals.

Sleepycabin,3a2qzm,goochmaster5,5,Thu Jun 18 02:04:53 2015 UTC,God what the fuck. He starts talking about a family show and then pans to his asshole.
Sleepycabin,3a2qzm,CrugarzVID,3,Wed Jun 17 11:12:50 2015 UTC,So does he explain in the video why he hung the fox up like that? I can understand why he killed it since it was killing his ducks but I don't really get how he benefits from it being hung up there like that.
Sleepycabin,3a2qzm,PadleySmish,3,Wed Jun 17 14:00:47 2015 UTC,I think he was just pissed off because the ducks are part of his job and the fox fucked that up. I guess I can see where he's coming from but he went a bit far with it.

Sleepycabin,3a17rg,Ademan,6,Tue Jun 16 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"This is really fascinating.

Sleepycabin,3a17rg,DanubeAllDay,8,Wed Jun 17 11:18:13 2015 UTC,"I'd assume because in the cast it's sandwiched between fucked up shit, and Jeff wasn't painting him/what he does in the nicest light.   When I watched the vid I was like ""Oh, well he's just doing his job. How fascinating""   We're presupposing that he knows the Sleepycabin audience and members and what we're like. I can understand his gut reaction completely, if all he knows is YouTube comments.   Here, we all know we're smarter/nicer than he gives us credit for, and that's fine."
Sleepycabin,3a17rg,TehEp1cPengu1n,-15,Wed Jun 17 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"I got to where he held the neck to the log and clicked off it's kinda like they talked about on the podcast i can't watch animal abuse/death.  It's weird reading the comments with guys saying:  'you are my FAVORITE YouTuber of all time. I think you did a good way to cull and duck. i cull ducks too and im going to do your way because i love it.' - Derpycowie & 'Dear, ""50 Ducks in A Hot Tub"" - I have watched quite a few of your videoes. Brilliant, I must say:) Want to buy your T-shirt, any left?' -Anna Appidaze  And all those comments have a good amount of likes.

Sleepycabin,39yvuw,ajtpak,2,Fri Jun 19 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"The best examples are probably onwards of episode 64--the ones where he shoots the coyote and fox. Fun fact: the coyote is STILL hanging from the tree in his yard currently. He never took it down and it's just a decomposed lump that you can occasionally see when he films the ducks walking to the swamp.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKlF3Hl80MA  Generally I started watching because I wanted to see cute ducks, but I still understood that they were raised as food, so I tried not to get too attached. Eventually I just started noticing weirder and weirder things and now I watch the show just as much to see the odd things he does than I do to see cute baby birds.    EDIT: I thought I linked the video with the dead coyote hanging from a tree, but he must have taken it down. He had one around that time that was especially disgusting - where maggots had infested the carcass and he filmed the whole thing in high def. for way too long. It makes sense that he'd remove it."

Sleepycabin,39wbso,snipelfritzy,4,Mon Jun 15 11:29:39 2015 UTC,"But do you understand where I'm coming from? Like if they had some episodes saved for situations where if a regular episode couldn't be uploaded, they have a back up episode ready so there wasn't a big uproar by the community.

Sleepycabin,39wbso,Checkerszero,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:51:16 2015 UTC,Im conflicted because I can listen to a lost episode but I get more excited when I see a regular episode posted. Maybe because they'll probably talk about more relevant information or have more people telling funny jokes. The sabrina lost episode was good but in the back of my head I knew that it was probably recorded a few weeks from then; I didnt think about that at the time neccessarily but I kinda do now I guess?

Sleepycabin,39scgb,JoJoTheFlynn,12,Sun Jun 14 07:47:39 2015 UTC,"not california, Everyone wants to go there because its the state of oppertunity, or so they would let you believe, you'll end up paying a fortune to live in a crack den, and theres a whole lotta luck involved in making it out there. Its really based on who you know, and how much money you have. In SOME cases if you are hired, they will ask you to come out there.  I believe we talked about california on the original sleepycast, around episode 3 I believe, I cant remember but its was deff before 10"
Sleepycabin,39scgb,Spazkidin3d,3,Sun Jun 14 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"dont forget that living in new York is kind of the same thing  pay a fortune to live in a filthy hovel  why doesn't she look into other options, OP?"
Sleepycabin,39scgb,legonro,3,Mon Jun 15 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who lives in California there a few things you/she need to know. Yes, everything here is much more expensive. I live in the south Bay region and pay around $860 a month for a studio apartment. Fairly big enough but still. Also, there are good areas (redondo beach, marina del Rey, Irvine, Glendale) and there are bad areas (LA, Compton, Hollywood). Moving here won't give you any more opportunities unless you already have your foot in the door. If you have already been talking to some of these companies and are interested in giving you a job, go for it. But if you come here looking for a job you will probably fail. LA is full of people hoping to ""make it"" and only around 13 percent actually succeed. Look at your current circumstances and decide if that's the best decision for you."
Sleepycabin,39scgb,Dimwit0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem people have when coming to California is that they don't realize there are more cities in the state than just LA and San Diego. With that being said, it is more expensive state-wide for everything regardless, but you can save a lot of money by living 40 minutes outside of LA like in Riverside or another similar surrounding area. LA is only for people who can handle and afford it."

Sleepycabin,39kb1y,Synikul,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:39:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input. I agree. That would have made it better
Sleepycabin,39kb1y,impossibru65,2,Tue Jun 16 10:06:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly loved this. You guys have the humor and timing down pretty well. If I had one criticism, it would be on an acting level: facial expressions go a long way. For silly, ridiculous stuff like this, you don't want to overplay it, but exaggerate your facial expressions a little more. Towards the end it really worked, but towards the beginning a lot of the emotions on your faces were a little too neutral, given the situation.   Like I said, it's just a little thing to improve on a great thing you guys have going. I'm not a professional actor (yet), but as a student, you learn early on that facial expressions (especially for close-ups) are a huge deal in filming, as film acting is filled with physical subtleties to make it funny, sad, badass, scary, etc. When you get a hold of that, it really separates you from the rest in a way.  Keep it up!"

Hell, you could make a beautiful artsy cartoon and invest all your time in it, and if you drew titties somewhere in there youd get straight 5s and thats all people would comment on. all newgrounds wants is the hottest trends and tits. Dont be discouraged cuz you dont impress a bunch of kids, worry about those opinions that matter, that YOU care about."
Sleepycabin,39ip7e,Spazkidin3d,6,Sat Jun 13 04:04:41 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Wow, thanks for those kind words. That means a LOT coming from one of you guys. I'll keep at what I'm doing and only try to better myself, and thanks. Hopefully one day I can make as good of content as you guys, but until then - time for me to go practice, practice, practice. And by the way, are there any good animation communities out there you know of? I mean the best I've found is ol' ng, and even then, at least half of the community there are fucks."
Sleepycabin,39ip7e,GraniteOverworld,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:37:36 2015 UTC,I know of no other places to upload animation currently. I'm actually in the mind to get some people together and start a new site that focuses more on high quality work that aims for an older demographic. Animators and content creators in general really need a place like that these days.
Sleepycabin,39ip7e,goochmaster5,9,Fri Jun 19 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"One of the things about being on the internet is that it helps you grow a thick skin.  Now, I'm being 100% serious when I say this; I used to makes memes and rage comics and post them to funnyjunk. While some of the community is cool, a lot of them are absolute dickheads. So, despite my contribution of shitty memes plaguing the internet, it actually taught me that being able to take hate in stride is a valuable skill that any content creator, at any skill level should learn.  So essentially, if it's a comment calling you a fag, or to fuck off and die, and it has no valid criticism whatsoever, just ignore it. Actually, laugh at the absurdity that someone would go through the trouble of leaving hateful messages, because you can rest easy knowing that you have a better life than they do"
Sleepycabin,39ip7e,Scroke,5,Fri Jun 12 06:57:28 2015 UTC,It's because only sad angry people leave hate comments or people not connected to their sense of humor.

For those interested, it was a commercial for Belgian public buses and about how less stressful they are than going to the city by car because you have to find a parking spot and pay for it (and then your coins fall on the ground, which makes it even more stressful). But the whole thing was extra ironic since Belgians are extremely inefficient in nearly any subject (except making beer) and everybody always complains about public buses because the buses are always late."

Sleepycabin,38t9f5,Scroke,52,Sat Jun 6 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"well actually full episodes are over 1 hr 20 mins. ususally.  lost are either when people are gone or schecuals are messy, there episodes for just such occasions."
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,Spazkidin3d,17,Sat Jun 6 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Are some of them also ""outtakes"", so to speak, from regular episodes? Because some of them feel that way"
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,goochmaster5,27,Sat Jun 6 18:57:39 2015 UTC,its a mixture of both but its more or less what I said before
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,Spazkidin3d,3,Sat Jun 6 19:44:29 2015 UTC,are you guys going to go back to sometimes releasing lost episodes sporadically throughout the week? or are you just going to be saving them for fridays from now on
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,legonro,31,Sat Jun 6 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"Lost episodes started out as single topics sliced out of regular episodes, or episodes that were never supposed to see the light of day like the Drunken Idiocy hour, now we sometimes just decide to make them when there's time constraints or some shit"
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,cryburger,6,Sat Jun 6 20:52:10 2015 UTC,There should be a lost episode where everyone talks like a pirate. I gotta say your pirate impression is pretty good.
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,bro9000,-3,Sat Jun 6 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Quick question, how would you say Captain DickHead looks like?"
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,SimonJ57,2,Sun Jun 7 00:11:59 2015 UTC,Captain Dickhead is the Owl.
Sleepycabin,38t9f5,Coyt,9,Sun Jun 7 16:24:22 2015 UTC,I believe that the sleepy gang considers lost episodes to not be that stellar and not as interesting or funny compared to other recordings. But I'm not sure.
Sleepycabin,38y3mt,Dimwit0,3,Sun Jun 7 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Quite a lot of this is answered in their FAQ on Sleepycabin friendo, http://sleepycabin.com/faq/#why  I think the idea was they wanted to take control of their own lives, and not rely on YouTube or Twitch or anything else too heavily.

Sleepycabin,38pxak,skilleon,28,Fri Jun 5 21:58:22 2015 UTC,Don't be offended. This sub is full of assholes trying to be noticed by downvoting anything that isn't directly from the sleepycrew.

Sleepycabin,38pxak,Blackzachattack,2,Fri Jun 5 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand the mentality of a lot of these people.

I don't think alot of these ""youtube celebs"" understand just how much influence they have over young children as the internet is the new babysittter for the shitty parent. Like i said not any of the guy's fault it is just these people are literally a hivemind. tl;dr People are parrots."

Sleepycabin,38rws7,Harmonic_Tonic,12,Sat Jun 6 07:47:34 2015 UTC,"When he says ""Water People"" he means ""hillbillies"" essentially. They probably do some sort of drugs, drink way too much (of what I bet is moonshine), and just live in a place where being an intellectual just isn't that common.

I've got little to no experience with pixel art, so I can't give you exact pointers or technique tips, but I do think Jeff's eyes and eye brows are a tad too small (that is, if you were trying to make a pure pixel art translation of his image. If it's your own idea of what he should look like in pixels, then obviously I have no business saying otherwise). You've left his 5 o'clock shadow out too. So yeah, it's good, but I don't know if I would be able to immediatley pick it out as a pic of Jeff without context."

Sleepycabin,38r3mg,everythingispancakes,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:19:51 2015 UTC,Salts are hard shit but hallucinations have a ot of factors on any drug or even when your sleep deprived. I think some things are universal defaults in our code or maybe there is just something on higher frequency's that influences people who open themselves to such things through sheer desire or by having the mind and body weakened by hard addiction to be influenced by bad things easier.

Sleepycabin,38jij6,quario,13,Thu Jun 4 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"Okay let me tell you a little bit of information here, these are unnecessary and boring.  Having the audio animated implies that there's a story to be told and the animator then shows a visual representation of that story that captivates the audience. Not a bunch or poorly drawn heads with mouths that move every once and a while.  I'm sorry for putting anyone down but when animating try and take chances, go crazy with it and don't limit yourself to lazy tactics such as this. This is coming from a guy who can't draw let alone animate, but I can at least voice my opinion."

I'm gonna be a cunt and drill this in a bit, my storyboards are pretty damn detailed for someone who does it as a hobby, and I'm still embarrassed to post anything remotely unfinished. I don't see how people who barely even move the character and have no sense of blocking a scene feel entitled enough to post their 'I tried' pieces here.   You're better off slapping it on Newgrounds as a swf to save people's bandwidth instead of uploading white space mp4 files to the world, or just practicing alone. You'd really be better off making a 30 second walk cycle as polished as you can. I mean, here, that's what I did.  This isn't meant as hate, it's just really, really unnecessary."

I only ask because the target seems to have changed from only people who just knew about EgoRaptor or Jontron into that general ""video games lets play"" clump."
Sleepycabin,38a9yx,DrDongStrong,10,Wed Jun 3 04:05:57 2015 UTC,"I actually found out about Jon's existence through Grumps. Since then, he's one of my favorite YouTubers, and now I can't stand Grumps. I re-watch some Jon-Era episodes now and then."
Sleepycabin,38a9yx,dylrocks95,2,Thu Jun 4 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"I'm basically the same way, except I saw his Banjo Kazooie video on reddit and discovered him just weeks before game grumps.  So as an already huge fan of ego's stuff growing up, early game grumps was amazing for me.  But I like Dan.  I unsubbed a little while after he came on, but I go back and check them out every now and then.  He seems really chill and I feel like he makes the show more structured, wheris Jon was always singing at random and a little more all over the place.  Which - don't get me wrong - I loved, but I can see how more people may like the 'new' GG.  The dynamic seems a bit more balanced.  All that being said, what /u/DrDongStrong said about now being a  more generic lets play channel is too true.  I don't think GG will ever really go back to that casual feeling of two friends just dicking around playing video games for the hell of it.  All the moments were so much more natural, now it feels like they just say ""look, this guy's like..."" and whatnot because it's some sort of running joke they have to keep up.  There were only a handful of animated bits, and the fandom was so much more closely knit.  Jesus fuck I sound like some sort of lets play hipster.  I don't know, I'm probably just being melodramatic.  It's easy to judge based on nostalgia goggles, but I just kind of wish they ended it before it branched out to all this other shit.  tl;dr I spend way too much of my time idolizing internet animators and shit"

Sleepycabin,37yd5h,thecooleststore,10,Sun May 31 13:01:37 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, personally i really like having the 88 keys. I have a Yamaha CP4 Stage, it was expensive as fuck but I use it all the time and have had no problems with it. It has a tonne of different sounds such as strings, brass, percussion, clav, organs and bla bla bla, the main reason I like the 88 keys is cos I like to do octave bass alot but thats just a personal preference, 61 key pianos are still brilliant and tbh you wont miss the extra keys at all unless you like doing the bass thing."
Sleepycabin,37yd5h,OneysVideoHole,3,Mon Jun 1 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"Fuck, man, that is a seriously sweet keyboard. It's been about 10 years since I stopped playing, so I probably shouldn't be sinking that much into it at this stage, but I'll keep that name in the back of my mind.  Thinking back, most of the pieces I played were usually within 2 octaves of Middle C, so a 61 key would probably suit me just fine for just relearning it, but I may splash out for the extra keys now rather than buying another one once I'm used to playing again and want to play around and do my own stuff.  I've got a few things to think about now, but you really helped. Cheers for replying, dude."
Sleepycabin,37yd5h,ProfessorHugbox,2,Mon Jun 1 09:39:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know what Chris uses, but I'll at least put in my 2 cents.  I personally use a M-Audio keystation 61es. It's a 61 key model, which is just one model lower than a 88 key. I've never missed the extra keys. I've worked with a 49 and it's very doable just not ideal. What I use also is just a midi controller. If Chris only had about a medium to low budget for his equipment I would assume he would have just gotten a midi controller, which might be the case since he went to use another person's piano for the music theory video, but of course I'm not Chris, I don't know.  If anyone's looking to do digital music with a low-medium budget I'd definitely look at midi controllers with a minimum of 49 keys, and semi-weighted keys which most come with now adays. The M-Audio 61es is a great model with weighted keys for pretty cheap."
Sleepycabin,37yd5h,Thejanitor9k,1 point,Sun May 31 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"This, I use a cheap Casio that is 61 keys with a midi and I barely use all the keys. Now if your used to playing a normal piano with weighted keys thats another story but if your short on cash or just want to mess around, a 49 key with a midi is perfect."
Sleepycabin,37yd5h,Fiestu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:43:22 2015 UTC,Also curious. I've been looking at pianos to get when I move into a new place.  YPGs from Yamaha I hear are pretty good.

I was still in high school at the time and I had a crush on this one chick. My best friend at the time said I should totally ask her out, that she was totally available and she's probably interested in me. So I did, and she said yes to my surprise. We were supposed to see Django Unchained but I didn't have my ID on me and I looked too young to get into a solid R movie, so we had to settle on Skyfall. We had a generally fun time watching it, but then I did the cliche arm around the shoulder thing and I could tell she got uncomfortable. I asked her if she minded it and she said no, and then a moment later she said she did and I retreated back. When the movie got out and we were going back home, she had told me she had a boyfriend.

Sleepycabin,37ql5n,kungfukai,2,Sat May 30 00:23:50 2015 UTC,Probably because a lot of straight dudes (myself included) are turned off by Futanari girls.  It's a no brainer really.
Sleepycabin,37ql5n,munujej,5,Sat May 30 02:27:23 2015 UTC,Straight dudes are the primary fans of futa for the record but I agree that it would scare away people who aren't into less vanilla stuff

Sleepycabin,37ql5n,dweengus,5,Sat May 30 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"There's a really good google talk about sexuality and it mentions futa. Basically, because male sexual stimulation is mostly visual, futa tends to be common because it encompasses everything men typically look for. Boobs, curvy hips, butt and a penis (usually your own) are all part of the picture  https://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s"
Sleepycabin,37ql5n,kungfukai,1 point,Sat May 30 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"I've seen other straight dudes use that angle as well, where they project or fantasize themselves being the Futa chick banging all the normal girls.  I understand that angle, I'm just one of those pervs who prefer not to fantasize about futa content.  And then you have all the other stuff like Futa on Futa and Futa on Male stuff, which I honestly think when straight guys think those two themes are still ""straight"" I think they're full of shit and maybe need to think about their own sexuality some more.  Or maybe I'm just super salty that all the good western porn artists primarly do Futa content. Seriously, there's very few good straight/vanilla artists out there and it fucking sucks man."
Sleepycabin,37ql5n,gunwrestling,0,Sat May 30 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"The whole talk is rather interesting - thanks for sharing! I have come across male dominant visual stimulation in my studies the past. It would make sense, considering most porn/hentai caters to men, anyway!  To clarify what I was saying, however, is that categorizing sexualities (i.e. straight, gay, bi) is oversimplifying, whereinfact it exists on a very broad spectrum. I would say it's fallacious thinking to identify with a specific sexuality in that regard.  For example, the speaker explains that consumers of futa are almost exclusively straight men, and that the attraction to that genre is the result of an ""erotic illusion"", but ultimately, there is a sexual draw to the penis regardless of whether they are attracted to any other male features."
Sleepycabin,37ql5n,knocklessmonster,1 point,Sat May 30 06:25:14 2015 UTC,Oh I agree with that. Sexuality is never black and white. I just felt you made a generalization when you said straight dudes don't like that. Some futa fans might not be 100% straight but I think most of them just call themselves and consider themselves straight

Sleepycabin,37x5jg,eureka60,0,Sun May 31 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"This one time when I was 13 my friend was staying the night at my house because my parents were divorcing at the time and everything was a little crazy. Most of the time we spent in my room playing dragonball Z BT3 because we were weaboo fags at the time. But in general everything was going great and for that slim moment I forgot about the whole situation and was happy.  Then after 3 or so hours pass by my father yells out my name in an aggravated tone. I apprehensively went from my room, down the hall, to the living room, just to see my dad standing  there with a distressed look on his face and a knife in his hand.  I of course immediately freaked out, grabbed the home phone and ran back to my room locking the door behind me. After franticly trying to explain the shit that just went down to my friend and calling the police we just climbed out the window and ran to his house.  We laid down in his bed for like 20 minutes before realizing that we left his PS2 over there.....so like a bunch of dumb asses we go back to my homicidal fathers house just to get his PS2. Could have ended badly, as in we could have DIED. God I was stupid.  But after retrieving the PS2 with no problems and running back to his house I realize a slight oversight I made......that being that I never tried to check up on my sister that was in the very next room to me. After crying like a baby in my friends arms assumedly thinking I've killed my sister I run back to my house for a second time and check up on my sister. At this point it's like 2 am, I'm sleep deprived, and I have the mind set that my sister is fucking dead. So you can probably understand that I wasn't really calm or thinking straight.  So I show up to the house to check to see if my sister is alive and it turns out that after hearing the little debacle I had with our dad she locked her door and hid in her closet. I should mention she was 18 at the time so she was smart enough to know that shiz was fucked up yo.  Now when I show up to the house, in my head my father is still IN that house, and my sister is dead. Overcome with rage and sadness I grab a brick from the backyard and climb through my window into the house expecting my dad at the other side of my door. I open my door, brick in hand with an expression on my face that implyed that I was ready to kill, and the police are standing near my sisters door.  I am immediately put into handcuffs and questioned at this point because the police have little to no idea whats really going on, mainly because I didn't really explain much to them. Kind of just panicked and told them to come to my address because someone was trying to kill me.  In the end it seems my dad gave up on the doors (very well built doors by the way, heavy wood and strong bolts luckily) and drove his car to where my mother was staying. He pulled her out of the house she was in, forced her in the car, then tried to chock her to death. Obviously the ""tired"" part implies that he failed in that edevor, which he did, and my mom got away.  My dad later on turned himself into the police, divorced, then moved far away from us. I was so emotionally scared at this point that I didn't go to school for one year because I couldn't talk to anyone but my friend, who was my only friend and best friend at the time.  But years later skipping a shit ton of other near death experiences we get to here. I am 19, employed, and have a happy life with my boyfriend in our house together.  Moral of this story is that if your dad ever tries to kill you with a knife, you should probably run away. Little known fact."

The asdf movie was animated by Edd from eddsworld, im assuming edd did this out of his heart cause he was a nice guy. I might be wrong but im pretty sure tomska doesnt even animate, and just mooches off other peoples hard talent.  And one more note to add to this piece of shit rant, when the featured egoraptor. It played spazkids animation. im out. fuck watchmojo."

Harry Partridge definitely deserves to be up higher in the list, and Zach absolutely should have been included. How the hell did ""HISHE"" get #1? And who was #9 and why does his simplistic animation deserve a higher ranking than Harry's? They hardly didn't even display the animations of Ego's that were his own or of more recent age, and HotDiggedyDemon should have had a position in the ranks there as well. They focused on the random hot meme XD factors, and made a terrible listing. Where was Cory? How about Yotam Perel? UkinoJoe? Mick?

They missed out on so many other great animators like Corey, Zach, Mick,Rubberninja, Pegbarians,etc. They also focused more on how wacky and random the videos were instead of the quality of the animations, which is why fucking Domics and Tomska were higher then Harry Partridge. In a podcast they talked about how easy it is to ignore the amount of time and effort goes into a cartoon, this is a perfect example. They overlook the quality and go for quantity and how funny it is. Fuck this video."

The Nerdist podcast hosts aren't great but they get a huge list of great guests you can look through. Sometimes i listen to the Mega64 podcast but there a little dry/low energy so it's not always entertaining. Bill Burr has a podcast which is pretty funny where he rants to himself.   Theirs a podcast series i listened to way back that was kinda similar made by animators called 'knoxcast' then 'Choas Pony' that had a similiar vibe and i remember it being funny with the Filmcow & knoxkorner guy but it was along time ago so i can't guarantee it'll be that good but it's worth a look it's the closest to Sleepycast i'v heard."

But that was years ago when I was like 16 so I have no idea if they're as good as I remember.   My style of humor has definitively changed since then, mainly because of the fact that I found these weirdos at sleepycabin.  There was a podcast type thing I used to listen to called whachow or something. It had psyguy and crickeydave on it but I can't remember who else. Jontron was on it once which was neat.  Other than that I don't really follow any podcasts. In fact I think the sleepycast podcast is the only one that I've followed this far down the road."

Sleepycabin,36wido,DirtyMikNTheBoys,3,Fri May 22 18:23:14 2015 UTC,I picked up drawing mainly. But i have improved vastly since I started back in February
Sleepycabin,36wido,monkydeeluffy,2,Fri May 22 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"I've tried to pick up drawing, as I've been into drawing ever since I was a kid. However, I have trouble keeping myself motivated and making sure I practice every day."
Sleepycabin,36wido,Parkmayn,2,Sat May 23 02:28:18 2015 UTC,Dude I'm the exact same way. I've been pushing myself to keep practicing now for a month or two and I can see myself improving. That was the thing that always held me back was feeling like I was putting in so much effort and not yielding any results. Ironically that made me not want to draw and not drawing means no improving. I believe they call that a self fulfilling prophecy
Sleepycabin,36wido,nrutas,4,Sat May 23 02:54:09 2015 UTC,I picked up a drawing tablet online and toonboom.  I'm doing it purely as a hobby. Will probly never release anything. The talent pool is just too deep for me to try and jump in.
Sleepycabin,36wido,Haybox123,6,Fri May 22 20:28:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  if you're planning to making animated comedy like the sleepycabin crew,  the animation quality isn't as important as a well written joke.  Look at something like Metal Gear Awesome."
Sleepycabin,36wido,isaywhatiwantyo,3,Fri May 22 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"Release something! Even if it's something simple, it's always a good idea to get your foot in the door."
Sleepycabin,36wido,TARDIS-Engineer,2,Fri May 22 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"Dude Egoraptor's old animations sucked ass (in terms of animation) compared to his more recent animations, just because you aren't talented now doesn't mean you won't get better.  Remember Legendary Frog? Remember how we all thought that was funny because we were in middle school? Legendary Frog was the king of Newgrounds for a little while, and all that shit was just tween-based movement and cheap flash effects. (those were the days, man...) But that shit was great back then.  What I'm saying is that talent grows, but as long as you have the ability to write, whether it be humor or drama or whatever, you'll be able to get better."
Sleepycabin,36wido,fishpickle11,1 point,Sun May 24 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"While I get what you're saying you have to consider that flash animation is waaay different today than it was 11 years ago when those things were big. LegendaryFrog's stuff looked amazing to a lot of people at the time... if you put out animation of that quality now, it just looks weak.  Not to discourage people, it's good to make stuff no matter what but the average animation is a fair bit better these days, in no small part due to improvements in the tools."
Sleepycabin,36wido,caninehere,1 point,Tue May 26 14:15:30 2015 UTC,I think if people started making Legendary Frog animations I would like it because it would remind me of the older times.  I'm gonna go play Stick World now...

Sleepycabin,36veff,Rossandliz,2,Fri May 22 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"In Sleepycabin:   Cory for his fun and exuberant animation style, as well as his consistent lack of a formulaic upbringing in implementing the writing/jokes of each cartoon. Zach for his unique overthetopness in just about every one of his cartoons/animations. It's something that I've yet to find anywhere else, or see effectively replicated by anyone else.  Stamper for his meticulous dedication to preparing the art assets of his cartoons, humor and ability to accent his work by incorporating observations that 90-95% of animators would either not even consider adding or dismiss as immaterial (the fairy wish prince inadvertently poking the kid in the eye and apologizing, the fairy wish prince lifting his tongue up with his mouth open near the end of the video, the wobbling of the marionette puppets' wires in Comme un Poisson, etcetera).

Sleepycabin,36veff,Scollopy,2,Sat May 23 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"Man, ""Akenflips"" really laid it all out pretty well there.  Obviously I'm a fan of the SleepyCabin guys, but I think I'd say my favorite ""internet"" animator is Felix Colgrave.  His stuff just really stands out as unique in just about every way and it's a big influence on my own work.  Probably John K for like 90's or pre-internet animators.  His influence is all over the place in modern cartoons, but I feel like the type of acting in his animation has really been underutilized/underappreciated.  His sense of timing in the way characters interact can make a joke ten times funnier.  I don't have it off-hand, but there was a great gif showing the progression of timing in animation acting from like Steamboat Willie all the way up to John K's Yogi Bear tribute cartoon and it's really cool to see laid out visually."
Sleepycabin,36veff,comradeBodko,1 point,Sat May 23 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you on Felix, it's completely different from what you'd normally associate with internet animation (even though he's done stuff for TV as well)."
Sleepycabin,36veff,catswindler,2,Sat May 23 09:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has similarly unusual timing to John K.  He's posted a few things talking about how the art style should inform the way things move and all that, really interesting.  But you know, it's really cool to see anything that different from the ""thick line, wacky faces"" style that's so common in internet animation lately.  Not that it's as bad as the Pixar style in 3d or anything, but it does seem like people fall back on it a little too much, myself included."
Sleepycabin,36veff,HEISENBERGxBLUE,1 point,Sat May 23 19:45:48 2015 UTC,Recently for me it has been Mr. Chambers and Catfat. Chambers for his weirdly awesome style and Catfat because his animation is just gorgeous and flowy.

I don't remember clearly if he said the update was supposed to be coming soon or not, though. He's mentioned Hellbenders a few times either in livestreams or on twitter, so I'd expect some kind of update about it, maybe soon, maybe not so soon, but it's coming, nonetheless."

I cant wait for hellbenders, gonna be so sick and hope Zach eventually gets to guest write for Rick and Morty or something."
Sleepycabin,36oshj,Kony2012IsRelevant,30,Wed May 20 23:04:59 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day we're not politicians, so I think it wouldn't be too wise to press something like that into a comedy format. When we do chime in on something more serious, like religion, politics, science, etc, it's something we know at least a little bit about. I specifically try to avoid answering a question if it's about a subject I know little to nothing about.  Plus, we try to keep our answers snappy. Something like politics requires constant self clarification and refinement, something that does not translate well to an off-the-cuff podcast format. Rather, a discussion on religion, politics, or anything serious requires very deliberate and meticulous planning and research to be ultimately duked out by the greatest minds each field has to offer.   ...And we're a couple of dudes who draw shit and drink beer.   All that said, we'll certainly continue to chime in on something serious when it's appropriate. As for expecting us to dedicate more than the occasional comment on something like politics, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you by saying I don't think that will ever be a possibility.  Thanks for the question!"

Sleepycabin,36kvpl,Alfrottos,9,Wed May 20 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"Animation isn't just limited to the sites you listed. You could also be a freelance animator, or try to get in with a studio. I believe in the most recent episode they said that youtube is now more suited towards building a portfolio then it is to make a living. That's why the Cabin members don't really post things to youtube anymore; Stamper works primarily on voice work and writing, Jeff has been working on Game 4 with The Behemoth and Stamper, Chris and Zach are working on Hellbenders (and it's an actual contract job, which is why Chris moved to the States), and Cory's been doing art for Shad and his site. Niall hasn't really been part of the Internet machine for very long, but he does art comissions instead of animation.  tl;dr do it because you love it, and if you make animations for youtube, vimeo, etc., treat it more as a portfolio instead of a means of living.     Edit: Since you're young, I would say to start posting to specifically newgrounds now and get feedback on how to improve (they're usually really good at giving honest critique). As you work more and more you'll get the technical stuff down easily. You could also save up some money and get a cheap/used drawing tablet to get started (there's some decent ones on Amazon around $50 that average about 4-star reviews).  Edit 2 (last one I swear): I know the crew members have also talked up and down about college and how ""useless"" it is, but it's honestly not a bad idea if it won't ruin you financially, i.e. if you qualify for financial aid or if you/your parents have enough money to pay for it. You just do not want to pay for it 100% with loans, otherwise you're totally fucked. Businesses will always prefer people with degrees, no matter how skilled you are. You could even do community for a couple of years while working a job, so that when you transfer you'll have enough to help you through University."
Sleepycabin,36kvpl,goochmaster5,1 point,Wed May 20 03:53:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this.  Give it a try and see if it's something you really enjoy doing.  Any kind of art as a career is going to be really tough; it's pretty difficult to get a job at a studio or make it as a freelancer these days, but if it's really what you want to do and you can handle everything that comes with it, go for it.  Newgrounds is great for the community and everything, but I'd say feel free to upload everywhere you said.  You never know if somebody might stumble across it.  As far as using youtube as a ""portfolio,"" that isn't really something that's done in the industry.  Which is to say, professional animators typically make a demo reel of their best work lasting no more than a couple minutes at most.  No potential employer is going to sift through multiple videos.  I think what the guys meant more on the podcast when they mentioned that is that youtube is a fairly easy-to-use, accessible place to put up your work.  Regarding the college thing, you really need to be careful about that.  If you're a self-motivated person and can learn things on your own, I would recommend not going to college for art.  Maybe attend some figure drawing classes, but that's about it.  The exception would be not only if you can go for minimal cost, but if you can go to a really good school where you'd actually have networking opportunities.  Meeting people in your industry is about half the value of college, and if you're going to one that barely has a presence you're missing out."
Sleepycabin,36kvpl,comradeBodko,4,Wed May 20 07:45:30 2015 UTC,"Just post your first batch of stuff on Newgrounds, people are usually pretty easy going so don't be afraid to post anything. After you get good at animating, post only your top-tier stuff on your youtube page so when people look up your portfolio of work they see only good stuff and not the horrible things you did when you started."

People need to understand that the world is not tailored to everyone's needs separately. If something I see personally offends me, I don't really mind because I know there will be at least a handful of people who are okay with it. I just either tend to ignore it or skip over it, not write an angry email about how much it hurt my fee-fees"
Sleepycabin,36gbff,wombatcubes,-2,Wed May 20 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"People who get offended too easily are just weak minded. They don't have the power to just get over something so they moan and cry about such little things to make them feel like they have some sort of meaning. That's why I don't go near tumblr, spend about an hour browsing through r/tumblrinaction and you will see how deluded people are. On another note, I hear people saying that ""cis"" people are horrible, mostly by ""trans"" people. I have no fucking idea what a trans person is, and why these people need to ""identify as"" something. Bunch of weak minded weeboos."
Sleepycabin,36gbff,Rossandliz,1 point,Tue May 19 09:00:22 2015 UTC,"People have all the right in the world to be offended, you aren't going to change their mind and there is no sense ridiculing them for it. For example say someone was offended by a 9/11 joke, maybe someone close to them was lost that day, you can't just tell them to ""get over"" the loss of a loved one. People are always going to be offended by something, but that doesn't mean they're wrong.  That being however, doesn't mean people should censor themselves just to appeal to those who are offended. Jokes about things that may be found offensive are A-OK as long as they are just that, jokes, and don't carry any malicious intent."

The most unnerving, by far, however, is my recollection of finding this scene in Ed, Edd n Eddy arousing... Man, what was wrong with kid me?"

Sleepycabin,36cag5,weedgenie,9,Mon May 18 08:38:58 2015 UTC,"My advice for medium sized chats, which are still good but have a considerable amount of spam/idiots in it, is get BetterTTV and put like 90% of the emotes on your keyword blacklist. No one who uses a Kappa, OpieOP, Kreygasm, or the disgustingly annoying DansGame will be saying anything worth reading, I promise you. It also makes the chat a lot slower and readable too because it filters out all the messages with Kappas which account for probably half of all messages."

Sleepycabin,36cag5,legonro,5,Mon May 18 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't like fun, it's just that I have been watching twitch streams since twitch first became a thing. After almost a million Kappas it becomes really fucking annoying to even look at. Also the emotes aren't funny, they actually detract from the funniness of a comment. Trust me, I used to embrace even the most spammy of chats, like 20K+ viewer chats with no slow-mode or subscriber-only, just pure chaos, but like I said after a while it becomes real annoying."
Sleepycabin,36cag5,McDeely,1 point,Mon May 18 20:46:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually agree. The nature of a twitch chat with over a certain amount of viewers doesn't really make sense to have a slow and thought provoking chat group.

If it gets removed I'm not upset, I still have it on my computer and watch it from time to time for a laugh."
Sleepycabin,36adey,isaywhatiwantyo,-7,Sun May 17 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never saw the original either, just heard the song and thought to do this."
Sleepycabin,36adey,Kaephoon,3,Sun May 17 20:50:38 2015 UTC,lol
Sleepycabin,36adey,Zinko999,7,Mon May 18 15:28:42 2015 UTC,Wasn't it originally uploaded like this before it got taken down?
Sleepycabin,36adey,HighlordSmiley,-4,Sun May 17 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but it's up again now I guess until they take it down again"
Sleepycabin,36adey,HighlordSmiley,3,Sun May 17 19:57:37 2015 UTC,Aaaaaaaand It's gone
Sleepycabin,36adey,dweengus,2,Sun May 17 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"The original video was exactly like this. Oney and Zach dubbed it over the actual video of the scene, but it was removed due to them using the movie's assets, as Spazkid said. So yeah, you essentially just uploaded what they did."

Sleepycabin,368bj7,McMeanface,4,Sun May 17 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"Basically, a bunch of cool guys from all over the place came together to Pennsylvania to start SleepyCabin so they could collaborate in animations and other projects. Soon after the office was set, they started the podcast which brought lots of attention to SleepyCabin. There isn't a whole lot more to it than that I think. The only real filler is the fun stories they tell on the podcast.  Happy listening, and have fun on your trip!"
