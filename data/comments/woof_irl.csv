woof_irl,3dywhf,aking14,8,Mon Jul 20 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"The video behind this gif really bothers me.  The dog is blind and the lady is yelling at the dog ""warmer"", ""cold"", and ""hot"" to try to guide it to the ball.  The problem is that the dog is clearly using sound and smell to find the ball, and not her yelling cues.  Maybe I'm just a grouch, but the whole thing just irks me.  It comes off as a ""look how well I've trained my dog"" thing when the dog is totally finding the ball on its own and ignoring the lady."

But the dog's teeth go into the kids face. Like his top row of teeth grab the upper half of the kids right cheek, and the dog's lower row of teeth land on the kids underdeveloped jaw bone. When the dogs teeth grip into his jaw bone it snaps the bone into nine different pieces. And then when the father realizes his child is being eaten, he drops the camera and runs to protect his son. The dog quickly turns and like growls at him or some shit and the dads like ""shit dude calm down man i dont want any trouble"" and the dogs like ""BAAAH FUCK MAN BAAAH GRAAAAAWRRR"" and then the dog runs away with the kid on his back, still bleeding out of his chin hole. but the kid is still totally alive. because you know that whole bite situation was gross but it totally wouldn't kill him. he's probably unconscious and all that because of the pain."

woof_irl,383bwb,Moosekababs,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Marnie was a street dog living in Connecticut. In August 2012, Marnie was moved to an animal shelter by animal control and was nicknamed Stinky due to her pungent smell from living on the street. She had health problems, such as decaying teeth, partial visual impairment in her left eye, and partial hearing impairment before Marnie's adoption. Although Marnie's decaying teeth were removed and Marnie's vision was gradually restored, Marnie's hearing impairment still remains."

woof_irl,36eztt,ICaughtTheUgly,11,Tue May 19 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"And evrytime someone says this, the reply is the same: it's perfectly normal, the dog was just sleeping and was startled, he isn't being territorial and he isn't aggressive, he was just startled. It's probably the first nd last time this happened."
woof_irl,36eztt,Arkhonist,7,Tue May 19 10:49:20 2015 UTC,"My dog gets jumpy while sleeping too, but when he notices he just barked/snarled at me, he gets all apologetic. He's a goofball."

I thought maybe the dog's paw was under the pillow, – it wasn't.   I've never had a dog in the house, my grandparents owned one and me and my parents visited them frequently. But despite this, I think the dog's reaction is just beyond what I'd normally expect: a weary protective look at the child."
woof_irl,36eztt,WinterholdMage,0,Tue May 19 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this.  I've seen this gif before and it makes me upset that the dog is being allowed around this child at all.  If the dog is aggressive that's fine, it happens for a number of reasons.  But the simple fact it's being allowed so close to a child is just unacceptable."
woof_irl,36eztt,TheSwefrican,7,Tue May 19 06:04:17 2015 UTC,"My dog is the sweetest, cuddliest little guy you have ever met. He loves people, cuddles gladly with kids, and is just derpy happy. But even he jumps up in fright if I suddenly touch him while sleeping. It's not aggression, it's initial, split second instinct for self preservation. Notice how the dog immediately changes expression when he sees it's the kid? There's zero aggression, zero lunging forward. It's no different to a person being startled awake and trying to punch their ""attacker"". Same concept."
