Needing to gain weight in order to qualify for a life insurance policy, his doctor simply prescribed beer.  “At first Heber found beer ‘bitter and distasteful’…but he quickly acquired both a business and a personal taste for it. Within a year, he secured the fire insurance business of most Salt Lake City saloons and Utah breweries, an additional ten pounds, and a growing relish for the savor of hops. His daily four-glass limit became five, and occasionally grew to six.”  In time, however, young Heber began to “war[] with his acute sense of conscience” and resolved to stop drinking. - See more at: http://www.dovesandserpents.org/wp/2014/03/heber-j-grant-beer-and-sexual-morality/#sthash.S9NYTChI.dpuf   The WoW was only made temple mandatory because it was the only way Heber thought he could force himself to stop breaking it."

mormon,3e2nik,mormbn,19,Tue Jul 21 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"President Peterson explained that too often we say of returned missionaries, “Oh, he’ll be back to normal soon.” Quoting Elder Shayne M. Bowen, President Peterson explained, “If normal is what they were like before, I hope that they are never normal again.”  “If you forget what you learned on your mission, what was the point? The fact is that the mission is the MTC for the rest of your life. The mission shouldn’t stand out as a unique opportunity. It just prepares us for everything else we have to do.”   This is insane.  This guy is either incredibly naive or he is purposely missing the point.   A lot of times RMs come back as ignorant and incredibly passionate ass holes with no sense of boundaries or social skills.   They've been living in a bubble and they think they are grown up.   They only know how to talk to people like they are targets.  EDIT:  And he's asking what the point of a mission is if you forget what you learned.  He's confirming that missions are for the missionaries and not for those they teach."

Of course they are going to be different. They're (hopefully) more mature and have gained some experience.  They still need to find a new normal. Missionary life is extreme in a lot of ways, and many of the things they're supposed to do now (like dating, or even going to the store without a companion) are completely foreign to them."

A mission was the exact opposite of this every day.  I never needed to plan for the future, I did one thing every day all day.  If showing up on time to appointments is your view of 'scheduling your life' well.... missions are 'scheduling your life' on the easiest difficulty possible.   Highschool was more complicated than a mission.     are put on a budget   Mehhh, I never had to worry about the budget.  The only thing I had to budget was food, which didn't require an actual budget.     I didn't have to budget fuel, or car expenses, or rent, or other travel, or my cell phone, or insurance, or 401k etc.. etc....   It was just food and the amount of money we had was way more than we ever needed.   There were missionaries on my mission that would spend their food money on new electronics because they had so much excess food budget, a missionary in my last area bought a 1500 dollar laptop right before he went home with his food budget.    I ended the mission with over 500 dollar in the food budget and it just swepped back to the mission when i went home.   We ate out several times a week and on p-days we would go to the mall and buy small things like CDs.     Dependency was what I learned on my mission.  There was only ever one thing that I had to focus on as a missionary, who am I going to talk to about the church today.   Most days were just riding  my bike or driving my car around the city as I hopped from appointment to appointment.   Mission life was life on easy mode (assuming you enjoyed the work, which at the time I did).    I was told where to live and who to live with for two years.  I didn't have to worry about socializing, school, work, rent, family, vacation, savings/investing, other bills, etc... etc....   I learned how to cook 3 meals on my mission but mostly just ate easy stuff I could pop in the oven or microwave but more often then not ate out really nice food or with members that always went over the top for us.   The only life skills I learned were how to feed myself cereal each morning and door to door sales in hot weather."

It was a limited practice that was put in place when the pioneers came west and was safeguarded and only practiced by a small percent of the people. Everything Joseph did before polygamy was great, but now he's a fallen prophet. Joseph Smith only had sex with a select few of his polygamous wives, and none his wives who were also married to other men. Joseph Smith actually fought polygamy, the LDS practice of polygamy was instituted by Brigham Young who had picked it up during his mission to the Cochranites. Why would you complain about Joseph Smith practicing polygamy? An angel with a sword commanded him to do it, and anything that God commands is good. He didn't practice polygamy, he practiced polygyny. He had some wives that God had given him, and all righteous men will be polygamous in the next life."

mormon,3dyw8l,corbantd,6,Tue Jul 21 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"Here is an article from the Ensign that very clearly points to the parts of the D&C where Joseph claims it was inspired.  This took me exactly 10 seconds of googling to find.  If you are an active member you should have been reading your doctrine and covenants and this should have been in your knowledge base.    Joseph Smith did not take it upon himself to revise and translate the Bible; he was commanded and appointed by the Lord to do the work. On March 7, 1831, he was instructed by revelation to begin the translation of the New Testament:  “And now, behold, I say unto you, it shall not be given Unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known;  “Wherefore, I give unto you that ye may now translate it, that ye may be prepared for the things to come.” (D&C 45:60–61.)  And nearly a year later, on February 16, 1832, he recorded the following:  “For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John. …” (D&C 76:15. Italics added.)  Later his work of translating the record of the prophets (Old Testament) and the apocrypha was spoken of in Doctrine and Covenants 90:13 and 91:1–6. [D&C 90:13; D&C 91:1–6]  It is evident that the Prophet himself regarded his work of translating the Bible to be divinely inspired and an important part of his ministry, for on December 1, 1831, at Hiram, Ohio, he recorded this statement in his journal:  “I resumed the translation of the Scriptures, and continued to labor in this branch of my calling with Elder Sidney Rigdon as my scribe. …” (DHC, vol. 1, p. 238.)"
mormon,3dyw8l,HighPriestofShiloh,0,Tue Jul 21 00:42:34 2015 UTC,An inspired translation doesn't necessarily mean a more technically precise translation. It means a more spiritually correct and complete translation.

It means a more spiritually correct and complete translation.   Exactly. The whole point of the original post (and the website) were that Joseph Smith (among others) claimed the JST was restoring original text. I just want to know where he made that claim, or even where the church has specifically taught that.  I don't deny that he and/or others may have claimed the translation to be inspired or a better translation. But that's not the same as saying it was a restoration.  I fully agree that the Pericope Adulterae wasn't part of the original Gospel of John. Anybody who has engaged in minimal amount of academic study of the Bible knows that. But that doesn't mean that the story wasn't inspired."
mormon,3dyw8l,sandyguy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"Did you actually read my website, though? Here's a few paragraphs from my website:   Finally, the following quote is taken from a 1982 Ensign article (https://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/07/plain-and-precious-things-restored?lang=eng) which again explains that the purpose of the JST was to correct scribal additions and alterations in order to restore the Bible to its original form.  “The message of 1 Nephi 13:20–39 [1 Ne. 13:20–39] and Moses 1:40–41 is that vital material was taken from the Bible before the manuscripts available to us today were written. The JST was to be a divinely appointed revelatory process restoring information that had been lost from all biblical texts….As indicated earlier, the Prophet Joseph Smith corrected many passages as they currently stand in the King James Version and other versions of the Bible; he also introduced into the biblical record many doctrinal and historical concepts that are not in any of the versions of the Bible known to mankind. Joseph Smith explained that he believed the Bible as it “came from the pen of the original writers,” but that “ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors.” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1938, p. 327.) He also stated that “many important points touching the salvation of men, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled.” (Teachings of the Prophet, p. 10.) This is the same position presented in 1 Nephi 13:20–40, Moses 1:40–41, and the eighth article of faith. [1 Ne. 13:20–40;Moses 1:40–41; A of F 1:8] In view of these premises, we may view the JST as being, at least in part, a restoration of lost material—material once known to the ancient prophets but then lost, material now made known again in these last days through the Prophet Joseph Smith.”"

What I question is that authoritative claims were made that those purported revelations were for the purpose of restoring original text."

mormon,3dybmh,sirmisterchris,8,Mon Jul 20 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"A while ago I watched a programme on the UK's Channel 4, which was a documentary about being a Mormon missionary in England.   It's called Meet the Mormons for anyone wishing to check it out."
mormon,3dybmh,CultZero,6,Mon Jul 20 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"Is there more of a conscious effort to promote the religion in Ireland?   Not that I am aware of. However, the church did fairly recently lower the age that people can serve missions, which has lead to an increase in missionaries everywhere. It could also be a coincidence/confirmation bias, I guess. Or the local mission may have moved its headquarters there, so you see more missionaries going to and from the office.    For those of you who were missionaries, did you find the experience negative, or did the homesickness et cetera wear off after a short while?   I saw the documentary as well. No, it does not really match my experience, but I am sure it does for some. I was never really homesick, but I lived away from home a lot before I served my mission. I imagine that for many young kids who have never been away from home for more than a weekend or so, it can be a bit of a shock to the system. I observed several missionaries who were quite homesick early on their mission, but for all of them, it did soon wear off.   There were certainly bad days and weeks and at times I got discouraged, but, generally speaking, I enjoyed my mission quite a bit. It was very fulfilling to be on the ground every day working with individuals that I would have never come across in my life, feeling like I was really making a difference to other people.   Stepping way outside of your comfort zone, is hard to be sure, but I also think that doing so is the way to find the most fulfillment in life (this is not just specific to missions, but general life advice). It is the most effective way to learn, grow, and to really understand yourself."
mormon,3dybmh,everything_is_free,5,Mon Jul 20 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"The homesickness depends a lot on the missionary's personality and his/her experiences prior to their mission.  I had spent summers away from home in high school and did a semester of college before serving.  I was fine in the MTC(missionary training center) for the 2 months I was there.  Then I arrived in the Philippines and I felt a strong culture shock that lasted for about a month.  I did miss my family, but more than that I was just having a hard time adjusting to the living conditions, new culture, foreign language, etc.   Once I learned to start talking to people I came to love them and I really enjoyed my mission.  The Filipino people are awesome, the language was really fun to speak, and there were all kinds of exciting new experiences.  Coming home was harder than going out for me."
mormon,3dybmh,bjacks12,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"The homesickness and isolation were most acute in the first couple weeks, while I was in the missionary training center.  They faded a bit after I got to my mission area (Bracknell, UK).  The hard part was just the daily grind of constant rejection.  Waking up and facing a day of knocking on doors is really hard after doing the same thing for the previous 99 days."

In other words, they teach how to be saved: that it requires obtaining an assurance from God that you will be saved, and any hope of salvation without that assurance is vain hope (Lecture 6).    This version of soteriology, undeniably what Joseph Smith believed and taught, has completely dropped off the belief map endorsed by correlation. You will still find oblique references to the possibility of obtaining an assurance from God that you are saved, but ignoring the Lectures on Faith allows us to believe it is a special privilege, not an absolute necessity."

mormon,3dv0zr,amertune,8,Mon Jul 20 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"In response to the meat portion to the Word of Wisdom, this needs to be taken in historical context. When that revelation was given, many of the saints lived in poor conditions where crop yield was uncertain. Sometimes if yield was low, they would eat an unhealthy proportion of meat because it was more convenient or consistent than crops. This was Heavenly Father's way of nudging them to try to keep a balanced diet before they even knew what a balanced diet was. As food preservation techniques improved--namely refrigeration--this wasn't as much of an issue because it introduced more variety to their diets.  So today we should still exercise moderation (as with everything else), but it's not quite the same because there probably are few people in the world who rely solely on meat for their survival."

If the comma is wrong in verse 13, and the verse really means that meat should be eaten all year round and not just in times of need, then why would verse 15 be repeating the idea that animals should only be eaten in times of famine and hunger? (The verse is actually a little unclear... it could be saying that grains should only be eaten in times of famine and hunger, though that would be a ridiculous interpretation)  I think that JST Genesis 9:11 is also relevant:   11 And surely, blood shall not be shed, only for meat, to save your lives; and the blood of every beast will I require at your hands.

For instance, this post on r/lds a few weeks ago when gay marriage was legalized across the US: The New Old Mormon Controversy of Polygamy  That view could be supported by what Bruce R. McConkie wrote in his book Mormon Doctrine   In the early days of this dispensation, as part of the promised restitution of all things, the Lord revealed the principle of plural marriage to the Prophet. Later the Prophet and leading brethren were commanded to enter into the practice, which they did in all virtue and purity of heart despite the consequent animosity and prejudices of worldly people. After Brigham Young led the saints to the Salt Lake Valley, plural marriage was openly taught and practiced until the year 1890. At that time conditions were such that the Lord by revelation withdrew the command to continue the practice, and President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto directing that it cease. (Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, pp. 213-218.) Obviously the holy practice will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium. (Isa. 4.)"

[Eight Witnesses' statement]: ""...And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken."" Smith's claims are walking a tight rope between scientific and magical thinking. If one loses balance, the scientific method that requires proof and hard evidence is the first resort, as Mr. Smith attempted to do with his 11 witnesses.  Black and white thinking: The scientific method and mormonism are wholly incompatible. The creation according to science and Smith's variant, based on Genesis, are independent, non-overlapping narratives. Moving to a more metaphorical space is extremely difficult because of the basic premises built into mormonism. The scientific method overcomes suspension of disbelief by proof, observation, and experiment. Religion relies on suspension of disbelief as a basic principle: faith.  Black and white thinking: Some religions have begun moving to a more metaphorical space. Mormonism's extra truth claims change the definition of faith to include not only things which one hopes to be true, but cannot be proven, but it now also requires the membership to believe things that science states are impossible: the timeline presented in D&C 77 and at LDS.org; single creation events by species vs. evolution by natural selection; Smith's ""translation"" does not correspond to Egyptologist's translation; the Book of Abraham's physics of star light vs. nuclear fusion reactions produced under massive gravitational pressure.  Black and white thinking: Occams razor states that solutions to problems shouldn't be more complex than necessary. Also known as the law of parsimony, the solution which provides a solution with the fewest assumptions is best. Mormon apologists add cycles and epicycles to the problem.  Nuanced thinking/partial belief: Cafeteria mormons pick and choose among those doctrines which are important to them. When pressed about whether they believe a specific doctrine, the faithful may hedge a bit. Most often they will veer back into the same ruts of fundamental orthodoxy, especially if it is part of the core doctrine. There are many things the faithful will hold up as not being essential to their testimony. Figuring out what is core for each person is difficult and often a moving target.   Nuanced thinking/political activism: Many believe that the church is not perfect and could be better if it did some things differently. For example, if they allowed for more nuanced beliefs, gave women the priesthood, and allowed full participation for LGBT persons including temple marriage. Those who preach too far outside of the correlated manuals will eventually be corrected; if they persist then they will be disciplined. Kate Kelly, John Dehlin, Kristy Money have been disciplined. No doubt, there will be many more to come.  Cynical thinking/cognitive dissonance: Believers may become aware that mormonism's truth claims cannot stand up under scrutiny of the scientific examination. Instead of facing reality, they suppress the facts that do not match their previous indoctrination, embedded deeply in their subconscious. Sunk costs, potential loss of social standing in the community and loss of family relationships add to the inertia that keeps members parroting belief in the doctrine, especially at critical moments.  Mathematical thinking/game theory/political maneuvering: Children and those financially dependent on others are often coerced into attending and feigning belief. If they don't go along with maximum participation, including missions, temple marriage, accepting every calling, then their food, shelter, education, and future career goals may be put at risk. Free agency in mormonism is a non-sequitur. Adults who lose faith risk losing their entire family and everything invested so far: spouse, children, house, extended family, employment and social standing in predominantly mormon communities. The church itself will often play the card to those wavering in their faith, ""Nice family you've got there! It would be a shame if anything were to happen to it."" Many will weigh that decision and the costs of rocking the boat vs. simply continuing on. Those who feign belief are free to adopt whatever level of public orthodoxy they want: from Jack mormon to cafeteria mormon to fundamentalist. Who is to know? Mind reading devices have not been invented, as of yet.  Mathematical thinking/Pascal's Wager/Fear of the unknown: This goes along with the sunk cost fallacy. Members of earlier generations believed scientific proof of their religion was on the verge of being discovered, especially in Central America. When definitive proof was found, then missionary work would really take off and the gospel would roll forth unto the entire world. Those hopes have not been realized and appear to be highly unlikely to ever be reconcilled with provable migration patterns, technological capabilities of native Americans, and proposed timelines. The faithful proceed to pay their 10% on the gross (or on their social security checks.) Their ""eternal families"" are held at ransom. They, they've paid their ante and now they're going to play out the game until the finish to see if they win the celestial lottery."

mormon,3dsc60,michaelsfarrens,5,Sun Jul 19 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how you explain the following:   Studies of intercessory prayer show no effect of prayer on the health of patients.  In The Most Correct Religion Survey people were asked what answer they received when they prayed and asked God which religion was the most correct: 82% of the respondents received an answer to their prayer. 71% of those received an answer by feelings (other answers included hearing voices, seeing visions, and dreams). A total of 22 different religions were identified as being the religion that God told them was the most correct. This survey asked people to pray about whether God approved of gay marriage. The answers people received conflicted and came out nearly 50/50 despite 67% of the respondents being “certain” they received an answer to their prayer and 95% being at least “fairly sure” that they had received an answer.  This website contains the testimonies of people from many different religions. Many of the testimonies relate experiences of praying, feeling/experiencing something, and interpreting that to be an answer from God that their religion is the most correct. And this video includes testimonies of religious people who believe their feelings have indicated that they've found truth. It includes mainstream religions and some cults too. Also some Mormon break-off religions."

But if you are outside the view of Christianity and the power of God and prayer, we need to start at teaching u the gospel. Then when you're a Christian I'll help you out with prayer as thought in the bible. God would will that I pray for your salvation first. That's what I'll do. God bless you."
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"Your article seems to only cite bible verses as its sources. Why do you believe those bible verses are accurate?  I used to be a Christian but realized that there is insufficient evidence to believe many of the claims of the Bible. I also realized from links like the ones I posted that prayer is neither an effective way to learn truth nor a way by which people are healed. But, as always, I am open to considering new evidence and arguments, so I look forward to your response."
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of evidence. Just some are not able to believe by Gods grace and some are. That's in the bible too. Also you can't lose your salvation. You are either called or not. God doesn't grant salvation and then take it. I pray you take more time looking.   The Bible is Gods Word, holy and perfect, as stated in the Bible. Common understanding among most Christians throughout history. You can go to gty.org and get some good lessons/sermons on any of these topics if you really feel like seeking them out.   In the article I cover how healings aren't Gods prerogative most of the time. Read through it quickly so I don't end up writing it all over on this reply. Lol. I'm at work on break on the iPad.   Thanks. Got to get back in. Don't have verses handy. Sorry."
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of evidence.   Would you mind sharing what you believe to be the strongest evidence? What evidence convinces you that the supernatural claims in the bible are true? The biggest concerns I have are the fact the gospels weren't written by eyewitnesses, were written by anonymous authors, were written decades after the events they describe, were authored in a magical-thinking-pre-science-era by biased believers that Jesus was divine, the original writings have been lost, and so our earliest copies are hundreds of years after the events occurred, and that we're generally suspicious of supernatural claims.   The Bible is Gods Word, holy and perfect, as stated in the Bible.   Is that the evidence you're referring to? The Bible is true because the Bible says it's true? That's circular reasoning. We could similarly establish that the Quran is true because it says it's true.    But if you aren't open, than it doesn't matter what anyone says.   Yes, I agree. And I assume you're also open to the possibility that the Bible's supernatural claims aren't true and that there isn't a god who answers prayers, right? You're open to that possibility but have been convinced by the evidence that there is a God answering prayers, is that a fair statement?  I look forward to your responses about my links. Thanks."
mormon,3dsc60,curious_mormon,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"You are also going off topic of prayer that is in the article. It's purpose, Gods will, and miracles. Read the article. Look and listen to the links. If you are just interested in discussing Gods existence that's another topic. That is resolved between you seeking and Him calling. Having to explain so much shows you don't really care. You have to start caring first (seeking). A valid prayer (the topic) would be for a person to read and understand the gospel of Jesus and accept his sacrifice. Beyond that, you're on your own."

mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"Seeking in the Bible is responding to God's call and desiring to learn the Gospel. I have some other links there that aren't Bible verses in the article. There are links to gty.org on prayer, but they also have resources for the other questions that you have. I think they would do much better job apologizing those subjects than I would. I think my role at this stage is to point you in the right direction to your questions. I feel confident on the topic of prayer, but those bigger questions you are asking I am not going to debate. I think it would be more appropriate to use the resources at grace to you (GTY.org). I just know that they would do a much better job at doing it. I have enjoy all the studying in the Bible that I do, but teaching at this stage is not something I would want to mess up. If you are seeking out than you know that the stakes are high. I just don't want to do you a disservice.   Christianity isn't a religion. We like to steer clear of that word. Unlike religions of the world, you don't have to do anything for salvation. Just accept what is already guaranteed.  One thing I have realized in this discussion is how people define the words we are using often. Prayer & Christian. I think there can be confusion if we mistake each others definitions. You can see in the article how prayer in the Bible differs from what many people consider prayer to be, or what its main purposes are. I think we actually agree a lot about that. Being a Christian can be a deceiving term. The Bible teaches that accepting Jesus as your savior and that the gospel (Birth, life, death and resurrection) are true. It also states that you have to believe in the God and Jesus of the Bible. Many groups/religions throughout history distort what is in the Bible. Add doctrine, customs, laws, works, etc. that the Bible forbids. But God keeps his church in tact by various means. Canonization of the Bible is one. Also, over and over large movements have sought out to keep the Bible and Church pure. Thats where you have guys like Calvin, Luther, the Puritans, etc. Though they aren't perfect by any means, they kept the church what it has always been, as God dictates in His revelation, the Bible. We see from the letters in the Bible that these issues were also concerning to the first century church. One of the Devils greatest works is to weaken the church, pervert doctrine, deceive people into following falsities and making the world think that is what Christianity is.   Well I've said too much already. Check out the site. Great ministry. If you are seeking out Gods truth, and you realize how important it is to try, you should find everything you need there. (second to the Bible). My email should be on my blog. You can email me questions about anything. I'll do whatever I can to answer.     I am sorry. I have my parents in town and am getting off a 12 hour shift. I will not be able to properly look at your links. (Without sacrificing time with my kids and wife and parents). I just don't want to be distracted. I will as soon as I can.   I have a crazy schedule and that's why I turned here to talk about these things. So I am very happy that I get to. I remember most discussions that I had with people when I was not a Christian and how I was able to call them up when God decided it was time to listen. Even as stubborn as I was. (As most of you guys are. lol) I really appreciate your time."

mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, didn't want to let you all the way down. Stayed up a bit longer.   Agree - Prayers in this age have no miraculous healing effect. Healings were done in the apostolic age in order to confirm Jesus' deity and the apostles authenticity. This is a common understanding within the Christian Church. As the apostles died and no one qualified was left (witness to resurrection) the church age began, as tough in many of the letters, elders/bishop/pastors (words for the same thing interchanged in the NT) took over heading the churches (gatherings of believers for teaching, singing and the breaking of bread(eating and hanging out)) Not sure on all those denominations, but as I mention in super post, probably about 21ish of those people are Christian. Knowing the God in the Bible and who Jesus is and what the Gospel is, is necessary for salvation. Can't be a Christian if you got a false God right? Visions, voices and maybe even feelings aren't Biblical forms of salvation. Best use GTY for more on that. The Strange Fire Conference discusses a lot of that. You don't need prayer to answer this. The Bible is a revelation of God. (His Word is Holy, God Breathed, used for instruction, rebuke and teaching, etc. Pretty clear on sexual sins of all sorts. Don't have enough time tonight to give you a good answer. There was a lot to read, not enough time tonight. The Bible is clear though on what the purpose of the Holy Spirit is and how it relates to conversion and its deity. More really good stuff on the Holy Spirit at GTY. Have I mentioned GTY? Ditto Answer - Didn't get that far into it though. Ill finish it tomorrow I think. Parent are going back.    Try to meet me half way in looking into this stuff. Plus if you end up believing you get to sing cool hymnals!!"
mormon,3dsc60,mostlypertinant,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:45 2015 UTC,"Cool, we're just about on the same page there, then. But I'm curious why you believe the biblical accounts of the apostolic and Jesus healings. Why do you believe those accounts in the bible are accurate? (And if you don't have time to answer this question I understand, I have kids of my own!). Roughly 14 of the 22 could be considered ""Christian"" in the broadest sense. Many people would deny that Mormons, 7th Day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses are Christians. And 22 is not the number of people, by the way, that's just the number of religions that were identified. There were 114 usable responses by people. You go on to mention that everyone is saved, which is fine but not relevant to my concern I don't think. My concern is that this survey seems to indicate that the tool of praying, feeling/experiencing something, and then interpreting that feeling/experience to be an answer from God does not seem to yield reliable results. Because the ""answers"" people are receiving are contradictory. Unless you're saying that God is saving everyone and so he answers people in different and conflicting ways because it doesn't matter to him whether people understand who he is or what his doctrine is since everyone is being saved anyway. Again, it doesn't matter whether or not you NEED prayer to answer this. The fact of the matter is that people DO pray about it and get conflicting results - indicating that prayer is an unreliable way to learn truth. Also, I'll point out that many Christians understand the Bible differently - hence the existence of thousands of different sects. One point of disagreement is what the Bible says about homosexuality. So how do we determine whether one sect correctly understands the true meaning of the bible's stance on homosexuality or another sect understands it correctly? I'm not sure, but it does seem that prayer at least is not a reliable way to finding out. Oh yes, don't read the whole thing, haha, I just wanted to give you a taste of other peoples' testimonies and how many of them rely on prayer and a feeling/experience which they've interpreted to be an answer from God about finding truth in a particular religion.  This one is more Mormon related, but it can be applied more broadly as it includes the testimonies of people of many different faiths.     Try to meet me half way in looking into this stuff. Plus if you end up believing you get to sing cool hymnals!!   What would you like me to look into? It's difficult knowing where to go when just given a website (gty.org), is there a specific sermon or article or something on there you want me to check out?"
mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"Something I've been studying a lot lately. If anyone has input it would be helpful. Don't worry, my wife doesn't think she agrees with all of it. But I've gone through some things that I had trouble dealing with and thought that the Bible resolves it pretty well. Thanks."
mormon,3dsc60,lohonomo,4,Sun Jul 19 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"We see that miraculous healings do not occur in this age   I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement you made in your article.  From Moroni 7:29, ""have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.""  Everything else seems about right, at cursory glance."
mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. I am not trying to downplay Gods power in any way. I just see the miracle age like in the NT over and with the scriptures we have enough evidence of God's plan without the need to prove anything through miraculous healing. God's saving grace is a miracle in itself, so miracles happen all of the time. Providence is constantly going on in our lives and that too is a miracle. I have just never seen any evidance of someones hollow eye coming back to life, or someone paralyzed and begin to walk, like in the NT. Smaller quite miracles happen, but the miracles that affirmed the early church needed to validate itself have passed. This is just what I see the scriptures teach, and that we should focus prayer on the miracle of salvation and repentance.   I am not trying to be argumentative. My wife says I seem that way some time to others, I just want to share with others and praise God together."
mormon,3dsc60,muucavwon,3,Sun Jul 19 02:31:12 2015 UTC,you don't come across as argumentative.  We just have different beliefs on the current existence of miracles and healings.
mormon,3dsc60,HighPriestofShiloh,3,Sun Jul 19 03:02:22 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Thank you. I appreciate that. God bless.
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,3,Sun Jul 19 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"When was the last time God healed an amputee? It's odd that God only performs miracles of healings these days when the condition is something that can be misdiagnosed, healed by the body's own immune system, or healed by medical treatment. Something like a missing limb could ONLY be healed by supernatural intervention. And God refuses to heal these kinds of conditions."
mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,8,Mon Jul 20 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"But in this period of the Church, we know that miracle of healing faded as the apostolic period ended. We can pray for the health and comfort of people, but miraculous healing do not happen as they did during the time of Jesus and the apostles.    You say this same thing, here, in the above quote.  I believe, and the Mormon church teaches, and practice shows, that through the administration of the Holy Ghost, healing and miracles still occur."

mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,-3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, but really the point in the article is that God wants salvations and obedient, repentant believers above all. Scripture used as the example. The article has a good study that helped. Thanks."
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,6,Sun Jul 19 04:28:54 2015 UTC,no. that analysis would assume that 1) God wants to heal everyone with cancer/heart disease/accident trauma and is simply waiting for people to ask for that healing and 2) everyone in Utah has the faith to either heal or be healed
mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:18:34 2015 UTC,If his mind is already made up about whether or not he's gonna heal us and praying doesn't change that then what's the point in asking at all?
mormon,3dsc60,mostlypertinant,8,Sun Jul 19 14:35:57 2015 UTC,Praying doesn't change his mind.  Just meets criteria for his will to be made manifest
mormon,3dsc60,bhroberts,7,Sun Jul 19 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"That should show up in a comparison of SLC (or any other mormon majority ares) with San Francisco (or any other mormon minority area).

mormon,3dsc60,mostlypertinant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:53:17 2015 UTC,So there are blessings that God has established he will give if prayed for that are not prayed for thus not given.

mormon,3dsc60,cenosillicaphobiac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"I hope /u/bhroberts will respond to this. This is my understanding of what he's saying as well but given God's omniscience it doesn't seem to make sense.   I'd also be curious to know if the conditions are along a sliding scale - sometimes he requires 1 person to pray, other times it's 1 person praying AND fasting. Other times it's a family fast, other times a ward fast, etc. Does he set different levels of requirements before he'll heal people? And if so, why?"
mormon,3dsc60,cenosillicaphobiac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reminder. I answered the above question.    I think thats a really fascinating question about the conditions being on a sliding scale.   Jesus seemed to indicate to his apostles that prayer AND fasting used a sliding scale when it comes to healing people in Matthew 17:21.  And, there is a popular story of Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith praying to be healed that seems to indicate that prayer works on a sort of, sliding scale, if you will.  Personally, my experiences agree with both accounts."
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"This one has never made sense to me as a father.   For example, suppose I'm at home and one of my children was experiencing a migraine headache and I knew that some Tylenol would solve the problem. My child begs me for the Tylenol but I refuse to give it to her, secretly deciding that I'll only give it to my child if 3 other people ask me to give her the Tylenol and knowing that only she and her sister are currently at home. What kind of a father would that make me? Even if for some reason I had a reason to require my child to ask for it, why would I only give it to her if a certain number of additional people asked (which number I set myself by the way)?  But I, like you, feel like this is what is actually taught at church. There's a sense that a ward fast or family fast is more powerful than a single person fasting or praying. But if that's really the case, doesn't that just really make God a horribly immoral being?"
mormon,3dsc60,PhallicMin,8,Tue Jul 21 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"You got it mostly right, I believe. I think the part you got wrong is that he knew ""nobody would in fact pray for it.""  He knew people would pray for it.  Scriptural references:   Unjust Judge, Luke 18:1-8 Importune Neighbor, Luke 11:5-10"
mormon,3dsc60,cenosillicaphobiac,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I think /u/muucavwon was envisioning something like the following scenario:  A child is diagnosed with leukemia. Of course, God knew this would happen and also knew that a total of 2 people would pray that the child would get better - the child's mother and father. With this knowledge, God decided that he would not answer the prayers and heal the child unless a total of three people prayed that the child would be healed. Therefore, God set conditions which he knew would not be met and as a result he withheld his healing power and the child dies.   Is that an accurate description of how you understand how God heals/doesn't heal people as a result of prayer?"
mormon,3dsc60,cenosillicaphobiac,5,Tue Jul 21 19:10:20 2015 UTC,I think it is less a question of quantity and more one of quality

If you don't take the time to allow study in it, it doesn't matter what I say, you have to seek and let God guide. You sound like me though when I was a teenager, so I know where you are coming from. If you really desire some help studying and understanding you can go to gty.org and get answers to your questions. There is no human way of convincing anyone about God.

mormon,3dsc60,cenosillicaphobiac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:10 2015 UTC,The evidence is all around.   What exactly?   But the Bible is the single greatest piece of it.   In what way? The bible is a book that makes claims. Many ancient religious and modern books make claims. Why is this evidence that the claims are true?   There is no human way of convincing anyone about God.   What does this mean? That there is insufficient non-supernatural evidence to conclude that there is a god?  I look forward to your responses about my links.

mormon,3drqgk,OneMoreLuckyGuy,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:27 2015 UTC,Posted this in the exmo sub but thought it might incite some good conversation over here as well. Perhaps some believers could comment?
mormon,3drqgk,Eazu,6,Sat Jul 18 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I for one agree with the principles Ordain Women has espoused, in that women should take a greater role in administration and ministration.  Administration in the Church seems to have been intended to be local (at stake level) and primarily an Aaronic priesthood role. I don't believe there is a reason a woman couldn't do the same administering that a man can do without invoking antiquated, false stereotypes and gender roles. (The current corporate hierarchy is not that, but perhaps we will return to that).  Ministering in the Church, as I read from Church history, was intended to be for both sexes. Getting to the implementation of such, through the Relief Society, anointed quorum, and such shows strongly that God wanted women to exercise the ministration of blessings.  Recent talks have focused on the fact that ""power"" in the priesthood is a function of the gift of the Holy Ghost, not a virtue stemming from ordination. This echoes of charismatic gifts of the Spirit, which are often missing in our white-washed sepulchres sacrament meetings.  So yeah, I hope to see women in the Church making and being subject to some profound positive changes to the organization."

He asked a few different times. The answer was always NO. He asked him to not ask about masturbation. He said it won't come up in the first interview, but it would come up in later interviews. So again, he said he wouldn't ask for the first, but upon my dh's request that it never be discussed directly, he said NO.  I then had a talk with our Bishop asking the same request, for one of us to be present and for masturbation to not be discussed.  I wanted to be clear that we (my DH and I) were both on the same page and that it was not just a request from one parent. The Bishop again said NO, and for some reason (because my DH and I agreed) preceded to remind me that my DH had the priesthood and was therefore the head of the family.  I was so angry I almost couldn't speak.  Wasn't the deal breaker yet, but wasn't long after."
mormon,3dqj2m,president_furiosa,13,Sat Jul 18 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure about the religion needs to include everything that bishops will be allowed to do/ask in private. This page is in the secret handbook which reinforces their public pampley, For the Strength of Youth. Zero tolerance for all things of a sexual nature!  This was a big deal for me. I didn't want my children to be placed in awkward positions in the bishop's office. This practice reinforces their belief that there are no boundaries between public and private information. When I was a believer, my parents warned me a little beforehand, but I simply assumed they were not as strong of believer as I was. I assumed it was the church that had all the right answers, not them. Now, I do not share that view. Most children would not think of questioning their basic premise in having the right to ask the question. If they are going to force the issue, and if there are certain requirements for participation, including baptisms for the dead and aaronic priesthood offices, I would much prefer that parents just said, no, and if the specific rituals were denied because of it, it goes to show their non-inclusive and arbitrary requirements.

At least now I can say ""No"" to pretty much all the questions except for #6, #7, #9, and #5, depending on who I would get for bishop roulette. Some consider pornography a violation of the law of chastity, while some consider adultery to be the only way to violate it.  Edit: Forgot about question #6."

I edited the original post to show questions that will be put to the youth of the church. See the extract from Handbook 1 that I posted.   Some consider pornography a violation of the law of chastity,   The changes in the wording of the temple ordinances regarding either ""no sexual intercourse"" vs. ""no sexual relations"" has led some to believe that the rules have been changed on them. It can become a legalistic battle akin to Bill Clinton's definition vs. Jimmy Carters'. Carter felt like Jesus message in Matthew extended to lusting after a woman, too, per Matthew 5:28. One hears urban legends of Latter Day Saint swingers who feel that if they do not engage in penis-in-vagina sex with another partner, then they may answer in the affirmative to #5."
mormon,3dqj2m,US_Hiker,8,Sat Jul 18 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"This goes back to a comment I made in the past.      Bishops usually know if a kid is struggling.   So when the ""spirit dictates"", they will follow up with ""how have you been doing with your struggles"" in reference to masturbation or what ever they know of. Bishops also learn to read people.  You and I know that if you take a 12-13 year old kid, sit him down across a desk and start asking him about chastity, you will notice a change in demeanor if they are feeling any kind of guilt. That ""prodding of the spirit"" is a bishop seeing the kid is uncomfortable which leads to the inevitable ""is there something you need to share with me?"" question.        Bishops know kids masturbate or have other issues related with being an adolescent.    TSCC gives them a blank check with the ""as the spirit dictates"" directive without having to put it in writing."
mormon,3dqj2m,Eazu,10,Sat Jul 18 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"The handbook's link back to the D&C is the explicit blank check.  Mormonism's baptismal age, 8, is pre-adolescent. Parents, especially mormon parents, may have not even begun to explain the birds and bees to their children. As full disclosure, any one joining the Church of the Latter Day Saints' needs to know they will be held to monk-like celibacy requirements. This recorded interview highlights the issue. Some bishops may give children a pass to be baptized without asking every question; others, will not. I would prefer that the age of baptism be raised to 18, then there can be little doubt the person knew exactly what it was that they were signing up for."

The rapidity of mormon courtships are often linked to the desire to lose one's virginity. If the couple soon finds out they're not sexually compatible, then too bad for them. If frigidity and unrealistic marital expectations result, then too bad for them, too. The clergy are likely to tell them to be less carnal and reread Spencer W. Kimball's advice on continence. That's all there is to it! This binary ""all or nothing"" is juvenile and a throwback to an earlier age. Most people want their human experience to include sexual satisfaction. Good luck finding it within the constraints and awkward interviews at all stages in life with the mormon clergy."
mormon,3dqj2m,dante2810,7,Sat Jul 18 20:40:17 2015 UTC,I'll point out the change in demeanor is not correlated with guilt.
mormon,3dqj2m,Caribou58,3,Sat Jul 18 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"So you are saying a kid feeling guilt will not change their demeanor, consciously or sub-consciously when asked by an authority figure they've been programed to believe is god's representative?"

mormon,3dqj2m,Eazu,4,Sat Jul 18 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"That I would agree with, but I was referring the question ""are you living the law of chastity"". 99.9% of kids in that situation would say yes without missing a beat because it was the truth.   But it was implied to us at that age that masturbation fell under the chastity rule (it doesn't in the real world) so thus you get the reaction. This is the lead in to the next level of questioning.   I remember one bishop segueing with ""are you struggling with something?"" based on my reaction.      So not a direct question about masturbation but the same results, confession. From that point on, the bishop can then ask about that as a legitimate question (in their minds) in future interviews because they are now aware of a pre-existing struggle."

This is not by way of instruction, just some personal interpretations for the purpose of maintaining a recommend in the face of losing your faith.    1.  Do you have faith in and a testimony of God the Eternal Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost?   YES!  (Faith is a personal and extremely subjective term.  Likewise 'testimony' is not necessarily an acceptance.  A witness can give 'testimony' as to what they believe and it can be either good or bad.  Thus, I submit you can have a testimony that God does not exist, but still answer this question in the affirmative.  They question does NOT as you to give your testimony, it just asks if you have one.)    2.  Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Christ and of His role as Savior and Redeemer?   YES!  (Again, the question just asks if you HAVE a testimony, not what that testimony is.)     3.  Do you have a testimony of the restoration of the gospel in these the latter days?   Same answer.  YES!   (I have a testimony that it is a total and complete fraud, but you just asked if I had one, not what it was).    4.  Do you sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Prophet, Seer, and Revelator and as the only person on the earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys? Do you sustain members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators? Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local authorities of the Church?   YES!  (These are just titles.  I don't care if they want to call them selves Grand-Pooh-Bahs, or total jack-asses.  YES, I sustain them to have the titles that they think they want.)    5.  Do you live the law of chastity?   YES!  (A little tougher to answer if you're fucking around, but still, the so-called 'law of chastity' is a moving goal post.  You certainly are living it as well as Joseph Smith.)    6.  Is there anything in your conduct relating to members of your family that is not in harmony with the teachings of the Church?   NO!  And even if there was, do you think I'm going to confess it to you?    7.  Do you support, affiliate with, or agree with any group or individual whose teachings or practices are contrary to or oppose those accepted by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?   NO!  (Since the church doesn't know from year to year what you oppose or support, how the hell could I be expected to know.  And again, even if I did, I'm not confessing to you.)    8.  Do you strive to keep the covenants you have made, to attend your sacrament and other meetings, and to keep your life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?   Hell Yes!  (I strive, daily to be a better person.  I fail miserably most of the time, but I still strive.)    9.  Are you honest in your dealings with your fellowmen?   YES!  (I am certainly as honest as the church is!)    10.  Are you a full-tithe payer?    YES!  (Read section 119 if you have any doubts).    11.  Do your keep the Word of Wisdom?   YES!  (As written it is just a guideline and I remember it often, unless I get so damn drunk that I pass out.)   12.  Do you have financial or other obligations to a former spouse or children? If yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?   YES!  (And if you're behind in your child support try to catch up).      If you have previously received your temple endowment: Do you keep the covenants that you made in the temple?  YES!  (Unless you have sold your tokens for money).  Do you wear the garment both night and day as instructed in the endowment and in accordance with the covenant you made in the temple?  YES!  (First you didn't make any covenant to wear your garments in the Temple, and second, you wear them some days and some nights, therefore you wear them days and nights). Have there been any sins or misdeeds in your life that should have been resolved with priesthood authorities but have not been?  NO!  (And again, do you seriously think I'm going to tell you if there is?)     Do you consider yourself worthy to enter the Lord's house and participate in temple ordinances?    YES.

Typically, the men called are the main provider for the family (obviously not always the case) and that man is being asked to leave their career and serve in the Church forever.   Many of the women leadership are not leaving careers with which they solely provide for their family, and most server under 10 years. From that perspective, it at least makes sense how it came to be the way it is. I think that it would be great to see women serve for longer periods of time, although the faster turnover allows for more individuals to have time serving in those positions.   Again, if you want to discuss gender inequalities, then don't go about it in ways that would be misleading to uninformed people."

Write a letter to the stake president explaining why you aren't going to take the calling if you don't feel like you could express yourself in person.  Refuse to meet.    Better way: Call your stake president tonight.  Tell him that you felt pressured into accepting this and that you have your own reasons for saying no.  Explain them if you're comfortable in doing so.  Tell him that you will not be set apart on Sunday.  Walk out if they try.
mormon,3dn0aw,curious_mormon,5,Fri Jul 17 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Between the two I'd probably opt for the ""Easy Way"". Part of the problem is that I voiced this all to my wife who thinks that I went into the meeting knowing I wouldn't want whatever they were going to give me, and that I'm not giving it a chance. She also called me out for not speaking up during the meeting and saying no there. But like I said it was a very awkward, high-pressure scenario that kind of blindsided me. Just trying to keep things smooth on the home front as well as not accept a calling I'm not interested in."

You do not need to defend why you don't wish to do this volunteer work.  You simply have decided to decline it.  That's it.  ""President, I've reconsidered the call to the elders quorum presidency and I don't feel right about accepting it.""  Don't elaborate, unless, of course, you actually want to have a discussion."

mormon,3dn0aw,Chino_Blanco,5,Sat Jul 18 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of us have a hard time saying ""no""... it gets easier with practice, mainly because we learn from experience the many benefits that come from letting people know that we value ourselves and our time enough to spend it doing what we choose to do.    It's no knock on our humanity to recognize some of our primate instincts.  Respecting ourselves by insisting our views be taken into account leads others to adopt a similar attitude of respect.    Anyways...I love my wife but she's got way more skills at navigating/exploiting group dynamics and it sometimes puts me at a disadvantage.  It helps to remember that she loves me, too, and there's nothing but upside if I can figure out how to clearly express my position on an issue, especially when done in a way that demonstrates thoughtful resolve.    Our partners in life, if they're really our partners, will gain respect for us when we step up.

It may be that this calling will give you opportunities to serve others.  You may be able to help others in the quorum with their faith in those basic fundamental principles of the gospel.

mormon,3dmj46,mostlypertinant,6,Fri Jul 17 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"My skepticism with regards to LDS postmodernism is mostly down to how blithely unaware it seems to be of how we postmoderns got here... the Restoration is ""grand narrative"" ... it's one of the wilder expressions of the teleological impulse run amok in recent history... and the moment a thinker attempts to bracket that Mormon telos, her thought would no longer qualify as LDS in any meaningful way."
mormon,3dmj46,Chino_Blanco,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"TLDR from the conclusion:   Postmodern appeals among “faithful,” or orthodox, LDS scholars have taken two forms. Beginning in 1981, antipositivists such as Louis Midgley and David Bohn deployed antifoundationalist critiques of Enlightenment claims to objectivity as an instrument to undercut the new Mormon history’s efforts to produce scholarship that was neutral vis-à-vis polemics about LDS claims to revelation. The antipositivists argued that, because knowledge is never neutral, LDS historians should abandon efforts “to understand as scholars of any faith or no faith would seek to understand” and should instead embrace the role of defending the faith from naturalistic or secularist attacks. The second kind of postmodern appeal among faithful scholars has been a diffuse perspectivism, expressed in scholars’ commitment to working from a distinctively LDS “perspective” or “point of view.”   How successful postmodern appeals will be at securing academic legitimacy for faithful Mormon scholarship is less certain. The uncertainty is due partly to a lack of clarity within religious studies regarding just how seriously scholars should “take seriously” extraordinary claims by religious insiders. The uncertainty is also due to LDS scholars’ own unsettled attitudes toward postmodernism. No doubt many faithful scholars find it gratifying to be able to cite canonical postmodern authorities against the Enlightenment rationalism that would dismiss LDS faith as self-evidently absurd. At the same time, most faithful scholars do not appear to share the left-leaning politics that postmodern scholarship usually promotes in practice. Entirely apart from questions of their philosophical consistency, postmodern appeals on behalf of cultural conservatism or religious absolutism are an odd duck, politically speaking.  I suspect that faithful scholars, like other religious conservatives, will find that postmodern appeals work best at assuring intellectually inclined insiders of the credibility of the faith and at discomfiting Enlightenment liberals within the Mormon community. If even George Marsden balks at admitting faithful scholarship on the Book of Mormon into the mainstream of academic conversation, it would appear that the prevailing politics of knowledge militates against non-Mormon academicians being persuaded to put orthodox accounts of the Restoration on a par with secular accounts."

Even if the Book of Mormon is somehow from God, I don't think the Nephi story is a real historical event.  It seems like a parable or myth to me, designed to teach a lesson.  The lesson it teaches is that sometimes in life we will be asked to do things we don't understand or don't agree with.  If the Spirit or God tells us to do them, we do them regardless of our personal feelings.   In that case, we could use the Nephi story as a lesson, without using it as a precedent for the argument that God actually commands people to cut the head off of an unconscious person.  If Nephi was real and was actually commanded to do what he did, then it may be moral relativism, but it may not.   What is God's moral code?  Maybe God has a set moral standard that he always follows no matter what, and maybe killing Laban fits into that standard.    Just because it looks like relativism to puny humans doesn't mean it is moral relativism to the almighty God, does it?    To God (if he exists and is like the Mormon God), killing a human is just ending their role in his simulation.  It's no different than my daughter destroying something in minecraft."

If this life really is just a blip in an eternal existence, killing Laban becomes a lot more palatable and a lot less final in the eternal scheme of things. However, that is also precisely the problem with it.  It makes the idea of death and killing much less final and thus, much easier to rationalize."

mormon,3ddzd7,doing_my_best,4,Wed Jul 15 16:16:59 2015 UTC,You were accidentally correct. There are no accounts of Joseph using anything other than the seer stone and a hat for what is currently in the Book of Mormon. Any accounts are for the first 116 pages which were lost. He didn't translate from the plates.
mormon,3ddzd7,The_Last_Y,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:35:15 2015 UTC,Then what about all of the other accounts made by people in and out of the church saying he translated in different ways? 100 years later did we just decided that was the story they were going to make up? Seem unlikely to me.
mormon,3ddzd7,jeranim8,4,Wed Jul 15 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"What ways are you talking about? The use of the seer stones is consistent in most accounts. Which stones he uses varies, but after the loss of the 116 pages there aren't accounts that have anything other than using the one seer stone. There were plenty of stories that were made up we can only use the best information available to determine the truth. I myself didn't know the true method of translation until the church admitted it a couple years ago.   ""Joseph Smith and his scribes wrote of two instruments used in translating the Book of Mormon. According to witnesses of the translation, when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English. One instrument, called in the Book of Mormon the “interpreters,” is better known to Latter-day Saints today as the “Urim and Thummim.”...The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates, was a small oval stone, or “seer stone.” As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure. As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.""  ""Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."""
mormon,3ddzd7,Gnolaum,4,Wed Jul 15 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"I don't believe anymore but one NOM'ish view I had was that Nephi killed Laban (for whatever reason) and then later, while writing on the plates, decided to pad his story by including the ""spirit constraining him"" business. Also, that the moral of the Book of Nephi was more of a tragic tale of how a family broke apart and Nephi was just as much to blame as Laman and Lemuel. A ""how not to guide"" so to speak."
mormon,3ddzd7,soupslurper,2,Wed Jul 15 21:25:53 2015 UTC,Depends on what you mean by 'justify'.  If by 'justify' you mean set up a coherent system where I would do the same today?  No.  Never.  Not that I don't trust god; but I don't trust my own sanity that much.  I think that hallucinations would be a more likely explanation for me.  AFAIK I have no mental/sanity issues.  If by 'justify' you mean in the context of Nephi and the story?  Why not take the stronger example of Noah?  Personally I don't treat either of these stories as a literal history; so I think that in depth analysis isn't useful.

mormon,3ddzd7,cbfw86,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"There's certainly a suggestion in Mormon theology that the god of the Ten Commandments would not have commanded Nephi to kill Laban.    Commandment #1: ""Thou shalt not kill."" Commandment #2: Get the brass plates. 1 Nephi 3:7: ""I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.""   But that aside, this is the point--which commandments are reflective of eternal laws of justice to which even Elohim is bound, and which commandments are Elohim's arbitrary innovations for manipulating events or testing obedience? For example, in the Mormon view, is torture actually morally neutral according to the laws of the universe? Would it be just for Elohim to cause gratuitous suffering?"
mormon,3ddzd7,mormbn,0,Thu Jul 16 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"What makes you think that the Mormon interpreatation of God is bound to the same law to not kill?

Commandment #2: Do your best to alleviate suffering and improve people quality of life God therefore ends up in an endless loop where he uses his power to sustain life indefinitely.   OP's - and your - error is in assuming that the Mormon God is required to follow our own notions of humanity. No where is he required to do that.   is torture actually morally neutral according to the laws of the universe?   I'm not aware of any teaching on torture. The LDS Church has retreated quite rapidly from the 60s and 70s stance of having a view on everything. I'm unaware of what it says on torture and I don't think there are all that many moral laws of the universe.   gratuitous suffering   Gratuitous from your perspective.  The general theme I'm sensing is that you like to humanise god and believe that he can be held to account to your morals. That's fine, but I find it absurd to spend your time putting on trial a being who you adamantly claim is a figment of your imagination. If you're going to make stuff up why not make up positive stuff, instead of seeking to learn from abstractions pulled from negative creations? What a strange thing to do."

On the contrary, I am making no assumption, hence the question:    which commandments are reflective of eternal laws of justice to which even Elohim is bound, and which commandments are Elohim's arbitrary innovations for manipulating events or testing obedience?    Or, as an example:    is torture actually morally neutral according to the laws of the universe?   I'm not aware of any teaching on torture.    Does Mormon doctrine provide enough guidance to take a position on the morality of gratuitous torture?   Gratuitous from your perspective.   I didn't stipulate that. I merely asked ""Would it be just for Elohim to cause gratuitous suffering?"" Maybe Mormonism has the tools to answer that sort of question, maybe it doesn't."

mormon,3ddzd7,scatterstars,5,Wed Jul 15 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"I would disagree.  Example  Situational ethics would describe a situation in which it is ok to kill someone.  If someone is trying to kill you, you can kill them in self-defense.   If someone is passed out drunk it is not ok to kill them....that would be situational ethics.  If someone is passed out drunk it is not ok to kill them unless god tells you to do it.....that would be moral relativism."
mormon,3ddzd7,ApostateFarmer,0,Wed Jul 15 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Moral Relativism (or Ethical Relativism) is the position that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective and/or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances. It does not deny outright the truth-value or justification of moral statements (as some forms of Moral Anti-Realism do), but affirms relative forms of them. It may be described by the common aphorism: “When in Rome, do as the Romans do”..

You see your line of thinking is directly answered by God in Doctrine & Covenants 132:34-36.  But, really the entire section would probably be interesting to you, as it begins from a question that Joseph Smith had regarding plural marriage of the same nature that you have about Nephi killing Laban.

Any blame then shifts to god, but then it becomes a guessing game to determine why God chose that course of action. The Book of Mormon gives a treatment of Nephi's thoughts, but it doesn't justify God's commandment.  From Nephi's perspective, the moral decision was whether or not to follow God. I don't see this as being strictly ""relativist."" As a NOM, it is unsettling because it is extremely difficult to know when a person is truly carrying out God's will, or they just say that they are.  For believers, the judgment of morality of an action almost becomes irrelevant because moral decision making has been outsourced to a priesthood leader or to deity."

Is, are view of the Hebrews, the late war and napoleon, and the book of Mormon, so similar stylistically simply because they all copy the style of the KJV Bible?  I mean, the Book of Mormon is written in King's Old English.  It is as KJV as it comes.  You know, Dallin H. Oaks gave a conference talk and referenced numerous other talks and ascriptures regarding the language of prayer.  Well, in the LDS church, the language or prayer is pronouns from KJV English.  So, did God speak to Joseph in KJV because it was popular at the time?  Is the reverence we have for KJV pronouns cultural?  Or spiritual? or both?  Interesting area of discussion."

The books undoubtedly have some similar connections due to the KJV Bible. There are similarities that tie the BoM to TLW and FBN, but remove it from VotH.

I found it and discovered that a) he said literally nothing about the event at the time and b) he wasn't even in Nauvoo at the time of the meetings.   This was on par with everything historians have discovered about it in the last couple of decades. Namely, that for such a mind blowing, game changing event, literally no one wrote about it at the time. No newspaper articles, no journal entries, nothing. The first known account of BY's supposed transfiguration wasn't written down until about a decade after the fact and, like many cultural myths, became more and more grandiose over time as people tried to ""one up"" each other as to who had the more amazing spiritual experience.   Edit: Interestingly enough, if you search ""Brigham Young transfiguration nauvoo"" on lds.org, the most recent reference to it is in an article clear back in the August 1996 Ensign. For such an amazing miracle, you would think the church would be shouting it from the rooftops a little more often than that (unless of course it has since been debunked by the historical record)."

mormon,3ddb91,mormbn,8,Wed Jul 15 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Kerry Muhlestein holds a Ph.D. in Egyptology from UCLA and is currently a BYU professor (in the Department of Religious Education). On the strength of his credentials, he made a series of apologetic videos a couple of years ago in defense of the Book of Abraham translation where he claimed that the cutting edge of egyptological research was showing that Joseph Smith had actually ""nailed it.""   It's not surprising that you haven't heard of him--he had really bad timing, because shortly after he tossed the weight of his credentials behind some pretty embarrassing apologetics, the church released the Book of Abraham essay that both acknowledged that the translation didn't match and lended institutional legitimacy to the ""catalyst"" hypothesis.  Hales and Muhlestein both try to pass off apologetics as ""scholarship,"" but are about as convincing as a cargo cult in that regard. Bushman, on the other hand, successfully managed to thread that needle with Rough Stone Rolling (albeit in a way that I believe is deceptive to believing Mormons)."
mormon,3ddb91,LarryBirds33rdFan,6,Wed Jul 15 18:21:23 2015 UTC,Muhlestein also pissed off all of Egypt lately.

As for the rest, do you ever wonder why broken bones and lost limbs never get repaired by priesthood power?  I gave blessings on my mission to the mentally ill, the terminally ill, with similar results to yours.  Honestly, it may be a comfort to the victims in some cases, but mostly it is preying on people who are at their most vulnerable, and the motivation is sadly too often our own selfish desire to convince ourselves that we hold true beliefs and power."
mormon,3dbyvg,Chino_Blanco,14,Wed Jul 15 04:21:36 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the Why won't God heal amputees? website that you've probably seen before.
mormon,3dbyvg,CultZero,9,Wed Jul 15 06:11:56 2015 UTC,Hadn't seen it but just finished reading a bit and it makes a lot more sense than wasting one's hopes on a faith-affirming coincidence.
mormon,3dbyvg,Chino_Blanco,8,Wed Jul 15 10:22:13 2015 UTC,"On my mission, we turned a corner in our car to see a lot of folk running to the median island in a road. We got out to see what had happened and found that a minivan had hit a 14 year old girl and plowed right over her.    They thought we were doctors at first so gave us a wide berth (us being the only whites around). I saw she was going into shock, but had massive head trauma (blood coming in a thick form from her ear.) Her arm was snapped clean and bent the wrong way. Any movement would have been stupid and very painful to her before the ambulance came. I got someone to get her a blanket, and then had them clear an area around her.    I set about clearing the road and directing traffic before anyone else got hit by rubberneckers.    My companion said we should bless her. I said no. Odd that, as a junior comp at the time. He did it without me knowing.    A week or so later we found out she died on route to hospital. He had a long interview with the mission pres and was visibly shaken as to why she didn't live when ""he felt strongly from the spirit"" that she would live.    He even tried insinuating that it was my fault for a bit.    It was wishful thinking. She was in no position to request or approve of such a blessing, and if she was lucid enough to hear him, probably thought it was the last rites.    Members project their desires onto ordinances and are surprised when it doesn't work?"

Preform blessing > blessing fails > not enough faith > church is true. Within the Mormon world view you have to assume that you don't really have any power if these are the conclusions drawn from blessings. So why does God bother giving people a power if, ultimately, he was going to decide if it would work?"
mormon,3dbyvg,michaelsfarrens,-5,Wed Jul 15 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"When we pray we are letting the Spirit intercede and commune with God. Our part is to be lining up our prayers with Gods will. When a prayer is answered we give God praise. Though I don't see health concerns in the bible a topic of much prayer.  Been looking and can't find any. Our examples are of prayers to be obedient, faithful, repentant, and to ask for the salvation. Many prayers like Daniels opens with praise. A lot of it. To Gods glory. My other post down there has a link to a series on prayer. Really good."

mormon,3dbyvg,michaelsfarrens,-9,Wed Jul 15 07:05:21 2015 UTC,Did see in James about praying for the sick but the emphasis went back to repentance. Blessings aren't emphasized in health often in the bible. The emphasis is like I stated earlier. Sin and repentance. Outside of Acts the church moved away from laying on of hands to confirm people. Timothy and Titus give us better examples of how the church moved out of that Acts transition from the old and new covenant.

mormon,3dbyvg,michaelsfarrens,0,Wed Jul 15 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I showed here and in other posts the biblical view on the subjects. The resources should be helpful that I linked to if you are seeking and use the time. Here is what I've gathered that might help as well. I had a lot of similar questions while studying the biblical view on doctrines. Hope it helps.    So these are some more of my favorite versus. John 1:1-14 along with other trinity related versus that deal with our Triune God. That is God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as one. Along with the last post, these also contributed to my conversion. Soon I'll start posting what I am going through in Acts, but for now I want to hit some high point, the areas that I have leaned on for a while.   John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. 8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 9 The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.  Jesus is the Word. The Word is God. Jesus was in the beginning, before time began, before creation. He always existed. We see God and Jesus given credit for creation as one entity. Again, the Word became flesh, Jesus, and He was with God and was God at the same time. This was from Sunday School recently. I need to study more on Christophanies.  I think that's how you spell it. Genesis 31:11Then the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, 'Jacob.' And I said, 'Here I am.' 12 And He said, 'Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks are streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you made a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your family.' "" Genesis 32:24, 27-30 24 Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day. 27 So He said to him, ""What is your name?"" He said, ""Jacob."" 28 And He said, ""Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed."" (only God names Man) 29 Then Jacob asked, saying, ""Tell me Your name, I pray."" And He said, ""Why is it that you ask about My name?"" And He blessed him there. 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: ""For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.""  Jesus here is identified as the ""Angel of God."" Angels do not rename humans; only God does that.  Acts 20:28 pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which He obtained with his own blood. Paul here displays the Triune God. God obtained with His own blood. We know he is talking about Jesus.  Romans 8:9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.  10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. The Holy Spirit here and elsewhere is the Spirit of God and Christ. And the Spirit is in you and Christ is in you at the same time, because they are the same.  2 Peter 1:1 Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ  ""The Greek construction has only one article before this phrase making the entire phrase refer to the same person. Thus Peter is identifying Jesus Christ as both Savior and God."" -John MacArthur Mark 2:5 And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ""Son, your sins are forgiven."" 6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 7 ""Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"" 8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, ""Why do you question these things in your hearts?   Jesus here has power over sin. The scribes accurately think Jesus is claiming oneness with God. As well as Jesus not rebuking them. John 14:9 Jesus said to him, ""Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.  Further you see his oneness with the Spirit as well. As the Father/Spirit dwells in Jesus. John 10:29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. 30 I and the Father are one.""  We see again the Trinity as the Triune God. God the Father, Jesus, and the Spirit in one. They are treated this way throughout all of scripture. It is the only way to view God, otherwise you do not know God and can not receive the new birth, salvation. The Gospel of John is a great place for new believers and those seeking truth to begin.  gty.org  http://michaelsbiblestudy.blogspot.com"

We have numerous theories   He didn't have faith to be healed (but he asked and felt it). I didn't have faith to heal (but I felt impressed to do so). The healing will come later possibly through some new medical treatment. Despite our faith and inspirations it wasn't god's will.   My feeling today are different: I can't reconcile a god who heals an old man's Parkinson's while 5 million+ children die of starvation every year.

mormon,3dbyvg,michaelsfarrens,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"Christ healed to show his sovereignty and power and his deity. At the time over the years there are many people claiming to be the Messiah but because he was able to heal do other miracles and show his Godhood he was able to show evidence of his deity and messiahship. Most the miracles especially dealing with healing we're done to unbelievers during the time of Jesus and the apostles to show their authenticity toward God and establish the church. And as with miracles of healing and tongues, they  were done to show the Jews, the Samaritans, and the Gentiles their authority and authenticity in the book of Acts. Even later in Acts as Paul takes over the ministry we see the miracles fade. Besides the example in James, believers desire holiness not health.   As far as the Word of Wisdom goes. I'll need more time to look. But I'd encourage you to look at the New Testament and see how the lifting of food restrictions and the WoW work together. Is there a specific WoW article you have trouble reconciling. It always used to cause me issues. Hope I can help though."

But we all now have access to God through Jesus in prayer and repentance. Hence we are all priests. Cf Hebrews and the new covenant.   God does care about our health, after Jesus fed the thousands he stopped. They were hungry and they asked for more. Jesus said no to their request for more food and told them about the bread of life. God is greatly more concerned with our salvation in comparison to our health. The Bible is ALL about Jesus and salvation. Very little with health at all.

Look at David's prayer in psalms and Daniels. It's a great example to how we should pray. Forgiveness, praise to God, to his glory, for obedience and salvation to others.

mormon,3dbyvg,michaelsfarrens,0,Wed Jul 15 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"This might answer some more of the other questions brought up as well.    I have been listening to the hymn ""Agnus Dei"". One of my favorites. ""Worthy is the lamb"" it says. I have been reading through and listening to a study on Hebrews and Daniel, it reminds me that His death on the cross and resurrection saved us and also gave us access to God through Jesus. There are no more old covenant customs necessary. The veil was torn, the temple destroyed. Jesus is now the high priest in heaven. The purpose of the Old Testament priesthood on earth was fulfilled (cf. Hebrews 7-8). Grace through Jesus now gives us access to God there is no more veil and holy of holies. It saddens me to see people adding barriers to God and taking people off the path to Christianity. Jesus was worthy and perfect. He took down the barriers. Don't put them back up. Over and over the apostles have told the church to stop adding to the gospel and to have faith in Christ ALONE. Anything else is not of God. Here are some areas we can study.   Galatians 1:6-9a I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel- 7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.  We can read Paul's epistles to see what he taught the churches.   2 Corinthians 11:13 such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.  Just like now and in recent past. False teachers disguise themselves but with an understanding of the Bible, you can unveil these men of Satan. Adding to scripture, desire of power, money and lusts usually is an easy sign to look for.  Hebrews 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 10 being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.  Hebrews 7:18 For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness 19 (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.  If you are reverting to old covenant works and customs, that may be an indication you are not setting aside weak and useless commandment.   Hebrews 7:22 This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant. 23 The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, 24 but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.  This is why the apostles founded churches with deacons, teachers and elders. The only head above an elder is Jesus. No temples were ever build, men and women of the Church are all priests in the sense we all have access to God through Jesus through nothing but His perfect blood. We are instructed to add nothing else to what was taught (New Testament Canon) Otherwise we are saying Jesus wasn't sufficient."

Is it its destruction/extinguishment/stagnation? Or flourishing and endless advancement leading to what we'd call today ""god""?  John A. Widtsoe put it this way:   ""Under the law of evolution, man’s organization will become more and more complex. That is, he will increase in his power of using intelligence until in time, he will develop so far that, in comparison with his present state, he will be a God."""
mormon,3db8nq,mostlypertinant,4,Tue Jul 14 22:46:51 2015 UTC,This was a fantastic post and commentary.  I was very impressed.
mormon,3db8nq,hinglemcdingleberry,4,Wed Jul 15 03:23:45 2015 UTC,Something to think about ...
mormon,3db8nq,Gnolaum,2,Wed Jul 15 03:24:49 2015 UTC,This was a great read and pins down many of the same thoughts that have been floating through my head.
mormon,3db8nq,Momofosure,2,Wed Jul 15 03:44:49 2015 UTC,"""The President of the Church may announce doctrines from revelation [from God] to him""  ""Asking God doesn't even make the list""  K  Excellent read though. Good points"
mormon,3db8nq,theshwedda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but he actually did address this:   The token nod is of course given to the President of the Church receiving revelation. But this is only a theoretical possibility and not a practical reality in the LDS Church; nor has it been for almost a hundred years. Note that the example given is D&C 138, the vision of Joseph F. Smith of the redemption of the dead. This is the last section in the Doctrine and Covenants, and was received in 1918.  Three more years will mark a century with no canonized scripture.  A strange state of affairs in a church that claims continuing revelation through living prophets."
mormon,3db8nq,Eazu,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"Fair argument. Has the author considered the many Church councils in it'd early history, such as those reported by Bushman in Rough Stone Rolling"
mormon,3db8nq,Eazu,2,Wed Jul 15 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think you have hit on possibly the strongest counterpoint.  On the other hand, it seems to me that the strongest example of a church council independent of the prophet was the nauvoo city council, which really wasn't a religious body.  (And even the ""temporal"" NCC and council of 50 were governed by Joseph as mayor and king, respectively.)  I think it's fair to characterize the Kirtland and Nauvoo high councils, and the presiding bishopric, as organizations that implemented the revelations received by Joseph and not as creating policy for the church themselves."
mormon,3db8nq,Nefi424,2,Thu Jul 16 01:10:21 2015 UTC,"We get so twisted up in our words here, especialy ""doctrine"", don't you think? Doctrine is eternal truth, and doctrine is policy, and doctrine underlies policy, and policy changes, and doctrine never ever changes. (Well... which is it?).  I'd add an additional counterpoint, though perhaps not the strongest, is that ""doctrine"" as defined by Elder Anderson and such is a different definition than ""doctrine"" as defined by LDS folks up until David O. McKay's times. In those days, ""Doctrine"" was the purview of the President of the Church, both reception and implementation.  These days, ""Doctrine"" is application/implementation of what is thought to be eternal truth into practice. Which would go a long way to explain why the handbook has become such a resource among the more orthopraxic."

If you keep attending, you'll notice that it starts to get very repetitive, with a significant focus on themes like ""the LDS church is the one true church with authority,"" ""you should obey the leaders of the LDS church,"" ""you should actively fight against internal doubts about the LDS church,"" etc.    Any suggestions or advice?   I would recommend against the LDS church if you don't want to put yourself in a position where a seriously flawed institution and its leaders assert authority over you in the name of a god and you are expected to submit to that asserted authority."
mormon,3d9nkt,mormbn,11,Tue Jul 14 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"But, There are some really great, wonderful things about the church too.   The good things about the church aren't unique (you can find those same things elsewhere without the baggage) and the unique things aren't good.  Don't bother."
mormon,3d9nkt,cenosillicaphobiac,9,Tue Jul 14 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"I normally wouldn't recommend this, but since you already have things about the corporate side of church that bother you... I'd look into the actual temple ordinances. You can find videos online and other information about what actually goes on into the temple. Mormons like to take the milk before meat method of teaching. I believe that prevents you from making a truly informed decision. If you can learn about the temple covenants and still are interested in joining their church then I think you can probably put the 'worldly' issues behind you.   As an exmormon, I personally would recommend not joining, but if it makes you happy do what you feel is best."
mormon,3d9nkt,The_Last_Y,3,Tue Jul 14 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"I have seen some of the videos, in a way it could be looked at as peaceful practices, and in another way as cultish like rituals. I haven't really made up my mind as far as that part goes..."
mormon,3d9nkt,The_Last_Y,4,Wed Jul 15 06:50:02 2015 UTC,"My first experience going through the temple was... traumatic. I was completely unprepared. For the first time I understood why people thought we were a cult. For me, given 1) the manner in which they completely fail to prepare people for what goes on in there, 2) the secrecy of what actually happens and 3) the covenants that they ask you to enter into with no prior knowledge of can't be described as anything other than cultish.   Which is why I brought it up. If you can honestly look past the deceptive nature of their holiest of ordinances then you'll make a fine mormon. If it makes you even the slightest bit uncomfortable you should trust your gut and just not get involved. If you aren't willing to go through the temple and receive those ordinances you'll never be a full mormon and eventually it will show."

There are several communities that do that, the LDS church is just one. They are also prone to unofficially shun you if you decided to leave the church.    Church is 3 hours long, but it's in depth and I love how they teach thoroughly on the gospel.   For the first year or so yes, then they repeat the same things over again at the same level of depth. In time, the majority of mormons also begin to say >""' oh, that was nice,' and forget about it""   the church ultimately seems like it is filled with good people only willing to do good things and follow God   Again, there are many such institutions you can find with these attributes  From what I've read it seems you enjoy the cultural aspects of Mormonism, and not so much the theology of it. There are several ""cultural mormons"" in LDS wards, so you would be able to fit in even if you don't believe the theology. That said, realize that the LDS church leans strongly towards an all-or-nothing paradigm. If you join the church you will be expected to follow all the rules of the organization, and share in their teachings, including the ones you find less than favorable.   Personally, since it mostly seems like you just want a community, I would suggest you look for a group with which you already share many of the same goals. Don't try to change who you are just to join a club.  Edit: grammar"

Right wing politics also tends to bleed in as they've just taken a beating on gay marriage in the United States. Nevermind, they have skeletons of non-traditional marriage in their closet. Being slightly out of step is bad enough; each member tends to out-righteous one another in a neverending treadmill of perfectionism. LGBT shaming will be full force in that church.

mormon,3d9nkt,soupslurper,4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:42 2015 UTC,In order to join the church you need to have a testimony... a basic belief that Jesus Christ is your Savior and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.

mormon,3d9nkt,verilycat,7,Tue Jul 14 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"While this is good advice, I'd highly recommend setting up a way to know actual revelation from God, rather than just emotion.  For example, I set up a passcode with God when my father died.  That way, if anyone claimed to be speaking for my father (They did) or from God (They did) I could ask them to verify the message.    None of those who claimed to be speaking from God knew there was even a passcode, let alone what the passcode was.  I also set up a passcode with a friend that messages had to end with, so that I couldn't fool myself into believing my own dreams/impressions were revelation without an independent verification.  This is a simple method to verify actual revelation (And is similar to the handshakes for verification of true messengers set up in D&C 129), that would be independent of  my own emotion helped tremendously in distinguishing ""True voices"" from emotional manipulation and my own emotional state.  ::Spoiler alert, I left the church::"

mormon,3d9nkt,verilycat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:53:08 2015 UTC,"I would start attending and see how it goes. You don't have to be baptized to attend. I would continue researching. Its good to know both sides of the story to help you best make your decision. I researched a lot, and while there is a lot of unfavorable things out there, I still ended up joining and I'm happy with my decision. Though there are things that I don't agree with (and never will) I'm comfortable with my membership and I'm not surprised when things come up that were not taught in the missionary discussions."
mormon,3d9nkt,Mithryn,5,Tue Jul 14 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"What makes you happy with your decision?  Did you find out things that actually counterbalance the unsavory parts of the church or did you go against your conscience and moral guide to be part of the group?  Because if there are counterbalances or reasons that one should decide to join that are significantly greater than the negatives, I'd love to hear them."
mormon,3d9nkt,verilycat,2,Tue Jul 14 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Haha I am really not ""part of the group"" as most everyone in my ward knows I'm not super TBM. Sure, I attend but it isn't like I show up and everyone is my friend. Plus my husband has an addiction/alcohol problem so many people ignore us because apparently since the waters of baptism didn't just instantly take away his problems he must be easily influenced by Satan himself. But I'm not at church for the people. I'm there because I honestly believe in the churches view on the Atonement and the emphasis placed on the Atonement each Sunday.   It isn't that I have some sort of secret information that ""counterbalances"" the negatives of the churches history and even some current practices. I guess I might be a ""cafeteria Mormon."" I have an easy time taking what I view as true and correct and not worrying about the rest. I'm sure that way isn't the right way for everyone. For instance, the idea that JS is a martyr is laughable to me. He didn't die from defending the religion... that is a very whitewashed view of church history. He was a hot mess with a lot of issues. I cringe when people call him perfect. He wasn't... never was... only Christ is. And since Christ himself isn't here leading the church in person I am positive that our church has a margin of error somewhere due to the nature of humankind."
mormon,3d9nkt,Mithryn,4,Tue Jul 14 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  Well, let me ask one more.  You say you like the emphasis placed on ""Atonement"".  I have a friend who asks me to explain the atonement each time we talk, and I really can't.  He says something along the lines of ""So we all sin, right?  And there is a punishment affixed for each sin.  Can you tell me the key-value pairing of sin to punishment?  Like if you smoke you get lung-cancer, or if you drink coffee you... what?  How does the punishment match up to the sin?""  Then he says, ""And how does it help to kill an innocent person to somehow, eliminate that pairing?  I mean if you can remove it by a god dying, then the pairing either wasn't just to begin with; or it is no longer just to eliminate the punishments just because someone else died""  And ya know, even from the full TBM perspective, or trying to imagine the answer, I have no good answer.  So can you explain to me how the ""Emphasis on Atonement"" makes any sense to you given the Punishment/Sin relationship explained in 2 Nephi (or do you just toss out Nephi's description of the atonement)?"
mormon,3d9nkt,verilycat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, I think one of the main problems with Mormonism is that everyone seems to be so damn literal. If we know that ""plain and precious truths"" have been removed from the Bible, I can't personally hold that book to be 100% literal truth. I also know that JS fucked up and lost his original interpretation of the BoM because he was acting a fool. So if the original was lost and he did a little hocus pocus to remake it... well then I can't know for certain that the BoM is 100% literal truth. I do believe they are both INSPIRED works that help us in this mortal life.   I hate the word punishment. It makes God seem cruel. I prefer consequence. Because consequence is a more natural term. If you make a choice, there is a consequence that can be good or bad. I also don't think that the consequences are always the same for everyone because hey, that is life. I don't view things like smoking and drinking coffee as sins. I think the word of wisdom is a health code for us and also a sacrifice for us. So sure, if you smoke you might get lung cancer but you might not. You might just miss out on the money that you spent on something so useless. You might miss out on some sort of opportunity, like a date or a friendship, because someone is put off by the smell. Is missing out on a date really a punishment? Or a consequence? I don't think God is up there saying ""That fucking VerilyCat caved and bought a raspberry mocha frappuccino! I'll show her!"" I think that there might be something that I miss out on because I chose to drive to starbucks and get my fix. I might be missing out on a service opportunity that would bless me or I might miss the neighbor kid coming over to play with my daughter... so many different things could be happening. I don't find that to be a punishment, just a consequence. I find there to be a difference between the two, though some might say it is nit-picking. Either way... are we learning from these consequences? Are we trying to be better... are we joining in on the ""perfecting of the Saints""? Are we choosing salvation?   Jump down to 27 and 28. Agency is such a huge emphasis. No other church I've been to has had such an emphasis on our own agency and how much of a gift that really is. We are supposed to be doing our best to make the correct choices. But we have Jesus, our mediator, to help us, because in the end we are not perfect and we might need a tutor at the end to pass the class. And he is the best. He is our brother; our gladiator. He will fight for us if we are fighting for ourselves and doing the best we can. Everyone's best is different. Heck my best on Monday was a hell of a lot different than my best is today. The guy who murders 1 person and resists the urge to do it again will have difference consequence than the guy who murdered everyone he felt the urge to kill. But what if murder #1 just doesn't give a damn? Sure, he followed the spirit and stopped killing but he doesn't really care that he killed someone... he just don't really want to get into any more trouble. Murder #2... well... he feels remorse. He knows he was wrong. He is sorry. He repents. Will their punishments or consequence be different? I think so. I imagine that murder #2 would get into heaven before murderer #1. Both men will die... which will live again? It is very clear in the scriptures that the man who repents and comes unto Christ will rise again. The end punishment for our lives is death. We all die. All sins are equal and we all die. It is the path to our death that matters. Christ died and overcame death so that the righteous could overcome death, too.   We take sacrament every week. That is also different from other churches I've attended. Every week we have the opportunity to repent for our sins, to take a hard look at our choices and the consequences and learn from them. Each week we have an opportunity to thank Christ for taking on our sins, for fighting for us, for being our mediator, for completing the plan. We think about his atonement and think about our own atonement... are we repenting? Are we learning? Changing? Growing? Or are we stuck doing the same thing over and over again, saying the same things over and over again, becoming stagnant with our personal and spiritual growth while thinking that church attendance or reading a few scriptures is ""good enough""?  To me, the emphasis on atonement is the emphasis on my personal responsibility to my salvation and the help I will receive from Christ. I had a RS teacher once say that it is not ""endure to the end"" it is ""serve to the end"" because that is what Christ did. We need to serve ourselves and serve others. We need to make choices that benefit our salvation and the salvation of others."

They could potentially spare the mods there a lot of headaches. Although, as you say, they are vague. I worry that they may be too vague. One of the problems that /r/latterdaysaints has tried to avoid is the problem that led to its creation in the first place. Namely one mod enforced his personal view of what ""faith positive"" meant.  The rules now represent a compromise that has gradually been struck over a couple of years of trying to avoid the the problems of a bunch of hyper-technical rules that people will argue and flaunt on grounds of technicality and rules that are so vague that no one can know what to expect.  I do think your proposed rules are worth running by the mods."

mormon,3d9707,curious_mormon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"It is a pretty impressive list, until you start looking into each sub. /r/BYU is not really about the church. It is a school sub. For most Mormons like me who never went there, we would have no interest in that sub. Just like many Catholics probably would not be interested in participating in /r/notredame.  As you said, some are niche. Specifically, /r/ldsmedia, /r/LDS_Youth, /r/LDSmommas, /r/LDSARP, and /r/fairlds (and arguably /r/scripturestudy). These subs are topic specific. not going to interest more than a few specif people and will not appeal to believing latter-day saints generally. That leaves 5, including /r/scripurestudy (and obviously /r/latterdaysaints).  /r/lds2 was founded by yours truly back when it looked like smacktaix might shut down the origional /r/lds. It has one moderator (me), one subscriber (me again) and zero posts or content. When everyone moved to /r/latterdaysaints, it became useless. So it is not a place for faithful to gather. /r/truetbm was set up with the same purpose as /r/lds2 and, as you can see, has not seen activity for almost 3 years.   It remains to be seen what will become of /r/lds. It is smacktaix's thing. I see it as a place where people can post things that agree with smacktaix and I doubt that very many will be interested, but we will have to see, it may fill a important part in the market.  So you have /r/scripturestudy, which is sort of niche in that it is focused on scriptures and gospel topics (no news, current events, culture, or policy discussions), but is reasonably popular with 176 subscribers, and /r/latterdaysaints.  What /r/latterdaysaints is is the largest gathering of believing mormons on reddit (and possibly on the internet). /r/mormon is a place to discuss Mormonism. /r/latterdaysaints (while trying to acomplish several functions at the same time) is more of a place for believing Mormons to congregate online."

Just because they theoretically could choose some other place or places, should not mean that should not be catered to in the place that they do choose.   Does this go for critics of the church that could theoretically choose to post in your sub? Should they be catered to?   I don't really care how you moderate your own sub specifically*, but the OPs conversation is a natural byproduct of those rules.  You're trying to create a private club in a public space.  That will push out the undesirables who will complain in other forums, even if they were pushed out accidentally or as a blanket moderation policy.  If you don't like that then go private or stop moderating like a middle-eastern theocracy.    * I am vocally opposed to restricting speech that's both factually correct and on topic simply because it contradicts a pre-determined agenda, but that doesn't apply just to /r/latterdaysaints moderation.

In the past, the church has stated that they would withdraw from the scouting program if they had to accept openly gay leaders. While the church can and will control this at the ward level, they can't control leadership at camps or within the local councils, whom they have no choice but to be involved with."

It is sort of a distraction, but the founder of the boy scouts sounds like he could have been a closeted/repressed homosexual. He had migraine headaches when he slept with his wife. They relented when he went back to sleeping on the veranda. Quote wikipedia:   Directly after he had married, Baden-Powell began to suffer persistent headaches, which were considered by his doctor to be of psychosomatic origin and treated with dream analysis. The headaches disappeared upon his moving into a makeshift bedroom set up on his balcony.    [...] Three of Baden-Powell's many biographers comment on his sexuality; the first two (in 1979 and 1986) focused on his relationship with his close friend Kenneth McLaren. Tim Jeal's later biography discusses the relationship and finds that there is no evidence that this friendship was physical. Jeal then examines Baden-Powell's views on women, his appreciation of the male form, his military relationships, and his marriage, concluding that, in his personal opinion, Baden-Powell was a repressed homosexual. Jeal's conclusion is disputed."

I agree that most LDS members are abysmal with interpreting symbolism. The entire temple ceremony is rife with it, and yet, because of the 'sacredness' of the ceremony, nothing is discussed - ever.  I came to the understanding that the sign, token, & name, were in fact a three fold repetition that was presented so perhaps the initiate would come to an understanding..?  If you think about what is presented - carefully, you may see this as well.   As far as the ""new name,"" this is designated according to the day the candidate shows up for his/her endowment. (There is a site devoted this, BTW).  Early members would pray ""in secret"" using and use the particular ""sign"" to know things in the past, (new name & sign), or present, (second Aaronic name & sign), etc..  This was given to the Seventies and the Twelve by BY, (minutes for both Quorums, December 1845 on microfilm). This is still done today in temples, when in the prayer circle, the person offering the prayer ALWAYS does so while in the second sign of the Aaronic priesthood - for things presently; also your name right at this present moment in time..  In outlying areas, (those far away communities that BY sent on 'missions'); the Stake HC would meet monthly, change into our temple robes, and offer prayer accordingly. This was discontinued during the end of Spencer W. Kimball's tenure as prophet.  So much more to add.. This should suffice for now."

mormon,3d2yky,Unmormon1,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:26 2015 UTC,Just that there could be that much packed in there.
mormon,3d2yky,cuddlesnuggler,2,Fri Jul 17 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting take on it.  Has anyone else taught the new name to be associated with the preexistence?  I've heard it called your celestial name that you'd be called after, but that's more in line with the whole 'new' part."
mormon,3d2yky,Unmormon1,2,Mon Jul 13 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"Brigham said (in the meeting minutes referenced by Emerituslds above) that the ""new name"" received in the temple had to be an ancient name (today ""Joseph"" and ""Emma"" count as ancient enough, I guess) and would be used with it's corresponding sign in the true order of prayer to inquire after past things. The name of the third token would be used in inquiring after future events. The name of the fourth would be used to request a messenger. I don't know that he necessarily associated the ""new name"" with premortality. He just said it had to be ancient.   I think the ceremony itself provides enough support for Corbin's linking of the new name with premortality, as the ritual events that produce it occur in the garden in the presence of God."
mormon,3d2yky,cuddlesnuggler,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:44 2015 UTC,ok thanks.  I thought it was mostly just our password for future stuff like our celestial Siri (white stone/U&T) and resurrecting our wives.
mormon,3d2yky,Unmormon1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"I usually take Brigham's doctrine with a big grain of salt. This is not really different, except that he was speaking in 1845, just a year after Joseph's death. I think he may have been transmitting some things he learned from Joseph (which matters when you are trying to discern the intent of the ritual, regardless of your belief about Joseph as a prophet).  As always (ahem...Adam-God...ahem), it's hard to tell where Joseph's doctrine ends and Brigham's interpolations begin.    I don't think people were ever intended to think the ""new name"" received in the endowment ritual was the same thing as the ""new name"" and white stone spoken of in the D&C, any more than they were to believe that passing through a polyester veil into a tackily decorated room was an actual entry into the celestial kingdom. I'm not even convinced the ritual name is meant to symbolize the scriptural new name. In the scriptures, the new name is associated with receiving the promise of exaltation, which only happens ritually once the initiate is through the veil."
mormon,3d2yky,cuddlesnuggler,3,Mon Jul 13 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"We read in the revelations of St. John, that the Saints are to receive a white stone, ""and in the stone a new name, which no man knoweth save him that receiveth it."" Joseph tells us that this new name is a key−word, which can only be obtained through the endowments. This is one of the keys and blessings that will be bestowed upon the Saints in these last days, for which we should be very thankful. JD 19:251 − p.252, Charles C. Rich, February 10, 1878   In the temple it always seemed pretty literal to me.  Maybe originally it was treated more symbolically since everyone got the same name.  When the masons started it they used it as clearly symbolic rather than trying to give it some divine and secret origin."
mormon,3d2yky,Unmormon1,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"1878   That's the problem with statements like this.  People like Charles Rich using Joseph as their sock puppet to repeat the understanding of the endowment that had become vogue in 1878.    When Joseph talked about the ""endowment"", it was not merely the ritual he was referring to.  You weren't really endowed until you had put the keys to work and made contact with God, who then did the actual endowing.  The ritual was always a symbol.   Edit: It may be that the new name in the ceremony was originally supposed to be an analogue for the scriptural new name.  It just doesn't make sense in the current iteration of the ritual."
mormon,3d2yky,cuddlesnuggler,2,Mon Jul 13 17:09:25 2015 UTC,So I guess the church should start calling it a pre-endowment since nobody's gotten a real one?  I think there's a lot more symbolism found in the modern versions of the ceremony than in the early ones since the signs were just acting out the murder/suicide penalties associated with revealing the secret combinations.
mormon,3d2yky,cuddlesnuggler,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"I think ""pre-endowment"" would be a much more accurate term.  Read anywhere in scripture where people are ""endowed with power"". It is always talking about actual heavenly manifestations, revelations, and explicit bestowals of power.  It is never referring to an earth-bound ritual communicating secret handshakes.  The ritual shows the form by which saving knowledge is communicated. It doesn't actually give you the knowledge that saves you.    I think removing the penalties was a terrible decision.  I don't think you can cut a covenant without them.  It certainly made the ritual more palatable, but it did so by transforming it into a different ritual. Not that it makes much difference to people who had basically no idea what they were doing in the first place."
mormon,3d2yky,emerituslds,2,Mon Jul 13 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link.  Clearly the fruit of many years of thoughtful study on Corbin's part.    I differ with him on this point:   From time to time, I have encountered the question, “Where is Jesus in the temple?”Jesus in temple It is a good question. Jesus never appears in the temple drama. But Jesus does appear in the endowment. In fact, he is present all along. But he is not on the screen. He is in the audience. Each temple patron ritually portrays the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus during the course of the endowment. This is easy to overlook because the endowment is a “stage, and one man in his time plays many parts.” More than that, one man (and one woman) plays many parts at the same time. At first, the patrons represent themselves during their first endowment session, and thereafter represent persons who have died. At the same time, the male patrons hand claspalso represent Adam and the female patrons also represent Eve. But while these multiple levels of representation are occurring simultaneously, there is another level of representation. All men and women individually represent Jesus Christ. They do so through the tokens they receive. The third and fourth token are the most obvious in this regard, and taken together represent the crucifixion of Jesus. All patrons are symbolically crucified through the third and fourth tokens, and may say with Paul, “I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.” (Gal. 6:17)   I don't think reenacting the Christ cycle is the same a ""representing"" him. We do it as emulators and apprentices, attempting to ""put on"" Christ.  Christ is still an entity external to the initiate within the context of the ritual.   This ""putting on"" of Christ is symbolized by donning the skin of the sacrificial animal, cut with the marks of the creator.  In the original ceremony the marks were cut at the veil, which happens to carry corresponding marks. In that sense, the veil, which is the way back to the Father's presence, is the template for marking the initiate who is about to become a Christ. In some ancient paintings of the Annunciation of Gabriel to Mary, Mary is busy spinning the red wool for the temple veil when she is told she will bear the Christ child. The veil is ceremoniously unveiled in the Terrestrial world, which, in Joseph Smith's cosmology, is the sphere of existence in which Christ can personally appear to someone.   If one sees the initiate as ""representing"" Christ, as Corbin seems to, rather than merely emulating Christ, he might get the impression that the ascent to God's presence is supposed to be a post-mortal journey. This idea was anathema to Joseph Smith. The ceremony's purpose to instruct us how to commune with God in this life. The tokens use Christ's suffering as an analogy for the depth of consecration required to bear God's presence.  We shouldn't get the impression that we are supposed to wait until after the resurrection before making our ascent. Brigham Young may have believed that, but he didn't really have any experience communing with God.  Sadly, it's his summary of the endowment we quote to each other before each session."
mormon,3d2yky,TotesMessenger,2,Mon Jul 13 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"""Sunday, 28th December 1845 Meeting at half past 10 o'clock this day in the attic story of the Temple...Pres. Young came into the room at 1/4 before 12. M. - He said he supposed those present were a part of those who had received their endowment, that they were those who desired to be wise and do honor to the cause they have espoused, and bring no reproach upon the character of him who has given us of the Kingdom liberally. The Keys or signs of the Priesthood are for the purpose of impressing on the mind the order of creation - In the first place the name of the man is given, a new name, Adam, signifying the first man or Eve, the first woman - Adams name was more ancient than he was - it was the name of a man long before him, who enjoyed the priesthood. The new name should be after some ancient man - Thus with your ancient name, your modern name, and the name that was last given you, you enquire concerning thing[s] past present & future -  After his fall, another name was given to Adam, and being full of integrity, and not disposed to follow the woman nor listen to her was permitted to receive the tokens of the priesthood.""  ( Heber C. Kimball Journal 28 Dec. 1845, LDS archives )  ""Sunday, December 28, 1845....president B. Young then arose and said that inasmuch as this congregation that are present are those that have received their endowments and only a small part of them, therefore I will give some general instructions.  While the bread and wine are preparing[,] the ordinances that you have received in the garden together with the performances of those things that has been presented are to represent the creation of the world, the name that was given to Adam was more ancient than he was. The Adam was given him because he was the first man but his name name pertained to the Holy Priesthood and as I before stated is more ancient than he was. There are four penal signs and four tokens and should I want to address the throne to enquire after ancient things which transpired on planets that rolled away before this planet came into existence I should use my new name which is ancient and referred to ancient things. Should I wish to enquire for present things I should use my own name which refers to present things and should I want to enquire for future things I would use the third name which refers to the first token of the Melchizedek priesthood or is the third token that is given and refers to the Son.  The second token of the Melchizedek priesthood is to be given only in one place and nowhere else[,] but these signs and token[s] that pertain to the priesthood should never be given any where only in such places as belong to the priesthood and that too by none but such as belong to the order of the priesthood.

While temples have expanded prolifically since then, and presumably temple work, the actual progress indicates that the stone is shrinking instead of growing with respect to relative population.  And that's just the raw numbers issue.  There's also the issue with unique names.  There are not nearly enough researched names to even keep people busy in the temples, so names get reused over and over to keep them occupied.  Some temple workers have said the names are used for 3 days before being passed to another temple while others have said they have a few names that are generic enough that they reuse them thousands of times without raising eyebrows."

mormon,3czjpm,Chino_Blanco,3,Mon Jul 13 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"http://bycommonconsent.com/2009/05/28/what-happens-in-the-temple-when-we-run-out-of-ancestors/     But although my mother is to the best of my knowledge the only member of her family to join the Church, I have made a surprising discovery as I have begun searching for her ancestors: after three or four generations, the vast majority of her ancestors have already been entered into New Family Church by other members who I don’t know, and their ordinances have already been done multiple times (except for sealings).   The repeats are likely from a lack of control of the lists of names, but there will be a point where they will have to start going through their lists again.  It's simply a matter of mathematics. If the average member submits 4 generations of work, then that work can be done by that member in a matter of a few visits.    Granted: Not all members have recommends, and even less do all that work, so some work does go to other ""worthy"" members.    However, multiply the ability to do the work quickly with expanding numbers of temples, and a slower rate of submission now that many sources have turned away mormons from their records, and you have a set limit that is soon reached. If each temple did just 200 ordinances a day, you'd need something like 7 million names a year to keep those temples busy, or, you'd have to start recycling names.  I have heard first hand anecdotes of temple baptism trips for youth being cancelled due to lack of names.  The human record of the deceased that is available to the church is finite."

mormon,3czjpm,TheBake,3,Mon Jul 13 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a few more. http://www.ldsfreedomforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=17598  The church has been repeating names, the evidence lies in the genealogical records. They have now got more control on it, and have reduced the amount of work that can be done by youth, as seen in that link, or they will have to start recycling names again.    So there's an obvious problem. With rationing or recycling, members don't actually need to go as often as they think. Which hits the bottom line."

mormon,3czjpm,JKimballHCM,2,Mon Jul 13 02:31:52 2015 UTC,Also: if the reason we can't wait for the Millenium and perfect genealogical information and the help of countless angels doing the ordinances is that every minute our ancestors spend waiting is a minute in prison ... It must really suck to have been born before modern record keeping circa 1400 AD. Everyone born in the 5000+ years (depending on how you view young earth creationism) before that is just SOL anyway.

Without urgency around a need to do temple work, it would be hard to impress upon people the importance of a temple recommend.  Without the importance of temple recommend, it would be extremely difficult to convince people to be full tithe payers.  Without people being full tithe payers, the church would wither and die."
mormon,3czjpm,JKimballHCM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"Because it gives the members busy work, that placates their need to do charity in such a way that binds them tighter to the church, keeps them tithe paying, and doesn't divert their time and monies to something truly useful, like helping the poor.

mormon,3czjpm,WillyPete,-3,Fri Jul 17 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"we should share with our families our love of our forebears. What is that all about?

How can you love them if you know nothing about them?  Maybe that is good enough reason to do what we can, now, to learn about them.  Also, I believe family history and temple work really does bless those that do it in addition to blessing those for whom it is done.  There is a war going on in the Spirit World, so here too for that matter.  The spirits of our ancestors are fighting on our side.

mormon,3cvx1u,sonnyperdition,3,Sat Jul 11 14:02:03 2015 UTC,"The church, when it was at its best, pushed members to craft their own spirituality, to seek individual revelation and guidance; and to care for and love all members of the community. The concept of individual revelation and spiritual seeking is encapsulated in the word agency. As an anarchist I believe that agency resonates strongly with the political concept on individual sovereignity, or as Foucault termed it, self-determination. So, for me, in spite of its current iteration as financial behemoth, authoritarian monolith and punitive spiritual executioner there still exists a moment, an iota of untrammeled freedom, of hard glowing liberty that, no matter how hard they try, the Q15 will never be able to eliminate. I just hope one day this anarchist spark grows to a raging conflagration that no GA exhortation could ever extinguish; leaving in its fiery wake 15 million prophets and prophetesses, free to walk their own path to salvation."

Heck, I'm even grateful for my mission.  I'm typing this from a hotel room in Tokyo and I've always appreciated that my mission got me started on a path that's taken me all over the world.

mormon,3cuthr,doing_my_best,15,Fri Jul 10 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"Usually when the LDS church talks about JS they only show the good things about him but a majority of the truth is painful and you've been conditioned to reject and marginalize these facts as 'anti', not true, or unimportant.  EDIT: I don't think OP is coming back to discuss anything but I wanted to add this anyway. It isn't true that you have no doubt. You and many other TBMs just act like you have no doubt and say things to make other people think that they have no doubt until you finally trick yourself into thinking that you don't have doubt. But you do have doubt. At some level there is some evidence that would convince you that JS was a fraud. You might have never pondered it, you might not be comfortable talking about it, you might not be comfortable even thinking about it. If God or Jesus or [insert hipster-esque reference to any lesser-known deity] descended the heavens and came to you in person and stated; ""JS was not a prophet. JS was a fraud. The BoM is made up."" and threw in a signed heavenly-legal-binding-statement with this quote printed on it, you would have to accept that. It just seems that no TBM can correctly use the terms; know, knowledge, doubt, understand [probably missing a few]. LDS culture normalizes these misconceptions."

Where the folk tales about him particularly compelling?  Can you think of no other explanation for how the church was formed?  Is it from your upbringing, from your devout study of the man and his church, personal revelation, what exactly caused you to come to this conclusion?  I'm genuinely interested because I can't say that I ever felt a personal connection to the man and never really believed any of the stories, despite being from a family that is still highly active, and fielded two sister missionaries in the early 80's when it was still very unpopular.  My indoctrination cred is impressive, grew up in Kaysville, in the heart of the beast as it were, church and seminary, all the Aaronic priesthood roles, and yet it never really stuck.  What was it exactly that caused you to believe?  EDIT:  I wanted to add that ""no doubt"" about something can be a very dangerous thing.  I can't honestly say that I have ""no doubt"" about nothing.

When I think of ""Joseph Smith"" I immediately think ""That is a man of God and a prophet"", not ""Wow, what a crook""  So why is there so much evidence against it?

They can be denied all kinds of things with the most common reason given by most bishops is that ""sin"" drives the spirit away. A state of near perfection is ideal in mormonism. It is ironic that a person must be considered ""worthy"" in mormonism to partake of the sacrament. That concept alone should be setting off alarms for anyone who reads Matthew 11:28 or lay claim any of the basic Christian philosophy per Ephesians 2:8-10. Double up on the irony and realize that by modern mormon standards, the founder himself would be unworthy. Let alone his creepiness and criminal behavior...

Mormon culture can be insular; the Mormon church teaches that ""the world"" (everything outside the Mormon church) is a dark, confused, dangerous place. Mormonism is held to be the one true way. Mormons are urged to shun any ""bad influence"" or ""negative environment."" The understood scope of what makes a negative environment extends to a lot of benign behavior. Mormonism encourages self-consciousness and the feeling that behavior that does not meet their standards constitutes a personal aggression--or even the manifestation of Satan's influence on their world. Mormonism teaches that Mormons are guided by the Holy Ghost (or ""the Spirit""), which gives them special directions from God and protects them from temptation and harm. Mormonism teaches that the Spirit leaves the area when speech, images, etc. that are offensive to Mormons are present. Mormonism associates feelings of discomfort or unease with the Spirit ""leaving.""   On the flip side, Mormonism is (for a high-demand, authoritarian religion) fairly integrated into broader society. A good number of Mormons are used to and comfortable with hearing other people swear. A few Mormons even swear themselves. But closer to where the central leadership is (Utah and Idaho), a lot will freak out."

In cases where ""it's obvious"", utilitarians don't even believe it! Because of diminishing marginal utility, utilitarianism says (roughly--utilitarianism can't possibly actually say anything precise) you should sell your possessions and donate most of your wealth to a hundred of the world's poorest people, because it would completely change their lives.  Second, how does utility define morality? And how is that not a nakedly mystical idea? Sure, we can just say that morality is utility, but we can also say that morality is what God says--both are just assertions.

What if playing chess in the sand is actually quite unpleasant? Do I account for these things, measure them somehow? Am I solving a linear programming problem?

No. Placing a value of 10 on ""a day at the beach"" presupposes an understanding of what experience you're getting. If one's understanding of a quintessential day at the beach includes playing a game of chess, the value of 10 would incorporate the experience of the game of chess at the beach. If ""a day at the beach"" refers to swimming and beach volleyball at the beach all day, then chess is excluded from the experience.   Playing chess at the beach would be a different experience, which is recognized by the question ""What if playing chess in the sand is actually quite unpleasant?""   And where did I get to 10 and 6--what does it mean for something to be 67% more pleasurable than another?    Here's one way: if you prefer candy bar A to candy bar B, but would be indifferent between 6 independent experiences of eating candy bar A and 10 independent experiences of eating candy bar B, then you might assign the value 10 to each independent experience of eating candy bar A and the value 6 to each independent experience of eating candy bar B."

I think adhering to strictly to any one philosophy is dangerous.   then literally everything that can lead to utility has moral content.    Meh, something like beach sitting or playing chess is so negligible as to not be worthy of my time, the utility of wasting time on senseless shit like that instead of enjoying life would make it immoral to fuck with it at all.

mormon,3ctfd6,4blockhead,9,Fri Jul 10 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"...a philosophy that is considerably sillier than what they left behind.   I think the philosophy of mormonism is encapsulated nicely in section 132. Special privileges are codified for blind obedience and members are tasked with accepting changes to the rule book on the fly, even changes deemed previously immoral. Those that accepted that scripture were the ones who abandoned all critical thought. The debunking of Book of Mormon peoples and the claims about the origin of the Book of Abraham and Smith's supposed translation into a new cosmology came later. The religion falls in a heap of ruins using 132 alone.  The difference also comes down to Benson's ""14 fundamentals."" Does privilege of priesthood office grant a person the right to weigh in on scientific principles, with no previous study or familiarity? I concede that anything is possible. I don't see evidence for progress coming from the mouth of the Latter Day Saint prophets. We could really use a solution to global warming, resource depletion, poverty, threat of human extinction, etc. Instead, the leadership focus on a hypothetical end game that predicts cataclysm and destruction. It's not an optimistic or positive outlook. Science starts with no predefined outcomes. The chips fall where they may. But whether the entire universe was predestined from the moment of its creation has been widely debated.  I wrote a short essay about alternate creation myths just now. For me, myths include the ideas which are unlikely to be definitely proved one way or another. Another name for speculation and postulates. Science says even hard problems might be solved, and if proof is submitted, then facts stand on their own merit. It doesn't matter what we think..."

I know a little bit about situational ethics, which I should have learned about when immersed in mormonism using the example of the founder, but I missed that the first time around."
mormon,3ctfd6,mormbn,7,Fri Jul 10 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, is utility a useful concept?   I don't accept utilitarianism as axiomatic, but it is certainly a useful concept. Like most useful concepts, it has limits.   How do I compare the utility of sitting on a sunny beach with the utility of playing a game of chess?   That depends on your evaluation function. A nice feature of utilitarianism is that it would urge you to make your evaluation function explicit, which you could then compare with other evaluation functions to test your approach to decision making for internal consistency--which, in turn, could give rise to a reconsideration of your evaluation functions, to your choices, or both.   Utility fails instantly to tell me even the most basic things about moral action--even if we make guesses as to what has more utility, we can't possibly know if we were right, even after the fact.   We can certainly make judgments with varying levels of confidence. Uncertainty does has a place in critiquing some applications of utilitarianism, but it doesn't render the concept meaningless.   In cases where ""it's obvious"", utilitarians don't even believe it! Because of diminishing marginal utility, utilitarianism says (roughly--utilitarianism can't possibly actually say anything precise) you should sell your possessions and donate most of your wealth to a hundred of the world's poorest people, because it would completely change their lives.   This argument carries irony if the preferred alternative to utilitarianism is to accept Jesus as a moral authority. Hypocrisy could be put forward as an explanation for both utilitarianist and Christian failures to sell all their possessions and donate the proceeds to the poor, but presumably the Christian would not argue that this demonstrates that Jesus makes a poor moral authority.  There are, of course, convincing utilitarian arguments against dumping wealth windfalls on poverty. It may be, for example, more effective to donate the proceeds to the Gates Foundation rather than the poor. It may be even more effective to dedicate one's resources to political opposition that attacks the structural conditions of poverty. These significant objections aside, it seems unlikely that many people (even those who would profess to it) operate according to a pure utilitarianism. This, however, does not go far in support of the proposition that ""it is put to virtually zero use in the real world""--though I would agree that human praise of rationality tends to outstrip the practice of rationality.   Second, how does utility define morality? And how is that not a nakedly mystical idea? Sure, we can just say that morality is utility, but we can also say that morality is what God says--both are just assertions.    ""Morality""/""ethics""/""should""/""the good life"" are all human-created terms that reflect various human impulses and experiences, including those relating to satisfaction-seeking, empathy, reason, etc. ""Utility"" is also a human-created term that maps to many of those human impulses and experiences and can be used to model their interplay in a sometimes powerful way.  Why would ""morality"" be ascribed to a god in the first place? Because people who wish to promote the god want to say that it is good. The human understanding of goodness and morality precedes any god to which those concepts are ascribed.    God at least has the benefit of being a coherent concept   Whatever virtues the Judeo-Christian(-Mormon) god concept may have, a strong claim to coherency is not one of them."

Great, so I'm sitting here playing a game of chess. I'll use your evaluation function, just to see how it works. What observable phenomena do I measure, and what's the formula to plug the measurements into?"
mormon,3ctfd6,mormbn,3,Fri Jul 10 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"What observable phenomena do I measure   What's important to you? The mental immersion of play? The satisfaction of victory? The social interaction with your opponent? Etc.   what's the formula to plug the measurements into?   You wouldn't likely need or want to go that far for evaluating the experience of playing a game of chess. Depending on what kind of decision you're trying to make, it could be enough to investigate the elements of your evaluation function enough to make pairwise comparisons with other alternatives. For example, if you are having a hard time making a judgment about the relative importance of mental immersion, the satisfaction of victory, and the social interaction, but you are having an easier time making judgments about the relative fulfillment you find for each of these aspects in their respective games, you could reason that you are best off playing go and poker to the exclusion of chess, even though you don't strictly prefer either one to chess. So the concept of utilitarianism hasn't guaranteed you the optimal choices, but it has helped you reason through rejecting some inferior choices."

mormon,3cf38x,muucavwon,10,Tue Jul 7 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"I think the Givens style of belief is among the worst out there. They propose believing in the mormon god, albeit redefined to fit their personal taste. They each frame their personal god in the mode of their favorite authors and myths from history. They seem to have latched onto the mormon god presented in the Book of Moses as containing some deep and profound meaning. The mormon god weeps as he contemplates genocide against his creation of humanity. Despite a few tears, the god went through with the flood and all of the destruction that is inherent in that myth. What lesson are we to take away from that story? Vengeance is mine saith the lord? Do what I say, or else!   It's going to take some fancy summersaults and mental gymnastics to sort that out in a positive sense. I don't think it's possible, even for the well educated Mr. and Mrs. Givens. The much simpler explanation is that humanity is emerging from a hostile physical world. Many random events have plagued the species throughout our history. It is likely that our early ancestors have been swept away by floods in the past. Tsunamis and natural forces continue to wreak havoc on our species. Our foothold on this planet remains very tenuous: resource depletion, poverty, global warming, mass extinctions, pandemics, and the rest show our species could vanish in a relative heartbeat of geologic time. Reality demands we take the reins and embrace science and secularism. Falling back on primitive myths is extremely juvenile and lacking in my opinion.  The Givens have simply fallen back into the rut that people will probably believe in some form of deity. Why can't it be the one Joseph Smith presented? A cynic would say that their books are designed for one thing and one thing only. To stanch the bleeding of potential tithe payers that are leaving the faith entirely. Count me among the cynics.

First of all it assumes that scripture contains an accurate record of actual events - it doesn't. Scripture has never been about historicity, and indeed all of our ancient scripture was written long before the historical method was developed. Literalism is a response to to the enlightenment, and ignores the many centuries of hermeneutic tradition. Paul himself outright rejects a literal approach to the scriptures that existed in his day. So literalism is also self-refuting.   Fundamentalists assume that ancient scripture contains the literal words of God and gives a faithful (or more or less faithful) account of real events. Neither of those ideas are supportable and have historically lead to some pretty awful outcomes.   Scripture is a human response to God, not the other way around.   Terryl Givens approach doesn't work because it still relies on those assumptions, albeit with softer rhetoric than typically employed in orthodox circles."

Fundamentalists assume that ancient scripture contains the literal words of God...   Well, it says things like ""God said to Noah, 'I am going to put an end to all people...'"".  I'm not saying that there is no argument to be made that it's possible that a world exists that aligns with a non-literalist reading of spiritual texts (although I personally don't buy those arguments).

They tell a story about a historical vault with a lock and keyhole, but no matter how hard a thief tried they would never be able to pick the lock, they would fail because it was a fake keyhole. The real keyhole was hidden behind a piece of moveable wood.   Meaning that if you approach truth question with the wrong assumption, you may never be able to get through the door, i.e. get the right answer. This is a great point. However, just as the OP mentions, they assert that they know the ""right"" keyhole, i.e. assumption, to pursue with no evidence.   No human knows the right assumptions to make about any sort of truth question. Jesus was right when he said ""the blind leading the blind"". So how can any of us cut through these questions? Find any way that might prove your idea wrong, and try it. Experiment like Alma 36 says, and make sure your results will come in a way that is independent of what you want to be true.   I tried the Givens' assumption, and I tried other assumptions when examining my Mormon beliefs. I explored as many keyholes as I could find.

If witches did exist; and had powers as advertised, the regular humans really would hunt them (and be hunted by them), something like the Mutants in X-men; because the power difference would be so great.

They don't pause to consider the morality of the tale about whether a complete destruction of humanity via the familiar tale of the biblical flood is based at all in reality, or the consequences of making a ultimately-genocidal decision like that.   This interview shows me that they are both jumping at the chance to show how many books they've read, and how their analysis somehow make sense. Yea, for them if they can get these amoral tales to work in any rational context! To me it shows if rational thought is sacrificed by the first instance of suspension of disbelief, then the rest fall into place. After the first nibble, the next bite is easier. Then onto full on fundamentalism and buying into the whole of Smith's irrational universe where the god of mormonism is as capricious as portrayed in the Old Testament, the Book of Mormon, and D&C 132. As capricious as making sure would-be apostles find quarters along the side of the road for chicken wings while simultaneously allowing famine, poverty, warlords and slavery. The best the Givens can do is collectively throw up their hands and say, ""Oh, well."" Fiona's comment about the mormon god doing things we don't know about is among the most absurd statements of benefits of the doubt given to deity. There are so many machinations required to believe in mormonism! A belief in a god with a simple non-interference directive is much easier to swallow. However, beliefs like that don't keep the faithful in the pews and paying their tithes to the corporation.  Download mp3"

mormon,3cgu5a,mostlypertinant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:02:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't agree with everything....   Would you classify yourself as a fundamentalist? Do you believe in a literal flood, no death before the fall, a literal pair of humans in a garden and the rest (including D&C 77) that defines the tenets of the faith?  If your belief in the idea of a ""god who weeps"" is more based in metaphor, then I would classify you as out of the mainstream. The believers are mostly cafeteria mormons, but the doctrine is actually quite clearly defined at lds.org, even though most of the faithful won't claim all of it. The still lean fundamentalist/literalist in the main. I am curious where your belief lies, because as I said, the first nibble of suspension of disbelief leads to their fundamentalist claims in total. For me, mormonism offers a competing narrative to science. They both can't be correct. That doesn't stop the believers from applying significant dissonance and gymnastics to keep their world view intact."

He'd be crying that I got a mountain bike and he was still stuck with a little kids bike. I'd tell him that I'm actually jealous that he still gets to ride the little bike. I'd try to make up reasons why I wish I was still small enough to ride the little bike and how the mountain bike was less fun.  When I hear the men get up there and say things like, 'the real backbone of the church is the women and the most important job is having kids and raising them' I always think of how I would try to pump up my little brother's crappy toy to make him feel better that he couldn't have the stuff I did since I was older.   Hey ladies, you don't want these magical priesthood healing powers and the ability to see into the future. Being the leaders of the church and households is far less desirable than the amazing things you women get to do. You get to give birth to children and then care for them. Us guys sure wish we could do that. We'd trade places in a heart beat but unfortunately God chose you for all the cool jobs and we get stuck with all the power and authority.   Wait a second, you're telling me that none of the women are dumb enough to believe that? Well I should have known it wouldn't work. It didn't work on my brother either after he turned 5."

I want her to nail her 99 theses to the fucking door of the Salt Lake Temple, singing at the top of her voice, leading an entire army of Relief Society presidents, Beehives, organists in righteous protest.

mormon,3cd09x,WillyPete,6,Wed Jul 8 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"What man could want any greater glory or tribute than that which comes from an appreciative and loving wife?  From the beginning God has made it clear that man is very special, and he has also very clearly defined his position, his duties, and his destiny in the divine plan. Paul said that woman is the image and glory of God, and that man is the glory of the woman.  It is interesting to note that when executives of companies look for new employees, they always want to know what kind of husband a woman has. This seems to be very important. In the Church when women are being considered for new leadership offices, the question is always raised about the worthiness of the husband and whether or not he can give her full support.  And boys, don’t underestimate your influence on your sisters and your sweethearts. As you live worthy of their love and respect you can help greatly to determine that they will be clean and virtuous, successful and happy. Always remember that you can go much further on respect than on popularity.  As men realize the importance of the home and family, and with their wives keep the commandments of God to multiply and replenish the earth, to love the Lord and their neighbors as themselves, to teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before him, then will their joy be increased and their blessings multiplied to the extent that they will hardly be able to contain them."

The local troops that were just community based were always much more active, much more involved, and produced some really great young men. On the other hand the church troops were half in scouts half in the church YM's program and never seemed to really do as much.   The church should encourage participation, as it is a great program but it shouldn't be combined with church programs as that is what makes it suck."
mormon,3cd7zv,M00glemuffins,4,Tue Jul 7 16:19:32 2015 UTC,Having scouts so heavily connected to YM and church ruined it for me.  I ended up quitting scouts even though I liked it because I hated YM's so much. It was too weird doing scouts when I wasn't going to church very much. They started treating me super nice and one of the kids told me he had been assigned to try to fellowship me and get me back to church. Even at that young age I realized how shitty that type of manipulation was.

However one of the main draws of scouting in my ward was that is wasn't churchy. We didn't have testimony sharing on camp outs, no prayers, or anything religious, just boys having fun. I have reservations about the church having their own program as I can see it become just another church meeting.   I think there's good value in having a non-LDS program, if not scouting then something else."
mormon,3cd7zv,amertune,3,Tue Jul 7 01:50:39 2015 UTC,I've seen some areas move away from this. Some scout troops are even planning their own week long summer camp that is more of a gospel camp than a scout camp.

By virtue of the majority being silent there is no way to gauge such a question without a professional statistician doing a thorough study and only a very small handful of individuals actually qualified to answer it. Even if such a person were to do such a study the study would have to be redone cross regionally in order to get a world view. Certainly there are individuals that would like to see the church end it's affiliation with scouting and others who fully endorse it's association.  I do not doubt that you had confirmation from parents you associated with. People tend to affiliate with those who have similar convictions and feelings.  Please be aware that a fully active boy in the church does not need to affiliate with scouts in order to be a member. The obligation to scouting is a matter of peer pressure and possibly local policy but not a matter of doctrine that would jeopardize the boys standing in the church.

So not only did JS jr get led astray in writing it, but later presidencies and members were fooled into sustaining it as scripture.    The conclusion from that is why the church will never repeal 132, even if it is the most damning part of the religion, as it makes it obvious that you cannot trust canon.

In the preface of that volume, Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams — then the First Presidency — specifically justified the inclusion of the Lectures:  ""We deem it to be unnecessary to entertain you with a lengthy preface to the following volume, but merely to say, that it contains in short, the leading items of the religion which we have professed to believe.

Joseph was wrong on polygamy, Brother Brigham got it wrong with hating on blacks, but the church is totally true and led by god.  Color me bewildered.  EDIT:  I just read his response to one of the comments.  I think he mirrors my thoughts exactly (though unintentionally)   Look, if you think prophets have to perfectly keep all the commandments of God then there's never been such thing as a true prophet--ever.    If I believed in god, I might not think that his prophets had to be perfect.  But for a prophet to lay out scripture as if he were speaking with god's voice, and to even threaten his own wife with destruction if she didn't bow to god's will, well, if god allows something that far from his true intentions, how can I know what his true intentions are?"
mormon,3cblcn,cenosillicaphobiac,2,Tue Jul 7 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"I think the internal logic of the belief system can make sense.    A God exists who wants/needs/is indifferent but knows the universe requires faith to gain access to a unique source of power. This God calls prophets to teach this message, but humans are so stupid and weak, the prophets end up screwing up a lot, even though they're teaching the core message.  These fallible prophets actually make having faith in the message challenging worthwhile because everything doesn't align so easily that everyone believes.  In spite of the prophets' imperfections, the evidences of faith exist for those who pursue it.   I used to believe all these points, basically a more fleshed out version of the quote you quote, but when I really started examining the evidences of faith, I became increasingly convinced they would be able to support any arbitrary belief.   I guess what I'm saying is, I understand why that quote makes sense in the Mormon worldview and I believed it for years. And like you say in your last paragraph, once you take a step out of that worldview and ask some critical questions, although internally consistent, the idea of fallible prophets (and the sometimes egregiously harmful ways they have been fallible) provides some strong evidence to view Mormon prophetic claims the same way we view other contemporary prophetic claims--with skepticism."

mormon,3cblcn,cenosillicaphobiac,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Why do we exist?   I think the reasoning is backwards (we have a lot of evidence that we exist and very little evidence that God exists), but it makes a lot of sense from an historical anthropological perspective or a psychological perspective. A belief in (your community's) God gives some great social and psychological benefits."
mormon,3cblcn,ApostateFarmer,3,Wed Jul 8 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"Why do we exist?    Does there have to be a reason?  I haven't found one, that doesn't mean I don't exist.   A belief in (your community's) God gives some great social and psychological benefits.    It also can, and usually does, have some great social and especially psychological drawbacks."
mormon,3cblcn,Epicpompeii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"I was answering this question.    Why do people think this god exists?   I don't believe God exists, and I don't think there are falsifiable reasons to believe God exists. But I think it makes a lot of sense why humans would think god exists."
mormon,3cblcn,WillyPete,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"I was pretty brief in my response, so perhaps I didn't acknowledge that I realized you were speaking from a position not of belief but of explanation for why others might believe.  I was pretty sure from your comments that you were in my camp of non-belief.  My response was simply to say that I get why people might still believe, but that I wasn't letting them off the hook because those reasons are substandard from my viewpoint."

mormon,3cbwf8,cenosillicaphobiac,2,Mon Jul 6 21:04:49 2015 UTC,It was definitely a low point in the conversation. It was inflammatory and contributed nothing. The Bishop and member of the Stake Presidency were both eager to shut him down.
mormon,3cbwf8,cenosillicaphobiac,6,Mon Jul 6 21:44:02 2015 UTC,I just worry about all the potential harm this guy generated when he was practicing.  How many gay clients did he harm?

He was always a nice guy to me (but I'm not gay...). Taught me how to do body work on my parent's car after I wrecked it.  I think that his area of specialty was eating disorders (at least for a time). It is a scary thought to consider potential damage he could have done (or did) though."
mormon,3cbwf8,cenosillicaphobiac,2,Mon Jul 6 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"So, out of curiosity, do you think the church is doing the right thing by reminding the congregations that they hate gay sex or should they have just let it drop?   I would say, since they are going to end up reversing their position in a few years, it was foolish to double down yet again.  But what do I know?"
mormon,3cbwf8,cenosillicaphobiac,2,Mon Jul 6 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"It's such a muddy issue. Part of me wants to take the easy way out and just watch from the sidelines.   I'm not sure that issue is only that ""they hate gay sex"", (I assume you were using some hyperbole) I think this and other statements represent an effort to maintain a ""traditional"" way of life. Additionally, as a previous commenter said, I think that after the prop.8 debacle, the high-ups are maybe trying to avoid a degree of government involvement (at least on a national level).   I struggle with all of these statements because in the past, the church itself was very anti-government involvement when polygamy was part of the doctrine.   In my opinion, one of the ""right things"" the church did was to include their encouragement to members to love one another regardless of orientation. That reminder of a fundamental element of Christianity is a step (baby step?) in the right direction.   We'll see if steps like that continue forward."
mormon,3cbwf8,redblazingdragon,6,Mon Jul 6 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"I just feel so sad for the people that struggle.  Life is too short, and if, like me, you believe that this life is all you get, it really sucks to spend your whole life denying yourself one of life's really great things.  It comes down to Pascal's wager, in reverse.  If it turns out to not be true, what have you missed in your life?  I guess the nihilist in me says it doesn't really matter because you're dead so you will have no regrets, but being happy breeds happiness in others.  I just want to see people be happy and I fear that the church stifles that.  EDIT:  I also have seen the church be DRAMATICALLY wrong in the past, with no apology or explanation later on.  I wonder why the brethren are so fucking sure that they got this one right, when it doesn't appear they even have the motivation to ask the question.  Shouldn't their history encourage them to be more cautious before claiming such perfect knowledge of god's will and intended direction?"
mormon,3cbwf8,cenosillicaphobiac,4,Mon Jul 6 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent points. It seems like a sad consolation that LGBTQ members can be ""fully"" involved in the church as long as they remain chaste (celibate). That's a tough spot to be in. If I were told that I could not have sex for the rest of my life just to make God happy and get into heaven, I would seriously consider hell and enjoy my life.   My current question: ""why try to be a member of a club that doesn't want you?""."

It seems like a sad consolation that LGBTQ members can be ""fully"" involved in the church as long as they remain chaste (celibate).    That's not even completely true.  Is it chaste to hold hands your significant other if you aren't married?  How about an innocent peck on the cheek in the same situation?  LGBTQ are denied even this basic level of human dignity in church and on campus of church owned schools.   If I were told that I could not have sex for the rest of my life just to make God happy and get into heaven, I would seriously consider hell and enjoy my life.    You would be accused of being too lazy to be a good Mormon, having been offended, or simply ""wanting to sin"".  Those are the accusations leveled at most ex-Mormons.  I myself felt that the church's truth claims lacked enough credibility to keep me (see how I flipped the tables there?  It's not my fault that I'm not a member, the church failed in it's most basic responsibility) and so I started looking at actions as actions and not as potential sins.  It's been freeing to say the least.  I didn't quit because I wanted to sin, I quit, and decided that the church's narrative on sin wasn't applicable."

And if they did eventually get it right, how far did they lag behind the rest of society?  I can't think of one single thing that the church has been progressive on.  All of the things you mentioned, as well as slut shaming, archaic views on masturbation, modesty shaming, oppressive polygamy, the list goes on and on.  Again, to reiterate, I cannot thing of one single thing the church was ahead of the curve on.  Oh wait, they were ahead of the game on women's suffrage, but for purely selfish reasons, it had nothing to do with actually thinking a woman should have a say in politics, but everything to do with needing a larger voting bloc."

mormon,3cbwf8,taho_teg,8,Mon Jul 6 20:35:45 2015 UTC,But why is it such a big issue in the US?  When the state ruled gay marriage legal in Holland there was no statement from the first presidency that needed to be shared.  I think this has more to do with the fact that the church  took action against in the US and lost the battle whereas they weren't involved in the politics of Holland at all.     The church itself was involved in the battle against gay marriage and they requested the time and money of its members to join this battle.

mormon,3c9kvs,muucavwon,3,Mon Jul 6 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I'm a hard-core exmo, but I try very hard to be polite as ****.  /r/Mormon sucks. I think the two main reasons are first, the voting imbalances that favor exmo ideas over tbm or even nom ideas as the OP mentions and second, the projection of one's beliefs onto the world at large that both exmos and mormons engage in.  This sub is boring and constrained. Very few mormons want to post here because of the voting issue and almost all conversations devolve into vitriolic debates due to both sides attempts at defeating their ""enemy"". Because of the exmo numbers advantage, exmo voices usually win out in those debates, and mormons leave.   Look, we all believe we are right. Who holds a belief that they don't believe is true? That is tautologically impossible. The goal of dialogue and comment threads should be exchange of information and understanding--it should not be proving your worldview matches the ""true"" world. Why? Because the people who are here to accept your proof are individuals, with their own thoughts, ideas, and knowledge and if you don't convince them it may not be because they are stupid or ignorant or unreasonable.  My proposition to solve this problem is probably not popular, but I really think it would solve some of the biggest problems with /r/mormon. If everyone explicitly mentioned that what they post is their interpretation of the world, based on certain information they find compelling, it would prevent these mildly entertaining flame wars that dominate (the little content on) this sub.  For example, ""I consider faith to be a harmful principle, whether or not God supports it, because in almost every case of someone having faith in a false idea, it encourages them to continue on in that false idea."" I've said something that it pretty critical of Mormonism and religion, but I doubt any believer is going to flame me for it because I have included those two little words at the beginning. If I leave out those words, I'm implicitly saying, ""If you disagree with this, you are wrong"" and no matter who you are, or what your belief is, you feel a strong emotional drive to refute truth assertions that you disagree with.  Will /r/mormon change? I doubt it. But I'll still post here occasionally, attempting to follow my own proposition and downvoting only personal attacks--not poor reasoning, silly arguments, or statements I disagree with."

mormon,3c9d5x,IranRPCV,3,Mon Jul 6 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"Listening now...  The Community of Christ's position with respect to literal golden plates, literal Book of Mormon peoples, etc. is interesting. Bryant states this, but it is obviously false within the origins of the Latter Day Saint movement:    [Seth Bryant @ 1:16:23] ...Scripture never claims to be a history book.   That is simply not true with respect to the Latter Day Saint movement. Contrast against the original truth claims of Joseph Smith and his witnesses that signed statements about the plates:   [Statement of the eight witnesses]: ...And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.   Physical objects have mass. The eight witnesses reportedly ""hefted"" them. They sound ""real"" to me. Unless, someone was lying, or being deceived.  The Latter Day Saints are painted into a corner with this statement and their spectacular original truth claims go out the window with them. Those claims initially won them many new converts. Now that science is weighing in where only guesses could be made before some religions, such as the Community of Christ are attempting to pretend the claims were never made in the first place. Earlier in the podcast, Bryant also said that science and religion are not competing narratives. Unfortunately, for the Latter Day Saints that is just not a supportable position. The Community of Christ have put their best spin on scripture; perhaps, the best spin that can be applied. Namely, they have added to their scriptural canon that their god prefers for humans not to engage in proof-texting scriptural battles. That is so much spin that it points the Community of Christ in a direction 180 degrees from the ambitions of Smith's original restoration. Where Smith's early followers assumed he had a direct conduit to god and that his restoration was genuine, the modern CoC variant has punted the ball. They no longer claim to be the one true church. When they dropped that claim, they should have also jettisoned themselves from association with the restoration movement, too. But, in practice, they clearly haven't. They read from the Book of Mormon in their services and at least some of the followers likely believe it to be describing literal events. The spin they have applied may work for some, but for me it is a very odd blending of protestantism and mormonism. The two are oil and water. Take this statement made by the founder:   [JS History 1] 18 My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)—and which I should join. 19 I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: “they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.”   Gordon B. Hinckley offered a much better synopsis than that offered up by the Community of Christ that the Latter Day Saint movement is still ""truthy"" enough despite being tied to Smith's tall tales.   [Hinckley]: ...Our whole strength rests on the validity of that vision. It either occurred or it did not occur. If it did not, then this work is a fraud. If it did, then it is the most important and wonderful work under the heavens.   The Community of Christ is interesting in its approach, especially its openness to feminist and LGBTQ ideals, and its community building efforts. One wonders whether their fracture with the Latter Day Saint movement would have been better if they simply could have jettisoned the overarching dogmas, including the ""prophets"" of the old testament, the idea for the need for a savior who was punished by proxy for our sins, and especially Joseph Smith's unsupportable claims, and dropped the idea of man speaking one-on-one with god carrying a ""mantle"" of prophecy. One wonders, could a community be built without the need for not only not pledging allegiance and belief in certain dogmas, as the Community of Christ have done, but also by tossing the majority, or even all, of the dogma itself? Is the dogma necessary? Is worship necessary?    My short essay on why The Community of Christ is not a simple rebranding of Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It is more like a business that went under without ever posting a ""going out of business"" sign."
mormon,3c9d5x,4blockhead,2,Mon Jul 6 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"They no longer claim to be the one true church. When they dropped that claim, they should have also jettisoned themselves from association with the restoration movement, too. But, in practice, they clearly haven't.   No, we haven't.  It is part of our history, and to deny this would be to be dishonest about how we came to be a community.   One wonders, could a community be built without the need for not only not pledging allegiance and belief in certain dogmas, as the Community of Christ have done, but also by tossing the majority, or even all, of the dogma itself? Is the dogma necessary? Is worship necessary?   Let me understand what you mean by the word ""Dogma"".  If it is a test, that is something that must be confessed to in order to claim membership in good standing, then no.  I believe we have gotten rid of it.  What is important to us is working together to build community.  By definition, we will have to include people different from ourselves if this is to become universal.  I view the work of Community of Christ to be about reconcilation - both of individuals and institutions."
mormon,3c9d5x,IranRPCV,2,Mon Jul 6 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"I won't argue semantics with you. Dogma is the whole tradition that a church is built on. It includes its canon. The old testament is part of their canon. Their view of god as trinitarian is definitely dogma/canon. This interview made it clear that the CoC has official positions. Members are free to individually disagree with bits and pieces, but if they are teaching a lesson or representing the priesthood or church, or could be confused as doing so, then they must state that is not the official doctrine, only their own viewpoint. In the interview, it became clear I would not qualify for inclusion/baptism/confirmation into the CoC because I am not sure Christ was a real person, let alone that I don't believe in John 1:14 in any sense. That is what I mean by dogma. It exists whether one recognizes it as one thing, or wants to continue to play word games.  It is a weird experience attending the Community of Christ. On one hand, you see they're inclusive. On the other hand, they're still tied to the dogma of the bible and the dogma of the Book of Mormon. They apparently picked over and rejected some doctrines that Smith created post Kirtland, especially polygamy and polytheism. Their formation 16 years after the death of Joseph Smith gave them some time to re-evaluate their new foundation. Those changes were minor by way of comparison to the wholesale changes that were introduced leading up to the name change to the Community of Christ and inclusion in the NCC, alongside the Quakers as another peace church. Ambiguity is still at the heart of it. Their claim of no proof texting battles is a way to mute criticism in general of Smith's original truth claims. All of this is dogma associated with the ""restoration"" and the Latter Day Saint movement.  It's hard to tell, but I am quite sure they don't claim to be the one-true-church. If they did, then their participation in the NCC would be at jeopardy. That council, as I understand it, requires a belief in a trinitarian god and Jesus as savior, etc. Exclusive claims of special truths of any one church in the council sound problematic. The NCC was fine with the CoC continuing to use the BoM as a piece of fan fiction as long as it was de-emphasized somewhat. I'm not sure what the CoC said to get the NCC to overlook Smith's non-ecumenical statements in his 1838 first vision account."
mormon,3c9d5x,4blockhead,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"No, I am not arguing meaning, I am trying to clarify a point, which is if you understand dogma as meaning something that must be accepted to be a member?    In fact, if you were already baptized in the LDS church your baptism would be accepted for membership in Community of Christ, a point that I don't think was clear from the interview.   In the interview, it became clear I would not qualify for inclusion/baptism/confirmation into the CoC because I am not sure Christ was a real person, let alone that I don't believe in John 1:14 in any sense.   This is a misunderstanding.  I know many members, some in leadership positions, who would be disqualified from membership  if such opinions were disqualifying.  Let me introduce you to F. Henry Edwards who I knew rather well.  He served the church as an Apostle and as a counselor to Israel A. Smith and to W. Wallace Smith in the First Presidency.  His position as a conscientious objector during World War I was an early expression of the Peace witness within the Church.  In the 1930s he wrote Fundamentals: Enduring Convictions of the Restoration, which was a very influential statement of RLDS theology and dogma.    In the mid 70s I had several long conversations with him.  He told me that he had denied the church permission to republish it.  He said that while he was proud of what he had written then, that no one should believe that his thinking had not progressed.  He said he had moved on, and so should the church.  I also know his son, Paul M. Edwards, who married my wife and I.  He is a distinguished scholar, especially on the history of the Korean War, (quite unlike his father) and wrote Toom Taggard, a novel from which you could infer a lot regarding his personal beliefs.  In spite of his sceptical approach to faith, he was asked to serve as director of the RLDS Temple School in Independence, Missouri.    You would find some of my closest friends in the church to have much more agreement with your statement than you might suspect.  In our D&C 163 are the words    There are many issues that could easily consume the time and energy of the church. However, the challenge before a prophetic people is to discern and pursue what matters most for the journey ahead.   Section 164 has these words:   The mission of Jesus Christ is what matters most for the journey ahead.   It should be clear that arguing about matters of belief is not what matters to us as much as it once did.  Anyone interested in the mission of justice, healing and freedom that Christ first announced when he read from Isaiah in the Temple is welcome to take their place in the church, even if there is skepticism on details of belief that we frankly waste far too much time and energy on.  If you are truly interested in justice and wholeness, as I believe your posts passionately show, you could have a place with us, should you so choose.    I also think there are many other places where you could find opportunities to exercise your talents, but it would be too bad if you thought you wouldn't be welcome with us.  Edit:  I just read your comment you quoted from a previous post:   The silver lining is Hamer's church of only 20 to 25 have taken on the mantle of christendom. Their central city church has provided shelter for 200+ homeless people in the Toronto central city district.   You get it.  This is where we are called to put our energy - not in self justification."

Okay, but the way Smith framed his case, having real plates from a real people appeared to be integral to his narrative. He went as far as having two sets of witnesses to bolster his case. If Smith had only known that people would still bite into his story and take it down hook, line, and sinker, then could have saved himself a lot of trouble by setting the entire story in a galaxy, far, far away and have said, Use the force, Luke! to answer every question of doctrine.

They want to say they first kissed their spouse across the altar from one another in the temple, just like Spencer W. Kimball's perfunctory kiss of Camilla. Oh, I forgot.

mormon,3c6kbp,dahlia_gatz,3,Sun Jul 5 12:25:48 2015 UTC,"Modesty:  noun, plural modesties. 1. the quality of being modest; freedom from vanity, boastfulness, 2.regard for decency of behavior, speech, dress, etc. 3. simplicity; moderation.  In reading and searching through those articles and all referenced articles and everything referenced from modesty I thought I would pull out all the scriptures and direct quotes from prophets and see what that actually leads to if anything.   So there was   Alma 1:27 - the most referenced one   And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.   1 Corinthians 3:16   Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?   D&C 93:35   The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple.   1 Peter 3:3-4:   Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.   1 Timothy 2:9-10    In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;  But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.   D&C 42:40-41   And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands; And let all things be done in cleanliness before me.   2 Nephi 28:13   They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are puffed up.   Mosiah 10:5    And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land—thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.   Jacob 2:19   And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.   D&C 121:41,43 (no power or influence by virtue of the priesthood ..); Isaiah 61:10 (God clothing us with garment of salvation and robe of righteousness); Genesis 2:21 (God clothing Adam and Eve with coats of skin); Matthew 25:36 (I was naked and ye clothed me); Mosiah 4:26 (impart substance to the poor; including clothing the naked)   Modesty in dress and manner will assist in protecting against temptation. It may be difficult to find modest clothing, but it can be found with enough effort. … You can be attractive without being immodest. … Draw some rigid parameters, a line in the sand, as it were, beyond which you will not go.”    President Gordon B. Hinckley, “Stay on the High Road,” Liahona and Ensign, May 2004, 114.    “How truly beautiful is a well-groomed young woman who is clean in body and mind. She is a daughter of God in whom her Eternal Father can take pride. … Be true to your own convictions. You know what is right, and you know what is wrong. You know when you are doing the proper thing” (New Era, Jan. 2001, 11, 14).   This one is going to seem random, but actually 'On My Honor' was referenced more than once:    Let me confess one of the sad disappointments I sometimes feel: The returned missionary who, after two years of taking great pride in how he looks and what he represents, returns to this campus or some other similar place to see how quickly he can let his hair grow, how fully he can develop a moustache and long sideburns and push to the very margins of appropriate grooming, how clumpy his shoes get, how tattered his clothes are, how close to being grubby he can get without being refused admittance to the school. That, my young returned missionary brethren, is one of the great disappointments in my life.    On My Honor Kimball April 1979  In fact, given the importance that 'On My Honor' had in terms of justification it should be read in its entirety. It was originally a devotional address to BYU, it references the BYU honor code, Elder Oaks and Holland (this was in 1979) and the justification for the missionaries dressing as they do as being:   Then sometimes these great leaders say, “Your missionaries look like just the kind of young men I would want in my business, or in my government, or in my embassy, or in my law firm.” Sometimes they even say, “They look just like the young man I would like for a son-in-law.” That makes me proudest of all.   So as far as I can tell that is the entire foundation of the edifice upon which ""porn shoulders"" are built; I leave the connection between that foundation and ""porn shoulders"" as an exercise for the reader."
mormon,3c6kbp,JohnH2,6,Sun Jul 5 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"I would go so far as to argue that once Mormon dress standards cross into ""peculiar people"" territory, they could thereby become immodest. And there's certainly irony in all the of the church publications assuring young women that they can dress according to Mormon dress standards while still being fashionable (and calling this ""modesty""). This irony is only compounded when one reflects on Jesus' criticisms of the Pharisees."
mormon,3c6kbp,mormbn,4,Sun Jul 5 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"The trend is in the date of publication in those magazines. There was nothing said about scriptures, indeed if we were to follow them, being without a coat, or women without a headcovering would be immodest."

mormon,3c6kbp,Chantrea,3,Sun Jul 5 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a shame that the question about modesty has become a bit ""pharisaic"" in that it focuses on the detail more than the spirit of it.   I always thought it was hard when I was a teenager, and ended up starting to sew my own clothes (especially ball gowns etc) which was very hard to find. Now that I'm a bit older though (26) I appreciate a lot more of what modesty means and I can see the ""ring effects"" of choosing to dress modestly.   Dressing modestly does in fact give a sort of freedom because you have to let go of some of your vanity and it allows you to focus on practicality and comfort instead of being sexy or fashionable.  Not having to constantly pull my skirts down, worry about bending to pick stuff up or showing too much while leaning over the table is actually pretty good! Not wearing super tight clothes is also a lot more comfortable.   Women's fashion is often not practical or comfortable and makes it harder to get things done. I used to wear knee length skirts, now I prefer midi or full length because I can sit down in the grass or on the floor without being super awkward and having to keep my knees together at all times! I can run up a flight of stairs without worrying if someone can see my but and I can sit down without my butcrack showing above my skinny jeans.   Mostly I'm just glad it's helped me realise that I shouldn't spend so much time worrying about how I look (as long as I and my clothes are clean..) and whether or not I'm sexy or attractive, but rather care about what I do with my life, what I choose to spend time on and what's important to me, and which parts of me give me value other than my looks.  Unfortunately the main focus in a lot of articles etc. seems to be ""don't look sexy"" which is a bit problematic when kids don't know what sexy is and teenagers really only want confirmation that they are sexy..."

If a body feels it necessary to teach some form of dress is modest, what is there to prevent all out covering in the pursuit of modesty.    I'm not saying you approve of their message, simply that your own reasons for more modest styles are frequently used by those in the burka to justify the male dominance of how they dress."

And if you want to think about male dominance in dressing consider how we dress in the western world, and the extreme pressure women are under.  Did you ever think about the reason there is not too much emphasis on men in the church dressing modestly? Because they culturally already do! (Mostly) In what way is it fair that men are expected to wear loose fitted clothing that's usually modest off the rack while women are somehow ""dominated"" or ""not free"" when they choose to do the same?  Where is the equality of men wearing suits, only showing the skin on their hands and face to weddings, parties etc while women wear short, tight dresses, both uncomfortable and impractical, putting the main focus on her looks and body, leaving her insecure about her skin, weight, proportions etc. and becoming objectified in the eyes of others as well as herself. Is that fair? Is that equality?   When it comes to the way we dress our culture is just as messed up as that of most Muslims, maybe even more."

My daughters came to that conclusion in grade school and there was no ""modesty"" requirement put on them.  It's not dressing modestly that gives that freedom you mention, it's being your own person that gives you that.  The self-confidence and assurance needed to dress to please yourself doesn't come from following standards imposed from outside yourself and make no mistake ""modesty"" standards are just as much an outside requirement as ""fashion"" standards.  You find ""modesty"" standards freeing others find it freeing to run the gamut of women's fashion according to circumstances or whim."

That's my biggest beef with the Bloggernacle:  their concern for their own status in the LDS meritocracy seems to trump the responsibility to let the rank-and-file hear from faithful members who know the score about the Book of Mormon.

mormon,3c5qqs,mostlypertinant,2,Sun Jul 5 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree the church in total will see no mandated changes to their religious practice. Specific details of religious practice are guaranteed by the bill of rights of the US Constitution, as limited by Reynolds. What is not guaranteed is tax dollars going to pay for programs at discriminating universities. If the 1978 reversal on race had not come when it did, would BYU have been allowed to continue to offer second class status to blacks while still accepting government subsidies for tuition in the form of Pell Grants? We'll see if BYU sees any fallout from this decision. My guess is it is extremely likely in the next five years. All it needs is a test case where the first legally married gay couple are turned away on ""moral"" grounds. Holding homosexual unions to a different standard than heterosexual unions is obviously discriminatory per the decision in Obergefell. It is a direct corollary to Loving v. Virginia. If BYU wants the tax subsidies, then they're going to have to fall in line with societal expectations. If they don't want the tax subsidies, then they can continue on as if nothing has changed.  It will also be a test case to see if when hard currency is on the table whether the brethren see the light and come into the twenty-first century with the rest of us, albeit with some kicking and screaming. If they don't, then It will be interesting to see if BYU athletics begins to see boycotts from state sponsored schools, or arising at the grass roots level like what happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s about BYU's inherent racism. The players from the University of Wyoming, the University of Texas at El Paso, Stanford, and others were putting pressure that BYU would not be scheduled as an opponent. Then came the 1978 declaration that fixed that problem with a stroke of a pen. I wonder, how long will it take for some to begin calling out BYU on their inherent homophobia? It's going to happen, in my opinion.    Here are the court cases that I thought were most relevant in the lead up to the Obergefell decision."

At this point in time, the scientific studies point to sexual attraction not being binary, but rather, a scale.  Some people are more attracted to people of the same sex or gender (a whole nother ball of wax) as them, others to the opposite.  Studies are being done to find a gene responsible for it, to my knowledge it hasn't been isolated, but that doesn't, in and of itself, prove that being gay is something a person simply chooses to do.  The evidence against that being the case is over fucking whelming and to deny it is true confirmation bias and burying of heads in sand.  Are you claiming otherwise?

I read that they intend to read it to men separately from the women separately from the young men separately from the young women etc etc. Are they ACTUALLY going to separate families before reading a letter about families? I must be confused.  I left 11 years ago, and while I'm happy being an atheist, I have always defended my Mormon friends/family. The problems I see with the Church are more to do with the administration and not the members. I am hoping that, regardless of what is coming down the pipeline, members continue to search within themselves, to speak openly with their closest loved ones, and truly decide if they feel that it is right to be forced to listen to speech you believe is wrong. I believe there is something said about God not allowing a prophet to lead you astray.... Sounds to me like God gifted you with the power of prayer and conscience which would help you stand up for what you believe, whatever that may be. As much as I'd love to see it, I am not advocating for some kind of massive protest or open rebellion, only that everyone place the message of JESUS CHRIST, for whom the church is named, before the message of anyone else. Christ said ""As I have loved you, love one another - by this shall man know ye are my disciples."" Right now the Mormon church does not look like it is a host of Christ's disciples. Right now many of its these ""disciples"" look like they are trying to start Westboro Mormon Church. I know that there is great confusion, and I don't expect my conservative friends to suddenly think it's okay for gays to be together. I do hope, however, that they will at least take a moment to regroup and have conversations with those who oppose them (and vice-versa!), and more importantly, with those who are DIRECTING (not guiding, but directing) them.

This could be a response to woman asking to be  involved in decision making in church. Still under the direction of the Bishop but this could be a placating move. The idea the sisters brought up were to make sacrament meeting play kits for all the primary kids. I think this idea will flop. It is a lot of work and the kits will quickly be lost etc with out increaseing reverance. Plan sacrament meeting 3 months in advance. One ward wanted members to write out their talks and turn into the Bishop before they are given. I think this idea will flop. But it could be a move to over see sacrament meeting content.

I know the church doesn't have, and won't have, a paid clergy, but they desperately need to amp-up the quality of the sacrament meeting speakers if they want to stem the tide of waning attendance."
mormon,3by97a,Zadok_The_Priest,2,Sat Jul 4 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"<rant>  This! Even as a TBM, I get so tired of sacrament meetings sometimes because the speakers are so ill-prepared and it's really not enjoyable for anyone. As a nominal member of the bishopric in a student ward, I came up with an invitation to speak with some orientation, advice, and tips for speakers. Still though, I feel like it was just a drop in the bucket. The quality of the talks has only increased marginally at best. I feel like it would be much more productive to have activities at a ward or stake level that actually train Church members on public speaking every couple of months, like a Toastmasters style format.  </rant>"

Meanwhile in LDS chapels Timmy's grandma fumbles through I am a Child of God and doesn't even use the pedals or decent stops.  If I wanted to go to a church again, I would want to go to one with music that inspires awe. Not music that makes me cringe."

mormon,3by97a,Ua_Tsaug,3,Fri Jul 3 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly from what I've seen it's usually either because a: they're trying to play the organ like a piano, get thrown off by the feel because it ISN'T a piano and slow down. Or b: they're trying to use the pedals but never learned how to properly and are playing slow to give them time to look down and find what their feet are supposed to hit."
mormon,3by97a,M00glemuffins,5,Fri Jul 3 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  Because both instruments, (piano and organ) both have black and white keys arranged in the same order, the assumption is that if you can play one, you can just as easily play the other.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The technique is totally different, the touch is different, the correct playing is different.  I can usually tell in the first measure if the organist was trained on the piano, and trying to make the transition.    And as someone who was trained on the organ from the beginning, I couldn't play a piano if my life depended on it."

I remember when Josh Marshall shut down the TPM cafe (there used to be a forum component to Talking Points Memo that afforded folks the chance to interact directly with some pretty brilliant guests, much like an AMA).  Folks were disappointed but it was always Josh's place and it'd be poor form to wail too loudly about losing a forum that didn't cost us anything to use.

Insofar as social media enterprises bill themselves as ""community,"" they are proposing a sort of social contract with those who decide to invest in that community. Exactly what the bounds of that are (or should be) has yet to be fully explored. It may be that capital-founded community is simply not a great approach.   Imagine if, when the old media conglomerates were first organizing, someone had asked ""is this right--is this good for humanity?""

I mean, on the one hand, okay. But on the other hand, many churches have proven capable of engaging in institutional moral reasoning and changing positions over time. They just don't need to call it ""continuing revelation"" or to spend a lot of internal and external PR effort posturing about their authority and fundamental consistency.   I understand the desire to reinterpret Mormonism in a more positive way, but the moderate-liberal Mormon rhetoric about how amazing continuing revelation is makes the eyes roll.

Once marriage was on the table, now they have to step up the rhetoric to justify non-acceptance.    If ""married"" is really the validator it is for hetero sex, then it stands that gay sex is permitted in marriage."

Many of the members that support gay marriage are probably aware of the high suicide rate among young people who identify as gay. They are probably aware that conversion therapy is not only ineffective, but, is actually harmful. The support of gay marriage has become a metaphor to send a message, to those struggling to fit in, that we love you just the way you are.   The idea that people loving and supporting someone who isn't you, hurts you in your struggle, especially when a majority of TBM's support your slave-master fantasy, is an example of how ego takes over rational thinking.

It was an involuntary virtual sauna. I couldn't imagine what it was like for the sisters, so you couldn't really blame them for their trickery. It was probably too hot for the bats.

From about 100 AD until 1820, the true church of Jesus Christ and his priesthood was removed from the earth.  To the extent that Mormons give any thought to the early Christian Fathers (which is usually very little) they are considered to be wise men working with limited light and knowledge.  That being said, Mormons believe that God continued to inspire individuals throughout the Apostasy, and this belief is useful to explain some of the great things people accomplished during that time.  For example, LDS scriptures teach that Columbus was directly inspired by God to discover the Americas.  I've heard Mormons claim this inspiration for luminaries from Mozart to Joan of Arc.  So if a Mormon got to studying Augustine or Aquinas and found what he considered inspired truths, there is definitely room in his worldview to believe that these men were inspired by God.  However, they were not prophets and had no authority or keys of the priesthood.  Perhaps they had some small part to play in preparing the world for the eventual restoration of the true church by Joseph Smith, or maybe God simply saw fit to inspire these men in order to bless humanity during that dark time."

A big part of Mormon theology is personal revelation which comes from the gift of the Holy Ghost and the gift of prophesy.

However, Mormonism also occasionally looks to the Church Fathers as a source of apologetics--the idea being that wherever one of the Church Fathers can be construed to be in closer agreement with Mormonism than with modern Christianity, there is evidence that Jesus and/or the original apostles had taught Mormon doctrine that was later rejected or lost by the wider Christian movement."

It is someone politely expressing their disagreement with what we are saying.

The Mormon Church has it's tendrils in my government, my family and my entire community yet I can't leave it alone? I get love bombed, invited back to church, chastised for living my life and called to repentance?   If you have some kind of master solution for purging the religion from my life, I'd gladly hear it.

The oaths and penalties have also had significant changes. The changes in 1990 were substantial.  Not much about the second anointing ritual. I'll have to take another look to see if if addressed those items.

mormon,3bnmwf,apotheosis333,8,Tue Jul 7 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"What is and what isn't falsifiable?  That is the question.  Things that can't be 100% proven wrong are usually not real, but the downside to that is the believers willingly believe it...so they are going to be pretty much stay in that mindset.  Nobody can prove to 100% certainty that the Easter Bunny doesn't exist.  But no rational person believes in the Easter Bunny.  In my view, it is just as hard to believe that a man named Moroni, in wraith form, visited Joseph Smith multiple times.  BUT, I can't prove it didn't happen.  And you have the Mormon Gentry whose lifestyle has been built up and curated over decades and decades that has no interest in this fantasy showed to them as  being extremely unlikely.  You are right...   1: The answers only come from the spirit and 2: We won't know some things until we are dead.   That's all they need to keep their fantasy."
mormon,3bnmwf,enigmaticwanderer,5,Tue Jun 30 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"Good points.  Many times this comes down to the burden of proof/persuasion and the standard of evidence.   If party A is asking party B to change, party A should bear some burden.  The evidence party A brings forward should be subject to impeachment evidence and cross examination.    Before party B changes, they should be satisfied that party A has persuaded them to a suitable level.    In my case, if the Church wants me to continue serving it, saying I believe, and paying tithing, it bears the burden to demonstrate that there is probable cause to believe the Church is true in the way it claims to be true.  That is a much lower standard that some.  I'm not even asking for a coin toss.  I just need them to persuade me that there is a 20% chance or so that the Church is true in the way it says it is.  EDIT:  Right now I think there is about a 0.01% chance the Church is ""true"" in any meaningful way.   But that does not mean I don't see the value it brings to some people."
mormon,3bnmwf,greybab,6,Tue Jun 30 22:55:53 2015 UTC,I find it helps if you can first convince them of this. That other people of other religions believe just as hard in their god(s) and all the things that mormons laugh at as silly. Then ask them to try and look at the church from that perspective.
mormon,3bnmwf,Sophocles,8,Tue Jun 30 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yes - it makes for very frustrating conversation.  The honest truth is the religions in general are fast running out of answers in the age of science.  What was once easily believed can now be easily dismissed.    I really think you can't expect satisfying intellectual answers to any of your questions.  Having had, as you have, myriad conversations with believers about this it always falls back onto ""You just have to believe"" or ""Well it makes me happy"".  They aren't satisfying if you want a rational answer as to why or how.    I'm sure this is a sad realization for you so I'm sorry you're experiencing this.  Forgone conclusions have never been rational and its very doubtful that they'll be made rational by further information."
mormon,3bnmwf,LtKije,4,Tue Jun 30 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"""Spiritual things must be understood spiritually.""  I think that is what it boils down to.  It's not just that a religious worldview is comprised of different ""facts"" than a secular worldview, but also different processes by which those facts are evaluated, and by which knowledge of those facts can be obtained.  We don't only disagree about what is real, but about how it can be known what is real.  This would be transparently self-serving if we encountered it anywhere else.  If a believer in astrology tried to argue that the reason there was no evidence for his beliefs was because astrological truths can only be properly understood and evaluated within an astrological worldview, then it's obvious what's going on.  Any belief can be defended as ""true"" if we are only allowed to evaluate it properly from within the belief system.  And yet when a religious believer makes essentially the same special pleading argument, it sounds a lot more sensible, because most of us were raised to believe that spirituality is a legitimate path to truth."
mormon,3bnmwf,Eazu,3,Wed Jul 1 17:13:13 2015 UTC,This is a great point.  And I think it's good for members to ask this question:   Would I accept the exact same argument I am making if it came from a member of a different religion or philosophical system.
mormon,3bnmwf,LtKije,6,Wed Jul 1 18:13:50 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that you - along with many other exmos and middle-grounders - hold a very different worldview than TBMs.  If you want to discuss something with a TBM, the onus is on you to play the cultural anthropologist and engage them within their own worldview. Demanding that your bishop, stake president, or family members adhere to your worldview is pointless, and seems kind of rude to me. It would be like going to a group of Hindu Yogis and demanding that they provide only rational and empirical arguments about how their prescribed meditation poses will help you achieve zen.   Or it's like bearing your testimony on /r/exmormon.  Why would a TBM want to adopt your worldview during a discussion? It doesn't help at all - because in their view YOU are the one with the problem. They're giving you the appropriate mormon answer - i.e. ""If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God,"" and ""We believe God will yet reveal many great and important things"" - and if that's not good enough for you, then you have to deal with it.  There are some of us that want a dialog, and have learned how to shift worldviews in order to talk to - and fully empathize with - TBMS, exmos, and the middle-grounders. But you can't guarantee that your bishop, stake president, or family members can know how to do that."

I don't have to deal with anything.  And we aren't talking about issues that are necessarily mysterious or divine.   It's not like my Bishop is saying that we'll just have to wait until we die to find out what the 2nd level of the celestial kingdom is.    And besides, I'm not forcing anyone to come to the same conclusions as me, but I would like it if they would listen to my justifications for why I believe what I believe, rather than dismissing me as deceived.  I'm fine with them choosing not to investigate, but they shouldn't comment on my personal choices if they aren't willing to talk to me about my reasoning.    There are some of us that want a dialog, and have learned how to shift worldviews in order to talk to - and fully empathize with - TBMS, exmos, and the middle-grounders.

mormon,3bnmwf,Eazu,6,Tue Jun 30 21:26:48 2015 UTC,In particular - local leaders are often obligated to give the official accepted answers rather than engaging in dialog.

mormon,3bnmwf,elviiis,8,Tue Jun 30 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on the question, and the person.  I once had a friend who asked my bishop about being an organ donor. The bishop started to reply, but then said that he didn't know the official position and would look it up in the handbook and get back to her.  I've also attended several leadership training sessions where there was a lot of focus on explaining only what you know and not engaging in speculation.  So it's perhaps more of an implied obligation rather than a definite one."

Here is an example of what I'm bugged about and what led to this post.  (I'm an active member who doesn't believe much anymore)  1: TBM makes comment about evidence, faith, doubt, doubters, or whatever.  2: I engage in the conversation.  3: TBM draws conclusions based on the authority of the Church  4: I explain my doubts about the authority of the Church  5: I am labeled by the TBM as an apostate who has been deceived by Satan.  Regardless of who I talk to, they expect me to continue on having faith and believing, and they are disappointed in me when I don't.  But they won't engage in meaningful conversation about my reasons.   And they won't attempt to answer my questions or concerns.  Instead, they revert back to the classic pattern:  Pray and obey.  If they have had a spiritual witness of the truth that is enough for them to rely on, then why avoid any topics I bring up?   Why are dissenting opinions and allegations so dangerous that believers are taught to avoid them?"

Most exMormons I interact with are perfectly capable of discussing Mormons ideas from a Mormon perspective.   Iamstuckathope definitely fits that bill.  Are you you recalling specific interactions you have had with him?  Or are just you making some assumptions about how he thinks and approaches conversations based on a lack of evidence?
mormon,3bnmwf,HighPriestofShiloh,2,Tue Jun 30 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"It seems to me - based on his first post - that Iamstuckathope was asking questions to his bishop, stake president, and family members and was dissatisfied with the given answers.   It seems that he was only willing to accept answers to his questions that fit within his own worldview.   I don't know Iamstuckathope enough to have an opinion on his ability to discuss things within a mormon worldview. But in this instance that appears to be the problem.  It's probable that I misunderstood the situation. If that's the case then my comment isn't very helpful."

It is my experience that when Mormons engage in conversation with exMormons there is little or no attempt to understand the indvidual exMormon perspective.     I already understand the Mormon perspective.  I understand why people believe.   However even with this understanding when engaging with an individual I like to deepen my understanding of why that individual believes as it varies quite a bit from member to member.    In all the conversations I have had over the years if asked I could a give a detailed accounting of the beliefs of hundreds of Mormons.  What they believe.  What events in their life were influential to their beliefs.... etc... etc..  Why do I know this?  Because I ask.  I ask a lot of detailed questions. I want to understand as much as one can through conversation.    In fact, it has been my experience that many Mormons haven't thought about their core epistemology or methodologies.  One of the goals I have when conversing with a Mormon is to help them arrive at their own bedrock of belief (even if that foundation is different than mine and reaches a different conclusion than mine).    Now. How many Mormons in the last 7 years (friends, family, church leaders etc...) have made an attempt to understand my core beliefs.  What I believe, why, what is the methodology I utilize to reach the conclusions, what are my values, etc... etc...   I have attempted to have this conversations with hundreds of Mormons (usually after they initiated the conversation) but (and this is entirely subjective) I have only ever known ONE Mormon that has attempted to understand the core of my beliefs.  My aunt.  Why did she take this inititiative whereas nobody in my immediate or extended family has?  Nobody from my ward?  My mission?  I have made it very clear that I am an open book on this topic.  These conversations have been started by me and by others,  but they never go anywhere.    Why then did my aunt?   Because she was taking a class that asked her to do just that.  Find someone that has beliefs that contradict yours and try to understand them.  This was a college course she was taking.  Her first thought was me and she knew I would be receptive.   But without this class she never would have taken the initiative.    I am not trying to argue that there are no Mormons that desire understanding the beliefs of someone that contradicts their own, but I am saying that this characteristic (based on my subjective experience) is extremely common outside of Mormonism and extremely rare inside of Mormonism.     So how do these conversations with Mormons usually go there isn't a professor explaining to them how to do it?   They try to tell you why you don't believe.  When my sister was confronted with my atheism her knee jerk response was to probe into my sex life.   My parents tried to call me to repentance.   Church leaders asked me to pray.   Whenever my differing belief was a topic of discussion with a Mormon that conversation would quickly steer away from me explaining my position to them explaining me my position and offering a solution.  Books were constantly recommended to me by people that assumed I had a problem with the history of the church.  Conference talks were sent to me.  Testimonies were bared.     Initially these conversations were very frustrating but I have since learned to just accept that this is normal Mormon behavior.  Mormons propensity to understand a worldview that contradicts their own is very low.  I don't think this is a Mormon unique trait I just think that it is something that especially apples to Mormons.     Reddit is a great place because the rare Mormon that does desire this type of conversation occasionally does pop up.  But I have never experienced in the real world from a Mormon.  I have with many Christians (usually the more liberal ones), many atheists, agnostics, sikhs (yes even them, the few that I have met were very interested in deep conversations), jews (especially jews) etc... etc...   Mormons?  Not so much.   And its to bad because a huge chunk of the people that interact with ever day ever week are Mormon.  I work with Mormons (live in Salt Lake) nearly all of my extended family is Mormon, all of my immediate family is Mormon etc...    But none of them are interested in introspective deep conversation.   I luckily have found enough people to satisfy this itch in my real life and internet life but the desire persists that MAYBE just maybe a parent, a cousin, a former mission companion, highschool friend, will show some desire to understand.  But won't hold my breath.   My attempts with my friends and family have always reminded me of their deep deep desire that I return to the religion.  I do not desire that they leave (at least not in the same way)."
mormon,3bnmwf,kolorado,4,Wed Jul 1 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this.   When I was 12, I asked my two best friends if they ever wondered if the church wasn't true - and both of them immediately said ""NO!"" And that was as far as that discussion ever got.   It's true that most mormons are so certain of their worldview that they dismiss anything contrary as soon as they see it - and certainly the insistence the church holds the absolute truth aggravates that. I don't think there's anything wrong or bad about that - it's just the reality of the situation.  I would speculate that if you lived in a large jewish neighborhood - or catholic, or sikh, or atheist for that matter - you would probably experience a similar lack of deep conversations on belief. I think such thoughts are rare and are often associated with being an outsider to a community. But I really only have anecdotal experiences to back that up.   But I think your comment gets at one of the fundamental challenge of mormon/middle-grounder/exmormon relations - that most mormons approach doubters with the goal of saying the one right sentence that will bring them back to church, while most doubters simply want to be understood and respected."

No.  The difference being that the LDS church teaches its members to actively avoid contrary information.   This is not true in the religions (and atheists) you mentioned.  Its not unique to the LDS church but all the churches you hit on its definitely not a part of their culture.   Jews are especially interested in academic inquiry into all things temporal.   This is a direct result of their culture and why they are disproportionally represented in the upper echelons of academic achievement.     that most mormons approach doubters with the goal of saying the one right sentence that will bring them back to church, while most doubters simply want to be understood and respected.   Bingo.  Mormons believe in a magical form of communication and they are God's gift to the human race.   They believe if they say the right things with the right conviction then God will magically move the neurons in the other persons brain to see the validity of their beliefs even if they aren't arguing for them.  They just need to declare them with conviction.   It really shuts down the conversation.   Mormons view the silent response they often get when they randomly invoke their testimony during conversation as the spirit.  What is really happening is the listener is being caught off guard at the awkwardness of the Mormons and would prefer not to address their asinine comment head on."

(unless you meant to try and express something else other than what was stated)  It doesn't matter what the best answer is for you if it's based on fallacies and lies. Which I would imagine is also one of the major arguing points of people who get into a discussion with Mormons about religion.   Anyways the thing I was attempting to say is simply that this is an observation that holds true for nearly any group of people in any argument about any subject.   Even as an extremely open minded person, there will always be a bias towards the comfortable and familiar, and that will be easily confused for ""the best answer"" or ""correct"" or ""truth""."

Yes, this is a big part it's all so frustrating.  It feels like they should be interested in exploring these issues with you to help you arrive at the truth.  I think it boils down to the idea that each member knows that their testimony is tied strongly to the maintenance they give it (i.e., reading, praying, listening to faith-promoting stories, etc.).  To explore the issues with you is to deliberately open themselves up to evidences and ways of thinking that have demonstrably destroyed a person's testimony.  Have you ever seen people play the game where they take a bunch of gospel ideas and then keep eliminating them until they end up with only one?  Inevitably, a ""personal testimony"" is always one of the last ones left.  And what you've taken kills testimonies...  I don't know what the answer is except maybe just accepting it."

On the other hand, I suppose that they could interpret plural marriage as each marriage is a separate and distinct entity.  A man with two wives has two separate and distinct families.  The women have no marital relationship with one another, and thus each marriage consists of one man, and one woman."

(https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3bom61/upward_thought_timeline_of_lds_ordinance_changes/)  It sounds like ""legal and lawful"" was added in 1939. At that point, it sounds like it was a pretty positive change then.   1939, Mar 13: ""As you are aware, a few years ago the Temple Covenant of chastity was modified so as to permit faithful, worthy women of the Church whose husbands have not received the Endowment to go to the Temple for their own endowments and not be violating their covenant by living with their husbands thereafter, to whom they have not been given of the Lord in the authority of the Holy Priesthood. Young unmarried women are also affected by the foregoing named action, so, if they marry outside the Temple after receiving their endowment they will not be violating their covenants."" (George F. Richards letter to Heber J. Grant)   I'd bet that the definition of the law of chastity will change again. Perhaps instead of ""legal and lawful"" it will be marriages recognized by the church. Since polygamy's no longer a legal battle, I don't think that excluding ""legal and lawful"" would be much of a problem. Or maybe they could just be more explicit about ""legal and lawful marriage between one man and one woman""."

This means that they'll have trouble if they deny them access to married persons accommodation or other rights. However, that part of the honor code, as quoted, will (should) still protect them against ""the gays"".    Alcohol is legal, yet the honor code explicitly ""outlaws"" it.    I believe the only issue will be if someone attacks the honor code as a gender discriminatory policy as they did with the marriage issue.
