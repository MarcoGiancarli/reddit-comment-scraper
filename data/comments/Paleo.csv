Paleo,3e47vq,DDPYogurt,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:02 2015 UTC,I love coconut water!  But the picture of a coconut accompanying this thread made me think... is it more cost effective to buy coconuts and drain them than it is to buy coconut water?  I find cartons of the delicious juice can be rather pricey... is it cheaper to buy a bunch of coconuts and reap all the benefits?
Paleo,3e47vq,DDPYogurt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:06 2015 UTC,I don't know the whole process of how the coconut water is extracted out of the coconut maybe is not worth the trouble.

Paleo,3e2hkk,TheLegitBatMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:42 2015 UTC,I stopped reading at that point as well. Good article up until that statement. I see the value in what he writes against Whole Foods position on selling junk. That statement regarding sugar and diabetes is not exactly accurate.
Paleo,3e2hkk,Whats-gluten,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"Ok so a few points.   The author states that soda contributes to diabetes, however soda shouldn't be used to demonise sugar. There's phosphoric acid, preservatives and most soda uses HFCS not sucrose. Potassium has an important role in insulin control and preventing insulin resistance. Potassium is typically low or non existant in soda, but high in fruit There's the argument that diabetes is a disease that causes an inability to handle blood sugar, not caused by blood sugar. Junk food often contains vegetable oils, refined grains and insufficient vitamins/nutrients, yet all the blame is on sugar for causing diabetes.   This article is pretty much sensationalism bullshit."

Paleo,3e1uw1,WeldingHank,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Not ""paleo"", but it's fine. It has such a small amount of lactose left in it that that doesn't matter unless you're severely lactose intolerant, then you can buy whey protein isolated for a little more money what will be pure whey. And whey is just protein, it's an easily absorbable protein with a near perfect amino acid profile.  I guess I'm saying there's no logical reason to avoid whey protein, only the people who treat paleo like some kind of religion would be avoiding it.  Every protein manufacturer sells unflavored stuff that's literally just powdered whey protein, mix that up with some almond milk and it's pretty tasty. Or eat the artificially flavored+sweetened stuff if you want, doesn't really matter.  For creatine, it's present naturally in meat so I guess it's as paleo as any supplement can be. Just take 5g a day every day if you want, don't make it any more complicated than that. Timing doesn't matter, if you miss a day don't bother doubling the dose the next day, just take 5g a day sometime during the day as often as you can."

Also, you probably would want both and not either/or since they don't replace each other. You take whey to hit your protein goals easier and you use creatine for a power/lean muscle mass booster. Make sure you drink enough water if you start taking creatine."
Paleo,3e1uw1,Dodgesabre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:58 2015 UTC,Everyone I know in the fitness/crossfit community who keeps paleo makes an exception for whey protein.  It's easily tolerated with very little lactose and is a quick digesting source of protein that is perfect for post-workout recovery.

Pigs eat basically anything that you put in front of them. A study on European wild boars showed that they ate a combination of grain (from agricultural fields), grass, leaves, earthworms and grubs, roots and tubers, and hunted or scavenged meat from birds and small animals. Farmers have been feeding pigs on dairy products for hundreds of years.  I used to collect damaged produce and poultry past its sell-by date from local stores for our mulefoot hogs. What a dozen hogs can do to a whole chicken in sixty seconds is... alarming. It made for some damn tasty pork, though. I can't even eat the grocery store shit any more."
Paleo,3duqvk,paleogirl,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"For me, the first things I care about is the invitation for visitors to come to the farm and the ""pasture-raised"" label--meaning the animals live mostly outside and not in cages. I think those two things are major clues about the quality of life the animals have. I like farms that welcome visitors because even if I can't stop by myself (I've visited several in the Hudson area of NY), I can usually find a person or two online who has toured the place and written about it, taken a few photos, etc.   Usually if you've got truly pasture-raised animals you'll have most of the other things you want too--no growth hormones or prophylactic antibiotic use, grass fed, etc.   In some locations you're going to have a hard time finding 100% grassfed local beef because the winters are harsh and some grain supplementation happens in winter. I don't personally hate this. I do NOT want beef from a cow that was grain-finished on a feedlot, however. You should ask where the beef is finished and on what.   Some people care that pigs, turkeys, chickens, etc, eat a soy-free diet (it's fine if they eat grains--they can't live on grass). I think the grains, peanut-based supplement and skim milk must be the pig diet? They definitely should get a varied diet and the ability to forage around outdoors.   Words that I think are mostly meaningless include: natural, cage-free, humanely-raised, and organic (organic beef can still be 70% organic grain raised under pretty lousy conditions--and it's expensive as hell for what you get)."

Dairy is a common food for both chickens and pigs; it used to be common for pigs to be raised on dairy farms to eat the leftovers, and whey-fed pork is delicious. I prefer taking a day to actually go visit the farm (the farmer should have no issue with this) so I can walk around and see how the animals are living. If they're penned in, apathetic, dirty, or smelly (farms definitely smell like farms, but shouldn't smell bad), there's probably something off. If the animals are healthy, energetic, and actually outside, in a pasture, foraging for their food, you're probably good."

When I first started a health kick several years ago I cut sugar out completely and upped my intake of greens and fat, this is pretty typical of someone moving into a standard paleo diet.  I was pretty miserable for a while and tried the Auto Immune Protocol to no avail.  Eventually I found that going higher carb helped so I was eating lots of potato as it was paleo approved, I had mild success and ended up adding in probiotics and resistant starch which made things worse.  I was always cautious about dairy and fruits as I thought the FODMAPS would ruin me and I was also concerned about my skin breakouts, eventually I increased my fruit intake and it definitely helped.  I introduced dairy again slowly (started with ghee, then cheese now I can do cow's milk) and really upped my fruit intake, everything (mood, skin and digestive system) was finally improving.  Now days I eat mainly fruit and milk for carbs/protein. I also get in a few eggs each day, liver each week, shellfish and gelatin for the amino acid profile, most of these foods are very high in micro nutrients.  Fructose is better at replenishing liver glycogen than glucose alone, so when I cut sucrose and fructose from my diet I guess my body had trouble converting thryoxine into T3."

Bacteroides melaninogenicus spp intermedius had the greatest activity. The effects of culture supernatants of this organism and deoxycholate on intestinal calcium absorption and disaccharidase activity were studied using a rat closed loop model.

Combined culture supernatant and deoxycholate reduced calcium uptake by 39% (p less than 0.001) suggesting a potentiation of supernatant activity by deoxycholate. Culture supernatant and deoxycholate, both alone and combined, significantly reduced lactase, sucrase, and maltase activity.

The activity of lactase becomes reduced after breastfeeding, at that point the body no longer needs as much lactase. Not to mention a human mothers milk is much different from the milk of a cow.  The reduction of lactase activity after infancy is a genetically programmed event. Approximately 75 % of Earths population is lactose intolerant for a reason, because it’s perfectly natural.""

The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme called lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed.

Paleo,3dreuh,BoneWarrior,2,Tue Jul 21 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"but all humans are supposed to be able to digest lactose.   I'll just call up most of Asia and Africa and tell them they aren't humans then, I guess.   Lactose tolerance is actually less common than lactose intolerance. Something like a 25/75% split. (http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/03/over-75-of-earths-population-is-lactose-intolerant-for-a-reason-dairy-is-harmful/)   Just because one group of people can do something doesn't mean that it is universally true."
Paleo,3dql2f,DaileoPaleo,6,Sat Jul 18 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, I use almond meal in place of breadcrumbs in loads of recipes. It makes amazing, crunchy chicken nuggets so should work well for broccoli tots."
Paleo,3dql2f,LoafyPrincess,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:17:55 2015 UTC,Excellent!!! Thank you. I am going to try it and see how it goes.
Paleo,3dql2f,Glitterbritches,2,Sat Jul 18 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Almond meal=best meal.  I always mix in a blend of spices, flaxseed meal and Chia seeds too, because why not?"
Paleo,3dql2f,silentkaboom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:37 2015 UTC,Thank you!!!
Paleo,3dql2f,adventuresofacavemom,4,Tue Jul 21 21:05:29 2015 UTC,You could also throw pork rinds in a food processor.
Paleo,3dql2f,xxtheavengerxx,2,Sat Jul 18 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"I usually would use almond meal as well, but for a tater tot recipe, tapioca or arrowroot power should work as well. Brittany Angel has this recipehttp://brittanyangell.com/sweet-potato-tater-tots-glutengrainegg-free/ for sweet potato tater tots, using arrowroot powder, but I'm guessing that if you swapped the potatoes for broccoli, it would work."
Paleo,3do8gh,EpicRainbowSauce,9,Fri Jul 17 21:54:41 2015 UTC,There are well known links between paleo and lessening ⎯ or even alleviating ⎯ the symptoms of depression and anxiety. See Dr. Chris Kresser's full list of related research/articles: http://chriskresser.com/depression/
Paleo,3do8gh,eogreen,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:59 2015 UTC,That's very helpful thank you. =)  I was hoping for more personal accounts though.
Paleo,3do8gh,eogreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"Well, not everyone will want to share their mental history, I'd guess. :) Just thought the studies would be helpful."
Paleo,3do8gh,chasingbunnies,6,Fri Jul 17 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"I eat paleo primarily as treatment for my depression. Wheat, excessive carbs/sugar, and dairy are my biggest triggers, when I eat poorly I have a harder time stabilizing my mood, I'm irritable, and just notice a general feeling of sadness.  Paleo and exercise has been what's kept me stable for the past couple years, I really wish mental health professionals would push diet and exercise as solutions more heavily. They mention it, but no where near as strongly as they should."
Paleo,3do8gh,DaileoPaleo,3,Sat Jul 18 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely noticed a difference. Without a doubt. My overall mood is better and the little things don't seem to dig into me the way they used to. I have been reading a bit about gut health and its effects, and the more I read the more I see a reason to take the correlation seriously."
Paleo,3do8gh,jlcl119,2,Sat Jul 18 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"Paleo and heavy lifting has rid me of panic attacks. 2-years Paleo, 2-years PA free.  I've been getting anxious here and there lately, but I've also been cheating (food wise and skipping the gym) more than I usually do. Lots of out of town trips so far this season, and I like to eat at popular local dives.  I'm typically Paleo/Keto in the summer, but with the cheating I keep hovering on the edge of burning carbs and burning fat, so I'm off my game right now. I guess I should pick a side for the rest of the summer."
Paleo,3do8gh,AinsleySauce,2,Sat Jul 18 11:41:30 2015 UTC,The rebounding is a bit scary right?? I hate and love being so aware of that control.  I do paleo/keto and just allow for the cheese part and find it pretty easy to stick to. If you need any tips let me know =)
Paleo,3do8gh,jlcl119,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a dairy eater too :)  I have no trouble sticking to it when I want, we've just been out of town alot. I'm not leaving NYC without pizza and a cheesecake type thing."
Paleo,3do8gh,AinsleySauce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:34 2015 UTC,Haha I totally get that. I did reach a point of being able to just have one bite of those things and feel satisfied before ravenous demon struck my taste glands but I had left it by then.  Lately I carry around fat bombs when traveling.
Paleo,3do8gh,jlcl119,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:36:52 2015 UTC,Yep! Fat bombs and boiled eggs are car snacks. Must haves.
Paleo,3do8gh,drosenthal,4,Sun Jul 19 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"I used to do a cheat day once per week where I'd eat anything I wanted, including bread and other junk food.  The following day I had ZERO focus. I couldn't even read short articles, let alone try to read a book.  I haven't had a cheat day in 5 years :-D"
Paleo,3do8gh,ifonlybutadream,3,Sat Jul 18 21:53:12 2015 UTC,Haha right? Every time I cheat I lose myself memory wise and I think that is a huge link to ADHD and disconnect which both involve losing memory feelings.
Paleo,3do8gh,corbie,3,Sun Jul 19 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"I noticed HUGE differences going Paleo. My social anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and depression all disappeared. For the first time in my life, I actually had a desire to make friends and talk to people!  Exercise, even just walking a bit everyday I noticed also helped a lot.   Also, for my children, since going Paleo I noticed if they now have Anything that has gluten in it, they go Biserk and literally act like they're psychotic. Their bodies do NOT react well since cleaning all that out of system."
Paleo,3do8gh,Vulpes_Veritas,2,Sat Jul 18 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yes! Fuzzy brain, some mood swings, and all anxiety pretty much gone, which was amazing since a year of it my husband spent dying. I did save his life by firing three doctors and figuring out what was wrong all by my lonesome.  He does have dementia and is stuck in his old diet, which I am slowly changing to more paleo. And his memory is improving! Which they said would never happen, it would continue to get worse. His anxiety seems to be gone now too and he is quite cheerful now all the time instead of grumpy after a SAD meal.   The good thing is he hasn't noticed all the sugar is gone from the house. He can't drive, so he can't go get more! I just keep giving him nuts and fruit."
Paleo,3do8gh,icurafu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"That I so incredible. Food is so healing and then we went away from it. I'm both enraged. Your husband, as a human, had to suffer and glad you had the courage to change it."
