cassetteculture,3dtexl,sahboe,5,Sun Jul 19 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"A couple of months back a couple of friends and I bootlegged a music festival that took place in the fine city of Adelaide focused entirely on local music. We ran around like crazy from stage to stage getting every act captured live over six stages simultaneously - in the end we only missed two tracks due to technical problems.  Finally, now that all of the tracks are being mixed and mastered for distribution, we can move forward to recording things. The decision for cassettes was a recent one, so I'm doing a small pilot run for an act to give away at their EP launch next month.  Two of the tapes have broken so far (hopefully they were unique), but it's incredibly satisfying to see the stack of finished products get higher. Once the labels are in it'll be even better.

cassetteculture,3doez4,digitaldavis,9,Fri Jul 17 22:48:37 2015 UTC,"Vinyl is prohibitively expensive for many bands. With cassettes I can make 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 100, however many I want without it ever really becoming that expensive, especially if you do it yourself.  Also, many people are aiming for the shitty cassette sound wherever they can get it, so in some cases it's an artistic choice. Sometimes it's just a bad choice as I've received some awful sounding cassettes and just stick to listening to the digital copy.  What equipment did you use play your cassettes on? I will agree that some tapes are not very great, but I think they sound better than you give them credit for. For example, my cassette copy of ""Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds"" sounds better than my vinyl copy, which is plagued by all sorts of clicks and pops. The cassette has a bit of noise, but even with Dolby enabled the high frequencies still stand stand strong. I also have a bunch of old mixtapes from the mid to late 80s on type II cassettes that have held up extremely well. I wouldn't even say my deck is particularly high end either.  Part of my excuse in using them is that I like working on the decks. I get some enjoyment from trying to diagnose the issues they have and fix them."

cassetteculture,3doez4,88MilesPrower,7,Sat Jul 18 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"If you have a new tape on a good deck, you're going to get good sound quality. Not as good as vinyl, but but even on my hand-me-down walkman it's better than a standard mp3 (tape hiss aside, but vinyl also has it's own ambient sounds that can only be avoided with digital copies). As for wearing out far too quickly and becoming damaged too easily, I personally find that to be true about vinyl. Vinyl storage requires far more care than cassette storage, and damaged vinyl is often far less listenable than equally damaged cassettes. While a cassette can fade in certain parts and lose quality, vinyl will have all sorts of skips and pops that require constant attention to keep the record playing. My sister has even bought brand new vinyl releases that became damaged in transit and already had points on them where the needle got stuck and repeated bits. Cassettes are just so much more resilient. A huge chunk of my unfortunately small collection was donated to me by a family friend who had them lying around in a dusty garage for about two decades, and a lot of them sound fantastic. My dad has a pretty big vinyl collection that never leaves the house, but just because maybe the vinyl was sitting the wrong way for a bit and it was played a few times, it's all warped and full of skips and repeats.   As far as CDs go, they're no different than a digital copy. You burn it once and then you never touch it again, unless it has really really cool packaging. While vinyl is back and cassettes are slowly returning, I get the feeling CDs are on a downturn because there really isn't a perceived advantage in sound quality of a ripped CD or something bought over the internet and downloaded, at least to the general public. I could be talking out of my ass on this point because it's completely anecdotal, but I feel lie the current generation of kids feel like a CD collection is just dead weight when you have the same thing on your computer/phone/cloud/whatever. I only buy CDs if it's the cheapest way to get my hands on a copy of music personally.  Another advantage that cassettes have are their portability. While digital music is portable, digital and analog music serve different functions to the listener and collector, hence why vinyl has returned. Cassettes are, in a way, portable vinyl. Analog in your pocket. You can play them in your car and on a walkman. They are also writable and rewritable, which means that if Band A doesn't release a physical copy of their music aside from a CD, you can make your own analog version by burning it to a cassette. You'll see on this subreddit that a bit of an art form has arisen from cultivating a personal recording sound when recording preexisting music to mix tapes, some trying to give them a worn out feeling from the get go and that sort of thing. I don't have any personal experience with that because I want it to sound as clear as possible aside from the tape hiss, but it's become a hobby in and of itself for some of the people in this subreddit.  Cassettes are also dirt cheap, but if they take off again this advantage will probably go away much in the same way it did with vinyl when vinyl came back.   TL;DR: Cassette sound quality isn't nearly as bad as people think as long as you take care of them, which is easier and less important than taking care of vinyl. They're also portable and rewritable which is a leg up on vinyl, but analog and in many cases better sounding than digital (admittedly less as digital sound technology improves, but vinyl isn't safe from this either) giving them a leg up on CDs and digital releases.   I thought I was crazy before I found this subreddit, but cassettes are an awesome way to store music. They got a bit of a stigma once they stopped being made because now all anyone had was their tapes left out in their hot cars over the summer to melt which obviously sounded horrible, but now that people are moving back to digital music and vinyl is officially back (you can buy vinyl at Barnes and Nobles now. The bookstore), cassettes are reentering the world. Whether or not it's just a fad or if they're going to come back like vinyl did on a smaller scale I can't tell you, but I hope I've helped paint a picture as to how they got this far again."
cassetteculture,3doez4,joshuatx,5,Sat Jul 18 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"Why not?  edit: Actually thanks for posting this because I think a lot of cassette fans, particularly younger ones who find the format novel, often romanticize the tape a bit much. There was a reason things like DAT tape and minidiscs were a godsend to DIY and underground artists in the 90s. CD and digital audio was revolutionary, literally allowing a lot of music to be recorded and played back for the first time ever without compromise (especially dynamic music like classical).  I like both vintage prerecorded tapes (though less and less now, my collection got a bit too big) and new releases, especially DIY and underground music that's more experimental or avant-garde. Ambient, drone, metal, electronic, etc. sound nice on tape too, and just as appealing is the limited runs, unique artwork, and overall community between cassette labels, artists, and fans. I don't really get the appeal of needless cassette releases as much (i.e. a lot of CSD releases). Also, recording on tape is a lot of fun, and especially beyond the ""omgz lo-fi is so cool"" taping on boomboxes too, you can get a lot of varied and often high quality sound with nice decks and type II tape. I love cassettes because they are so variable."
cassetteculture,3doez4,marinebiologist10,4,Sat Jul 18 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"vinyl is still very expensive.   CD's should be a fine option, although not actually much cheaper to produce, if at all (if you're doing full packaging etc)  Lineage and tradition are also important. Where cassettes never left musics, there's nothing wrong with continuing that - and I don't think it should be accused of the nostalgia people like to. If something never went away how can you be nostalgic for it?  But also they don't sound that bad to me, but VHS is a great format for sound and I wish more people used it too :)"
cassetteculture,3doez4,Starsmustshoot,5,Sat Jul 18 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia plays a big part.  Some of the first music I bought was on Cassette.    They are easy to store as they don't take up much space.  The sound quality may be bad, but it has it's unique features, such as having a more scrapey or tinny sound than other mediums if played on a high quality system.  This gives distorted guitars a better sound than vinyl imo, and hiphop also could be argued to suit it very well.  If not played on a high quality system, some people then like it for it's lofi qualities etc.  Those are the main reasons for me"
cassetteculture,3doez4,PantsAreForPosers,5,Fri Jul 17 22:53:19 2015 UTC,My first two tapes purchased with my own money were Duran Duran's Seven and the Ragged Tiger and Weird Al in 3D. :)
cassetteculture,3doez4,tapesandtubes,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"Cost mostly. They're cheap, and that's a big plus for me. I collect vinyl, CDs, and tapes. I love music and I listen to it on whatever medium I can find it. I go through thrift stores and such obviously. Then some artist release exclusively digitally and on tape, which comes down to a cost thing for the artist."
cassetteculture,3doez4,theteuth,2,Sat Jul 18 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"You answered the question yourself...  ""Back in the '80s and '90s, we DIY musicians used tapes because it was absolutely the ONLY option. Pressing vinyl was crazy expensive, and the only way a DIYer could record an album at home was on a cassette 4-track or 8-track.""  Also, I really like the way cassettes sound - a lot of people do."
cassetteculture,3doez4,Geezheeztall,2,Sat Jul 18 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"Tapes are cheap. Vinyl is STILL way too expensive for most DIYers. CDs make sense for a lot of reasons, but a lot of people just don't like them. I prefer a tape to a CD because, in my experience at least, CDs get damaged faster. They just get all scratched up and then skip constantly and become essentially useless. Yes, tapes wear out over time but I just feel like CDs are more fragile in many ways."
cassetteculture,3doez4,40ozmccloud,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:27:45 2015 UTC,"We all pretty much hated the sound, though.  the cassette technology was never good - they sounded like crap, wore out far too quickly, got damaged too easily, and were just typically bad for music in all things except for the fact they they were the only option.   You might have hated the sound, I didn't. Mind you, I bought better equipment for much better sound.   Sure, commercial cassette albums typically lacked sound quality, but the cassette format was very capable of reproducing great audio.   Good source, good tape stock, and a competent deck gave great CD quality recordings.   My club mixes from the 90's still sound great, Normal, CrO2 or Metal tape. Mind you I did spend the money for great sound - 3 head/3 motor deck, Auto Tape tuning, HX Pro, used Dolby ""C"" (where applicable), and play trim.  I liked the format in the 80's and 90's, but what the format isn't is convenient. For best performance the format needed nursing. Heads needed demagnetizing every couple of hours. For best Dolby decoding and proper treble playback performance, play trim and azimuth had to be tuned for tapes recorded elsewhere. Reeling in access to a track was slow.   Today, I'll take a well crafted mp3 over a cassette. Obviously, the CD gave instant track access to an album, and audio formats give instant track access to entire collections, but my cassette collection isn't digitized - it becomes an experience. My cassette collection offers a snapshot of when collecting and archiving was done real time. I have dozens of mixtapes, and dozens of comedy tapes capturing stand-up from the early days of Comedy Central and A&E. Various FM recordings, VHS Hi-Fi concert audio to cassette, and copies of CDs, LPs, and cassettes borrowed from the library or friends.   It's fascinating to watch tapes play - It's so crude - scrub rusted tape against a magnetic pickup for sound. From an era when devices served one specific purpose in a large industrial box. It got the job done."

I really like this release because it was made the week of the Baltimore Riots exclusively, and in my opinion, it's really nicely made for such a small timeframe.  There's also a 30 minutes long movie/music video for it that you can view here.  You can check out his other music too if you'd like. This guy has been my favorite artist for over a year now, and I'm excited to see him finally start to gain an audience. His recent bandcamp is here and his older music is here. I honestly think some of his older stuff is his best, but I'm really enjoying the direction this guy is currently going in.  Thanks for checking it out!"

cassetteculture,3d56jq,garrett709,5,Mon Jul 13 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"I never made money on cassettes (which was part of the reason I got out). To keep costs down there are a few things you can do- print black-and-white J cards instead of color, buy cheaper quality tapes and cases, etc. These aren't my favorite options since they tend to undermine the quality of the end product.  Look at doing less tapes as well. A run of 25 tapes is slightly more expensive per-tape than 100, but the total cost is lower. If you find that demand outstrips supply, then consider doing higher runs.  Ultimately, if you want to break even (or make any money) I think you have to be a bit like an old-school A&R scout about it and get picky about what you release. Only release bands that have the capability to sell out your runs. If they have their own marketing capability that's even better. Also, look at how many tapes you're keeping to sell and how many are going to the band. If you are approached by a band that just wants tapes, but you don't have confidence in their marketability there are plenty of services out there that will just produce tapes."
cassetteculture,3d56jq,mothman607,7,Mon Jul 13 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"hey man, I run POST/POP (www.postpoprecords.com).  I dont think you'll ever see a tape label millionaire, but theres a few things I do to try to reduce costs/make profit...  1: find bands with an inbuilt fanbase - If you know they have a bit of a following already, or they always sell a bunch of their own merch and it seems to do well, then you can be a little more confident in selling their tapes. I guess its sort of obvious, but sometimes you can have blinkers on if its a band you love. You shouldnt put your label in jeopardy.  2: make sure the band promote the tape themselves too. It makes such a big difference. Ive had bands that dont promote the tape Ive released for them at all and its a sloooow burner. When a band (even a tiny one) makes an effort and posts on all their social networks and really sells it for you, you can do well.  3: Give buyers some options. If you are making 100 tapes for a release. Make 50 of them a different colour. sometimes fans want to buy both versions to complete their collections. These are the little things that can speed up purchases.  4: a good way to reduce costs is by doing a split tape. Like a split 7"", it means youre paying 50% and another label pays 50%. Theres also twice the number of people working to make it a success!  They are the ones i can think of right now, hope they've helped man!  jed"
cassetteculture,3d56jq,jedshepherd,3,Mon Jul 13 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"You're gonna lose money, bottom line. And keeping costs down won't matter if you don't offer a product that people want.    ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS: What kind of bands are you releasing? Do they have an audience? Are you filling a need of physical merchandise in your local scene? Who else is doing what you're doing? Your biggest asset is local bands and your local scene, find out who's gigging constantly, who's got fans outside of friends and family and most importantly do you see growth in their future. BOOTHS/CONVENTIONS/VENDOR TABLES/ETC: Get people on your side, ask the bands you've put out if you can set up a merch table at a show. Look out for local diy stuff, like zine fests, flea markets, college events, etc. Get your face out there, get people knowing who you are. IF YOU CAN'T SUCCEED LOCALLY IT'S GONNA BE A BITCH AND A HALF TO SUCCEED ELSEWHERE! BE COST EFFECTIVE: Calculate how much it costs to produce one tape. Factor in the price of labels, tapes, cases, j-cards, and printing expenses. For me, 100 tapes currently comes out to about 1.23-1.70 per tape. Some quick ways to cut down costs, rather than buy and print labels, get a rubber stamp with removable blocks and stamp every tape shell, or leave them blank. Instead of printing j-cards and buying norelco boxes, make o-cards and put the tapes in those, its a case and j-card in one. DIY OR DIE: You gotta do everything yourself. Buy a decent printer, tape duplicators/decks, learn photoshop and simple music mastering, it will help out. Investing in good gear helps out in the long run. The best purchase I ever made was a 1:3 Recordex tape duper with 4 tape slave expansion. I started offering duplication services and it has paid for itself. GET CREATIVE: Make people want to buy your tapes. Make the packaging interesting, include awesome goodies. A friend of mine put out a sludge/stoner metal band and every tape purchase included a pre-rolled cone/joint(sans pot obv). One of my releases came with trading cards of the band. Possibilities are endless, stick out!   Hopefully this helps."
cassetteculture,3d56jq,whatsthehaps_boozer,2,Tue Jul 14 11:48:39 2015 UTC,"Try smaller runs, preorders, and curate your sound as best you can. I lucked out by getting a lot of supplies like blank tapes and dubbing decks for cheap early on so I at least broke even. For my next release I'm going to actually use lower prices (I'm doing 5-6 now, not $7 + s/h as I did earlier, unless it's chrome and/or elaborate artwork and/or a long tape like a c60) and also promo harder by sending more tapes out and trading more frequently. Finding a niche in terms of genre, style, and aesthetic will help too. Also look into doing batches of multiple tapes if the releases work well together."

When CD came along, people quickly found the format posed a challenge, saturating traditional tape at high frequencies. While metal tape existed, tape manufacturers tailored metal formulations that maximized the frequency response capabilities of high end decks.   This was Sony's high end cassette. The tape path components were constructed to reduce friction and the shell designed rigid to assure precise movement of the tape from reel to reel. The shell was made of ceramic if I'm not mistaken - it's been many years since I've seen one.   If you had a Nakamichi Dragon, here's one of your reference tapes."

cassetteculture,3cbu0l,Renegadebreadbox,3,Mon Jul 6 23:11:12 2015 UTC,"I literally just got this in the mail, couple things I noticed right off the bat. -For one, the exterior looks sleek and metallic in the photo, but that is not the case, in reality it is made of a cheap plastic with a reflective sticker applied to the sides. Looks nice, but feels extremely flimsy. -Speaking of flimsy, the mechanism that opens the actual cassette deck looks like a button on the side in the photo, but is actually just a plastic grip, making you forcibly pry the deck open. Even the opening is uneven, it sort of bends at first, and I'm afraid to open it for fear of the deck snapping in half. Once open, cassettes are inserted upside down, and seem to fit alright. Audio playback is strictly decent, gets the job done for me, but nothing exceptional. -One reason I bought this in the first place was because the Q&A on Amazon claims there is a microphone jack for custom input, but this is not the case, it only comes with a built-in microphone and a headphone jack. -The buttons feel flimsy, not much to say about them other than that. The knobs that control volume and tuning are sensitive, but get the Job done, I suppose. -After testing out the built-in microphone, the quality is to be expected of crappy recorders. Somewhat poor quality, but would probably suit the needs of an amateur like myself to some extent, though fairly frustrating to try to record stuff without a better mic.  I'll probably be returning it, if I can be bothered to dig through the trash to find the original box it shipped in, though I got it on sale for considerably cheaper, so it's probably not worth it. My suggestion would be to avoid it and find something at a thrift store, though cassette players are a lot harder to find as time goes on."

cassetteculture,3c3udx,organdonor47,2,Sat Jul 4 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"did you pay by PayPal? I just search my mail for 'PayPal receipt' and find stuff that I've ordered that way.   The tape doesn't sound like it is particularly typical of their output, but could it be on this label? http://www.ormolycka.com - it's kind of renowned for lateness (although it seems like orders do eventually turn up) & the excuses sound similar!"
