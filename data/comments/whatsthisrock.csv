As you can see, the ""shell"" (It is really much more similar to a bug's exoskeleton) is only partially there; you have this little cutie while it was in the middle of molting.  While it is in its natural hiding spot on the ground a rock naturally builds a protective exoskeleton of ""weathered"" parts of its own body.  After a while, this exoskeleton gets too thick for the rock to be able to breathe easily, so it throws itself into a river or down a debris flow, causing the weathered sections to break off.  If you put this little guy back where you found it, the rest of its exoskeleton will be removed and the process of creating a new one will begin."

If it's a geode, just cracking it open is gonna destroy it, unless done by someone with experience. If it's not, not so worth it to get it cut. I'd say try breaking off the edge that sticks out.

If the mineral is harder than what you've found it will scratch it. If it is softer than what you've found it will leave a residue. This residue can be a totally different colour than the mineral. If it's brownish-yellow to yellow it could be goethite http://www.minerals.net/mineral/goethite.aspx If it's red to reddish brown it could be hematite http://www.minerals.net/mineral/hematite.aspx

whatsthisrock,3bnqnq,Vaquero_Pescador,2,Tue Jun 30 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"Tough little bundle. The first rock appears to be quartz, but god knows how it's become so weathered, and I have no idea how it's weathered so selectively. Maybe see if you can scratch it with a nail, if you can, then it's not quartz and we can reassess. The second rock appears to be a hydrothermal quartz stockworks within a coarse sandstone. The third rock also seems to be either a piece of vesicular basalt, or a piece of slag; the amount of weathering does sort of trend towards slag though. For the fourth rock I'd probably argue the same thing, it looks like highly vesicular slag. The fifth rock looks like a shale and I think the weathering pattern may be because the darker component was buried at the base of a river and the more rounded surface was weathered by water etc. Rock six is another puzzle, I mean it doesn't have the vesicles or lustre of slag so I'm at a loss. As with the first rock, I don't really know. For rock number 7 my best guess is a red sandstone, but not with anything near 100% confidence. And finally, the last rock does just look like slate."
whatsthisrock,3bnqnq,IAmFatAndHaveNoTeeth,2,Thu Jul 16 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate the response.  Those pieces we're both guessing are quartz with plenty of weathering are really abundant and I've had them sitting in a fish-less tank for a while now with no apparent effect in water quality that I can measure.  They aren't affected by sharp steel by the way. I'm just surprised I can't find any similar examples in all my research online. And your other thoughts have given me some good reading material.  Rock hounding is really interesting stuff. Thanks.  edit: Found this which helps explain the weathered quartz.    The quartz probably crystallized from hot, silica-rich fluids moving through fractures in pre-existing rock. The texture could come from other minerals that crystallized before or during the quartz crystallization but then dissolved later, leaving the voids."

whatsthisrock,3bnx4f,FreeDoum,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:19 2015 UTC,Coal?
whatsthisrock,3bnx4f,AnneeDroid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in quebec, right on the canadian shield, never heard of any coal in the area. That being said, I'll try to torch it to be sure haha  Edit: nope. It doesn't burn at all"
whatsthisrock,3bnx4f,SetFoxval,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"It definitely looks like coal, specifically anthracite. It's not that easy to set alight.  Your pieces look like they've been worn in a river or lake. They are probably not native to the area, but have come from an old coal-powered steam boat."
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,MeltyCat,16,Tue Jun 30 00:39:32 2015 UTC,Looks like some really pretty slag.
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,AnneeDroid,5,Tue Jun 30 01:10:40 2015 UTC,Maybe glass slag
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,KuatosFreedomBrigade,4,Tue Jun 30 00:53:58 2015 UTC,Where do people keep finding all of this glass slag?
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,furrowsmiter,2,Tue Jun 30 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"This was found on a walk near an old farm with large wheat fields in Nottinghamshire, UK."
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,Rowls,3,Tue Jun 30 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"Remember that you're in an area with a history of glassmaking that goes back to the Romans, and a smelting history much older than that, so even if it's just glass slag - really beautiful slag - it may still be something more interesting than 20th century industrial trash."
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,nvaus,2,Tue Jun 30 10:33:57 2015 UTC,"That would be pretty awesome. I just noticed it embedded in the path. I was shocked no one had picked it up before. The actual area used to have a psych hospital on it at one time according to locals and I've been finding all kinds of things on the paths. Pottery shards, old tableware shards, slate, light blue and green glass slap."
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,Ceasars_salad,-5,Tue Jun 30 13:18:47 2015 UTC,Labradorite
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,nvaus,4,Tue Jun 30 00:54:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but it really isn't."
whatsthisrock,3bkpqx,Ceasars_salad,2,Tue Jun 30 07:37:26 2015 UTC,Yeah should have looked closer.
whatsthisrock,3bm6gq,omgsoconfuddled,3,Tue Jun 30 10:00:17 2015 UTC,It looks like quartzite to me. Though I have seen marble that looks like that. Does it scratch glass? If it does its probably quartzite.
whatsthisrock,3bm6gq,StandAloneBluBerry,2,Tue Jun 30 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with quartzite.   If you wanted to rule out marble, drip a few drops of HCl (or vinegar) onto it and see if it fizzes"
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,Kngzdwtr,6,Mon Jun 29 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"This is natural. It's called Larvikite, a rock type often used for counter tops and fancy buildings."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,Sappert,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"It's also known as Blue Pearl in the commercial stone trade.  Very popular stone for countertops and monuments.  There is also a darker green variant called Emerald Pearl.  Quarried in Larvik, Norway, hence the name."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,winchisk,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:48:51 2015 UTC,"a finer tuned answer, as far as rock classification. Although, without Anorthite content measurements and no thin sections to go off of, can we say that the plagioclase in the rock is indeed Labradorite, being common in Larvikite? This is why I left it as Ca-plag. and the rock classification as Gabbro."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,kjcherfane,3,Mon Jun 29 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"It's not plagioclase, it's K-feldspar (80-95%)... Anorthite(4-30), Albite(58-82), Orthoclase(3-35). Feldspars of this type are sometimes called mesoperthites, or ternary feldspar. The composition causes instability in the crystallographic structure, the iridescence is caused by exsolution lamellae of orthoclase and anorthite.   Other minerals are augite (1-5%), olivine (0-5%), nephline (1-5%), hornblende (1-5%), biotite (1-5%), minor apatite (1%), Fe-Ti oxides (1-5%), accessory minerals of zircon, sphene, baddeleyite (ZrO2) and complex Nb-Th-REE minerals.

whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,Bbrhuft,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:48:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you and it looks like you are pulling your information from a source beyond your understanding. Under what circumstances are you using to claim any part of the rock, in the given picture, as K-feldspar? And at 80-95%? Sounds like you pulled up some information on Larvikite and paraphrased what you read about the deposits found in Norway. Sure the information sounds right but doesn't give a good description of the rock in the picture posted by OP. If anything, there is both Ca-rich plagioclases present as well as some other feldspar-group members."

My interest in geology began with collecting Larvikite and other interesting rocks from local stone masons as a child. I recognise Larvikite, it's familiar to me, the schiller is quite unique. There's two main varieties, a dark Larvikite and this lighter form. I prefer the darker form."

whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,kjcherfane,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:54:11 2015 UTC,"I've watched your comments on this sub and I respect your opinion.  But when I saw the pic, my first thought was plagioclase.  I guess I don't understand from your first comment why you don't think plagioclase is present."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,furrowsmiter,2,Tue Jun 30 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I know it's larvikite, which I also know doesn't contain much plagioclase as it's a variety of syenite (or even nepheline syenite, nepheline and quartz btw are mutually exclusive, and so is olivine).   If I didn't know about larvikite I would thought it might by plagiocase, there seems to be a hint of laminar twinning. But the texture is perthitic, where exsolution results in parallel Albite lamellae forming in K-feldspar. Here's a thin section view.  Here's a sample of larvikite very similar to the OP's."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,Bbrhuft,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:39:37 2015 UTC,Ok. Your TS sold me.
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,furrowsmiter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:41:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's the same wherever you guys are, but here in Australia we have Larvikite on the table tops in most McDonalds restaurants. There it just seems to just be some patterned polymer. So potentially fake."
whatsthisrock,3bk0tu,IAmFatAndHaveNoTeeth,0,Thu Jul 16 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"Looks real to me. I see a lot of pyroxene, Ca-plagioclase (darker grey) and some Na-plagioclase (lighter grey). Maybe trace amounts of amphiboles and biotite (black minerals). Mafic composition based on the mineralogy, looks mainly igneous intrusive rock, rather than one that has been heavily metamorphosed. You can tell this based on the crystal morphology throughout the rock. Coarse grained texture, most likely Gabbro. Countertop?"
whatsthisrock,3bkhjl,greenbeannoodle,7,Mon Jun 29 23:28:25 2015 UTC,I'd say that you're pretty much right that its mostly shells.  It also looks like there might be some chrinoid bits  Sparkly bits should be recrystallized calcite.
whatsthisrock,3bkhjl,heptolisk,2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks ahead of time for checking this out! I found this rock in my yard while digging; did not pay attention to it at first because I figured it was some kind of mortar or concrete on a rock from previous owners. Upon closer inspection, though, it looks a little more interesting, but I'm not sure what it can be, other than shells, maybe? Found in Tennessee. It's fairly heavy, very hard, won't break easily, and the gray side glitters in a few spots in the sun. Any insight provided would be surely appreciated. Thanks again!"
whatsthisrock,3bkhjl,aelendel,4,Mon Jun 29 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, definitely fossils in there, but they are really torn up so it'll be difficult to get any thing more for ID. Keep an eye out for something in better shape though!"
