Now, I pretty much exclusively drink Lagunitas IPA at home. When I go out and get a more ""casual"" beer with food or something, it's pretty much no different than drinking a soda to me.

alcohol,3dv47i,baconvader,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"Well chances are that your body, when it realizes it makes you really sick, suddenly goes, ""WHAT IS THIS POISON??"" the next time you drink it. My guess is your body is probably just remembering you getting sick, and not wanting to experience that again. As far as Bud Light goes... it's watered down urine anyways, so maybe you'd be better off with a better quality beer that is a little more comfortable to stomach. I'd say start slow getting back into it, and try some liquor and beer that are different from your regular choices, and see if something stands out that sits better with you!"
alcohol,3dv47i,Rain12913,4,Sun Jul 19 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"What you need is to recondition yourself.  This is a simple matter of conditioning.  When a particular food or drink is paired with stomach upset, it has a potent conditioning effect.  Whereas it typically requires numerous, repeated, pairing trials of two things together before strong conditioning occurs, we seem to have developed an evolutionary shortcut when it comes to foods that make us sick.  And for good reason, too: in the wild, we didn't have the luxury of getting sick from a particular berry three or four times before making the connection; it had to be instant.  So, given how strong this evolutionary response is, it'll be hard to recondition yourself to like - or at least not mind- the taste of booze again.  What you'll need to do is to pair alcohol (especially the ones that currently nauseate you) with pleasant things.  For example, you might try sipping a boozy cocktail with your favorite meal, or diluting a very small amount of hard liquor into your favorite non-alcoholic beverage and then working back up.  After a sufficient number of trials (a lot) your brain will ""unlearn"" the connection it has formed between [alcohol] and [vomiting].  It's all about context, as well.  You'll want these new experiences to be as positive and comforting as possible.  Try it when you're having a casual night at home with friends, not when you're hitting the town to pickup women.    Something to avoid: getting a little drunk and then saying ""fuck it"" before taking shots and getting sick again.  That wouldn't simply represent a setback, it would be like a reset button, and would likely even make this problem worse.  Take it slow,  your primary goal is to avoid additional bad experiences, while your secondary goal is to increase good experiences.  Good luck, and may Burrhus Frederic Skinner be with you!"

Obtain a clean plastic bucket or cooler, something to stir with, a large funnel, and several empty plastic water jugs with screw-on caps.  2.) Purchase a 2 liters of everclear (that’s a half gallon in freedom measurements) and a quart of Blue Curacuo (an artificially blue colored, orange-flavored liqueur used in some mixed-drinks)  3.) Purchase 4 cans of orange juice concentrate (enough to make a gallon), and  4 cans of unsweetened pineapple juice (enough to make a gallon) concentrate from your local supermarket.  4.) Assemble the ingredients on a clean tabletop. Make the concentrates in the cooler. Add the alcohol next. Then pour the blue curaco and watch it all turn antifreeze green.  slowly stir with the mixture  while chanting ""Green Gorilla Punch Really Fucks You Up"" — it needs to chant this phrase thirteen times while wearing an uncle Sam hat. Next fill the funnel with the sacred mixture and have a friend drink it (it's not peer pressure, it's just his turn) 5.) Using the funnel, carefully fill up a plastic jug or 2L bottle with the mix and put it in the freezer. This is the ice that does not dilute the sacred punch.  Gorilla punch is a strange and terrible brew. It looks like antifreeze, tastes like Kool-Aid, and has all sorts of disgusting floating things in it (the pulp) . . . it also has the peculiar tendency to make those imbibing it go totally batshit. The girls loved it — they were taking off their shirts, wrestling on the floor, and hanging upside-down from the railing over the stairwell. The guys acted like baboons on acid, doing backflips, swinging from the fan (it broke), and spitting fireballs with the little bit of leftover Everclear. In the morning, we found that someone had punched out the bathroom medicine cabinet and left their underwear inside, another idiot had puked in the closet, and the lawn was covered with beer cans and empty plastic cups. Everyone apparently had a good time, though (even if they couldn’t quite remember it), and no significant damage was done to the house we were using."

It's a beer that tastes just like rootbeer and I've heard it's great!  This is an American brand from the South, so if you're anywhere else you probably won't be able to find it.  If cheap is what you're going for, you'll absolutely get more bang for your buck if you get a bottle of vodka and mix it with your favorite fruit juice/clear soda.  Unfortunately if you don't like beer, you don't like beer.  It's not a bad thing, and generally if you start out with the fruity liquors, you can work your way up to a point where that ""alcohol"" taste doesn't bother you anymore.  Pretty much everyone hates that taste when they first start drinking.   I thought I hated beer for the LONGEST time, until I tried a Killian's Irish Red.  Turns out, I just hate cheap beer (and lagers in general) and pretty much anything with hops in it.  I delved into the world of ""malty"" beers and now I'm a huge beer lover.  Try some different things and see what your style is before you write off beer.    Try the vodka with fruit juice.  If you're worried about your friends giving you shit for drinking ""girly"" drinks (dude, fuck 'em, fruity shit is the bomb and the sugar gets you buzzed faster anyways), try getting a honey whiskey like Wild Turkey American Honey, Evan Williams Honey, or Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and mixing it with cherry cola.

alcohol,3dra0f,Hippocampicorn,0,Sat Jul 18 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, lemme tell you my first shot story:  So I'm 21 and I think I'm awesome cause I can drink now (fuck America and it's 21 year old drinking laws).  I'd only dabbled in alcohol by means of wine until then, because I'm lame.  I decide apple-tinis are the shit (because they were at that time) and I start to drink them.  Well after a short while I decide it's time for me to start shooting shit, cause damn it I'm legal now!  So I grab the only glass that is shot-sized, which happened to just be one large pipette that held about two shots worth of alcohol, filled it with vodka, and then put a DASH of apple-tini mix in it (up until then, my apple-tinis were at LEAST 75% apple-tini mix).    I scurry up to my room, close the door and lock it, run into my bathroom, and lock that door.  I stare into my mirror, shot glass in hand, and I try desperately to psych myself up into downing this shot.  ""Come on Hippocampicorn, you can do this, just relax your tongue and swallow, don't be a bitch.""  After about a minute and a half, I finally get this liquor in me.  And I promptly blow EVERY BIT OF IT OUT MY NOSE.  Cannot tell you how fucking painful that was.  I couldn't SMELL vodka or apple-tini for at least two years.  It took me until maybe 6 months ago to attempt shots again, and I'm 25 now.  The moral of the story is - shots are scary as fuck and suck when you're first starting out with alcohol."

alcohol,3dm5tf,f33f33nkou,3,Fri Jul 17 12:33:01 2015 UTC,"David Wondrich's magic formula should work:   75 ml liquor (Tequila, Gin, Whisky, Rum, etc) 25 ml Aperol 25 ml liqueur (fruit or berry works best) 25 ml Lemon juice (or lime if you think lemon juice won't get the right amount of tart/sourness)   Get yourself a bottle of Aperol and some lemons or limes, then go to town.  I like mixing with whisky (scotch, bourbon, rye, whatever - but if you have easy access to decent rye, use that) or navy-strength, juniper-forward gin.    The great thing about Wondrich's magic formula, though, is that it basically works with anything - Aperol is an amazing bridging agent. I've used his formula with a variety of liqueurs including crowberry, black currant (but at about 20% ABV), red currant, lemon, cherry, blueberry, strawberry, and undoubtedly more that I can't remember right now.

Add a packet of that (or two depending on how much jello you're making) and it'll make everything much more firm.  Just add the knox (slowly sprinkle it) into your water in the sauce pan BEFORE you start to heat it up.  Let it sit and soak up some of the water before you turn the heat on, and then make sure it's all dissolved by stirring it up before you add in the actual flavored jello mix.  If you want some absolutely incredible jello shot recipes, check out The Jelly Shot Test Kitchen.  This blog is amazing, has great pictures, and very clear directions for the culinary challenged like myself. ;)   /u/leakproofgrain's tip of adding in alcohol instead of cold water is a good one, that way you're not heating your alcohol (and therefore burning off all the stuff that gets you toasty) and you get that chilled liquid into your mix.

I make sure to melt all the jelly I'm going to be using first and allow the mixture to cool a little so it doesn't evaporate the alcohol. I then add half of the cold water needed, and then add the other half as vodka.  I don't always make my jello in shot glasses, so if you were going to do that I'd maybe swap more cold water for vodka. I normally make it in tupperware boxes because there's so much of it and it's a lot easier. Adding fruit is also great!"

I think I was 16 at the time I started getting pretty curious about drinking and couldn't really resist it especially when I knew exactly where everything was. My mom was always out at night so I just started experimenting over the course of a few days, started with easy stuff like mike's hard lemonade and only got a slight buzz. Wasn't enough to satisfy my curiosity so I decided to just go straight for the vodka she had, stupid yes but to me I just figured that was the strongest drink she had and would get me drunk.   I knew absolutely nothing about drinking it so after some quick Google searches I just mixed maybe a quarter of a glass or so with orange juice. Drank it (probably took me like 10-15 minutes alone just to finish a glass of that shit), tasted absolutely disgusting, started kicking in probably 30-45 minutes later I want to say, had a strong buzz. Refilled my glass and started drinking more, probably did this 3 or 4 times (varying amounts of vodka) over the course of 3 hours I want to say. Went from buzz to dizziness after an hour and a half-two hours, then the dizziness got worse, like a scary, just got off of a crazy roller coaster dizzy. then after about 2 1/2-3 hours my extremities started getting numb, my arms felt weightless, and had pins and needles, like if you sit down in an awkward position for a long  and stand up you get all tingly. even my lips were getting really numb and tingly. at this point though I was starting to panic and luckily ran to the toilet in time to barf and get it all out, and that was it, went to bed, woke up the next day pretty much the same as ever, no hangover or anything.  haven't really tried to drink since then, or at least not to the extent that i did, obviously I'll be much more cautious if/when I do"

Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.

However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.   In addition to this, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah).

Can be a type of anxiety disorder, depression, OCD, etc. Doctor can put you on some form of medication to help. The medication I am on is only $6/mo so it is way cheaper than alcohol. Just make sure you can stop drinking first because a lot of these medications you cannot drink alcohol with. Good luck!"

It's really bad and strange cause I know when most people drink it usually gives them less focus and more procrastination. Something is weird.  TheShadyTrader should be right about the medication part. I should have it checked out. Guess medication has lesser side effects than drinking lol.

alcohol,3cdigk,KoolDisaster,7,Tue Jul 7 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"Some of my friends have one go-to that they always stick with. I like to vary what I drink.  It's never been a problem, nobody really cares that I don't have one specific drink I have all the time. There's nothing wrong with having three or four 'go-to' drinks. Figure out what you like and what tastes good to you.    For me, it depends on what mood I'm in or how much I want to drink.  If I'm out with my buddies before going to see a movie, it's usually some Jameson and an Irish car bomb or two (or three...).  Group of friends for a night on the town- maybe a half dozen rum & cokes.  Dinner with family?  Maybe one glass of good scotch on the rocks.  Mexican restaurant?  Margarita, thank you very much.   Edit : how did I find the drinks I like to sip on? Trying all different kinds. I prefer a calm, partially filled, relaxed atmosphere over a overly loud, packed club. I chat with the bartenders, find out what's popular, what they like to drink, what they like to make. Sometimes they'll give you a little sample of something you've never tried."

I normally hit up whatever looks decent and is on sale at the liquor store. Variety is the spice of life though, so I couldn't see myself only drinking one type of drink, I just have a comfortable option that I know I will enjoy. Also, I don't see how someone only goes for Absolut. Mid range vodka is pretty much all the same."

If you can, check out local distilleries and do taste testing. Treat the booze like a date. Learn everything you can the taste, the body, the smell. Likely you'll find you like more than one for different purposes. That's fine. Maybe you'll find out you're monogamous with jager or rum. Maybe the sweet notes will get boring and you no longer want such a one-note flavour. Spiced rums are cheap, young, and get the job done. But maybe you start looking for something with a bit more experience and find yourself cheating with the older more sophisticated rums that teach your tongue new things.   Point is, experiment, and don't shy away from the middle to top shelf boozes from time to time.  Me, I'm not able to stay loyal to one kind of alcohol but when I go out to a bar or with friends I try to order whatever the house specializes in. Sort of a ""when in Rome"" attitude.

For liquor, look up some mixed drinks / cocktails that sound good, buy stuff to make it. For beer, do some research on what sounds interesting to you, buy it. You may end up with something you don't like, but that's part of the gamble of trying new things.  It's hard to recommend what someone else buy unless you know their tastes in food/drink, but I can give you some of my favorite drinks at least. Perfect storm (kraken, ginger beer, lime, maybe bitters), cherry Dr. Pepper (vodka, cherry juice, Dr. Pepper), Margarita (Cointreau, tequila, kosher salt, lime, ice), Tequila sunrise (tequila, orange juice, grenadine), caipirinha (lime, brown sugar, Cachaça).  As for beer, if you don't care for hops too much try sour beers, like a gose (highway 28 blood orange gose from Anderson brewing is pretty damn interesting). I also recently got some boulevard brewery tank #7, its the shit (if a bit pricy). I'm much less well versed in beer lol.  Cachaça and Cointreau tend to be on the expensive side for a fifth (~$30-40), and keep in mind you get what you pay for. Hope I helped at least a little bit. I hate ciders, so no help there though."

Again, about $20-30.  The Cointreau is mid-late 80's, still contemporary though, also $20 range.  The Astor Home White Label has a bit of notoriety, as it's no longer avaiable.

If you are looking for ABV per dollar, cheap vodka is usually the best, straight up, although you can water it down because water is basically free.

At the price point they won't taste the best straight, but if you mix it you won't tell the difference.   Then I'd say look into some gin, tequila, and whiskey. Find out what you like best and get a pricier ($25-30) bottle of that and keep that for treating yourself. I usually have a drink or two of nice stuff to start and then go to the cheap vodka and rum for the night.   As far as brands, svedka vodka is good and around $20, so is smirnoff.

I would say keep mixers light right now, you're still in college. If you're in the dorms, grab a couple cases of pop (coke and dr pepper mix well with rum, brisk and vodka is amazing). Something like orange juice or lemonade mixes great with vodka too. If you're in an apartment you may be able to do more.

One exception might be svedka, which is decent, but not great. If you want specific recommendations, I recommend going to the specific subreddit (/r/vodka /r/bourbon etc.). For the price of Smirnoff, you could get something like svedka or even Sobieski. For a few dollars more, you can grab Tito's! That being said, Smirnoff isn't the grossest thing ever, it just isn't that good. Definitely drinkable. Especially as a new drinker, it'll be hard to recognize the differences until you've tried a few different things.  Edit: some overmarketed alcohols that are overpriced include: Grey Goose, Patron, Bacardi, Jack Daniels, Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo. All of them have cheaper alternatives for the same (or better) quality.

Pro tip for the 151: Caribou Lou and Flaming Dr pepper are the best drinks to make with the stuff. Both are very palatable.  I wouldn't recommend shots because,  like /u/bru_tech pointed out, it's easy to overdo if you aren't well acquainted with the hard stuff."

alcohol,3bmixn,Hehlol,2,Tue Jun 30 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say the origin of this idea more came from the fact that beer will not make you feel drunk super fast, so you'll drink more of it and when you follow that with liquor you'll have consumed way more alcohol than if you drank a some liquor first, which you can typically feel the effects of pretty quickly and then followed up with a beer.

alcohol,3bj091,xkillac4,10,Mon Jun 29 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"Loaded question.  However, it's safe to assume that vodka has less.  The higher the alcohol, the less room for anything else (fat, carbs, protein).  If we're talking within a certain type of drink... such as wine or beer, this may not necessarily be the case.  This brings up an entirely separate debate though... of whether or not you are in agreement with the fact that alcohol calories are metabolized the same as other calories.  A gram of alcohol is equivalent to approximately 7 calories.  Carb 4, Protein 4, Fat 9.  I've read studies that concluded alcohol is poorly metabolized, so out of the 7, your body is really only using 2-3.  Anyway.. yeah.. it's hard to beat diet soda and high powered liquor."

alcohol,3bj091,WeLikeToHaveFunHere,3,Tue Jun 30 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"Assuming you take the equivalent alcohol and don't mix it with anything beer will have more calories because vodka only has alcohol calories and beer has calories from alcohol and carbs that are left over in the brewing prowess. Vodka is basically distilled beer so it gets rid of this.   However, this isn't the whole picture. I'm going to take to seconds to plug the ketogenic diet and /r/keto. Carbs raise blood sugar and in a response to this your body puts this sugar into fat. The same thing happens when you drink beer. This can lead to excess fat stores and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Alcohol on the other hand gets metabolized in the liver (which is why you can also get alcoholic fatty liver disease if you drink too much.) however it won't lead to abdominal fat stores like carbs will. So theoretically if you drank the same calories of beer and vodka you would be skinnier on vodka. Again assuming you mix it with soda or water. This is why it's called a beer belly and not an alcohol belly.   The other benefit of a ketogenic diet is that it lowers your tolerance. This might be seen as a negative to some people but I definitely save money since my tolerance is pretty high."
alcohol,3bj091,kaiser_xc,2,Mon Jun 29 23:21:24 2015 UTC,And the real kicker is that it usually tends to go that the tastier/stronger beers are the ones that really pack on the calories :(

So if it's not especially enjoyable, try it with some buddies next time you do, if you do.

They lit the liquor in the wine glass on fire for 15 seconds or so and poured it into the tumbler until the fire went out. Then they quickly moved the wine glass over the end of a straw so that the vapors from the burning booze were still caught in the wine glass.  Drink the liquor, then suck out the vapors from underneath the wine glass. It was all right, but I don't think there was anything actually in the vapor other steam and carbon dioxide."

For example if something sad happens and you drink it will make you think of that in a never ending cycle and you will be sad. Think of when people break up and they drink. It only makes it worse. But if you are in a mindset of being happy or having fun it will just intensify that feeling. I think it depends on the type of alcohol as well. Like if I drink beer its easier to stay fun and conscious longer, but if I'm drinking bourbon I will get drunk faster and be more calm.  Also yes I think it's normal to be a little ""depressed"" because alcohol releases endorphins in your brain or feel good chemicals and your body needs time to recover those. Drink lots of water!

You will definitely find some amazing premium offerings in those categories for $200.  It also depends on how you want to enjoy the spirit. Is it going to be a raucous night with friends where you plan on getting a little loose? Or do you want to sit back and reflect on your accomplishments in a more intimate setting?  I would lean towards bourbon, Scotch, or some other whiskey if you want something to enjoy in an intimate setting. The tequila would be my choice if I knew I wanted to party later or share the drink with friends (whiskeys are more of an acquired taste).  Also, I would be wary spending upwards of $200 on a super premium spirit if I didn't have the palate to appreciate it. I personally wouldn't go near a $200 bourbon or Scotch until I had tried plenty of other less expensive offerings and developed a palate for the spirit, same goes for an aged tequila.

If I were you I would spend $100 on liquor for your cabinet, that you can enjoy with close friends for the next few months, and $100 on a blowout party to celebrate you acceptance with all your friends and acquaintances.  For you personal cabinet, do a little research and ask around at your liquor store.   For the blowout party, get a few kegs.

alcohol,3atqlh,Cheezburger,2,Tue Jun 23 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""party?"" Is this jungle juice out of solo cups, or after-dinner martinis out of coupes?  Sugar (syrup), liquor, and a sour fruit juice is a combination that is pretty universal across all alcohols: A rum daiquiri, a whisky sour, a gin gimlet. Swap out juice for mint and you have yourself a whiskey mint julep.  The same can be said with vermouth: A gin martini or a bare-bones manhattan.  Similarly, ginger beer can make a rum dark & stormy or a gin mule.  The key is to have only a small number of bottles of base alcohols, and have mixers/syrups/sodas on hand as needed.    In all honesty, limiting options but still presenting choices will get you very far. Between gin, whisk(e)y, and rum, there's something for everybody. Don't go offering 7 drinks, offer 3 to choose from and people will be content with choice.  The 12 bottle bar is an excellent approach to building a cocktail collection, and a toned down version can be applied to a party."

There are online BAC calculators where you can input your height/ weight to see how many drinks over what amount of time will get you to a particular BAC. But usually it is about one standard drink an hour and no more than 3 on any one occasion.  So in that respect you sound ok during the week, it's the binging that's a problem. If you must continue to binge I would pay close attention to how each successive drink affects you and determine how many you can have before you start acting unpleasant, then limit yourself to that amount in the future. Usually the ""sloppy drunk"" phase starts around BAC .15, but ymmv."

That is like saying just because I am talking about celebrating a holiday, and a holiday with a tree, ornaments, gift exchanges, that takes place in late december but don't call it christmas that it means that i am not specifying a particular holiday.

If it was legal then you could take a bottle that broke and filter it into the same brand bottle risking the chance of glass shards getting in the booze. Or you could take the bottle that has fruit flies in it and strain it out and have some bug residue in there. Not just that but the transferring process could contaminate it. How clean is that cheese cloth / funnel / your hands? Keep it in the bottle the way the factory intended it.  If someone opened an extra bottle just put the cap back on it and keep it till you kill the other bottle.

alcohol,3amhwy,reallynotnick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"Because most people in a bar doing tequila shots don't like tequila Because they saw it in a movie Sure, but why and no guarantees it'll taste good.   Upshot, bar culture and shooters have a history. Most of that history is dedicated to getting people who don't like the taste of alcohol drunk in a way that makes them feel like they've achieved something noteworthy.  I think fireball shots have replaced the tequila shooters. Me, I like my tequila shots as a brave bull:   2 oz of tequila (Silver/Blanco is especially good) 1 oz of Kahlua floated on top   It's a perfect shot, goes in to the mouth perfectly and actually balances the harsh with sweet beautifully."
alcohol,3amhwy,drunkguru,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:10:20 2015 UTC,"Tequila in general goes well with citrus-like flavors so lime is perfect for this. The salt is to lessen the effect on your taste buds. It's a great and effective technique to get you into drinking tequila also if you want to mask the flavor without having to take a large gulp of something after.  I wouldn't advise doing it with rum. Rum goes well with coke and doesn't really go well with citrus flavors. Like rum and orange juice just sounds like a bad idea, even though I've never tasted it."
alcohol,3amhwy,cosmologicalanomaly,4,Sun Jun 21 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"In what world does rum not go well with citrus? Daiquiris, mojitos, rum punches, tiki drinks - pretty much all popular rum drinks contain a lot of citrus."
alcohol,3amhwy,julavi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:19:26 2015 UTC,Good point there are rums well suited for that. For me rum is just sweet as is adding more sweet citrus flavors makes me nauseous after too many.

alcohol,3amhwy,theodore_boozevelt,2,Mon Jun 22 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"r/tequila is your friend :)  Edit: I'll throw in a little primer.  The one hard and fast rule for getting a good tequila is buy something that says ""100% agave"". Anything that doesn't say that is likely going to be 49% neutral grain spirits and artificial coloring/flavoring, such as José Cuervo. Anything that says ""Gold"" is going to be one of these ""mixtos"".  There are four agings for tequila:   Blanco (aged 0-3 months)  Reposado (aged 3-12 months)  Anejo (aged 1-3 years)  Extra Anejo (aged 3+ years)  These are going to be progressively darker, more complex, smoother, (and more expensive!). However, none of these things are superior to others and many tequila aficionados prefer younger tequilas as they feel that excessive aging causes the spirit to lose it's distinctive flavor.   Tequilas also come from either the highlands or lowlands: highlands tend to be a little sweeter and citrusy while lowlands are spicier.  Any agave-based liquor that's not from the Blue Weber agave is legally a mezcal, and is going to be a crazy rathole of deliciousness and variety :)  A few suggestions to start out with would be Cazadores, El Ultimo, Herradura, Cabbo Wabbo and Don Julio. I'd stay away from Patron as it's quite expensive for it's quality. Not bad, just kinda overpriced.  Mezcal/Tequila is a whole world of spirits that rivals whisky in it's variety! Don't let some bad experiences with Sauza and José turn you off from such a unique spirit.  Hope this helps out!"

The party is inside the partier, but it can definitely catalyze an otherwise non-partier, whatever that means for you. Also note that there are different kinds of drunk. Personally I prefer drinking beer because it's easiest to drink quickly and doesn't burn at all; I also feel that beer-drunk is noticeably sloppier than whiskey-drunk, e.g. belching after beer as opposed to a hiccup after a shot.   Whatever floats your boat will keep you sailing. :)"

As a new drinker, I experienced tolerance appearing very gradually, my limit increased a little every month.   When I returned from about 4 months of not drinking, however, tolerance returned very fast, to the point where I felt a difference on a weekly basis. I was back to speed in about 4 weeks."

Throw it in two cups of boiling water, and add about a tablespoon of Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and a tablespoon of Tom Yum soup paste (both of these are available at Asian grocery stores; $5-6 for the tub of Gochujang which will last you forever, and $3-4 for a jar of Tom Yum soup paste). Boil that for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and add a dash of fish sauce (maybe a teaspoon?), a few drops of sesame oil (maybe 1/4 teaspoon?). Then add a tablespoon of peanut butter and stir until its disintegrated. Finally, add maybe 1/3 of the original ramen seasoning packet.

Alcohol does the same thing to your body no matter why you drink it. I drink almost exclusively for the taste, but for the first three months after picking up the hobby, I drank like three cocktails per day, roughly 5 units or so on average. I started to develop signs of an ulcer, so I had a month of ""prohibition,"" then came back to it at a level low enough that I've been told I don't drink (I do, but I sip and savor).  There's a difference, but the difference is that if I'd been drinking to get wasted, I'd have had a much harder time cutting back."

A drink is basically civilization in a cup.   So, yes, try it. The social aspect is likely one of the biggest things you're missing out on, but I'm also quite partial to the flavours of the drink.  I'm not sure where you should start. Beer, wine, booze? What grabs your fancy? You're old enough that there's no reason to start with the cheap crap that's consumed just to get you drunk.  Oh, and don't be an idiot. Alcohol can and will dangerously impair you when used to excess. Don't drive after a drink, especially if the alcohol is telling you that you're sober enough.   Also, just because you start doesn't mean you need to keep at it. If you ever feel it starting to impact your life or job, stop or get help to stop if you need it. Pretty much the same as you've probably figured for cannabis."

My family is full of alcoholics, too, but I know the difference between having a few drinks and getting wasted every night. Sounds like you do, too.  Try a beer sometime. It won't turn you into an alcoholic overnight."
alcohol,3a46rq,landmanpgh,2,Wed Jun 17 04:09:10 2015 UTC,"I'm with everyone else on this.  If you can use cannabis on a regular basis and not have a problem with it, then alcohol should probably go similarly with you.  It's less about being an addictive substance and more about people having addictive personalities, or finding comfort from their problems in alcohol.  Don't drunk emotionally, don't drink if you have an addictive personality, but it sounds like you're in good shape otherwise.  I came from a family plagued by alcoholism.  My dad was an absolute alcoholic until I was 7.  He recovered.  I was afraid to drink, but I tried it anyway.  I am fine.  I can drink a couple days in a week and not touch it for another 4-6 months.  I can drink to drunk every day and have no problems not drinking for a long time, even with a lot of beer/liquor on hand.  I have a healthy respect for it.  I know it's power and I don't let it have power over me.  I think this is the key to using alcohol responsibly.  As for being worth it?  See if you like it.  Just make sure you don't like it too much.  If you find yourself in that situation, just stop and don't touch it anymore--that's when you get into problems.  DISCLAIMER:  I am drunk.

That can be a good thing but it can also be a bad thing. Some people get angry, some get depressed. Me, Im the ""I love you man"" type of drunk. Annoying at times but is harmless and means well. I say if you have no desire to take a drink, don't. If you feel like having a beer or a glass of wine, then go for it.

With cannabis it's really not a big deal but with alcohol you can have real physical/deadly health problems.  I'm currently in a country where cannabis is incredibly unobtainable and the punishment is unthinkable.  When I lived in Colorado, I could kick alcohol within a week.

Having a glass of wine when you go out for dinner or a cold  beer after a day of hard work in the sun won't can't hurt. Just limit yourself to no more than a few drinks at any time, and you'll be fine.  My suggestions for drinks would be sweeter white wines, lagers, ales or ""lite"" beers, and tiki or liquor/soda drinks. The reason I'd initially stay away from things like IPAs, dry red wines or an Isley scotch is that they are acquired tastes and there isn't anything quite like them in terms of taste, so without a reference point you'd probably not enjoy them. It'd be like someone who's never had seafood before in their life trying oysters and sushi over a fish fry or a shrimp jambalaya for their first dish.

alcohol,3a4iiv,Silverton13,3,Wed Jun 17 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"Vodka may be odorless and tasteless, but it's also odorless and tasteless.  I don't recommend starting there, but instead focus in on what you like already.  Do you like coffee? How about chocolate, do you love the darker chocolate?  How about bitter foods like cabbages or strong foods like blue cheese?  What's your current favorite foods and beverages?  Generically, I've yet to find someone who couldn't down a fruity drink. Daiquiris or margaritas. It seems it's easier to find a decent margarita than a decent daiquiri, but the rum used in daiquiri is a more palatable liquor.   Mixed Drinks   Margarita Daiquiri Mai Tais Whatever frufru drink being heavily advertised at your Red Robin / Applebees / Chilis (seriously they make those to be as drinkable as possible)   Straight Liquors  Depending on your tastes. probably should avoid alcohol straight, or just shoot it until you can't feel the burn.    Rum (aged is often smoother, spiced is candy-like, and coconut can make you feel like you drank some suntan lotion) Flavoured Vodkas Fireball seems popular with people who don't like alcohol   Beer  Best way to get into beer is to work out in the sun until you're hot, sweaty and parched. Get someone to hand you a lighter beer that's ice cold. Little tastes better. In this situation it almost doesn't matter the quality, but please consider your local craft brew. Lighter beers would include Kölsches, Pilsner and of course the American adjunct beers like Budweiser and such.   Avoid IPAs unless you like bitter things a lot, but do make sure to smell someone else's hoppy IPA for a good idea of the joy of hops. Stouts and porters are dark, and if you like dark chocolate may be a good intro. Milk Stouts in particular seem to work well for this.  Wine  I'll be honest, I don't drink wine much anymore, but the easier kinds are usually the sweeter and inoffensive kind. Barefoot Winery is well distributed and makes a bunch of very drinkable wines. If you got a sweet tooth head for the Moscato/Gewürztraminer land. Otherwise a chardonnay or Riesling can be good. If you're interested in reds, Merlot is really easy to drink and is often very grape juice like."

alcohol,3a4iiv,tenbeersdeep,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"As with anything, it depends. I assume you're either drinking shit beer or nasty liquor, which is what everyone starts out with.  If you want to try beer, stick with light stuff for now. Miller Lite and Coors Light are your only friends here. Anything else will either be too bitter or too hoppy. The first couple might suck, but after awhile they won't taste so harsh and you might even enjoy them. You'll start to feel numb and they'll go down more smoothly.  If you're drinking liquor, stick with vodka for now. Why? Because it's flavorless, odorless, and mixes with almost anything. Spend $20 and get a bottle of Russian Standard, and mix shots with citrus drinks like orange, cranberry, and pineapple juice. They'll be sweet and you'll taste just a bit of the alcohol, but you should be able to handle them. If they're too strong, add more of your mixer.  If you start out drinking heavy beers or liquors like whiskey or tequila, you'll have a bad time. Hope this helps!!"

alcohol,3a3tw5,Dick_Beaterson,2,Wed Jun 17 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think this mixture will necessarily give you more of a hangover than anything else. It really depends on how much you drink, what you eat, what you weigh, and how much water you have.  For the record, the whole ""liquor before beer"" thing means absolutely nothing. It is a myth. The order of the alcohol does not matter. The amount matters."
alcohol,3a3tw5,lonelyliongrrl,2,Wed Jun 17 04:32:30 2015 UTC,"All things equal with how much you drink, eat, weigh and hydrate this sugary combo of sprite and coconut rum will make you more hung over than drinking an equivalent amount of straight liquor. It's because of the amount of sugar.  Also, the liquor before beer thing isn't fully a myth. While amount is the key to intoxication level, drinking beer before liquor can effect you differently if you are drinking to get drunk. When you drink beer first and then switch to liquor most people tend to get more drunk than they expect to because the beer is metabolized slower that the liquor. So people drinking to get drunk, making that switch will drink liquor to their limit and then have the beer already in their stomach metabolize into alcohol pushing them over their limit usually causing blackouts and or vomiting and often more severe hangover. So, the order in what you drink doesn't effect the hangover but drinking beer before liquor can definitely get you more drunk than you expect to get if you're not accustom to drinking that way."

alcohol,39jm4j,Helvetica2012,3,Fri Jun 12 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm okay  Vodka - I'd suggest either Russian Standard, or Svedka. Both are acceptable to shoot, mix, or serve to friends without looking like a poor college student.   Whiskey - There is a ton of variation with whisky, so you'll want to do a lot of experimenting. If you like wild turkey, I would suggest Bulliet Bourbon. It's reasonably priced, it's 110 proof (or 55% alcohol by volume), and it blends and shoots very well. If you'd like something a little sweeter or more mellow, I'd suggest Jameson or Tullamore dew, but I'm a big irish whiskey guy.  Rum - Depends on what you want to use it for. If you're a rum n' coke guy, stick with kraken. In fact, unless you're planning on making mojitos, ALWAYS go with kraken. Mojitos use bacardi regular.   Gin - Gin n' tonics are great this time of year, but unless you're a martini fanatic, I'd say stick with some low-shelf gordon's.   Tequila - Please stop paying too much money to drink patron. It's gross. For the same price you can get a bottle of don julio which is a far superior product. Of course, if blowing 50$ on something you don't drink isn't in the mix, I'd suggest you reach for the much more affordable espolon or Jose Cuevro Especial. Both are around the 25$ mark, and if anyone needs a margarita you're set."

alcohol,39jm4j,landmanpgh,2,Mon Jun 15 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've been enjoying bourbons lately, especially Knob Creek and Maker's Mark. I also just bought a bottle of Bulleit rye, which has been fun. It's got the same general flavor as whiskey, but it's got a spice to it that you might enjoy.  Since you like Kraken, you could try Captain Morgan Private Stock. It's a step above the regular stuff, doesn't cost a ton, and I love the flavor with coke. It's got a great vanilla taste, if you like that.  For vodka, I wouldn't spend all that much. I love Russian Standard. It's about $20 and is generally considered to be just as good, if not better, than most of the higher end vodkas.  Hope this helps!"

I would think that, for most things, if you can do it to vodka you can try it out on light rum. Tea might work very well since it won't add any sugar and overpower it.  Lime and mint would probably be a great combination in a rum as well, since that's practically a mojito. I would try a couple of flavors out on rum.  I don't think I'd do anything to a gin. It seems like it'd be too difficult to get the flavors to blend well since gin already has a lot going on. Whiskey would also be tough, but I imagine spice would be the way to go. Maybe cinnamon or vanilla."

It doesn't have to be a lot of alcohol, the most important thing would be that you can drink it without vomiting. Then, every day you have a drink, add a slight amount more of the booze (that is still palatable) and a slight amount less of the mixer.

alcohol,399hfp,alehbye,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - This is what I think about some boozes. These are just some of the boozes I drink regularly or have drank regularly in the past. Good luck and cheers!    IMO, you first need to decide why you're drinking.   If you're drinking to just get fucked up, buy cheap ""airplane"" bottles of different spirits - these can be found an nearly every liquor store, probably by the front counter. Find one you like, buy a bigger bottle, drink.  If you're drinking for the experience of sampling fine quality spirits, then I suggest visiting a nicer bar/restaurant. Talk to the bartenders and tell them you're new and want to experience quality spirits. This will be expensive, but in the long run, could save you from spending money on something recommended that you haven't tried before and not liking it, ex. JD Honey.  There are going to be a plethora of hipster alcohol snobs that are going to dig on you for trying/liking cheaper quality spirits, fuck those people. Drink what you like.  Take the time to learn the difference in spirits, especially those of the whiskey family. Note: Every bourbon is a whiskey, but not every whiskey is a bourbon.  Some of my favorites are (these are all my own opinion and palette of course, you have to experiment):    Whiskey  ◦Jack Daniels - 80 proof/40% ABV; sweet flavor, ok after taste, best over ice or as a shot; cheap  ◦George Dickel - 80-90 proof/40% - 45% ABV; not as sweet as JD, ok after taste, best over ice or as a shot; lower proofs are cheap  ◦Jameson - 80 proof/40% ABV; not sweet (to me), no aftertaste (for me), best as a shot, do not recommend mixing, mid-range Irish Whiskey, stick with it and it will pay off; mid-range price  ◦Crown Royal - 80 proof/40% ABV; sweet, great for mixing, as a shot or chilled (I don't like ice with CR); mid-range to fucking expensive    Vodka  ◦Absolut - 80-100 proof/40% - 50% ABV; tastes like rubbing alcohol smells (but many people say it's tasteless for them unless flavored), TONS of different flavors, great as a shot or mixed; mid-range price  ◦Grey Goose - 80 proof/40% ABV; rubbing alcohol still, BUT very nice chilled for sipping or as a shot, generally too expensive to use as a mixer (unless vodka martini - this is the tits); kinda expensive    Bourbon  I only drink one bourbon.  ◦Maker's Mark - 90 proof/45% ABV; semi-sweet, best sipped over ice, with a little water or a touch of citrus cola (think sprite), will kick your face in as a shot, shoot at own risk, imo bourbons should never be used as a mixer; mid-range    Tequila  Tequila is the devil. It's straight evil. But if you must drink it, you will regret going with cheap stuff.  ◦Patron - 80 proof/40% ABV; terrible taste; best as a shot with salt & lime; expensive    Rum  There are tons of rums, from coconut to spiced and everything in between. Rum is mostly seen as a mixer, i.e. rum & coke, but, I can't drink rum any more, but when I did...  ◦Captain Morgan Parrot Bay Coconut Rum - 48 proof/24% ABV; syrup-y sweet; very easy to drink (be careful), great as a chilled shot or mixed; cheap      I don't do Gin, I could never get a taste for it. Also, unfortunately, not a big fan of scotch, which sucks, because honestly that is some of the best shit you can ever drink."
alcohol,399hfp,Shimme,2,Wed Jun 10 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted on this, these are some easy to find liquors that you could find in most any place that sells liquor, but most of these are (In my opinion) way outdone by other liquors that are the same price or cheaper because, for most of those, the money is going into the product and not the advertising. I think OP could have a much more enjoyable time with other drinks that maybe aren't as well known, but are still readily available at most liquor stores, so I'll throw out a few suggestions.  Whiskey - Give Bulleit Rye (or Bourbon) a chance. Maybe Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon. Old Grandad is fantastic.  Vodka - I'm not big into vodka, but Tito's has been good to me, and the difference between it and higher priced vodkas such as grey goose in cocktails isn't significant enough to warrant the massive price difference. Vodka is probably the place where marketing is going to be the biggest determiner of price since it's fairly simple to make and doesn't need to be aged.  Tequila -    Tequila is the devil. It's straight evil. But if you must drink it, you will regret going with cheap stuff.   ಠ_ಠ  Let me guess. You had Cuervo once or twice and it was horrible. Then you had Patron and were unimpressed. This is not surprising, since Cuervo gold is 51% tequila, and 49% neutral grain spirits, caramel coloring, and flavoring. Patron is almost exactly what I meant with most of the price of some of these most easily recognizable spirits costing way more than comparable products, or being significantly worse than other products in the same price range. I tend to prefer reposado (aged 3-12 months in barrels) tequilas so I'll throw in Cabo Wabo, Herradura, or for something a little cheaper El Ultimo (both the reposado and the anejo kick ass for $20!). Really, going on a drunken bender on terrible tequilas is a terrible reason for writing off an entire type of liquor that's as diverse as whiskey. That's like downing an entire case of natty lite in one night and deciding that every beer is terrible except for the other beer you've tried, bud lite, which is only okay.  Hope this helps, I'm not trying to come off as snotty but there are tons of awesome liquors that just aren't as popular because the money goes into the product and not the marketing budget.  Also, give an American brandy a chance sometime, such as Paul Masson VSOP. Awesome bargain."

I'm completely okay that you may not agree with my entire post (or any of it)!  Good post.  The thing with tequila is, it was my first experience with liquor at a very young age. And , yea, I went through a lot of cuervo, but I also expanded out. Out of tequila, my favorite was cabo, with patron rose, and I would have listed those, but imo, both of those are pretty pricey for ""starter"" liquors.   I figured with what I provided (and now you and hopefully others) it would be a good jumping off point.  Cheers and please drink responsibly (or get trashed, I don't fuckin care.)"

This process purifies it and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly known as alcohol by volume, ABV).  As distilled beverages contain more alcohol they are considered ""harder"" – in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones, which are implicitly weaker.

Honestly, having a low alcohol tolerance isn't a bad thing unless you're at parties where you'll be expected to do a ton of tequila shots or something like that.  As long as you're drinking with people who respect your tolerance, and don't make fun of you for mixing half shot drinks or something like that, I would just go with it, and let it increase naturally."

My tolerance isn't so low that I have to mix shots, but too many of them will ruin my night. Beer is also a problem because of the sheer volume of liquid you have to consume to even get a buzz. Small amounts of Liquor and wine work best for me."

alcohol,397rqh,FredTheMascot,4,Wed Jun 10 04:21:19 2015 UTC,"I was at a party years ago, and watch some friends of mine make the best punch ever (IMO) with Everclear. Forgive me for not having all the specifics, but I'm sure you can fill in the spaces of my memory with your own substitions. First bought one of those (Igloo brand I think) coolers with the spout on the bottom for the letting the ice out and cleaned it out. Then I witnessed 2 entire bottles of Everclear poured into it, could've been more but I definitely remembered two being emptied into the cooler. Next came various fruits, primarily watermelon, lots of phuqin watermelon. Also some grapes, cantaloupe, and melons (honeydew maybe). Basically a ship load of fruit was added. And if my taste buds remember correctly Sprite/7-Up was added to create more liquid/brine (heh) for more liquid and they let it sit for a few hours and it was serve thru the spout with a touch of ice if preferred. The guys sipped the brew, while the girls devoured the fruit, and needless to say, the girls got wasted in record time. Fruit supposedly absorbed a lot of the alcohol, and the guys got done in after usually 3 cups. I ended being an impromptu DJ using someone's iTunes on their laptop connected to huge band speakers outside the house, with two random hot girls in my lap, while three others made out on a bed behind me. It wasn't until half an hour later one of my friends noticed I was missing. When he saw I was fine, I made him go investigate the situation on the bed. Everclear turned a get together in the best type of fiasco, and therefore it is the shiznit.  TL;DR: Friends of mine poured bottles of Everclear into cooler, added tons of fruits, some lemon-lime soda, and got everyone wasted. Hot bitches got involved, smiles all around. Everclear is the shit."

alcohol,38vcxm,thatguy1599,13,Sun Jun 7 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"I look at Buffalo Trace as the classic bourbon flavor. No frills, just straight-up good. In contrast:   GJ has the Tennessee charcoal-filtered flavor that JD is known for, but is smoother than JD Maker's Mark is a wheated bourbon, so the flavor is ""softer"" than Buffalo Trace or GJ, if you will. Similar quality though Jameson is Irish Whiskey, which is made primarily from malted barley (unlike bourbon, which is primarily corn). It tends to be mellower, though the standard Jameson blend isn't particularly fancy.   If you haven't tasted a classic low-rye bourbon like Buffalo Trace, it's certainly a good place to go next! It's 45% alcohol so I add a teeny bit of filtered water to it. Makes it a smidge smoother and brings out a tad more flavor."
alcohol,38vcxm,hrbuchanan,3,Sun Jun 7 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"Good to note that GJ is not a bourbon, but a Tennessee whiskey.  /r/bourbon has a guide to bourbon that takes you through different good bourbons at different mashbills. I highly recommend it"
alcohol,38vcxm,jwill602,2,Sun Jun 7 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"To expand on this for /u/thatguy1599, without going into crazy amounts of detail: Tennessee whiskey starts out like bourbon, but it is filtered through maple charcoal and aged in new charred oak barrels before it is bottled. It also must be made in Tennessee.  Take Jack Daniel's for instance. The grain bill falls directly in the traditional low-rye category of bourbon, like Buffalo Trace. But Jack is charcoal filtered before making its way to the barrel. When you buy Gentleman Jack, you're buying the same Jack that's been charcoal filtered one extra time before bottling. When you Jack Single Barrel, it's the same as GJ, but taken from one barrel that they say tastes particularly good (usually from a higher shelf, where it gets hotter, so more barrel flavor is imparted on the whiskey).  Basically, they're taking out certain flavors from the corn, adding a bit from the charcoal, and adding a lot from the barrel."
alcohol,38vcxm,hrbuchanan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Bourbon must also be aged in new charred oak barrels.  The location and the maple charcoal are really the only differences. This is laid out in how the laws are basically written as ""Tennessee whiskey is a straight bourbon whiskey that is made in Tennessee and follows the Lincoln County Process"". But there's also a grandfather clause for some brands of Tennessee whiskey that historically did not charcoal filter at all, and they don't have to."

alcohol,38vcxm,HeyBartender,2,Sun Jun 7 07:43:22 2015 UTC,I went to the liquor store today and all out of Buffalo Trace :( I picked up a bottle of Jefferson's and a bottle of Bulleit Frontier instead. I'm sipping on this Bulleit and loving it.
alcohol,38vcxm,hrbuchanan,2,Mon Jun 8 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"Very nice!  In case you haven't heard this explanation before, I'll drop a little knowledge: If you make a very simple bourbon spectrum, standard low-rye bourbons (like Buffalo Trace) would be in the middle. All bourbon is mostly corn, and in a traditional bourbon grain bill you'll have a small amount of rye to balance it out and a small amount of malted barley.  On one end of that spectrum are the wheated bourbons like Maker's Mark. Take out the rye and replace it with wheat! You lose the spicy rye flavor and gain a pleasant mellow flavor.  Bulleit Frontier Bourbon is on the opposite end of that spectrum: high-rye bourbon. It's not as intense as straight rye whiskey (which is usually 90% rye or more), since it's still over 50% corn. But you double the amount of rye in comparison to a low-rye recipe like Buffalo Trace, so the spicy characteristics shine through.  Enjoy that Bulleit! But consider making your next whiskey purchase a classic low-rye bourbon. That could be Buffalo Trace, Wild Turkey, something a bit pricier like Knob Creek, or something easy to find like Jim Beam Black or Jim Beam Bonded. But once you've tasted the entire spectrum, you can think back and say, ""Which did I like best? Maker's Mark, Bulleit, or the middle ground bourbon?"""
alcohol,38vcxm,hrbuchanan,2,Mon Jun 8 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"You obviously know a lot about whiskies/bourbons. Thank you so much for the info. After trying the Bulleit, I tried the Jefferson's small batch and thought it was more spicy. I'm new to the world of whiskies and bourbons so I'm probably not thinking about all the subtle flavors. I noticed however that the Jefferson's (spicier in my opinion than the Bulleit) had an oily after taste which was a bit unpleasant. I'm 22 so fairly new to appreciating all the subtle notes but I'm leaning towards the Bulleit. Any suggestions on whiskies/bourbons to purchase next?"
alcohol,38vcxm,BarryZZZ,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:06:55 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I'm 24 and started really getting into this stuff at 22. So I'm kinda like you, two years from now!  If I'm being honest, a lot of this is just from research. I sipped on Bulleit once and have had it in a couple cocktails, and I've never tasted Jefferson's. But according to dem world wide internets, Jefferson's is also a high-rye bourbon. Some say the extra rye covers up the fact that it's an 80 proof bourbon that's otherwise not super special. Bulleit, on the other hands, comes off in reviews as having enough rye spice and a bit more alcohol bite (90 proof), but still being generally balanced.  Again, if you're looking to expand your tasting horizons, try one of the low-rye bourbons I mentioned in my last comment. Then go from there! I'm still just scratching the surface myself, honestly. I've been drinking a lot more scotch than bourbon over the past couple years, and it's still daunting to me. But the more you drink, the more you figure out which direction you wanna go!"

It starts with the bottle. Don't store it in the fridge. Whisky can be stored at room temperature and you probably should. The reason is you want to get the full flavor. If it's too cold you will taste less.   Next is the glass. If you have one like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Glencairn_Whisky_Glass.jpg great. If you don't you can use any glass you like off course. But if I am at a place without the right glass a wine glass would be my next choice. A big part of the taste comes from the smell. So get a glass that can trap some air (smell). A shot glass would be the worst.   Most serious whisky drinkers don't add ice, again making it cold will reduce the flavor. Some people do add a bit of water (somewhere between some drops and a splash).  This opens the whisky up and releases more of the smell. This can also be used if you think it's too strong (like a cask strength whisky).   If this is your first bottle don't bother with the very expensive stuff. Just learn to enjoy it first."

I first had it at a castle in England (no joke!) and have been enamored with it ever since.   Mead can be drunk chilled, room temp, or hot. It depends on the mead and on the situation. Hot mead is really, really good on a cold day especially if its really high ABV (~15% or more). If you find mead labeled 'Viking's Blood' that will be really good heated up on a cold day.  Meads are relatively rare compared to wines and beers I've found, but some liquor stores do carry them."

Look for Redstone meadery's nectar of the hops,  which is hopped and carbonated, helping to cleanse the palate between sips, or Dansk Mjod Viking's Blod which uses hops and hibiscus to create a more complex mead.  Also, South African producer Makana makes some interesting wines, such as their estate grown coffee mead and bird's eye chili mead which are wholly unique.  Makana's meads are also shipped over in red wine barrels, imparting a fleeting yet brusque hint of deep earthiness.         Tl;dr  look for the ones that are more than just basic honey wine."

alcohol,38ra95,TheJarcker,4,Sat Jun 6 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"Have you experimented with any liquor or drinks before? Knowing what you like and don't like makes it easy to figure out what to order.  Assuming you're going in completely blind, start with the simple stuff:  Rum or whiskey and coke. You can ""call"" your choice of liquor (such as Captain or Jack) if you want something other than the bar's well (cheapest) stuff.  Gin and tonic. Gin tends to be a little off putting for newer drinkers given the often heavy notes of juniper and botanicals, but a good gin (aka not your well) and tonic is a very refreshing drink.  Vodka and juice. Screwdriver (vodka and OJ), greyhound (vodka and grapefruit), baybreeze (vodka, pineapple and cranberry) all great starter drinks and the juice masks the alcohol burn.  Or just tell your bartender it's your 21st and ask for some of their favorites or recommendations. Assuming they're not slammed, they'll help with opening up your palate. And once you've found something you like, try playing around with it. If you like Jack and cokes, try a Jack and 7up or a new whiskey, like CC or Crown.  PS: Keep a gatorade or pediasure around for the next day's hangover. Have fun!"

alcohol,38kyme,Scourch,12,Thu Jun 4 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"It's serivceable, decent cognac from one of the hugest producers; it's their lowest-tier product. It's about $25 to $30 at the store, but a bit overpriced for what it is because the brand has mainstream name recognition. I wouldn't buy it, but I'd certainly drink it if it were given to me. For both cocktails and drinking straight, about the cheapest true cognac that I think is worth buying is Remy Martin VSOP ($40-$45 give or take). Below that price point, most decent American brandies done in a cognac style are substantially better buys for the price (e.g., Paul Masson VSOP at $12-$15 is an amazing steal).  Brandy is probably my favorite liquor to sip straight. Give it a go, you'll probably like it and want to try others. Brandy also makes some lovely cocktails, such as a classic Sidecar. Though proportion preferences vary greatly, I like mine something like: Rub a piece of lemon around the outside of the cocktail glass rim, then roll that moistened rim in sugar to create a lightly sugared outer rim.  Combine 2 oz cognac, 1 oz Cointreau, 3/4 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice in a shaker. Shake with lots of ice until very cold. Strain into rimmed glass prepared earlier. You can tweak the proportions to your liking - the Cointreau is the primary source of sweetness and the lemon is the source of acidity."

alcohol,38kyme,emtilt,9,Thu Jun 4 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"Most people do not drink straight brandy of any sort (or, in general, better liquors of any kind) with ice, but you certainly can always do so if you prefer it! If I were drinking it, I would either drink it neat (i.e., straight without ice in a rocks glass [EDIT: I guess some people would prefer a snifter but it doesn't make a difference...looks like you have them so go for it]) and/or use it in a (well-made) cocktail.  The primary reason that people drink straight liquor on ice is to tone down unpalatable flavors in cheaper liquors. You never need to use ice if you like the liquor (and if you don't like the liquor - get something else!). Even fairly cheap brandies/cognacs tend to be well-made enough that sipping them is not unpleasant (something not always true of, say, whiskeys).  All of these things are just preference, though. Drink how you like to drink, although tasting things neat is often the easiest way to learn what you really like in a liquor, as the flavors aren't altered by other things. If you don't like things straight, try good cocktails."

alcohol,38kyme,lawstudent2,3,Fri Jun 5 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"Person above you was being a bit too nice :)  Although, everything they said was technically correct.  The truth is, this is not a good Cognac.  It's the stuff you use to mix cocktails with.  It's absolutely not the worst either.  My take has always been to start out with a good reference point.  If you want to start drinking Cognac or anything, you need to start with something of decent quality that you will use as a measurement against everything else.  Thus, you should go for Remy Martin VSOP or Pierre Ferrand Ambre.  Actually, skip the Remy and go for Pierre.  It's not expensive and it's amazing.  So if I were you, I would get the Pierre and do a side by side tasting with the Courvoisier.  As you realize you love Pierre more, make yourself a nice sidecar out of the other one.  If not, definitely taste it neat and then with ice.  But I still recommend my first option.  And welcome to the club."
alcohol,38kyme,languidity_,3,Fri Jun 5 04:58:35 2015 UTC,"let me add, Emtilt is completely right in that you should drink what you like and in good health. Absolutely, and cheers. However, if you are asking about etiquette, ice in brandy is a gigantic nono - cognac in particular. Go ahead and ice up a cheap brandy - but cognac is the equivalent of single malt scotch. It shouldn't really be used for mixing and shouldn't be iced. If you were to put ice in a vintage cognac, it would truly be a waste and rightly insulting to your host it had been offered. Vintage brandy, port, champagne and scotch are basically the top of the heap when it comes to stuff you simply don't mix.  That aside, cheers dotcomrade."
alcohol,38kyme,lawstudent2,6,Fri Jun 5 10:47:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck etiquette. I worked a Whisky Live event recently and one patron cruised around with a 1.25L bottle of cola in his bag and added a dash of it to everything he tried, from Laphroiag to Jim Beam and everything in between. I asked him what he was doing and he said he only drinks spirits with cola and so he wanted to find the best spirit (in his opinion) that went with it.   Most of the other people manning the stalls raised an eye (I mean it's a pretty curious thing) but we all talked about it afterwards and the consensus was that no one really gave a shit. In fact, the only people who seemed truly offended were other patrons. One of them said to me that I ""should tell him that it's unacceptable"". I said you can definitely give advice to someone about a particular spirit and its characteristics, the distillation process and how it's typically drunk, the mixed drinks it works in and so on, but there's no need to tell someone how they should put it in their mouth and certainly no need to judge someone based on how they end up consuming a product they've bought with their own money.   Besides, I much preferred honest cola man over the douches that weekend who said and did the shit they thought they should say/do. There's a definitive shift away from the old-world wank and pretense some booze snobs love to wallow in and I think it's great. Alcohol should be fun but some people get so hung up on using it as a liquid fashion accessory instead. It's awkward, tiresome and boring. Just drink it (cue Shia Lebaeouf remix).  Must say though, it was fucking hilarious to watch him saunter up to the Glenfarclas stall and ask for a nip of their 30 year old."

I'm 100% all for doing whatever the fuck you want with drinks. My friends are a bit more snobby than me, and will call me out on not making cocktails ""100% correctly"", according to ""what's proper"". I think it's all bullshit and improvise with whatever I want.  But, if I'm at someone's house and they offer me some fine Cognac, I do think it would be rude to pull out a coke bottle and mix it up.

I'm pickier about glasswear for cocktails than straight liquor, because cocktails are fussier affairs with garnishes and the like, as well needing to stay maximally cold. Plus it's fun to use a variety of old glasses (coupes, etc) because the antique ones can look cool. A snifter is a snifter, though.  I've gotten less picky about glasswear in general over the years. I used to try to use the right glass for everything. Then I realized that, beyond some basic types, it doesn't enhance enjoyment in proportion to the additional hassle."

alcohol,38ge29,equus007,2,Thu Jun 4 04:51:28 2015 UTC,What you describe doesn't sound like Rohypnol.  Roofies don't linger for two days and if you are drinking and on them you are the furthest thing from coherent.  Think you were probably drugged though because if it were just booze you'd feel it in the morning.  Done a lot of pills and can't think of any other than anti-psychotics that would effect you for that long and nobody would dose you with those because they would just give you a panic attack.  If you have another illness that might explain it.  I had a similar experience once when I went drinking and had the flu but didn't know it.    Sorry not much help.  Good luck figuring it out.

Like another user said, I think that I was given something more dissociative in nature. Apparently things like Ambien are becoming more common in date rape (we're seeing it now with Darren Sharper) but aren't usually something that patients are tested for.   I suppose was just to see if it's at all likely that I simply drank too much.

Given that we're dealing with likely an under-funded and under-manned hospital I think she would have been lucky to have been seen T-8:00 hours after she'd been drugged.  Which isn't the point. It's certainly likely that she merely blacked out but other redditors have pointed out a number of tell-tale signs that alcohol alone was not responsible for her black out.  The debate of which doesn't accomplish a damn thing for her though. Point is she got very lucky in that she seems to be relatively more or less intact and she just needs to avoid said bar in the future.  Though additionally if I were her I'd contact the bar management. If I managed a bar I would want a heads up if sketchy shit was going on in my establishment. Seriously bad for business."

You said they tested you for street drugs, do you know if they tested for G or K? Pairing either one with alcohol even in small amounts can have huge and dangerous effects. It does sound somewhat like G but without knowing more what your normal drinking sessions are like or how you were feeling at the time I wouldn't be able to guess. Also: both G & K hit you fairly fast. If it did happen, it would have happened at the bar. If you do feel like you got dosed, avoid that bar.

I don't have much insight for you unfortunately, but what you described is not at all possible if you think about what alcohol is and what it does to your body.  You might just have to dust yourself off and be glad that you were largely unharmed. I don't know if this will warrant a change in lifestyle for you (not drinking anymore) but keep in mind that's not a bad thing and you can have just as much fun without alcohol (although it can be great hehe).  I think you'll be fine and can most likely return to old times but maybe don't drink at the bars anymore or get a male that you know and trust to buy drinks seemingly for himself and give it to you. I know that's less fun but hey you've got a damn good excuse for doing that."
alcohol,38ge29,3hirdEyE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:23:24 2015 UTC,"One time I got drugged, or at least I can only assume so as I had only drank the same amount of alcohol I drink on a regular basis. I was playing guitar on stage next to a hot girl playing fiddle so I assume the drugs were meant for her, in which case, I'm glad it was me and not her. I love her to death and would hate to see her drugged.  Anyways, I remember (only after I was told about it later and the memories clicked back in) starting to have trouble staying locked in on the songs, which is highly unusual even when I'm hammered. I just remember thinking, ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"" I completely fucked up the intro to Chicken Fried three times before I just said, ""Fuck it, I can't do it and I don't know why."" And made the other guitar player do it. A couple songs later and we were done. As I lean over to unplug my pedal board with my guitar still in my hands (I never unplug my stuff this way) I toppled over the stage. It's no big deal it's like two stairs about a foot off the ground. I pick myself up and, now entirely perplexed by this feeling, crouch back down in the same spot and fall over backwards.  Those are my only memories of the night as they were the only parts told to me. I got a ride home from said fiddle player and woke up the next morning none the wiser. It wasn't until a week later that the guy I was playing for was like, ""Haha Whatreallyhappens fell off the stage, haha, so drunk,"" that I was like, ""Wait, I remember that, I wasn't even drunk."" Needless to say, I'm personally convinced I was drugged. The moments were not drunk hazy, but very clear yet hard to control. It was kind of like how you said, it feels like more of an out of body experience. You're there, but not really. And the memories are just straight up gone. I always remember when I get black out drunk (not what happens, but the fact that I did), but I didn't even realize that I couldn't remember the night until I was reminded about it. It's fucking weird and unsettling.  My vote is, you were drugged."

alcohol,38fisj,roxigirly,11,Wed Jun 3 21:42:09 2015 UTC,"First, if you're new to alcohol, go out and try new stuff. Have fun, be safe, bring some friends, and take suggestions. Take suggestions from your friends, complete strangers, and if it's not too busy, the bartender. Go to a nice bar, not a dive bar where the most complicated drink is ""liquor name"" and ""mixer name"". This will help you decide what you want and what to have with it at dinner.  As far as dinner, drink orders are placed first. Have a drink to relax, whether because you're thirsty or something to sip on. Then dinner comes. As you run out of a drink, when the server asks if you'd like another, give it a thought: do I want the same thing, something new, or have I had enough? It's completely ok to alternate with water. If you're really partying and you're at a restaurant where it's acceptable, shots usually come after dinner.  Go have (safe) fun, and don't forget to try new things!"
alcohol,38fisj,demented_vector,8,Wed Jun 3 22:17:15 2015 UTC,Ask the server if it's happy hour. Cheaper drink prices. These guys are refined drinkers. You're likely a broke college student. Usually its a few draft beers and jack and cokes.
alcohol,38fisj,masteroftheuniverse6,3,Thu Jun 4 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if you're going to drink alcohol with your dinner, you should pick one thing and stick to it, whether that's beer, wine, or a cocktail. You've got the rest of your life to DRINK ALL THE THINGS, no need to do it all in one night. However, if you order something and it's not what you were expecting or you just don't like it, you're free to ask the waiter for something else. You can also just ask for water or a soft drink, too, if you change your mind about imbibing.  Now, if you're asking about the specific vocabulary for ordering alcohol at restaurants, here's a quick guide.  To order beer, begin by asking, ""What do you have on draft?"" Or ""Could I see a tap list?"" This will get you a set of options for draft (sometimes spelled draught) beer - poured into a glass from a tap. The restaurant may also serve beers by the bottle, and in my experience, the waiter will tell you about these as well. If you're feeling more like wine, you can ask to see a wine list. As with anything else you might order at a restaurant, if you're not sure what to get, ask the waiter for a recommendation.   It's reasonable to expect a place that has a full bar to have all the ingredients on hand to make any IBA cocktail; as long as you stick to basics, you can be confident that they'll serve you whatever you ask for. The cocktails featured on the menu are specialty concoctions, and you are not limited to those. The easiest place to start would be basic mixed drinks - these are the ones with names like ""gin and tonic,"" ""vodka soda,"" or ""whiskey sour,"" where you're literally asking for ""spirit (and) mixer."" The worst that can happen if you stick to these basics is that they're currently out of one of the components, so you simply pick a different spirit or mixer. NB: asking for ""soda"" will always mean club soda, i.e., seltzer water. If you want Coke or Sprite or whatever, you have to ask for it by name.  Some places will list out the various liquors they have available; if you're on a budget, don't specify a liquor brand when ordering a cocktail or mixed drink. Just specifying the type of spirit will get you ""well"" liquor, which is cheap but if you're mixing it it doesn't matter. A ""rum and coke"" will cost you less than a ""Captain and coke,"" if that helps to clarify."
alcohol,38fisj,tehzephyrsong,13,Wed Jun 3 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"Moderation is the name of the game. For most people (and budgets), that's 1-3 per meal. Also, as a rule of thumb, drink what you like to drink.  Depending on your tolerance (WHICH SHOULD BE ZERO SINCE YOU HAVE JUST TURNED 21!), the usual is to start with a drink as the first thing you order (a beer, or cocktail aperitif if you're inclined). This usually lasts through sitting down and appetizers if you're really sipping it down, at which time you'll probably ask for another drink for dinner. Here, the drink should be considered to go with the meal, in which case you might ask your server for a wine (or beer) pairing with your main course. A simple beer that's not too strong works, too. Generally, a cocktail's not ordered a lot here. Or, alternatively, drink what you like to drink. Lastly, there might be a final cocktail/wine (port, sherry, or the like) to go with - or in lieu of - dessert. At this point, you can move to the bar if the group does, and order at the cocktail bar as you intend.  The exception is ""paired"" dinners, which has a wine/cocktail for each course. This is usually offered for 3+course meals, and does add up after a bit. Honestly, for 5+ course meals, I'd offer to split the wine tasting with my date, since I'll be pretty buzzed at the end and won't be able to appreciate the food."

I'm a retired pro chef, I know a whole lot about how the restaurant thing works.  A good server is an incredibly valuable resource for a beginner.  Cocktail first, note the selection of a sugarless standard. No sweets before dinner.  The standard recipe of 5 parts gin to 1 part dry vermouth has been around for about a century and there is only one reason a recipe gets old.  It's good!  Wine with the food.  Again, sweets don't go here.  I am quite knowledgeable on the subject and I'm certain I could choose something to my liking. So why ask the server?  Because he is also quite the expert and may have discussed this with the Chef and other servers and just might have something that will surprise and delight me. In fact, he always has. I do know what I'm doing with wines, but I'm not the least bit uncomfortable with asking for a little help. A beginner might make the mistake of ordering the wrong thing or worse, try to bluff their way into convincing a seasoned pro that they are anything but a newcomer.  Confessing one's ignorance is the first step in learning.  After dinner drink, here's where the liquers get their chance to shine. The place makes a killer Tiramisu and I'll often split one with my wife and I just love the anise taste of Sambucca in a cup of coffee.  The meal is over, time to let my sweet tooth out of it's cage for just a bit.  I keep it on a tight leash.  Three drinks in the course of a two hour meal that's moderation for you."

That being said, most people order a cocktail when the sit down then often change to wine by the glass or by the bottle during dinner.  This isn't necessary, but it is a nice way to bring a table 'together' by sharing the same wine.  As for wine, don't try to create rules like, ""I don't like Chardonnay"" - you sound stupid because Chardonnay can be made in so many different ways, I'm sure you would like at least 1.  Wine is less about grape and more about where it's from - I don't mean country, but areas within that country, like if all 50 states produced wine, they'd be different.  Don't feel you need to order something expensive to be good.  Cordials are things you have after dinner, often very sweet.  (Aperitif is before, to stimulate the appetite so to speak, Digestif is after, to digest.)  After dinner drinks are all over the place, from something in your coffee to a brandy - try all kinds of things."
alcohol,38fisj,Hehlol,0,Thu Jun 4 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"You're over-thinking it and most of the replies in this thread are way over-doing it. There's no need for all this fancy decorum. You're 21 and this isn't a wine mixer.  There's dark and light beers.   Light beers aren't as bitter but some people hate them for this very reason. It's like drinking your coffee with sugar and cream. Some people prefer the fuller character and flavor profile of dark beer and find light beer bland and unpalatable. I'm generally one of those people. That said I sometimes like to go with a light beer with a meal because it's more neutral flavor goes better with different food options.  IMO avoid junk beers like Bud light, Natty Ice, etc. These are watered down and ultra cheap disgusting options. There's no character or flavor. It's like drinking bitter water that gets you a slight buzz and you will be filled with shame and regret afterwords.  Dark beers have more ""flavor"" which for the uninitiated means they're going to be a lot more bitter. The more bitter, the ""better"" the beer is. There are some more palettable middle-ground dark beer options. Dos Equis, Shiner Bok, Blue Moon (yum) etc. I love dark beer but some of it is ultra disgusting. Valkyrie literally tastes like ear-wax. It's party in a can though.  And that leads me to something else to remember about the difference between light and dark beers. Dark beers almost unilaterally hit harder. Heavier beer=heavier buzz. Light beers aren't just light in flavor but in buzz as well. Something to consider when deciding how functional you want to be.  Many restaurants also offer mixed drinks (liquor). IMO these are a colossal waste of money. They'll fill the cup to the brim with ice, pour in mixer about 4/5ths of the way, and sprinkle on a touch of the sauce. If you want the hard liquor experience go grab a 20.00 bottle of whiskey from your local liquor store and get plowed on your living room couch. Have some buddies over. Play some video games. Drink plenty of water (dear god do not ignore this part) and eat a solid meal before bed.  But that's for home. In the restaurant I'd start with one beer and wait until you've stood up to go to the bathroom before deciding on a second. It's easy to feel a lot less drunk than you are until you've stood up and suddenly realized you have no balance. With you presumably having zero tolerance a single dark beer could easily put you in the ""maybe you shouldn't be driving"" zone. If you do get a little too sauced for comfort just ask the waitress for some water and maybe order some coffee if available and wait a good hour. Nobody is going to kick you out for trying to be responsible.  The one thing I can say that will be super frustrating is that the menus generally don't provide much information on what alcoholic options are available. Some restaurants have an alcohol menu (ask the waitress). Sometimes you'll just have to ask the waitress what the restaurant does and doesn't have. Hint: they aren't always helpful. It's a good idea to walk in with at least 3 solid ideas about what you want. 1) something you really want that the restaurant might not carry. 2) a middle option that you really want that is a little more common. And 3) something generic and very common that you can live with if they don't have the first two things you wanted."

There are many more factors that contribute to alcohol tolerance.   Best advice is to have a glass of water in between drinks, it keeps you hydrated which can prevent hangovers and also slows down your alcohol intake."
alcohol,387z3q,gillers1986,2,Tue Jun 2 14:40:10 2015 UTC,agree with the staying hydrated thing.  i thought i was a puker for years before realizing i was just getting dehydrated and not having enough fluid in my inner ear would cause me to get dizzy and vomit.  haven't hurled since from drinking.
alcohol,387z3q,whiskeybridge,2,Tue Jun 2 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"People usually throw up because they drink too much too quickly.  If they're drinking beer it's because they drink more beer than their stomach can physically contain and they stomach has to expel the beer before it pops. same thing would happen if you drank too much soda.  With hard liquor vomit happens when the amount of hard liquor in the stomach is irritating the stomach lining, so the stomach expels the liquor.  It just boils down to how quickly you're drinking. You could probably drink a 12 pack of regular beer in 4 hours with no problems, but if you try to drink a 12 pack in one hour you might vomit.   Also, a half stomach is usually better than a full stomach for drinking. You want something in there to protect your stomach lining and absorb some of the alcohol, but if you're totally stuffed you won't be able to drink much."

alcohol,386ak2,smithandcrossed,6,Tue Jun 2 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"my general attitude is something large, heavy and takes awhile to digest. animal fats and proteins are my go to. the more other stuff your stomach is absorbing, the longer it takes to fully absorb the alcohol. also stays in your system longer. i'll usually take a coffee or two after supper as well to counteract drowsiness."
alcohol,386ak2,TOMATO_ON_URANUS,4,Tue Jun 2 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"This guy is right.  Biologically, protein-heavy meals with moderate fat stimulate your metabolism, giving you more energy. Avoid dairy, which will make you more prone to throwing up. Pizza is alright, a cheese platter not so much. Ultra-lean protein and carbs without fat, like sushi, is also pretty shitty.  Make sure to stay hydrated or your anti-drowsiness tactics will just result in a mega-hangover. Go to your local supermarket and find a product called Pedialyte in the medicine aisle - it's made to hydrate small children who are losing fluids from diarrhea or vomiting. Which makes it perfect for curing hangovers, which is basically extreme dehydration. Plus it tastes pretty good too."

You can try mixed drinks maybe, less alcohol, more of something you enjoy drinking, if you drink casually,  every week or so you can add a little more.   For example, Sprite is a drink that settles the stomach a bit (for me it always has), perhaps try Crown Royal Regal Apple with that, add a bit of lime juice for good measure, stuff tastes like candy, jolly ranchers to be more specific."

alcohol,37vrbw,Cdziewit,1 point,Sun May 31 20:23:37 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about Xanax but mixing alcohol with any type of stronger drug is generally bad.

Our living situation depends on this woman. She just got this bottle yesterday. I don't drink and I honestly don't know how much she's had out of this. I was hoping someone here could give me a better idea. My family thanks you!   Also I should note she promised she wouldn't get drunk and weighs maybe 90 lbs soaking wet.   And has a prescription for Xanax that she mixes. Even if it's only .5 mgs, that's enough to fuck up a person right?"
alcohol,37vrbw,Nuts4Nads,0,Sat May 30 20:25:47 2015 UTC,This seems like an invasion of privacy. She is paying rent to you and you are taking pictures of her barely-touched drink and posting it for strangers to analyze.

alcohol,37s92e,KPowers610,2,Sat May 30 00:35:39 2015 UTC,"As a go-to cheap dry gin, I tend to lean towards Beefeater. Many will disagree with me but I stand by it.   I'd suggest looking around for Bluecoat. It's a little cheaper than Hendrick's and is in the same quality tier."

alcohol,37s92e,DrunkenWizard,3,Fri Jun 12 02:05:53 2015 UTC,The Botanist is my favorite gin by far. But Hendrick's is also very good.

alcohol,37s92e,DrunkenWizard,1 point,Sat May 30 01:59:21 2015 UTC,Can't say for Botanist but Hendricks has a very unique cucumber flavour which is why I adore it so much.
alcohol,37s92e,ihideindarkplaces,2,Sat May 30 02:30:03 2015 UTC,"The botanist I find has a lot of Sibley's subtlies to the flavour, every sip I can pick out a different taste."

Not to hijack the thread but if your into subtlety of flavour, I tried Mokey 47 quite a bit over the pay year and found it excellent in that respect as well! Happy drinking!"
alcohol,37s92e,IHateTheLaw666,3,Sat May 30 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"Plymouth will be lighter and citrusy compared to most london dry gins.  Hendricks will have an off the wall cucumberness to it  Tanqueray is the closest to a proper ""juniper bomb"" with not much else going on. Tanqueray 10 is an even bigger, higher quality juniper bomb.  Beefeater 24 is a very good Juniper forward but citrusy dry gin.  Bombay Sapphire will be very light, not very flavor forward, which is why it's so popular.  Most of these look to be London Dry gins, which is going to limit the variety of flavors - London Dry is almost universally a heavy juniper style. Gordon's, Boodles, regular Beefeater will all be fairly similar to one another with small twists and the biggest difference being simple quality."

I mean, I get how energy drink/vodka combos can be dangerous as some people drink 8 or more drinks in a night without considering the fact that they would never even think about downing that many energy drinks in any other setting. But one controlled dose of caffeine probably wouldn't be a big deal.  Tonnes of people drink coffee before their booze anyways, we're in a society fueld by it for gods sake. Just be careful that you don't stay out longer than you intend to due to your energy levels making it feel like it's 2 hours earlier into the night than it really is."
