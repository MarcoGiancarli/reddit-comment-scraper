depression,3e334l,Delvos,11,Tue Jul 21 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"I've learned my lesson. It took 3x too, but now I keep my mouth shut. I am now under the assumption that people who are seeking help, but still are successful in their plans have done the same. It is a sad commentary on our state of healthcare that people like us avoid the hospitals at any cost. I trust no one now. I've dropped hints, but I just don't care anymore. Can't say I haven't tried. I'm sure you have too, the little bit of humanity left in me hopes you can a little longer. Whatever. I'm glad you got it off your chest. I think you will survive the day, the week, the month. You might not be thriving, but maybe something will come to change your life. That last shimmer of hope is annoying, I know."
depression,3e334l,27clubapplicant,7,Tue Jul 21 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I've got admitted once already just by saying that I think about suicide almost daily and that I already know how I would do it. Luckily I was able to avoid it by promising to the head of the psychiatrist department that I won't kill myself, which of course was a lie, because, come on, I come in there as suicidal, how could I possibly know that I won't kill myself? But whatever, as I said with my post, my current compromise is that I still tell my doctors about being suicidal, but I won't tell the last bit about having everything prepared. This should keep me safe from the hospital.  Thank you again for responding, I really appreciate it! I hope you're doing well!"
depression,3e334l,smerek84,4,Tue Jul 21 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"This completely. I stopped seeing my doctor and some friends have been recommending new ones to me, but I'm afraid that if I get too honest with them I will definitely be admitted to a hospital.."
depression,3e334l,bigmac4812,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an unfortunate situation.. I felt that my doctor, the one who admitted me once, wasn't really prepared to deal with a situation like this, so he just brushed me off to the hospital. However, as I said, I wasn't admitted after all and they said that I should go back to him again for regular checkups. Oh god, the look on his face when I came back into his office again and told him that I wasn't actually admitted and that I still have suicidal thoughts of course.. I feel sorry for him for having to deal with a grim case like me.  But, depending on where you live and what the law states about this kind of thing there, you might be able to open up a little bit about these thoughts without being admitted to the hospital, like I do now. It's still not the full truth of course, but I'd say it's better than telling them nothing at all. Wish you well!"
depression,3e334l,bigmac4812,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, what you have to realize is that doctors are under huge legal scrutiny when it comes to patient suicide. Everything that goes on in your interactions with him/her if documented so if you do in fact take your own life, all of those files will be under a microscope to see if there was a high clinical suspicion of you actually acting on your impulses. As a rule, if a patient shows intent and a calm, logical plan to do so, they will admit you to the hospital not only for their own legal protection but for your safety. From the perspective of the psychiatrist, they'd rather be the one who admitted a patient who was never going to commit suicide than be too dismissive of the one who will. After all, most physicians care more about the health of their patients than anything else. But you're right to an extent: different psychiatrists have different levels of confidence in their patients and themselves and so that tends to cause some variation in judgment when deciding if they feel comfortable enough avoiding admission and working more with you as an outpatient."
depression,3e334l,Ray_adverb12,3,Tue Jul 21 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's right, I know that it's a quite hairy situation for doctors/psychiatrists, I couldn't imagine doing a job like that myself. I was with another doctor today and he was different than the one who admitted me once. He said that he actually would have to admit me, but he won't because he doesn't want to force me into it. It's a risk for him of course, I'm actually surprised that he didn't admit me now thinking back.. Anyways, I have huge respect for those people, doctors, psychiatrists. And I feel guilty for them if I should really end it for me, I would be causing them problems when in fact they are truly wonderful people trying to just help people."

But please don't worry about them, the last thing they would want is for you to struggle even more because you fear hurting them. Right now you are trying to overcome a great obstacle, and all of your resources should be focused on that, as well as the resources of those willing and able to help you. Please work on you, and try to remember that there is always help for you, you do not have to suffer in silence, and that there are people who care more about you than you might ever know :)"

But yes, I sort of do hope for hopelessness, because then I could just end my miserable existence and be done with it. Still having some hope left keeps me from doing it, so I have to ""endure"" my life until there is no hope left anymore.  edit: My visit to the mental hospital was rather short, they just diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, prescribed pills (SNRI) and recommended that I should visit a therapist and attend group therapy."

In the end it's probably just a matter of time until I just can't take it anymore, the moment when I decide that it's not worth anymore holding on a slim shimmer of hope. Or maybe something miraculously changes for the better.. (yeah, right..)  Actually I'm not sure if talking like this is really healthy.

Today, shit hit the fan with my family and I am once more, now almost 4-5 times this month, on the edge. It's the spiral of hope, then fear then despair then helplessness which gives rise to hope that stars will align (I won't believe it until I see it.) Plus, I read all these amazing posts about how one guy got laid off and then found a better paying job and is now relaxing for a few weeks.   It's killing me inside everyday. It's like a mental prison which once you enter you can never leave. And you get angry at the fact that you can't leave, you question and you plead you continually weep at this hopelessness. The despair keeps catching you, then you see a light which you hope gives you your freedom, only to see it add another wall. Just everyday crushing you deeper until you don't know who you are and what you can do. No belief, no love and just the touch and promise of hope. You become the perfect prisoner."

No passion for life? It seems like you can type fine and your thoughts are coherent. Are you paranoid? like do you see messages in every little action? Are things arranged oddly? Just pausing and not doing anything for 45 minutes and having really bad memory is a sign of some mental illnesses, you are probably about 20 years old so some mental conditions can start to manifest at that age, schizophrenia etc.."

depression,3e3807,kashivretwo,3,Tue Jul 21 20:38:18 2015 UTC,"My depression manifested as panic attacks. I was 19 when they hit, and 25 before I found a solution. I went through 5 years of talk therapy, every blood and physical eval test I could take, and finally - FINALLY, decided to try meds.  Meds are not to be taken (snork, taken...) lightly, or to be taken without full knowledge of the possible side effects and A PLAN for the future of either taking the meds or weaning off of them. Too many doctors throw pills at things without even thinking about the next refill, much less the long term issues.  It's up to us as patients to do that.  Also, depression is not a will power thing. It isn't a flaw in your character.  It is a flaw and misfire in your chemical brain/body.  While it is beneficial to fight your own way through it to some extent, don't mistake its ability to withstand you. Please, PLEASE get some help with your battle.  I'm not saying you need to take meds to win and manage this, but you DO need to speak to medical professionals about what is going on with you.  Also, if a doctor you visit doesn't feel right in your gut to you, go to another one.  I can't stress this enough.  I had 5 out of 6 doctors tell me I had to try every med for 6 weeks minimum before I could decide if it worked.  I finally met a doctor who said ""If the med is not working for you (meaning there was zero or negligible improvement, and the side effects were awful) on day 3, it isn't going to work in the future.  Stop taking it and move on to the next one.""  I've been on meds since I was 25. They saved my life. They made it possible for me to function like a normal human being. They do not make me feel anything but regular and normal. There is no high, there is no disconnect, there is just being normal.  I had to do a lot of work question a lot of authority, and test a LOT of alternatives before I landed here.    Talk to doctors, do research on-line. Exercise (which I know, is hilarious, considering you can't even consider getting out of bed in a timely manner...trust me, I have been there) as much as you can, since that releases some good depression fighting chemicals into your bloodstream.   It's not going to be easy. Even if you are lucky enough to have the most fantastic doctor ever on the fist hit. This isn't ever going to be easy and you are likely going to have to dance with it the rest of your life. But do not let it take you down before you do everything you can to fight back.    Your school should have a medical program of some kind you can take advantage of.  It is a place to start and it is there for you to use for this exact kind of thing.  USE IT."

Maybe explain to your Dad that you need his guidance, and that you want more than anything else is to do well. Tell him that right now you are feeling so down that you are feeling hopeless. Everyone feels lost sometimes and those are the times that you must let someone know what is going on with you. You are going to feel lost even as a 50-year old - thats just life.

But what I can tell you, is that if you do decide to do this, you're eliminating every chance of it getting better. Your dad may be a twat, but ask yourself, is he worth ending your life? It's YOUR life, not his. You need to live for yourself, and do things to satisfy your own standards. It may be extremely shitty now, but if you reach out for help, you might find the support you need to eventually start getting better, and then establishing yourself well enough to get away from the poison in your life.

I do have a family, friends, home, income, other job possibilities, numerous skills and gifted intelligence that opens up a lot of doors. And I'm physically healthy to boot. There's nothing extraordinary about what I have, but ordinary is just fine for anyone to live a decent, contented life. I even know what minor step changes need to happen in my routine to boost my mood.  I simply don't want to. I'd rather self-destruct. There's a comfort in this dark place much as there must be of children who grow up in abusive households and put themselves right back into abusive relationships throughout their adulthood.  You are what you feel. And I feel worthless."

Once upon a time, only the thought of a new episode of my favorite tv show or video game got me through the day. Then I started drinking to find some courage in social settings. Then I started watching tv/movies or playing a game after I came home. Then it became these things are more entertaining when I'm drunk. Now it's, I can't find enjoyment in these things unless I'm drunk. Followed by what I'm noticing now is, I can't be home more than an hour after work without having to drink just to be. I read the day I can't even get through my workday without drinking, I think I'd just give up if I fell that far."

The right therapist can help sort out what's worth living for for you. I say for you because it's different for everyone. What someone else uses as motivation for living might not work for you and what works for you might not for someone else. I hope you can find what you're looking for.

Then I re-read it, and your story, and I do feel your pain.  I'm sure you know better than me, but depression is as difficult to deal with as it is weird and hard to understand. If playing Fallout 4 (or the anticipation) keeps you going, then at least that's healthier than wanting to die.  Everyone needs something to look forward to. For you and me it's Fallout 4, for someone else it might be a night out, the Olympics, or the Eurovision Song Contest, or takeaway and board games night.. it's the little things that make all the pain worth it.   I too have been thinking a lot of death, and I can't quite get my head around it. I guess I am just too stubborn to actually do it, like, I've been through all this shit and dealt with so much pain, why am I going to just let something beat me? I haven't gone through all this for nothing.  Anyway, more importantly, FO4 is gonna be frickin' sweet!!

That little bit of effort that you need to get up and going is shitty to exhaust, be because it doesn't seem like anything is there to push you. But that's where a certain bit of magic happens. When you find yourself pushing hard enough to alleviate whatever pains you feel in your mind you find it easier to appreciate yourself more and grasp that certain sense of self worth we all want and need to function properly day to day. I understand chemical imbalances and sometimes there isn't any other option but to take medication, but you have a good start. Something you're passionate about that you can get much more deeply involved with and help in a sense. It'll distract you a bit and put a certain obligation in your life that you actually enjoy.

And now with how advanced our technology is, and how creative we are collectively, there's more and more games to look forward to, some better than others, but they're still there.   Harder said than done, don't give in.  You've got quite a few people here supporting you and I'm positive that even us redditors would be incredibly sad, depressed and crushed if you gave in.

I'm not sure how long you're on your parents' plan, but once you're on your own insurance, I'd try talking to someone and try some kind of medication. It can really help sometimes. Maybe after Fallout 4 comes out, you can convince yourself to hold off until you've tried professional help, in case that works."

It's hard to talk about this to most people, because they think it's a good thing. It's not, it's really depressing when you start to lose one of your few hobbies that you have.  Alhtough I have to say, last few weeks I did play a lot again, thanks to ""Alien: Isolation"" and  ""The Witcher 3"", but as of yesterday my enjoyment of those dropped very low again. I kinda forced me to play last night, just to not sit in my room and stare at the walls again.. I actually played ""Solitaire"" from time to time now, just to keep me occupied.  I do have some other hobbies which people usually think are very ""good"", namely reading and going for walks. But I mostly enjoy those for similar reasons that I like gaming. Occupying my mind so I wouldn't think to much, and avoiding having to deal with people..  As for Fallout, I was very excited when they announced it, but it only lasted for a day. Now I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy it, for the reasons I mentioned..  I've started taking anti-depressants like one and a half months ago but don't feel any effects as of yet. Hoping that'll change, but I doubt it.  Don't really have advice for you, just wanted to say I feel you and if you'd like, PM me. This is a second account I just started for /r/depression if anybody's wondering.   Hang in there!  /edit: Also, I just saw your Thread about mindfuck movies. You may like my favourite movie ever, it isn't mindfuck though. It's called ""The Man From Earth"".

If so, you haven't played your favorite video game yet, met some of your coolest friends yet, been to unexpectedly awesome places yet, found true love(maybe), found your favorite band, had your favorite party, and on and on. If you need an endorphin boost, exercise helps. lifting weights, taking a hike, hell, even walking through a park helps. I went into the Grand Canyon back in April when I was 230 pounds, staying in my room every day because I hated both myself and the people around me, and brought a 45 pound backpack with me. Went down, nearly got myself killed(lack of water + salt to retain said water = dehydration with all new hallucinations!), and was walking like a geriatric for a week afterward.  But you know what? Afterward, I felt like I could do anything. I started to lose more weight, I could walk faster, and I actually started getting comments from women on my looks(which I don't think I got before). My somewhat rambling and half-cocked suggestion to you is this= find something thats a huge challenge for you.

You don't need money to live its just pieces of paper when it comes down to it. Yeah it can make a difference between suffering and stress and living but I figure the value I have within me is what earns me the money. Its what I do for other people.

We celebrated midsummer a little over a month ago and the subject depression suddenly came up. People started to compare treatments, meds they'd been prescribed and therapy sessions they'd attended.

Instead they keep pressuring me to find a job and fix all of their problems and it's just so tiring having to take on the weight of not only my problems but theirs.   I feel so overwhelmed all the time I cry myself to sleep every night."

The ones who understood and wanted to know more have become and incredible support system! It can be hard to tell them and to start the conversation but it helps to end the stigma around depression. One step at a time. I wish you the best!"
depression,3e1smg,natasha714,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"For about seven or eight years I kept it totally hidden, but after I got out of hospital I just decided I was sick of constantly hiding such a big part of myself from people. For anyone here who's had bad experiences with telling friends, I'm truly so sorry. For me, it was really liberating, and it really helped me to become more comfortable not being super-perky and chatty all the time with other people.   If someone is truly your friend they'll be there for you. If not, then you don't need any more source of pain in your life, and they don't deserve to be your friend. It's taken a long time to get to the point I'm at, but for me it really helped talking to people around me. If you're not comfortable doing that, that's completely fine, but having people know that I trust means I don't beat myself up over not calling/texting back, or even just having the option to say 'I'm not feeling great today' is a relief for me."

Take care of yourself everyday, like you are about to go out, and get a life turning moment that changes everything for you ( you dont want life to catch you with your pants down do you? :p aahah thats where part of the expression comes from )  stay strong and believe in yourself, even when others dont :) The secret is to prove the world how wrong they are about you, you're a strong indenpendent person!"

Unless there's some clinical historic that depression runs in your family, in my point of view ( and this is just my opinion ), depression is acquired during your life ( i too have it, some days its bad, but its been getting better ). And i was perfectly fine until i was like 16, then i met someone with depression and it was like it got to me..  The world is telling you what in my opinion , is the reality, and what you should totally listen to it. we usually look at the bad things in the world, and we get so blindly focused on them that we forget the beauties of our magic world..  Suicide might be a thing that you're truely deciding by yourself, but it's not the correct one my friend.. it might seem, but it will only prevent you from being present in the future, and experiencing life in a better way..   There's a lot of ways to deal with this, and one of them is to speak up to people and im proud that you're doing so. I dont feel that you should take your own life tho.. It is true tho, you can accomplish anything that you set your mind to, there's a lot of cases of people who finally did it through depression..  Just do one thing for me will ya? Even tho you dont know me from aynwhere just, at night, write down on a note pad, everything that you are thanksful for having ( it can be anything, even your pen, your pc/laptop, or a carrot :) nobody's gonna judge you here ) and what you want to do in the future, for your own good.  Keep doing it everyday until you no longer need to write it down to feel better, whenever you feel like taking your own life, read the notepad and remind yourself of the things that made you smile for just a second.. It was for a second, but you smiled.. There's hope , hold on to it"

Maybe try a new treatment to depression. Before you give up, please, try something new.   Once I'm gone I won't be alive, so I won't feel regret, remorse, anxiety, pain, or any of my various other emotions that already exclude pleasure and happiness.

Of course, then you'd still have to say you have a problem, which can suck. You can talk to a school nurse or counsellour  about it, and I don't know how it is where you live but there should be good help lines, online mental health pages were psychologists can answer and phone lines.

The only notable side effect I encountered was when I skipped a pill or two, I would have withdrawal symptoms, (chills, twitching, hot flashes, and an overall uncomfortable feeling).  I am not on anything right now and unless absolutely necessary, I try to stay away from those types of medicine. However, at the time, taking an antidepressant was the healthiest option for me.  If in your case you'd be healthier taking an antidepressant at this time, lexapro is safe when taken as directed. Also, if you decide to stop taking it in the future, talk to your doctor about weaning off the drug as opposed to stopping cold turkey. It will minimize the withdrawal and save you the discomfort.

But I think most people in our state of mind can find resemblance in metaphors; especially ones about getting thrown off track. Getting derailed. Being pulled over. Failing with the next step in the dance.  I in particular like metaphors as it opens up a whole world of possibilities in terms of getting to terms with eachother.  To paraphrase your metaphor, meetings with people and interacting with society overall is a burden and often leads to a downward spiral of disappointment, frustration, anger, and/or sadness.  How someone on the other side - the ""normal"" people - can't understand this is a travesty. It should be a simple and logical task to piece together; honestly though, it's not. We've just begun mapping interaction (i.e. the Transactional Analysis theory by Eric Berne) and although it's clean on paper reality proves to be more difficult and fluid.  One more thing. Most people who seek connection can identify in metaphors; just food for thought."

You're right that it's not going to do anything good except a temporary feeling.   A lot of people wonder what true happiness feels like, and we spend most of our lives chasing that happiness. It's doled out to us in little bits and pieces, a happy interaction with a loved one, recognition for doing something good, but we never reach a level of 'happiness' and say that we're done, our life is good now. We're always seeking something new.   I agree you should look at what truly makes you happy, or even what you think would make you feel good about yourself. You can accomplish these things if you're not afraid of the work (as you say), and if the outcome doesn't work, then you try something else. At least you had the guile to stand up and do something the way you wanted to, and can feel proud about that."

Here are the replies from those:  ""I can totally relate man it's a comfort zone...I hope this helps somehow but yeah I definitely relate""  ""I've got depression too so I can relate to people coming up to me with the most ridiculous excuses""  ""I hope you have (or can find) a good support system. You are the most important person in your life, and you don't deserve to feel this way.""  ""Hey. I care. And you aren't a burden to those who aren't obsessed with themselves. Can you get professional help? That would be ideal, but if you can't, PM me. I might not have a lot to help you with, but I'm a great listener!""  ""Sweetie, talk to us. Most of us have been there and we wouldn't say go ahead and talk about it if we didn't care.""  ""If you're open to talkin with me, I'd love to hear ya out. I mean, us sad people gotta stick together, right?""  After reading all that, if the OP still feels like they aren't getting any support, I don't feel like it's out of line to suggest that they need to re-evaluate the types of response they are actually receiving."
depression,3e1ysd,peaksix,-5,Tue Jul 21 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"I was making no claim with regard to other threads or comments, just that one.  But looking at those, that is not support. These are platitudes. There is no help.  This is pointless. I can't take this."
depression,3e1ysd,smallscaredchild,8,Tue Jul 21 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe phrases like ""you don't deserve to feel this way"" are hollow to you. But offering to talk and listen to OP because they've been in his/her shoes in the past is the very definition of what help and support are (at least in terms of what you can do as an anonymous person on the internet)."
depression,3e1ysd,peaksix,7,Tue Jul 21 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"This is how help starts though, there are a few people just in that list who have offered to talk with you. You have to start somewhere. I will also offer to listen if you want to talk.  The next point would be, what HELPS you? Each of us deals with the depression in a different way. I, like to push everyone away and become a shut in. If talking doesn't help you, maybe we can suggest hobbies or exercise routines or who knows what else.  I wish you wouldn't feel like this is pointless, there really are people out there who give a fuck, even about a stranger.   Depression is horrible, I know, I've had it for a LONG time.   Please let us help, or let someone help."
depression,3e1ysd,Prisaneify,2,Tue Jul 21 14:12:40 2015 UTC,In my opinion you completely misjudged/misread his tone there. He just stated the obvious and the most moderate way to look at feedback. He's as much part of the problem as we both are.
depression,3e1ysd,yinsanity,3,Tue Jul 21 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"What makes you feel that way? I know it can sometimes feel like posts here go completely unnoticed, and therefore no one cares - do you feel that's happening to you?"
depression,3e1ysd,TerminalStar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it kinda depends on who's online at the moment and what kind of day they're having. After all, ironically, you are posting in a place that's also dominated by depression. Coming here to get help is a 2-way road, man. Or maybe you just can't get the help you need here."
depression,3e1ysd,yinsanity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"This is my first time visiting this sub, and it seems like a good place to go for venting, advice, and tips, but it doesn't strike me as a good place for support. It's not that these people don't care, it's that they're strangers. We may know what you're going through, but we don't know you. I think support should probably come from friends and family that truly care about you."
depression,3e2qpg,cmarydai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Most of the time I just have to ride it through and wait for it to pass. It's the weirdest feeling, where your most basic needs like eating or sleeping become these things that your body doesn't even respond to. I often refer to it as being a ghost.   I wish I could offer a solution or treatment, but like you, I just have to experience it until it's over. Good luck."
depression,3e2qpg,Oath24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:26 2015 UTC,I also experience this. My therapist is at a loss for what I should do about it though. She keeps saying I should force myself to do something and I'll find pleasure in it later but I'm not sure if that's the answer.

depression,3e2odi,Spookstreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:49 2015 UTC,"For some people I don't think that it does go away on its own. There are very different types of depression. Some are temporary and some you need to work at every damn day. I'm the latter.  It's manageable though. Yes I'm having a relapse at the moment, but that's due to circumstances and that I've stopped doing the things I know I need to do to not feel this way.  I did Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for mine, combined with Citralopram, and it really helped. I came off the pills 6 months ago and had been feeling great. As long as you're vigilant, aware of what triggers you, and willing to put in the effort to get over that hump, you don't have to feel like this, I promise."

depression,3e2odi,deepblacknothing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:40 2015 UTC,You're welcome. I was so sick of being told that it would just magically go away eventually - it meant that I wasted so much time not getting the help I needed.
depression,3e22cx,shrodi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, OP, what's making you feel this way?"
depression,3e22cx,TheFloofycat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Living is inherently painful, and enduring pain without reason or relief is very much like a chore.   Much like the dishes you can't do anything to escape it, only endure it every time in the service of some greater purpose. A purpose which evidently doesn't exist, at least for people in this state. We do it anyway, because in a sense even to refuse the dishes is to bring forward the prospect of suicide and make it immediate.  Could living be anything other than painful? Well, even if it could, the idea of staying alive doesn't bother me because it's painful, but because there's no reason to tolerate the pain.   There's no reason to bother with pleasure either, as far as I can tell, even when I can feel it. Well, that's true in a certain sense. I'll do the dishes, though they're dull, and I'll experience sensory pleasure when it's there, but I'd give it up all up if only I didn't have to ever do it again."

Taking something to do in the meanwhile also helps, but that part just depends on you."
depression,3e35uw,yinsanity,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"Tons of places have free WiFi. If you're tired of the library, mix it up! Do you have a local park that's smaller than a forest preserve? especially a dog park, you can watch them all play =)   You could also volunteer towards any organization you fancy. It's totally free, people value your time and effort, you get to socialize a bit, and you feel good at the end!"
depression,3e35uw,TheFiksman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"I actually applied to two different volunteer places. My local hospital, and an animal adoption place. I haven't heard back from either, but I had to fill out an application for both. I don't know if maybe my application got rejected?"
depression,3e35uw,TheFiksman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's great! I doubt you got rejected, but you could always call and inquire. More than likely, you applied to volunteer at some places that don't currently have a need for volunteers.   If you want immediate return, scout out places that are actively seeking volunteers for an upcoming event. Morning radio shows often do that, and sometimes the evening news. Look up shelters or soup kitchens, those places always need good people like you. There's also those big brother/big sister programs where you spend some time with kids in need where you just go around and do fun stuff together. The world is your oyster!"

A lot of volunteer programs are disorganized, so I agree, I would recommend calling to follow up.  Once I tried to volunteer with an organization, and it took them a year to get back to me.  Yeah...there are plenty of groups out there that will value your time/effort, so you don't have to be stuck with places that don't."

And I love that you mentioned your cat (they rock, after all!)  The only thought that really comes to mind is this one -- Keep in your mind the fact that depression is not about character, it is an illness.  Perfect lives cannot promise immunity for any other illness, and the guilt trap of feeling bad for not feeling good is counter-intuitive but also very much normal.  Trying to be mindful of the rules here, and not say something that will seem like pointless fluff.  I know cheerleading can be a darned nuisance.  But really, a brilliant cat (is that tautology?!) and a premium gaming rig would not shield you from flu or GERD or..other things I can think of.  It's not a panacea here either BUT if those things give some comfort or relief then that's OK too."
depression,3e25sl,V_North,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:30:50 2015 UTC,"It's hard to get really deep into it, but depression isn't always triggered by having a bad life, in some cases it's just there like it's pointing out that something really important is missing, but you have no idea and can't even start to think what it is. Or at least that's my view on it. I'd advise you to get a new hobby besides the ones you already have, might help, might not help, but trying brings a chance of distraction at least."

I have never been able to pin down what it is but I get those same random bouts of depression and severe anxiety. You feel like a shell and that the only thing propelling you is the fact that you're living and you don't want to waste that. (At least that is the way it is for me) I also feel that ""small talk"" is useless and doesn't contribute to anything, not to mention I am terrible at it (high-functioning is a bitch).  One thing that has helped me is talking to my parents about it. I've had the same feelings as you for years. I set up a keyword system with my mom what when ever I turn to her and say a specific word (dingleberry for instance) that she now knows that depression is setting back in and I need help.   I hope the best for you. Maybe one day we'll figure out why we are here and how to get out of it :)."
depression,3e2apk,Heyhouyou,3,Tue Jul 21 12:16:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy and I go to a female proctologist. Now get over it! ;-) - No, seriously, I have at least one field where I avoid seeing a female doctor, and I'm also seeing a male psychiatrist. My gut feeling is that he can relate better to my issues.   Do what you're comfortable with. Unless you are in a really dark place and need immediate help, wait those 3 weeks instead of opting for something you're uncomfortable with.  You haven't written a whole lot about what you experienced and what you observed, but the few things you wrote in the first paragraph will be a good starting point for your visit at the psychiatrist. There will be no brain scan, don't be afraid. He'll ask you about your life situation, medication, drugs and so on, and about what you observed about your mental condition, whether you've ever contemplated suicide and so on. You don't need to put up a show to make him believe you, just be yourself. Don't be afraid, try not to build up too much suspense in those three weeks."

I don't feel particularly worried about relating with a male but I just feel much more comfortable sharing my close thoughts and feelings with females.  The first visit my psychiatrist asked some questions and let me talk out what I was feeling and going through. Now I go in and it is very simple, ""How are you feeling? Are the meds doing okay? Having any unwanted side effects?""  If you are in a bad spot and really need to see someone before your appointment you can try one of the female doctors or an out of town psychiatrist, since that seems to be an option.  Best of luck!"

One extreme would be that they have own experience with depression, have already noticed something wrong with you and would be relieved if you opened up about it. The other extreme of course are completely negligent and ignorant parents, which we see here far too often.   I really can't offer any sound advice, other than that I wouldn't mind at all if one of my children messaged me and told me that they have done some research on the web and believe they suffer from depression. It would be so much preferable to dealing with substance abuse, suicidality or cutting. But that's probably just because I have experience with depression myself.   In general, there is a chance that your parents are less narrow-minded than you fear. We old farts do have sides which our children have no idea that they even exist. ;-)"

depression,3e23ez,jonathino001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  Agree, your question is a valid one in that it is something people often ask themselves.  Yes, depression has variable degrees but it is also like pain -- a very subjective experience, and therefore hard to quantify in a meaningful way.  Before you consider measuring yourself against others, consider this analogy -- Imagine there are three guys in hospital.  One guy has a broken leg.  The guy next to him has lost his leg in an accident.  The guy next to him has a lethally infected leg wound.    Surely guy three has it worse, right?  Except the pain that guy three is in does not take away the pain of guy one and guy two, nor does it fix them or heal them in any way.  The point is -- if we only measure our pain and suffering against others, there is always someone ""worse"", right?  Except this changes nothing for our own subjective experience of pain, discomfort or distress.  The point, which I am laboring over, is that you don't need to measure your condition against others.  And you are absolutely valid in wanting to get through it, in tending yourself, looking after yourself, and getting the help you need.  Indeed, to measure ourselves against others is a bear trap to try and avoid."

At my worst I was thinking about it 30+ times a day. At my best only a couple of times. Even during the happiest moments of my life I was thinking about it. As you said, this is suicide ideation. But they can also be intrusive thoughts. Violent imagery of what to do to myself enters my head without me prompting it.  The one constant in my life has been my preoccupation with suicide and death. It is the biggest part of me and yet no one I knows about it. I guard it like my biggest secret. Am I ashamed? I'm not sure, but I do my best to hide it. I have even hid the severity of my problem from my psychiatrist. It is my fucking right to take my own life if I damn well please, and I'm not going to let another human being take it from me. Sick?

Kind of interesting, because it opens the door to the sole reason of having nothing to live for. It would be interesting to hear a philosophical conversation on the merits of allowing people to end it all because of utter dejection versus encouraging people to hold on to life for a bit despite the profound pain"
depression,3dzdrl,mikeywilldunk,4,Tue Jul 21 12:12:11 2015 UTC,"I used to. It's actually very recently after about 8 years, that I don't have suicidal idealizations on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. It started as being indifferent to death. I wanted to live a long time but I was tired of fighting, every day was a drain and I wasn't making any progress. I was in the Air Force much of this time.   It even landed me in the ER a few times as I was acting incredibly suicidal, in what I honestly felt as normal behavior. I had gotten extreme in my mannerisms and daily interactions. Didn't see it.   Drugs and Alcohol felt like fake happiness, borrowed joy from tomorrow or when it wore off. Something when I would volunteer or do something to stay busy...  After the service I started dance, something I enjoyed doing especially since I got a lot more female attention. As well as getting into role playing, D&D and horseback riding. I wound up helping a girl clean her barn, spending days cleaning and organizing the place, and dumping a lot of time into local improvements.   Skip around 2 years alter to a few months ago. I had realized I feared knives, (used to cut myself) and would go through days without hoping for death. Daydreaming of ending it or going to sleep one last time so I can finally just... rest.  What helped me was a lot of work and luck. I made friends that enjoy my company, I do things I enjoy which are mostly D&D, pursing development of my own MMO, a life long dream of mine, dancing, playing a musical instrument and someone that gets me out of bed when I'm still struggling. On occasion I still ride horses and am still working on the girls ranch.   We're dating now. She's my boss and helps me work towards my goals as I help her with hers.  ... I honestly don't know if this helps. I hope it does. It was a long road."

depression,3e1qr7,jaywarbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:45:36 2015 UTC,"For me it was all initially coming from that negative place with the self-hate but that motivated me in a twisted way like I was punishing myself or something like that. Even though it was messed up I went with it and I let it evolve into something positivity-motivated. I guess you can't always expect to jump right into being positivity-motivated immediately when all you have is the negativity to work with.  And then I eventually saw that I was getting better at it and that's when the shift to positivity began. Before that, I was too hung up on the hate and shit to notice any feelings of defeatism from not being better at it faster.  I don't get what you mean by getting bored, though. There's no room for me to be bored when I'm pushing myself in something. I'll either be frustrated or pumped or something, anything. Or maybe that's just my personality because I'm never really bored.  What do you mean by having a disgusting looking body only you can see, though? If you're talking about body dysmorphia and you see yourself differently from what you actually look like, that's a whole different animal I know nothing about...  EDIT: Read some of your past posts. I'm not suggesting that what worked for me will work for you. In fact exercising for exercise obviously doesn't work for you.

I'm starting small - my goal is 10,000 steps a day, with daily runs/jogs contributing to that target - and I hope that it'll grow into a positive habit. At the same time I'm wondering whether this fixation with exercise isn't just another avoidance strategy on my part from dealing with whatever it is in my life that's a mess (i.e. work).

Without them, I couldn't see any way out of how I was feeling, with them, I was still in the dark, but it was like someone had given me a torch so I could begin to work my way out. Biggest mistake I made was to come off them because I felt better.  Don't get me wrong, the side effects can suck, especially at first and especially if you're given a high dose. I had nausea, loss of sex drive and some loss of impulse control at first. My girlfriend had a really bad reaction and never touched them again.

I tried out various medications until I ended up with something that worked for me, and even then I still have to deal with side effects.  They're not too bad, though, and most of the side effects weaken or disappear with time.  I'd like to emphasize to OP, though: anti-depressants will not totally cure your depression.  They'll make your depression manageable enough so you can function and get therapy.  I remember the first couple of days on anti-depressants.  It felt amazing to no longer feel like shit.  I wasn't happy; just not sad.  But it felt like a thousand pounds were lifted off my shoulders."

ADs are a lot more subtle. It takes forever until the veil of depression starts to lift, but then you'll start to be better without even noticing it. The meds don't induce happiness or something, but you'll look back at that day when you wanted to be dead, and wonder if that really was the same person. They can have annoying side effects, but other than with cannabis, you'll be fully functional.  Be prepared that a psychiatrist will ask you about your use of weed, and be honest so it doesn't fuck with his therapy. Cannabis seems to be pretty common among us. ;-)"

For example, I was very determined not to take any meds that would cause weight gain or affect my sex life, as I know that would cause me a lot of stress and reduce the quality of my life. So my doctor made a list of meds that were less likely to cause those side-effects, and I've been going through them.  Just to say, you do still have off-days on ADs.

Why don't you ask your doctor for a possible prescription for anti-depressants? I didn't want ssris because of weight gain(had anorexia before, and the idea of weight gain is abhorrent to me), was looking at wellbutrin(weight loss!), my doc recommended my current prescription.

I'm lucky enough to experience little to no side effects. Not to say I don't still have bad times but it helped bring me up to normal so when I dip low again I know it is possible to return to some semblance of normalcy. Go to a psychiatrist and try to find out what works for you but one thing is that having a good therapist can be almost as good as meds. My therapist is amazing so it's the double whammy of meds helping my mood and my therapist helping me to find the causes of my depression and anxiety and help me to change what I'm unhappy with.

depression,3e31lr,throwawaychique7,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't. My boss and I were actually fairly close, there were a number of times that he'd call me at 11pm to ask for help on a project. We joked around in the office.  With that in mind, if you plan on switching jobs you might not want to tell him or her, even if that trust is there. If you put him or her down as a reference, you never know who they will talk to and what they might say. They might assume that you won't work as hard if you're struggling. It's risky!  I told my boss that I was having stress or that I had doctor's appointments, I never told him that I was too depressed to work or that I was going to see my psychiatrist."

Major depression is actually a screening question at most businesses now.

depression,3e31lr,stephentheatronach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"Again it really depends on the boss. If you think that they would understand about it than go ahead. Maybe also ask about changing position first, then you can even say your performance and outlook may change for the better of you change positioning. Citing the reason for being down as your current position may help as long as you don't go into the full details as it may hurt your ability to retain your position if you are not allowed to change."

I absolutely despise asking for more money because I'm such a loser that can't keep a job.  I'm 44 years old and still getting speeches about budgeting and snarky remarks when I do get an interview about the reasons I lost the last job.

But, since my father is also crazypants (as is nearly that whole side of the family) I have, after a really long time, gotten the fuck over it. Here's my best:   This is my life. I can only do what I can do. And, that happens to be far less than I'd like. But, what I have found is that there's a really wonderful life that can be made inside all this. And, sure, it's not the life I wanted or envisioned. And, it's not the life that everyone thought I'd have. But, it sure as hell beats berating myself and all the self loathing.  My question for you is What kind of help and support are you getting for managing your mental illness?"
depression,3dyksc,PlutoHa,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"Help and support? What are these alien words?  I have the full faith and backing of the world wide web and the support of all the crackpots you would ever care to acknowledge.   Also my own personal education provided by the decrepit and woefully underfunded mental health services of the state of Kansas. (Thank you mr. Brownbeck and those who came before you)  My parents are too old to be able to help other than keeping me from being homeless and those siblings who could give a shit have issues and troubles of their own.  So to make a long story long, just me baby, just me. I have become an oscar worthy actor so that my kids stay as unaffected as possible. (But I know they are nonetheless) This life I lead now is exactly what I wanted to avoid when I attempted all those times before. Unfortunately I am equally a failure at that.  I don't typically wax poetic like this and I may yet delete this response like so many others. I don't seek sympathy or help but I do apologize for the wall of text.   In summary...none.

But all the things I wanted to accomplish, all the things I wanted to do and see and create. Meh. Why bother. I used to get great joy out of some hobbies (namely astronomy). It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but I loved it, read about it, thought about it, worked on it, improved myself. Now it's been months since I even thought about going out. I used to spend all week anticipating a clear night so I could pack up my car, drive out to the country and spend the night in the dark and quiet admiring the universe and I would have the best time. Now, I can barely acknowledge that it's clear out, never mind actually take out my telescope and try to do anything with it. I just don't care anymore.   I want to care. But I can't. I can barely care about putting on clean clothes or even eating sometimes. I still ""care"" about getting up and going to work every day but that's because if I don't I'll be homeless.   What a wonderful life. Glad to be miserable 40 hours a week, a large percentage of my waking hours, so that I can have somewhere to live. Huray.   There's lots of shit I could be doing to try and improve myself. And I know what those things are, but every time I try, I get caught up in how much I'm not enjoying it and I fail. I just sink lower and hate myself more.   I'm only fucking 31 and I feel like I'm pretty much done here. Not much else I can do. The only thing I really wanted out of life was to have a family of my own. But that won't be happening.   I guess I just got so used to being disappointed that I stopped hoping that anything would ever work out. It's a nightmare. How can someone keep optimistic when they're just shit on constantly by life? That hopeful, eager outlook turns sour pretty fucking quick."

I don't even know what it is that I'm bummed I'm not doing, or what my goals and aspirations are.

And I honestly don't know how I feel about that.  I realized a year or so ago that I don't have any hopes anymore, and my dreams died around 2001 due to my own self-destruction.  I feel largely apathetic about it, but sometimes, sometimes, I see people my age (or younger) who have everything they've ever hoped for because they were able to take advantage of opportunities they had and environments that encouraged then to pursue what they were good at, not what their families thought would make them money in the future.

Although I have had no success with SSRis, I am also diagnosed with a personality disorder that is likely contributing to the Dysthymia.  I think it might be worth a shot trying a SSRI, or possibly a SNRI such as Cymbalta.  I have not had success, but I do know someone with dysthymia who has had success with SNRI medication.

depression,3e2qw5,shorttermsamourai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:10 2015 UTC,"That sounds rough, I'm sorry :/  It really sucks that you love acting but don't see it as very possible. Maybe there are other things you would enjoy, though. Perhaps not as much as acting, but enough to keep you wanting to keep going and stay alive--I think so. Maybe you have no idea what that might be. It's hard having no idea what to do in life. But maybe you could find something that you didn't know you liked or didn't even know existed--maybe you'll latch onto that and it will become your new dream and the loss of an acting career will still hurt but not quite so bad.  Personally, I (M, 20) have gone through a few career dreams only to realize that either A) they didn't fit me well or B) they just seemed unattainable. It hurts to give up a dream. It makes me wonder whether I'm not trying hard enough or if I'm giving up just to save myself from effort (No and no). Over time I've come to know myself a little better with each transition, and now I feel that I'm in a bit of a better place to seek a career that will be satisfying. One of the things that has taken a big place in my thinking is the idea that not only does the dreamlike, positive, ideal image of a potential career (or any experience, really)--not only does that matter, but also the nitty gritty pragmatic aspects of the job or of getting there matter. I think there's this toxic idea floating around that if you want something you should ""give it your all"" and make your whole life about that thing. Okay, maybe in some incredibly rare case. But me, I want to be relaxed and not fight tooth and nail for a dream that might be as idealized in my mind as the beauty standards you write about. So I'm slowly (slooooowly) coming to terms with the idea of ""settling"" for something ""less,"" of taking the easy road because it could actually be rather nice and there are plenty of people already competing on the hard road.  So this was pretty ranty and self-absorbed. Thanks for bearing with me. Maybe I'm using this post as an excuse for self-therapy. Sorry. I hope my experience can help you think through some things though. Definitely feel free to ask follow up questions or challenge anything I've written."

depression,3e22ki,DarftUnc,2,Tue Jul 21 10:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think I've found much more of use in books of philosophy than any doctor's office, though I do seem to neatly fit the criteria of a specific illness, and the lithium at least seems to help in a certain sense.  If you want to read about miserable people dealing with their miserable lives, but usually for existential problems, not physical, Russian literature is the place to look. Given the usual problems seen here, Oblomov might be especially relevant.  Tolstoy's Resurrection is a fun look at crime and punishment and futility. Given the context you might not get much from the rest of his work, but it's possible.  Something American, and slightly more recent, but probably more relevant for it, is Revolutionary Road. The wikipedia page seems to indicate why well enough.  You can look into the existentialist writers, most of whom wrote fiction and non-fiction, or in a million other places, but I think the last place I'd go to read about melancholic people is in a book with depression written on the cover."

Working at a gas-station in a drug infested part of town, there's a very real possibility of someone coming in, jacked up on something, and blowing me away for the $50 in the register. And sometimes, that thought doesn't bug me. But they're just moments, they pass. They're just clouds passing in front of the sun - just because they're blocking it out, doesn't mean the sun isn't still there. The clouds will pass. Every once in a while, a storm will come along, lasting days, weeks, months - but then things turn calm. Sometimes they remain that way, sometimes it's just the eye - and you get the unfortunate pleasure of going through it all over again. But everything passes. Every moment is followed by another, and that's something that'll help to focus on. Because like the storms, sometimes the sunlight sticks around for a few hours... days... weeks. It passes. This moment may suck, so you do whatever you can to ensure the next doesn't suck. Or, at least, suck a little less. Don't know if this helps, but I can relate. Hang in there. You're not alone."

My main goals are music, but it's not like I can just be a high payed musician easily, obviously. I also don't have friends, I live with my boyfriend's parents, because my parents push me too hard and don't even want to talk to me because I won't get help. But my boyfriend's parents are insane and my living environment is disgusting. I have a savings, but I've blown most of it, so now I can't move out. To answer your question about if I would kill myself in your position...I would feel the same way completely. I do feel that way now. I'm too scared of death to end it, but I'm so hopeless and so scared to get a job or see a therapist becasuse I don't think anything will solve these horrible feelings that I have, and that you share similarly. Lately all my hope has been lost, but I know I still have a tiny bit left, I don't know for what, but maybe years later something good will happen, maybe I will get help and it will work. I know these awful feelings will never go away, my depression will stay with me forever, but mabye I can find some way to push through it. It seems like something will drive me insane enough to apply to some shitty job and I'll get inspired somehow to write more music and put it out into the world. Everything horrifies me, but maybe something will happen... For you, I hope you have some hope left in you. It seems like you do because you have aspirations. You will find a drive to get to where you want to be, other people have done it, so you can too. Depression is taking over the things we love and wish to do, but if you have something you love, maybe do little things to get to your goal, take some online college classes, (i've heard online college is total bullshit and easy to get through). If you have these desires to do something, maybe you have some hope left? You can hang onto that. We're both still alive, I'm 20 years old, you're 22, I still feel like we're extremely young. I wonder what could happen in my life years from now. What if I ended up doing what I want to do? What if I did get help and it worked? Wondering what will happen kind of keeps me going. Thank you for sharing what you're going through, reading what people feel and think helps me feel like we're not alone and things could be different for us. Do you feel like you have any tiny bit of hope for yourself? or do you daydream about what will happen years to come? I feel like holding onto those feelings could get us through a bit more, maybe we will get some kind of random drive from being trapped in these situations that we will do something to further our wants and needs...idk... I really do believe in you though that you can be a programmer. You could use public transportation, try saving a little each month to move out. You're accomplishing a lot right now. You have a job and even though it may be awful you still go to it every day and push yourself even if you don't realize it. So that is A LOT. It shows you still have hope, IMO.

depression,3dxx9m,daaraa,9,Mon Jul 20 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"It's a cycle that rolls on, meticulously and endlessly adding a negative momentum. By now it should have crushed most people.  I think you must be strong to still be alive. I realize encouraging words at this point are meaningless. I understand that hearing about others who feel something similar to you fails to explain anything positive.  The thing people forget with depression is that it's a somatic disease; a sickness, causing all sorts of physical and mental changes. Forget about attitude; that is just a very small part of your situation. By now you probably have been falling so deep into the notion of your own that you probably can't see anything else.  I know it's hard to believe, especially from a stranger who warrants no safety, but as someone who recently took a ""break"" and came back to life; I implore you, life is worth living. But only when it is worth living. Does this make sense to you? Backwards, life not worth living, is not worth living.  This means you have to make life worth living. And I know you've tried to the best of your ability; you've done all in your power to remain objective and positive. Yet people still turn you away; and you too realize it's because of your sluggish response and lack of... whatever it is they have. To sum it up in one word, ""happiness"", just doesn't feel right; there's so much more missing to life than just mere happiness, right? Contentment, success, wonder, amazement, and so on... Things that are rare but shouldn't be.  If I have your attention by now, I'd like to in a short and constructive way say the most cliché thing; seek help. I do not mean this in a bad way. In fact I even made my own thread a while back ""how does one seek help?"" in frustration, about how everyone tells you to seek help and how that didn't work.  But happiness - and all of the attributes that entails - is not just chemicals in your brain. It's a momentum you build. Just like you've recessed into a shell of nothing, how you have built something negative, you can re-shape that and build your own positive momentum. For the first time, perhaps?  These are just words. It's easier said than done. Through my own process extending over a year of extensive help from society, it's been hell. I've hated a lot of those who helped me. Hated the system. But I am here on the other side of the process, and I am happy... as much as I can, anyway.  Sorry for the rambling. I hope you find some consolation in it.  Best regards..."
depression,3dxx9m,throwout5202015,4,Mon Jul 20 13:41:57 2015 UTC,"Hugs That's so much to deal with. I'm sorry. Maybe no one in your everyday says this because they're so used to what you do, but it's really brave to face medical problems like that. I know from my life with bipolar how it is to do the extra things, and accept what you have to, and get on with life as a person you can be proud of in spite of the challenges. I just admire your courage. And the heart you have to keep looking for friends like you should have---will have---despite your discouraging experiences.   I can relate to having an unhappy social life. I think I've said this sometime. I was bullied a lot in elementary school and middle school. Then in high school I was mostly an outcast. People made jokes about me and called me weird. The friends I did gain I chased away in manic episodes. Meanwhile I had an abusive parent... And now in grad school I still don't have any close friends except a couple from undergrad who live far away and whom I don't often talk to.   So ""I feel I don't belong anywhere"" too. And I also find that hard to change. I don't know what causes the trouble nowadays. Is it me or them or something else? I have some speculations. I'm diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, which makes things more difficult; but that diagnosis doesn't always seem to fit. I don't have special trouble approaching people and conversing.  Maybe it's my unpopular interests, the way I laugh at things other people don't find funny, that I'm depressed sometimes, or that I have my strange biography written on my mind and face?  I think a tough past can be isolating on its own. It's double bad that way. I think normal people just smell it on you and then unconsciously they stay away. I haven't experienced anything like the health challenges you describe. But I've had a strange and scary mental health odyssey. As a teen I was delusional, both paranoid and grandiose delusions. At times I really felt deep inside that I was the messiah, and for years I thought aliens were on earth and hunting me. And when that ended my bipolar one symptoms appeared... Though it's really sad to say, I think that all makes me different in a thousand subtle ways that turn people off. I know when I go to my bipolar support group it's like a weight is lifted off my shoulders just walking in the room. They understand and they aren't my adversaries. Maybe they're the people to be my friends.  Another issue is that everyone has their social life closed for some stupid reason. At this point it is what it is and it isn't changing. They'll hang with you at a cosplay convention or chat with you about your research all night but their social life is cemented around their SO, friends from earlier times, and maybe a neighbor or someone. I don't know how to go against this.   Anyways enough speculation about why it's so hard. For me it's all very confusing too, as it must be for you. Because though I don't have any friends, I'm sort of popular. People urge me to come to social functions and then when I show up they literally cheer at my entrance and can't get enough of the things I have to say. They've all seen me manic a couple times and loved that. But still none of it translates into real friendships. I hear about people on /r/bipolar coming out on facebook. If I made a post it would completely unnoticed.   I think the only solution with all the challenges is to keep trying and stay hopeful. You mention gonewildaudio and pillowtalkaudio in your post. I'm sorry those subs didn't treat you well. I stumbled on gwa when I was super depressed a few years ago. (I don't think pta existed yet.) It literally saved my life. The erotic aspect was almost incidental. Hearing voices was as comforting as being held or touched. I was also very lonely at that time. But then someone pm'd me, and before long we were best friends and fell in love. It didn't last forever, but the year meant so much to me... Just an example of how quickly and unexpectedly things can change. I really hope they do for you soon.   Anyway they should. If anyone deserves good friends online and off, you do.  And I hope you feel less sad too.

I've tried to be-friend my neighbors. our current neighbors and neighbors previously i asked if they wanted to hang out... gave them my number..they  never/have never called me. nor asked to hang out. i will never understand. without fb, twitter, tumblr or reddit.. i will be more secluded and distant from society. online is just not good for my health."

depression,3dz5ie,iPeeLavaLampGoo,3,Tue Jul 21 13:28:21 2015 UTC,"I apologize for how long this turned out to be. I really hope you decide to read it, but if you don't, then at least read this. ""Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day, or even a year. But eventually, it will subside, and something else will take its place. If I quit however, it will last forever. ""  It never seems like it when you're in a depression, but it will pass. Believe me. I'm in a similar place right now. It seems like it will just go on and on. But looking back at times in my life that were incredibly sad or depressing, I realize they are significantly less painful now than they were. It goes back to the typical response to these problems, ""Time heals all wounds."" It's true. We may never fully get rid of the pain associated with, say, a death or traumatizing experience, but the amount of pain and space it takes up in your mind becomes miniscule as time goes on. -- I think you should try and understand that you're not in a life or death situation. There is always a solution to your problem and suicide is not it. Suicide starts to seem like a solution when you can't see another solution or when other things you have tried haven't helped. Another typical, but true response to this is ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Suicide almost always goes this way: You are terribly depressed. You feel that you have no friends, your friends don't care about you, or your family doesn't care about you. You try medication, counseling, exercise, and none of it seems to work. The things that are supposed to help you through this time have either failed or seem to be closed off as an option. Now suicide comes to mind. And when a person actually takes their own life, it becomes apparent that the people they thought didn't care about them, in reality cared a great deal about them. Your friends and family either weren't aware you were so depressed or didn't understand how deeply it was affecting you. They may have been caught up in something in their own lives and thought you were just having a bad day and as a result, didn't look into it too much. It absolutely tears them up when you're gone because they weren't aware or didn't understand how serious it was and they know that if they had had just one conversation with you about how you were feeling, you'd still be here. And that's the horrible part about suicide. It is nothing but pain and sadness for every single person involved.   I understand you said you tried counseling, but it is really the number one thing that can help. It takes three things for it to work: 1) The right counselor. It's entirely possible you had a bad counselor. Or maybe they specialized in something else (children, couples, addictions). I just recently started counseling. I went to one guy who I just didn't quite click with. I didn't feel like he asked me enough questions or gave me enough advice. That was one session. I switched to a different counselor. One session with him and I came out feeling as though he cared about me and my situation and had given me invaluable advice on how to deal with my problems. Test the waters. See who else can help you. 2) You participating as much as they do. You can tell them anything. That's a hard one for me to grasp because I am very withholding about myself. You have to force yourself to tell them everything you see as a problem and everything that bothers you, from big life problems to a TV show that annoys you. Just tell them. The more information they have, the better they can help you. And it is just between you two. They are not going to text their friends about your problems.  3) You have to be active outside of a session in order to get better. Whatever advice or activity they suggest to you, you have to do. If they tell you to type or write your thoughts down, do it (this actually really helps). If they tell you to take a walk then take a walk. In short, both parties have to participate in order for you to shake the depression.   I would highly suggest trying to have a serious discussion with your family or a family member again. Make it as plain as day that you are severely depressed and need help and someone to talk to. Make sure they know about your suicide attempt and returning suicidal thoughts. If after that they still seem like they don't care, then you need to avoid them as best you can for awhile. But I think you will find that they truly care.  Again, I know from experience that everything everyone says to you when you are in a depression seems clichè. And as a result it doesn't seem genuine. But it most likely is genuine. And it's clichè because it's true. So, if you can, believe me when I say that it will get better. You are not broken or unfixable and you are not out of options. The number of people you think would be sad at you leaving their lives (and it is not anywhere close to zero) can most likely be multiplied by ten and still be an underestimate. This. Will. Pass. I sincerely hope you decide to stay with us. It may not seem like much coming from some text written by an internet stranger, but I mean that from the bottom of my heart."
depression,3dz5ie,iPeeLavaLampGoo,3,Mon Jul 20 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"I read all of that. Thank you for taking the time to reply in such a genuine manner. I will look in to switching counselors. But as far as my family is concerned, I think that's a lost cause, however I know my friends do care about me and would not want me to leave the world like this. But then again, my depression isn't spiking at the moment and as I'm sure you know, clarity doesn't last while depressed. But again, thank you so much. It doesn't matter if you're an Internet stranger, I believe you're being sincere."

Find something to look forward to. For me, I can't wait until I have my own kids one day. I want to be a mother SO bad. I have quite a few years until I'm in a stable enough position where I can, but it keeps me going. I just know I'm going to be an amazing mother so it gives me something to live for.   Think of something you REALLY want to do. It could be something you can do in an hour, a month, a year, 5 years...and use that to just keep pushing yourself. Take it one day at a time.

depression,3e1v8l,a_random_german_guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:55:42 2015 UTC,"Mahlzeit. Well, I'll add the positive view here, that you're at least still able to see that your situation isn't objectively bad. Which doesn't help much with your depression, obviously. My suggestion is that you don't wait until you spiral down further, but see a doctor about it. I ignored my seasonal winter depression for years until it had finally grown into an all-year problem, and after that I waited until I was hardly able to concentrate on my work.  If you were over the age of 35, I'd suggest to pack it onto one of those bi-yearly health check-ups, but the way things are, you'll need to just make an appointment. Mild depressions can be caused by a few physical/hormonal things, which a general doctor may want to rule out before sending you off anywhere else. Please don't break down when you hear the words depression and psychiatrist from your doctor's mouth. I'm not the person to promise moral support in hard times, but if you have any questions you'd like to ask in german, feel free to PM me."

I think about some in out-patient as well, they were heavy…  I hope they are still alive. Some people don't realize who traumatizing it is to be thrown in this situation and come out of it. You're no longer alone in it and you take those other people with you. It's unfortunate you were not able to trade information; I'd assume that'd especially be welcome for the youth."

Having a friend/date who has ""been there before"" is really valuable during the recovery process.  I'm sorry you've been depressed since losing contact with your hospital friends.

depression,3dwgru,EquiLiteral,6,Mon Jul 20 06:23:16 2015 UTC,I'm here with you.
depression,3dwgru,AN_HONEST_COMMENT,6,Mon Jul 20 04:52:26 2015 UTC,I wish I had wine but I am here. Lots of thoughts. Lots of regrets and confusion about the future. I wish I could sleep. I'm sorry about whatever is going on in your life. I'm in the boat with you.
depression,3dwgru,EquiLiteral,6,Mon Jul 20 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"I like this post. It is good to be reminded that we are not alone. It is raining in Southern California and I am using that to relax, think to myself, and fall asleep."
depression,3dwgru,AN_HONEST_COMMENT,6,Mon Jul 20 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not alone technically. My friend is in the other room sleeping, but I don't want to wake him up because he has work in 3 hours. I'm just here laying in bed, crying my eyes out for no reason. I just want food, especially cake, and cuddles to make me fall asleep somehow. Blah."
depression,3dwgru,Pixiepudding,2,Mon Jul 20 06:41:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when I feel really terrible, I want to talk to someone, to have someone hug me and tell me I'm going to be okay. I have friends in the next room, or family on the other side of the telephone, or whatever, but I never talk to them. There are a few friends I can talk to, more or less.   I have this dilemma: how open should I be with friends who don't know me as well, or who might not be as helpful? I suppose it would probably help more than hurt, but it's hard to bring it up...."
depression,3dwgru,slevadon,6,Mon Jul 20 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Joined reddit just to comment on this. Went to bed early, couldn't sleep. Went back through my fb and reminisced on what a miserable young person I was. Hello depression, didn't see you there"
depression,3dwgru,Scottex212,6,Mon Jul 20 07:11:18 2015 UTC,I texted people all over and still felt alone.  I had a friend tonight at a show in NYC texting me An ex in Arizona traveling An ex in Colombia traveling Another ex in Arizona An AA friend in North Carolina And an old friend in Indiana  and I still felt alone  It's becoming so much more clear recently that I had a very bad problem and need to  do whatever possible to change my mental well being.
depression,3dwgru,w4r10ck,4,Mon Jul 20 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when I feel especially lonely, I message a bunch of friends and have casual chats. It helps a little to feel like people are interested in me, but there's a big part of me that still feels alone.  I think the issue is this: when I share casual conversations, it's like I'm opening up only a part of myself to them, like opening the living room of a house but keeping all the other rooms out of sight. Maybe finding people I can talk to directly about my depression and anxiety--people I can invite into more of the house--maybe that would help me feel much less alone.  So that's just me venting. /u/AN_HONEST_COMMENT I hope you can figure out some steps to help. I know it can be really hard to seek help, but it can also be really worth it!"
depression,3dwgru,ruberbandbandaid,3,Mon Jul 20 20:15:08 2015 UTC,I've taken to just throwing my issues out there.  I told one friend immediately that I was coping with depression.  I've got problems and I'm tired of feeling alone in them.  I'm in crisis mode in my life looking for any way out so I'm trying things I've never tried before.  I can't keep living like this.  This moment in my life is crucial and critical to the future strengthening of my well-being.
depression,3dwgru,NAWilliams92,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:15 2015 UTC,"Your openness inspires me to be more open with my friends. I think at least some of them would be really supportive.  I think in one sense it's great that you seem so motivated to grow healthier. Sometimes I know what could help but I just don't have the motivation to do it. But I suppose the flip side is that sometimes I get really anxious about whether I'm trying hard enough to improve, and the anxiety makes me less productive/healthy."
depression,3dwgru,queereggs,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:27 2015 UTC,"Motivation is a struggle for me too.  I spent the last 5 days a hermit, binging on movies, and skipping gym days.  I honestly just have to force myself some days.  But if I force myself to go for a few days in a row, I do build a momentum to keep going.  But opening up has been a surprise of a reaction.  I find people tend to be very supportive.  I even made a Facebook status about my depression and anxiety and was overwhelmed by the response.  I think it really resonates with a lot of people because underneath our veneers of self, we're all struggling with something.  I'm just the guy not afraid to say that I feel alone and down.  And I'm only doing that because I'm desperate to break the cycle; I need a breaking point in my life now (and I don't currently have money to seek therapy or prescriptions).    Look into my post history; I'm trying anything and everything to change."
depression,3dwgru,peartrans,6,Mon Jul 20 23:30:14 2015 UTC,I'm having a very hard time. Trying to make it through my overnight shift. Calling a psychiatrist and a therapist in the morning to make appointments because I can't keep going on the way I have been.
depression,3dwgru,peartrans,5,Mon Jul 20 05:50:43 2015 UTC,Got some rum and weed. But im only postponing the pain

depression,3dwgru,peartrans,5,Mon Jul 20 07:21:03 2015 UTC,Another sleepless night and 3am thoughts of regret. Cheers OP and all the wonderful company wherever you may be.
depression,3dwgru,watchoutacat,5,Mon Jul 20 07:47:01 2015 UTC,"Physically alone, but all of us are emotionally connected.  As someone else mentioned, it's so hard to think that there are so many of us that suffer chronic mental illnesses such as clinical depression, and yet we all feel alone."
depression,3dwgru,4702four11,6,Mon Jul 20 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"Cheers! I have recently eliminated most of my friends in an attempt to improve myself. Before, whenever I'd need a distraction I would drive to a friends house to waste time and escape (and I began to realize I hang out with these people not out of genuine interest, only escape). Now I'm completely alone (minus family) with my thoughts. I have nowhere to escape. Surprising that I'm not so scared but relieved. I've spent the last decade escaping from all of my problems with friends and drugs.  So, not exactly on topic. Just thought I'd give my present take on aloneness. So, cheers to being alone."
depression,3dwgru,Sheeyouu,8,Mon Jul 20 09:41:58 2015 UTC,I would have some alcohol but that's whats causing this shitty night tonight. Also the fact that I'm bored and sick doesn't make it better.
depression,3dwgru,Kozakysaki87,7,Mon Jul 20 02:54:12 2015 UTC,"I said no to making myself feel ""better"" with drugs or self harm, and decided that wine and music was a better choice."
depression,3dwgru,Lotacus,4,Mon Jul 20 03:06:37 2015 UTC,Well whatever works for you.
depression,3dwgru,joydivides,5,Mon Jul 20 03:22:15 2015 UTC,I have had some pretty shitty nights because of alcohol.
depression,3dwgru,GolldenFalcon,5,Mon Jul 20 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"same. lost the love of my life, a five year relationship, two weeks ago because i just couldn't stop drinking...  now that ive sobered up ive realized what i threw away... worst pain ever"
depression,3dwgru,DymondHed,6,Mon Jul 20 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"Me and my S.O, a couple months ago, started going to therapy and na/aa type meetings called celebration to which she has put down the bottle to after realizing how much destruction (being she never acknowledged before the holes in every wall, and bruises on me from flying objects) it brought to our existing ailments. I'm no angel either but I'm also a self destructive person, not the projecting type, and I'm so happy I stuck through it all until that one day she saw and heard. It takes a special person to give that type of encouragement to help fix a tiny part of a person's problems(not tooting my own horn here) but the love of your life should have and could have found alternate routes to handling your issue with drinking. That is unless you refused all alternatives or help and even then there are ways to not lose people over it if they have similar (love of their life) emotions towards you. Because for us, it basically came down to you and i are getting help with this together otherwise we will never succeed in our relationship... similar to you in a way... and she was totally down for it. I think it clicked with her because I put myself in her shoes with her, as I have suffered addiction and self medication and held her hand through it and got treatment for it myself with her. I'm sorry it took a downward spiral, but in the end, although you loved him, maybe he wasn't strong enough to support you.      Because the fiercest lovers are always the fiercest fighters, good and bad.  (Background time) We have been together 5.5 yrs and in that time.... basically her life went from normal, tightnit family (her being the middle of 5 kids) when I met her, to divorce, to older brothers abandoning the family situations and having no contact, younger siblings going on God trips and no path, to getting rufied and raped, to her mom moving under a bridge in downtown Houston smoking meth eventually landing her in jail for 6 months, to us taking over all the finances of the house to extend the inevitable foreclosure in case she got back on her feet or her dad (who is her stepdad, as her real dad she never met because he comitted suicide soon after she was born) decided to step back in, to her mom and her methhead boyfriend moving back in and trashing the place with rocks ""that have faces carved by native americans from prehistorica"" and dogshit, to losing their family home and her childhood belongings to foreclosure and her families inability to rally and get their shit out, to identity theft leaving her in tons of debt... on top of other issues. And this is all along with myyy issues (all of which happened in a 3 year span of our relationship)of 2 of my best friends (which I only have/ had 4 real friends) overdosing and dying, father getting cancer and dying 3 yrs later, to my brother going to jail for 12 years over attempted murder, leaving me with an enormous burden of caring for and supporting my mother with the family trust which is spread all over the state and all over the country left up in escroe, as he died before signing his finalized will, to.... I'll keep my list short as it is far too long to keep this shit up and you probably get the mesage.     Basically depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders are a fuckin bitch on top of laundry lists of this sort. It is easy to drown out the shit in your life with substances but it never takes into account the person you are in a relationship with because that's who you are usually most comfortable doing it around. And even though we have both gone through all this shit within the time of our relationship, not to mention previous issues, we have stood together through it all and neither one of us would give up on the other because of unforseen triggers and our coping mechanisms.   All in all I'm proud of you sobering up, and I know it's corny to say there's other fish in the sea, but relationships and true love affairs don't fault one another over moments of weakness and lapses in judgement. I believe you are a strong willed woman who needs a stronger man that can manage and love you at your highest and lowest. So don't beat yourself up over it too bad. You succeeded in sobriety, even if it is only temporary (Fyi we aren't full fledged into the 12 step program, we mostly just listen to speakers to keep things into perspective, and I think that helps better than anything)  Hope I didn't wander too far with this... it at least felt good to get it off my chest randomly to a bunch of strangers....  G'night stranger. You are worth every breath you breathe. Even though you did nothing but comment something random, you impacted my life in a way I am truly grateful for."

I've got the Doritos, I've got the Kit Kats, I've got the ginger ale, I've got the custard, I've got the pop tarts. Game my fucking brains out because I haven't in forever.   Day Two, Saturday: Recover sleep from day one. Maybe game, but mostly catch up on sleep. Watch a movie and work out if I feel like it.  Day Three, Sunday: Long bike ride. Get a neat lunch. Not allowed to come back for at least three hours. Take pictures. Come home, shower, movie, sleep.   Rest of the week: Relax. Blast music.  Maybe try writing. Go for walks. Me day all week. Clean too, I haven't done a deep clean in a long while.  I was going to write out everyday but it would be repetitive.   Anyways, do what you want, be productive, most of all relax.  Toodles."

I was diagnosed with extreme anxiety and depression, brought on by a number of different stressors.  Don't take this as a diagnosis, but I can say I've seen people with PTSD react similarly when reliving old memories.  Shortness of breath, pain the chest, dizziness or the like are all signs of anxiety.  It's not fun, but it is okay to feel that way."

depression,3e1o10,LegalxDrug,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:34 2015 UTC,"Hey Joe. Depression is one mean son of a bitch.  When it's got us, it makes us feel like we've got no one.  It makes us feel like it's wrong to be like that, or feel that way, or be that way.  If you do decide to talk to a doctor or something like that, it will be a comfort to know that a psychologist doesn't prescribe you medicine for you.  The psychologist is there to talk to you, to support you, and to offer strategies to deal with this pain.  I gotta ask, how has your sleep been lately?"

I know thats the psychologist job to talk to me and be there for me but i don't even express myself with my parents, i can't even say to my mom i feel sad or anything i just act normal, i put my sleepy face everyday like always and the look at me like its normal to them."

One of the most difficult things you can do is open up, and it's only made harder every time you do it and someone doesn't listen, or worse, doesn't care.  but most of the time people just don't know how to react.  There's a big negative stigma about mental illness.  Telling a person is like bleeding at first.  I started with my room mate at the time.  Then I told the next person, another friend that I trusted.  Every now and then I made it a point to tell my story.  It gets a little easier each time, and people are usually more understanding if they know."

I'm assuming ur planning on having some sort of health insurance. Does this plan offer any help for mental illnesses, like therapy or medication?

I can assure you that you wouldn't get fired over having a moment, it happens to a lot of people. It's very possible that your boss sent you home early in case something happened and he didn't want to instigate or interrogate.

Translating your thoughts into words and then just burning them away can be really therapeutic.   Take life one day at a time, and as insanely impossible it can be, try to focus on every little achievement you make. Even if it's simple as a genuine laugh at a picture online or a joke you overhear, it's a moment of happiness and a break from the gloom.  If you want to talk about anything you can message me, I hope what I said helps you feel a little better, even if it's just for a second."

It probably won't be the last time, but people are often more understanding than we give them credit for, even its just in a general ""they must be going through a hard time""  kind of way.   Talk to your boss, I guarantee this isn't the worst, weirdest, or difficult thing they've dealt with. In fact? They've probably had a cryer before. It will be fine.   Good luck."

depression,3dybog,matchy_blacks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:57 2015 UTC,Is your new boss aware of your (I'm assuming) pre-existing mental health condition? I very much doubt you'll get fired over that but I'm not an expert. I think the best thing to do would be to explain what happened and why you reacted the way you did. A lot of employers once they are made aware of things such as this are obliged to make reasonable adjustments for you.

I don't know if that's consolation or not, but most bosses aren't totally inhuman!    As other commenters have already said, let your boss know about your depression and ask if there are any resources for employees with mental health issues at your workplace that you might not know about.  Good luck!"

If I had an employee break down and cry the first day I would wonder if that employee could pull themselves up and try and fight the depression.  Office jobs are soul sucking, but they also have HR and some backbone of help with employees. As long as you're not a construction worker or a lumberjack I think your crew might understand that.  Also, as an side, I don't know if this will make you feel better but the first day of my current job I had a huge seizure and (of course) peed / crapped myself and broke off my left front tooth. The next day I went people were acting awkwardly around me and I just went straigh to the point and continued on. Every person has ""those things"". For me it's epilepsy, for you it may be debilitating anxiety, for another maybe they suffered PTSD from a war."

Also if you look at relationships from an evolutionary perspective people meet, fall in love and have kids. What if you never have kids? your just stuck with an infertile partner? nada your emotions and feeligns are going to start to backtrack to get you to break up so you can find someone new to have kids with. If you don't want kids and you don't want to breakup you can try getting a dog, it will at least give you something to be responsible for and take care of.

I'm actually infertile myself anyway (not that I really care) so any relationship isn't gonna involve kids unless he adopt or something, we both know that. We don't live together yet so the dog is sadly out of the question. I don't think it would be the best idea yet anyway, I can barely look after myself.   And I've been thinking of seeing someone, I went on ssris once but stopped because I didn't wanna be drugged up, plus they gave me random nosebleeds on the month I was on them which my doctor said was unrelated.

You will still like figuring things out and you'll still be funny. Your personality and interests will remain largely the same. Like pretty much 100% the same. But, because your point of view has changed, what you find funny or interesting might be different than what interests you now. And, because of that, if you're young, you might change your peer group a little bit over it.  Depression and nearly all mental illness is physical. And, the more you research it the more confident you'll become that this is the case. And, the more you'll learn that what governs you feeling good  does not actually govern what you feel good about. That's a whole other part of the brain.   You like to figure stuff out. This will come in handy as there's a ton of pop BS regarding mental illness and depression. This is  kinda like ""welcome to a new project"". And, navigating the world of mental illness really is much easier when looked at that way.   So, lucky you.    But, yeah, I was afraid of that, especially when I was younger. I put off medication and treating myself right for years. I wasted a ton of time and ruined like a billion opportunities in all areas of my life because of it. My most sincere and best advice is ""Find the therapies and medications that work for you ASAP"" Like make it your mission.   I wasted years regarding this sort of thing. Don't be like me. Get good help.  Don't listen to people who don't want you to get help or take pills. These people, no matter how well intentioned, are not your friends, in this moment. What's most important is that you feel good enough to live the life you think is worth living. You deserve it."

That in of itself will give you satisfaction, having the mental will to make a decision and stick to it. I too have used drugs (cannabis and lsd) to escape reality, and while that works temporarily, it's not a permanent fix. Heroine is a whole other ball game, and I'm afraid to say I'm not totally sure how it makes you feel or how it works because I've never done it, but it can turn into a nasty habit.  It does seem however that you learned a lot from using, about how to function like a ""real"" person as you say. I suppose my advice would be try to capture those feelings without using. The satisfaction of being sharp, going out to play basketball, lifting, talking to girls, eating right didn't come from using, but from within yourself. Maybe heroine allowed you to find it, but now that you know it's there, try to capture those feelings without using. I recommend trying to do the same things you were doing, just without heroine. I think it'll lead to a more satisfactory life, and you'll gain more skills in social situations."

However I am going to tell you - due to smack being really sketchy - to try some milder ""opium""-like substance. Kratom is one which you may look into, and if you're in the US, you're even more lucky because it's legal.   I do think that drugs can be a helping hand to get oneself out of a rat hole, but they shouldn't be helping you all the time.

Self-improvement is a long-term investment of willpower that I never gave myself credit for. Heroin takes that individual mindset and shows you a simulation of what it could be if you never accepted a demon's loan, more than all credit can pay back. and it fucks your brains out while you're holding its hand in a simulation running your life like kevin spacey played the house of cards.  My head is a bit clearer I still want to get high more than anything, which finally seems disgusting to my dignity so I threw away the bags and the garbage guy should come this morning thank God.

My family wasn't strictly religious, but my mother did expect me to go to church every Sunday. My dad really didn't care what I did religiously, as long as I got my shit done at school and passed (which I did, eventually, a day late and a dollar short). My dad was actually the strict one; I'm an army brat, if that means anything to you. Up until I was 18, I constantly heard ""Until you're old enough to move out, I'm not your friend - I'm your father"". He was strict, but in a lot more ways he was fair. I guess I kind of got lucky with my parents. But what I'm wondering is - because this is where I'm having trouble relating, but - can you refuse the medication? Or, at least talk to your doctor before he prescribes it and see if he can't seek an alternative method? Tell your doctor how you feel about the medication, and be honest. As for living at home - it's a shitty situation, but one thing you can do is, whatever money you happen to get, stash it aside. Hide it if you have to. Start saving up for a place of your own, and whenever you're old enough to move out - make that your birthday present to yourself. Even if it doesn't happen exactly on your birthday. You're in a very toxic environment, but once you remove  yourself from it, you start improving. Don't know if this helps, but I hope it does at least a little."

Now I live in Houston so there's lots of hospitals there and since I don't have health insurance I guarantee my experience was worse than others. I had to go to a hospital for broke folks. I was in for about three days... Had to do group therapy, ate terrible food, got my vitals taken like every hour, saw a social worker, a psychiatrist and a nurse multiple times per day. They block all of the things you can use to communicate with people on the internet so no Facebook, email, etc. definitely no cell phones. Bring a change of clothes cause they won't have anything for you to wear. It was freezing, boring as hell and all they did was up my dose of one of my medications and prescribed a prescription to me that costs about $300 a month. It was kinda pointless? I should have just called my psychiatrist. However, if you have health insurance you can go somewhere that'll give you better care I'm sure. If you're afraid that you'll hurt yourself then it's definitely something you need to do though. Best of luck my friend.!"
depression,3e015p,Handpuppe,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's the same thing but many people here experience Apathy ,which is feeling little to no emotion and feeling little to no desire to do things and also nothing being pleasurable  I used to play video games for hours  , used to be my escape from the real world. I used to binge-watch Netflix series for the same reason ,I was actually rather engaged in them. Now I try to play a game ,launch it and after 10 minutes I just can't be bothered , it feels like a chore. The only way I can watch TV series now if I put a split window ( half screen) with the show playing in the right and browsing something in the left(usually reddit), and the only reason that I do this is because I feel less lonely doing so ,having a sort of ""background noise"" (I can't stand tv due to advertisments).  Now that my default , I get some lucky times when I can actually get engaged into a game and play it for a rather long time  , but if I'd have to say that would only consist in 2/3 months in a year."

Feel free to talk about any of your worries I will not judge, if you don't feel like saying it in public I understand :)  Have you tried counselling or seeing a psychologist? If that's too expensive there are free hotlines to call and also free online counselling websites. I'm not sure which country you are from otherwise I'd find them and put them in a link for you.   I've been in a big rut lately, have been watching telly all day everyday, I dropped out of year 11 in March. And yesterday I decided it was time to stop being like this, I found some motivation and today I got up and went on a two hour walk up the hills near my house. Id recommend finding something like that to do to keep you busy when you're feeling down. Start a new hobby or something.  Only you can bring yourself out of it, and I hope you're okay :)"
depression,3dxt69,AstulzerRZD,6,Mon Jul 20 12:30:04 2015 UTC,"For me it's all about springing into action as soon as I wake up. Gotta keep that tempo up; build a momentum for the day. But it's different for everyone.  Of course it comes and goes in waves. I think in general sleep is very important and should not be neglected. I understand it's not always a choice - whether to sleep or not - but there are always ways to improve your sleep.  If you don't know how, I suggest reading about it. I.e. if you're still awake 20 minutes after an attempt of sleep, go back up and do something for a while; not only will it re-condition your brain but also give you deeper sleep once you do, giving you more energy than you would get from remaining in bed.  Another known trick in the book is to dedicate a sole room for your bed; no computer, no mobile use, nothing except sleep. All of us don't have that space or luxury though; but if you do, I highly recommend it."

I beg to differ... some of the greatest writers are pessimists. People (intelligent ones anyway) read to feel things and analyze existence, not to feel all bubbly about the world. Comedians are often the same way. A TON of comedians have depression and use humour as a coping mechanism and to relate to people.  You are intelligent and analytical. You see the world as it is.  Sorry I can't help you more with finding online friends, when I was growing up chatrooms and forums were way bigger things, with social media you're pretty much restricted to interacting with people you know. Chatrooms do still exist though, try searching for one about something you're into and the conversation will go elsewhere and if you ""show up"" often enough at regular times you'll probably make some friends."

I went up, grabbed my guitar, the curtains parted.  There I was. Alone. 300+ strangers. First time in public.  Damn near shat myself.   My left leg started uncontrollably wobbling back and forth like a cramp.  So I breathed deeply and played on purpose 6 horrible, out of tune notes with no distortion.  You could actually hear the disappointment in the audience, they thought I was going to just suck for 5 minutes straight. Then I clicked on my distortion, and put my still wobbling leg on the wah pedal I brought, and did a huge pick slide with tons of delay.  The amount of wobbling in my leg made my wah really rapid fire, and honestly I would have hated the tone now that Im more experienced, but it sounded awesome to my naive ears. I played some really basic licks, threw in some tapping. The crowd loved it, and I would have earned 2nd place if it wasn't for a huge donation to #3 from her parents which kicked me to #3.  I was by no means good, but I left many with the impression that I was.  I do this trick all the time and I recomend it.

I used to get sick when I was a kid if I ate too much MSG containing chinese food but luckily alcohol fixes that now for me.  If its just depession/anxiety and ADD type symptoms you are dealing with you are better off with an SSRI like zoloft in my opinion. D-serine might be worth adding as well for 15$. Also a stimulant I like to take that doesn't have a crash is provigil."

I have tried Zoloft and several other antidepressants, which made me feel angry and very upset and also lots of anhedonia. It was strange. Hence trying out the Lamictal. I do not think I am bipolar, however. Sorry for sounding like a crazy self absorbed nutcase."

depression,3dyoyf,richb222b,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"You should be proud of being in therapy for twelve months. Even if it feels like a small accomplishment, or hardly one at all, in the grand scheme of things, being proud of 'small' things is important too.   I've never been to therapy before but I do sometimes encourage myself (simple stuff like ""I can do this!"", ""I'm powerful!""), out loud or just in my head.   While I don't do it regularly partly because of it feeling silly, the silly feeling of it also makes me feel slightly..happy or something analogous. I wouldn't want to be caught doing it by virtually any other person on the planet!, but I think we can all use some silliness in our lives. There's so much seriousness in the world. You don't always need to be not-silly."
depression,3dyoyf,Phynicks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:10 2015 UTC,It never worked for me. It just felt ridiculous and like I was lying to myself. I read a study once that said for some people positive self talk can actually make them more depressed. That pretty much sums up how it worked for me. More power to the people it does good for but I know I am not one of them.
depression,3dyoyf,SolitaryOrchid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"Positive self-talk only helps me when I believe it - and when I am depressed is when I am least convinced of my capabilities or redeeming qualities. On the days when I am feeling buoyed or hopeful about things, the little ""I've got this!"" cheer does help. But getting to those days is a struggle. Building up the body of evidence that can substantiate the positive self-talk is also hard, because I just don't believe in myself in the depths of depression. Having someone else tell me of my positive aspects brings out mixed reactions in me, and it is also based on whether I believe in what they are saying or whether I think they are sincere in saying it.  I do think it is important to acknowledge when we have made progress in the right direction and I'm trying to do this for myself.  Congratulations on sticking with therapy - it is a long journey and kudos to you for not giving up. Let's not give up."

We really need to have friends in our daily life in order to maintain a healthy self-image and mental health. It's even easy to be alone as long as you know you have people waiting for you at the end of the road. But sometimes we lose this hope, and that sounds like what has happened to you.  Depression sucks, its like a choking blanket. The only thing that helps me most of the time is music, humor, or friends. Try to find some people that you can talk to you and get some help if possible, depression is very real. I hope you can find some help brother."

I've been dating a lot and while there's nice guys out there, they're just not what I want.  I never thought I'd have to settle for somebody, but every date I go on makes me feel like that's the inevitability.  I had that somebody.  I had that perfect person.

And yea you have to control it everything that is too much is bad for your health. 2-3 times  a week little smoke session would do more help than the harm. Well its about your attitude. I felt very sad too before I started going to gym. Than I made some friends there. And now its like our hanging out place we come do our stuff and we  chill, laugh a little its great. Try going with few friends together its always better and you have to got some kind of goal. And consistency for going long period. Example my goal is to get six pack and motivation for going is like I can't miss any they because it's like religious thing like going to the church every Sunday.

depression,3dys76,Keninishna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:35 2015 UTC,"Ask him if he's depressed. No, actually, that's what I would say if he hadn't asked about a psychiatrist. Since he did?  Take him to the psychiatrist. Tell the GP that he wants a psychiatrist because he isn't sure if life is worth living, and all medical staff will see that it's serious enough to warrant treatment.  Right now you seem a lot like that specialist who treated him like a child and talked down to him. I'm sure you're coming from a place of love and want to protect him, but stop treating your brother like he's incompetent and can't speak for himself. He's told you how he feels and what he wants, he is definitely depressed, and you should care more about HIS opinions than those of random people on the internet.  Just listen to him. Being taken seriously and treated with respect would probably make a world of difference to his mental state.  And while I'm sure your mother was worried and scared, she definitely should have taken him to a doctor after the first note. But there's nothing you can do about that now, so just take him as soon as you can, because it's much better late than never."

Changing people's minds is usually really hard, so all I can suggest is not focusing on/caring about their opinions, or trying to work things out rationally (which can be hard or impossible).  I like anime too, at least. I understand why some people think it has a bad rap, it's the same as how they think modern art is a waste of time. They're wrong, but allowed to be wrong.

I started out just doing the medical science component and managed to score a transfer so I know the pressure of maintaining a good average mark. My first question to you is: do you actually want to study medicine, or is it something that others have imposed on you? If you could choose to be anything in the world, what would it be?   Everyone's allowed to have a bad semester or two, especially if you're struggling personally. Just recognise the factors that led to this point and try to address those."

depression,3dzw8h,SilentMindNumbSoul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"For me, I had to do some serious discussion with my therapist about why I was self harming and I learned there were two big causes for most times. In most cases I was either experiencing extreme emotions I didn't know how to deal with or was using it as a coping skill so I wouldn't commit suicide. Sometimes I just get triggered by seeing a razor and there's not a lot I can do about that one but before I learned why I was doing it for the other reasons I really couldn't work toward stopping. The whole ""just don't do it"" never worked for me. I really needed to get to the root of the problem to make any progress. While I have slipped back into it, I did manage to go a year without cutting by working on the roots.  If you think telling other people will be harmful to you I would recommend not doing it. The only reason I would say to tell someone else about it is if you think something good will come from it. Like if you're feeling awful and guilty about keeping quiet and telling someone will help you or something like that. But if nothing good can come of it I see no reason why you would need to tell anyone else (besides your therapist, lots of good can potentially come from that)."

depression,3e0kdq,interstate-15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, depression is a spectrum. From light, to mild, to extreme. One of my own depression-management tactics is, when I'm going through something, gauge it - is this a small issue I can deal with myself? Then I got this. Is it mild? Well, then maybe I should find a friend to talk to about it. Is it extreme? Then that's when it's good to have a large support group. It's good that you have a support group, but find out who, within that group, helps you the most. Use them the most, if they don't mind, and you can trust them. They're the one you want when things are borderline - not too bad, but potentially could get worse. And I can relate to the feeling of constantly fighting the same battle. My form of depression is 'clinical-depression', meaning I've suffered from it for as long as I can remember, and I'll probably be suffering it for the rest of my life. So I find myself constantly fighting battles I've fought before, and it's stressful, that feeling of 'I've been here before and never wanted to return. Yet here I am'. All I can really suggest is to keep going, keep fighting, and never giving up. Can't say the battles get any easier, but take comfort in the fact that they're familiar. You've been down this road before, so you have a good chance of knowing where it may end up. And if doesn't - go to that friend, or group of friends when you need them. Hope this helps a bit."

Your depression is unique to you, but that's not a bad thing. Find people who you can relate to, and talk to them. Like here, at /r/depression. Lurk for a bit, read other comments.

depression,3dvvep,papaver,121,Sun Jul 19 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"You and me, I think we're the exact fucking same.  I have an hour long commute. I have to wake up at 5 am, leave at 6 am, and be in by 7. I leave at 3 pm, and make it home at 4. I have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing.  The instant I get home at 4:30 pm, my mind goes into timer mode. I start counting the hours, the minutes, sometimes even the seconds. I have exactly four and a half hours to do things I want to do before I have to go back to the slog the next day. I need to cram that time with as much of the things I want to do as possible.  My weekends are the same. I wake up, and I start counting. Saturdays are less of a problem usually because I can wake up when I want and go to sleep whenever I want, but it's still there casting a shadow over everything. I get one day. One day out of seven where I don't feel stressed about waking up when I have to and sleeping when I have to. And when Saturday starts, I have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before Sunday. When Sunday starts, I have until 9 pm until my weekend is over.  When the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me, you start feeling stifled for time, and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless, because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back.   This is your life, ending one hour, one minute, one second at a time, for forty hours a week. Maybe even more.  If anyone asks you out, whether it's your SO or your friends, your parents, anyone, even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy, your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation. How much of my time will this take? How much will I have left until I have to go back to work? And when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store, if there's traffic, if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time, you start to resent it. You resent that delay, and the people who caused that delay, for wasting the precious free time you have, and every hour, every minute, every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do.  Things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment, because you can't stop that clock. You can't stop counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds. Even if you're enjoying yourself, even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot, even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream, that shadow is there, telling you that you only have this many hours, this many minutes, this many seconds left until you go back. Like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck. And when you're having fun, that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world.  Hey, fucker. Have a good time? I hope you did, because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back. Now start lifting, jackass. Your life doesn't become yours until we say it does.  My job doesn't suck. The work is nothing special, if a little tiring, but it's not murdering me. I work at a good company, my co workers are good people, my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can. My pay isn't anything stellar but it's liveable, and some people would envy having it ($20 an hour).   But I get the sense that I'd feel like this with the vast majority of work. Forty hour work weeks, no matter what, get tedious, become meaningless, burn me out. The only way I can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that I love. But how many people get jobs they love? How many people get paid liveable wages, enough to have a room and food, doing what they love? How many people even know what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place?  The fact that the starving artist is a running joke in America--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality. And the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else, even fake laughter, is the cruelest reality imaginable.  You want to do what you love? Fuck you. That's not how the real fucking world works, shitheel. Now hop to it, you've got forty hours of work to do, and if you want to fucking eat, you better fucking do it.  I'm reminded of that movie In Time, starring Justin Timberlake. It's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning, and people trade time. A coffee might cost thirty seconds, a cab fare might cost two minutes, a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months, a new sedan might be nine years.  There's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have, and when the number reaches zero, they die. Some people have hundreds of years of time. Some people live minute to minute.  That's what I feel like. That some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to, with their 90 years of time, and here I am, scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and I die.   And in America, you can't talk to anyone about it. Nobody at all. Not really. Because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you, society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others. All because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week, one hundred and sixty hours a month, one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck. And you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck, that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills. You try, you try so hard to justify it. You need this money. You need to give up these forty hours to live. This is necessary. You try.  But it doesn't work. Not really. Not until it's too late.  I've been trying to search for a job where I can work from a home office. But for someone like me, there's no options. Everything requires more schooling, more experience, and getting schooling or experience requires time and money I don't have and can't get. And even then, I've only been at this job for a few months. I can't quit yet because I need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume.  I know drugs will make it worse. Alcohol will make it worse. The most I can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that I used to like, activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose. I used to enjoy these things, but now the most these things can give me--these things I used to love and enjoy--is a distraction. A temporary illusion that I'm not miserable, which wears off at 9 pm every day.  There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I can only hope that it's a train."

I want to work, pay off all my debts, live small with as little as possible, and invest all the money I don't spend in an index or mutual fund. Then retire as soon as possible so I can actually start fucking living. I wanna fly to another country and be homeless for a while. Or climb a mountain, or backpack across a country. I wanna do something that isn't sitting on my ass being another pointless gear in a pointless machine.   Fuck everything about this lifestyle we've created. If I could work 5 hours a day with little vacation, or 8 hour workdays with 1 month vacation (like in European countries) maybe working would actually be worth it.

depression,3dvvep,Fayeliure,11,Mon Jul 20 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat, no matter how much a job pays, if it feels it isn't worth it, it isn't. The pay is not worth the damage it does to you. I'd like to tell you, so you can further understand that there are others who endure the same hell, day in and day out, 40 hours a week. For me, it's at minimum wage. I am currently seeking another job, but until then, I'm stuck at this one.  I work in customer service at a gas-station. Between two companies, I've been doing this for almost a decade. I have 40 hours scheduled, hours I'm given suck. Take this week I'm currently working -  Sat - 6a-2.5p Sun - 9a-4.5p Mon - 9a-4p Tues - 10p-6am Wed -10p-6am Thurs/Fri off.  An hour shy of the 40, but because I've already been having trouble sleeping this last week, it's the two over-nights that I'm truly dreading. Because of the area I'm working in, those two nights will be spent split between my duties, and keeping tabs on the heroine addicts that hang out in the general vicinity of my station.  This is a job I hate. I've had a lot of interesting experiences throughout these years, and some very scary situations. Some examples of what I've gone through, just trying to do my job.  One night at my old station (company I worked for before this current one), I was getting ready to break down my register and go home. I was working the closing shift, so it was getting close to 2am. Doorbell chimes, and I look up - straight into the barrel of a gun. I was lucky - all he wanted was the money, so as soon as I handed it over, he was gone. That stayed with me for quite some time.  Several weeks ago, at the station I'm working at, we had a small car-fire out at one of our pumps. When I looked outside, all I could see was smoke. I freaked - but my immediate thought was 'No way I'm dying here, not for this company, not for this shitty pay'. So I hit the 'all-stop' button (turning off all the gas-pumps), grabbed the fire extinguisher, and did what I had to do. That was quite stressful.  Something that happens to me practically everyday at work stems from a policy my company has in place - everyone gets ID'ed for tobacco/alcohol, regardless of age or frequency of visits (we're a bit of a corner store for a lot of people, so we see some people multiple times a day). That was two years ago - and to this day, I still have people coming in and getting blatantly hostile with me over one simple question; ""May I see your ID?"". Because of that one damn question, I've been told to fuck off and die, I've been called a fascist asshole, I've been called a skinny little faggot, I've been told I'm going to be hunted down and murdered, and I've been told that people like me are soulless assholes.  And all I'm thinking here is, ""I'm just trying to do my job"". I hate it. I absolutely hate it. When I was at my worst, I'd get home and drink like a fish. I wasn't happy until I finished a 6-pack myself.  And I'm still stuck there. But I don't intend to be stuck there forever. Now, I mentioned I worked for two companies - I did manage to get out of that hostile environment, and into a -very- good paying government job. I ended up walking away from that job (for a lot of reasons), regardless of the fact that it paid well, and ended up back at a gas-station. Every day is SSDD; Same Shit, Different Day. Everyday. I lose track of what day it is, what week it is, much like you do! And it's hell. But I've finally reached a point where I'm done taking it.  I'd suggest you consider what I'm doing as an option for yourself - while you're working this job, when you do get home, do yourself a favor and start looking for another one. They're out there, all you have to do is look. There are websites dedicated to just that alone, for various lines of employment. Put together a resume, because that right there gives you a chance to put down your best attributes and personal strengths - right there, on paper, for you to actually visualize. Then go out there, get some job interviews lined up, and give it your all! Because you're worth more than the 40-hour-grindstone! We all are! I hope this helps, even if in some small way."

I'd have to be bed at 8pm, to wake up at 5am every day. By the time I got home, I'd be so drained that I would just sit at my computer eat dinner, watch an episode of something.. and then get ready for bed again at 7pm.   I did this for a year and my depression got pretty bad, I started drinking almost every weekend, and almost every day when I came home, I just didn't have the energy to function.

depression,3dvvep,element2,3,Mon Jul 20 10:37:25 2015 UTC,"This is something I've always struggled with. After working an office job for a year, and going back to school, the following summer I had to quit on my first day of my summer job because the idea of going back to that 9-5 grind made me have a panic attack in the parking lot. And that was only after one solid year of an office job, AND an 8 month break! Another commentor mentioned the metaphor of the ticking clock. I can relate. As I finished my undergrad this past spring, I felt that clock. The day I graduated and had to get a job was the day my life would metaphorically end to me.  So I made it my goal to figure out a way to survive without a 9-5. I'm very lucky to have worked very hard in my undergrad, with grades that netted me full funding for a Master's, which I decided to accept. So I'm getting paid to research topics that I am passionate about, more or less on my own schedule. I'm able to keep myself motivated, and while I might not work exact 9-5 hours, my progress is great, and my supervisor is more than happy. Now, in the fall I'll have to take some boring classes and spend a couple days a week on TA duties, but I think i'm still getting a pretty good deal.  But in the long term, I haven't quite figured it out yet. I'm hoping I'll be able to either start a business or become a contractor and work from home, or be like my dad and find a company that values me enough to not care where I'm working from most days of the week. Or maybe I'll just stick with academia. I'm okay with not making much money.  I think the only advice I can give to you is to not even try to accept it. If the 9-5 isn't for you, it's not for you, and forcing yourself to go through it will never get easier, only harder. From my own personal experience, just getting away from the dread of a looming 40 hour office position has improved my overall life happiness exponentially. And changing my mindset to believe it's possible to survive without one has helped even more. While I don't have any concrete solutions as to how you could get away from the 9-5, I would strongly encourage you to not give up, and to keep looking for alternatives. Don't just condemn yourself to a life that makes you miserable because you think you have to. Keep looking for other jobs / positions. Look for companies that have flexible working arrangements. Maybe you would only need to work from home an extra day a week, maybe you need full flexibility. Maybe you can work part-time. Maybe you can move somewhere closer to your job to cut down commute time. Keep brainstorming, and don't give up."

Just be positive OP. Make a pros and cons list of things you are good at or like doing then try to find jobs based off of your list!

depression,3dvvep,sodangbutthurt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Serious answer because I went through this in the past. Change jobs. Take a few weeks at work and think about what you REALLY want to do. Not only will that help you through your depression of your job now, but it will make you a lot happier. Even if it means taking lower paying jobs to work your way up to THE job you want. It's worth it. If the hours are bothering you that much, look for a job that has a different weekly setup. My job consists of 2 days on, 2 days off, 3 days on, 2 days off then 3 days off. After 2 weeks we switch to night shift. It breaks the monotony and feels like I have extra days (or nights) off. I work in the jail as a Deputy C.O. and I love what I do. I was a welder/fitter in the past, a plumber in the past, etc. The thing that ate at me WAS the same work week after week after week. I didn't know it until I took this unusual schedule, but it's the greatest. Your second biggest thing, take pride in your work, no matter what it is. If you clean toilets for a living, be the best damn toilet cleaner out there. At the same time realize they probably will have someone better than you, but the strive will keep you going. Sometimes you need a change in life to be happy, and the most of our time we have is spent at work. Got any questions pm me. I'm on mobile so it's tedious to write too much."

I was working at a job which felt very constrained (8am-4pm) and man, it was like I got home and slept. My friends wanted to go out anytime during the week and I just wanted to come home, go to bed, and do nothing. It was like 5 days out of my entire week were just gone in the blink of an eye. Then, I got let go. It was crazy because my first thought as they told me was ""holy shit, I get to leave early. Holy shit, my day tomorrow is completely free."" Time constraints aren't my thing, sadly they are my parents.  I moved to Los Angeles 4 years ago to pursue music. I went to college for 2 1/2 years trying to get an Associates, which I did. In fucking music. So of course, the job market was scarce. All I wanted to do was perfect my craft. I am a songwriter/producer and only 22 years old and all I want to do is just fucking write songs. I had exactly three months to get yet another office job. So, I did. Don't get me wrong, nice people, cool company, but shit. I'm miserable Monday-Friday and the only day I'm truly happy is when it's Saturday. I feel fucking trapped. Like a hamster running in a wheel. Quit job and then what? Can't pay rent? Say fuck it for another month and enjoy California and move home for a while? I mean what? Everyone's favorite thing to throw at me is ""this job is keeping you in California."" I'm to the point where I would rather move back home where I'm miserable, because right now I'm equally as miserable. Hell, I'm at work right now and it's not the environment, it's just me. This isn't me, nor will it ever be. I was happiest that one week I had no job when I would wake up early, go to the park, fucking enjoy life at least and just live. Shit.

depression,3e0hm0,Ausfarting,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"Hi,  In my experience talking to a professional can be helpful.   I often feel just weird and down. I have always been reserved and never a chatty person.  I always just sort of kept to myself and thought things through. But in the case of depression, or any sort of internal struggles keeping it in can do more harm than good.  I can really relate to the ideas that talking seems like a fleeting moment.  I thought this way for years.. and I must admit I was wrong.  In my opinion, taking about the maelstrom of frustration (that is driving me nuts) forces me to solidify what I'm feeling. I often take several seconds to just come up with a few adjectives. It seems silly but actually articulating a thought based on what I'm feeling makes it more concrete and real.  Then you (and your therapist / counsellor) can look at the words you have come up with. On their own. Without the confusion of your other thoughts and insecurities.   I'm not sure if this will make sense to you, but maybe think about it like writing an essay. There are a bunch of ideas and thoughts brewing in your mind. But no one can understand what's in your head until you put it in writing.   So, yes the taking part is temporary. But learning how to describe what you are feeling (in my opinion) is a valuable skill that can help you in the future."
depression,3e0hm0,futuramaviking,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a therapist right now & it is really helpful for me. Part of what's good about seeing a professional is that they can be helpful in helping you figure out what's going on. It's not like just talking with anyone. They're trained & educated on it. There are many out there with lots of experience helping people.   However, I've also seen a few therapists I didn't like, too. They are people after all & I've had a couple that our personalities just didn't mesh right. From my experience, it's good to get references & as much info on professionals before one goes to see them. & I've had the best results when I've showed up with an open mind, not expecting things to go one way or the other.   Also, from my experience, if one has not yet been diagnosed with depression, one need not be worried about having pills crammed down their throat for it. I also have yet to have a doctor or therapist make me do anything.   I've been on many different depression medications. I'm not aware of a way that one would choose to abuse any of the ones I've taken- other than purposefully overdosing. They've been mostly SSRI's. Not exactly ""street drugs"". What I've found is that there are many, many, many different meds out there, all with their own positives & negatives about them.   True story: I knew a girl once that was against seat belts because she had a friend that died somehow in a car accident because he  was wearing one. She did a speech about it in class. A little later in the semester, she did another speech based off of actual research she'd done, stating that seat belts are helpful most of the time."
depression,3dz4v7,Ah-Um,3,Mon Jul 20 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"I really, really regret going on Effexor. It helped me focus a bit and think a bit more clearly, but if I missed ONE dose, fuck, all hell was loose. Mood swings like crazy. I felt like I was always just a little bit off balance at all times. Racing thoughts, dizzyness, trouble thinking of words. Absolutely awful. I'm trying to slowly wean myself off them, but I don't think I could handle just dropping them cold turkey. I'd go nuts and end up worse than I was before I started on them."

Giving advice to others is easier than giving it to yourself, I can related with a lot of things you said, especially the staying up late parts, the doubting yourself part and the poor image of ones self.  But I can tell you for a fact, you deserve better. There is someone for you out there and that you are beautiful.  I would be sad if you disappeared, and I don't even know you."

Its funny how I not know you, and yet this this the most supportive anyone has ever been towards me, ever. Thank you.  I know that I'll never be at a point where I could possibly believe that I'm beautiful. I can't post photos of myself on social media. I don't even let my parents see me without makeup on or i just get comments on how sickly I look. And my dad makes comments on my weight, saying that I'm ""not getting any taller, only getting wider"".  I wish I could go out and meet people. I don't think I'll ever meet anyone new. I have such trouble talking to people, my parents and coworkers included, that I'll go days and days without having a conversation with anyone. I've lost all hope that I'll ever find anyone who could tolerate me.  I'm not going to disappear anytime soon. When I'm up at night I often have horrible horrible thoughts but I don't think I could ever act on them."
depression,3dy2bw,Somerandomderp,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Mhm, I understand where you're coming from. I had issues with even looking in the mirror sometimes, but then again the people who've seen me don't give a second look, that's why I think it's mostly in our heads.  If you ever need someone to talk with, you can send me a PM! I promise I will reply ^"

depression,3e0gsc,nebulablast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"I spent years drinking to cover up the fact that I was depressed. And the worst part, in my opinion, was that I was doing it to hide it from myself. A lot of people in my life just thought I was an alcoholic, instead of thinking that there may have been some underlying reason. What I learned from those years is that alcohol and drugs are only temporary fixes. And if you do it long enough, you risk it becoming not just part of the problem, but even making previous problems worse. When you're feeling something, don't cover it up - face it head on, explore why you feel how you feel, seek someone to talk to (like you're doing right here), and tell them how you're feeling. Start exploring other ways to deal with your depression. If you can't think of anything, then go see a doctor and see what they suggest. Maybe start going out for some short walks, or instead of Netflix, find a few of your favorite songs and listen to them for a while. Break up your routine every now and often, and when you're feeling down, avoid the alcohol - save that for when you're feeling better, because it can have a way of enhancing how you're feeling at that moment. If you're sad when you're drinking, chances are you may get sadder. If you're happy when you drink, then it stands a better chance of just enhancing your mood. But whatever you do, stay safe, and if it helps, one of my favorite personal sayings is 'everything in moderation'."

depression,3e0ej8,Landoncw,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'll say something I wish someone had said to me.    Man up.  You're a whole person and don't need anyone to survive. You may want someone in your life, you may find it helpful to have someone in your life, but you don't need someone in your life.   Don't ever crawl to someone on your belly begging them to come back. They'll lose respect for you and you'll regret it later. Let her think as long as she needs to. If she comes back, great. If not, that's ok too.   If you're that wrapped up in someone you need some time to find yourself. Seriously. Even if you get back together you'll feel better about yourself if you take the time to find yourself.    Figure out what you like. What you dont like. What you stand for, believe in, want in your life/out of your life."

It will all lead to them associating you with drama, and you will be left bereft of not only your heart, but your dignity. I did all these things not long ago, and now I will probably never talk to her again, because she probably thinks I am just going to cause shit.  Never go down that road, with anyone.  It might feel like you somehow would miss at a chance for some reconciliation, but that is outside your control right now. She needs her time and space, give that to her, no matter how hard it is for you to do.  You only have integrity and dignity in this situation. Trust me, I wish someone had told me these words before I went and did  the things I did."
depression,3e0ej8,TheConfusedMango,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and disagree with the previous posters in this thread.   Heartache is hard. We've learned to dismiss that fact because it's so often mentioned in music, movies, and such in insincere tones by people we don't believe can possibly share the same emotions. And even if they appear to, things clear up within a matter of a few scenes/songs, as that's how those media tend to work.  But it sucks.  All of your routines have been disrupted. That ""how was your day?"" text as you get off of work? Not going to happen. And there's going to be a pang of pain. You hear that song you sung together that one time? Another pang of pain. Just doing nothing, her name pops into your head for what seems like no reason? You check your phone and there's nothing from her? More pain.  It takes time for you to get used to new routines, and there's little you can do to make it better, aside from not seeing her (which I know is the exact thing you don't want to do)  From my experience, I'd suggest leaving her to her own thoughts for a few days. Then, collect your thoughts. What you really mean to say. Talk face to face, or at least on the phone. Wherever you feel you both can be the most honest. Don't ask accusatory questions or ones with ""yes or no"" answers. Just ""how have you been feeling about you and I lately?"" might be all it takes to have an open, honest conversation. Make your goal to say one or two things you feel you really need to, and spend the rest of the time making sure you understand exactly where she's coming from. Because in the end, it's how you choose to frame the situation in your own mind that will influence your emotions and relationships in the future."

depression,3dydvc,koaladiggerz,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"You said it all in the first sentence of the second paragraph (on mobile can't quote). You cannot help how the world is. You can just do your bit and live your life how you want to. I know its hard to ignore what's going on but you must try to focus on yourself and what you can do small scale. Look for the good rather than the bad. Read success stories and people who do a shit tonne of charity work or conservation effort. Read charitable organisations websites and their histories of what they have achieved and their vision for the future. Hell you may even find their mission statements resonating with you and you may volunteer! The world is not all bad. Don't watch the news, its very depressing.   You have a privileged life and you could not help that, just like the under privileged could not help their upbringing. But you must seize the day and make the most of the opportunity. That's what those underprivileged people would do if they were in your shoes!! Don't waste time feeling guilty. The way to snap out of this feeling is to adjust your perspective and view these issues and your life in a new light"
depression,3dydvc,koaladiggerz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"This is great advice.  But I just don't know how to adjust my perspective.  Right now, I feel like the rare moments when I am happy are the result of me deluding myself about how terrible a place this world actually is.  Right or wrong, it's a very strong feeling and it's not something I've been able to shake.  I'll try looking into nonprofits, maybe that will help.  Thanks for commenting."
depression,3dydvc,MiserereMeiDeus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"I understand its so hard to shake when some things are just so fundamentally wrong with the world. The truth is like you said you single handedly cannot stop a lot of these horrific events. Your life and your well-being should not suffer for it. Once you get involved with helping a small group, local or national or international scale you will probably feel those bad feels go away because you can see the positive impact.   I've had a quick Google and come across blogs of people who feel the same. Their advice is to stay thankful and involve yourself in the charity work or anything which helps people. There will always be bad things in the world, however there will also be amazing people like you willing to change and do something about it!  Try restore your faith in the world, connect with a more spiritual or religious side of yourself?  If all else fails....Try distract yourself so you don't have time to be thinking about these bad things."

depression,3e0dqu,Mr-Nobody42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"It's good that you hold to your own morals and trust your own logic. A lot of people barely have morals, let alone a bit of logic (I see quite a few of them at my job on a day to day basis working as a cashier). But something that may help is the fact that other people are their own people - you can't control them. Trust me, that's a good thing. I've had plenty of people in my own life who have thought that I can barely function on my own without ever really getting to know me. Friends, family, even complete strangers. And it effects both sides of the fence - the person who can't control another person gets frustrated that this other person just won't see it their way. On the flip side, the person that's on the receiving end may not want to feel controlled, even if the person trying to influence control has their best intentions in mind. Instead, focus more on trying to control your own situation. One way - stop googling what may or may not be wrong with you. If you haven't seen a medical professional, go see one. They're trained to help find out what may be ailing you, and if there is, they're educated to find ways to help you through it. And embrace the fact that no one is perfect. Not even yourself. Give up the notion that you have to be perfect, and you liberate yourself from the chains that come along with that need for perfection.  And I'd also encourage you to, when you're feeling alone, come back. No, not everything you post may get a response, but that doesn't mean you stop trying. When you're lonely, post. Or - lurk through /r/depression and see if anyone's struggling with something along the same lines that you are. Engage them, talk to them, explore what you're going through and what they're going through. Sometimes just getting it off your chest - or listening to someone else - can be enough to at least alleviate the pain."

depression,3dxsao,poofity,5,Mon Jul 20 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"Makes me think of a post I read earlier on this subreddit;  ""On paper, and by any relative standard, my life is good. In practice, I am consistently unhappy and have been for years. Absolutely no undertaking great or small yields a positive psychological return on investment.  I'm sick and tired of trying to improve. I refuse to try anymore. Meditation, CBT, SSRIs, diet, exercise, counseling. What a travesty that there exist sentient beings who must limp through one hoop after another for the reward of mere contentment. Contentment should be our birthright, our minimum condition, not the paltry reward for so much struggling.  I will not kill myself for two reasons: cowardice, and because my death will inflict more collective pain than it will alleviate. I will not hurt others, even indirectly.  My only consolation is that I will never, ever procreate. Life is a monster, but it will never touch my children. No disease, no tyrant, no disappointment will ever afflict them. They will never be patients, victims, statistics, corpses.  And I will never be a father -- what I once dreamed of being.  Whatever hypothetical gods are responsible for this perpetual suffering machine: I hope you utterly die. I'd wish suffering on you prior, but I am kinder to our tormentors than you are to your own misbegotten children.""  I am way too young to even think of these questions. Sometimes I feel others are too young to think about mine.  ASD, ADD and bipolar here. Reality just consists of nebulous and ineffable experiences, one after the other; it's pretty messed up crying in a merry-go-round.  Attacking passions with passions... that was powerful.

depression,3dxv8j,Okiesmokie,3,Mon Jul 20 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine how you must be feeling right now, but I wanted to say something.  Being in a relationship with someone who has depression can be tiring, it's true. In a way you start to blame yourself, wondering why your significant other just can't be happy. It sounds like she had a lot of repressed feelings that she didn't speak to you about, probably because she didn't want to upset you further when they came up, so she bottled them up and they ended up... Sort of exploding.  Anger can only last so long, if you two were in a ten year relationship I'm sure that she is feeling saddened right now too. She might want to cut off communication with you, but after a while she might very well end up missing you. I'm not certain, since I don't know her, but I would give it a few more days. If she hasn't blocked you off completely maybe just send her a long apology message. Don't overwhelm her though, send one explaining yourself and use proper wording, make sure to make it sound like you are not blaming her. I would write it out and tweak it until it sounded okay.  In the long run, you should try to do things that make you happy. If you have a hobby try focusing on that, or rewatch your favourite TV series, or try to get together with old friends. I know it will be difficult since most things will probably remind you of her, that's probably unavoidable considering the length of your relationship. You say you have no one else, but maybe there is another person you can speak to? Even if you check out the local meetings, there might be a support group of kinds.

Sort of exploding.   This just seems incredibly.. unfair.  I'm sure you are correct and that is what happened, but I don't know why she would have been afraid to discuss it with me.  If upsetting me was her reason for not doing it, breaking up with me did not help that cause.   If she hasn't blocked you off completely maybe just send her a long apology message.   I wish I had the means to do that.  She will not talk to me at all.  She went through and deleted/blocked me on every method we used to talk.  She even went so far as to delete her facebook account, and I believe she changed her cellphone number.   In the long run, you should try to do things that make you happy.   The problem is that I don't know what makes me happy any more.  It seems like the only thing that made me happy was her.   You say you have no one else, but maybe there is another person you can speak to? Even if you check out the local meetings, there might be a support group of kinds.   There is no one else I feel comfortable talking to.  I'm a very introverted person, and have a very hard time making friends.  I don't think I would feel comfortable talking to strangers.   Anyways, I hope this helped in someway. I really do feel for you.   Thank you for your kind words and advice, it does help to read it."
depression,3dxv8j,Hashslingingslashar,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Wow that's rough. I've gone through a similar experience recently, albeit we dated for 3 months, not 10 years... I can't even imagine that. In my relationship I was blind sided by the breakup, she said she still wanted to be friends, and I agreed but.. shit it's been tough. When she would tell me about dates with other guys it would kill me a little bit, but I didn't want to lose her as a friend so I just acted like a friend and asked her about it and whatnot. Now we're starting to distance ourselves, and it's difficult. I realize I had been emotionally dependent on her, that my mood would depend on how I would interact with her... I feel you may be the same. Frankly, I considered cutting her out of my life briefly so as to go ""cold turkey"" and learn to become emotionally independent again. Luckily I feel I've managed to do that without cutting her out. BUT the idea of emotional dependency might be worth your consideration, as you can read up about it and try to understand how you feel, and what steps you might need to take to break out of the cycle."

TRUE friends are few and far between and the number of people who want to say the right thing but aren't down to actually do anything us huge. That's not a depression thing, that's a human thing. It's hard to get people to help you move, let alone help you carry emotional baggage.

depression,3dzs4i,pger100,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"When I was going through depression in college, my wife (then girlfriend) would call me at least once per day.  I hated it, I just wanted to wallow and binge watch tv shows, but she'd keep calling me for me to visit her, to make dinner together, etc.  It wasn't a magic cure, it didn't make me better, but what it did is it kept me from getting worse.  One word of advice is to not get mad at her if she doesn't pick up.  My GF did this and it just made me afraid to pick up.  My condition meant that I wasn't always going to pick up right away, or sometimes I wanted to ignore her call.  She'd get pissed at me and she would make me suffer for it when I finally did pick up.  So then I avoided picking up even more.  It became a bid deal, but we talked through it and came to the agreement that she'd never judge me over picking up again as long as I stopped avoiding her so much.  In any case, if you'd like to avoid this all together, be understanding when she tries to avoid you and let her know it's okay you just wanted to hear her voice whenever she's willing to use it to you."

depression,3dznwa,thalaineem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"yeah trolls absolutely enjoy getting a reaction from you.whatever it is, if you answer you waste your time and they win.    sometimes you just need to get that to win the game you need to not play the game, that's it; when you don't react to them, don't be mistaken, it's they that feel bad, they can't feel your turmoil,they need to see a message to know they've had effect. ignore them is the best way to get back at them    Maybe try to see it that it's disrespectful towards your other commentators to react to trolls. Often I see people pay attention to trolls and not to people posting positive messages. Most of the time people that support you would love to have your attention as well, so it doesn't really make sense to pay attention to people that want to hurt you instead of the ones supporting you."
depression,3dy7v4,pantsforsatan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who has recently got the better of their own eating disorder, here are some thing I find work for me;  Avoid diet sodas completely. Because they are zero calories, somehow technically my mind convinces me they are okay.. They aren't, and are highly linked to depression. I find drinking them enhances my appetite, also. Keeping my daily water intake at 3L+ is now a necessity.  Avoid 'trigger' foods. Think about it; what foods are there that you just consume copious amounts of? For me, it's cereal and cereal bars.   Sometimes I'll just get a KG of carrots, and munch my way through them. It's cheap and only a few hundred calories.   Find an exercise that you enjoy, and can do often. I find running in the morning keeps me focussed for the rest of the day.   Also, the 'other things' are probably all related to your depression/eating disorder. Message me if you want to chat.  :)"
depression,3dy7v4,fishincarnate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such a helpful response. I leave for work in a bit but I might take you up on that. I am aware that all of my mental disorders are at play here which is why I mentioned having them. Carrots sound like a good thing to do. Last year before the incident which caused the aforementioned trauma I had been going to the gym and eating healthy, and was doing so in mentally healthy ways. No complete cutting of anything, just a regular amount of exercise every day or other and a diet that was mostly whole. That's just so hard to do when cooking isn't something you can drive yourself to do. My biggest triggers are ready-to-eat hot food that I can get on my way to/from work. I do not really leave the house for much else but to go to work, and if it wouldn't be the end of my existence as a relatively independent young adult I wouldn't do that. I am trying to replace the urge to stop with healthier, cheaper alternatives. It is very easy to rationalize $1 sandwiches but when enough carrots to keep you full for the day is two it starts to make less sense. If nothing else I posted to help make myself more aware of my options."

His genes might, but you don't get that power, not that you would want it. Maybe she is scared, because she knows how much it hurts you and doesn't want others to suffer, also.

You're absolutely correct in saying that it could be worse. It could be MUCH worse. You could be homeless, sick, no food, etc. Every single thing you listed wrong with your life is fixable, and it's easily within your own power to do so. In this economy, plenty of people are still living with their parents. If you're not okay with being out of shape, hit the gym! I know some people who didn't even lose their virginity until late 20s, so don't worry about that either. For a job, if you don't have any particular skill-sets, you could always work retail or fast food. Or perhaps you'd like to acquire some, so you could take some classes at your local community college. If you want your license, just practice with your parents! parking lots, quiet suburban streets, main roads on the weekend, and finally rush hour. Then, with your fancy new job, you can start saving up and eventually buy a used car. If this all seems like a large daunting challenge to you, then consider the following: most people in the world are not in the 1%, and they have to go through all of this just like you. Most people start from nothing, and work up. You are not alone."

depression,3dtpyn,wolfman1911,25,Sun Jul 19 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"I can partially relate to your situation. I remember the first time I opened up about having severe depression was to my boyfriend (now ex-), in 2010. He just laughed in my face, called me an idiot for saying that and denied that there was anything wrong with me even though I was pouring my heart out to him. I finally felt comfortable with opening up to someone and he basically threw it in my face and made me feel even more alone and silly for telling anyone. Safe to say that relationship didn't last long after that and it took me a long while to work up the courage to talk to anyone else.  I now have a boyfriend of 4 years who even though sometimes he cannot understand how and why I feel the way that I do on occasion, he is really supportive and tries hard to help. I'm not saying you should find someone else, because it took my current boyfriend a few days to accept it as well. I just want you to know that it is not stupid or silly to open up to someone, some people may be confused or in denial because they see you in a different light or don't want to believe you are unhappy. Do not let this one person deter you from speaking to someone else because I did, and it cost me a few good years of my life hugs"
depression,3dtpyn,mcnuggetprincess,8,Sun Jul 19 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but there's kind of a difference between taking a few days to accept it and replying with basically 'well then, you should kill yourself'.

depression,3dtpyn,ProjectMorpheus,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.

depression,3dtpyn,wittyrandomusername,13,Tue Jul 21 11:28:06 2015 UTC,"Wow it sounds exactly like my Dad. Maybe he just felt helpless, and because of that guilty that he couldn't have an answer.   Did you talk to him about your depression prior to this seriously or was it just small mentions here and there, like with my family. I hope we can communicate our sadness so they understand.  With my Dad though he's just the type of guy who will mock depression and say you're just weak. If I mentioned that I wish I could die he would suggest that instead I should live a risky life of adventure, he just can't understand that I want nothing to do with the world whatsoever. Maybe your boyfriend is the same way.  It's not an excuse to have that kind of reaction consistently though."
depression,3dtpyn,neuropharm115,11,Sun Jul 19 13:36:03 2015 UTC,"First, let me say straight out that under no circumstances is it ok for him to react like that and you shouldn't have to put up with that.  I don't know his motivation, but it's possible he thinks he's helping.  It's obvious he has no idea and can't relate to what you are going through, but sometimes people think they're doing you a favor by using ""tough love"".  He doesn't understand that you are not choosing to feel like this.  Not everyone is going to understand what you're going through, and that's ok.  I remember I worked up the nerve to try and open up to my girlfriend and I told her that I think I'm depressed and her reaction was ""No you're not"".  That was the entirety of the conversation.  It hurt.  What made it hurt worse was that I knew if I was going to get better, then I had to do it without her.  I didn't leave her, I Just didn't rely on her or focus on her for anything to try and get better.  I don't have the answers as to how you can get better, but I do know the answer is not your boyfriend.  That doesn't mean you have to leave him or break up with him, I wouldn't claim to know enough about your relationship to give advice on that anyway.  But I know enough to know that there are people in the world who understand and can help, and your boyfriend is not one of them in this case.  Maybe someday he'll come around, but for now you shouldn't worry about that.  You need to focus on you.  There are people here you can talk to.  Please don't beat yourself up over what your boyfriend is saying.  Maybe he's saying it because he's a complete ass, or maybe he's a nice guy that truly thinks he's helping.  Either way he's not part of the solution at this point.  I know it's easier said than done, but don't let yourself feel bad about that."
depression,3dtpyn,Zoulz,3,Sun Jul 19 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think that's a great perspective you've offered. I'm in the recovery phase of a significant period of depression and substance abuse, and I can really relate to your belief that focusing on your strength as an individual is important in recovery. You don't want to get rid of friends and family, but you have to learn that it's unrealistic and even unfair to expect them to always have the answers or be a constant source of relief.  I would say that it's good to step back and reevaluate the people you spend time with. In OP's case I think she should examine her relationship and try to figure out her boyfriend's negative reaction. Is it from fear and maybe exhaustion from hearing her worries get progressively worse without him being able to do anything? Or is he actually a cold person who believes such a horrible thing about people who are mentally ill? I think looking back at his behavior and trying to see it objectively to see the whole picture (like writing down the events in the third person using different names)"

As someone who has been told to kill themselves by a person who should have supported me, I feel your pain. You've done absolutely nothing wrong and this reaction is sheer ignorance and stupidity provoked. When he calms down, try to explain the reality of the situation, as it's possible that he has personal prejudice against suicide victims. People fear what they don't know and sadly, people are taught how to sing national anthems, but not how to deal with us mentally ill folks. It may take a while, but if he loves you, he'll set aside his dicknail like behaviour and help. Please try to keep your head up."

It would be so easy to have feelings of inadequacy on her part. Like ""why is this relationship not enough to make you happy.""  It's hard to understand this without experience.  And while your boyfriend was certainly not helpful in his reaction, it may be a coping mechanism.  You've come to the right place. I know that this community can be so beneficial since it helps talking to those who have experienced or are experiencing the same things you are.  Complete understanding and free of judgement."

depression,3dtpyn,CrimsonQuill157,10,Mon Jul 20 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"Well maybe he means you're stupid to think that way. Please rethink this again. I don't know what happened, but maybe he's in major shock and would never want you to do that. When he told you he was gonna get the pills maybe he was mocking you and never expected that you would be in this situation. I'm not saying he's not a jerk, but people that don't go through what we do can get very scared when they hear something like that. Yes when my mother told me one day that she was depressed and wanted to kill herself, I freaked out totally and got upset at her. Your boyfriend maybe thinks you shouldn't have a reason to think that way, so he called you stupid.  Please please understand that I'm not on his side. I've been in a situation when I used to misunderstand everybody and get myself hurt."

depression,3dtpyn,Albafika,6,Sun Jul 19 14:29:09 2015 UTC,"When depression, you need to remember that many people around you, are well meaning idiots, who are going to say all the wrong things.   What your boyfriend said does not mean he wants you dead, he is just being selfish, because he is hurt. He doesn't understand depression, the changes in brain chemistry, and took it personally, as an insult.   I too has a boyfriend, who thought he was boyfriend of the year (he really wasn't, whole other story) and got really pissed off at me when it became clear saying ""I love you/your beautiful"" wasn't going to make me better. He acted like I chose this, like I was insulting him, not appreciating him, calling him worthless. He claimed he had been depressed before and 'chose' to stop being sad. So I learned the hard way he actually knew jack-shit about clinical depression, he just thought he did because he was dumped once.   Another thing you need to realize, is people just have no clue how to deal with suicidal ideation, and because people are well meaning idiots they tend to go one of two ways, either they freak out and try to put you on suicide watch despite having no plan, or they call your bluff, dismiss it - your boyfriend chose the latter, and I am so sorry, because that must feel like he is refusing to see your pain.   The proper way to respond is to talk about it, let the person express their feelings, and reassure them that you want them around, you you would really like them to hang on and do treatment to try and get out of the dark place they are in now.   Your boyfriend is an idiot, but it sounds like he is really scared and doesn't know how to deal with this. I'm sorry. Professionals would know how to help you, what to say, there are many websites and books that can help guide you both through your recovery. I really hope you can get past this incident, please don't worry about opening up again, this is his problem, you did nothing wrong, you didn't ask for this, and you are just trying to get yourself together.    Well done for opening up, because that is whats really the hard part, Im so sorry your boyfriend reacted so wrongly."
depression,3dtpyn,Infuser,4,Sun Jul 19 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"He probably sees it as ""I'm bored, I want to kill myself"", meaning he's not enough for you? I'unno, but hopefully he reaches back to you with a clearer mindset."

depression,3dtpyn,Pannanana,4,Sun Jul 19 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"""You can't be upset at someone being mad after hearing that""  ""Raw emotion and reaction are the only thing that will come from that.""  She didn't need a perfect reaction, but throwing in a false dilemma - either she'd get a terrible reaction or a ""perfect, refined, restrained reaction"" - doesn't help your case.  There is no way to receive that kind of information and react perfectly. What is a perfect reaction? Who knows. Being yelled at, belittled and entirely disregarded constitute the exact opposite of that, though.  If she can't even confide her innermost feelings of desperation with someone who loves her without expecting a torrent of abuse it's no wonder she's reached such a level of despair in the first place."

She's never been in the other person's shoes, so how would she be able to empathize? I can because I have been there.   He shouldn't judge her or make her feel bad, but I'm fully behind anger as a first reaction.  This is definitely something to be angry over. It's not a bullshit argument. It's desiring a permanent solution to a temporary solution."

Why judge him? How could she know what it means to be that horny?  There's no focus on the anger in this issue but its expression. We can't judge feelings - those are beyond control - but we can sure as hell judge actions when they constitute outright abuse.  His were deplorable.

I think he was trying to support you in how you feel and it might've backfired. Then by calling it stupid- he's referring to the concept of depression, since it's illogical- hes actually referring to the illness, not you personally. What he may not realize is that it invalidates your feelings, making you feel worse. He wants to support you, from what it sounds like to me. but perhaps doesnt know how. Teach him how to best support you. Some people are helped by pointing out how illogical their thinking can be. It sounds like that isn't the case for you. Perhaps you just want to be heard? Sympathized with? Whatever it is you 'need' from him, tell him.

Love, when confronted with circumstances that could end it, should rise to the occasion and overcome - not buckle under the pressure. And that's what he's doing - whether he can 'handle' it or not, he's still letting you down. He's still failing you. The first time I admitted to my wife that I was suffering from depression, she straight up told me that she didn't suffer from depression, so she didn't completely understand it - but that she was willing to learn. The first time I had a complete meltdown and told her I was thinking of 'downing 12 energy drinks and a bottle of sleeping pills to see which wins out first', she pulled me into her arms and gave me the support I needed to find my way out of the darkness. She became my light.  That's what you need - someone who can provide a light to help guide you out of the darkness when you find yourself spiraling further into the darkness."

It causes them to direct their anger at us as it ""appears"" as though we are the threat that might cause them to lose us.

The first thing is to accept your face is the way it is and unless you get surgery, it's going to stay that way. That is the cold hard truth, but do not despair.  I checked your comment history and you do spend a lot of time analysing your hair line and big nose and telling yourself your ugliness is the reason people ignore you and the reason why your life is doomed. Will complaining about being ugly make you any less ugly? No. Redirect your energies and for starters, resist from posting anymore comments about your appearance because the more you tell yourself something the more you will believe it.  Don't fall into the trap of blaming all your problems on your face. If you don't get a job, don't automatically think 'it was because I'm ugly', it could well have been because there were others more suited to the position. If a girl doesn't text you back, maybe she just didn't think you had chemistry.  Personality and confidence are SO important and I think they're the areas you need to work on. Forget your ugliness and get in shape, get some hobbies you can be passionate about and get reading - there are so many brilliant books on how to raise your self esteem and boost your confidence. A good personality can make a 5 shoot up to an 8 instantly. It is true that you might have to work a little bit harder than a typically attractive guy but so what?

Those ""ugly"" people live on the fringe of society and feel that they'll never be loved because of how they look.  Guess what?  There are plenty of ugly - yes, really, truly ugly people out there who wind up happy, in a relationship, loved and wanted. Because there are people out there who WILL like you for your personality whatever it may be.  Yes, life will be harder when you're not what society calls beautiful or even somewhat nice-looking. You'll get rejected much more, you'll cry a lot harder. You'll get less if no compliments. People will be cruel. It will hurt time and time again and then some.  But there are people out there who will rise up above it even when others put them down; they'll put it behind them and put their best foot forward. They can and have won people over even if it has been hard.  It has been proven time and time again, throughout history and the ages and will continue to be.  Ugly people, different looking ones, people with deformities and disabilities, people of races looked down upon - life is much harder but not impossible. So many of these people have and will continue to find those out there that care for them above and beyond the beauty which society will always put on a pedestal.   It is cheesy and corny and everything else - but it doesn't stop it from being true.   And let us be honest - majority of plainer, unattractive and ugly people have shown to be far better than their lovely counterparts many times. It seems the harshness and brutal honesty of life has molded them into better people.  If you cannot be beautiful, be kind. If you can't be pretty, be nice, be sweet. If you cannot be handsome, be helpful, be loyal. Be a decent human being.   You will eventually find someone who will see these qualities in you that more than make up for what you lack physically."

Acceptance and all that. But I don't care really.   I crack jokes to help me ""hey you're let!"" Me- ""sorry I'm late. I was fixing my hair."" Guaranteed laughs, at least for me.   And dude you may think you're ugly, whatever. You got something you can improve though. Look at your self image and figure out what you'd like to change. Maybe get in shape? Maybe think about getting clear braces.   Then you can work on your charisma. Luckily us guys aren't really required to look hot but what we are required to have is a certain sort of confidence and bravado. If you can nail that, dude you'll have it made."

Ultimately it doesn't matter who she sleeps with when it's over. I'd redefine your ''best friend'' though, what kind of best friend does that? Perhaps you ultimately wanted to share the rest of your life with her, but don't be too greedy when we're talking about a human being.I say 8 years of her prime years in her youth is not nothing.    A bad ending of the story doesn't necessarily mean a bad story.In my opinion."

depression,3dwyn4,Reddits_best_name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this post was worth it. And don't apologize - sounds like you're going through a lot and in need of expressing it - when you apologize for how you feel, you're apologizing for being honest. Never, ever apologize for being honest.  Reading through this, what I want to ask you is this - have you tried alternative methods to expressing your anger? If you have, try again - I'm sorry if that sounds cold or insensitive, but I'm only saying it to help. In relation to my own depression, when I start to spiral into a darker place in my mind, I pick up an old hobby; sometimes I pick up the guitar and spend a few hours playing. Or I grab my pen and notebook, and write. Sometimes I draw. But they all tend to be temporary - mainly because they help, at least for a time being. But if it helps me get through the worst of the feelings I'm trying to get through, then I consider that a win. Maybe a small win, but it's a win. When I was younger, I was picked on and bullied constantly, which lead to suicide attempts, which spiraled out into substance abuse - and I can tell you from experience, the alcohol and the drugs (hopefully just weed, but if there's others, I'm not judging - I'm no saint myself) may help in the short-term, but in the long-term, they'll only enable the depression, and add a new depth to your depression - and considering how depression can sometimes make people feel like they're 'drowning', adding more depth to that ocean is the last thing you want to do, because you'll only sink deeper and deeper every time.   Now, to address your feelings of loneliness - again, the depression - but here we have the chance for a win. It may be small, it may be huge, but you won't know until you try. What I'm driving at is - you're not alone. You really aren't. And I hope you find that out here in /r/depression. Lurk other peoples posts, read the comments, see what others are going through - you may find someone who is going through something similar to what you're going through to a degree. But give it a shot. It's worth it. You're worth it. Based off this post alone, I can tell you've lead an interesting life - maybe not the easiest of lives, but at the very least, an interesting one. You have a story to tell, and a unique one. Tell it. Keep telling. Because as you continue on through life, you'll add chapters to your story. And those chapters, those stories, as you tell them - it could save someone's life, just knowing that there's someone out there who can relate, even if it's in a small way. I know life can be a struggle, to this day I still wonder how I've made it this far, but I keep fighting. Even if it's day to day. If that helps, then do it - day by day. Step by step. Keep fighting. Because you're worth it. You really are."

Though we may not all suffer from the same problems, we most often suffer from the same emotions and the best thing we can do for each other is to support and lift each other up when we are low.

I have interests, but no one else seems to be into the same things. If I find someone who likes the same music or movies that pretty much winds up being the only thing we have in common. It's also very hard for me to talk to people because my thoughts are almost always a nebulous cloud of random ideas. I can't come up with responses or conversation very quickly. I'm just too weird, I think. I've even had people kind of rub it in my face that I'm alone. Yeah, I kind of realized a while back that I'm not meant to be with anyone.   You might meet someone, you might not. I wish I had more hopeful words for you, but I know how this sort of thing turns out. My advice is that you absorb yourself in whatever strikes your fancy. Do what you like to do, go out, enjoy yourself. If you're lucky enough to meet someone willing to share that experience, then that's the ultimate bonus. Otherwise, get out of life what you can."

I've had a few even have a crush on me, one of them being one of my best female friends way back, but because I was so oblivious to it, that never happened.  Loneliness is a goddamn curse. I find it uncomfortable being around my best friend sometimes too because he's had a more successful social life than me, despite him saying that he has/had social anxiety. He's even rubbed it in me that he has a girlfriend a few times too (One instance with him even laughing about it) and it really made me feel inadequate and worthless. Fun times, I guess."

It's been eight years for me and I too feel lonely pretty much every day. I may be able to distract myself during the day, but when I go to bed it hits like a truck. I even bought a smaller bed several years ago so it just doesn't feel so empty.  I've been rejected a couple months back, and it was pretty much the first time since back then that I tried to open myself up.  It sucks man, it really does.  Anyway, I can only speak for myself, but I believe one should not rely on a potential significant other to bring happiness to your live.  Bring your own happiness and happiness will come to you. Like a good karma kind of thing? I don't know really.  Try to make your own happiness, surround yourself with the things you love, the games you love, the food you love, the friends you love, make an effort to do so, and just try to have fun.  It's hard to put effort into yourself, no doubt, and even if it doesn't work right away, you can at least say: ""I tried, and I'm proud of that.""  One step at a time.  So, yeah, don't know if that was helpful or not and I pretty much suck at expressing my emotions."

I keep thinking to myself that if I try again that's what I'd do, or maybe if I was in a relationship. I want to be strong on my own but I just can't do it. I need that support and love from someone and knowing that they are close to me gives me peace of mind.

Even if it's just here, on /r/depression, we all have each other. This sub has proven to me that, when I feel like I don't have someone in my life I feel I can turn to - there's here. There's this. We all may be strangers to each other, but that gives us the unique ability to see what you're going through from a different perspective, and to honestly tell you what, at the most, what we think may help, or at the least to offer support. But what I'm sure a lot of people would like you to know is this -  You are not alone. You are never alone. When your mind is shrouded in darkness, seek a light. Seems to me like there are a lot of lights here willing to share their own warmth with you. I hope whatever storm you're going through right now passes, and if you need help, come here. Come to us. Open up - and let us help you through it."

depression,3dvivy,whoareyoutoday,5,Sun Jul 19 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"I've been in a similar situation, bro. First off, get off of Facebook as hard as it sounds. If you absolutely have to be on there, defriend/block her. You're basically poking at an open wound with a knife everytime you decided to look her up. Second off, let yourself go emotionally. Cry over her as long as you need to. But just keep in mind you lost her and you'll never get back with her again. It's so much easier to accept that than holding onto a false hope she'll come back to you. Give yourself time to recooperate and fall out of love. This may take a few more months or a few more years, it depends how strongly you felt about her. But in all likely hood, you will stop having feelings for her given enough time.   For now, just try to do shit you need to do like school/work, jack off, watch movies, play games, hang out with friends. Maybe someday, you'll meet another girl along the way and you'll forget all about your ex. Of course, only pursue a relationship when you feel that you're stable and ready to have a healthy one. Right now, you need to focus on you and work on yourself."

I was surprised that it still affected me, just like you. It didn't feel good, but it wasn't doing me any favors. So I just continued to ignore her and resist all temptations of contacting her again and after a few more years, I feel better about it.

It's been a few weeks though, and I came out on the other side.

depression,3dvivy,s1nk0,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"An ex of six months ghosted on me the day before my graduation. And he just never showed up. No contact. I was absolutely devestated.  And I just never recovered from that.  My broken heart turned into a deeper, darker depression. I stopped going out, seeing friends, working out, everything. I lived with mt best friend and I stopped seeing her because I was in bed all the time. But I managed to find time to be a fucking slut at bars and quickly double the number of people I skept with. It took me about six months to realize I was even depressed.   About three months after that he contacted me out of the blue and apologized. Still no explanation though. This was when I realized I wasn't over him and that was the source of my depression. I felt every emotion at the realization and at him. But mostly I felt down right pathetic for literally letting a guy ruin me. Before this I was a bad ass bitch, you know? Before I broke off a 1.5 year relationship because he insinuated that I should quit school and moved closer to him. And here I was fucking depressed over someone who supposedly loved me but left me in such a cruel manner. Oh yeah, and this spontaneous contact was when he told me he loved me nine months prior. That just reopened everything and I spiraled more.  A month or two later I couldn't take it anymore and began planning to move out of state.   A month or two later I accepted a job 1200 miles away.  A month later I drunk text him and end up confessing my lingering, pathetic feelings. And he said it back. He wasn't over me either. He begged me to visit him 400 miles away. And I fucking did it. I smoked more than a pack of cigarettes during that 24 hour period of the visit. I barely smoke one cigarette a month otherwise. And I show to meet his new girlfriend that I didn't know existed. And then he ended up getting sick and I fucking took care of him like the pathetic spineless piece of shit I am. Before I left, we talked about what happened to us and I didn't get a lot of answers. I left crying and drove four hours home. I didn't even make it home. I ended up in a guy's bed because I couldn't handle how much pain I was in and that was the only way I knew how to numb it.  Two days later I packed my car and left. I spent half of the first day's drive crying on the phone with anyone who would listen to me. I begged a friend to tell me how to get over this because he'd been through a similar heart break. And to my joy, he told me you don't get over these ones. You just learn how to live without them and after many failed attempts you'll learn to share that love with another person.  And I thought that fucking bullshit. I didn't love him. I told myself that over and over while we were together and when I was pissed at him for hurting me and even to him when he told me he had loved me. Because I had loved before and it was strong and overcoming, but with him it was just peaceful and wanting the best for him in every and knowing we were sage and able to overcome all.... and then I fucking realized that I had fucking loved him and I was too fucking stupid to realize it. I was comparing love to infatuation and I fucked up and I did love him. Fuck, I still do. I pulled the car over at the state line and cried and screamed and hit my steering wheel. I wasn't just running away from a shitty failed relationship anymore, I was running away from the man I loved.   And in alignment with my pathetic, spineless behavior days prior taking care of the man who ruined my life, I crossed the border to keep running.  And it worked for about a month. I felt better. Cured, even.  And then I started seeing him post things on facebook. It wasn't that bad at first. But then he posts something along the lines of ""when you're in love with someone you can't have"" and I lost it again. I wondered if it was me and if I made the biggest mistake of my life. I equally want it to be me and not to be me. I want to fucking move on with my life but I want him to be a apart of it.  I have days where I can't smile. I imagine my whole life to be without anyone because I can't get over it. I imagine my days to be empty forever. And I find myself thinking that I can't fucking handle a lifetime of that. And I sit there and just think no no no no I can't go through that. And then I do. Another grey day. Followed by another day of isolation. And another day of crying at some point, usually between home visits on my cases, and erasing the evidence.  The biggest comfort I have is my friend telling me I'll never get over him. That sounds shitty, right? Because it is. But I can see how it'll be liberating one day. To accept he'll always have a special place in my heart. To know it's normal. And that others have survived it. And that's the closest I have to a light at the end of the tunnel right now because no matter how badly I want to, I'm too afraid to talk to him again or to tell him instead of telling strangers online.  So as shitty as it is, I hope my friend's advice can help you. Hopefully more than it's helped me. His advice is based on someone he lost six years ago. They dated for basically their whole lives. Twelve years on and off. He says we'll make it through this and I hope to god he's right."

If you loved him very much, then you should never ever forget you did. Always hold him within your heart, and never forget the good times you had. No one can tell you to just get over a person, only you can decide to do that. You'll know when the time is right yourself, no matter how long it takes.  ""it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all."" Words that helped ME accept and come to terms with my lost love, and I hope they will help you too, even just a little bit."

I now know it's hers and everyone else's loss. I could go forever with out sleeping/seeing/dating anytime else because SHE takes up to much space in my heart.   I thought I was over her, I really did. I made sure I didn't see anything relating to her but that one little picture, it might as well have killed me.

I feel like if we actually see each other things will go better.  We have changed so much physically and looks wise.  Really just don't know the best way to go about this, but I have to reach out someway.  I sent flowers to her work with y phone number attached last Christmas but never heard anything.  I'm not sure if that means she never received them or if she doesn't want to hear from me or something else.  I also wrote her old address and made it so someone would have to sign off for it at the post office.  Someone did, but again I never heard anything.

If she still works there, tell her who you are first and see if she still remembers you. Tell her sorry for calling your work, but I had no other way of contacting you or something. If she does, then tell her you're in town and want to see her over a cup of coffee to catch up. If she accepts, catch up with her and just talk. See how it goes.  This is the best approach I can think of."

But then I woke up. The immediate thoughts were ""I'm such a fuck-up I can't even kill myself right."" It was - for me at least - embarrassing. And I never told anyone about it until I felt truly safe.  If you find someone judging you because of depression or suicidal thoughts, they may not be the person to be talking to about this subject. But, even if your friends and family are hours away - just remember this. We - all of us here - are only a click away. We're here to listen. You want to scream into someone's ear until it bleeds - I'm positive you'll find someone. Because I know for a fact that I'm willing. Following your instinct to get this all off your chest was a good move. And the anonymity of the internet -does- help. I know for a fact that that's the reason -I'm- here. I don't like to talk a whole lot about my depression - offline at least. But here, I feel safe to do so. And I hope you do as well.

depression,3dvgxf,schwartzbewithyou420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:40:58 2015 UTC,"I can understand the confidence issues. Back to when I was a teenager - one of my ways of dealing with my depression was art. Primarily, music.  I learned how to play the guitar, and I got pretty good in my opinion. But everyone around me tried filling my head with words about how 'really good I was', or how I should pursue it as a career. But I just wasn't that confident in myself, regardless of how good they told me I was. But what I managed to do was at least let them motivate me to at least keep playing. As I learned, what little confidence I had in my playing floundered here and there - but I kept with it. As I kept with it, my confidence grew, bit by bit.  What I'm trying to say is that confidence isn't something that'll appear in your life overnight. It's something you build, and it's something you really have to work on yourself. When people pay you compliments, I'd suggest taking it with a grain of salt - but at the same time, listen. Most people, when they compliment people, genuinely mean it. Find something you like that you may not be the best at, but you like doing. Keep it private if you have to. But work at it. If you're new to it, you won't master it overnight. But if you work at it, you'll get better - as you get better, you'll get more confident. Confidence is a flame that you have to continue fanning until it's strong enough to survive on its own.

depression,3dwq06,lonelylosercreep,4,Mon Jul 20 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"Don't let that douche ruin everything for you. My ex was 25 when I met him and I took his virginity. Also, you don't have to admit to people that you are a virgin if it bothers you that much."
depression,3dwq06,MoonBathing,4,Mon Jul 20 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"I was 21 when my wife took mine from me. And I have a bit of understanding what you're going through. Kids in high school who knew I was a virgin hassled me about it relentlessly. Even some of my friends took shots at me. But that's because a lot of them are assholes, and don't know any other way. They're stuck in their own little bubble, and they think they have it figured out, meaning they think they know how things should be - so if you haven't lived a life that parallels theirs, you're somehow in the wrong.  You're not. You live your life the way -you- want to. It's your life. And women can be fickle creatures sometimes - sometimes they can be interested in someone without ever giving a sign they are. The woman who would become my wife was interested in me all through HS, but I never knew. She never gave one sign. It wasn't until after high school that we began to date, that she told me she had this 'secret little crush' on me all those years.  There's hope. There always is, you just need to look. It may be a longer search than you'd like, but don't give up. You're worth it, and eventually you'll find someone who can see that - and that person has the potential to be your 'one'.  And I agree with MoonBathing - if peoples reactions to learning this about you does so much damage to you, stop telling people. You'll only be helping yourself. The DJ's comments weren't geared towards you specifically (at least, I sincerely hope not, because then that makes him a bigger douche-waffle than I thought), but was making a generalization. But still, forget that guy. He was in your life for a split second. I know that some people can inflict a lot of pain within that second, but it's only a second in the timeline of your life. There's more to be told in your story, all you have to do is keep going, one page at a time. Hope this helps, and take care."
depression,3dwq06,EchoesInTheMist,2,Mon Jul 20 04:22:15 2015 UTC,I don't. But most of the people I know are from hs and they all know ive never had a girlfriend. And in college a girl i was speaking to spread it to everyone that I'm a virgin aftervshe found out. That destroyed my reputation with women. And now that I'm not in college and I'm poor I haven't been able to meet any one new.but in general women are just not attracted to me even when they don't know that fact. It's like the older I get the harder it is to even meet women or have a sex life.

You're still pretty young you know.

The thing about Bojack that's quite brilliant is that underneath the cartoony looks and jokes it's actually a really accurate portrayal of chronic depression and how it can affect everyone, regardless of financial/relationship/social status.   I did however feel a very hollow feeling of despair at the message the last episode as well.

I went to work, gym, and AA and out with friends every day while my sister only went to a part time job and stayed home and my dad only went to work then came home to play video games.  I moved to a new state this year and have fallen into a slump in life being unemployed and have found the lack of responsibility and forward momentum in life, I've fallen into another depression.

Of course he's wrong trying to train you to do things the way he expects you to. On the other hand, you need to see that he is probably completely helpless about your situation and very afraid about your well-being. On the yet other hand (that makes three) he's doing the right thing by acknowledging you have a mental illness and researching about ways to help you.   The question is, do you have a depressive episode that's being taken care of by a professional, or have you never been diagnosed with depression and are just calling it ""having a bad day"", when you are suffering the way you do now? If you've never seen anyone about it and the bad days get out of control, you should see a therapist or psychiatrist about it."

Here's a sorta related tip - when a vehicle is in a driveway / street ahead of you, waiting to pull out, watch the front wheels, not the driver. The wheels are the first thing to move and the direction of the front wheels helps you know where they are going to head first when they go.

To pile on, this noise acceptance is a cultural decision; it is not a natural consequence of people living in society. For example, during chess tournaments, there is no talking allowed whatsoever. If you even say something harmless like ""nice move!"", a particularly draconian arbiter would be within his rights to disqualify you if you're an entrant, or remove you from the venue if you're a spectator.

But, I honestly believe that if you, when you're alone, you take that time to use to soul-search; explore why you feel how you feel, explore the ways it effects you. I believe that we all have a light inside us, but this light is... well, almost like a plant. It has to be nurtured, tended to, and encouraged. It needs to be fed - when you find your light, and I truly hope you do, the best way to nurture it is to expose it to the light of others.

It is never ok to do what she did, with full knowledge of the person you are and the troubles you live with.  I'm sorry to hear your life thusfar has had more lows than anyone should have to handle, and her actions compounding onto that make it just that much more numbing, but know this;   You are not crazy. You did everything you could and you were the best person you could possibly be. You are not in the wrong. Barring your mental health problems, you are the accumulation of what every SO would want in their life, and you have done nothing wrong.   I don't know why your SO would go through your email like they did, perhaps in some way to justify the divorce in one way or another. We won't fully ever know. So then, what do we know?  You're here, feeling pretty crap right now undoubtedly, but not without a light at the end of the tunnel.  During your marriage, I don't know how open about your illness you were to your SO, or how supportive they were, but in spite of everything that has happened;  now is the time to seize the future.  I am neither informed nor qualified enough to give you professional help on your problems, but from what I know right now, is that if you felt in any way shape or form that you couldn't say or explain how you felt in the past to your SO, you now have the opportunity, exempt from any judgement, to find the help you need and probably want.  In many ways I'm quite angry that you were so maintained in moving on with your life. In spite of everything, your father, your school, your depression, and then your divorce, you were ready to move on with life, even when you didn't want anything more than what you already had, but like a dagger in the back you were dragged back into this mess.  You may not see it from where you are now, but you are doing so much better than you may think.

Thanks...that is nice to hear. I guess I just wish she felt that was enough for us to work out. That's what I think. Perhaps she was feeling guilty and needed a way to make it seem like I was a bad guy anyway so breaking up was ""for the best"" - it just sucks to think she has herself convinced that I was this different person than she thought - which couldn't be further from the truth.   The truth is, I'm not maintained in moving on. I just feel as though I was thrown into this reality and I'm lost and confused on what to do. Quite frankly I don't feel right about meeting new people..even though I know that's what eventually has to happen? I don't know how to explain, I'm just confused on where to turn.

depression,3dv20z,Bdag,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I dislike the ""depression as disease"" conception that the medical model presents because while researchers can very neatly wrap all the symptoms of depression into categories and diagnostic criteria there is nowhere in the medical literature that specifically identifies the root cause of depression, only references to associations to neuro-chemical levels and brain function. The scientific community has yet to isolate a fundamental cause for depression and from my viewpoint that is because it has many different ones that range from the physiological to the psychological.  Denying that depression is an illness does not in any way deny its severity and devastating impact on the lives of those who suffer from it, much as denying that nausea is a ""disease"" does not in any way minimize the extent to which someone can suffer from its wide range of effects. When someone is nauseated they are not told they have a disease called ""Nausea"" but rather are examined to determine what its root cause is. Medications are prescribed as a treatment from the symptom to alleviate suffering, not as a cure for what is at the source of it. Without addressing the source the symptom will continue to persist.  The ""chemical imbalance"" angle is a crude reduction that takes into account the effect our body's chemical ecosystem has on our thoughts, behaviours and environment (physical & social), but tends to ignore the converse: the effects those have on that same ecosystem.  Despite all the advances in psychiatric medicine and therapy the rate of mood disorders has been increasing. One would think that had we as firm a foothold on depression as we do on other known diseases that the rate would be going the other way."

depression,3duone,TwoBraincell,7,Sun Jul 19 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time, I like feeling like a degenerate. I like feeling edgy or like I'm challenging society because of the creepy Japanese porn or the videos of people dying that I love. I'll shut myself away in my cave and eat ice cream and pizza, smoke cigarettes and drink until I feel ill, until I feel so delightfully gross; I masturbate and pass out, and wake up and masturbate again, and don't wash my hands all weekend. It's like feeling repulsive makes me feel powerful and in control, or maybe it's just the only identity I have anymore.   But ultimately, avoidance behavior breeds more avoidance behavior. Eventually I'm not shutting myself away because I like it, but because I can't bear to face the outside. What once made me feel free is now a trap.  And when I do eventually leave my cocoon, because I have to drag myself to school or work, I usually end up feeling much better than I ever did inside. Not at first, but soon after. Seeing friends and coworkers is such a relief, even if we don't talk because my mind's too full of creepy internet content and nothing else, even if they don't like me that much because I seem like a creep, just working alongside others towards a common goal feels so great.  But eventually it's time to return home. As soon as I step through the door, all that is worthwhile about the outside world vanishes. All I can feel, all I know in the whole world, is the crushing, desperate isolation. So alone. So alone. I'll do anything to escape. But once I'm home at night, there's nowhere to run to. So I hide. I hide even deeper down in my cave. It's kind of OK here. I'll stay just a little longer. I can try to fix things later, when I'm feeling more like myself."
depression,3duone,procyonine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"Hey man it's ok to have bizarre and sadistic sexual fantasies. It doesn't really mean anything except that you've watched too much porn. Really. I'm more concerned that you enjoy watching gore stuff of people getting killed ect, it could be a defense mechanism to emphatically shut yourself down from other people due to the feeling of rejection. People don't care about you, and you don't care about people. I'd urge you to completely stop watching that kind of material as it actually make you emotionally weaker, not stronger. Empathy is an emotion we actually need to function properly both in maintaining and obtaining friendships. On the bright side it seems as if you actually want to be apart of society, and that you like being around people. I can't help but think all you really need is to meet a girl and most of your inadequacies would be gone."
depression,3duone,Halfpac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"My sexual fantasies aren't sadistic. Hell, I don't even have sexual fantasies. I never think about having sex with another person, about how I'd like to have sex with this person or that. I like hentai because it doesn't involve any actual people. I can enjoy the simple pleasure of sexual stimulation without getting bogged down thinking about the people involved; ""I wonder what she does on the weekends. How's her relationship with her family? What must that guy's high school experience have been like?"" It's exhausting. Porn manga are simple and clean, but they're also a little boring after a while. That's why I love the weird ones. The crazier and more exaggerated and taboo they are the easier it is to get off. It's good because it's surreal. Not surreal maybe, maybe 'fantastical'.  I'm not into watching people die for the gore. You can see gore where the people involved live. It's on /r/WTF all the time. I like /r/watchpeopledie. I like to see the moment when someone ceases to be; when all that they are and ever could have been snaps out of existence forever like  popping a dent in a water bottle back out. It's just this easy little correction that the universe makes, like it's nothing. And it does really make me feel something. The weight and severity and permanence of it, maybe. Maybe it's just another part of being human that's only arbitrarily important, and I haven't yet white-washed it with nihilism. That seems likely. I like videos of birth, too. They're entertaining for similar reasons: the voyeurism of seeing something usually kept private; the graphic and messy and brutal nature of living and dying, of Nature itself.  What's important, though, is that I don't lack empathy when I watchpeopledie. Anything but. I watch people die to feel closer to humanity. It's our common enemy. It reminds me that death is the enemy, the only enemy and an enemy at all. And I think I know what they're going through, the people in the videos. Fear, panic, pain and confusion. Hopelessness. Happiness is what I can't empathize with! I feel most like an outsider when seeing all the upbeat reddit posts, all the cute pets and cool crafts and celebrity run-ins. They seem so hollow and unrewarding, and I can't understand why everyone's so excited about them except in a very distant, scientific way.  Ultimately, this is just how I entertain myself. If all good entertainment boils down to interesting and relatable storytelling, then it's no wonder I love to watch people die so much. I can relate to the people in the videos, and I'm very interested in dying. And whether it's /r/rule34 or /r/watchpeopledie, there's always a happy ending."
depression,3duone,procyonine,2,Mon Jul 20 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"I like some of what you said. But other parts seem quite closed.   You can experience the ""graphic and messy and brutal nature of living and dying"" in relationship too. Relationship contains many births and deaths. The death of concepts, the death of moments, the death of expectation, etc. It's jagged and messy. If you want to know life and death, relationship is a good inquiry.   I relate to your desire to dive deep into death. To not deny it, to feel it fully and be conscious of nature. Death is kept far away, we put it in nursing homes 200km away. When the person dies, we inject them with cosmetics and makeup their face to make them look alive so that ""we can remember them as they were"". So nobody sees death in the form of deterioration, in paleness, in it's true nothingness.   And then when people die, the family and friends come and weep. But even this weeping has the flavour of denial, as if their weeping will revive the dead or prevent their own death - or deny that they too are nearing death every moment. The dying are weeping over the dead. How strange.   But even so, why don't you go closer? Why do you do it through a screen that shows a recording of a person at a distance. Why don't you go to a hospice? Why don't you travel to a country where funeral pyres are open and bodies are burned meters in front of you. Where you can see the flesh burn off and yellowish gasses expel as the body falls apart?   I did this by necessity, I wanted to be fully conscious of the whole human experience and die before I was dead. Everything else seemed like a shallow compromise."
depression,3duone,Halfpac,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"Do yourself a favor and go pee in the toilet. First of all you're just further establishing a unhealthy habit every time you continue doing it, what ever problem you have that drives you to do such a thing to avoid interaction with your room mate(s) will only get worse if you keep at it. Secondly, you don't climb a mountain by jumping over it, you do it one step at a time. And I assume a shy bladder is not what's holding you back, but manning up enough to expose yourself for the unwanted conversations with your room mate(s) on your journey to and from the toilet is where you're going to have to start. Set yourself simple goals like leaving your room to get some food and beverage a couple of times a day. Eventually the anxiety that keeps you from doing so will completely go away. Not doing so will just strengthen it."

The morning of one of my pee bottle days I actually jumped out of a plane (skydiving). But after that I was quite tired and didn't want to face anyone, so you'll understand that peeing in a bottle was quite a conscious choice. I think my current goal is to find a very large bottle and to work out a splash solution. Disposal of the bottle would also become more challenging the bigger it gets. For example, a 1 litre bottle can be hidden in a small bag, but a 15 litre container would take some cunning to move out of the house without gathering attention, so I'm sure that is a transferable skill."

I've ended up, somehow, in the latter's friend group, and they're amazing people who I can talk to about anything. Let's Plays themselves are amazing things, and helped me out of some of the darkest times of my life -- it certainly isn't ""weird."" Let's Plays can cheer one up in ways nearly nothing else can.  If you need to talk, shoot me a PM. I may just be a random internet person, but I'm pretty good at talking to people.   One day, you'll find true friends -- I was once that person who never had a true circle, was always on the outskirts, and then I found these amazing people who I really connect with.

You see a lack of logical completeness or consistency because you're only referring to book knowledge. You got annoyed when things weren't defined perfectly, even though we're talking about subjective experience. But did you understand the gist? When someone gives a metaphor, do you get annoyed and beat your fists on the table because the terms aren't perfectly isomorphic?  With regular attention, thoughts can be observed as they arise and subside. The only way to see this is by actually doing it. A neuroanatomical explanation wouldn't convince you of anything if you didn't have the direct experience of witnessing thoughts in the same way that you can witness birds in the sky.  After watching for a while, you realize that following thoughts is optional. Following is when you forget your place as the witness and see external experience as the thought itself. What is belief? Just a poorly defined word to describe the gist of this following process.   If a thought arises ""I am an elephant"" or ""I have purple skin"", I will dismiss it as untrue immediately. If a thought arises ""I am a burden on others"", maybe I buy it because it seems to fit my circumstance better. But both are untrue, and both can be dismissed."

Justin blew up on him. I never knew he was having such a hard time because he always seemed so lively. But I guess he had a really bad relationship with his dad, felt like a lot of his friends used him, and struggled financially growing up. In my eyes this was the coolest kid, you know? He wasn't this loser that he thought he was. Eventually he stopped talking to all of us, I've tried getting a hold of him but he never calls back. He was mad at me because he overheard me making a comment about his pill usage, i thought he was overdoing it. Honestly maybe I sounded judgmental, but I was just worried about him.

If your father, nor mother (hopefully not), are readily available to provide you with the support you need and want, then you need to seek out a therapist or alternative strategies for dealing with your depression.  Coming here is a good start. Who else but those who've dealt with the same emotions, or lackthereof in some cases, are better equipped to help those who need it? But you can do more.  If you're still in school or university, most schools / campuses offer counselling services (some even for free). If this is you, seek them out. My university offers free counselling services that I've often considered going to but shied away from.  If you have any close friends who you feel close enough to to share your true feelings with and talk them over with them, go to them if you think they will listen.  If else, go to a therapist, consider medication possibly. My sister had and currently still has depression and utilised both of these resources and is much better now than she was months ago.  My point is ultimately, when you're someone who relates to other people in this particular subreddit, you need to utilise all forms of help you can get access to, especially in lieu of your parents, I'm sorry to find out."

There's been so many girls I could've been with yet my wonderful body makes that not even a possibility. Also there's the stigma. Most people can't relate and have no idea the internal pain you feel. This has led me to major depersonalization. My reality is a nightmare. Although life is shit for some of us, I find a bit of peace with the fact that there's others out there with the same problems.

depression,3dv7v7,youngibs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"I've tried so hard. I've tried every avenue but nothing helps amd everyone just thinks I'm crazy. All I ever get told is to go on tablets but I've done it before and it never helped. It's the symptoms, not my mindset. My whole life has fell apart. I don't kick off for a few weeks and everyone thinks I'm fine but of course, the frustration grows again. Everyone thinks I'm childish, a spoilt little brat at 26 but fact is I can NOT live like this. Just 4 years ago I was jack the lad put drinking every weekend, alpha male of a huge social group, could (albeit arrogant) have any girl I wanted. I got this girl (now ex), we spent many months before we got together falling for eachother and everyone knew it. When she wanted to help with my charity, feelings developed so quickly, it was obvious she was heed over heels for me and her friends would always make comments, amd I was for her too. She'd take time off her £70k/year job to help with the event, asking me to go out for breakfast, and spending all day with me. She enjoyed it so much she didn't even care but her work. But of course I couldn't display affection and that led up to her sleeping with a close friend due to her depressed rejection felt. We got together anyway and she spend hundreds on me, health food, taking me to doctors etc but my health didn't improve. The poor girl loved me so much but felt so helpless. As for the depoersonalision thing, hell yeah, half the time I'd distance myself because my mouth was so disgusting, esophagus so sore and then I'd berate her for the littlest of things. On the one day every 2-3 months I'd treat her like absolute gold,  not for any reason other than I loved her. I couldn't be like that all the time though obviously and it'd hurt her so so much. My bitterness wouldn't stop growing. And still doesn't.  And now all my family want me to do is go into a mental hospital but I know it'll only make me worse. Forced onto tablets that will not improve my symptoms and just keep my a host of other ones.  I had the world at my feet before this and now I have nothing. I can't even respect my family anymore because of lack of empathy. I certainly can't live my life like this any more. I've spent 8hours a day for the past 4 years researching and trying something different that might help. But no, nothing does. How i feel on those one good days ever few months though is amazing. I'm so comfortable in my own skin, feel so strong but then I come crashing down twice as hard as soon as I eat/drinking something..  even just a glass of water. I can't do it anymore. I really don't want to wake up in this world that I've lost anymore. It's torn family apart, the memory of my best mate apart along with the charity, the love of my life, can't work, can't keep talking about it, can't find any help. I know.I'm ready to go I'm just being too much of a coward."

It sounds a lot like he's just in it for him. If he's not making an effort to understand what you're going through and support you, than I'm with scratch on this one - start exploring your options. Yes, it's scary trying to think of the future when you're so unsure of the present. But don't let that further cripple you. Talk to your parents about moving in with them temporarily until you can get back on your feet, financially and emotionally. If he isn't taking the steps to help you, then start taking steps to help yourself. Small ones at first, bigger ones when you feel more confident. But the small steps are important, because each small step leads to a small victory, and with each small victory, you come closer to a larger victory - those big steps you can take. And while you're winning those small victories, your confidence will grow. Take care of yourself. If you feel you don't matter to him, don't let that effect your mindset. You do matter. You are worth the fight. If not to him, then to someone who can and will support you and seek to understand you. I hope you the best of luck in whatever you choose to do, and  I sincerely hope that your situation does improve. Keep fighting. It's worth it. It may not be easy, but it is worth it."

depression,3dx0wk,acakewithwings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:32 2015 UTC,"[Coming from someone who is yet to be involved in a relationship]  In my opinion, I would say the right time comes when you feel comfortable enough around them to be open about something as delicate as this. I want to say that you shouldn't have to worry for a while, because if they are as seriously devoted to the relationship as you plan on being they won't be asking those sort of questions very early on. It gives you room to build up the relationship and get a feel of how they would react to you telling them about your situation.  I want to believe that everything would go as planned but unfortunately some people don't react as well as others to news like your mental health. The only important thing is that you do what's best for you. If you get to the point where you open up to them, and things don't go as planned do what's best for you. That doesn't necessarily mean dump them or end things with them immediately. People can change and come around to see things differently. This may happen if things go haywire. But FYI, if they're anything like your average man (am one, can confirm what the average is like) they won't ask probing questions like that so soon into a relationship. Guys are like what parents say spiders are like. They're more scared of you than you are of them. So...  When is the right time then?  You will find the person you wish to be with one day. It may be when you meet one of these two men, it may be later on. But the right time comes when you're comfortable enough with them to share your innermost thoughts and feelings with them. Whether that be after a week or month, or maybe even a year depending on your circumstances.   Don't hide who you are to make your partner's life easier. However, don't tie them onto the emotional boatload you have to deal with on day 1.  Sorry if that sounded vague, it was intentional. In spite of the average man, every single one has the potential to act differently to finding out about their SO's inner thoughts and feelings. Hopefully though if you feel you've chosen good men amidst the crop of everything else on Tinder, you should be better off from the start. Good luck OP.  (You're not slightly weird for being depressed, don't worry, and it's not a slightly weird question to ask.)"

I almost told the previous guy I was involved with but he would've bunked and he wasn't worth the trust anyway!   It does feel like a big trust issue and although one of them has shared a bit of personal information we haven't met yet and I don't think this is the kind of thing I want to mention via text or whatever and besides like you say, I need to feel comfortable enough that hes not going to flip out or whatever  Again thank you very much, you've really helped :)"
depression,3dvgan,dersteppenwolf,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"To continue my rant, it's like I can't possibly win.  My lack of experience, socially and dating, is a tremendous disadvantage.  The fact that there is nothing more repulsive to people than someone who is desperate for human companionship, surely doesn't help.  The fact that my support network is not good, and that every real bad rejection or disappointment raises the specter of a 6 year long depression is not helpful.  I know everyone has their obstacles, and so I kind of can accept that those are mine.  What is soul-crushing is that I finally get a friend, which wasn't easy, and there was an incredible amount of anxiety involved in getting that far, and then they drop you because they think your feelings for them are too strong.  I went through a brief fasting phase in college, and a bacon double cheeseburger at BK tastes like the best thing you've ever eaten provided you hadn't eaten anything in 2-3 days.  There's just no way I can make a new friend after where I came from without them being very important to me, but the fact they are important to me kills the friendship.  So if I just magically had 3 good friends and a girlfriend, I think I would be doing great, but you have to start at 1.  Not only do you have to start at 1, but then you have to be super careful not to lean on them too much or you kill the friendship, which I did try to be the last time, but it was still not enough.  Then I'm just envisioning that if I ever do get a girl to want to sleep with me that they will then dump me for my sexual inexperience.  Then you read stories where someone like me actual, against amazing odds, have a real girlfriend, but then the woman starts to thinking how the guy would really be ecstatic to have any girlfriend at all, and the woman tricks herself into thinking that she is therefore not special enough, and then dumps the guy.  That hasn't happened to me, but it just seems like every time things have gone a little bit good for me that it always comes crashing down, and there just seems to be no shortage of ways for that to happen."

depression,3dvgan,RyanKinder,0,Tue Jul 21 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"It would be difficult to give advice without knowing the intimate details of your life. My recommendation is to speak to a neutral party... yes, a therapist. They can step back, ask the questions that need to be asked and offer solutions that can help. For example: The best way to meet people is by volunteering to do things you enjoy doing. But unless you come to terms with examining your life, it might be hard to form lifelong bonds. So, seek out a therapist. Don't just settle on the first one unless they truly converse with you well enough."
depression,3dvgan,RyanKinder,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"I do have a therapist.  I've seen him a couple months now, but I'm thinking maybe to try someone else.  It's annoying because the first few weeks are just getting to know me, and it's always annoying to start over, especially kind of in the middle of all this shit.  Anyway, thanks for commenting.  I guess I don't really expect people to have solutions that my 37 years of life and countless hours of talking to therapists and the like haven't dug up already, but it would have been depressing to come back to no comments so thank you for sparing me from that."

I know, it sounds awful but there were kernals of advice in there that still ring true to me. For example... the fallacy of ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" He goes on to say the real strategy should be ""if at first you don't succeed, wait. Think of a different approach. If the second time you don't succeed move on to something/someone else."" This will work in all aspects, including therapists. New one didn't work? Find one at a completely different practice (be sure to research them first.) That one doesn't work out for you? Maybe one on one therapists aren't good for you. Maybe group therapy is what you need. Or maybe personal therapy by ways of a personal blog, vlog, whatever... then find other blogs like yours from people with your same issues.  Commisserate and learn together. This is just the tip of the iceberg in overcoming the shit heaps of obstacles life throws at us."

I'm a complete drag around the people I live with most days and it takes every ounce of composure I have not to bite heads off over every little insignificant thing.  I'm extremely lonely and woe-is-me about having no company, but once they come around my mind switches to ""Get the fuck out of my field of perception now please.""  I think I've always been somewhat depressed but around a year ago everything kicked into high gear... an intensity I've never really had to deal with before and for no apparent reason.  I don't think there is a point to life, but I logically know humans are supposed to be wired in such a way that we feel meaning in things and excitement about things.  The only real emotions I seem to have left are sadness and irritation at this point.  I've always had a pretty hedonistic philosophy about life overall.  Life should feel good, that's the only redeeming quality living has.  When your ability to find pleasure in anything disappears suddenly it all just becomes a relentless chore.  So after years of dealing with this mental illness shit-show I've decided I may as well go to the doctor and let them use my brain as a chemistry experiment with all the drugs they want to give me because it's clearly only getting worse leaving it alone and I don't have much left to lose."

Take note (literally or metaphorically) of what his concerns are with your solutions and find relevant information that would help him see the truth of the situation.   Why is he against you taking antidepressants?   He must have his reasons behind his discomfort towards antidepressants, find out what they are.   Why won't he change his mind?   A question I'm more curious about because in spite of his supportive self, he is against you doing recommended treatment methods and claims he would not change his mind about them. I am curious why.

depression,3dwzf2,ThrowawayJ10112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"Religion... is a tricky issue. The person inside me wants to say see a therapist and take medication in spite of his indiscretions, but clearly that can pose a threat to your relationship and create an unhealthy behaviour.   So instead, and this is just throwing it out there for thought, try sit him down and see what he thinks the solution to your problems could be. Sit him down and say something along the lines of, ""If its more than just a rough period, then what do you think we can do?""  I use 'we' instead of 'I', because the healing process becomes much more of a possibility when you work through it with someone you love and demonstrates that you don't only want to deal with you own problems but make sure he too is also handling everything fine going along on the ride with you.  If he comes up with (I forget the word) non-medically-proved treatments such as meditation or herbal treatments, keep your mind open to the ideas as it shows that he really is dedicated to helping you recover. Try them out if you wish, they may actually help. Different people have different reactions to those methods.  If he has no suggestions to add? Well in some ways this can work for you. You say;   I was diagnosed with this problem nearly 6 months ago and have been living with this for even longer. I want to rid this from my life so we can be together and both be happy. I have looked into ways to make me better and these are the best ways of letting me get better.   Perhaps one idea I could recommend is actually going together to see a religious leader at the [insert religious centre] he goes to.   (Using Christianity as an example because its the only religion I know a bit more than nothing about.) Go to a priest or the leader of the church and talk to them about how they believe you could sort out this problem. Maybe, and this is a definite maybe, they might say that in spite of it being against religious text, it is best that you do what you can to make you healthy. Or maybe even, they might say that something in the scriptures says that medicine isn't bad for you if it does you good.   (I'm really sorry if that last idea sounded terrible but the first part of it sounded nice in my head. Maybe if he heard therapy from a therapist as a suggestion from a religious leader at a church he frequents he might be more open to the option.)  I live in Australia and in my life religion hasn't caused many problems for myself or my family. I wish I could give more insight to the problem but I simply don't have the experience, but I will do what I can."

It feels like all the people close to me are dying. The only thing I've been working towards for the past three years is being taken away. What's the point of trying at all when nothing good ever happens and anything that matters to me is taken away?
depression,3dvwie,ctshame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:20:01 2015 UTC,I'm not going to lie to you everything will feel awful and it will feel like a struggle but its something you will overcome! Trying to keep this serious but I highly doubt death has a personal vendetta towards you and your loved ones. It's just the timing is all. As for school could you still graduate at some date? Let's say you dropped the program then what would happen? And the point of trying is for yourself to better yourself and if you can do that I'm sure you can probably also better the peoples lives around you. That's the point in trying!
depression,3dvwie,ctshame,2,Mon Jul 20 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"It's not so much I think death has a vendetta against me. Just that nothing ever works out. The worst always happens. Anything good gets taken away and bad things just keep coming. I had a very traumatic childhood and even since then, all these horrifying events keep happening.   And I am supposed to be beginning my first year of classes in a month. So if they don't grant me the deferment to begin classes next year, I'll have to give up my spot in the class.

depression,3dvl23,just4fun966,3,Sun Jul 19 22:05:05 2015 UTC,"Overall, quite positively.  I found it most helpful to both them and myself to frame my problems in a way they could understand. Rather than going into details about the clinical side of depression I spoke more of how I was feeling and made sure to let them know none of that had anything to do with them and that I was very grateful to have them in my life.  Those who have never experienced deep levels of emotional suffering or who deal with it by burying it will have the greatest difficulty understanding and may not be as compassionate in their response.  Those who have experienced it and found their own ways of coping and healing will be your greatest allies, though keep in mind that it's a  two way street and you will want to be open to helping them in their times of need - when the strength is there.   Everything in between is the playground of what I call ""fair-weather friends"". These are good friends in good times, but when bad times hit you they are the first to disappear. They're not bad people by any means and often put distance to any suffering so as not to risk feeling it themselves. By showing them compassion in their times of trouble they may come around to return it themselves. They may not. But that's the deal with compassion: it's a gift that is given with no expectation of anything in exchange, at that time or in the future. It is its own reward.  You will have friends who stick with you to the best of their ability - everyone has experiences their own troubles and pains which can limit their capacity to help - and others who may be less present when you're down.  It's the ones who react with abuse that will be the ones you'll need to drop. Fortunately I have only ever experienced that with my family members, of all people."

depression,3dvl23,lookingatwashington,2,Sun Jul 19 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"My pleasure :)  You may want to probe a little further to understand why you don't want to tell your family about how you're feeling. For a long time I believed that my silence in suffering was a means of protecting them and it took me a long time to realize that I was actually protecting myself from their neglect, abuse and guilt-tripping. They have their own deep wounds that prevent them from providing the compassion needed to even begin addressing mine in a positive manner. It's not that they don't love me, but more that their own misery keeps them from simply listening without triggering their pain. Each of them reacts differently, but in each case it ends up draining me.  You know your family better than anyone, so if you believe they are capable of showing you compassion it would be to your utmost benefit to confide in the one(s) you trust most on how you're feeling. As would be the case with friends, if they've found their own healthy ways of coping with the suffering that all people experience in life they will be able to hold your feelings and help you find ways of expressing and managing yours."

Its easy when i talk to my terapist about it cus she knows what i mean and can lead the conversation, but when i tell my friends and maybe my parents its me who has to tell what i feel and mean, and its hard, maybe it gets easier if i do it once.  The problem with telling my parants isnt that they have problems themself as far as i know, but they are getting a kid now very soon and im pretty sure they gonna have enough with that if their not gonna take care of my problems too. Besides i honestly dont feel the need to talk to them about it, even tho i might would help. So i guess it is to protect them. I can feel the Vibe i get from them whenever i do or say something thats not what they expect from me, wich doesnt make me want to tell them either."

They all had and still have great intentions, and they help me in any way they can and I appreciate that greatly.  My problem with it was that when I felt like I didn't deserve help, which is one of the more obvious symptoms of depression.  That is what, for me, made it excruciating to experience their sympathy.  I think that in the long run, having their support is what has been slowly pulling me down from the bottom.    On the other hand, just because of my background, my advice for families is to be wary and to properly evaluate the situation.  My parents found out on their own when I was relatively young, and it ruined a lot for me.  My parents didn't and still don't understand my personality because we are so different.    I guess it sum it up, friends most definitely can help, but caution should be exerted with parents because they can react unpedicatbly."

People that are alike, gravitate towards each other.. Maybe you are more like them than you give yourself credit for. I have been there, and wondered the same thing. Why I deserved friends like them. But in time hopefully, you will have conversations with them, and meet new people who are similar, and maybe from these things realise the things that give you value as well.

I can do minor stuff, like tweak Gameshark codes, but anyone can do that."

Part of my problem is I want to know all of it. 3D, 2D, Gameboy, Dreamcast, all, but there's just too much. You have a focus. You concentrate on one/two types of genre with one type of engine.  How did you learn to make games?"

We're only allotted a certain amount of time with our loved ones on this earth, gotta let them know how much you love them while they're here. There's a quote, not really sure who it's from but it goes ""dont cry because it's over, smile because it happened."" Be thankful for the moments you shared. Hey, being a camp counselor is pretty dope too, Ive been both a camper and counselor. I know I looked up to a lot of the counselors when I went. I bet you got campers who feel the same. You can shake this funk maximus. Just keep your head up."
depression,3dvjis,JibbyJabbaJumpShot,2,Sun Jul 19 22:34:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for the kind words. The summer is almost over and my grandad isn't too great. I just hope he makes it a little longer. Its hard for me to leave work. I could bit honestly I don't want to see him in his current state. He has his good days and his bad. I do love my job. The kids give me a reason to power through it. That quote sums up my feelings for camp. Thank you.
depression,3dwwn0,Jeffthebassplayer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"You may be able to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist about your depression. If that isn't an option and you trust someone around you enough then you might be able to share some of your feelings with them while avoiding the knowledge of your co-workers. If that won't work for you then please respond to this or pm me and I will try and get someone for you to talk to.  In regards to what to do with yourself, that is a rather personal thing so I can't help much but I found it effective to bounce ideas around in my head or off of someone for a goal to achieve. I don't know you so I can't say much about what you would enjoy doing, but perhaps some of these topics (or a further pursuit in one of them) might interest you: music or possibly learning additional instruments, martial arts, weight lifting, theater work, writing, photography, painting or other artwork, gardening, video games, or tinkering with electronics.   I hope that at least some of this is helpful, and good luck to you."

If they won't listen to you then that would be a very bad idea. I couldn't speak to my parents about such things so I would try talking to the friends that I had when I needed help. You may want to do the same. A word of warning though, only speak to those you can trust to not gossip.   If that isn't an option for you then you might be able to talk to a counselor or psychiatrist depending on what part of the world you are in and your situation with your country's education system. If you are employed, your employer may be able to help in some manner. Best of luck to you."
depression,3dwv5a,AveLucifer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:35:20 2015 UTC,Maybe you're just talking to the wrong people.
depression,3dwv5a,AveLucifer,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:56 2015 UTC,I don't know who could possibly be the right people and that kind of scares me
depression,3dwv5a,AveLucifer,0,Mon Jul 20 05:51:34 2015 UTC,Well the correct answer here would be to talk to a mental health professional. But why not talk to us here for a start?
depression,3dwv5a,u97LRnA3KP7Gky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:54:49 2015 UTC,I'll try it. Just want to say thank you though for responding because you didn't have to
depression,3dwv5a,AveLucifer,0,Mon Jul 20 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"It's ok. I've never seeked professional help either myself, but I felt better talking to people here."
depression,3dwv5a,RavioliRachel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to explain it but I feel weird seeking help, like even though I'm sad, my problems aren't important enough for help."
depression,3dwv5a,RavioliRachel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry for butting in here, but this sounds like the reason why I found it so relieving to receive a depression diagnosis. It was confirmation that the problem is real and that I need help."
depression,3dwv5a,RavioliRachel,0,Mon Jul 20 06:37:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone's problems are too unimportant. Besides, when you visit a professional you're basically paying for their time. You deserve that time."
depression,3dwv5a,RavioliRachel,0,Mon Jul 20 06:08:11 2015 UTC,"That's no good. If you don't communicate, no one can understand what's going on. Sure, many people won't, but not everyone is like that. The only reason why humans have gotten as far as they have is because they communicate so well.   When you don't say what's on your mind, the thoughts eat away at you. I don't know why, but when I talk about some things that have been bothering me, I work out a solution, whether the other person helped or not.  I know there's not a straight solution to being depressed, but talking to others that will listen will help. You just have to take that chance."
depression,3dwunb,whoami232323,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"Might I suggest expanding upon this? Tell us what you're going through, right here. If you're comfortable, that is. But you're protected by anonymity here, and I know that may seem terrifying, but it can be rather liberating. What I'm driving at with this is - post everything you're feeling right now. Post what you're going through. Get it all out there, and when people see it all, if they can relate or feel they can help, a good bunch of them will. But if you still feel you want to speak one-on-one, I can't guarantee I'll be the best of help, but I can at least guarantee that I will a) listen, and b) tell you whatever I feel comfortable telling you. But from experience, I know it's good to just get it off your chest. So I'm here if you need me."
depression,3dwunb,EchoesInTheMist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:06:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. Edited my original post and it did help, albeit briefly, to jot down what I was thinking and feeling."
depression,3dwunb,EchoesInTheMist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:05:53 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize, you're going through some really rough times. Watching someone you love sink into the depths of alcoholism is rough - or so I hear. From my wife. Like you, my father was an alcoholic, like his father before him. And, like my father, I found myself struggling with alcoholism for a period of time in my life. To this day, I still have trouble with it - I still drink, occasionally, but I'm not the 6-pack a night that I used to be. But even then, I still have trouble putting the bottle down from time to time.  But the sins of the father don't always translate to the son. It sounds like you've done very good so far. You have the strength to stop yourself before it goes too far - that's very admirable. People like me have trouble doing that, so when we hear of people like you, who can find a sense of control of that, it gives people like me hope. I'm sorry, but I don't know what to say about your -fathers- situation, but this what I'd like to say about your own - You're doing good. Coming here, getting it off your chest, that's a good step to take. Whenever you're feeling down, come back. Post again about what you're going through, because what you're going through is tough. Watching someone you love eat away at themselves, feeling like there's nothing you can do, it in turn eats at you. And if you don't get that out, then you risk suppressing it, and the more you suppress it, the more you run the risk of following in his steps. Talk to people. If you don't feel comfortable talking to friends irl, then like I said, come back here. Lurk. Comment. Whatever you need to do to help you through it, do it - you may even find other people who can relate to your situation, and then you'll have more people to talk to. But keep doing what you're doing - keep fighting. You're doing good so far, but that doesn't mean it's easy, and it doesn't mean you haven't suffered. Obviously, you have - you are. But keep fighting. You're worth the struggle."
