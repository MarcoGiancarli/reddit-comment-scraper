APStudents,3e3eig,DyrannosaurusRex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"oh god why  get a textbook, hopefully your school has them, otherwise amazon/ebay has them for like 10 bucks. campbell biology 6th/7th/8th editions are good. don't use the lessons to try to learn things, the lessons are going to be horrible like all flvs lessons. Only took ap microecon through flvs and it was an absolute nightmare. I learned everything the night before using ACDC econ. not even kidding, i found some kid's work on scribd and copied all of the assignments.   I wouldn't say that you have to know that much chemistry, chem 1 helps but it's not necessary after the introduction stuff.  use bozeman science on youtube if the class actually uses the 12(?) ap bio labs that the course has, that guy explains them very well. I think there are virtual labs, because I know there are with chem 1 and i think bio 1 on flvs.   god, good luck to you. I finished 80% of the course during spring break, hopefully you have better work ethic/more free time than i did.   there were kids who took it online in '13, they used campbell bio 8th edition and both got 4s on the ap test. small sample size, and they worked together, and took it during school in a computer lab. i don't know how many flvs classes you've taken, but i would recommend it if you have any idea about what you're getting into."
APStudents,3e3eig,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"Haha, I also took Micro through FLVS and also used Scribd to do all my quizzes and tests. I didn't think the class was half bad as I got 5.  Did you use CliffsNotes AP Biology ?"
APStudents,3e3eig,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"no i used princeton review, an ap review book from the textbook (8th edition campbell), and that's it  we only made it to chapter 17 out of 56 in the textbook in the class, skipping 11, didnt do any of the labs at all, and i used those review books in two days, princeton review is bad for bio  i only got a 3 on the ap test  still, campbell is a good textbook and bozeman helps with the labs"
APStudents,3e3eig,I_NEED_A_GF,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the AP Biology exam is a logic exam. You only really need to know the basics to pass it. However, you really have to understand cause and effect for many of the questions. Take at least two practice exams beforehand to make sure you the timing down - I couldn't finish all of the MC. You could probably be okay if you're familiar with the test format and question types and you have your reasoning down."
APStudents,3e076g,redsquare92,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:56 2015 UTC,"Do every single free response question and released multiple choice questions. The questions each year on the free response are very repetitive with the exception of #6, so practice makes perfect. My teacher taught up until January and did review stuff up until may. Your teacher might teach at a slower pace, so I encourage you to study ahead and do a few practice questions each day. There are a ton of practice questions online. If your're ever stuck, try using stattrek.com and youtube videos."
APStudents,3e076g,Naginichen,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"I took statistics, as a junior, but I know several people that took it as a sophomore. In my opinion, the most important part of the class is making sure to memorize the necessary formulas, conditions, and methods for tests. I do not know how your class is structured, but assuming it is similar to mine, you will spend about a quarter of the year on statistical inference. This is the most important part of the curriculum, combining all of the previous parts. If you get a good handle on inference, the AP exam is, while not easy, fairly doable."

APStudents,3dwrg0,zack7521,4,Mon Jul 20 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of old FRQs on the ap website. Take a bunch leading up to the exam, and use the scoring guide to see how you did."
APStudents,3dwrg0,schreiberbj,2,Mon Jul 20 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"This.  Do as many old FRQ's as you can.  Eventually you'll start to see the patterns that come up, and they'll all start to look alike.  Collegeboard tends to format questions in the same way year after year, which means that you can get to a point where no question will take you by surprise, look different or new in any way.  That is the key to success IMO."
APStudents,3dwrg0,Valveq0,2,Tue Jul 21 12:43:52 2015 UTC,"I'll just describe what I did, this may not work for you. I studied Mechanics and E&M with almost no starting physics knowledge (I was in AP Physics 1 concurrently) and managed to get a 5 on both.  First, I basically just got a textbook (University Physics by Young) and read and took notes on all of the relevant chapters. The book covers everything you need to know from mechanics and e&m. It took me about 2-3 months to go through all the material. After that I started to review using the Princeton Review book. I read all the chapters and did the practice questions and exams. Leading up to the test I just did random practice MC and FRQ that I found. By doing practice you will recognize the question patterns they use often."
APStudents,3dwrg0,Fgilan,4,Mon Jul 20 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"If you're good with mechanics and know calculus, you'll do fine on Physics C mechanics. I started studying 2 weeks before the test, and got a 5. All you need to do is make sure you know the derivative & integral relationships (although they are pretty intuitive..), know how to derive moments of intertia (again, simple if you were good at the 3D revolutions in calculus), and learn a bit about gravitational fields. Make sure you know your angular momentum and moment of inertia stuff well. The hardest part of the test is the time limit, to prepare for that, just do a bunch of practice tests that have been released. I did around 5 and you start to realize that the questions are super similar, and instantly know how to approach them.  For E/M, you will need to study more, since there is a decent amount of new content. I really shouldn't have procrastinated studying for it since I spent several all nighters learning it once I realized I didn't know shit. Viren's physics videos were my savior and there's no way I would have understood everything in time and gotten a 5 if it wasn't for him (apphysicslectures.com)."
APStudents,3dwrg0,Stupid_and_confused,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:01 2015 UTC,I have a question as well.  Are there any Physics C websites that help teach the curriculum?  The Physics Classroom helped me A LOT for the AP Physics 1 test.  But now that I don't have a website to help me I feel lost.
APStudents,3dwrg0,muradiron09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:02 2015 UTC,HyperPhysics can help you as sort of a reference for definitions and formulas.  Check out Walter Lewin's lectures on youtube for more of a complete course.

I've been reading it and it makes the concepts very easy to understand, explains where all the terminology comes from, and basically explains why things are why they are in calculus (it doesn't just tell you how to do something and expect you to treat it is fact, it shows you how to do it while explaining it). It doesn't cover all the material but it's definitely a good place to start."
APStudents,3dwe5b,Fgilan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"I would get a good textbook. ""Calculus, An Intuitive and Physical Approach"" by Morris Kline is good for an introduction to calculus because it explains things informally and focuses on intuitive understanding.

APStudents,3dwnq1,SadisticLemons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Somewhat, I think it's asking for 2 articles per branch and for each article it's asking for a paragraph on the constitutional power the branch is using and a paragraph on how the article discusses the use of this power.

APStudents,3dwax9,Luuuuuurrker,4,Mon Jul 20 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"I posted my regrets for APs here recently.   One of them was taking stats instead of Calc junior year.   Calc gets you out of so much more, and it's good to have those scores before entering senior year so you know exactly what is going on for entrance exams and class filling requirements. I would also recommend taking so language junior year if possible."

APStudents,3dwax9,schreiberbj,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:20 2015 UTC,Depends on what you want to study in college. Probably not a huge deal.
APStudents,3dwax9,ExtremelySexyMan,0,Mon Jul 20 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want to study in college. Personally, I took precalc sophomore year and then took a non-AP Calc class junior year and now (senior year) I'm taking AP Stats. I'm not looking to study anything math related in college, so I thought it would be better for me to take a less rigorous Calc class to have a baseline for a college course that I'll hopefully breeze through already knowing most of the curriculum. Stats is more relevant to what I want to study in college, so I'm taking that this year.  So pretty much, it depends what you want. I'd say if you want to go into something STEM related, take AP calc. If not, it's up to you. I personally hate straight math, and prefer more real world application, so taking a non-AP calc class was perfect for me, as it focused more on the application part."

Am I obligated to jettison a significant portion of the English language merely because your ignorance dismisses me as pretentious?  I'm absolutely cognizant of the fact that language usage does not necessarily correlate with one's level of intelligence. Not a single non-statistical element even comes close to determining it. You're the pompous one for calling me pretentious.  Never has somebody possessed the audacity to label me ""full of myself"" until today. Asinine."
APStudents,3dy86u,ophello,5,Mon Jul 20 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"Wow -- struck a nerve there, didn't I?   ""Acquaintances"" and ""friends"" are not synonymous.   Yes they are. In most cases, they're interchangeable.   The word ""sardonic"" implies cynicism, as opposed to ""sarcastic"", which is relatively equivocal in connotation   Actually, they're synonymous and can be used interchangeably. Yet again, you choose the more obscure word because it suits your arrogance.   Am I obligated to jettison a significant portion of the English language merely because your ignorance dismisses me as pretentious?   I never said you were obligated to do anything. I'm saying that when you write like that, you sound like a total choad and it makes people think you're full of yourself. Just helping you understand that. By all means, keep inflating your simple thoughts with meaningless vocabulary. It isn't fooling anyone.   Never has somebody possessed the audacity to label me ""full of myself"" until today.   And it's about time. Your posts are insufferable. And go easy with the italics. You might cut someone with all that edge."
APStudents,3dy86u,evilninjaz99,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm being simpleminded; not only is your reasoning elementary, but it's entirely incorrect. How else would I combat it?  Hmm. Do you know me? Of course you don't. So quit assuming judgement. Shall I italicize it for you?  People have complimented my literary ""eloquence"" before. Does it affect me? Does it bolster my ego? No. Because I am not a narcissistic asshole. And I'm metacognizant enough to say that.  But, regardless, it's occasionally pleasant to hear. You know why? Because I like the language, and I relish composition.  You know what? Arguing is futile. Yes, I still believe that your opinion is foolish. Nonetheless, this is supposed to be an innocuous subreddit. I sincerely apologize for the way I communicate, for it irrefutably perturbs you. Truce? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5OX7CO26c"
APStudents,3dy86u,ophello,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"And I'm metacognizant enough to say that.  metacognizant   Holy shit, if your head was any further up your own ass, you would be a klein bottle.  I was never offended. I just see too much of myself in you, and I learned that I was pushing people away by writing like that. It took years to realize that I was alienating people and painting a very poor picture of who I was. I wish someone had come along to point it out sooner. So, I'm paying the notion forward on behalf of my former self."
APStudents,3dy86u,evilninjaz99,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:47:15 2015 UTC,You almost sound sincere. (;  Alright. I'll take it into account.

APStudents,3dsxmz,Greenbackvv99xc,3,Sun Jul 19 03:44:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken Econ yet, but the consensus is that the test is easy if you take the class. As for APUSH, it is one of the more difficult tests/classes but very rewarding. I'm assuming you live in CT like me (I'm at McMahon) and I took the ECE class and the exam, as many of my peers did. As for prep, I would just pay attention in class, take notes, and buy a prep book or two (Barons, Kaplan, etc). PM me if you need more help!"
APStudents,3dsxmz,Dlue14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Nice, I'm at Sheehan! And I appreciate the feedback. Do you think I should still take the exam for APUSH just in case?"
APStudents,3dsxmz,Dlue14,2,Sun Jul 19 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"If you think you can manage it, I definitely would. I took STATS (5) and APUSH (4) my sophomore year and survived (barely). So it's definitely doable. I'm not sure whether you get credit for both ECE and the AP test, but doing both definitely can't hurt."
APStudents,3dsxmz,rgheite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"Junior year ( this past year) I took apush, stats, English, and apes. That was hell. Pulled 3's and 4's, but you can do it! :)"
APStudents,3dsxmz,ishabad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:57:15 2015 UTC,I took the ECE for Euro and AP for APUSH in the same year. They were equal in difficulty for me.
APStudents,3dsxmz,long218,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:08:34 2015 UTC,"I took ap gov and macro as one class and so I have one day for gov and the next for macro. My teacher made us remember all the graphs as summer assignment. Then he dump all materials in the first 2 months. I sleep for the rest of the year and still get 5. All you have to remember is the core concepts and as long as you can apply those core concepts into different situations, you are good.  Micro is harder on the other hand. There are less graphs but you have to know how to manipulate each graph to represent the given situation. Th concepts are a lot harder and you can't really use common sense to answer some of the questions. There are some overlapping material but not much. I was lucky there was no frq on labor or Lorenz curve so I got a 5 😁"
APStudents,3dsxmz,ethood1999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:51:23 2015 UTC,"Econ is generally pretty easy if you take the class. It's honestly just a bunch of graphs, and you have to memorize what causes shifts on the graphs, and how to manipulate the graphs to get information."
APStudents,3dsxmz,ApplePieTerrorist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:36:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy.  Source: 4s on Econ, 5  on APUSH"
APStudents,3dsxmz,lamatdroze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:28 2015 UTC,I took both Econ last year in my sophomore year and got a 5 in macro and 4 in micro. Studied alot of graphs though so be prepared to understands various charts and graphs. Good luck!!
APStudents,3ds9pi,Thybrantalope,9,Sat Jul 18 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"If your teacher properly teaches the concepts then you should be fine, because if you understand the concepts the test will be pretty easy. Teachers should have a better idea of how to teach the course this year.  Personally, the physics department at my school is pretty bad and the teachers only gave us plug and chug type problems the whole year. I managed to get a 5 though because I was self studying for Physics C, which mostly covers the Physics 1 material but goes more in depth."
APStudents,3ds9pi,Fgilan,7,Sun Jul 19 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"How much harder is Physics C, in your opinion?   Is Physics 1 worth it if it's just a simplification of actual physics (so I've heard)?"
APStudents,3ds9pi,OnlyGray,7,Sun Jul 19 00:45:56 2015 UTC,"Physics C is definitely much harder, but it's not impossible like some people make it seem like. With some extra effort the gap between Physics 1 and C Mechanics can be easily closed. E&M is a whole different story though, much harder than mechanics.  I still think Physics 1 is worth it if you can't take C yet. Of course things will be simplified, but it's still ""actual physics"". The basic concepts that mechanics is based on will still be presented, just with easier math. Learning the basic concepts will give you a good foundation to apply more complicated math when you take a higher class."
APStudents,3ds9pi,Fgilan,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm, alright. I'm guessing you enjoyed the material more in C? I'm not fond of the teaching model where something is simplified and later elaborated.   I can take C and next year would be my last chance too. Decisions, decisions..."
APStudents,3ds9pi,OnlyGray,4,Sun Jul 19 04:24:43 2015 UTC,I would take C if you have the option to take either one. The calculus involved in Mechanics is not hard at all so you should be fine even if you're taking calc for the first time concurrently.
APStudents,3ds9pi,Fgilan,3,Sun Jul 19 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the advice!"
APStudents,3ds9pi,OnlyGray,2,Sun Jul 19 17:16:12 2015 UTC,Where are you in your math classes right now? Have you taken Calc AB or BC?
APStudents,3ds9pi,ethood1999,4,Sun Jul 19 13:00:33 2015 UTC,"The exam is very conceptual, unlike Physics C, which is more centered around the math. I don't remember any actual calculations with numbers on the FRQ portion (there were some with variables). Thus, try to focus more on understanding the concepts and preparing yourself to apply them to various situations and less on memorizing formulas (even though that is still important). Physics 1 had the lowest rate of 5's in 2015 with 4.1%. I took 5 exams, and it was my only 4 :/. Best of luck :)"
APStudents,3ds9pi,brianlh9,4,Sat Jul 18 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"That being said, physics 1 concepts rely heavily on a solid mathematical understanding of concepts.   For instance: does a heavy object or lighter object with same coefficient of friction reach the bottom of a ramp first?  You can guess right, but without the right reasoning, based on mathematical concepts and proofs, you won't get credit for your answer.   I am very interested in seeing how they grade and scored these FRQs.   But if you are thinking of taking honors physics, chances are you should just go ahead and take AP 1"
APStudents,3ds9pi,PhascinatingPhysics,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:10 2015 UTC,Can you show an example of a conceptual question? I don't know what you mean by that
APStudents,3ds9pi,5414496,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:20 2015 UTC,"Concepts such as how to find Tension of hanging objects, the location on string with highest speed, the energy graph. You can do any of those question without having to do calculation as long as you know the concepts."
APStudents,3ds9pi,long218,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"I think /u/Fgilan explained it perfectly. There was such a low passing rate this year because of under-preparation, and CollegeBoard neglecting to release study materials. Next year, that won't/shouldn't be a problem, and I expect the passing rates to skyrocket, because for those who knew what they were doing and we're prepared, it wasn't a hard test."
