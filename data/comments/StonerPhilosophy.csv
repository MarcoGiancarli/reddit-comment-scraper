StonerPhilosophy,3dtkc9,Ensurdagen,2,Sun Jul 19 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you cjENTusBLAZE.  Allow me to tell you my relationship to philosophy re weed, it's probably similar to many experiences but I see you have a budding interest in philosophy and I'll be damned if /r/philosophy turns ANOTHER person off of the discipline; it's way more fun than they make it out to be if you're willing to lean in. Right off the bat, it should never be a contest, as some comments here complain about. If someone is lauding their knowledge over you like a sword of Damocles, delete that motherfucker from yer life.  Now, philosophy. Let's take the word apart: Philo-sophy. love (philo, as in audiophiles love hq music,etc etc) of knowledge (sophy, as in sophistry, sophisticated, etc etc). But clearly, there's a disconnect between the love present in the word and one's experience in say an intro level philosophy course that meets at 8am on Monday taught by a TA who'd rather be anywhere but with you, or interfacing with an a-hole on /r/philosophy who read Nietzsche in 11th grade and thinks he can wax lyrical about the self, etc etc. Recognize that your body, your mind are the basic  units of philosophy. Is the mind separate from the body or no? Plato and Aristotle discussed these things ~2000 years ago, but you wouldn't know it by sticking to /r/philosophy, a group mired in semantics and just plain boring questions. From what I've read on stonerphilosophy, the questions tend to circle around the idea of perception. I'd point you in the direction of Aldous Huxley's book ""Doors to Perception"" for a good stonerphilosophy-esque exploration of what material existence is. Huxley is best known for writing Brave New World and Island; dude dropped mad acid and other psychedelics in the 1930s, truly ahead of his time.  Another really cool thing to check out would be Shelly Kagan's Yale philosophy course on Death (all lectures available here on youtube). Highly accessible and sprinkled throughout with mindblowing nuggets to ponder for years.  Point is, if you are willing to look, you can find the stoner strands in disciplines of philosophy. If you stick around long enough, you may get a good professor or youtube instructor to take you through Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus, his meditation on language and existence. Walter Pater, a Victorian writer and thinker is who I return to often for inspiration: his most influential idea, at least for me, is the choice to ""always connect."" Everything is connected and when you start seeing that you begin to realize how the boundaries that man erects are mere illusions obstructing a good look at the things Huxley addresses in Doors to Perception.   Ultimately, interrogating your body and mind is the best place to start. Socrates said the unexamined life isn't worth living and after getting into philosophy myself I couldn't agree more. In contemporary society we miss something (I don't know what exactly, it resides about halfway between a spiritual and material thing I think though) in our endless pursuit o happiness for ourselves. Philosophy is a great way to try and figure out that missing piece. PM me for more detailed xplanations though, I'm just rambling now.  For other media to consume that will stimulate your philosophical feelers, check out the movie Waking Life(available on Netflix, I believe), or my personal favorite I Heart Huckabees and go from there! I hope you find what you're looking for as well as what you couldn't have even imagined.   edit: just realized I didn't mention my experience with weed as it relates to this. Smoking allows you to humor more ideas that you ever would when sober, for the most part. Relish that because as you can see if you've ever met someone over the age of ~45, that ability diminishes without dutiful practice. Always keep your mind open, but if you're posting on /r/stonerphilosophy you probably already know that :)"

Our host (The Earth) doesn't recognize us as a threat because we have always been part of it, just like the body's immune system can't target Cancer in some cases.    I think it was Joe Rogan on his podcast who made an observation about this.

Life in general ins't destroying the planet, though it does have an impact. I study science every day, respect nature, love to go for hikes and explore nature, so I respect that humanity and living things need to take care of nature. That said,  Earth is a very big place and life is a natural part of it's existence. It doesn't harm the planet any more than other phenomena like wind, rain, and sunlight. Certainly, specific organism can go out of balance - like humans who output too much C02 - but life is just a natural ""flowering"" of the planet when there's excess sunlight and chemical energy.   Humans, as well, are just another form of this complexity that naturally arose from the excess energy. We reproduce both ourselves and our ideas and focus on more than just our genetic blueprint.

What I mean by this is that people tend to differentiate between the effects of PCP and say, ketamine, or DXM, both also dissociatives. This being the case, I can't really speak to the effects of PCP myself, only having experience with a few other dissociatives. What I can say is that hallucinations are common, though typically not of the same variety as psychedelics. Dissociatives are physically numbing, and can make it hard to move around. Probably the most characteristic aspect are dissociative thought patterns, which can best be described as the opposite of associative thought, where each idea flows logically from the last.

And, I don't know, there are definitely people better suited or whatever for specific tasks/jobs and with those different tasks comes different levels of power, so people with less power are all ""wtf where's my power?

Anyways, I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do wish for communal peace, it'd be fantastic.

Then there is the question of what makes happiness so important to us?     Is it a ""moral""/mental thing that we identify and reason we want/should have? if so then we are only using thought to control thought so we can think and preceiv a certain way that so that the mind is satisfied, regardless of what the body needs    is it a physical state of being that allows out bodies to function with more ease, for us to not let our minds decide what our bodies need, but let out bodies decide what our bodies need and use the mind in a functional way to achieve such means.  Remember that the mind is part of the body, not a separate entity. If we define ourselves by our minds alone, it is no different than identify with ourselves with out toe. If we decide to identify ourselves by the entirety of out being (our physical body+what makes it [the environment+the way we interact with it+how that effects everything+what all matter is made of=what we are physically])  It is at this point i have forgotten why i was rambling and about what."

Otherwise, nerdy, creative, a multitude of other adjectives I'm sure.  The more soul-searching and introspection a person does, the more specific and numerous the adjectives become, applying individually to different aspects or quirks about yourself.  And it's never too late to add more. People can even work towards adjectives that don't currently describe them, but they want it to. Non-smoker, athletic, whatever.

StonerPhilosophy,3d16fm,lobsterclause,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think about this as a semantic issue: what are colors? You could argue that objectively speaking, colors do not even exist; what we refer to as 'colors' are simply relevant wavelengths of light. Why would our perception of reality be the full and only reality? However, we have evolved to notice differences between certain -- only a small portion of all -- wavelengths, and its experience we call 'color'.  So let's assume that colors only exist in your head: the world around you is actually void of it. Color (or rather, the sensation thereof) is made by your brain. Since no human has the same brain as another, we all experience color slightly differently: maybe the color experience that I have for a certain wavelength is completely different from yours. For instance, my sensation of 'red' is one that you'd experience at another wavelength (or not at all). You can't compare your sensation of color to mine. Your brain differs from mine, therefore it is possible that your visual experience is one that my brain is not able to produce. Or vice versa. So if this is the case, then I haven't seen all colors you have seen, which somewhat answers your initial question.  But just like the brain develops certain experiences for beneficial traits (e.g. distinguishing wavelengths), there surely is room for more potential sensory sensations. We just don't have the neural framework for those sensations to arise. To answer your question: I think that the question can be interpreted in at least two ways. ""Have any individual person seen all the colors he/she can see?"" Yes, because our brains haven't developed enough in order to see more colors. But when you ask ""have we seen all possible colors?"", then I'd argue that we have not, for our brain (of the human species as a whole) have the potential for many many more perceptual experiences; our brains and bodies just can't perceive them yet."
StonerPhilosophy,3d16fm,Werner96,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I believe we have not seen all possible colours.  The reason is because human can only detected the spectrum type: visible light whereas certain creatures like snakes can see non-visible spectrum like infrared and bees/butterflies can see ultraviolet. So do they see colours that we human could not detect or do they see it like the way some devices (camera) detect? Or do they see the same colour that we sees but in a different way like you have said, “maybe the color experience that I have for a certain wavelength is completely different from yours”.  What if those non-visible waves are still colours but since we cannot detect we see it as transparent just like high frequency sound that only certain creatures can hear but not us?"

StonerPhilosophy,3coh7s,QuintusVS,3,Thu Jul 9 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"Randomness is entropy. Non-randomness is order.   For example 10111010101111010101000100101001001110010100101010010101 Is randomness and entropy.  But 10101010101010101010101010101010101010 Is order.   With that in mind, realize this. The universe has more order today than it did immediately after the Big Bang. Things can be replicated and we can find patterns, which is a trait of order. So that means that everything isn't going from order to disorder, it's going from disorder to order which is something that should only be possible in an open system where energy is increasing. Where is this new order creating energy coming from? Some think it might be from the quantum realm with subatomic particles moving from states of probability to definite states, but we can't say for sure. Either way, our universe is increasing in order which means it is most likely a free will universe."
StonerPhilosophy,3coh7s,Not_Austin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"Can randomness exist without order? I don't think so. In a truly completely random system we could not differentiate one thing from another - this would be a property of order. Vice versa, a system with maximized order, all elements would be the same - we could not differentiate one thing from another. Not being able to differentiate anything from anything, isn't that a property we have at the big bang? If the order in the universe increases to a maximum we reach again a point before the big bang: a state of nothingness. Nevertheless this state of nothingness has accumulated the energy of a universe - so enough for a new big bang ;)  So we have a cyclical creation of universes. If you like that model with linear time that we all share.  Hope that makes sense somehow ;)"

On the large scale we can approximately outcomes with statistical models, but individually, we just don't know. It's random. And that randomness leads to endless possibilities. I am definitely not a statistician, but I doubt there are many perfect models outside of a one sided die.   Now consciousness truly bothers me. But for me, it not because of randomness.

The brain is just another organ, and we give it too much importance.  This is one of the purposes of meditation and psychedelics, to quiet the mind so we can come in contact with the powerful energies in the body.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system  The body is capable of amazing insights: bliss, kundalini, sexual, subtle energies, and is a mechanism for achieving awareness.  Try this - take off your shoes, feel the energy coming through your feet as you walk on mother Earth..."

Was it your feet, hands, things you see, things you hear and imagine, strenght of those things are mostly limited by barriers you have set in your mind, to not even dare to try to pursue those feelings more deeply with your mind, enjoy and feel things as much as your mind lets you, barriers you face were build by you."

It's vitally important for stoners to understand that there are several types of mind.  We have a brain, and we have mind that's divided up into several types of activity, and lastly we have MIND, which as I said is not even localized in our bodies.  Here's another trick:  Hold your breath.  Keep holding.  More.  Does mind help you there?  In other words, body keeps the breath - not mind.  As I said before, don't give too much credit to the mind; it often lies, it gets confused, it's limited in scope, and mind keeps us in ignorance of true-reality (where there is no mental activity, ego, observer, or interpretation)."

StonerPhilosophy,3caafb,StonerMeditation,2,Mon Jul 6 15:53:40 2015 UTC,I can see this. The pain you feel is only the minds interpretation of the event. Whether that be physical or emotional.

When you start to understand the power it has and how thoughts and idea generate within it you start to see how experiences like these are very much possible.  Thoughts do not pop up randomly, there is always a cause and reaction kind of reason for every thought you manage and when you  see this you also understand how it is like a double edged sword, thoughts spiral down from a singe seed to major complicated thoughts, if you plant negative seeds you will end up with a more or less bigger negative thoughts.  First you probably thought about the idea that someone was behind you just for gigz and laughs but then you started to dig deeper into that feeling, trying to imagine the fear you would have and hence they became your reality, like you emphasized with the concept of the idea too deeply :)  Then again, understanding that is a great thing if you manage to focus on positive things."

StonerPhilosophy,3c367e,Ebtn,4,Sat Jul 4 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"I know right? Gladly, but everything will be spoilers. I repeat, almost everything below are spoilers.  Main villain and his goal  So let's call this villain The Master. He is a master warrior who's part of group that balances the forces of ""light"" and ""dark"" in the world (think Star Wars' light and dark). He ended up falling to darkness, wishing there was more darkness in the world and also desiring the source of all the light in the world called Kingdom Hearts. To fulfill this goal he needs more power.  The Master's method  First he needs to get a new body. He wants to make someone fall to darkness so he can take over his body and mind. In this game, that happens both figuratively and physically. The particular darkness he manipulates people with is anger, rage, greed, and lust for power. He sets his eyes on a strong student warrior. Let's call this student Mr. Naive. Mr. Naive want to prove himself as a warrior and feels bitter and inferior that he can't. Mr.Naive feels Darkness inside him and fears that fact. The Master manipulates him into believing darkness will give him the power he seeks. Master did this by using his Lackey to force Mr.Naive to use darkness to ""save"" The Master from a hostage situation, hence sowing the first seed of darkness. Lackey has inherited the same dark will as Master and does what The Master wants so he also can get power. Lackey will show up later.  The Master's will vs the 1st generation of warriors  Mr.Naive and friends eventually realize The Master's plan. Mr.Naive uses his darkness to beat The Master. Mr.Naive stops his plan but before The Master dies he takes over Mr.Naive's body using the darkness inside Naive. This was incredibly easy for the Master. Naive had already sacrificed his will and personality for dark will. Because Naive's dark will is the same as The Master's except weaker, The Master easily dominated Naive's original will.  So now Naive has been overtaken but Master has not won yet. Naive  and friends beat The Master so hard he got an amnesia. The force of the final battle transported him to a kind light-and-dark-scientist's home and he became his apprentice. Happy ending? Nope. Lackey finds him and reminds Master of his dark will.  Master's will vs Scientist  The Master now tried to get more power and darkness through experiments as Naive stopped his original plan. The Scientist that saved him objected. Master's experiments were inhumane. Scientist forbid them but that didn't matter because The Master had already manipulated the other apprentices into desiring darkness, spreading his dark will further. The Master and the apprentices lost control of the Darkness in their last experiment. The darkness not only engulfed the Masters and apprentices but the whole world. This split the  apprentices and people engulfed by Darkness into two halves. One half was void of personality and one half was full of darkness. The dark halves were mindless, heartless monsters. These fed on people's light and also turned them into heartless monsters, indirectly spreading The Master's will. The Master's dark half, however,  didn't just turn into a heartless monster but a fully aware one. We'll go through what disaster DarkMaster's caused before VoidMaster.  DarkMaster's will vs the 2nd generation of warriors  DarkMaster being really drunk on darkness now completely forgets his desire for light. He now desires eternal and infinite darkness by controlling the source of all dark. His plan is to seduce every minor villain in the world with darkness and boy does he succeed. They think he's giving them power, but he just wants them to turn into controllable, heartless monsters that spread darkness. This includes tempting Naive's student who has the same desire, to use dangerous power to prove himself useful, as Naive had. Naive's student falls to darkness and has to fight that before he can rejoin the fight against DarkMaster. The other warriors eliminate the darkness in the world and eventually defeat DarkMaster. The warriors have no idea of the history of the Master.   VoidMaster's will vs the 2nd generation warriors  After defeating DarkMaster, this mysterious group called The Organization XIII shows up in front of the heroes out of nowhere. It consists of 13 people that have lost their personalities after The Experiment. This group controls all the other Void personalities but have more intellect than the average Void personality. Their leader says their goal is to retrieve all Void-beings' personalities. The Organization spreads darkness to retrieve their personalities, but the warriors still doubt if they should stop then. To retrieve their personality and gain their feelings back seem like a noble goal. But where is VoidMaster? Oh, he's their leader. The other 12 members decided to follow him as they were the original apprentices in The Experiment. The warriors still don't know of The Master's past but decide to stop The Organization and Voidmaster as they are causing too much darkness in the world.   The Master's will is back  When you defeat someone's void-half and dark-half with light (like the warriors do) the original being returns. So The Master and The Organization members are back and his real plan as VoidMaster did in fact succeed. His plan for The Organization wasn't to retrieve personalities or feelings. He knew that humans void of personality eventually grows new ones when they come in contact with the environment. He just grew back his first. So the real purpose of The Organization was to find 12 strong people that would not only conform to The Organization's rules but to actually become other Masters. You can even see this in their face and eyes. This is how Lackey's face looked back then. This is him now. The Master achieved did this by having everyone in The Organization follow his beliefs, lifestyle, and dangerous exposure to darkness, while promising they'd get their old lifes back. He now has the manpower he always wanted to take on the warriors of light. The cosmic joke, however, is that the will to control light has existed in humans as long as light has. The Master is just some guy who got tempted by reading historical attempts of this. All of this has happened before."

Does nobody else realize that we've mapped the entire human genome, are mapping and understanding the inner workings of the brain more every day, and are on the cusp of creating a true AI (see Google Deep Mind)?  With the right funding on the right research, all of the fields related to cell death, and closing the gap between the digital and physical worlds, man could probably be immortal before most people on the planet right now die.

StonerPhilosophy,3c367e,Kabuthunk,2,Sat Jul 4 14:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to strongly disagree with this statement. All that they care about is that their family line... their name continues controlling forever.   I believe your statement is actually compatible with what I have said. The key appears to be in the interpretation of the pronoun ""they"". I was not using it to refer only to their physical bodies, nor just to the mind that identifies with their bodies, but rather, to their controlling thoughts which live on in their children as well. The rulers have usually picked their most obedient child, the one who most accepted their own point of view as true, to be their successor.  Additionally, ""they"" can also refer to the perception of them, through their name. ""They"" that is the original person who actually dies, continues to control via proxy through the people who they have deemed the best copies of them. Thank you for pointing this out, as I hadn't thought of this bit while I was writing the original post.  So, now I've provided an interpretation which connects my idea to yours. Do you have anything more to say about this? (It might still not match your ideas.)  Now I will read the rest of your comment.   If they cared about immortality in any direct way whatsoever, they would be pumping their billions upon billions of dollars into cutting-edge medical technology, stem-cell research, computational neural networking, and further entwining man and machine.   They have actually done this throughout history. They care both about physical immortality and idea-ical immortality. They want to be remembered, and to have their control stretch as far as possible into the future after their physical deaths.   But no, the next quarter profits are far more valuable than personal immortality to them. All they care about is that they have theirs until they die in opulence from old age, and then pass their legacy to their heir. It's the science-minded that want immortality.   That is a good point, I think. Though people have long been obsessed with actually obtaining immortality, none yet have succeeded, and I think that perhaps some people have lost hope in it, have settled for physical mortality. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if the immortality dream has something to do with the massive amounts of funding that the US government is currently giving to brain research. There is a balance between short term and long term spending. In the short term, people want to use their money so that they can control things, while immortality is strictly a long term goal at this point in time, at least as far as I know.  Thank you for your thought provoking reply. I've added a footnote to help clarify one of the things that you addressed."

I apologize, the issue particularly annoys me, and I jumped the gun on my reply there :P  In either case, I definitely think along the same lines, and it's that they're passing their ideas and ideals along, and THAT'S what has become immortal to them.  A mere thought, which could vanish as quickly as a gust of wind.  It's no wonder they fear losing ultimate control so much, that's literally the only thing they have to hope for at this point.  From a completely self-serving standpoint... I'm pretty sure the history books will be painting them in a far, far worse light over the years.  History is written by the victors and all that, but we're now in the age of history being written as it's happening.  The internet and its global communication have created a situation for the first time in history where the timeline of virtually any event will be accurately recorded, as it happens.  It may be obfuscated or biased by victors... the ones controlling the bought and paid for mass media... but to those smart enough, and who know where to look, the truth can always be found.  And more and more people are beginning to demand the truth.  Even the Roman empire fell, as have all of the dynasties in China.  I have no idea why the elite think that this empire is going to last forever.  Blinded by greed and power.  No matter, their empire is in the process of crumbling as we speak.

I keep saying the system is mathematically unsustainable... nobody ever believes me.   Part of the problem is that many people are always predicting that it's going to collapse by a particular deadline. Yet it dies slowly, and the deadlines pass without any cataclysms.

StonerPhilosophy,3c2dp3,tyengz,3,Sat Jul 4 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Part of this phenomenon is caused by the following fact:  We are prediction machines. (We are also other things as well, but those are not relevant to what I'm saying here.) Thus, our minds often think things just before they happen, as a way of telling us that the available evidence suggests that it is about to happen.  The causality here can then be mistakenly read backwards; rather than thinking that we predict the event because it is likely to happen, one may also be inclined to think that these things happen because we think about them just before they happen.  This type of logical fallacy is a symptom of how we, as prediction machines, function. There is a heuristic that we use, that is:  ""Temporal correlation implies causation.""  Using this heuristic, we infer that, if one type of event consistently occurs before a second type of event, that events of the first type are causing the events of the second type.  This heuristic fails when we apply it to prediction machines, because predictions, by their very definition, always occur before the events that they are predictions of, despite having no causal influence on the events.    That said, our predictions also do have causal effect on reality. This is because, as well as being prediction machines, we are also planning machines, designed to take actions such that our predictions end up being correct. (A plan and a prediction are often one and the same thing, a plan being an intended prediction, and a prediction being a resignation to a particular plan.)"

(although if you go into special relativity more, you actually can't travel as much along the spatial dimensions as you want, since there's a universal speed limit of ~3*108 m/s , you're actually limited to your 'light cone' for what parts of spacetime you can experience."

In the short term you can influence the result, but in the long term it doesn't matter WHO is throwing the coin. The result is predetermined. You, as the subject, are irrelevant. Then expand this argument to life itself...get it?  In other words, it doesn't matter WHO is doing the THING...just that the THING is HAPPENING."

What I find interesting though, is that many people see this as pointing toward the conclusion that consciousness doesn't exist, when it makes just as much sense to follow the logic the other direction, and claim that consciousness, in some form, is inherent in the entire universe. This, panpsychism, is where my line of thinking has taken me, because, quite simply, I know my consciousness exists because I am currently experiencing it. So rather than say that ""consciousness is an illusion"", I think it'd be more accurate to say ""our identification with a certain form of consciousness is an illusion"", and all matter has an awareness, but it completely different forms. As I've heard it said ""if the mind is merely a complex arrangement of matter, than matter is a simple arrangement of mind."" In any case panpsychism goes completely against our common sense, but, fits very comfortably within naturalism and non-dualism.  TLDR: ""consciousness doesn't arise because it is inherent"""

Like maybe, by wearing clever shirts you are supposed to be representing yourself as a clever person, and by doing so *actually*  making yourself a clever person. And then you realize geeky t-shirts are trash, a way of representing yourself to a subculture that isn't really that special. Advertising your ""nerdiness"" seems as nerdy as the Big Bang Theory or tumblr Harry Potter ""geeks"".  Clothes are way of choosing your own representation. A way of focusing and picking elements from your ""true self"" to share with the world, while neglecting other elements. Wearing fedoras and goth stuff or whatever is a way of trying to advertise as something. Fedora is obviously aping the whole respectable gentlemen thing, dressing goth is a way of pretending to be anti-conformist/cool/special.

StonerPhilosophy,3b5w3n,HanSoHigh420,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"In Finnish language the word for Aurora is ""revontuli"", literally ""fire of the fox"". In Finnish mythology, firefox was a fox with shiny black or silver fur and the fur could be used as a non-burning light source. When the foxes ran among the trees and with each other, their furs created sparks which then illuminate the sky, creating ""fire of the fox"" to the sky.  These myths have been seen as an explanation also for static electricity and sparks created when soft fine fur is rubbed. Like when you take your woolen shirt off over your body, there are sparks and electricity. Finns hunted foxes for fur trade, so furs of good quality created static electricity with their smooth texture. They thought there might be some super rare super smoothy shiny silky fox out there which created a lot of sparks with its smooth fur. This was called the firefox and the aurora are the light of its sparks."

StonerPhilosophy,3b34pl,knave84,3,Thu Jun 25 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"Free will and determinism are ideas I've been struggling with quite a bit lately.  I've been reading (and listening to) a lot of Alan Watts and I fully grasp and believe in the idea of an interconnected universe.  Ultimately, to me, this leads to the idea of determinism.  But Watts often comes back and says that we aren't just something being pushed around by the universe, we are as much pushing as being pushed, and I understand this too.  So I have been thinking about this paradox in other Wattsian terms, that the universe is rife with paradoxes, but that's because our intellect breaks down and separates things which are unbreakable and inseparable.  We both have free will and everything is determined, these are merely opposite ends of a single unified curve.  It is no more paradoxical to hold both of these views simultaneously than it is to understand that something can be both a particle and a wave.  Any further digging into explaining this fact is to allow the intellect to again use relentless logic to break things down and separate them.  TL;DR the universe is a web of inseparable interconnectedness.  You would not be the you that you are now if the things happening on the opposite end of the planet weren't happening the way they are happening.  You would exist, you'd just be different, and that's alright.  The same holds true of the entire universe.  What does that mean for free will?  Fuck if I know."

It might even become a requirement to function in the society of the future.   There are dangers though. I hope that it will lead to a greater connection between people and not the opposite. It would be sad if people were even further ""compartmentalized"" than we are today.  The number of people living alone today is greater than ever and I fear that is not going to change. Maybe living alone will be the norm, staying at home at all times physically while socializing in great virtual worlds.  These kinds of entertainment will take up more and more of our time as technology advances and jobs become scarcer. The tendency is here already. There are an enourmous amount of people working in entertainment today. Not creating any real value (food, shelter and such) other than distraction. I am not sure how I feel about it."

Our consciousness is made up of the same atoms our physical being is. Atoms that come from the universe. When we die the energy just goes back into the universe. Maybe a similar line of thought is how they came up with reincarnation?  Check out this quote from De Grasse Tyson, he's much more eloquent.   ""Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically.   We are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us."""

I know when we talk about these things, semantics becomes a bit of a pain since language isn't set up to discuss things from this perspective.  BUT, the energy doesn't 'go back into the universe,' it never left (I feel like you understood that, but I wanted to clarify it for others).  We are an expression of the universe from inside of the universe.  We, each of us, are the here-and-now of the universe at each of our individual here-and-nows, experiencing the universe from within.  Within and inside are strange ways to describe it as well, since if the universe is everything and there's nothing outside of the universe, how can anything be inside of something without an outside?  Instead, allow me to re-phrase it: we are all the universal here-and-now."

StonerPhilosophy,3asl28,Retlaw1995,7,Tue Jun 23 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"To me, color and wavelength are not the same. It is like the old riddle about the falling tree.   If a tree falls when noone is around, does it make a sound?  Just like the movements of the air around the tree are not sounds until someone hears them, light does not have color until someone sees it.  I would argue that light is just light and wavelenght is just wavelength until it is registered by the pigments in our eyes and our optical cortex gives it an appropriate ""label"". This label is what we feel or experience as color.   Color is thus only in our minds, nothing has any color at all until we look at it, and then it only has color for us. We are the color in a sense, as it only exists in our conciousness and what are we if not our minds?"
StonerPhilosophy,3asl28,Jumbojanne,3,Tue Jun 23 10:25:15 2015 UTC,"Just like the movements of the air around the tree are not sounds until someone hears them, light does not have color until someone sees it.   Does this support the argument that in the absence of perception/consciousness, the universe is devoid of what we refer to as 'experience,' color, sound, taste, smell, and feeling?  And does that mean the reality around us is merely created in our brains, as they are the receptors that create these sensations (to take what you said about color further)?  What does that mean for the reality of the universe?  To be honest, I agree with you, I'd just like to hear you expand upon the idea :)  And I'd like to add, I've run into your comments a few times now and I always like them.  Definitely some good insights."
StonerPhilosophy,3asl28,philosophers-stoner,3,Tue Jun 23 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"I would say that reality exists in an objective fashion but it is probably not possible to really undererstand or interpret reality without distorting it in some way. It seems to me that the distortion is what makes it experience in some sense.  So our experience is just a small, distorted fraction of reality and also just a miniscule sample of all possible experience.  A dogs view of the world is most likely very similar to ours but extremely different in some key areas. A dog will experience a whole world of smells with subtle variations and value we only get a small glimpse of, while we have language that the dog will never understand the nuances of. There are most likely an enourmous number of ways such as these, to experience reality and confer values to it, like beautiful or ugly, tasty or gross, pleasant or painful.   So, what we experience is determined by our senses and how we process those senses in our brains. If the brain is different, reality is interpreted differently by it, even if the senses are the same.  The reality we are familiar with could be called an illusion but it would be more accurate in my mind to call it a simulation or model.   This model is what helps us find food and other things necessary for survival but does in no way adequatly describe reality if one is very observant. Quantum mechanics with its concepts of time dilation and such are prime examples of how our intuitions are very false.  And also, thank you for the compliment, it really means a lot to me."

When he's done thinking over this problem... we're gone.   Our thoughts, emotions, are the construct of the consequences of our past actions and interactions graduated by their germanity to the present moment.

StonerPhilosophy,3adl0l,emn234,18,Fri Jun 19 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"I (try to) take a Buddhist approach. Work on removing desire and attachment. Focus on doing/being good. Realize that our eventual demise only scares us because we're attached to this world and the pleasures it brings.  Not to say death doesn't wig me out, too. I'm 25, I don't want to think about death more than I have to. Just, don't let the fear of death turn into a fear of living, otherwise, you'll have wasted this one life already dead."
StonerPhilosophy,3adl0l,Tru-Queer,17,Fri Jun 19 12:29:45 2015 UTC,"Love.  Fear cripples consciousness, and fear is the source of unconsciousness, that is why without transcending fear no one can attain to full consciousness.  But what is fear?  Fear is awareness of death without knowing what death is.  Fear exists in the gap between you and your death, and if there is no gap, no space, then there is no fear.  Do not think of death as something outside you because it is not. And do not think of death as something in the future, because it is not.  Death is within you, because death is the other side of life. Life cannot exist without death; they both belong to the same energy as positive and negative poles.  So do not identify yourself with life –because you are both.   The identification with life creates the gap.  And death has nothing to do with the future – it is always here and now. Every moment, it is. And when one ceases to regard it as something outside oneself and, so to speak, draws it into his consciousness and assimilates the idea of it, one is completely changed.  He is in all truth born again. And then there is no fear because then there is no gap.  One has to go through the very awareness of death to reach deathlessness. The thrust of death goes deep but cunningly the mind goes on evading it.  Don’t evade it,  don’t console yourself –  any kind of consolation is a suicide.  Let yourself completely feel the wound of death: wake up and live with it!   This will be hard but revolution always is.  Death is, it is there always, but we forget about it. Every day death is there, every moment.   Life is a dual journey: one journey is in time and space, the other is within oneself. The first ends in death, the second in deathlessness. The second is the real journey because it takes you somewhere. Those who take the first journey as it, waste their lives. The real life begins the day you start the other journey.  To come close to oneself is to be reborn – the principle of being twice born is just this.    So die right now. This very moment. Your past? Gone, it doesn't exist anyway. Your future? Just thoughts in your head. Everything you think you are, every aspect of you.. erased. A void, a nothingness... this is where you started, this is your very core. The beginning and the end are where the line meets with itself to form a circle.  Say to life: What can you do to me? I want nothing! And say to death: What can you do to me? I have already died! Then you will be truly free because unless one is free of life one can never be free of death. And when one is free of both one knows that life which is eternity itself."

StonerPhilosophy,3adl0l,uncooperativecheese,5,Tue Jun 23 03:37:16 2015 UTC,"I personally like to think of it from a 7 billion people point of view. There are hundreds of religions in this world and to them they are all right and to everyone else they are wrong. I am not religious in any way but if you talk to people who are religious they all share the same thing, faith. All you need is faith in the fact that you're going to be fine. Nobody has ever died and told anyone otherwise. I personally like to think that whatever you think is going to happen to you when you die is going to happen to you. So if someone thinks they're going to heaven they'll go to 'their heaven' or if they're sure they're bad enough to go to hell they'll end up in 'their hell'. I have faith that i'll end up in 'my heaven' even though I am not religious. However if nothing happens, how will I know otherwise. Either something will happen and I will know, or something will not happen and I won't. I have faith that I'm going to be fine with either one. Everyone who has died before me has had to be."

Basically he describes what it means to be ""Dasein"", which he defines as the type of existence that humans have -- but for all intents and purposes it is applicable to any sentient being. This existence in characterized by our being ""thrown"" towards death. It is a fundamental aspect of our existence that in every moment of our lives we are falling towards our eventual deaths. For him, this helps us put into perspective that our eventual deaths -- that event which is completely personal, indefinite, and is essentially the impossibility of future possibility -- follow a life of possibility.   Death is something that is a necessary part of our existence, but it helps us see that our lives our full of possibility until that point. It is up to us to take charge of that possibility while one still can."

If not, I'll just settle for the DMT released by my brain.  There is no reason to be afraid of Death or whatever comes later, after all, it is one of the very few certainties in Life which in itself is full of nothing but uncertainties. Why then should one be afraid one's own demise?  We lose ourselves every time there is an end to our Curiosity that makes Life worth the ride. Death satisfies that thirst of ours, provides an answer for the innumerable questions we are riddled with in Life. We go beyond just being ourselves, we transcend the limitations. Thrive on the undying Curiosity that it creates, the answers to which shall only be known after one passes on. The Fear vanishes only to make way for pure Fascination.  Death is by no means an end, merely another beginning.  I'll leave this quote by the late great poet Morrison for you to brood on, hope it helps: Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws."

One step further, just surviving long enough to procreate is good enough for evolution.  With regards to OP, he seems to think of evolution as some willful entity, which it is not (or at least it is of such utter complexity that we can't dare to guess its 'goals').  Evolution is the natural consequence of proliferated gene diversity in the face of (typically) environmental stresses.  We (humans) are currently creating the next mass extinction (oh, hello global warming).  And what always follows a mass extinction?  Population explosions and increased diversity.  Which are inevitably followed by mass extinctions.  Which are subsequently followed by diversification.  It's a cycle and to imagine that we've beaten it is to not understand your history.  We may be merely a tool in this cosmic life cycle.  Also, I disagree with OP's assumption that humans wield the power to annihilate all life on the planet.  Natural disasters far greater than anything man wields currently have bitch slapped life on this planet in the past and it has recovered (though maybe we ourselves are a natural disaster from the perspective that nature created us, but I would still hold to the premise that life will continue).  I don't think that we have the means to seriously affect most of the microbial life and certainly not to the point of extinction.  To quote Jurassic Park: 'Life... uh... finds a way.'"

StonerPhilosophy,3a9ccw,onthemoveactivist,2,Thu Jun 18 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"If by life you mean most plants and animals (large multicellular life), then you are correct. However, that is only a small fraction of the life present on earth today. Microbial life is protected under the ground, like way deep down. You would have to remove and sterilize ALL the earths soil (the earth has a lot of soil) after removing the earths oceans and ice-caps to seriously impact the number of microbial species on earth. These surviving species would continue evolving and most likely give rise to multicellular, complex life once more."
StonerPhilosophy,3a9ccw,Jumbojanne,5,Fri Jun 19 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"Like Krabbamayne pointed out I think you have the wrong idea about evolution, it is not a directed process. It does not have goals or jobs. It's more like a principle or an emergent phenomenon, like whirlpools, fractals or complex weather patterns. One could also argue that any change we make in our own genomes (taking evolution into our own hands) is part of the course of natural evolution. Its just a matter of definitions.  Additionally, there is absolutely no possible way for humans to kill ALL life on earth. Microbial life is so widespread, diverse and tough that we can't get them all. They live and reproduce in the depths of glaciers, rocks and sediment. Deep down in the ocean depths. They would not be harmed no matter how many nukes we detonate.  Also there are theories that microbial life could be attached to rocks flung into space from asteroid impacts with the earth. These rocks would orbit the sun for a while and eventually collide with the earth again. Reintroducing those microbes that survived in the cores of the rocks. In this fashion earth would ""reseed"" itself with microorganisms capable of evolution."

I think the only thing I added was about the natural cycles of life on Earth, where genetic diversity expands, then contracts through mass extinctions, then expands through 'explosions' that fill the newly emptied niches and biomes, then contracts again.  I like your idea that human directed evolution may be considered natural as well, as we are just emergent phenomena of nature as well and therefore what we do is inherently natural.  In this same vein, our heralding of a mass extinction can be viewed as a natural disaster."
StonerPhilosophy,3a9ccw,philosophers-stoner,2,Thu Jun 18 09:55:40 2015 UTC,Thank you! I liked your response as well. The idea that there are natural and unnatural things are just an arbitrary definition we humans have made. Many people see humans as separate from nature which is somewhat strange to me. The distinction appears to be somewhat semantical. I like the idea of cyclical explosions and contractions of special diversity. It paints a nice image in my head :)

StonerPhilosophy,3a8xft,The_Spirit_Molecule,2,Thu Jun 18 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"Infinity, if it was a thing, is the most likely thing, of all things, to be possible. If you were to assume any one thing about things existing, the single thing which explains and repercusses the most is that infinity exists. Thus it seems to me to be the most logical thing to believe exists. And note that I say it is a single thing. Why? Because infinity is indivisible by any other thing except by itself. So from outside of infinity, everything within infinity appears to be the same thing. This is what it is to say ""we are all one"".   Notice that anything compared to nothing is infinite. Therefore if some thing with size that is greater in magnitude than nothing exists, then infinity exists. I'm not saying that ""square circles"" exist, just because infinite things exist does not mean every thing I can come up with exists, but it exists as an idea, even if it's not real.  Further notice that there are no knowable ""next numbers"" in the real number system the next number after 0 is not 0.1 or 0.01 etc. But there must be an order of them, so we've come up with a theory that there are next numbers, they are infinitesimally far apart. To get this size, take any ordinary number and cut it up infinite times, presto, in maths it's ""dx"".  This all means to me that any separation we perceive between to things is only a theoretical separation, a theory that we use because it works, because it makes sense to us and because we don't have any other option. But in truth there only exists one inseparable thing, which is why I think the words Religion and Yoga are made from the root word of union. 1/0 = One thing, that is no-where = Infinity = Unity = You. I also think that's why Descarte's ""I think therefore I am"" is so poignant, and why God in various forms said ""tell them I AM sent you"".  Also, if time were truly infinite (they mean the same thing to me) then each moment would be the beginning. It doesn't matter how far up the number line you go, compared to infinity, this is just the beginning. Which is why I think the first line of the Bible states, ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."" Heaven (all knowing utopia) doesn't seem to exist yet, so we must still be in the beginning. But I don't doubt that we'll make it to our utopic dream (I do, but you get what I'm saying).

There are always things I can not remember no matter how hard I try. I was in the Marines and have been out for several years. My first 2 years I was stationed in Okinawa, I lived and worked with the same group of people for 2 years and the other day a close friend brought up someone we knew pretty well for that 2 years. I remembered the name but could not for the life of me picture them or recall anything I ever did with that person. I could talk for days if I wanted to about the time in Okinawa. Some times it just seems like our minds pick and choose what to vividly remember and what to toss aside. Despite that I am sure of I heard that person past away I am sure I would feel much more than is expected for someone I barely remember.

I respect the way you think because it's the same way I think   I don't think an intelligent person assumes that all other intelligent people on the same ""level"" think the same way. I'd even wager that an intelligent person considers the possibility that experiences of thought differ or that their perception of how other people think is flawed.   I can't imagine thinking that way   I don't think this is absolute absolute/specific enough. I think somebody might have enough understanding of something to imagine getting more into it, but lack the dedication or resources to become as intelligent in that given area as the person being perceived as intelligent."
StonerPhilosophy,398csi,qzx,3,Wed Jun 10 06:29:29 2015 UTC,"Totally, but see, I'd argue they're not meant to be taken literally as conclusions to some scheme of elaborate reasoning, that is not to say there's any lack of thought behind the lines. I'd assume they were a verbalization of the process of comprehension that pushes into our conscious minds the view that another being is intelligent.   For if we can understand someone, that doesn't think the way we think, but thinks in a way our imagination is able to encompass/emulate or otherwise recognize as being less efficient than our chosen method of thought. One might think they were less intelligent.  Then secondly if we understand they way one thinks, and his system of thought is similar to the one we've chosen, from all systems within our realm of understanding; then the recognition of someone maximizing the potential of their mental capacity, as compared with ours (subconsciously, also probably erroneously), might give rise to thinking someone is intelligent, assuming one feels one self is intelligent. Thus the first case, a verbalization of comparison in abstract idea space about consciousness:    I respect the way you think because it's the same way I think    Then there's the case where someone thinks in a way that we don't understand, but manages to produce results that comparatively feel superior, yet we can't discern how exactly these results are derived at, there is no system of thought in our set of experiences that encompasses a model that can explain the performance, that is the second case:   I can't imagine thinking that way   Then there's creatures that we don't understand and don't compare results with, and for some reason, people tend to think other species on this planet aren't intelligent. But I think that might cover the situations of intelligence comparison that might arise as we strutt about in the tao and are suddenly visited by the thought ""This guy's pretty smart"". It's just the analysis of, well, where did that thought come from... where do thoughts like that, keep coming from?"

But shortly, I'll say I smoke in very much the same way you do and have a lot of the same fears. Honestly I'd be more concerned if you weren't worried about your school performance.

Weed is often an activity that arises out of a lack of things to do, or the lack of will to do those things.

StonerPhilosophy,38jv76,Impkid,22,Thu Jun 4 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Do you want me to say more?  All the time.  I get thought loops pretty frequently too, especially things regarding solipsism (the idea that we can't know anything except the our self is real, but I also think that even I may be illusory).  Here's how I handle it:  If none of this is real, so what?  What reason do I have to live as if it weren't real?  None, so I might as well continue existing within the confines of this universe as it presents itself to my senses.  Cool, no problems here.  What if there's some truth to these ideas?  Awesome, let's keep thinking about them.  They are interesting ideas and can provide new outlooks on existence.  But let's not get hung up on them, don't let them dominate your every waking hour.  Just as we can't be concerned with any topic all the time, allot time to this idea, give it it's time, then move on.  That isn't to say the things you think regarding this matter can't influence the way you live outside of thinking about them, it's just that you don't need to worry yourself over the particulars of things like 'it's possible that none of this really exists' or even that you yourself may not exist.  Now, this is easier said than done while high.  For me, if I'm looking for a head high, a thinking high, I resign myself to not being in control of the thoughts.  That's part of the ride.  If I don't want to think thoughts I may not like, I practice some measures that prevent me from getting into a thinking high, specifically I keep myself active prior to the onset of the high.  It doesn't have to be physically active, but that works for a lot of people.  Go for a walk, a hike, do a workout routine, whatever you like.  I find that playing board games or video games can occupy my mind and keep me from out of control thinking.  If I find myself looping when I don't want to (sometimes we're affected stronger than we anticipate) I practice repeating a sentence in my head until I've lost the train of thought (I've referred to this in the past my mantra method to staying in control).  Just latch on to any sentence, any phrase in your head, and repeat it until it doesn't mean anything, you don't remember how you got there, and you don't remember where you were going.  Hopefully this helps!"

Everything within my perception still exists within the meaning of the word existence. For example, last night I was looking at my lighter and went off on this train of thought and came to the conclusion that it exists dependently of my mind (breaching into idealism, I know), it exists on the same level as everything else outside of my mind but is still dependent on my mind perceiving it to exist, however; thats not to say that for the rest of my life I'm not gonna believe in the existence of anything but my mind, because the level of existence of all matter in the universe is never going to change in my perception, I'm never going to experience anything higher than my perceptual experience or drug induced experience in my lifetime, so I might as well carry on living this life while in the back of my head I know that my mind is on a higher level of existence than everything in my universe."
