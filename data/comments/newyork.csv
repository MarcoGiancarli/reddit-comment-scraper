newyork,3e78jk,winstonl,2,Wed Jul 22 14:22:51 2015 UTC,"While I wholeheartedly support raising the minimum wage and returning it to the concept of a living wage that it originally was intended to be, I find it odd to single out the fast-food industry. There are a ton of entry-level clerical workers, delivery people, warehouse employees, etc. etc. etc. who are not earning $15/hour and are equally deserving.  I also wonder if this applies across the board (corporations and small businesses), and why it isn't being phased in gradually. A family-owned Chinese food place or pizzeria may be significantly financially hurt by having to increase its payroll so dramatically."
newyork,3e78jk,TheCheshireCody,2,Wed Jul 22 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"Should be interesting to see how they define ""Fast Food"", because a search seems to show that rumors are that it goes to the number of operating locations that the parent company owns. If that's the case, Mom-and-Pop Chinese food place or pizzeria isn't necessarily going to be affected, other than that people will have more money to buy their food. That being said, I wonder where they will draw the line, and what places will count?   But I do agree that it's odd that the food industry in particular is being targeted, maybe they're hoping that the other industries will follow suit voluntarily to keep their workers from jumping ship? I mean, I clerk at a law firm, doing work that requires a college degree and an understanding of the law, and I'm not even getting paid that - it'd be a big jump for me. And I remember doing retail not that long ago, those people deserve a living wage, too. I do hope that this works out."

Many natives live their entire lives without ever owning a car. Its even easier if its a business trip. Just take cabs everyplace. Remember to get receipts and fill out your expense report properly.   Or if you feel like it , you can venture into the subway. Which very often can be faster than surface travel.   If you don't like going under ground , there is also a comprehensive buss system to use.   mta.info would be a good place to start."

There's a public transit option on googlemaps, but the subway routes often change late night and weekends because that's when construction is done (trains run 24hrs), and googlemaps often doesn't reflect the changes.   You can buy a MetroCard at any subway station--it's $1 for the card and $2.75 per ride, or there's a 7-day or month unlimited.   You can ask anyone for help and they will be very willing to give it---although 5 other people might chime in and give you different directions (which will all be correct). Just don't stand in the way of the subway doors or at the top or bottom of escalator or wherever you are in the way.  And the subreddit for questions is r/AskNYC but only use it for very specific questions......no one is going to answer if it's things like where should I go? What should I eat? What are some cool bars?"

newyork,3e3s4x,Usrname52,2,Tue Jul 21 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"Google Maps on your phone also gives transit directions so you shouldn't worry too much about getting lost on the subway. However I'd agree that if you can expense it, just stick to cabs. It might be a bit slower than subways at times but it's definitely easier. Also if you do wind up taking a cab at any point, it's always easier to give the driver the nearest intersection rather than a physical address."
newyork,3e3s4x,mistah_michael,3,Tue Jul 21 22:08:41 2015 UTC,"I think for business matters I won't be taking cabs, but I plan on experiencing the city on a personal level so I'll keep that in mind about cabs and intersections thanks!"
newyork,3e3s4x,dc567,3,Tue Jul 21 22:20:08 2015 UTC,Well I have one tip for the subways that a non native might not realize. Make sure that when you go into the station that you're going in the proper direction. Many subway stations are either downtown or uptown entrance only with the opposite direction across the street. Same goes for some east/west trains too. Mind you this isn't every station but you don't want to pay your fare and then wind up have to cross the street and pay again because you got on the wrong side.
newyork,3e3s4x,Drutigliano,2,Tue Jul 21 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"That's good advise, I'll keep it in mind thanks!"
newyork,3e3s4x,Drutigliano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Study the subway map. It looks intimidating but it really isn't that bad. North of Houston (not pronounced like the city in Texas), everything is a grid. Street numbers go up as you go north, and Avenue numbers go up as you go west. Many lines run along a specific avenue.   Also, if you see a really crowded train and one car is empty, DO NOT get on it. Trust me."

You start out driving around but then you realize that maybe if you take a subway once you won't have to worry about parking and traffic. So you decide to take the subway. Once. But that doesn't work out. Suddenly you realize that an unlimited metro card is way cheaper than paying for car payments, gas and insurance. You start saying to yourself ""maybe I'll just keep using the subway, but just a little bit and only in nyc"". But as we all know subways are the gateway to public transportation. Next thing you know you need to go to NJ and you're taking the Path or you need to go to Vermont and you take the MetroNorth trains. Shit, I got so into it that one time, I found myself in the M60 bus. A bus! And there I was. Sitting in a public New York bus, and all I ever wanted was to ""take the subway once"".

More importantly though, as the other posters have said, don't commute to Manhattan by car.

You'll do better to drive to the LIRR station nearest your town and take the train in."

newyork,3cbq4t,mistah_michael,5,Tue Jul 7 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"As a Long Islander, yes, that's true. I know very few people that have RWD as their only car. My coworker is one - he works from home in the snow. Even when it's just an inch or so.  If you're commuting to Manhattan from Suffolk or Nassau counties during normal driving hours, however, it's unlikely that you'll be driving - even on clear days. Most people take the train. Driving to Manhattan during rush hour is a special kind of torture.   So, given that, depending on how far you are from the train station, maybe you can just walk it on the snowy days or take a cab/hitch a ride.  Lower New York isn't the snowiest climate around, but I really wouldn't recommend a sports car as your daily driver. My wife drives a FWD car and does 'okay' in the snow. I drive a Jeep and wouldn't consider another non-AWD car - but you can do with less, especially if it's just a 'station car'."

newyork,3cbq4t,OutInTheBlack,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"Assuming your town in Long Island has plows (answer: yes), a RWD will be fine.

newyork,3cbq4t,gdelia928,2,Tue Jul 7 01:36:19 2015 UTC,Manhasset is a pretty easy commute on the lirr. Train plus transfers will make the commute just over an hour.    If you work normal hours between traffic and parking you will be way more frustrated driving in.   If you were on the oyster Bay line it's more of a toss up due to the frequency of late night trains but the Manhasset line is every 20 minutes or so before midnight on weekdays.
newyork,3cbq4t,NachoCanSandyRavaged,2,Tue Jul 7 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"With the train route you can at least read, sleep or simply decompress, driving in traffic on the other hand is just constant alertness and stress.

newyork,3cbq4t,fitnr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:40:42 2015 UTC,"The only way to find out is to actually do it. There are probably a dozen different ways to get from the LIRR to the Upper East Side. Experiment with getting off at Woodside, riding Citi Bike part of the way, taking a taxi part of the way, etc. When you drive, you're just stuck in the car, with transit you'll have other options for at least part of your ride. Plus, in a car you're stuck driving home, which will make running errands or getting dinner in Manhattan a pain.  Anyway, in 6* short years you'll be able to take the LIRR right to Grand Central!  * read as: ""at least 6"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Access"

I think you can manage traversing one of the most densely populated areas in the US without AWD in the winter.  Also, keep in mind that until the last decade or so, basically every cop car and taxi in NYC was a rear drive sedan, and they work year round."

If it isn't the potholes destroying your wheels, tires and suspension, it's the salt. Then there's the whole hassle of parking, arsehole self entitled drivers that don't drive for the conditions and having to sit in traffic for ages.   Don't make my mistake (I only commute very rarely all the way in my car), what's more necessary than AWD is a car that's reliable that you don't mind getting a bit beaten up.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

newyork,3a6hxe,CaptainPsyko,10,Wed Jun 17 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"City limits in New York State are restricted and cities cannot annex their neighboring municipalities easily like cities in other states can. The automobile and prefab housing made living in the suburbs cheap and easy. These cities were very polluted at the times, so that did not help things either. This is called suburbanization. Due to free trade agreements and automation, there was a sharp decline in the traditional industrial jobs found in these cities. These cities failed to invest in diversifying and expanding their economies until it was long too late. While there are a lot of great colleges to educate young people in upstate, finding jobs in the new technology, startup and creative service based economy most had to leave to find good jobs.   Note: NOBODY wanted to be in urban areas in the 70s and 80s. Even New York City saw population decrease as people moved to the suburbs.  There is Hope  This is from my perspective in Buffalo, but it seems to fit at least Albany and Rochester as well.   Upstate cities have finally start to invest in growing and diversifying their economies. This started with the Center for Excellence in Nanotech in Albany in the early 90s, and then replicated by a similar center for Biomed in Buffalo in the early 2000s. Now there are almost a dozen - mostly new - centers all across the state. Historic Tax Credits has been a HUGE factor in a lot of recent developments in these cities. It is now pretty lucrative to restore old abandoned buildings. Development of old building in and around downtown Buffalo has been so fervent that there wont be any abandoned buildings downtown within 5-10 years at this rate. Manufacturing is on the upswing - Rising wages in China, better automation techniques, lower wages because of the low cost of living and a large pool of skilled engineers means manufacturing is making a comeback. One of the largest solar panel manufacturing plants is being built right in Buffalo. Trends of Urbanization - Millenials want to live in walkable exciting neighborhoods close to a lot of amenities. This has cause an influx of young professionals to move back into city neighborhoods. In Buffalo the already stable neighborhoods are now getting very pricy and the once dicey neighborhoods on the Westside and near Eastside are now rapidly gentrifying. It is predicted that 2020 will be the first census where Buffalo posts a gain in population."

Here's a section from Buffalo's Wikipedia page that explains:   Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression brought about by suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, was significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population was equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change."

My rent that  keeps going up every year is a testimony of this. Of course this growth is not even. There are the trendy neighborhoods and the gentrifying ones, and then you have the stagnant ones and the ones still bleeding population.  Its a little bit more complex than that.  This isn't anything unique. Its a national trend towards urbanization again. Millennials are much more likely to hold off on marriage and having children, so the poor performing schools is not an issue for them. Instead they are attracted to the walkable communities and being close to nightlife and cultural amenities.  NYC is also at the bottom when it comes to school performance.

(I've lived in big cities before, even owned my first home in one, but I just find NYC to be filthy.)  That's my opinion, and just an opinion, but at least it's based upon something.    Aside from what /u/Eudaimonics has written, there are amazing opportunities for outdoor recreation upstate and in Western New York.  I can be at a ski resort in thirty minutes or less in the winter (many of those become mountain bike courses in the summer), and I can be sailing in ten minutes or less in the summer.  Not many places in the country boast that kind of geographic diversity.  And if I want to be in a huge city for a weekend or something, there's a much nicer one than New York City, and it's much closer, too.  Toronto.  Unfortunately, I think your observation that you're not unique is correct.  I think there are way too many NYCers who never get out and see the rest of the world, much less the rest of the state.

newyork,3a6hxe,ColonelFuckface,2,Thu Jun 18 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for Elmira, or Rochester or Syracuse.  I can say that Buffalo was hit, and hit hard, by a powerful one-two economic punch:  The loss of steel manufacturing in the 1970s and the collapse of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.  (Buffalo was home to Goldome, the largest savings and loan institution in the country.)  Twenty years of economic hardship followed.  That trend is now reversing, if it hasn't reversed already.  There are cranes in every direction (except west, because that's where the water is) from downtown.  While I expect population decline to continue, I do not expect it to continue at a rate that is quicker than that of the state as a whole.  Let's face it, plenty of people leave all parts of the state for warmer climes or better tax situations.  I think that's going to continue, but the ""brain drain"" that we saw the last twenty years, I think that's over."

If Elmira had more things going on other than their SUNY school, they would be in much better shape.

Add 1 to 1 and that is 100% increase.  1 + 80 is about 1.25%  One needs to apply some perspective with such comparisons.
newyork,3a6hxe,ProInvestCK,2,Sat Jun 20 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"Do you not know anyone who goes to one of the upstate SUNY Universities and Colleges?  There were a ton of people from downstate at UB when I went there.  Many actually stayed after graduation for the low cost of living and lack of the employment rat race you find in NYC.  Also, you never heard of Niagara Falls, Erie Canal, the Baseball Hall of Fame, or Corning Glass (which is in the smart phone you're using). Never heard of the Buffalo Bills or Sabres or the Bison's which used to be the NY Met's farm team?  Have you never heard of New Era Cap Company, Fischer Price or M&T Bank?  Sounds like you don't get out much."
newyork,3a6hxe,Eudaimonics,-3,Wed Jun 17 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"Look, I know people who went to a lot of those schools, and everyone knows Niagara falls. But there is a reason that for every kid who supposedly stays (according to you) several leave. Maybe I was overstating it, but even I (and many others), in this state, have never been made to feel particularly compelled to explore Syracuse or Buffalo or Rochester or Binghamton or whatever other 1 horse town in western NY because we know nothing about it. It's a complex issue I'm sure, but there is a reason the population center of NY state is in fucking Orange county, 60 miles from Manhattan. It's because wings and a glass factory aren't enough of a draw when you have one of the world's foremost metropolis on the other side of the state (might as well be the world). I guess what I'm saying is, its not 1910 anymore, and most people aren't interested in living in a place that's more like Ohio with strict gun laws and no jobs, and nobody dreams of vacationing in Rochester."
newyork,3a6hxe,ColonelFuckface,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"At the same time the Hudson Valley and Andirodacks are filled with downstaters on vacation dispute being in the middle of nowhere.  Sometimes, not having an overwhelming amount of things to do is a draw in itself.  14 million people visit the American side of Niagara Falls every year, just to see water flow over a cliff."

I hope you keep at it, and it works out. I would like to have real Buffalo wings sometime, and see whatever the fuck is in Syracuse. But fact is, most of upstate is depopulating for some reason. Taxes ain't it, or the NYC metro area would likely follow suit. Maybe it is something that will turn around, but for the foreseeable future, it looks like real estate north of the Catskills, by And large, isn't a sound investment."
newyork,3a6hxe,ColonelFuckface,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"My point was that other people from downstate seem to actually like traveling upstate and that you are just using your own personal opinion and presenting it as fact.  If you don't like quiet or outdoor activity you won't like upstate's nature. If you don't like museums or architecture or presidential history, you probably won't be visiting Buffalo anytime soon.   I'm not contesting that. But there are people with those interests, seemingly outside your limited circle of aquantences."

newyork,39wc5b,Eudaimonics,0,Mon Jun 15 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"There is no smoking at all in any establishment other than private residences.   If you need to smoke, you take it outside. If you are on a patio or other outdoor dining area, you cannot smoke there either if its covered (if its not covered then it depends on the facility).   There are a few member club type bars which are exempt from the indoor smoking ban, but those are pretty rare. Don't count on finding one just walking around.  Honestly, I don't understand how people stand being completely coated with tobacco inside restaurants and bars elsewhere in the country. Even my smoking friends agree that its better, even if they are inconvenienced.   If you have a vaporizer and are discrete about it - i.e. are not spewing out cherry cupcake scent - then you can usually get away with that in a dark bar environment. Though common courtesy dictates that you should go outside for that as well."

newyork,39cdna,ImSexyy,8,Wed Jun 10 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"First congratulations! Second absolutely come to the Finger Lakes we have a ton of great wineries. I would stick to wine tours on either Seneca Lake of Cayuga Lake, they are the two biggest lakes and they have the most wineries. If you want to hit up Seneca Lake I would look to stay in Geneva, NY, it's a nice little city right on the lake that is also in a pretty central location for visiting wineries or if you want to go check out Rochester or Syracuse. As far as hotels goes it really depends on your price range. The Belhurst Castle is super nice, but also expensive, but there are other more affordable options too. Geneva is nice because they have several different options.  As far as good wineries on Seneca Lake I really enjoy Wagners, Hazlitt, Three Brothers, Fox Run, Glenora, and Penguin Bay. The nice thing about these wineries is that you could drive the distance of Seneca Lake from Geneva to Watkins Glenn, while stopping at any one of the wineries on the lake. Watkins Glen has one of my favorite stake parks and also has a pretty cool race track.   For Cayuga Lake I would stay in Ithaca, which may be my favorite place on Earth. First of Ithaca is beautiful (or gorges) and has a ton of of great parks from Buttermilk, Treman state park, to Taughannock Falls. As far as wineries go there are a ton of options, and I've actually worked in several of the wineries. My favorite ones would be Hosmer, Americana, Knapp, Goose Watch, Swedish Hill, and Lucas. All of these have excellent wine and I think that Knapp and Americana have the best restaurants.   The nice thing about the Finger Lakes is that you could easily criss cross Seneca County between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake to go to any combination of wineries. Wine tours are great and really fun, and convenient because you both could drink, but I always enjoy hopping between the two lakes. Either way you really can't go wrong, it's a great place to visit."

Still, he has been out of office 8 years and reddit is a pretty young place. He really didn't do anything to help out upstate, so he's pretty forgettable for me. Then again, maybe being an obscure candidate will be a good thing for his campaign. He doesn't have nearly as much recent negative press compared to the other presidential hopefuls.

He wasn't a particularly impactful governor and the NYS legacy of political corruption in Albany means that the minute the media or a better funded candidate sets their sites on him, he'll get annihilated.

newyork,37pfi3,Funktapus,5,Fri May 29 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"The most practical route, if you want to explore some of NY and not go too far out of your way, would be to take 90 across MA to 87 South and make some stops along the Hudson Valley. A few recommendations are:    Catskill - a cute little town. Go through and down to Catskill Point, there's a little park there where the Catskill River meets the Hudson, very peaceful and a nice view.  Woodstock - total throwback hippy vibe, cute places to eat and shop. The Esopus River is around there too, and you can go tubing if it's still warm enough, which early Sept. usually is.  New Paltz - amazingly cute college town, plus there's a number of wineries around the area as part of the Shawangunk Wine Trail.  Poughkeepsie - Total foodie paradise with great restaurants plus a walking bridge over the Hudson with some breathtaking views.  Cold Spring - If you like antiquing, this is a good place for it. Another cute town with interesting local shops (tons of towns like this all over the Valley) and a nice river view park.  West Point - The Army Military Academy, lots of history, more excellent views of the Hudson, also Broadway touring shows play at Eisenhower Hall.  Beacon - if you like or would like to experience Baseball, see if you can get to a Hudson Valley Renegades minor league game. The season ends in early Sept. so that may or may not be an option.  Bear Mountain - hiking, picnicking or restaurant dining, and lodging with nice accommodations with beautiful views.  Peekskill - If you like craft beer, check out Peekskill Brewery.  Nyack - Another great river town. You can walk down to the water from the main town, lots of bars and restaurants, Elmwood Playhouse for excellent local theater, and you can walk along the Hudson at Nyack Beach State Park.    At this point you'd have a choice - you could head over the Tappan Zee Bridge and go through Westchester or stay on the Nyack side and go through Jersey via the Palisades or Garden State.  Weschester has a bunch more cute river towns, such as Tarrytown, Dobbs Ferry and Hastings On Hudson, but you'll have to get back west over the GW Bridge to hit 95 and continue through Jersey, which can be horrible for traffic at times.   The Jersey side is usually an easier drive, but with less interesting places to stop, but if you're done with exploring and want to get to DC fast, that's the way to go."

A representative originally attempted to contact me about 2 weekd after, however I was in the middle of a job interview and was unable to talk to her. She left a message on my voicemail stating I needed to contact her within 2 days or she would come to a decision regarding my claim. I called her nonstop but she never answered. I left TONS of voicemails for her but my calls were never returned. But somehow, by some miracle, I was able to get ahold of an operator who told me that the person handling my claim would definitely get back to me before making a decision. She assured this and told me not to worry. After days of not hearing anything, I received a letter in the mail saying my claim was denied. I was FURIOUS. I messaged the Dept of Labor on facebook (which by the way has way better customer service than their claims center), and they replied saying someone will be in touch with me to review my case. Surprisingly they kept their word and I was able to speak to someone about it several times. Now days later, I still haven't heard anything about my claim. I left a message to the new rep they assigned to me and he too has not returned my call. This video now shows what happens when I try to reach an operator to find out the status of my claim. It's complete BULLSHIT and I don't know how anyone puts up with it. After sitting through nearly 10 minutes of a boring old fart telling you what you should do instead of calling, he tells you to go fuck yourself and ends the call."

There are a few lines which serve the airport. $2.75, expect several hours and multiple transfers.   Cheapest realistic : Airtrain to subway lines A/E/J/Z,  depending where you're headed in NYC. Normally about an hour to midtown,  in the middle of the night,  I've spent three hours door to door.  $7.75.  Next: Airtrain to LIRR. Train to Penn Station,  then walk or subway to destination. Roughly 30 minutes to midtown. $13 during the week,  $9 on weekends when you buy a ""city ticket.""   Next: Shared private bus. 30-90 minutes, three different stops in midtown.  $15.  Car Service and/or Taxi: 30-90 minutes to midtown depending on traffic.  Taxi flat rate is around $47, but that's deceptive as tolls, luggage, and tip will push it well over $60"

You shouldn't hafta pay at metro, your bus fare should be transferable.  I used to catch it at terminal 4 but this site seems to be saying 5/6 now.

On the other side of the Buffalo River (on the Outer Harbor), the Coast Guard also maintains a few exhibits to look at.  Plenty of historic buildings too that local preservation groups do tours of."
newyork,33k1zr,Eudaimonics,2,Thu Apr 23 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"I back this too, are you a student? The Naval Yard in Buffalo is worth it and you'll have an excuse to see Niagara Falls. Contacting the Army Corps Engineers or the New York State Department of Transportation might help."

newyork,32ss0n,mat101010,2,Thu Apr 16 14:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yelp is past its prime or maybe it was too good for its own good. It is really hard to tell good from bad. Places that attract great reviews get flooded with people looking for the best. Inevitably, this attracts people outside of the intended demographic and they cannot appreciate why it initially got good reviews. This applies to high-end and low-end eateries. In the end, everything washes out to average unless there is a social media firm pumping in fake reviews.    Cafe Boulud   I stay at the The Surry Hotel witch is connected to Cafe Boulud. It's a five-stare restaurant to be sure but it also plays to the Upper East Side crowd and is a bit more stuffy and sterile than you'd expect from a place with ""cafe"" in its name. If you are looking for fine dining at 9am, this may be a good choice. However, the hotel above offers in-room dining from Cafe Boulud's menu. Great food, private atmosphere, one block from the park. The Surry goes for about $500 USD per night, not including breakfast.   One other idea to consider is just eating a pastry outside the window of the flagship store on Fifth Avenue à la the Breakfast at Tiffiny's movie. After your done with the light NY breakfast, just walk on in and surprise your SO with a real ring. I like the park idea better but I figured I'd point out the obvious.   One thing to note, you should let Tiffiny's know you are coming. They don't turn away tourist lookie loos so if you want the type of service you will be paying for, have your hotel concierge arrange an appointment (or I think you can do this online too). You can do without but there is a small risk of not getting helped right away."

My opinion is that there is little to suggest she will do anything more than simply use rhetoric and do next to nothing substantial with what sanders has proven he is committed to doing from the beginning. If you think there is a better candidate, and you consider yourself a den, go for broke and let's actually use Tue primary for its intended purpose. Chose the candidate who best reflects your ideas and make sure you get to the primary."
