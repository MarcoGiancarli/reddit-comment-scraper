CallOfDuty,3e2436,SmokeySaysWhoaThere,18,Tue Jul 21 10:57:07 2015 UTC,They are not gonna get banned. My suggestion is to switch to PC. There are on most servers active admins who ban cheaters.
CallOfDuty,3e2436,oliman22,4,Tue Jul 21 11:27:42 2015 UTC,Or servers that stream to GGC or something similiar.  Those are the only servers where I ever was able to play.
CallOfDuty,3e2436,Pronato,3,Tue Jul 21 13:27:57 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Am an active admin for =|FF|= fatal forces servers. Shameless namedrop
CallOfDuty,3e2436,ThePeskyWabbit,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"Really? I'd like to ask then because I pretty much stopped playing CoD4 after all of my favorite =[FF]= servers were apparently shut down. Last time I was on about a month or two ago, none of those servers existed anymore except for Killhouse 24/7. Are the others back up?"
CallOfDuty,3e2436,ss33094,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:07 2015 UTC,http://www.fatalforces.com/ we have the server status of all our live servers as well as IP addresses on the home page. See you there :)

CallOfDuty,3e2436,ThePeskyWabbit,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, without the =[FF]= servers, I basically have no reason to play CoD4. I don't play modded servers except for Combined Ops every now and then, but it's usually dead, and the only other regular servers are the AG ones, which are always packed with 40-50 people and are absolutely not fun, way too chaotic. I know -[FF]- supports up to 50 players, but I'm really glad they usually hover around 15-25 on average. If you're on the Broadcast 24/7 server, I'm AIDSlord6969 on there."

CallOfDuty,3e2436,ss33094,7,Wed Jul 22 00:56:26 2015 UTC,Get it on PC. Community run servers with active admins that ban cheaters. CoD4 is really fun on PC.
CallOfDuty,3e2436,Beowulf891,6,Tue Jul 21 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, what's the news here? The game is 8 years old, Activision don't care about it anymore."

CallOfDuty,3e3is1,whatuhdoc,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:40 2015 UTC,Cod4 is way more active than WaW. So get Cod4 if you want multiplayer (servers are usually moderated and hackers get banned pretty quickly) and WaW if you want custom zombies.
CallOfDuty,3e3is1,PotatoCorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:01 2015 UTC,I'd say you should get World at War for the sake of getting all the DLC for multiplayer and zombies in one transaction.

CallOfDuty,3e3is1,memoryresident,0,Wed Jul 22 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"No hackers, Cod 4 is the better game in terms of activity and server choice."
CallOfDuty,3e3is1,Nomnom_downvotes,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"Just an advice. Don't buy the games from Steam, the prices are ridiculous. Try g2a or Kinguin but make sure the seller is reliable or you might get scammed"
CallOfDuty,3e3is1,2dose,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"I have both, and I can tell you that unless you're buying WaW for the zombies, it's a bad choice. The multiplayer is boring and infested with hacker, but the Zombies community is buzzing. New custom zombie maps from tons of different map makers are put out regularly. CoD 4, on the other hand has a much more active multiplayer, especially with servers such as ProMod being mainstream. I personally enjoined CoD 4 better because its multiplayer felt really great and was much more active. All in all, I'd pick it over WaW (unless you're a zombies freak). Hope I helped :)"
CallOfDuty,3e4opr,ss33094,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:15 2015 UTC,"If it's not broke, don't fix it."
CallOfDuty,3e4opr,WickedColdfront,0,Wed Jul 22 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"But come on. That can apply to something like a core game function that is like a pillar holding up that game's experience. But these are animations, and this is just laziness, literally no other reason for these animations to still be there. Like I said, it won't impact the game, but it's still pretty pathetic that they aren't putting in new animations to keep things visually fresh. Makes it feel like you're just using reskinned weapons from past games rather than new ones."
CallOfDuty,3e4opr,WickedColdfront,3,Wed Jul 22 02:05:23 2015 UTC,There are only so many ways to reload a gun. I honestly don't understand why people get so worked up over this kind of stuff. I would much prefer that developers spend time on things that are going to add value to the game rather than something like a reload animation.   They're adding guns for free. If the reload animation isn't to your liking then don't use the gun.

That is a game that I want."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,thefacemanzero,-5,Mon Jul 20 23:47:49 2015 UTC,I dont think anyone thinks 1 cod game = 3 games. if anything im pretty sure people think that every cod game is a recycled version of the old so...
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,Zakattk1027,2,Tue Jul 21 00:26:33 2015 UTC,Pretty much every COD game equals 2 games for me. Multi and Zombies. I really dislike the campaign mode (personal taste related to game pace).

So sick of the boring ass ""follow the leader"", linear, scripted bullshit of the past games. I'll never understand these people who say ""CoD campaigns are always amazing"". These people see impressive set pieces and high production value and are brainwashed into thinking it's a good game, when in reality CoD campaigns are fucking terrible and boring."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,WarEagle33x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well, in your opinion they're boring. I think COD campaigns are great in the sense that they are easy and quick to beat while still keeping me interested in what's going to happen. Are they Red Dead Redemption good? No, but I still like playing the campaign every year."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,Gunpocket,2,Wed Jul 22 06:11:17 2015 UTC,"I think its a game with a few modes to play when I get bored with one, especially this one. Since it has coop campaign, re-playability might be more exciting, trying out new setups and such and coop is always fun."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,PancoBenJo,6,Tue Jul 21 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"Well, i dont think it would sell better. Maybe there would be some profit but it would not be more profit than on the normal cod games. I like Multiplayer a lot. I could not imagine a call of duty game without a normal multiplayer mode.   When i buy a cod the first thing i do is playing multiplayer   [hope you can understand what i wrote cuz my eng is not that good] ;)  Peace ✌"
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,JaySaladJay,4,Mon Jul 20 20:57:48 2015 UTC,There is an entire community of people who used to play call of duty who would buy a zombies game purely for nostalgia imo. (Yes I understood it your english is fine =) )
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,ThePrettyCareful,0,Mon Jul 20 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that after BO3 is done with they release a collection of all the zombies maps as a standalone game.  I don't ever play campaign or multiplayer, so buying an entire game is useless for me."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,RockinMouth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:12:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind a zombies standalone game. Price it at like $20 for only the zombies portion of the game while $60 gets you the full game (Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer).   Come DLC time they could charge like $5 for the new map. I think it would be pretty fair but I highly doubt Activision would ever do this."
CallOfDuty,3dzmnp,KindOfOk,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"It would likely be $60, but you're missing what the game would be.  An entire game dedicated to zombies would be campaign, (a real one, not a half-assed easter egg mission), multiplayer game modes, more time and resources into maps, weapons, characters, and more. You're thinking about just the zombies mode being ported to a standalone. Imagine an entire dev crew working on a zombies game. It would be glorious."

And no, this is not an ""easter egg"" because easter eggs are something you would hide in games for players to find.

CallOfDuty,3dvg18,rotatingmonster,3,Sun Jul 19 21:22:38 2015 UTC,just get the season pass. just 1 or 2 map packs will absolutely rape your matchmaking. or get none. they're basically forcing you to those two choices.
CallOfDuty,3dvg18,jewsandcazoos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"One of my friends on the Xbox One has only one map pack and has no issues with matchmaking whatsoever. That said, my personal favorite of the three that are currently released is easily the Supremacy pack"
CallOfDuty,3dvg18,UGxUnholySage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly get the season pass just you can have all the maps and not worry about not finding a game after a while. If you really don't want to get the season pass and just want 1 pack, get supremacy."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,imdirtysocks45,7,Sun Jul 19 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"How has nobody said mw2? I liked cod4 and it is a great game but mw2 added so much, the action was fast paced and awesome, guns were each different. TONS of replay value. Maps were superb, and to top it all off it was the last good game Infinity Ward made."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,evengraves,3,Mon Jul 20 01:23:12 2015 UTC,Mw2 gets my vote
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,spinkers,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:49 2015 UTC,"It really was great. It was a great sequel to a great game. You can use gun and do good with it, unlike some of the other CoDs. It also had my favorite gun in all CoDs, the ACR. The gun that beat people up close and at a range. Also the maps and killstreaks were great. The maps varied and provided intense battles. Maps like Terminal that have everything, great setting, nice and colorful, flows great for deathmatches and objectives placed in great areas. The killstreaks were fun to get and fun to use. The MW2 Chopper gunner is my favorite helicopter killstreak in the series, and nothing can compare. VTOL gunships and warbirds are cool, but aint shit next to the MW2 chopper. And the Harrier? Fuck dont even get me started. Proabably the best killstreak in terms of what it does for it's cost. For 7 kills it gives you an airstrike over an area, then the last harrier shows up with a machine gun to fuck up enemys in the open. The perks were great, but the system was a little basic. The perks itself were pretty good, and Im disappointed they didnt return to the new CoDs. Going back 2 the weapons, every category was usable. The ARs, LMGs, SMGs, Snipers, Pistols, shotguns, launchers, etc. None of them were outclassed to the point where you couldn't use them effectively (secondaries and shottys in new CoDs suck ass). I think part of what made these weapons great was great hit detection and the stopping power perk. Like every CoD, it did have it's flaws, however MW2 was the easiest to get around. The main issue is OMA noobtubes, and if you were a smart player, you could have easily fucked over the bitchass tubers. Honestly MW2 is the GOAT in my opinion, just because of it's playability and what not. If you still reading, sorry for any mistakes and if it sound weird I was texting my friend while writing this so apologies."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,FWcodFTW,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:38 2015 UTC,"Mw2 was fucking amazing, I was at my best at mw2 and knew all the tricks, if it's made backwards compatible I'll cry."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,MullerReus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"My view of MW2 is this: It added too much, especially for a sequel to CoD4.  Going from 3 set streaks to the option of having like 20 different ones to choose from, shotguns as secondary was a horrible idea, death streaks were ridiculous, pro perks seemed dumb while some of the perks were just straight up dumb: Commando  and One Man Army. The SMGs were at most on-par with the ARs which didn't make sense. Quickscoping was insanely annoying, and the level to prestige was a tad high."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly the reason most of that is still in the game was because of Activision being greedy bastards and firing Robert Bowling, and most of the remainder of Infinity Ward. Because of this, the game never got properly patched. But even with all of the bullshit included mw2 was the most fun. Every game has its bullshit, even cod4. At least mw2 was fast paced and way ahead of its time."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,evengraves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:08 2015 UTC,"Fun is subjective. I didn't think MW2 was fun (at least around the time of release). I've played it more recently and it's not too bad, excluding the OMA-Nubers."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well obviously. The question itself it subjective. Hell, it's all subjective because it's a fucking game. That doesn't mean a subjective opinion is bad. Out of all of my friends, most of then had the most fun times during mw2."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,evengraves,0,Mon Jul 20 12:51:31 2015 UTC,"MW2 is when it became very mainstream as well, and obviously it was for a reason. Not saying it was a bad game in any way, just didn't feel like a true successor/sequel to a game like CoD4."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"They're different games, but still very similar. Cod4 is more simplistic and old school, mw2 is more fast paced and arcadey. I still like both."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,evengraves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:27 2015 UTC,That's fine. I just prefer more simplicity with a face-paced tone.
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,12,Mon Jul 20 13:01:32 2015 UTC,CoD4.  A lot of people will say it's purely nostalgia but it isn't. I can go back and play it any time and have tons of fun. It was fair and balanced. Everyone had the same killstreaks. Every perk had downsides. There was barely ever any lag. It was and is just a great game.
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,3,Sun Jul 19 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"Call of Duty 4 showed the real CoD skilled players. Same gun variants, same perks, same killstreaks, it was entirely up to your CoD skill and ability to win gun battles."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,simplydunk,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's seriously not nostalgia at all. CoD4 is just the most ""right"" the series has ever been. I'm not sure how to explain it. All I know is, I still play it at least once a week to this day on PC. A game doesn't hold that kind of longevity on nostalgia alone. BO2 is tied though imo. BO2 was the closest one in the series to what adding onto the CoD4 formula should feel and be like."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,ss33094,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"I think CoD should try to go back to preset Killstreaks imo. A lot of people may hate this opinion and that's fine, but I think it'd be refreshing, especially with how fast pace the games have become."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,DeusEverto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:20 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with the 3-5-7 preset streaks again. You wouldn't hear me complaining if they announced that in a future game. As long as the game isn't made by IW or SHG of course.
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,ss33094,6,Mon Jul 20 03:32:45 2015 UTC,BO1 or WaW. I still play BO1 regularly on PC. Dedicated servers are nice and none of the guns are crazy over powered.

CallOfDuty,3dv24h,Bamboosha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:43 2015 UTC,Many may disagree. But in my opinion it's a tie between MW3 and BO1.
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,Beowulf891,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"When it comes to multiplayer, CoD4 is tops. It's balanced, engaging and nothing stands as really dumbly overpowered. I might be wrong on that but it's what I've experienced.  When it comes to singleplayer, it's World At War. Easily the best campaign in Call of Duty. Great missions, great characters, memorable ending sequences. The Red Army flag on the Reichstag... fucking amazing. Seriously."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,BrandonIPwN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"MW2 was full of bugs, but it was the only CoD other than Back Ops 1 that I actually had fun in. It was when the community peaked and all was well with the world."
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,Jackamalio626,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"Bo2 was the best IMO.  As for Bo3, I think it will be a good game as long as they focus on what makes Call of duty so fun, and not on silly gimmicks like squad points and exos (which I don't think are really that bad)"
CallOfDuty,3dv24h,camk1,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:53 2015 UTC,I'd say cod 4 honestly.

CallOfDuty,3duvz5,TheDiamondDog,6,Sun Jul 19 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Ghosts is hated on so unnecessarily. The campaign left something to be desired, but multiplayer was fun, and extinction was definitely cool. The perk system in Ghosts was a little odd, but the guns were well balanced (except for the honey badger. That gun made me mad) and the sidearms weren't useless like they are now in AW. Lethals and non lethals were useful if used right. Some killstreaks were a little useless though. The 14 killstreaks sucked really bad. Helo sniper was difficult to control, and it gave you a bad sniper imo. But other than those, the streaks seemed fine to me. Overall Ghosts was one of my personal favorites. Just cant see what the fuss over multiplayer was about :c"
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,LittleHomicide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:09 2015 UTC,Upvote for giving your opinion even though you know you may get downvoted :)
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,ExoEvolved,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:59 2015 UTC,Why thank you m8y c:
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,LittleHomicide,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:34 2015 UTC,"Really it came down to the fact that it brought back a TON of the randomness factor that had been almost entirely eliminated in BO2 thanks to shit like the dog, IEDs, Juggernaut maniac, and the huge maps with tons of dark corners and nooks and crannies. Ghosts was designed in such a way that, despite it's good netcode, way, WAY too many deaths were out of your control. The TTK was way too fucking fast, made gunfights nonexistent, whereas BO2 had actual FIGHTS because it took longer to kill. Maps were huge, it was a campfest. And to top it all off, Ghosts committed the worst sin of all. It was BORING. MW2 was a broken ass game, but it was a fun as hell broken ass game. Ghosts was just so god damn bland and an absolute snorefest, which just amplified the annoying factors. That pretty much sums up why no one likes Ghosts."
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,ss33094,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"Ghosts couldn't be played like BO2, or any other conventional CoD to date. You had to play smart. Campers were an issue, but a good suppressed smg/stealthy type class could wreck campers. IEDs were worthless if you jumped at the right time. AP rounds shredded maniacs. Imo, Ghosts was the most ingenuitive CoD to date. No guns were op, no guns were under powered. You died really fast, yes, but that is what made the game fun to me. You couldn't 1v6 and win just by dumb luck anymore. Ghosts required skills that most CoD players thought of as ""nooby"" or ""stupid"". I can see why you hated what you hated, but that doesn't mean it was a bad game. It just didn't appeal to you is all, right?"
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,LittleHomicide,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:44 2015 UTC,"Winning a 1v6 encounter is dumb luck in a game with a higher TTK? You can't seriously believe it takes more skill to win an encounter like that in a game where enemies take longer to kill than a game where you melt people the second you see them. There was no ""playing smart"" in Ghosts either. In BO2 you could play smart because maps were designed extremely deliberately and were super focused, with clear lines of sight, choke points, and lots of strategic positioning. Ghosts maps were random messes with zero flow whatsoever. In Ghosts you could get shot from any angle at any time if you did anything but sit in a corner all game. Ghosts is one of the least ""smart"" playing CoDs to date. It's a game that rewards camping and cheap tactics and nothing else. There is no such thing as gun skill in a game where you die the second someone appears on your screen and vice versa. It comes down to who sees who first. And with maps as huge and randomly designed as the ones in Ghosts, what little gun skill requirement was left is now completely gone. Ghosts didn't require skill, and it absolutely favored ""nooby"" and ""stupid"" tactics. Gun balance and netcode were all that game had, but everything else about it was absolutely terribly designed."
CallOfDuty,3duvz5,ss33094,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:17 2015 UTC,"I know you died pretty fast on Ghosts, but I never had a problem with that. I could get tagged, turn, and blast whoever was shooting at me. The only guns I'd seen kill you insanely fast were the r5, sa-805, ripper, and suppressed smg. The maps were poorly designed, i agree. Stonehaven was a nightmare, but that was about it in my eyes. The other maps allowed for ways to get around to the campers/cheap spots and kill whoever was there. My favorite example of doing that was on that snowy trainyard map. People camping on the third level of the brewery(was that the callout??) Could be killed from anywhere BUT the entrance to third floor. Just had to go around the campers line of sight. 1v6 in every other CoD to date was always dumb luck. In Ghosts, you had to be careful. In BO2, and every game before, you could run in guns blazing and get all 6. You just needed extended and good control of your aim. Im not here to cause fights or anything. Im just pointing out what I feel are reasons why Ghosts doesn't deserve so much hate. Other CoDs have rewarded campers before. This game just got more hate because you died faster, I guess. You make some valid points though. Glad to see that not all CoD players are 15 year olds who banged my mom or deep voiced black guys who call me names when I kill them lol."

Why any of these people still want to do it in pubs is beyond me. I started playing competitive, like MLG and GB variant, not eSniping, because I hated the things that go down in pubs. If you're a sniper and you hate getting rekt by subs and ARs, why not go play matches with other snipers? It doesn't make any sense to me that these guys are so stuck doing the same thing and getting pissed off about it."

CallOfDuty,3dlmzv,indifferential,0,Fri Jul 17 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it is probably the most balanced game in the series, with some of the best maps they have ever made."

Pretty balanced though. The fact that I can use any gun and get first place, and use any gun and get last place, says something. These days if you don't have an asm1 you're sitting in last place.

CallOfDuty,3dlyku,ss33094,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:37 2015 UTC,I think its only just barely justifiable to youtubers and pros. YouTubers base their whole lively hood off of rapidly putting up videos of content before anyone else. Their life is gaming so they probably already have a ps4 anyway.   Pros need to get practice in and are sometimes also youtubers. So not only are they trying to put out content they need to get as much practice and scrims in as possible on all the MLG playable maps.
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,pretendingtolisten,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:08 2015 UTC,I heard that there is never DLC maps played in MLG tournaments.
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,SusanKriegsworth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"I never knew that, so that means pros dont even have to switch, but probably will cus of the sponsorships and shit. If Microsoft and MLG dont have a contract"
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,pretendingtolisten,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:55 2015 UTC,If you're trying to decide who to join when you want to upgrade then it's justifiable to spend at least $400 on a new console. If you already own a PS4 or Xbox One then there is no reason to spend another $400 just to get DLC early unless you manage to sell the console that you are replacing for at least $300.
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,SusanKriegsworth,5,Fri Jul 17 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"There are rumblings of the Championships going PS4 this time around, but honestly-- I'd play with the people you like to play with most. If you have no real-world ties either way, then I'd say the PS4 has the edge in performance (remember, AW isn't true 1080p in multiplayer on X1)  I've also noticed the PS4 community tends to be a hell of a lot more mellow, but that may be a positive or negative to you. That community may shift, especially if Competitive does move to Sony.  I've also noticed a hell of a lot of the more popular SCUF designs are sold out for PS4, and that they've been sold out pretty much since the exclusivity news hit. Seems to signify a lot of the more competitive community straight up bailed.  As for the month-long wait itself for DLC? It's a pain in the ass, but at least you can take comfort in knowing the maps are tested before they hit your console. I won't lie, though, it's painful to wait for that first DLC if you've been playing the game nonstop since launch and have to wait longer for anything new. And I mean anything: it's not just limited to maps, but it also includes character customization packs (huge for me, but I'm shallow) or DLC in general. Updates also tend to show up later.  There's a special circle of Hell reserved for watching youtubers try the ins and outs of a new map pack while you're playing Uplink for the six hundredth time. HEY GUYS WHAT'S GOIN ON  I will say this as a PS4 player, though: the Xbox Elite Fancy Controller has me jealous. Take heart, though: BOTH communities have players that will wipe the floor with you. You'll get your challenge either way."
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,GratefulUser,2,Fri Jul 17 11:15:31 2015 UTC,"I hope it is true that both communities give a good challenge. My first console COD experience was with MW2 on PS3. I remember thinking i was really good. But moving to Xbox 360 i realised that they were just bad players.  Also even if MLG goes with PS4, pros could still play on xbox in their free time. I mean for them it doesn't make a difference while most of them have both consoles. I am more interested in the community that is between casual and pro, those who i meet in game. What will they do?"
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,GratefulUser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:49:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly? There's no telling what will happen. I'd suggest picking up a bundle (with packin game) that interests you from a retailer that doesn't do restocking fees. Hold off on buying games (hard to return) until you've had enough experience with the controller and system software to form a strong,  personal opinion.  If it doesn't click,  then try the other."
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,ss33094,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where people get this idea that Xbox players are better than PS players. In my experience I didn't notice a difference at all. On PC, however, that's a different story. If you want to see a noticeably higher skill gap and some inhumanly good players, try playing any of these games on PC."
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,simplydunk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"But tell me this, although some people might be thinking “all PS4 players get is 30 days access to downloadable content before Xbox” That said change would mean that if players (i'm talking about professional players now) want to remain at the top, they have to have access to the latest maps and guns to stay ahead of the curve. I can see the community shifting. I have a feeling everyone will switch over to PS4 as soon as possible."
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,mifflinity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:11:09 2015 UTC,They have never used dlc maps or even allowed dlc guns in competitive. AW was the first to allow dlc maps. The competitive guys didn't like it because they didn't expect it at all. So your point is kind of silly. Youtubers will benefit most from owning a ps4 not necessarily competitive.
CallOfDuty,3dlyku,KindOfOk,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"Unless you are going to play in MLG tournaments, or are a YTer who needs access to content on Day 1, don't buy another console.

CallOfDuty,3dkgn0,ss33094,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"Wrong. In a competitive environment, that would be true to an extent. But when playing the game casually it's nowhere near as big of a deal. You act like the Treyarch games have completely unplayable netcode. It's not great, but it's not gamebreaking at all. If the netcode mattered that much, BO2 wouldn't be the most played CoD three years after release and the Treyarch games in general wouldn't be considered the cream of the crop out of the three studios. If you honestly prioritize amazing netcode with an absolute shit game over an excellent game with average netcode, then I really don't know what to tell you."
CallOfDuty,3dkgn0,prokreat,0,Sat Jul 18 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"You obviously have your head up your own ass and never played CoD in its prime. BO2 was the major failure in sales and playerbase. Both significantly declined. MW3 didn't help things along but sold more than any COD. it's been many years since the half million to million player base online at any given time. THAT was when it was casually awesome. Now it's just a piece of shit kiddie game that 3arc caters to with horrid coloring and their stupid weed camos for microsales. Ghosts plays great and balanced with two major annoyances, IED and dog. The movement in that game is spectacular and makes BO2 seem a slushy mess."
CallOfDuty,3dkgn0,ss33094,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"Never played CoD in it's prime? Lmao dude, I've been playing since the original came out in 2003 on the PC, I know my shit. I've been through all of the ups and downs of this series. BO2 may have been the point where the series declined, but that wasn't the fault of that game, that was the fault of fatigue setting in for the series in general by that point as well as the previous game being complete trash. I've played this series since it first started and I stand by my word when I say that BO2 is the best game in this series, only tied with CoD4."

Not only that, but the Treyarch games are designed around competitive play, so out of all of the developers, Treyarch is the one that would least appeal to the kids. And I'm not sure what you mean by ""horrid coloring"" unless you simply prefer drab, multiple shades of brown rather than vibrant, beautiful colors."
CallOfDuty,3dkgn0,ss33094,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but it's been proven that the netcode itself isn't even the cause for most of the frustration in the Treyarch games. It's the camera being placed ahead of the character model, which exists in the actual game code, not the netcode, meaning that this issue comes up no matter what, even in split screen, leading to quick deaths when people suddenly pop up around corners."

Pre-order from Amazon or a lot of other online retailers and you pay nothing until the day it ships, meaning you can cancel post-beta if you want.  It would only be a demo under a different name if it came out like two weeks before release like the BF3 beta, but this one comes out almost 3 months before hand, meaning treyarch can use the extra time to find and squash bugs, change broken gameplay features, etc..."

MW2 and MW3 have small populations but TDM, Dom and S&D usually work okay. On MW3, KC and Demo usually have a few games up during peak hours. BO2 is usually always good to go. I basically never have issues finding matches. Ghosts is a crapshoot. During peak, you might get 700 people, but you can get TDM going at the very least. AW isn't worth it now. Used to be okay but then DLC hit and SHG never fixed matchmaking so PC got fucked.  Anyhow, the reason that PC CoD is so fucked is the lack of support. Nobody gives two fucks about us except Treyarch. IW hasn't since CoD4 and SHG tried but they ruined it with their awful MM system. Such a shame since Call of Duty is actually really fun..."

CallOfDuty,3dku0f,Beowulf891,2,Fri Jul 17 03:58:21 2015 UTC,AW usually runs okay but the matchmaking is terrible so you never find games. That's what killed AW on PC the most.

CallOfDuty,3dg1u3,jacob2815,0,Thu Jul 16 13:20:16 2015 UTC,"Um yeah I understand. I've read all the Easter eggs on the cod wiki. And from what I can tell, I'm left scratching my head because although the Easter eggs reference past events, ultimately the map only ends when you're downed without being able to be revived. The only two maps to break this continuity is Mob of the Dead and Origins which feature end cutscenes. Even the first Exo zombie map on advanced warfare end with the rescue helicopter being shot down and you just roam around till you're killed."
CallOfDuty,3dg1u3,jacob2815,3,Thu Jul 16 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't say you don't understand the storyline. I said that you don't understand the premise of zombies.   The point of the storyline (Easter eggs) is that you don't just endlessly survive on the maps. There's a story that involves the characters leaving the map to go to the next one.  The point of zombies is to endlessly survive on the maps until you die. You can't leave the map as part of the story because that would defeat the whole purpose of zombies.   You just have to go with it and understand that when you die in zombies, your death isn't canon. The Easter eggs are, and that's what carries over to the subsequent maps. Don't take what you do on the zombies map so literally."

CallOfDuty,3dg1u3,Freelieseven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:40 2015 UTC,Actually the outcome of each map you usually don't die. The Easter eggs are what the story us based off of and the characters don't die in the Easter egg endings

CallOfDuty,3dg1u3,Freelieseven,2,Thu Jul 16 04:18:11 2015 UTC,End game on five is that everyone dies to the zombie horde.
CallOfDuty,3dg1u3,FiveFinger_Discount,0,Thu Jul 16 07:12:40 2015 UTC,"This is what makes Zombies a non enjoyable game mode for me. I can't take the stories to be canonical as it's to be assumed you eventually die. So like in Black Ops 2, in tranzit you eventually die and then are transported to Die Rise. Then after you die there, you're sent to Buried? So I don't get that."

The netcode is just fantastic. Yeah there's that little bit of host advantage, but at the same time everyone doesn't have that built in 180ms of pure ass that gets added in on top of the actual lag. This means that when I see someone and I decide to shoot them, weird funny shit doesn't occur where I shoot 5 bullets, maybe get 2 hitmarkers and then die instantly while showing the guy shot me 7 times. If I shoot, they die and that's that. You can't overstate how solid functional netcode makes the game incredible."

CallOfDuty,3defy2,EasyGh0st,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:11:28 2015 UTC,They weren't all that common until Black Ops 1 as a result of MW2. I remain convinced that major rebalancing patches from Treyarch only came out because of the heated backlash against MW2 at the time.
CallOfDuty,3defy2,pretendingtolisten,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:23 2015 UTC,there was a short time after release where this game was toooooo fun. it just felt like cod was at its peak then the countless exploits appeared in EVERY lobby and IW failed to fix most of the issues
CallOfDuty,3defy2,aflyingpope,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:05:19 2015 UTC,Everything in MW2 was OP as fuck and everything was FUN that's why people love it so much. It doesn't take its self seriously it's just fun.
CallOfDuty,3defy2,pretendingtolisten,0,Sun Jul 19 09:17:14 2015 UTC,"MW2 was never patched because of issues between IW and Activision, IW eanted creative freedom and had a contract with Activision to take up to 3 years to make a new cod game(funny cus thats the current policy, just with 3 developers now so they can milk oit money each year still) but Activision went back on it and they had a huge falling out.IW was sued Activision and mw2 was pretty much left in its state. Thats was probably a bit before OMA+Noobtubes was found out and when the community started exploiting EVERYTHING in the game there was no one left to fix it. Most of the IW left team and later formed Respawn, and just left a hollow shell of IW behind. MW2 was probably untouchable because of some sort of legal action, or Activision just didnt care, they had already gotten the money out of it.  Secondly the game was pure fun, maybe its nostalgia clouding my memory but i spent hours a day on that game. I had over 28 days played on MW2 and no other cod has come close since.   MW2 is still the best to me, even if BO2 comes 2nd its not close and not in the term of pure unadulterated fun. It was more balanced, kept a good pace, and had some good map design, but it wasnt MW2.  TL/DR MW2 is the best, everything else is still 2nd"

CallOfDuty,3d9epq,BrassVerdict,17,Tue Jul 14 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"Siege (Ghosts)  Stonehaven was too large but had open lines of sight and essentially became a thermal sniper/marksman map. It functioned despite its many problems. Stormfront was very similar, except with shorter lines of sight. A standoff until the game time expired.   Freefall was a cluster of short paths, shaky screen and falling rubble. Utter chaos but playable. Just turn your brain off and muscle memory your way around with an SMG/shotgun and it'll be over soon.  Siege. Domination didn't have a score limit, but it should have on Siege. Multi-levelled, huge and messy. There really isn't much to say about Siege other than it is a landscape. It's a somewhat functional environment that feels real, but real doesn't really make for good gameplay. It just didn't function as a multiplayer map. At all.   edit :To follow up, a lot of Infinity Ward base game maps feel like landscapes rather than game maps. Another example, in Whiteout (Ghosts) there is a house. It's a pretty house but it serves little purpose. There's an upstairs which is nicely modelled and textured, as far as Ghosts goes, but does nothing to enhance gameplay.   Another example? Downturn. Good lord Downturn."

On the other hand, in the DLC zombies, Treyarch have made it pretty fun to gather around all the items beause it involves stuff like going in to the ""Afterlife"" and turning on the power, and getting the warden's key ETC."

You get Mob Of The Dead (for zombies),Studio (a remake of BO1 Firing Range) Vertigo and Encore. This is probably the best because Studio is one of my favourite MP maps and so is MOTD. For BO1 get the dlc with moon because you gt all of the WAW dlc aswell which can be played through BO1."

CallOfDuty,3d5g68,Freelieseven,3,Mon Jul 13 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Ghosts (at least on PS4) is flooded with players who don't have the DLC, so you end up rarely finding yourself in a DLC map.  Only in TDM do you have a good chance of landing in a DLC map, and even there, once your lobby picks a base-game map, you're pretty unlikely to find any more DLC maps on the playlist.  That's my experience anyway. I'd disagree that the base maps all suck though. I like about half of them, and those seem to be the ones that most people like, so you end up playing the better ones like Strike Zone, Warhawk and Freight a lot more frequently than the bad ones like (imo) Siege and Whiteout."

CoD games sell low on steam since other sites like Amazon and G2A have better deals than steam.    Given that Black Ops 2 has more of an active following than most other recent CoD games on PC, I think that the PC community will be more likely to embrace it, especially if the PC version is of high quality."

CallOfDuty,3d1n9r,Momskirbyok,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"That's a real shame. I always find it ironic how the CoD series has generally not been great on PC due to it's console focus considering it started as a PC exclusive and the first few games were developed for it as the lead platform. It's like the devs don't realize that CoD could be fucking legendary on PC with mod support, server browsers and all that. it seriously has the potential to sell ridiculous amounts if they just put in the work.

CallOfDuty,3d0a2t,ostinnelson,3,Sun Jul 12 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting, might want to see this as it could help you understand the context of what is going on. You never mentioned how the cycle is a loop in that origins being successful causes the cycle to repeat itself again. In theory this Richtofen will be breaking the cycle which is exactly what I believe is going on so yea you got it right, just a small concept in the storyline you may not know of. Which I called myself 2 months after Origins came out as a possible outcome of zombies but didn't expect Treyarch to do as I believed Origins was supposed to end it all. Apparently Treyarch wants to continue the story line and these characters are the right way to go I'd say for continuing the story."
CallOfDuty,3d0a2t,trevormine,3,Sun Jul 12 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the link and never really did the Origins easter egg, so i had no idea it was a massive loop, so i appreciate the link a ton :P"

CallOfDuty,3d01mf,nyanfish,9,Sun Jul 12 09:46:53 2015 UTC,I'd say none to be honest.  If it were me I would just use that money on the BO3 season pass or something like that.
CallOfDuty,3d01mf,rhcp88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:37:44 2015 UTC,No one really plays the DLC on PC but it depends what you're playing on. I agree none the less though with you that the dlc isn't really worth it compared to what Treyarch are probably going to be pulling out. That and as people have seen Sledgehammer are just cloning sets and changing rarity to rip players off and that shouldn't be rewarded (as someone myself that bought AW with DLC being hopeful it would end up successful).
CallOfDuty,3d01mf,trevormine,3,Sun Jul 12 15:48:30 2015 UTC,I think the third DLC is much better than a lot of previous ones. The multiplayer maps are good for several play styles and the zombies map got me to like zombies more.  You should get opinions from people in-game too.

CallOfDuty,3cu6am,XSoldat13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, aside from AW's terrible map design that causes it to be absolutely frustrating and chaotic with zero possibility of map control, I found the game to just be boring. Which is so weird because when the game's trailers were coming out, it looked like the most fun CoD to date. For some reason though, the fun factor just isn't there in AW.  And yeah, Ghosts was abysmal. Like I told someone else in a thread a few days ago, Ghosts is the one and only game in the series that I will flat out tell someone they're wrong for liking. If you like Ghosts, you like badly designed games, simple as that. Opinions be damned."
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,Seekistguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it'd be cool to see what they could do. On the other, they wouldn't have the financial support of Activision. There is kickstarter, but with their reputation, I can see the platform publishers (Sony and Microsoft) jumping on the opportunity. Mainly to buy the exclusivity of the game. The extent of the exclusivity can't be known for sure. Re we looking at Destiny level or Street Fighter V level?"
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,ss33094,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:41:06 2015 UTC,Yeah their ideas could really be enough to make a different game. I mean even just a zombies game would be awesome! Treyarch just masters zombies.

CallOfDuty,3cu6am,JesusSwallowsDaily,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"I dont play COD that much. I was just curios if the was a subreddit for cod, and this is the first post i saw. Anyway, in my opinion its like this: They are already part of the biggest FPS franchise in the world ( i believe ) if they split now they have to start a new game, which then has to create a new reputation and earn a fan base. Imagine the fan base that COD has now to the one Treyarch aims towards. So many people buy cod its insane, but for the creators its a blessing. But to answer your question, IMO the last good cod made from Actovision was mw2, after that the only cod games that impressed me where bo 1, bo 2. So yeah maybe they should split and start their own games"
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,disclaimer065,2,Fri Jul 10 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"Modern Warfare 2 is where CODs simultaneously good and bad reputation came from. It introduced the general unbalanced feel in most cod multiplayer titles. Including Spawn Camping, Quickscoping, Trick shots, unbalanced killstreaks, noob tubing, a heavy emphasis on camping, and guns with unbalanced accuracy and damage stats.   IMO the best cods have been made by Treyarch, and the best feature of these games has been the zombies for quite a while. Since WaW multiplayer.  Anyway, there is no real reason for them to split off of Activision, as it is they make plenty of money, but their quality of living would go down drastically if they split off."
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,prokreat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:53:58 2015 UTC,"Sure Mw2 hat its down sides. Maybe it was my favourite too because i met so many people there and it was the first cod that i played multiplayer on. But mw2 to this day, i believe still has the best Map design of any call of duty, the best perk system of any call of duty and the 25 kill for a nuke and then ending the game with a Nuke feels much better than the word "" Nuclear "" appearing on screen. For me it was right on the edge of simple, yet complex. You could have fun as a casual ganer who plays it twice a week and you could have fun playing 5 hours a day."
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,WarEagle33x,-1,Sat Jul 11 09:38:41 2015 UTC,Personally I thought pro perks were one of the worst things to happen in CoD. I'm so glad they only lasted three games
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,prokreat,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"3arc puts out worst CoDs to me, except SHG now is as bad. IW has best MP engines and netcode so I wouldn't care if they left the development of it. Then again, this Reddit is full of 3arc fanboys so I can't expect many here to agree."
CallOfDuty,3cu6am,EBOLANIPPLES,0,Sat Jul 11 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"IW made good games up until MW2. Mw3 wasn't bad, just not the game for me.  Cod Ghosts was utter shit. SHG made the series worse. It's down to treyarch!"

CallOfDuty,3cv5s5,9000cody,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:23:49 2015 UTC,"So basically what had happened was, the crusty crab was a front for a drug operation. Mr. Crabs is the king Pin and Squid is the dealer. Sponge B whips up the drugs. He puts a bit of Crusty(the name of the drug) in every burger. The problem is he got addicted to the shit and is always high now. MC( Mr crabs) can't fire him though because SB knows the recipe and could sell it to plankton who's trying to synthesize his own shit. So MC just keeps SB high so he'll work. That's why sponge bob is always so dumb. Mofo is high as a kite.   Please send me the key. If I don't play the beta I probably won't get the game."

Spongebob quickly grabs gary he squeezes him dropping all of his slim in him patrick pulled out spongebob said its ok ""im ready"". Patrick proceeds. After that long and hard morning spongebob runs to the crusty nip where he frys up the best and crustest nip in the bikini bottom. Spongeboob gets there where he is greeted by mr crabs in a slutty cop lingerie with a whip and says you are late big sponge. Crabs says ""you know the wetter you get spongbob(he leans close to is ear) the bigger you get. Spongebobs says you know it as he reaches for his ass then he starts pastionatly kissing as they start to take off there clothes squidward tenaballs get to the crusty krab after putting alll of his tenticles in him all morning. He goes to the kitchen and starts preparing the meat by beating it and making it tender. He doesn't wash his hands cause he knows people like the special ingredient. Since his eyes are still crossed by cumming all morning he didnt notice the sponge and crab. As the sponge and crab are still making out they walk slowly to the kitchen opean the swivel door thing and then... to be continued tomorrow because it is late af and i have to sleep we will reach the climax of spongebob and the  bikini bottom bitches.

They say that it's because they're waiting for publishers permission but c'mon guys that's a yes or no answer, why has it taken so long?

CallOfDuty,3cpzez,BigMoney_D,5,Thu Jul 9 22:23:32 2015 UTC,And even with that we have no clue the context we'll encounter the boss. I mean it could be a completely different game mode like they had in BO2. I would assume they'll follow along like in BO2 where they had two or three game modes for each map.
CallOfDuty,3cpzez,thebigthunk,2,Fri Jul 10 02:31:30 2015 UTC,I think that could totally work. Would be kinda neat if it was it's own game mode. Maybe that's not even a regular thing? It could be a step in some big easter egg...
CallOfDuty,3cpzez,Ga1axy_Wo1f,2,Fri Jul 10 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"The alien seemed to work. It could just be a boss for a random. And interesting thing they could do with it is not give it a set round, but make it spawn for a random one."

CallOfDuty,3cpzez,nthitz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:30:27 2015 UTC,The tentacle boss just seems a bit out of place. Atleast Georgey somewhat made sense. Its a big zombie director. Ghost witches? Okay. Giant Robots. Understandable. ALIENS??? Woah.
CallOfDuty,3cpzez,ArcherInPosition,2,Fri Jul 10 07:56:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't quite say George made sense. They never showed him turn into a zombie. And then there's so many questions. Why is he bigger? Why can't he die?

CallOfDuty,3cpzez,MiniiNinja,5,Thu Jul 9 21:31:08 2015 UTC,I wonder if they will attempt to tie this into the existing zombie storyline at all.

CallOfDuty,3cpzez,gaute97,0,Thu Jul 9 22:10:19 2015 UTC,IIRC they have to be careful of mentioning nazis as any mention of it is not allowed in Germany.

In all my years of gaming the most I've spent on a collectors edition was $160 for MXK. Heck the ESO online was $100 and probably the best collectors edition I've ever had.  I REALLY hope there's other-cheaper collectors editions available for purchase of BO3.

DLC, huge 240 page book with art and lore and a awesome 12"" statue all for $100.  wtf COD. get it together"
CallOfDuty,3cpuao,T_Snake451,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:45 2015 UTC,BO2 didn't have a season pass and I think most people bought it for Nuketown Zombies which ended up being available when you bought the season pass anyways. I expect the same thing to happen with The Giant. Greedy people.
CallOfDuty,3crbyu,wisconsinrules8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:44:29 2015 UTC,I'm assuming the jugg edition is the machine+hardened edition like in bo2. Sell the hardened edition for the digital.

CallOfDuty,3cllfk,Beowulf891,8,Thu Jul 9 01:24:24 2015 UTC,My problem with that is weapons. Almost all muskets and lever action rifles that are very similar.
CallOfDuty,3cllfk,HappyGangsta,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"If they went with the Philippine Insurrection era, it's pretty much lever action and trapdoor rifles, revolvers and shotguns with some gatling guns and cannons for good measure. It may not be the most diverse, but it would probably work pretty well. I don't see it happening but there are plenty of options to use."
CallOfDuty,3cllfk,Beowulf891,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:05 2015 UTC,Ok so what if we have a new WWII or WWI but with some flash backs to the Revolution or one of those wars.
CallOfDuty,3cllfk,HappyGangsta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it's hard to see how someone could remember the revolutionary war if they were alive in the WW1 era. Personally, I think a alternate universe WW2 Futuristic game would be cool. Kind of like Wolfenstein. This could satisfy the WW2 and future aspects, while also having a twist, and a non predictable campaign (because we all know who won WW2)."
CallOfDuty,3cllfk,ZeNorseHorseSleipnir,5,Wed Jul 15 02:32:51 2015 UTC,WWI is really the furthest back you could go...

(Source: http://www.codonlineblog.com/2015/06/23/activision-says-world-war-2-era-call-of-duty-comeback-certainly-possible/)  Think about it this way, Treyarch had to do Black Ops 3 this year because they had to finish the trilogy. Sledgehammer Games is likely going to continue with Advanced Warfare since its a new series. Infinity Ward will probably continue with Ghosts as the story was left on a cliffhanger. Although Treyarchs next game could be set in the past as they can start fresh."

CallOfDuty,3clrq5,Grady39673,3,Wed Jul 8 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's situational.  I like frags for hardpoint matches, because I can bounce them off of a wall and hit somebody in the corner of a building that a semtex would not reach without putting myself in danger.  I like Semtex for domination/momentum matches, because it's easier to aim the semtex at a flag on the ground.  Frags will roll and can be thrown back, while semtex will explode on whatever surface it hits."
CallOfDuty,3clrq5,tyzenberg,3,Thu Jul 9 00:08:53 2015 UTC,Depends on the game. In certain cods the one does more damage than the other. I seem to have more success with frags than semtex on bops II.

CallOfDuty,3ckcyh,SillyBronson,6,Wed Jul 8 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"Try to adjust your controller sensitivity to the most comfortable for you, while still being quick enough to snap around the screen and lock on a target. UPPER-CHEST AND CENTER MASS  Aiming down sights around corners is a good one, people often have no idea how you could kill them so fast if you just aim around corners. Of course, check your six every now and then :)  Another thing to note is that your class setups should always be perfect. Try to reduce the number of variables that could fuck up your game in order to see the most measurable gains in skill over time. I think one of the best pieces of advice someone ever gave me was to always back out of every lobby once the game is over. It gives you some time to cool down after a match, gives you ample time to adjust a class, and even more time to re-center your mind after a game. Also, if you stay in the same lobby for too long, instead of getting better at the game, you're actually getting better at beating one specific group of players with certain playstyles.   I'm sure you don't have a problem with this as an avid counter-strike player, but don't worry about losing, only worry about your performance from game to game. There's enough players playing CoD right now that the matchmaking system usually gives you pretty skill-consistent games so jumping in and out of lobbies won't fuck with a normal player skill distribution too much. Pick one or two things to focus on from game to game to improve upon. ""I'd like to be able to beat 5 guys on gunfights alone this match"" It's not so hard when you give yourself a measurable goal.   The name of the game is practice, always just keep playing and you'll just get better over time. I guess I went on an improvement tangent but whatever, someone will see it and find it useful."

BO2 is still pretty active is definitely the best PC CoD since 4. AW is a pretty decent port as well but from what I hear it's got performance issues, some maps running like total shit for many people. I don't play AW on PC (though I would if I could, can't stand playing shooters on console, but I don't currently have a good gaming PC).  This series should be legendary on PC. All they need to do is bring back dedicated servers with a server browser as well as modding support along with the PC centric options of BO2 and AW and I swear this series could be huge on PC again.

CallOfDuty,3cbb3a,ExoEvolved,6,Mon Jul 6 16:55:34 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking of doing a guide for it on Youtube; it's all about knifing but also maximising the number of bullets you fire into a zombie with you're M1911 before you knife them. For example, if I buy an Olympia and just run around killing zombies I'm gonna get about 60 points for each zombie killed and maybe 100 if I'm doing headshots, whereas if I fire 5 rounds into a zombie and knife them I'm getting 10 for each bullet and 130 for the knife meaning for the exact same zombie I could have gotten 60 points for I'm getting 180, you start with about 40 bullets so right off the bat you're getting 400 points from the pistol and if you get a max amo it's another 80 bullets in total so 800 potential points.  In this case there was also some EXTREME luck involved, I got a max amo as well as double points and an insta kill, not to mention crossing the mystery box and getting the Raygun first try - but in general the best thing to do is cautiously knife one zombie at a time."

I have tweaked my play in AW based on variants of different weapons and that makes it very interesting and fresh. The same map, same weapon, but different variant will require a different approach. However, I do strongly agree that if someone has a weapon variant much like Obsidian Steed or Speakeasy, there is nothing much to do rather than lie down and kill your self. However, I've enjoyed thinking of how to kill the players with better weapons .. A little more satisfying, dont you think ?? ;)"

CallOfDuty,3c606w,kirbaaaay,3,Sun Jul 5 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"Well for one, games evolve. Call of Duty is call of duty, but none of the multiplayers will feel the exact same year to year. Which is good. There's enough gamer fatigue as it is.   The problem I have with your post is that you assume that the gameplay of CoD4 is ""call of duty gameplay."" And that none of the games since then feel like call of duty. The problem with that is that it's completely 100% subjective. Who are you to define what feels like call of duty and what doesn't? Every cod game I've played feels very similar -- they all feel like CoD. I completely disagree with your claim that they could all be released as IPs and be different. Even with the boost jumping and dodging and such, AW still looks and feels like a CoD game. It plays differently than every other game, but that's a great way to eliminate (or at least minimize) game fatigue."
CallOfDuty,3c606w,jacob2815,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with your praise for BO2, but I guess I should explain my stance first.  I look at MW2 as the highlight of the series for two reasons:   It expanded upon the fantastic MW1 and gave us an ""upgraded"" version of it. Granted, there were some gameplay flaws (spawns when team has gunner/AC130) and some broken perks (Commando, OMA/DC) but overall, the game was the best IMO. The P2P connections in MW2 was among the best ever. I'm not sure what voodoo they put into the netcode, but no CoD, except maybe Ghosts, has come close to what MW2 did for P2P connections. Wherever I shot, my bullets hit. If I was behind a wall, 99% of the time I was safe and didn't die to Wanted curving bullets. I didn't need to dump 30 rounds into 2 people for them both to die. The game ran smoothly and if a shitty host was chosen, the game would switch to the next best host and gameplay was seamless from there on out.   Now we move to BO2. Good lord the connections in this game are complete garbage. To this day, I still can't understand the glowing praise for BO2. It has some of the worst connections to date (along with MW3 and AW) and the scorestreaks can be abused to get those famous 400 kill games as seen on youtube. Not saying that they can't be abused in MW2, but BO2 has many more 300+ kill videos than MW2 has.  The other thing I don't understand is the constant bashing that Ghosts takes from the community. Is the game perfect? Absolutely not, the whole prestige system is messed up due to squad point hoarding, although I did like that I could unlock the perks I wanted, when I wanted and not have to wait for certain ranks. Is the game fun? Subjective. I find the game fun because it's my skill against my opponent's skill in a very evenly matched game. The upper kill streaks were a bit weak (except helo gunner + Loki) but I can see how IW wanted to stress more gunplay versus their last iteration MW3 which heavily favored OP air streaks that wiped everyone out. Not to mention that the connections in Ghosts far exceeded any installment after MW2 and fixed the ""blank bullet"" issue that plagued the prior titles. While this may have led to quicker TTK, I was willing to accept that in order to have a more technically-sound game. Overall, if I give MW2 a 10/10, I'd give Ghosts a 8.5/10 due to the quality of gameplay and connection improvements being more valuable than the ""cool"" boost-jumping in today's AW or the lagfest that is BO2."
CallOfDuty,3c606w,mrozzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest reasons we won't see a CoD4-esque game is because the majority of players are used to having customization and infinite gun options, and are very vocal about that. The devs continue to add more into each game, so players are used to having a thousand guns and attachments. You can actually see the repercussions with Titanfall. By far the smoothest FPS since CoD4 on consoles (I was in FPS heaven playing Titanfall), but it was largely hated on for it's ""lack of customization and gun choices."" While having less options leads to a better balanced game, players want more junk to choose from, even if it throws off the balance. CoD4 was simple and barebones, much like CS:GO, which is why both titles are fantastic for competitive play. But CoD keeps growing in scope, and that causes the game to be more cluttered.   And I disagree with BO2 feeling most like CoD4. MW3 felt more like it. MW3 is the best selling CoD to date, so that says something for the game. Plus it's hella fun.   MW2 had potential to be the best CoD, and harbored some of the best connections, but the game was severely broken (and still is). It was largely unplayable, and those who call it the best do so out of nostalgia. It was plagued with gamebreaking issues (OMA noobtube, Dual 1887, care package glitch, javelin glitch, commando, easy to earn OP killstreaks, tac insert boosting, extreme sound whoring, heart moniters.) These issues were present for months, and some never got patched at all.   I honestly don't know how people claim it to be the best CoD. I rank CoD4, BO2, BO1, and MW3 above it for playability. If you don't believe me, go back and play for 2 or 3 hours. The same shit still goes on today.  Ghosts is a perfectly good game, and I still play it regularly. The biggest issue it had was the larger, circular maps which promoted camping with thermals. And IED's. Don't get me started.   A lot of this is opinion, mind you, but as a veteran player I feel it's accurate."
CallOfDuty,3c606w,KindOfOk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"IMHO the true successor to COD4 is Ghosts. I know it had a few issues, but they also fixed a lot of things and didn't push for the usual overpowered killstreaks and such.  I still play COD4 though, no other FPS has ever felt so good to me (Titanfall was close, but it's a different kind of game)."

I don't think they would continue the Ghosts series after all the hate they got from the last game, but anything is possible, really.  I wouldn't mind seeing a new series as well. I just hope they don't bring back Modern Warfare. I totally loved the MW series, but you have to realize that the IW back then is not the same IW that exists today. I'm worried they would take MW in a different direction and damage it's name. Not because it's bad, but because it's different."
CallOfDuty,3c4hwj,invudontseeme,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% with you. I loved Ghosts and still can't understand the hate it gets. People complain about the TTK, but never bothered to watch any videos about ""lag compensation"" for Ghosts and realize that it's the lowest it's been in a long time, plus the removal of ""blank rounds"" is what caused the relatively fast TTK. I think that if Ghosts was to go back to the prestige system, but keep the unlock-what-you-want during that prestige, tweak the killstreaks to make them more effective and improve the matchmaking to do ping-based matchmaking rather than location-based, I think the game would be perfect.  The problem is people are in love with BO2 and want that to be every game. They prefer a shiny, cool looking turd that has garbage connections rather than a technically-sound game like MW2 or Ghosts, to an extent, which is why the series might take a nose dive to cater to those people."
CallOfDuty,3c4hwj,mrozzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"BO2 was not a ""shiny, cool looking turd"", it was a competently developed game with EXCELLENT map design, great gun balance, and loads of innovations along all three game modes. It also had actual fun factor.  Ghosts took every innovation that BO2 made, threw it out the window and made another cookie-cutter, seen it all before CoD game with absolutely fucking garbage map design, terrible design decisions, and straight up boring gameplay. I'm always open to opinions, but Ghosts is the one and only game in this series that I will tell someone that they are downright wrong for liking. If you like Ghosts, you like badly designed games, simple as that. Ghosts may have had better hit detection, but every other aspect of it was total shit. It's just a really bad game."

Hopefully they take a ton of cues from Black Ops 3, which really sounds like it's taking a lot of steps in the right direction. Especially the campaign mode.   The campaign mode where you create your own character and unlock guns and equipment and such on your own and you choose your load out every mission instead of getting given random stuff. There's an XP progression system in campaign too, as well as co-op. No more train on rails boring campaign gameplay that everyone hates. Every mission is an arena style mission -- you get spawned in on a big map with a ton of shit on it and an objective or a bunch, and you choose how you complete it. No more being forced to go around guns blazing or sneak around with a silenced sniper rifle. If you want, that's how you can compete every mission. Or, you can go in guns blazing every time. Or however you damn well please. Now there's the kind of innovation that we need. This change multiplies the campaign's replaybility tenfold. You can play it multiple times with different styles of character with different ways of doing things, like many people do in games like Elder Scrolls or Fallout. And you can do it with friends.  As for multiplayer, the gunsmith/paintjob features as well as specialists and the thrusting all seem like minor but very innovative features that add to the classic multiplayer gameplay that we all know and love, without changing it drastically the way AW did. There's no secret that cod gameplay was getting kind of stale. This is a great way to change it up without ruining it.   And zombies, we don't know for sure, but there is some sort of narrative as well as an XP progression system.   I want IW to make those sorts of innovations. At least, I hope they copy the style of campaign exactly and that they bring in the gunsmith feature."

BO2 is all the proof you need to see that Treyarch knows what the hell they're doing. BO3 is the first CoD game I've been truly looking forward to since BO2. This game is going to be damn good, it's pretty much a guarantee going by their track record."

Sure you might get a few million new players, but you'd lose a large majority of the players who buy the game every year.   CoD might not be at the height it was during MW2 through Black Ops 2, but it's not about to crash and burn any second. According to Polygon, Advanced Warfare was still the highest selling game of 2014. I'd be willing to put money on Black Ops 3 being either the #1 or #2 top selling game of 2015. The formula still works, people still buy the game, and people still love the game. For every person you see bitching and moaning about how boring CoD is and how the series hasn't gone anywhere in years, there's 1000 more people playing the game and enjoying it. A big change like this would alienate the core Call of Duty fanbase and Activision would most likely lose a lot of money."
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,MotoHD,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:09:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out the fact that Call of Duty has been declining sales year-on-year since MW3 in 2011. Sure they are still #1, but that reign is going to end very, very soon."
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,kumquatz71,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I previously thought Black Ops 2 was the highest selling based on how well it sold on release. Turns out MW3 is in fact the highest selling CoD game. Black Ops 2 wasn't far behind. My other points still stand though    Ghosts and AW failed to capture people's attention. However, Black Ops 3 preorders are way way up from the previous two years (the number I've been seeing is around 750k already). If the beta for Black Ops 3 goes well, we could very well see an increase in Call of Duty sales for the first time since 2012. Personally, I trust Treyarch to make good games. They're the gold standard for CoD developers now, and it's up to them to save Call of Duty at this point.   If Black Ops 3 flops, Call of Duty can't be saved if you ask me and like you said, it might still be #1 for a while, but that reign will end soon."
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,MotoHD,7,Tue Jul 7 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think they really need to go that extreme. They need to stick with the Call of Duty feel. If they went out and changed it to a MMO type game, most hardcore CoD players wouldn't play."
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,geauxandy72,3,Sun Jul 5 15:00:11 2015 UTC,"/u/MotoHD hit the nail on the head with his answer.   Your idea is a horrible, HORRIBLE idea. If they do what you do, they should just stop making Call of Duty games and make a new IP with the same premise as what you say. Because what you suggested is NOT call of duty at all. It may be how it started (the idea of ww2 soldiers answering the call of duty), but it has evolved to be so much more than that. And the whole PvE zones with PvP zones in an open world game is something that most call of duty players don't enjoy at all."
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,jacob2815,4,Sun Jul 5 16:44:19 2015 UTC,Great idea. CoD has become stale so let's change it to be just like a different game.  Fucking people in this sub are so goddamn stupid.

However, I do think an overhall of the setting would be fantastic, I think many fans are sick and tired of the whole ""future-technology-turning-against-us"" thing that the past three games have used as a backdrop. WWII would be an amazing setting for a new COD, however, they'd really have to make it new and innovative. (Maybe the soldiers have cool parkour abilities, or something idk?) I'm not a fan of the future setting, so I really think a COD game based somewhere in the 20th century would be awesome"
CallOfDuty,3c6fek,Dmont_C_Thomas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:23 2015 UTC,"CoD is far from stale. Just look at the preorder numbers for BO3. It has roughly 750k preorders already. If the beta goes well, those numbers will increase drastically. It may not be fresh for you, but every year there are new kids being introduced to the series for the first time. It may not be what it was 7 years ago, but kids who were in diapers then are playing the game now. CoD is still a juggernaut in the FPS genre and until numbers drastically fall, I doubt there will be a massive overhaul. It is possible one of the three studios decides to take a different approach, if Activision green-lights it. Time will tell."

CallOfDuty,3bws4g,Bizzy666,11,Thu Jul 2 20:08:00 2015 UTC,Definitely not AW.
CallOfDuty,3bws4g,rhcp88,9,Thu Jul 2 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"Black Ops 1 Had the best zombies experience IMO. Plus, you can get all 4 WaW maps on it."
CallOfDuty,3bws4g,VexBlue,2,Thu Jul 2 20:12:35 2015 UTC,I agree. Black ops 1 and 2 would keep you busy with zombies for a while.

CallOfDuty,3bws4g,mikethefish,2,Fri Jul 3 15:47:29 2015 UTC,I would get black ops and buy the moon dlc because it comes with all four of the waw maps remastered and the dlc is only $5 where the black ops dlc's are $15

CallOfDuty,3bws4g,The_Legend_98_99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:50:57 2015 UTC,I'd say black ops because if you get all of the dlc for it or at least just the Rezurrection dlc because with that dlc pack you get Moon and all of the WaW zombie maps.

Activision CEO said they are always interested in making money. They just need a team to make the game because they are focused on new games not remaking the old ones.

I made this and during that game I repeatadly told I was going to be booted offline.  I don't understand it because all trickshotters seem to have the same outlook, if you don't stand there and let them shoot you your sweaty and you need to get a life. Yet they are the ones dancing around trying to get a pretty killcam.   What's wrong with setting up a private game and doing it with your fellow trickshotters? Instead of crying because you just got killed by a reg gun in a public lobby.   The same goes for anyone who whines about dying to be honest.   It's the attitude of superiority that I hate."
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Clemoo,9,Mon Jun 29 23:30:38 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely. I'm a trickshotter my self but almost every other one I've run into has this outlook. Why would you be surprised or angry that someone in search or FFA is playing normally?
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Detective_Bong_Hits,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"The clips trickshotters need have to be in public match.

The reasons you can't set up in private match is it doesn't count, because its easy. Nobody cares if its in private match. Would soccer be interesting if one team stood still while the other scored? No. They act superior for a reason. Hitting a trickshot is a great feeling. It takes more skill, focus, and luck than almost anything in cod."
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Clemoo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:47:02 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't make them 'superior' in anyway other than in trickshotting.   Getting an ace in SnD is a great feeling and also requires all the things you listed and more, against reg players anyway, but when it happens I don't act superior, of if i die during a good run the vast majority of the time it would be down to being out played, but for some reason trickshotters generally feel they should be excluded from that."
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,laxmanchip,14,Tue Jun 30 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"because trickshotters are typically dipshit little kids who tell enemy players to ""stop trying so hard"", ""drink bleach"", and ""kill yourself."""

CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Hazzehh,3,Tue Jun 30 13:16:13 2015 UTC,"Because when they're on my team they drag us down, and when they're on the enemy team, it's no fun because I have less enemies to actually fight and they pad the score.

CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Hazzehh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:48:05 2015 UTC,Chances are if its just one guy trickshotting by himself in TDM or KC or any other 6v6 game type for that matter they're not real trickshotters and have no clue what they're doing.
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,Hazzehh,3,Fri Jul 3 06:42:52 2015 UTC,Don't see the point in spending 10 games straight jumping and doing 360 no scopes just for a 5 second clip. Do you think that makes you look good? No it fucking doesn't it makes you look like an idiot that's just wasted a bunch of time for a clip that no one cares about.
CallOfDuty,3bkgtd,OhBoyItsDann,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:07:13 2015 UTC,"So because trickshotters ""waste"" their own time for something they have fun doing you don't like them? Also it's way more complicated than a 360 no scope"

If I have a shitty connection (three bar) I sometimes barely go positive or even negative... Connection is half the battle.   Edit:  one more thing, you have to be crazy aggressive.

If anyone has paid any attention to any cod commentators on youtube who got to play the game early you will know they said it feels nearly identical to Blops 2 just with added movement and class customization. Even most pig the score streaks and weapons are returning or have similar counterparts.

Probably because there wasn't an excessive amount of killstreaks etc, back then.  Please give us WaW2 (I was hoping for it this year) or at least give us CoD4/WaW without hacked servers on consoles."

CallOfDuty,3bdu19,T_Peg,8,Sun Jun 28 15:19:35 2015 UTC,Do a pushup every time you die
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,adamfps,3,Sun Jun 28 15:51:24 2015 UTC,well I'll get better irl but I can't picture it helping much in game but I guess it's worth a shot
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,T_Peg,2,Sun Jun 28 15:56:17 2015 UTC,"It did great for me and a lot of others. Say every game you die 10+ times that's 10 push ups a game. Not a lot at first but you get to the point they start to hurt and you think to yourself when you're about to check a corner blind or run into the open ""is it worth doing this stupid risky move?""   Two things result form this A) you get good at COD and stop dying as much and get more kills B) you still suck at COD but have some chest-game for people to mire'"

CallOfDuty,3bdu19,T_Peg,0,Mon Jun 29 04:22:49 2015 UTC,Ahaha Thanks. People often do the same things and you can predict where people are and look at the minimap
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,Fapplet,3,Mon Jun 29 08:05:38 2015 UTC,"You have to think like the enemy. Observe what part of the map is your team mostly on and what part of the map looks like where the enemy would be spawning from. Approach each corner cautiously, ready to ADS when needed. Also a useful tip is not running when approaching corners/doorways since you'll have the drop on players who do. Don't stay out in the open, observe your surroundings and watch where teammates die, so you get a clue as to where the enemy may be."
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,TheDudeWhoCommented,4,Sun Jun 28 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"Hit the nail right on the head.  The more you play the more you will be able to predict where the enemy is coming from. Being observant, knowing the map, knowing where you team is and where they are covering, and knowing where the enemy will be coming from will put you at a huge advantage.  And yes, DON'T SPRINT. I love sprinters, so easy to kill."

I always keep moving. Not rushing, but not camping either. I patrol an area and check all my corners. But mostly by watching other people do I pick up tricks and habits on how to play well."
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,T_Peg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:06:19 2015 UTC,I really should do more watching thanks!
CallOfDuty,3bdu19,VeryShagadelic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"Don't win through superior fire skill, but through superior map movement. You don't want to engage in gun fights, but you'd rather shoot 'em in the back before they can react. Learn spawn points, popular camping spots and choke points, so that you always have the drop on your opponents.   I was never that good in Call of Duty in terms of shooting ability (a little above average at best), but through game knowledge I've managed to hold a 2.0 kda in the past."

CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,PM_ME_Y0UR_PR0BLEMS,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:24:32 2015 UTC,"i assume you're talking about on xb1?  the way they would have to implement backwards compatibility for xb360 games on xb1 is that the system would have to support the game exactly as is.  this would mean that the game would appear pretty much the same as if you were running on xb360 to everything outside of your network.  in other words, unless they put in the effort to try to prevent it from working once microsoft gets it working, it should work."
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,cowvin,2,Sun Jun 28 07:24:20 2015 UTC,MS already has the emulator ready and working but they need the approval of publisher to release games
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,im_dany,2,Sun Jun 28 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Xbox team needs permission from activision to put the games on. So they don't need to do any work to prevent it, they just have to say no."
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,jacob2815,3,Sun Jun 28 18:59:45 2015 UTC,I can't see them doing it to be honest. Mass Effect is reportedly running at 15fps so if COD runs at 30 fps it will be a very shit experience. That and there are rumours of a HD collection in the works as well.
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,Hazzehh,-1,Sun Jun 28 07:43:17 2015 UTC,agreed.  i don't think the xb1 is beefy enough to emulate xb360 games at full framerate.  =(
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,cowvin,-1,Sun Jun 28 08:11:12 2015 UTC,"It's not running at 15 fps, it just looks like that because of how it was originally rendered on the 360 version is different in how frames are rendered on the one version."
CallOfDuty,3bdlbj,Decayse,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:08:08 2015 UTC,Someone used a program that records frame rate mate sorry to burst your bubble

CallOfDuty,3b2vss,ronaldraygun91,4,Thu Jun 25 18:31:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's good but it's also very bare bones and plenty like the other cods feel better. I also dislike the pacing in AW but my point is that saying cod 4 isn't number 1 because of stupid kids is dumb as hell"
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,Fapplet,3,Thu Jun 25 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"Simple can do just fine. Think about CS:GO. It also works well for the competitive scene, which I know, not everyone cares about. We are all going to have different opinions but I think most of us agree that AW was sub-par. :D"
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,ronaldraygun91,2,Thu Jun 25 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"For sure. I think mw2 had the best setup. Pro perks, weapons with attachments but not too many, reasonable challenges, simple kill streaks but lots of them, etc. man I hope mw2 gets backwards compatibility"
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,wavs101,3,Thu Jun 25 20:26:43 2015 UTC,AW is weird. I bought it and played it for 2 hours and stopped
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,ronaldraygun91,8,Thu Jun 25 18:35:48 2015 UTC,The movement is too much for me. I want a simple gun fight not a unreal tournament call of duty
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,wavs101,2,Thu Jun 25 18:38:44 2015 UTC,Did you like ghosts then?
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,ronaldraygun91,2,Fri Jun 26 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm, sort of. It had its pluses but the time to kill was too fast and that kind of ruined it for me. Balance was iffy with certain stuff too"
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,wavs101,2,Fri Jun 26 02:52:08 2015 UTC,So you would like cod to be slower? Black ops 2?
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,ronaldraygun91,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:23:31 2015 UTC,Black ops 2 was pretty solid in terms of speed. I'm torn between mw2 and blops 2 in terms of what I'd really like for the speed and ttk for blops 3. What about you?
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,jacobscottnolan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:34:38 2015 UTC,"Black ops 2 was my favourite game by far! I heard that black ops 3 feels like black ops 2, but it has a slightly faster time to kill, maybe 10%-15%. Which is ok, because it would still be slower than ghosts and advanced warfare."

CoD games are some of the LAST games I'd ask for backcompat on. I'm sure a lot of these people voting for it are thinking ""Oh, if you can play CoD4 on the Xbone, tons of people will start playing it again!""   I ask these people to please, go borrow the Halo MCC edition from a friend, and try to find a match for Halo 3 during non prime time. Being able to play the old game on a new console did NOT erectness the game. It won't for CoD either. I'd much rather see a long SP game that I KNOW I'll be able to play, instead of an MP game that will have a jump in online community for two weeks only to die right back down."

CallOfDuty,3b2vss,TekLWar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:59:44 2015 UTC,Or at least remaster this and let us play it on new servers again.
CallOfDuty,3b2vss,Fapplet,0,Sat Jun 27 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"WoodysGamertag often said that if activsion realsed CoD4 now people would not like it, although I agree it's because most cod players now are just swagfag people that watch optic and like vines on Facebook and Instagram. He says that people always complain about CoD and he said that Black Ops 2 was the best CoD game. It really wasn't. It had horbile lag. It was plain and boring and shit. CoD4 is still active on PC and it's simple and easy. A few more tweaks and it's the perfect competitive game and multiplayer game for friends. I still play raw CoD4 till this day."
CallOfDuty,3b4xay,wadeight,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"probably AW and BO2 have the most people playing. There are no player counts for AW so nobody really knows how many players that game has, but apparently BO2 still has a lot"

CallOfDuty,3b0zbz,theirv15,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:25:33 2015 UTC,Watch any gameplay from E3 and they explain the specialist. You have to choose between the ability or weapon and you only earn it 2-3 times a game. Nothing game breaking.

I know the dissenting opinions are from the people there since COD 4,  which they say that was the beginning. I guess the previous 3 games don't count. But I guess it's an improvement from the chaos that is Advanced Warfare. Yes the boost jumping is there, but it's only there for the wall running."

CallOfDuty,3avmy5,dexb0t,4,Wed Jun 24 14:21:04 2015 UTC,Simpler the better. I don't mind the killstreaks its just that there are so many. The 3-5-7 was good and they could just expand that to 9-11-13 etc with the killstrekas getting better I hate all those gimmick killstreaks.

CallOfDuty,3avmy5,notreallysrs,3,Thu Jun 25 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is so many people now are saying how annoying the futuristic elements to the new AW and BO3. But before this everyone was extremely annoyed by the modern setting getting over done. In fact I remember when World At War came out everyone was complaining that WWII was to over done and that they wanted another modern warfare game.  Everyone now complains there is to much change, but from BO1 to ghost complained that there was not enough change.  I think another world war 2, korean war, or possibly world war 1 game would be good to change things up. But I can already see everyone complaining that...  A. The game is to slow now. Remember when they had the futuristic elements and you could do all the cool movements.  or  B.  The game is exactly the same except all the guns are semi auto or bolt action. or  C. Cod sucks now! I was playing it when it wasn't as popular.   So what counts as a good and meaningful change? I am honestly curious."

CallOfDuty,3avef7,parpparpparp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"It left a superb balance in call of duty. If everyone in the world uses stopping power, it pushes everyone else to use stopping power because you have to use it to compete. So in order to use a class without stopping power, you have to sacrifice damage. Sacrifice stopping power for speed, etc."
CallOfDuty,3avef7,RelativeMinors,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree. Sure everyone used it, but that's because there was really no other competition in the red perk. UAV jammer was used a little bit it was far easier to do well with stopping power. If one perk is way better than the other options, that's the opposite of balance."
CallOfDuty,3avef7,parpparpparp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"Stopping power is by no means better, you just have to be better at the game to be consistent with a class that doesn't have stopping power."

CallOfDuty,3aqnyj,S_cute,5,Mon Jun 22 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"Well as for the playlist thing I believe its one of those more playlists = less players in each. And headquarters in MW3 sucked ass juice tittymilk. They take the most popular gamemodes and make them hardcore. Now they focus more on competitive aspects of the game leaving hardcore sucking dick on the corner for ramen noodles.  As for map incorporation, I believe that they added a hardcore mosh pit for the new maps when they came out in ghosts just like core. Fairly sure they were added the same as core. I didn't buy dlc for aw because...lets be real"
CallOfDuty,3aqnyj,tgr31,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I typically don't buy the DLC in general because I think the maps are just not as good as the default ones. I also can't justify $60 for more maps. With the first DLC for AW, the maps didn't come out to HC right away, not even in a moshpit scenario.   Back to the playlist though, yeah I understand the whole more playlist = less players in each. Makes perfect sense. But like I said, would it be horrible if they added a little more variety. I'm a fan of objective based games, being a hardcore player, I only get to choose from Domination or Search and Destroy. I think the problem with HQ on MW3 was that MW3 was MW3 and MW3 was no good.   Add two more objective based games, like HQ, CTF, Demolition. Something along those lines. I don't think you need to transfer the ""new"" game types like Uplink & company, but return some of the classics. I don't think it would dilute the number of players in a list that much."

It was genuinely more enjoyable than Cod 4 for me. It improved upon what Cod 4 brought to the table and more. The things you list aren't gameplay focused, like weapon handling and enjoyability.

CallOfDuty,3alh7p,CriticalBeard,18,Sun Jun 21 13:23:57 2015 UTC,Probably my top pick for remastering.
CallOfDuty,3alh7p,JPSurratt2005,15,Sun Jun 21 13:38:08 2015 UTC,Absolutely. My top 2 remastered would be WaW and MW1. The rest can pretty much stay on the old gen consoles.
CallOfDuty,3alh7p,CriticalBeard,14,Sun Jun 21 13:48:27 2015 UTC,I really miss those MW1 maps.   Back before they esports influence made maps mirrors of themselves.

CallOfDuty,3alh7p,mifflinity,2,Sun Jun 21 21:30:20 2015 UTC,I can't see them making ALL CoD's as one bundle but split among developers. MW bundle and BO bundle. I would hope they would be priced differently since they would have different games but hell i would pay full price for all dlc and a remake of only BO2 or MW1/2. My perfect bundle would be MW1/2 and BO2 but that would make 0 sense unless they just did a fan-favorite bundle or something off the wall.

CallOfDuty,3amkdk,InfectedP0tato,6,Mon Jun 22 06:17:31 2015 UTC,Bo2 is the best game after mw3. Ghosts is complete shit  AW is pretty good imo but lots of people give AW shit for being innovative but I fund it fun.  As long as they don't bring exos into new CODs and bo3 doesn't count because it's nothing like exo movements.

CallOfDuty,3amkdk,mifflinity,2,Mon Jun 22 21:36:56 2015 UTC,I would definitley recommend Drift0r for quality information and just a relaxed kind of guy. Tmartn and Ali-A just dump out crappy click-bait articles and turn them into their own videos. I tend to watch them just to get a visual way to get caught up on anything interesting but as for a quality video there are way better out there. Pamaj is still pretty big into only playing CoD but he is starting to look more for entertainment rather then awesome clips.
CallOfDuty,3amkdk,EzzOmen,4,Mon Jun 22 05:23:47 2015 UTC,"You've got the obvious hardcore Call of Duty audience, such as TmarTn, Chaosxsilencer and Ali-A, they upload almost everyday, and usually talk about practically any piece of information on new or existing Call of Duty Games. Drift0r is a great youtuber, he does very good commentary for his videos, but he doesn't upload as much as the rest, maybe once or twice every few days (although due to E3 he's uploading a lot of content as of right now) and on a more casual side; 402THUNDER402 plays Black Ops 2 more than Ghosts and AW, but he's still a good youtuber, even if he does upload Destiny videos sometimes (which is great for me since i love both, but if you're looking for solely CoD, the first three are your best bets)"
CallOfDuty,3amkdk,mvcvluso,4,Sun Jun 21 22:11:54 2015 UTC,100% Scumpii. hes the best skill wise & the least annoying imo. or nadeshots videos. theyre both insanely good players. pamaj is too but hes a weird canadian kid

Drift0r is good for info. TheMarkOfJ is beast like previously stated. but you have to be careful who you watch because most out there arent real on how horrible the game actually is. the people that get invited to COD events are maybe the fakest commentators such as ali-a and tmrtn. if you want real check out JiveTurkey and 402Thunder402. also fist2cufs.

CallOfDuty,3aoofh,IISGOAT,3,Tue Jun 23 02:05:44 2015 UTC,You can start development beforehand and still take ideas from others later on. You think they had black ops 3 done by the time titanfall released? Absolutely not.
CallOfDuty,3aoofh,IISGOAT,0,Mon Jun 22 15:29:02 2015 UTC,I know but the devs get the ideas done then make the game. I believe they knew they wanted a more fast paced game before they started making the game.
CallOfDuty,3aoofh,steve230yeah,3,Mon Jun 22 16:22:49 2015 UTC,The game looks and plays like titanfall. You can't deny that. I think Activision sees titanfall as a threat to their gaming base so there trying to make a superior product to take titanfall out.
CallOfDuty,3aoofh,SlipperySimian,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:25 2015 UTC,they way i look at it is that they are very capable of adding and removing features. they say that the community hates boosting so they slowed it down. now it looks like destiny. the specialist imo is a copy of destiny. i mean a one shot pistol and a super melee to the ground...get real. wall runing seriously doesnt need to be in the game. COD has lost all originality if you ask majority of the community.

CallOfDuty,3ajdxs,zainkhan886,11,Sat Jun 20 19:48:32 2015 UTC,It's just in general a much more enjoyable game to play and I'm sure the sub reddit will agree. Ask anyone and they will say bo2. It's just a better balanced game in comparison.
CallOfDuty,3ajdxs,5t4k3,5,Sat Jun 20 20:01:17 2015 UTC,Agree. Black ops 2 is the best (imo). But cod4 is another fan favorite.
CallOfDuty,3ajdxs,ElvisToast,-1,Sun Jun 21 01:04:39 2015 UTC,Bo2 was the least enjoyable. All the maps felt the same and the cruise ship came up half the time. Bo1 was good

But I don't care as long as the zombies is as good as BO1 (2 was very disappointing in that) and the quickscoping is somehow limited (like in 1 to where it wasn't impossible to snipe but you couldn't go around the map with it either)."
CallOfDuty,3afqhz,danyaiel,7,Fri Jun 19 19:52:35 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you can say it's not as good as hyped from watching ONE pre alpha game play. Just wait till you play it for a bit then come out and say if you feel it's over hyped or not.

CallOfDuty,3afqhz,WarEagle33x,6,Fri Jun 19 20:23:56 2015 UTC,I think it's better to play the game and get a feel rather than try to figure out how it will run based on what we see.
CallOfDuty,3afqhz,digital-atheist,-2,Fri Jun 19 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not going to end up buying it but I just have to say that yes it does look like titanfall, but maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. From what I've heard titanfall is a great game but it has absolutely no content for it at all, and when the first DLC came for it it seems the game just got left in the dark. And while I personally am not a huge fan of BO2 (though I do play it every so often), it's still one of the most populated CoDs and it was released 3 years ago (granted ghosts and AW were disappointments). Every game is going to copy something off of a different series, but that isn't always a bad thing if it's done right, which for BO3 it looks like it'll hardly be a feature at all."
CallOfDuty,3afqhz,digital-atheist,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"see, that's sad. you didn't check it out because other people told you not to? It still has a nice population on Xbox one. Averages around 6k players a day. You'll have no problems finding games.   It's the FPS i've played in a very long time. It's deep man. The learning curve is bigger than that of any COD game. It's fast as hell and really twitchy. The movement is by far the best out of any current shooter (including AW and Halo 5).   Check it out dude. BLOP3 looks to have nothing on it."

Have you touched the gore setting before? Did you set it to restricted? Try setting it to restricted and back again, see if that works. I know you said you tried rocket strikes, but remember that not all weapons cause gibbing (bayonetting just causes a blood splatter, and only heavier weapons like machine guns, shotguns, and the PTRS-41+ explosives cause gore). Try a mission like Their Land, Their Blood that has weapons such as the MG42 and FG42. Those weapons are gore machines and WILL gib people.

CallOfDuty,3ab7j7,BustinBoots,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:29:56 2015 UTC,uhhh... backwards compatibility...
CallOfDuty,3ab7j7,MatrixSez,3,Thu Jun 18 23:07:07 2015 UTC,Not all games are being made available for backwards compatibility. Just ones that Xbox chooses
CallOfDuty,3ab7j7,BustinBoots,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:19:04 2015 UTC,pretty much guarantee mw2 will eventually be approved for backwards compatibility.

CallOfDuty,3ab7j7,BustinBoots,2,Sat Jun 20 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm almost 100% sure they won't bring back guns from other developers. Though if you look at the trailers/gameplay they did bring back reloads, which basically means the same gun with a new skin..."
CallOfDuty,3ab7j7,l3utters,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"reloads don't really mean the same gun with a new skin, the stats could be very different. I think that white burst rifle in BO3 has the MTAR's reload, and it looks like it doesn't function very similarly. It's the same way that they could bring back something like the M4A1, that looks identical to the MW3 version, but functions entirely differently as a high damage semi-auto rifle or something."

CallOfDuty,3adjlj,Vault92FTW,7,Sun Jun 21 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Not yet, but when they announced backwards compatibility, their main picture on the Xbox One dashboard had Halo Reach and tons of other multiplayer games in it. Also, official vid on the Xbox One even confirmed we can do multiplayer."
CallOfDuty,3adjlj,muskrat42,-14,Fri Jun 19 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but by the time it is all ironed out we will be in a new generation of consoles and nobody will care about 360 on 1"

CallOfDuty,3adjlj,Weenercopter,2,Fri Jun 19 06:47:40 2015 UTC,And new games are being added every month until release which is this holiday

CallOfDuty,3adjlj,ExTinkt,9,Fri Jun 19 06:27:48 2015 UTC,I don't think you have any clue what you're talking about.

Yes. It will happen. That's what people are so hyped about.  (I hate that godforsaken n00bt00b OMA fest, but I'm excited for other games.)"
CallOfDuty,3adjlj,creativeindeed,3,Fri Jun 19 14:52:55 2015 UTC,The new backwards compatibility feature literally emulates the 360 so you will be able to play any game that has multiplayer features with people on the Xbox 360 as well.
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,Vizuka,6,Wed Jun 17 21:31:41 2015 UTC,No they're not necessary or worth it at this point. Too late.

CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,ProNewbie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:28:53 2015 UTC,According to steamcharts.com he's better off getting BLOPS2 as there's 6000 people playi NV and AW only has 500.  But the 30 day average for both has seen a decline in player numbers.
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,DakiniBrave,3,Thu Jun 18 16:13:43 2015 UTC,Zombies....
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,ILikePuhtaytoes,6,Wed Jun 17 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't enjoy it really. As my flair says, BO1 had better. It was less complicated and more enjoyable imo."
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,ImperialDoor,8,Wed Jun 17 23:48:18 2015 UTC,Nah WaW had the best multiplayer and zombies out of the three.
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,jimskog99,3,Thu Jun 18 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"Best multiplayer? Definitely. Best Campaign? Definitely (co-op!) Best zombies? Not necessarily. The engine/gameplay feels too outdated, as much as I love WaW, zombies was a better experience (besides mods which shouldn't be counted) in BO1. I'm still mid decision about BO2 zombies (just bought it and all dlc only for the zombies), but think it has its merits."
CallOfDuty,3a7n4i,DakiniBrave,3,Thu Jun 18 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't mods be counted, it's what made them the most enjoyable, the custom maps has been what's keeping the game alive"

CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,Julius_Alexander,11,Wed Jun 17 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't play it. But I watched the multiplayer trailer for the second time, and I have to say I'm more impressed. It seems like an improvement over the past installments. It retains the fast movement seen in AW, but it's more controlled and less chaotic. Nevertheless, I'm hoping this revives CoD."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,JeremyFitzgerald,4,Wed Jun 17 04:27:16 2015 UTC,"I would agree... It looks like the brought back COD to where it was and should have stayed... Wall Running looks weird at first, but I think I will like it."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,USMCKoontz,2,Wed Jun 17 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think it'll play like a better aw, but I think a lot of people are just kinda tired of this series, and there will be a lot of people who compare this game to other shooters around."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,N0r3m0rse,2,Thu Jun 18 00:30:38 2015 UTC,Pamaj and a lot of youtubers are saying it feels like a natural progression from bo2. It looks like it plays just like the bo2 and I'm super pumped for it!
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,mifflinity,9,Thu Jun 18 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"Titanfall didn't kill cod in fact, Titanfall shot cod, cod caught the bullet and spit it back out at titanfall and that game died."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,N0r3m0rse,4,Wed Jun 17 03:31:59 2015 UTC,I'm really not sure why you made this comment. Titan fall isn't relevant at all to the conversation. Just because there's wall running in both games doesn't make them the same. There's also wall running in mirrors edge.
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,spikus93,6,Wed Jun 17 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"I posted when there were only a few comments, some of which were talking about titanfall. Also the reason wall running is in the game is because of titanfall, mirrors edge might also have it, but titanfall is more recent and was more popular. It was also the first fps to popularize enhanced movement. That said, I don't think wall running will be a bad thing."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,N0r3m0rse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I don't think it's based on Titanfall directly, but that may have influenced it."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,spikus93,5,Wed Jun 17 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think titanfall is a cod clone, so by extension I don't think black ops is a titanfall clone, but they're more similar now than the were before objectively. I'm not really one to care if mechanics are shared, all that matters to me is whether it works or not."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,N0r3m0rse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Bo3 was in development right after bo2 dropped in 2012 and they would be 4 months into the development cycle before titan fall dropped in march of 2013. Same goes for destiny and AW, Treyarch isn't copying anyone! Even if they are, Destiny and AW both are by Activision and so is BO3."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,InfectedP0tato,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"Treyarch certainly had enough time to implement things like wall running after titanfall came out, a year and change actually and I don't know where the destiny and aw comparison came from, because I didn't make one."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,N0r3m0rse,-15,Mon Jun 22 13:57:51 2015 UTC,Looks a lot like a straight up Titanfall clone minus the Titans with a bit of that magical COD bs sprinkled on.
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,LcRohze,4,Wed Jun 17 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's how I kind of feel (but not in a bad way). I remember when Titanfall was announced, everyone was saying that it would be the game that killed Call of Duty. Obviously that didn't happen.  However, I feel like Black Ops 3 looks like the game that Titanfall should have been. Minus the titans, of course. I'm excited to get my hands on the beta."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,invudontseeme,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:51:39 2015 UTC,Any news on the beta release date?

CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,dylan96r,0,Wed Jun 17 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly interested in the game because of this but even if Titan fall didn't have variety, it definitely had balance. It was nice not thinking that you died from bullshit every other death much like Call of Duty. Then again, maybe that's why COD is addicting"
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,LcRohze,-3,Wed Jun 17 03:01:48 2015 UTC,Turns out it was sledgehammer that killed CoD.
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,prokreat,4,Wed Jun 17 05:28:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe in your opinion, but there are many people that still like AW and you have to remember sledgehammer also worked on MW3"
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,DakiniBrave,-7,Wed Jun 17 08:59:47 2015 UTC,AW is most broken CoD in history. Also least played. Just what it is...
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,prokreat,3,Wed Jun 17 12:19:00 2015 UTC,Where is your evidence to back this up?
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,DakiniBrave,-3,Wed Jun 17 12:37:57 2015 UTC,all the map glitches for starters.
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,prokreat,2,Wed Jun 17 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"MW2 was the most broken COD game in history. It had more exploits and glitches than AW could even dream of, and if you say I'm wrong then you are only making it more obvious that you have no idea what you are talking about."
CallOfDuty,3a3ytr,WarEagle33x,2,Wed Jun 17 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"yeah, that was pretty broken and lots of it remained that way. AW is right up there though. that was 5 years ago too."

It could also be an interesting place to share PC-related Black Ops 3 news. While I believe Treyarch will make a great PC version, it's undeniable that PC CoD is suffering a bit in numbers. It would be great to have a steady source of players to chat and party up with."

The exos in AW are fun for 5 minutes, until you realize they can get you across the map in 7 seconds and totally screws up map flow. Objective game modes, such as Domination, are hard to play due to the spawns constantly being swapped.  Extinction is much more fun in my opinion, but the base game only comes with 1 map and you need the other 4 DLC's in order to really get the full experience. The downside is that by having the other 4 DLC's, you're put into a player list that is significantly smaller and it's much harder to find non-TDM/Strikezone Only games.  Owning a PS4, the Ghost community fluctuates between 3000-9000 per day.  Overall, you're going to see people here bash the shit out of Ghosts and I don't think it's all necessarily true. Yes, there are some stupid things done in Ghosts such as squad prestiges which really negate the need for 'classic' prestige modes prior games had and the dog/IMS are too easy to obtain and are way too powerful for 5-kill streaks, whereas the 9+ kill streaks are relatively soft for how many kills you need to get them (i.e. Assault Juggernaut).  Also, from a techincal standpoint about lag compensation, Ghosts is much more true to the MW2 programming and when put into the right lobby, the connections in Ghosts are vastly superior to AW. The problem is that Ghosts uses the lowest ""hops"" method in order to connect you to games, so depending on your region, you may get thrown into a lobby that is two ""hops"" away, but the jump between 1 & 2 will add 150ms, whereas a local game four ""hops"" away will only add 30ms - long story short, the matchmaking system is poor in Ghosts.  TL;DR - Ghosts has better co-op but you need all 4 DLC's to flesh it out. Matchmaking, when it happens correctly in Ghosts, provides a smoother MP experience with better hit detection."

CallOfDuty,3a4vqa,Decyde,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:38:27 2015 UTC,I don't understand how anyone can recommend Ghosts.  Advanced Warfare adds different gameplay mechanics but it's a fantastic game.
CallOfDuty,3a4vqa,DivineVibrations,3,Wed Jun 17 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Not everybody likes the new gameplay mechanics. IMO, it adds far too much randomness to the gameplay and completely destroys map flow. But in your opinion it probably adds a fresh way of playing the game with new levels of dynamics. There are arguments for both sides."
CallOfDuty,3a4vqa,Tristan552,4,Wed Jun 17 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  but... Ghosts.    Joking aside,  Ghosts online wasn't terrible, I didn't get killed from behind as much as I do in AW that's for sure.   Maybe I'll play Ghosts today, since not even BO3 is going to be classic CoD gameplay."
CallOfDuty,3a4eli,CheeseandRice24,5,Wed Jun 17 03:36:21 2015 UTC,It depends on the quality of the DLC.
CallOfDuty,3a4eli,Antisocial_Taco,4,Wed Jun 17 04:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'd personally take  the ability to play old games on the next gen console over month early DLC, because I rarely buy map packs for games and I still have a pretty big xbox 360 library that I like to play sometimes. I don't think DLC a month early is that good anyway, but I'm a bit patient when it comes to updates/patches and I play a lot of other games and rarely focus on only one.   I don't have either consoles yet though, but I'm leaning towards XB1 because of the backwards compatibility. Plus I don't think too many PS4 exclusives interest me that much. That's another factor you should consider for yourself too though"
CallOfDuty,3a4eli,Maschinengewehr,2,Wed Jun 17 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"Either or. I'm a PS4 owner, and I can say that if BO3 hits it out of the park then I'll be happier with the early DLC and beta. But if BO3 turns out to be meh then I would rather have backwards compatibility."
CallOfDuty,3a4eli,WarEagle33x,2,Wed Jun 17 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"Normally my answer would be ""get a PC,"" but for Call of Duty, it's a console juggernaut. I still play it on PC though. :p  Anyhow, on the topic at hand, get what system you like most or what your friends have and roll with it. Objectively speaking, old games+DLC is a way better deal than early DLC releases. However, it still boils down to personal preference, or both if you can afford it."
CallOfDuty,3a4eli,Beowulf891,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:49:55 2015 UTC,But backwards compatibility doesn't matter if you have that console. Ps4 for me.

However I quit playing BO2 and AW because of their trash connections which weighs more than anything. So I guess it doesn't really matter. I still play my 360 for my CoD fix. FWIW, I own most CoD and DLC on both platforms historically. Now I have a PS4 so be nice I don't have to get a X1 now."

I still think Halo is a great game series, other than that - the PS4 has the better third party and first party games, along with early DLC now for call of duty, Destiny and FF7 early.  It's really a no brainer. I'd get a Xbox one if there was a massive price drop. But no way I'm buying one to only play 1 game that interests me.

CallOfDuty,3a4ql8,mooseknucklemaster,2,Wed Jun 17 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Ghosts has such a negative brand association now I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a new MW title or some new version of a previous MW title. Ghosts 2 isn't a name that's gonna sell units.   Modern Warfare as a brand still has positive selling power, particularly if we see a nostalgia trip with a remake/port although I imagine a direct sequel would probably also perform quite well."

CallOfDuty,3a5w7x,mifflinity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:59:52 2015 UTC,Maybe for those who don't have a console will be influenced but I doubt someone is willing to spend $520ish for a month early DLC.

CallOfDuty,39zny0,Ooobles,-1,Tue Jun 16 13:21:43 2015 UTC,Dude MW2 is like the most colorful cod to date
CallOfDuty,39zny0,iwishiwasbased,3,Fri Jun 19 01:44:11 2015 UTC,It's color scheme is that greeny filter. And MW3 was a grey-ish filter. MW1 was the same greeny filter.

CallOfDuty,39zny0,iwishiwasbased,3,Fri Jun 19 02:52:21 2015 UTC,BO2 had significantly more vivid color than any other cod in recent memory.  holy shit I've never been involved in a discussion that meant less than this one. i'm out

CallOfDuty,39zny0,SpiLLiX,19,Tue Jun 16 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"I'm with you too.  I loved how COD4 and MW2 and MW3, and BO2 played, fast on the ground action, not having to worry about someone being able to jump over a building in order to shoot you."
CallOfDuty,39zny0,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:04:49 2015 UTC,COD WAW was the best call of duty for this exact reason.  Since then the developers has added too much random shit.  Even those crazy kill streaks from mw2 kill the game and make it less skill based..

CallOfDuty,39zny0,Ridoon,3,Tue Jun 16 16:08:58 2015 UTC,maybe   That could possibly be the only thing id buy it for.
CallOfDuty,39zny0,SpiLLiX,2,Tue Jun 16 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"I was hoping they'd keep the exo slide, being able to jump then boost forward and dodging left/right, but remove the upwards boost jumping and go back to more traditional, flatter maps. I just don't think the randomness added by too much 'verticality' suits CoD.  That said, great map design could save the game."
CallOfDuty,39zny0,jimii,0,Tue Jun 16 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"idk, map design is good when it has strengths and weaknesses for both sides.   Usually pertaining to holding angles/lanes etc..   Most of that is taken out with the ability to jump and boost over things with ridic. movement. Possible, but extremely hard. And as we've seen no matter how much they want to say it. Treyarch/IW are simply bad at making ""competitive"" games."
CallOfDuty,39zny0,SpiLLiX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should've said ""could save the game, but it won't happen"". I've lost my faith in the CoD franchise.  I was thinking maps that limit your ability to do the high jump and wall running to very specific areas. They'd either need to have tons of low ceiling areas and/or have the jet-boosters deactivate in certain areas of the map so you can't use them.  I think it'd make for an interesting game as opposed to the constant cluster-fuck of everyone flying around 24/7, but I know it won't happen."

CallOfDuty,39zny0,n0xsean,8,Wed Jun 17 16:24:42 2015 UTC,They seem to make this more of a kids game each and every year.
CallOfDuty,39zny0,Ooobles,13,Tue Jun 16 04:40:06 2015 UTC,Its always been a kids game. Arcade shooter. You want realism hop on arma or even bf3/4. Want competitive fps then Cs:go. I will always look at cod as my chill back no skill kill game.
CallOfDuty,39zny0,n0xsean,-13,Tue Jun 16 07:12:26 2015 UTC,Only decent cod to come out had a mod made for it. Every other cod in vanilla state was easy mode point and click no recoil no game sense games. I hold a 3 kd average with over 200k kills in bo2 and bo1 and can confirm after moving to Cs.... There is literally no skill needed to be good at cod.
CallOfDuty,39zny0,Ooobles,7,Tue Jun 16 10:55:26 2015 UTC,"No, no the game requires some skill, as all do. You don't need to give your stats, I trust your opinion.   It's just that it takes time to learn maps, weapons, aiming, etc. Think about all the things that new generation players have to learn after each iteration of CoD comes out. Despite what you may believe, cod DOES require gamesense. The easiest example is playing spawn areas effectively. Since you have so much experience, you should understand this quite well. Good players understand that, when a group of enemies is in one place on the map, and a group of teammates is spread out, your enemies will spawn closer to you than if your teammates were piled together. And that's just a single example.  Just because cod is a more casual shooter than CSGO or BF4 doesn't mean it's inherently worse. It just means it caters to a different audience, and is good at what it does."
CallOfDuty,39zny0,n0xsean,0,Tue Jun 16 11:31:50 2015 UTC,It will always be a casual shooter in my mind. The way they try to sell off as a competitive fps is a joke... Even mlg is turning into a joke

Watching actual gameplay from people who have been there have really put my worries to ease (mainly about the speed of the boosts, because I personally hates AW). I have been away from cod for 2 years I can honestly say that I'd like to finally get back into it. Treyarch has always been solid and my one of my favourite CoDs are from them.

CallOfDuty,39zoa5,edyer12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:46:58 2015 UTC,I'm delighted. The way activision works means one version will always suffer and it's abut time the Playstation Community get their time in the sun. It could very easily change depending on the landscape of the consoles but it will be nice to have a game that runs smoothly and priority DLC. Anyone who has played both versions of a COD game since Black Ops 1 can tell you that the xbox version runs smoother with less glitches than it's playstation counterpart.

CallOfDuty,39zoa5,edyer12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"You're being downvoted, but I was wondering this as well as a Xbox One gamer. I am getting it later, but how much later? Honestly money plays a big part in these deals and I can't imagine Sony paying as much as Microsoft could (Sony as in the entire company isn't doing as well as just it's Playstation division). Getting something later means people can watch whether it's good or not and a lot of people won't buy it if they have already seen everything there is to see, Sony now has to pay for the customers that they lost through the exclusivity deal.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was a week."

CallOfDuty,39zoa5,Fazblood779,7,Tue Jun 16 21:43:41 2015 UTC,Why would it be first on the least popular platform for COD? Just asking.
CallOfDuty,39zoa5,dylan96r,2,Thu Jun 18 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Because of the exact reason you mentioned. No one buys it on PC so it shouldn't hurt to bring it out at the same time as whichever console gets priority.  Of course I see why they haven't done this.

CallOfDuty,3a1ore,xShinobiii,8,Tue Jun 16 15:17:37 2015 UTC,Bo2 has a bad rating on Steam because it's call of duty. Every cod has a bad rating.

CallOfDuty,3a1ore,Beowulf891,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:56 2015 UTC,Black Ops 1 was my favorite out of all of the COD games and the online maps and play are awesome.
CallOfDuty,3a1ore,GoHookies,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this holds true for PC, but generally everyone plays the newest cods. BO2 is a good one but at least for consoles, there are a lot of just straight up fucking ridiculously good people who play them, so a lot of lobbies are just rape fests."
CallOfDuty,3a1ore,Beowulf891,2,Tue Jun 16 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"There's people populating everything back to the originals. While CoD, UO and CoD2 have far fewer, they are still played. I can pick up nearly any title, short of Ghosts, and get a match going any time of day. Not a lot of people but enough to get things going."
CallOfDuty,3a1ore,Saizou,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:58 2015 UTC,I hate BO2 for this exact reason. I played one match and said fuck that and went back to MW2.

CallOfDuty,3a1ore,InfectedP0tato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"BO2 is the one. Consistently high playercount, really fun, and the best prestige system yet. It's the first COD I've prestiged on and I'm Prestige 3! You get to keep your weapon levels, camos, and emblem unlocks! Probably the biggest reason I recommend it is it's the most colorful recent COD. After MW3, it was a breath of fresh air. The general look and feel of the game have kept me interested longer than any other."

CallOfDuty,3a03pn,Themursk,3,Tue Jun 16 05:01:40 2015 UTC,"Not going to boot camp windows until windows 10 comes out, so I need something until then.
