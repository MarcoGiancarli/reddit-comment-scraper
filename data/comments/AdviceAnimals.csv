The best was the time the owner had just bought a new car, and left it in the warehouse while he went on a weekend business trip. The office manager and I came in early that weekend and took the car out one morning before anyone else was on the road. We ran a couple of red lights that we knew had red light cameras while extending the finger out the driver and passenger windows. Fast forward a couple of weeks when the boss gets the tickets in the mail. He calls us both into the office, he's bright red, and before he can try to convince us he's mad he busts out laughing and takes a good 2 or 3 minutes before he can speak. At the time it was just a small fine per offense, no points or anything, so he ended up just paying the fines. I believe he framed the ticket with our pictures."

AdviceAnimals,3e27wo,Chevex,6,Tue Jul 21 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"I was on my way home from work a couple years back, rush hour, bumper to bumper, high speeds of maybe 30mph.  The SUV in front of me slows down multiple times beyond what traffic calls for (distracted driving?). I flip my hand (no, not flipped off) in a shooing motion, not expecting them to see it but to relieve some frustration as in ""go, go go!"".  We were approaching a green but she slows down to the point we catch the red light. I shake my head, mutter wtf and forget about it. I was just in a really good mood that day!  The light turns green and she takes off slowly, flips me off in her mirror. I laughed, wondering what the hell her problem is, and then I waved and smiled. She flips me off again, ferociously.  Now I realize she's a nut so I wave and smile again. This goes on for about 2 miles with a good dose of attempted break checking going on.  She's in the lane I need to be in so I stay there, she stays there ... lots of waving, smiling and flipping being exchanged.  Finally my turn off comes and we end up beside each other for a moment.  I give her another beaming grin and she mouths something (I've never been good at lip reading) that I assume was not as pleasant.   Fast forward a week and we're having a function at work, and who do I see walk by? Angry SUV lady. I  knew the person she was walking with so I  went by later and asked about her personality, etc, and told her why I was inquiring. ""OMG, that was you?! She was soooooo pissed!""  Apparently SUV lady thought I was driving too close. Maybe I was.  I'd say I gave a full car length while we were at stop/go speeds. I'll generously give myself 2 car lengths when we running at about 30mph. I was certainly in no way hugging her ass and my driving was 100% in line with the other 100+ cars on our stretch of road.   So after some thought, I decided to go visit her and clear the air, because I clearly thought she was some bitter maniac and she clearly thinks I'm the worst driver ever.  The conversation was a little... tense. We each shared our perceptions of the situation. We ultimately agreed to disagree that the other's behavior was appropriate.  She didn't win any points with me when she told me she was half a second away from getting out of her SUV at the red light. ""You're lucky I didn't get out at the red light like I planned."" I nodded and politely responded ""Well, we're probably both lucky in that case"" and raised an eyebrow at her. (Subtle yet powerful, I know).  We both still work at the same place. Our roles require very little interaction with each other. I baked cupcake size cheesecakes one Christmas and dropped one off for her. I'm too old to hold such strong dislike for people over something so silly. Then I decided I'll just keep her in the f'ing maniac category in my head though after I used a bathroom stall directly after her and ended up sitting in her piss. I guess she got the last laugh after all!  To this day if I'm walking behind her at work, I have to resist the urge to speed up and walk really really really close behind."

The site charges a $25 fee to remove your information and close your account. The problem is that - in spite of charging for the service - they actually don't remove your information. As made evident by the hack, all of that information that AM shouldn't have because users paid to have it removed is information that they actually still have on record. Oops. So the hackers are threatening to disclose that information not because they're on some moral trip but because if AM doesn't willingly capitulate, they'll face massive class-action lawsuits that'll force them to close anyways.  Sure, people have latched onto the idea of morality and cheaters being betrayed. Everyone loves some schadenfreude from time to time, and enough people can acknowledge the delicious irony of this whole ordeal that it's actually quite comical from the outside looking in. However, the hackers have no regard for the users. The users are pawns - extra leverage against a company profiting on services not being tendered. And it's the unethical treatment of user information that has provoked the attack (at least, that is the claim...)."
AdviceAnimals,3e156j,shifty_coder,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, this may be the motive behind the hack, but the hackers are attempting to expose a crime (fraud) with another crime (hacking).

Chances of the hackers getting caught is reasonably small and that's if they're even US-based. They're looking to damage AM, and they've already succeeded if only by exposing their fraud and claiming to have the information they do. They can quietly slink back into hiding while people abandon the site in droves in a panic or until AM responds (which would be their choice of closing or facing a ton of legal battles that they would undoubtedly lose). They've got AM by the balls, and they don't even have to do anything at this point.  Illegal? Absolutely. Vigilantism? Most definitely. Illogical? No. No matter what you think of this, it was a strategic play if nothing else.  As for the humor of it all, that's purely subjective, I guess, but I think it's hilarious.

AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,LTmilton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, it /could/ be the CSS if the developer is being malicious to get you to click an ad or something.  But of course it's probably JS... and probably shitty jquery at that."
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,FF3,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely could.  But the real ""issue"" (kind of just one of those ""it is what it is"" things in life) is that they have to load the JS at the end, and that js code makes an extra external request to the ad server.  So the page has to be loaded all the way, then they have to ask for something from outside their own servers, and then load the ad based on the response.  It's completely possible to ""fill"" that space in the meantime so that the rest of the content doesn't shift when the ad is served, but most ad companies make it almost trivial to serve their ads, and most websites are happy to have that turnkey solution so they don't really think about doing anything more complex than what's provided.  Who knows though.  Maybe if people start talking about it enough, sites will begin to work something like that into their basic UX stuff.  That's how a lot of clean little features we see today get going."
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,LTmilton,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"its not BS CSS, its called loading... your browser is trying to pull down all the CSS/Javascript to apply it to the DOM.

AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,arexpants,28,Tue Jul 21 06:31:14 2015 UTC,I always thought it is done to generate accidental ad revenue.  All the ads on the popular websites are strategically sized and placed
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,dogfish83,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:04 2015 UTC,It is often done on purpose. There's JS on the page that moves the browser right when you click or tap so that you will (hopefully) click an ad instead. It's not uncommon at all.
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,briansprojects,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:06 2015 UTC,This may be what's happening in some cases but most of the time it is due to images loading in right before you click. If the website isn't built correctly this can cause the page to jump around. Moving things on the page with JavaScript to force the user to click has to be against the advertisers policies.
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,YayDrugz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:36 2015 UTC,force the user to click has to be against the advertisers policies.   Forcing a click would be fraud but shifting a webpage on click when the page itself is surrounded by banners is not. Its similar to a click spawning a JS alert which redirects to another (ad) web page.
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,briansprojects,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"Then you have those ads on mobile for Fame of Flame/War/whatever Kate Upton's endorsing for cash now... that if you click on the little × it opens the app store instead, it's common on sites I wanna watch videos on and the ad is in the way of the Full Screen button on mobile and it won't go away!"
AdviceAnimals,3e0le9,metalflygon08,8,Tue Jul 21 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"well...the usual solution to this was to just set all the widths and heights for each image on the page, that way even if the image hasn't loaded yet it will still occupy the space it needs and there won't be any changes in the layout once it's loaded.   Then responsive web design became a thing, images are supposed to scale according to the screen width...so now you can't really hard code the numbers in anymore without breaking the layout...obviously there are solutions for this but the web in general has gotten a lot more complicated and not everyone spends time on this. It's not a simple thing to do anymore and requires some thought and planning."

For those who post to Facebook and Instagram and Vine and Snapchat, they don't give a fuck because the app that is playing the video fills the screen, so its fine.

It's hard being a parent so don't assume I'm casting blame lightly...but still...Then everyone acts flabbergasted when I tell them they have tons of cavities and might need baby teeth out early.

The waiting room there was exactly like you just described.   About 6 years ago I switched them over to a smaller dental practice that's much more personal and actually cares for the patients.

But seriously, if you fucking spank your kids when they are little, don't spoil them, don't give them trophies for nothing, this kind of shit never ever happens.   By the time the kid thinks this is a good idea, you have already fucked up.   Single father, raised two kids who are now honor roll students with no discipline problems, both now teenagers.  People need to learn the difference between abuse and discipline, and fucking use the discipline."

AdviceAnimals,3dzw5h,BrickMacklin,24,Tue Jul 21 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"Don't let the spanking be the default all the time, it is just one of many tools available to you.  If your kids always know what their punishment will be they start to weigh their choices of ""If I get caught doing this, no dessert for a week.""  If that's all you ever do, they risk it.   So mix it up, sometimes the punishment is toys being taken away, sometimes timeouts, sometimes spanking, as they age obviously no dessert, time outs, and spanking become less effective.    For the most part my kids are good, well behaved teenagers, but they are still teenagers.  So when it is needed the best punishment is no electronics, change your wifi passcode, take away smart phones and laptops.  It is hard being a parent you have to juggle being a disciplinarian, a loving caregiver, and sometimes a trusted friend.  If you don't do enough  of one or too much of another things get fucked up.   I will tell you when I stopped spanking my son, when I realized he would lie to my face even though there was undeniable evidence of his screw up because he didn't want to get spanked.  I had screwed up.  I lost any trust in our relationship, I sat him down explained how he needed to own up to his mistakes and so did I and that if we could start to trust each other again the spanking would stop.  I made him a deal, the only time he would ever get spanked again was if he lied to me, about a month later I had to follow up on that but I reminded him of our conversation and it was the last time I had to spank him.  I believe he was 9 years old at the time, maybe 10.   Being a parent and trying to not raised fucked up kids is hard, I am sure I have screwed up plenty of times, but I can honestly say I am very proud of my 16 year  old son, and my 13 year old daughter.  All their life when they go away with family for weekends or trips, have sleepovers at friends houses, stuff like that I always get told how well behaved they are.  The only time that didn't happen was once with my daughter, and she just had a bad day everyone has a few of those.  Sometimes you have to understand it is OK if your kids hate you for a day or so as a result of being punished, no one likes to be punished.  Some parents just want to always be their kids friends and never ever want to see them hurt or cry.  Thats not the job of a parent, sometimes you have to be hated (hopefully briefly), sometimes you have to be the reason they cry or get hurt, it should break your heart when it happens because you love them, but man those few times are worth all the other times when you have well behaved non spoiled rotten kids."

AdviceAnimals,3dzw5h,VolofTN,7,Tue Jul 21 05:55:44 2015 UTC,"As a kid raised in a household like this, don't be surprised when your kids resent you later. I was a model student all throughout high school, because of my parents discipline. But as soon as I was an adult, I realized that our relationship was one of dominance, that my parents exercised their authority to make my life what they wanted from it.  It certainly gets results. But there is a cost. Every kid is different, but if you don't respect your child's dreams and make every rule hard and fast, sometimes things won't go as you plan."
AdviceAnimals,3dzw5h,Mirrorminx,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:35 2015 UTC,"A parent's role is to help their kids transition into healthy, fully functioning adults. Many parents seem to have difficulty figuring this out."
AdviceAnimals,3dzw5h,EmeraldKnight92,3,Tue Jul 21 06:49:23 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to be consistent and to follow through on things.  If you say ""if you do X, you will get spanked"" and then they do it, they'd better be spanked.  If you threaten but don't follow through, they'll learn that you won't follow through and will push you.  And if you follow through half the time but don't the rest, you're sending mixed signals which just makes things worse.    But if your kids know you will always follow through, they'll take you seriously the first time.  I know there were a few times where my mom left the shopping cart in the middle of the grocery store to take me out to the car to spank me because she said she would.  Another time she told my brother and I that the next time we wandered away in the water park, we were going straight home.  She didn't even bother packing lunch the next time we went, because she knew someone would wander away before it got to be lunch time.  By the time my siblings and I grew up, we knew the consequences of misbehaving and we knew how to behave well.    The other important thing is to not punish while angry.  Timely punishment is important, but punishing while angry is the biggest thing that causes resentment.  Punishing a child needs to be a necessary thing that has to get done, rather than an anger release.  There were a couple of times where my dad drove home from work in the middle of the day to punish us because my mom was too annoyed to punish without being angry, and those were the times we really knew we screwed up.  But it still never felt like they were angry at us while punishing us, which is important.  That's not to say we weren't pissed at them over it at the time, but looking back on it there's no resentment."

Grounding for the day required her to receive no treats from her parents and any gifts she received from strangers had to given to her parents' safekeeping.   If she kept misbehaving beyond that point, she was grounded for the week. At this point you could see the monumental reserves a young child has when they realize that things will just get worse.

AdviceAnimals,3e06we,Dilsnoofus,135,Tue Jul 21 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"The central point here isn't that people use the website to cheat.  It's that the website itself trapped the people who, for whatever reason--curiosity, a bad patch in their marriage, sheer and stupendous assholishness--gave the site a try and were greeted with an option when they changed their mind:  ""Pay us $19.99 and we'll wipe your info or it will live on forever!""     And they took the money and didn't wipe the info. Look, be as self righteous as you want.  Cheaters deserve everything they get.  But what if you didn't cheat?  What if you changed your mind?  Aren't we allowed that chance in this world?  To fuck up in the least impactful way possible?  And then, to believe the blackmail pledge of that site to cover your fuck up, and pay good money for it while they had no intention of following through?     The Ashley Madison people are huge fucking bastards for that.  But to threaten to drag everyone down with them?  These ""hacktivists"" are pure shite.     Think of every mistake you've made.  Now, narrow it down to ANY mistake you've ever made.  Do you really want that in the hands of a pile of internet trolls who want to make a point about something completely different--but could give less than a squirt of piss about who gets hurt?"

I also never condoned the hacking or releasing of private information.  But I don't have sympathy for someone cheating on their unknowing SO and exposing them to an increased risk of STDs, potential child support expenses, etc.  while there are some extreme cases where the cheater might be sympathetic (i.e. An abusive spouse they are protecting the kids from), those tend to be very rare exceptions and generally that are not meeting their white knight through AM.  Should they get exposed and their SOs find out that they are cheating and putting them at risk, I'll be very happy about the outcome even if I still condemn the means.  So no, the end doesn't justify the means.  But I'm not shedding any tears for a mostly terrible group of human beings."
AdviceAnimals,3e06we,Sptsjunkie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:55 2015 UTC,Historically we are monogamous animals. We've been the same as we are now; serial monogamous animals.

AdviceAnimals,3e06we,ServeChilled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:41 2015 UTC,"Depends when you mean. Prior to the agricultural revolution the average amount of wives was roughly 1.5. Most were monogamous, with some light polygamy, (2-3 wives). Afterwards there was an explosion in wives due to the ability to horde resources and wealth. I don't remember the exact number, but the emperor of the Incas had so many concubines that the average male had a very reduced chance of having a wife.  Either way. It's an argument from nature, which is a fallacy. What is ""natural"" isn't always moral."

I'd never heard of Ashley Madison until recently, but when I checked it out after hearing about the ""Hack"" I noticed that they do have an option for married people, but also for people who are single. So not everyone using this site that is being violated has cheated on a partner.  At the end of the day, they had their personal and private data exposed. Something we are up in arms about on a daily basis. It doesn't matter if they are cheating on their wives, or up/down voting memes on a website.

AdviceAnimals,3e06we,Sinister_Crayon,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"So here goes... my buried comment for the day :)    I have an account on AM... I might even remember the password. But what does it matter to me? Not a peep and let me tell you why;    In 2007/2008 my marriage had failed and I had moved out. As a man who spent a lot of time working (and even moreso after I was single because I had nowhere else to be) I ended up signing up on a bunch of different sites including AM. I wasn't looking for ""forever"" or ""the one""... I was looking for companionship and yes... sex. I have to admit also that in my mindset at the time I really wasn't too fussy if the person I had sex with was already married. Yeah, that was morally pretty dubious of me... but understand at that point I was angry at the entire world and angry at myself. I was ready to do all kinds of shitty things to myself in order to find some semblance of happiness because all the work I'd put into my marriage over the preceding 4 years or so since my wife's first infidelity was for nothing.    So I signed up on AM, among other sites. I can honestly say that in the end I ended up with precisely one ""date"" off AM with a woman who definitely had decided that AM was a dating site so she could justify to herself getting out of her own shitty marriage. She was looking for an out... yes I slept with her... but I noped out of it as soon as I figured out what she was doing. I got more dates (and ironically more sex) after I had calmed down a bit and started actively looking for a longer term relationship rather than a hookup.    What this means is that yeah, my personal information will be among the released stuff I'm sure. But I really don't care about my significant other finding out. I'm not the same person I was 7 years ago and my life has changed a lot. I have a girlfriend/partner who honestly might find it amusing that I had an AM account. She won't judge me for it because that was during a different time in my life before we met.    I am concerned about the information that might be made available... social security number would be a pain in the ass (but hopefully they'd reach out with credit protection services like in the cases of other breaches... but having said that I already have that due to a previous breach). But on the flip side I'm not going to lose sleep over it. Data breaches are so common these days you have to presume every bit of data that you enter on a website or even a paper form will at some point find its way onto the Internet... and presume it'll be public. I've already been a victim of a data breach, and honestly can't remember what other info AM got from me that I might be worried about. Probably none.    My point; not everyone signed up on AM just to cheat on their spouse. Yeah, maybe my thought process was significantly flawed as well in that I didn't care if the person I was with was married. My only rationalization is truly depression and an element of self-harm that was completely intentional. People do weird things when they feel they have nothing left to lose.    For the record, as far as hookups at the time I had much better luck on POF than AM... and that was free."

AdviceAnimals,3dzo6t,Phallendoor,28,Tue Jul 21 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently the company refuses to delete your personal information once you've made an account. Unless you paid for a special service to clean up after yourself. They are essentially holding your person information for ransom. And there's been rumors that none of your personal information is actually deleted if you pay up.  Sure, someone could just claim this is the case, and it sounds like some had. (Edit: It also seems this was the case.) But no company is going to say, ""You've got no evidence, but what can I say? You got me! We've been praying on our users' fears by holding their personal data hostage.""  Also, from a completely hate-the-company point of view, this stands to do more damage. By leaking usernames, emails, and person info of customers who think they are being anonymous, you break people's trust in the company, which is all but required for a site designed around having affairs."
AdviceAnimals,3dzo6t,DannyDaemonic,13,Tue Jul 21 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"Which brings into question the ethics of this. I understand the seemingly robin hood-esque idea presented here, and obviously that company needs to delete the records and reimburse anyone who paid for that service. AM should be held responsible for it, and I don't think there is much room for argument there. I'm asking how they can possibly justify these actions they are threatening to get the results they want. There is a very good quote from Dr Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park about focusing so hard on whether or not you can do something that you didn't stop to think if you should.  They are willing to risk real damage to 37 million people (maybe more depending on how many families are affected) to get at one company. And not just people who partake in undisclosed affairs, but people who are in open marriages or relationships, DA/DT relationships, etc. Understand that these relationships are very complex and still fairly taboo in common societal views, and having that information exposed can, and dare I say will, cause harm to them. Source: best friend is in open marriage.  Throwing 37 million people under the bus for your righteous crusade makes you no better than the party you are crusading against.  Also, considering privacy is such a hot topic in today's world, I find it funny that people claim to want it when they are willing to expose someone else's private matters and subject them to judgements, harassment, ridicule, and professional, familial, or legal ramifications."

AdviceAnimals,3dzo6t,Shaquarington_Bithus,47,Tue Jul 21 01:15:44 2015 UTC,"I heard him on the radio once giving a similar interview.. and while I initially thought ""you're a horrible person"", by the time it was done I did see his point.  Because here's the thing: people who want to cheat are going to cheat. End of story. But a lot of the time they're doing it with people who believe they're single, or who they're stringing along with the promise of leaving their current partner for them etc.  So if people are going to cheat then it's best they do so while being completely upfront about it with the other person. Both parties know exactly what they're getting in to and there's some value in that.  And as much as reddit loves to vilify cheaters, every time an askreddit thread pops up saying ""cheaters, why do you do it?"" there are tons of people sharing their stories of being trapped in horrible relationships they can't get out of, partners threatening (and then attempting) suicide, being unable to leave because it would leave them broke and homeless so they're trapped in emotionally abusive relationships or simply not willing to give up their entire lives by ending a relationship. Posts that are responded to with lots of upvotes, support and understanding.  One guy in the last one got in a ""if you leave I'll kill myself"" relationship, left... and she did it. Even left a note saying how now he'd ""never forget her"". Now he's currently in another one of those relationships and is terrified to leave.. so he cheats.  So yeah. It's simply not as black and white as a lot of people believe. And while I personally have never cheated and hope never to do so... releasing all the information is going to cause a lot of harm.. and not necessarily to just those 'who deserve it'."

These kinds of things were an interesting form of people watching for me. To see how people advertise themselves when no one's looking or when they're hopeful for some kind of connection.   What entertained me the most with AM, were the amount of women that came across that just didn't fit the AM profile. These were women that were not looking for an affair, sugar daddy, or anything like that. They were treating AM like OKCupid, Match, or something similar and looking for a monogamous relationship.   They'd have lines saying they don't want to be used or part of some infidelity.  Many times I wanted to reach out and ask, ""Why are you on a site that's completely based on having an affair, looking for a guy to grow old with?""   Of course, it could have all been an act or some part of their fantasy. They want to come off as the woman that's innocent and incorruptible and enjoy the game in having the guy ""convince"" them to go against the morals they've put forth.

AdviceAnimals,3dzo6t,ukiyoe,77,Tue Jul 21 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"Food for thought.   According to nationally representative survey data, in the United States 20 to 40 percent of heterosexual married men and 25 percent of heterosexual married women will have at least one extramarital affair during their lifetime, and 2 to 4 percent of all married people are willing to tell survey researchers that they’ve had an affair in the past year.    In nonmarried but “committed” couples there is a 70 percent incidence of cheating. In addition, 60 percent of men and 53 percent of women confess that they’ve engaged in “mate poaching”  (trying to seduce a person out of a committed relationship).   However...   According to a recent survey of attitudes about extramarital affairs in forty different nations, 84 percent of people in the United States said infidelity was “morally unacceptable.” Another poll, from Gallup, found that infidelity is more universally disapproved of than polygamy, animal cloning, and suicide.   Meanwhile...   In France most people have come to expect that their political leaders will have affairs, at minimum, and often an entire second family too. When François Mitterrand was president, his mistress Anne Pingeot, and their daughter, Mazarine Pingeot, would often visit him at the Élysée Palace, despite the fact that he had a wife and children. At Mitterrand’s funeral in 1996, his second family sat alongside his first family.   Source: Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari"

It was when I was stuck in an abusive relationship and in an especially awful night of being emotionally destroyed a female friend made me give in.  That night helped me restore my self esteem and love of myself which gave me the strength to get out of the relationship.  I later found out I had been cheated on during the entire relationship, but my decision was never revenge. It was a selfish decision that actually brought light back into my life.  I am now engaged to a wonderful woman who told me she also cheated once in a very similar situation. We are very in love and I have never cheated after that night.

AdviceAnimals,3dzo6t,InternetTAB,27,Tue Jul 21 06:43:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll do it. I'll be the one who defends Ashley Madison (""AM""). I know several people who do it and they all have different reasons.  First and foremost, a lot of couples are in open marriages where each person is free to have sexual relationships with other people. AM is a fantastic place to meet other people who are in open marriages who are also looking to branch out sexually. It's a good way of targeting your search so that you don't wind up sleeping with someone who is looking to turn a little fling into a serious, monogamous, relationship. You're far less likely to have a person you meet on AM enraged because you won't leave your spouse and elope with them.  Second, marriages can be complicated, especially when there are kids and houses involved. If you're one of those people sitting there saying, ""I never think about any woman other than my wife and when I'm not thinking about my wife, I'm thinking about my kids or my lawn"" then my hat's off to you. Some people need more than that. They love their significant other and they love their children and the life that they have built together, but if that is all they experience, it begins to eat at them. Day by day, poison and resentment build in their mind as that beautiful house in the suburbs becomes an emasculating prison. I've seen bitter, resentful, men turn into the kindest, happiest, most loving and supportive fathers and husbands all because they started getting a little extra on the side. Is that a perfect relationship? Well, it's not how I would do it. But the family is loved and cared for. And more importantly, it's not my relationship so I'm not going to criticize and pass judgment.  If all of the subscriber information is leaked to the public, it would stand for the proposition that individuals are not entitled to privacy in cases where any other person believes that the private behavior is not moral. In a free society, that absolutely cannot be the standard. Why should the general public (which includes friends, family, employers, etc.) have access to that which takes place in the private confines of the lives of individuals? Even if you don't feel sorry for the ""cheaters"", what about the people in open marriages whose bosses are now free to fire them because open marriages offend their religious convictions?  Let's think about this. We can't laud Snowden as a hero while we scoff at the AM subscribers and say, ""They had it coming."" Privacy is privacy."

Several were in bad relationships. When their data comes out, some of them could be in serious physical trouble. That's not as fun to think about as some jerk guy cheating on his wife gettin' his comeuppances. These are families about to be torn apart and with no idea what they really did or didn't do. Dozens of women talked to me but, they didn't go through with a meeting. They just wanted the attention. Doesn't matter though, they'll be lumped in with the rest. Everyone has a story, everyone has moments of weakness. These hackers think they're doing something great and people are soooo self righteous that they applaud them.

So my older brother (25) met a girl through some mutual friends (24) last August. In October she moved 80km out of her apartment and moved into his house. In November he gave her a promise ring because she wanted a him to show ""commitment"" (who the fuck gives promise rings at 25??), fast forward to Christmas time when they announce they are getting married on September this year. She doesn't have an engagement ring yet but they already have the date, venues, and list of people invited all made up. Two weeks later they get a dog. In February they finally get a ring, it's her dream Tiffany's $10,000.00 ring, I'd like to point out that my brother had to finance this as they were short on cash but she HAD to have her dream ring. Fast forward to June (the night before my other brothers wedding) where we are all staying at his house, just the guys, and his Vivint security cam starts moving (his fiance is looking around the room spying on us), he flips out and disconnects the camera. And here we are today... he's getting married in just over a month, almost 1 year after meeting her."
AdviceAnimals,3e02il,wubbbalubbadubdub,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"Moving in after 1 month Promise ring at a wierd age ""Commitment"" 2 months in Engagement after 4 months Pet after 4 months Irrational demands of ring well outside of budget Spying Brother not confronting spying, just nullifying the tool   8 flags by my count  From this point I expect she will get pregnant soon after the marriage in an ""accident"" 2 or 3 years down the line with a kid he'll probably come to the realization that he hates what has happened.  If I was you I'd try to spend as much time with your bro as possible away from his soon to be wife and just be as supportive as humanly possible so that when he comes to this realization on his own he knows you'll be there for him.  Also, if you have the ability, start saving as much as you can, that kind of irrational need for material possessions will likely result in him being heavily indebted (just don't bail him out before any sort of break up occurs)  Don't directly put yourself at odds with her and make him choose a side, don't let him know your opinions about her, don't make a point to let others know what you are doing. The disconnecting of the camera kind of shows he's aware something is wrong, but he needs to come to the realization that he's made a poor choice on his own, if you try to convince him he will just argue and become more ingrained and stuck in his situation."

(I am neither qualified nor have enough information to diagnose...so take that with a grain of salt.) In any case make sure you don't give in a bit - like agreeing to talk to her about why you needed to break up - to try and make her feel better. She will see it as the first step to getting back together. Clean break. And maybe the restraining order.

One year, I was out with my gf on my birthday, and I saw all of them and then some(new friends I had met after high school), and I got livid as fuck. Here I am thinking that ""would you look at that, all these mofos who never bothered to call me up and hang out, are out here together grabbing dinner and didn't even invite me!"". One of them starts coming my direction as if it was coincidence that we had run into each other, he asks for a hug, and I give him the stiff arm and said ""fuck you guys, all here and no one called me"".

AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,bustedcougar,26,Tue Jul 21 03:39:07 2015 UTC,No one should ever be forced into marriage.. but I have to kind of wonder how she got your entire family and friends to perform an intervention about it. She must have had some pretty convincing reasoning or was just a sociopath. Were you living with the girl for x amount of years with a child on the way or something?
AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,braunheiser,21,Tue Jul 21 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Been together on and off for 7 years (according to her, I don't quite remember).  All my friends are married with kids.  I am last man standing.  I don't see the point in marriage to be honest.  I am not mad, she had every right to feel the way she feels based on social norm.  Not only that, but my dad is siding with her: ""I want to hold my grandson before I die!"" So yeah, no pressure here."
AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,ismellurpoo,28,Tue Jul 21 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"I guess the questions are ""do you love her? Do you see yourself spending your life with her?"". Because if the answer is yes to both, and youve both been together long enough to know the answer is yes for each other (which after 7 years id hope so), even if you dont 'see the point' in marriage, i think her feelings have to be considered. You say you dont see the point, but do you have a major reason to object to it? If not, even if you dont see the point, then maybe the point is just doing something for someone else you care for, even if its something youre not crazy enthused about. At the same time this is also a great time to reexamine those first 2 questions... if the answer is no to either then yes, you probably should let her go, because marriage seems like something she wants to have in her life and after 7 years it probably should either happen or she should have a chance to move on.   Especially if things like kids are something she wants in the future (she's got a clock on that, and eventually she's going to feel like she needs to lock this down -as most want to be married before kids- or move on while she has time)"
AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,fco83,10,Tue Jul 21 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"I understand, that is why I see dark clouds ahead.  I am doing this just for her.  Love?  Who knows.  After 7 years, the definition of ""love"" itself has changed.  I don't even know what love is anymore.  I kept telling her that our relationship has lasted longer than most marriages, she was not amused.  It's a tough call for sure."
AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,ismellurpoo,11,Tue Jul 21 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well certainly the feeling of love and what it is changes as a relationship goes on. I think thats only natural as you become more in tune with each other and the initial rush wears off.   And i can see why she wasnt amused. That probably only added more fire to it. If marriage is important to her, the fact that its been that long says she's invested a ton of time in this without reaching that goal.  Are you happy with her? Do you want her in your life the rest of your life?  And seeing another comment of yours, marriage is more than just about property and taxes. Its a lifetime commitment to one another. She wants that. Id bet she doesnt give a damn about the taxes."
AdviceAnimals,3dzkg1,fco83,4,Tue Jul 21 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"A piece of paper is not commitment.  That is my point.  A piece of paper is just a piece of paper.  A ring is a rock on a piece of metal, not a promise.  What i do every single day should tell her how I feel."

It's free to sign up and use, but almost anything you want to actually do on the site costs their credits, which you purchase with money. Want to read a message someone has sent you? Costs credits.   There was a thread a while back where someone posted that every time they'd start to get low on credits, suddenly their inbox would fill up with messages from girls with very attractive pictures. He'd buy more credits, read the messages and respond, and never get another reply back. Low on credits again? Suddenly the inbox starts filling up again.  The site basically had shell accounts they'd use to get get people to want to spend more money. Apparently in their TOS they have a disclaimer for exactly that practice saying they had 'entertainers' on the site as well, and those kinds of messages were for 'entertainment only'."

A stupid premise nonetheless but I think if true it's clearly not anything close to what Set Meyers is talking about and even if it's false the fact that explanation exists is enough to show that naming something 'No apologizes' isn't necessarily a tact admission of mistakes.

AdviceAnimals,3dywtd,rj20876,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"Lots of other people here have already told you how to fix your problem.  I had a chance to teach someone in real life about how to tie their shoes to keep them from coming untied.  A friend was complaining about how he had to double-knot his running shoes so they wouldn't come untied.  I told him the fix and he didn't believe me.  The next time I saw him he told me that he single knotted his shoes with one the normal way and with one using the supposed fix.  He said shortly into his run he looked down and his ""normal"" tie was undone and the fixed one was still tied.  He told me that at that moment in his mind he said, ""Fuck you Tacknosaddle!""  I take it as a win."

So, yes, I update it regularly: whenever I become friends with someone. I also don't friend every person I ever meet or accept all friend requests, so that limits the ""work.""  I honestly just leave it on the default (all friends) most of the time unless I am sharing something that is specific to a group of friends or if I know it will offend a certain group.  Do I think everyone does it? Absolutely not, but that wasn't the point of my post.

AdviceAnimals,3dy96l,immauser,72,Mon Jul 20 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"My dad was remodeling his bathroom and it's exactly 4x12'. So when he he went to replace the ceiling drywall he decided to use one sheet of drywall and decided to put it up by himself. Drywall it pretty heavy and unwieldy and he was having trouble. Mom comes into the bathroom, under the drywall while he's holding it, and she's asks if she can do anything to help. He says ""you need to move in case i drop this."" She continues to stand there asking how to help and finally, as the weight of the drywall begins to get the better of him he yells ""get the fuck out of the bathroom now!"" She kinda deserved that, but was not terribly happy with him after that one. I avoid all issues and just tell my husband to leave me alone unless I explicitly ask for help."

We live in a state where everyone has cinder block walls and only way to get it in the yard was over the backwall.  I moved my truck and got it on the wall. Climbed over and put myself under the center of the table and lifted it off the wall and over my head.  About 125 lbs lifted awkwardly over my head as I'm walking it over to the patio 15 feet away. My idea was I'd crouch down and crawl out underneath  it once I got there.  My wife wanted to help, grabbed the back leg and pushes straight up. Keep in mind I'm the fulcrum in the center of the table. I don't realize what the fuck is going on and I'm falling towards the patio as running is the only way to keep the table from flying out of my hands and exploding into pieces in front of me.   Finally, after 10 feet she says ,""I cant keep up"" and I realize wtf is going on and I tell her to stop. I get it on the patio after rebalancing the table.

It's that her experience is with devices where the temperature is adjustable (in fact, many ovens have a single temperature and a thermostat). For her stove, she possibly knows she has a knob that adjusts the gas flow and the temperature, so why wouldn't the house heat work the same way? It's not illogical, it's just the wrong impression. Correct the impression and problem solved. Edit: Electric blankets are the same way, temperature adjustable, but also sometimes with a thermostat, making things extra confusing.

AdviceAnimals,3dy96l,PC_Mustard_Race83,14,Tue Jul 21 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"Back when my wife and I were just dating, we had done one of those crazy photo mosaic puzzles and decided it had been too much work to simply take it all apart.  We were going to glue it together and frame it.  We bought some puzzle glue and let it set overnight, then went out the following day for a frame.  Our puzzle was 16x20, so we were looking for a 16x20 frame.  We go to Michael's and she is looking over the frames.  She holds one up to me and says in a frustrated tone, ""All they have is 20x16.""  I just stare at her for a few seconds.  Then I take the frame from her, rotate it 90 degrees, and hand it back to her without saying a word.  ""Ohhhhhhh.""  We still joke about it now some 10 years later.  More recently, we went to see Jurassic World.  The following day I had been looking up Easter Eggs from the movie online, and saw where the T-Rex was the same one from the original movie.  I went home at lunch and related this little factoid to my wife.  She says, ""Oh, like they used the same model?""  ""No, it's THE same dinosaur that was in the first movie.""  ""Right, like they reused the same assets from the original film.""  ""NO.  It's THE EXACT SAME DINOSAUR as the one who ate the lawyer off the toilet.""  ""Oh, I get it...""  I knew she still didn't get what I was saying, and called her on it.  She says, ""OK, so how was the T-rex made?""  ""They fertilized an egg in a lab.""  ""No, not like in the movie, like the people who MADE the movie.  How did they make it?  Like with computers?  And with a robotic head, right?""  ""Correct.""  ""So that same head was used in the new movie?""  ""Are you fucking with me?""  This went on for a couple more minutes until I finally gave up.  I didn't marry her for her smarts though.

While idling, the phone uses 800 MB of RAM due to all the Sprint services (half are probably spyware) running in the background. I ended up rooting the phone and uninstalling most of the apps, except that Sprint included a service that detects when something is uninstalled, and forcefully reinstalls all the apps without your permission. I didn't feel like dealing with that BS so I just flashed a new ROM. Now it uses 300MB of RAM at idle, and the battery life basically doubled.  Sprint, never again."

AdviceAnimals,3dy1cy,cfiggis,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"I rooted it over a year ago, so I can't really remember what problems I came across, but the hardest part of rooting is installing the custom recovery software (I use TWRP) which allows you to later easily manage partitions and install any ROM you want. I think I just followed this tutorial step by step. But yeah, once you have TWRP installed, everything else is super easy. It's only a one time thing, so you don't need to re-root every time you want to install a new OS. You just download the ROM, copy it into the root folder on your phone, boot into TWRP, click on Install, and that's pretty much it I think. You can also go into ""Advanced"" and ""ADB Sideload"" if you ever accidentally brick your phone. This allows you to force-flash a new ROM from the command line on your PC. It has helped me many times."

Since Android runs Linux ""root"" is the highest level authority in the operating system, akin to the Local Administrator or Domain Administrator in Windows. When you have root-level access to your Android phone you can do anything you want with it, including uninstalling all the bloatware crap apps that phone manufacturers and companies put on such as Sprint's Nascar app, the many many bloat apps Samsung phones have, T-Mobiles Service app and Verizon's stupid little messenger and stuff."

Another user mentioned the XDA forums, they're a great resource. I suggest doing some reading into the root process though so that you know a bit more about it other than ""I ran this software and now I'm root"" simply because it's good information to know. Just read some quick summaries about what root actually means and what ROMs are and you should be good.  You may also want to look into replacing your kernel and/or ROM. This is a bit more advanced though and can break your phone so be careful, although typically it can be fixed if that happens.

You'll notice that computers don't feel any faster than they used to be- you can do more stuff with them but booting still takes time, waiting for stuff to load still happens....  Where they CAN get improvements is by, for example, adding memory registers for something a programmer might want to make your processor do a lot. So for an oversimplified example, if they take a graphics processor that has one shader, then they add 83 more shaders, and you've got a program that does a lot of shading, BOOM!!!! 84x speed improvement*!!!!  * = for shading operations only.

AdviceAnimals,3dy1dr,devilsephiroth,6,Mon Jul 20 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"I concur to some degree. While on one hand Apple's performance (hardware) is disappointing, (IMHO) their reliability and operating system have both been consistently above par. Making it worth the hype/overpricing. At least until recently."
AdviceAnimals,3dy1dr,stevetehpirate,7,Mon Jul 20 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"Reliability I think is debatable. Compared to low end Android phones yes it's way better. Compared to flagship phones where the price point is most computable I'd say it's close to an even heat. Some past droid phones have had some hiccups but so have some past iPhones. I think most notably the fact that I knew maybe 2 people who didn't break their screens on the 4 at least once.   Software though. Apple definitely started out way ahead of the pack, but Android passed them a few years back and Apple doesn't seem to care. Adding features in New OS's that Android has had for years and treating it like it's new and revolutionary seems to be every Apple keynote now."

Apart from that ongoing stream of bullshit, I think the system for backups, appdata, and essential mobile functions (GPS, messaging, phone calls, and web browsing) is more reliable on apple devices. Because Android relies so heavily on 3rd party software, it loses some of that stability (although it gains serious points in functionality).  As for the hardware, I've never cracked a screen. Personally, I think the same people are going to crack screens no matter what phone they're using. I'm talking primarily about battery cycling/performance and storage."

AdviceAnimals,3dy1dr,ben7337,10,Mon Jul 20 20:25:57 2015 UTC,I think that making phones very thin with short battery life moves the choice onto the customer. There are lots of aftermarket devices/cases that will extend your battery life at the cost of weight. If you just make the phone heavy with batteries you remove the choice of the person that is willing to settle for less battery for the size/weight savings.

The answer is because you are a much smarter customer than most. I've been pushing for clients to stop begging for thinner products for years. I've referenced zoolander. I've drawn data based graphs. I've used logic and wisdom and ergonomic prototypes and anecdotes all to justify the fact that our phones are now TOO thin. It's all adds up to the resounding truth that our phones are now too thin.   But there's one research area that routinely undermines that conclusion: consumer research. (And I should say specifically ""bad"" consumer research) when talking to consumers who are not as verbose and attuned to the standards with which to measure the effectiveness of a device design they will default to critiquing the most familiar features of the design. What is the most familiar feature of tech device design? Thinness. It will be mentioned before everything else.   And even if a company knows better. They know thinness doesn't matter that much. Really. They know the data is biased. They know the phones are too thick. The investment of smart phones is waaaaaay to large to put millions and millions of dollars into development only to release... the thickest phone on the market. Even if you had the most battery life it would need to be about a solid WEEK of battery life to justify being that thick. And that's not an easy thing to do.  It's not just Ive. It's not just Apple.

AdviceAnimals,3dy7zl,Mikey129,12,Mon Jul 20 21:32:50 2015 UTC,"Tech guy who works in online video delivery here.  Chances are you use an Android phone?  This happens because the video itself does not have a delivery method available to Android, but the ad video delivery of course does.  Android delivery, without native support for the apple standard HLS delivery, is spotty at best.  Most newer Androids say they play HLS fine, but the majority of them do not.  This is unfortunately because of so many variations of Android and or the phone you are using, and no real standardization among any of them.  Even with stock android that you will find on Google phones, it doesn't always work.  There is however a delivery method used by many for Android called Progressive Media Download (PMD) that will allow Android to download and stream the video.  This delivery option comes at a cost though... no fast forward / scrubbing, and on the technical level is much more prone to security risks.  Basically PMD means that your phone and or device you are streaming with is downloading the whole file, and playing the video file as it is downloading.  With the Apple standard HLS, the video is sent to you in ""chunks"" normally 10s each that are put together by your device to allow you to ""stream"" the video rather than download it to your phone.  Android does not handle these ""chunks"" very well and just ends up with a broken video.  EDIT:  If you ever come across a video online that you cannot fast forward, changes are that is progressive download and will work fine on your Android."
AdviceAnimals,3dy7zl,hogie48,4,Mon Jul 20 20:07:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for that explanation. I have been an Android fan from day one for the option of third party apps and customizability.

AdviceAnimals,3dy7zl,deeayepee,4,Mon Jul 20 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"I am an Android user myself, and honestly would never go back to an iPhone.  There are options like I mentioned, but unfortunately they are all put on the content provider.  At my work we have Android delivery (PMD) enabled on some of our brands, but other brands do not because of legal reasons.  The security risk I mention is best described like this:  HLS Delivery: You stream your video from somewebsite.com/video, but the video files them self are actually stored on a company like Akamai or Amazon.  The video is streamed from them, but it looks like its coming from the website you wanted, or it may show Akamai/Amazon URL but with some crazy URL that doesn't make sense nor can you actually navigate to in a browser.  PMD: You stream your video from somewebsite.com/video, but when you debug the website you can see that the video file is actually coming from akamai.com/customer/folder/blah/blah/blah/video.mp4.  Because of this url specifically, a tech person can see that link and then go and actually download the video directly from the source right to their computer.  And that children, is why Android video delivery sucks sometimes. :)"

There was a famous study called the Doll test which wikipedia can explain better than me.   They published three major papers between 1939 and 1940 on children's self-perception related to race. Their studies found contrasts among African-American children attending segregated schools in Washington, DC versus those in integrated schools in New York.[24] The doll experiment involved a child being presented with two dolls. Both of these dolls were completely identical except for the skin and hair color. One doll was white with yellow hair, while the other was brown with black hair.[25] The child was then asked questions inquiring as to which one is the doll they would play with, which one is the nice doll, which one looks bad, which one has the nicer color, etc. The experiment showed a clear preference for the white doll among all children in the study.[26] These findings exposed internalized racism in African-American children, self-hatred that was more acute among children attending segregated schools."

AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,Red-zedd,14,Tue Jul 21 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago, I saw a truly lovely lady sitting on the bus. I wished I had skin the colour of hers. I still do. Mine is pasty and pinkish and sort of reddish in places that the Sun has touched with splatters of freckles in odd places - a couple in very odd places. Hers was a beautiful dark honey that just glowed. Her hair was the black mine used to be before mine started going all colourless. I wanted to speak to her of this but I couldn't. Not because she was different but because she was a lovely lady and I was afraid of her. She was ever so young and vibrant and beautiful and I was shy and old and quite unprepossessing.     I sometimes wonder what she would have said had I spoken?"
AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,Red-zedd,6,Mon Jul 20 19:10:37 2015 UTC,It probably would've made her day if you said it to her!
AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,ImStatus,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:20 2015 UTC,One never knows how a lady will react. He was probably wise not to speak. Which is very sad.
AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,Quierochurros,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:06 2015 UTC,This is so true. I guess it just depends on what kind of mood she is/how she takes his compliment.

AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,SingleMulletTheory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"This is why. You come off creepy homie. Don't worry - it's something that can be fixed.   The deal is, you have a couple things going on - one is approach anxiety, very literally. What is the worst thing that happens if you tell a girl she looks sexy, and you'd like to learn a little bit more about her, see if she's a cool chick? ABSOLUTE WORST?  If you take out the outlandish chain of events that causes the zombie apoc....you're left with a ""No"". Here's the bitch of it. If every girl ever always said no to you - then it literally is exactly the same as you never asking in the first place. You float through life like a lump of crap waiting for something interesting to happen.  I've walked up to hundreds of complete strangers - women, and said all kinds of shit, really just whatever comes to mind. I mean hell, I have had a few girls draw a picture of themselves when they right down their number ""So I'll remember who's number this is"" and it's always hilarious. One girl in Maryland made me lose my shit laughing when she just drew an ass. Wanted me to remember her best feature.  I have been rejected TONS as well. Way more times than I have had successes. It's not about batting a thousand... There are three major components to the outcome of any interaction between two people.   You Her The Environment.   You ONLY have control over one of those, so you can't blame yourself if she's having an ultra shitty day - and bites your head off. It probably wasn't you, and honestly, there are SO MANY beautiful women out there, that you can afford to be picky and not get a total bitch.   When I go out, I literally am interviewing a chick to see if I'd like to spend time with her, from second one. I think the mistake 90% of guys make, is that they see a hottie, and they've already made up their mind they'll do whatever it takes.   Then it comes off EXACTLY like the message I'm replying to. WAY over the top, needy, and ""creepy"" (hate that word) and generally just very Beta. Then you italicized friends. The innuendo is weak, and she literally has you in her pocket already without trying.   Let me break it down for you like this....If someone is giving away Ford Mustangs, to anyone who wants em, and their free...everyone can have one, and every other vehicle costs money...do you know what would happen? People wouldn't value the mustang, because there is no value associated with it. Do you get upset as shit when you buy a tea, and accidentally drop it and spill it?   Humans associate value with effort. hundreds of guys tell pretty ladies every day that they are pretty much there to be had with no effort. Hell, some guys basically pay to be taken.  It isn't very attractive.  If some woman came up to you and threw herself at you, it'd be awesome right? What if 2-5 women did that every day? Then got pushy and mad when they wanted you to give them a little attention? Now think about a highly attractive woman - not a 10, but maybe an 8. There are no true 10s, male or female. I don't like that idea of perfect and there shouldn't be a perfect person, it'd be boring.   These girls literally have so many guys vying for their attention on an hourly basis it's retarded. I've dated some of these girls, and I'm friends with others like that - and hanging out with them can be annoying to me, and I'm sure they get annoyed, because they post a pic from a day out eating crab by the beach with me, and then for the next hour it's DING DING DING From the phone every few seconds. I dated an american apparel model for a while...and that exact scenerio happened. We steamed crabs on the beach and she posted a selfie around 6pm, and by 8 it had 312 likes, and around 67 comments from mostly dudes, basically saying they'd drink her bath water if they got to see where it came from.   Women in generally don't want a dude who's going to pour it on them from the get go. They want to feel like you learned enough about them to justify that kind of attraction. They do want to feel like more than just a piece of ass.   Don't try to gift a girl into liking you. It communicates that you don't think you're good enough for her without your wallet - like these gifts are all you have to offer. That doesn't mean never do nice shit - my current girl....she would tell you that I'm the nicest guy in the fucking world. She has told me that. I tease her that I'm just an asshole playing the long con game, and when it finally happens - it'll be huge. She just laughs.   but you can't just tell someone you're going to be good to them. That comes off as bullshit, and it's an oversale.   With the current chick, she was talking one day about different guys and all the shit that they try to do to win her affection, literally trying to be sugar daddies and shit. One dude offered to pay ALL of her bills, for one day a month. Shit, I was joking but I said hell, get him to pay mine and I can either make myself scarce for a day each month, or wear a push up bra and wax my backside. She just laughed. She told me specifically the thing that she likes the most about how I treated her and still do is that I let my actions talk for me.  She had a fucked up money situation happen early on - car issue that put her behind and she had a pretty bare cupboard and 45$ til pay day for her and her kid - I had never told her I'd do anything like this for her - she never expected it and I didn't want her to be with me because of shit like this....wrong reasons...  But I told her to meet me one day cause she left her shades in my car, and I was cleaning it out and didn't want to lose em, I was in wal mart parking lot if she wanted to drive by. No big.  I had 400$ cash and about 120$ worth of groceries - fruit, healthy stuff, and some kid stuff her son would like in a cart on the other side of my car. She's the kind of woman who doesn't accept shit like that. I fussed with her until she got it in the car, and when she got home she called my crying when she found the 400$ rolled up in a rubber band in one of the bags. I told her she was just holding it for me for a couple months so I didn't blow it at a bar or something.  Sometimes I try to hard. But it was on my terms.   Anyhow dude, I'm sure you're a fine person, and if you'd like to talk about this shit some, and maybe think about changing how you interact with women some - that is possible. I don't mind."
AdviceAnimals,3dyuqt,Tired-John,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:13 2015 UTC,I find that women are more willing to talk to you if you're not holding an armful of dildos when you approach them. You should try that.

It was just so healthy and bouncy and shiny, and I just said to her, ""your hair is just SO cute!""

Generally, forgiveness is a decision to let go of resentment and thoughts of revenge.   Forgiveness doesn't mean that you deny the other person's responsibility for hurting you. It doesn't minimize or justify the wrong, and it doesn’t mean you’ll ever be friends.   You can forgive the person without excusing the act.   Forgiveness brings a kind of acceptance and peace that helps you go on with life.  I take it as: OP is laughing at the friend request, then moving on with his life."

Just because some people went behind their spouses back and went to AM, doesn't mean that everyone that used the site was trying to subvert their significant other(s). Even more so, these are people who thought they were doing something in a secure and safe manner; only to have their private information spread around by people who had no right to see it. On top of that, there's people with same names that are going to potentially be mistaken for someone on the list from that site, and sisters/mothers/fathers/sons/ family members that will be made aware of other people's private lives.   If the people that hacked / spread the info wanted to punish AM for their shitty practices- then they should have gone for them directly. Instead, they went after potentially innocent people.

We are awarded sick time 2x per year, 5 days awarded each time.  We also have vacation and personal time.   The problem is that it's an absolute bitch to be approved for vacation/personal time. So you can plan a doctor's or dentist's appointment, submit your request for the personal time a month in advance, and get denied anyway.  This leaves your only recourse to use your sick time to get the time off that you need.  Chances are in a 6 month period it's pretty easy to have blown through your 5 days of sick time.  If you call in sick and don't have sick time left to use, you get written up. After 3 write ups you are fired.

AdviceAnimals,3dz2qj,shrekrepublic,17,Mon Jul 20 18:20:00 2015 UTC,I remember 3 olives per 6 inch. Our store owner was some kind of manic depressive and whenever she would come in to work she would watch you and chew you out after the customer left if you put more than that. Of course the customer would chew you out immediately if that's what you attempted to give them. Then they would aggressively ask for more and that made it okay in the owners eyes.
AdviceAnimals,3dz2qj,Jah_Ith_Ber,8,Mon Jul 20 20:50:34 2015 UTC,I remember when I worked at Subway the management came in one day and I made them a sandwich and I put more than 3 olives on it.  They told me 3 olives per 6 inch and I told them they were crazy.  No one who wants olives on their 6 inch wants 3 olives.
AdviceAnimals,3dz2qj,CallMeHawkeye,6,Tue Jul 21 02:18:14 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why subway employees applied pickle chips to my sandwiches like they were quarters from their paychecks..   Someone actually yells at you for making the sandwich good? That's a hell of a business model.
AdviceAnimals,3dz2qj,TheMoonstomper,3,Tue Jul 21 05:29:19 2015 UTC,Also why they throw a lb of lettuce on your sandwich.
AdviceAnimals,3dz2qj,JDSmith90,2,Tue Jul 21 06:37:08 2015 UTC,"depends on the the person in charge. when my manager isn't there I pack them, you're paying $8 for a footling might as well. but when he's watching over me he gets really angry and tells me not to ""spoil"" the customers. trust me, we don't want to count individual veggies."

Ultimately, they got the guy who stole it because we had signed into netflix, huluplus, and into the PSN account.

I read about therapies they can do for my PTSD all the time, but it's like I have no idea how to access those types of therapies. Every one I've gone to allegedly specializes in PTSD and anxiety, but again, it's just basically me talking for about an our every time I go, so I end up paying someone to let me vent, and that hasn't really improved much of anything.

AdviceAnimals,3dx8pl,tryptonite12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Have you tried sticking with a single therapist for a decent length of time?  It is definitely important to find one who you like and have a mutual respect with,  but it really is going to take 3+sessions just to pass beyond the ""getting to know eachother"" phase.  Truly successful therapy is going to likely be a years long process with the issues you describe. PTSD is tough, given that it's at least somewhat physiological as well as psychological in nature. A snap (and potentiality totally wrong) impression would be that, like many, you have had underlying issues with anxiety and depression, and something like PTSD could well have exacerbated those to the level they seem impossible to deal with on your own. Feel free to PM me if you would like,  not a therapist but I would be happy to listen and offer any help I can.  There are strategies and resources that you can utilize without professional help. A therapist is really just a (useful) ""tool"" to help you help yourself.  The Power of Now is a wonderful book that I have found very helpful. Best of luck my friend."

With one, we'd always get really off topic and start talking about movies or random cool shit, pretty much as if I were just venting to a friend.   The only one that I found particularly useful, kind of explained my feelings back to me with a really good intuition and then help me work through stress(needed help with stress management at the time). But she, as well as the first guy I mentioned, also thought we could move to just me showing up on an as needed basis because I'm ""self aware"" etc etc.   This is something I end up hearing a lot from each therapist I've had. I guess it's because I mostly get by until something really disruptive happens in my life. But I guess what is upsetting is that it's like I've made no progress because when something is disruptive, it's often not even a huge or drastic event, it's something with just enough familiar things to totally throw me into some kind of PTSD flip out that I don't realize is happening until much later, because I feel like I'm reacting rationally to everything."

None of which mean you are depressed.   In fact most people go by every day from activity to activity trying to distract themselves from ever having to think about their lives or feelings.   Life kinda sucks, doesn't mean your depressed. That said depression is a real and terrible thing but it's becoming like ADD where every ass hat on the internet has it."
AdviceAnimals,3dx8pl,Balticataz,5,Mon Jul 20 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"With depression you often won't have the motivation to try to distract yourself, though. With depression ""motivated"" can mean ""I got out of bed today"" or ""I didn't ruminate on an offhand comment for hours"". A key problem problem with trying to convey the difference between depression and normal, sometimes healthy, discontent is that the words to descrine these stronger emotions are co-opted for use in exaggerated statements. Also, words like motivation can exist on a large scale of intensity. So for someone without depression being unmotivated means ""meh I don't feel like it"" whereas with depression it means ""I'm mentally incapable of forcing myself to do it""."
AdviceAnimals,3dx8pl,tryptonite12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"For sure, because of the exact reasons you listed reddit or at least this sub isn't a great place for discussion about depression.

I don't give a fuck whats in his mind, whether its to grow his brand or to become president, because there is zero chance he succeeds. There is a one in a million chance he gets the republican nomination, but none that he wins.

AdviceAnimals,3dwcpt,Thesaurii,205,Mon Jul 20 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"He's working for Hillary to make Republicans look bad while making sure he's still unelectable enough not to get the nomination. When he looses the primary he'll start a 3rd party campaign to split the Conservative vote and make sure Hillary wins. He says that Bill Clinton was the best president of his lifetime, and he donated tons of money to Hillary's 2008 campaign. He was also a Democrat until 2009 and endorsed several Democratic candidates for Congress.   He knows that Republicans need hispanic voters, so he's attempting to alienate the hispanics. When election day rolls around, hispanic voters are going to remember what *Republican* Donald Trump said about Mexicans, and they will have a negative opinion of Republicans in general, even though Trump's comments don't represent the opinions of most Republicans. On top of that, when he runs third party the very anti-immigration crowd in states like Arizona and Texas will vote for him, splitting the Conservative votes in those states and giving them to Hillary, guaranteeing a Democrat victory. He doesn't have to worry about actually winning the GOP nomination, because he supports single-payer healthcare and a 15% wealth tax. Once the other candidates start to run ads against him highlighting this, he will fall out of the top tier.   I think his main goal is to flip Texas blue. With the combination of a large Hispanic population voting Democrat and Texas Republicans being generally very anti immigration and voting for him, Hillary will win the state despite winning less than 50% of the popular vote."

This time, he emerged as a member of the DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  He lasted eight years as a Democrat. In September 2009, Trump changed his affiliation, this time returning to the REPUBLICAN PARTY.  He has made more than $1.3 million in donations over the years to candidates nationwide, with 54 percent of the money going to Democrats, according to a Washington Post analysis of state and federal disclosure records.

AdviceAnimals,3dwcpt,poopy_wizard132,4,Mon Jul 20 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely not true.  Trump's name empire was worth $600 million before he entered the race, according to Forbes. His ""name empire"" is essentially the value of his brand - he uses it on TV, on merchandise, and on buildings he doesn't own (for a fee).  What's more, beyond this $600 mil, it's unclear how much he is actually worth. There's virtually zero chance that he owns his real estate outright - any semi competent businessman, with few exceptions, would leverage them (i.e. use debt to fund a large portion of them). The result is that even if Trump controls a lot of buildings, he may not have a lot of money. Trump is a notoriously bad operator - his value is in his name, but otherwise he has a reputation for running his businesses badly. That means that beyond the $600 mil, it's anyone's guess how much he's worth. Forbes says $4 billion total, but they're reliant on numbers from Trump to calculate that. The $600 mil is the only for sure asset.  And Trump has destroyed the $600 mil asset with this campaign. He no longer is on TV with The Apprentice. He has destroyed his pageant holdings by alienating his biggest fans. A lot of his merchandise got pulled out from under him. And his name is currently only popular with people who wouldn't enter the luxury market. Imagine you're a wealthy guy trying to network, and your business card says you work in the Trump building. Right now, that brand is ""racist who insults POWs."" And again, this crumbling part of his business is the only part of his wealth we can be positive exists.

I disagree with a lot that McCain says, and he has said some nutty things in the past, but I always remember how takes stands against torture, especially by the US, even when the majority of his party disagrees.   He actually was tortured, and so when he says waterboarding is torture, it carries more weight than someone who calls having to pay taxes for things they don't use torture.  He was booed for saying waterboarding is torture, he was booed for telling people not to use Muslim as an insult, and he was booed for telling a crowd not to shout lies about Obama. He might think some things I disagree with, even strongly, but he seems a decent man who stands for what he believes despite what others think.

The problem was, he was too moderate to win the Republican primary and get the nomination.     When he ran in 2008, he shifted to the right to win the primary, but couldn't move back to the middle without getting called out on flip flopping.

McCain got desperate and brought in Palin to counter Obama's novelty of being a black candidate.   It would have been a genius choice if Palin was somewhat informed on any issue outside of Alaska and kept to her role as VP candidate but, luckily for Dems, she was more interested in her newfound celebrity than winning the White House.

It was then marketed as a non-addictive cure for morphine addiction and like morphine, a cure for literally every kind of illness imaginable.  Oddly enough, Bayer synthesized and released the new drug Aspirin at the exact same time as Heroin and because the US didn't want another drug epidemic like they were having with opiates they offered Aspirin only by prescription, while heroin was sold over the counter along with morphine and codeine and opium tincture."

I'm not saying that judges always get it right, but there is a good likelihood that something else was going on if it was clearly shown that one parent was using drugs.

And even if he's not, does that really mean he should deny himself (sexual) human contact for ~9 months just because of a technicality that only exists on some sheet of paper deep in the basement of some city government building?  (Change ""him"" to ""her"" and it's the same. Also the same if they have kids or not.)"

Divorce will be the only outcome, but unfortunately, in Virginia you have to wait 1 year for a no fault divorce with kids involved.   She started dating 3 months after we split. I ain't even mad at her about it. I haven't because I'm too busy but I'm starting to get that itch (there's this really cute redhead at a store I frequent, I don't even care if it's dyed). The big difference will be that she won't know about my dating. I'm still trying to take the high road in this situation and play nice (naively?) She flaunted the fact that she was dating 3 guys in my face, even bringing one up to my place of employment. I guess to get a reaction, but like I said, I don't care."

She might not, I don't know her, but still, better safe than sorry.   Also, if she does happen to find out if you do, please post the petty, passive-aggressive text/Facebook messages for karma.

Because of the healthy soldier effect, military members have typically had much lower instances of suicide vs. the general public of the same demographic. Since OIF and OEF those rates have steadily increased, and have long since exceed the general public rates. So relative to the a non-deployed military, veteran suicide rates are much much higher.

AdviceAnimals,3dwykj,Averiella,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:08 2015 UTC,If someone wants to kill themselves theyll find a fucking way i can think of 30 ways just in my living room. Yet american soilders and marines have more weapons training than your local pd. weve fired everything from 9mm handguns to grenade launchers and at4's all of which would make these little cod fuckers cream their jeans. Now why is it that after spending years training to kill insurgents i cant carry a gun that is my constitutional right on an american bases? Giving the reason of ptsd and suicide is like saying civis are going to do the same thing its all bullshit. I took the oath to defend this country from both foreign and domestic threats but my right to carry a gun is taken from me at home.
AdviceAnimals,3dwykj,brikad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you can't carry a gun to school and many workplaces either. Constitutional rights can often be taken if it's deemed a public safety hazard (for example, peacefully protesting on a road, blocking traffic and causing jams vs. on a sidewalk or something).   We actually have seen a drop in suicide rates since the lack of guns in living areas and such on bases. Yes, there are many ways to kill yourself but often people don't want it to be painful and when presented with only painful or simply not quick enough options people tend to reconsider and that time of reconsideration can be used to get them help before another suicidal episode comes along.   Speaking of episodes, suicidal feelings (i.e. ""I want to kill myself) may always be there but the feeling of ""I'm going to kill myself right now"" tends to be more episode like, so it will be there for a short period and pass. If you don't have immediate access to a weapon like a gun then it'll take longer to accomplish a suicide than just going to another room, holding the gun up, and pulling a trigger which would give one time to have the episode pass.   Now whether or not it's the most effective short term option or if it's the best option for everyone involved, I don't know. I don't have a side on this debate and the only thing I desire is better mental health care for our soldiers and fucking tossing that shitty ""man up, be tough"" attitude that fucks all of them over on multiple levels."

Most states outright ban concealed carry on schools k-12 and even colleges (or they leave it to the discretion of the college and will act according to their rules) regardless of permit or not. There are exceptions to the bans that are generally for education purposes and very specific authorized programs and officers and such, or if it's locked away in your car following very specific guidelines, but that's it.

The best advice I have for knowing whether your partner is the one, is that if you can live together for one year, seeing each other every single day, and you both still want to see each other every single day, then you're ready. If you live together for one year and it's hell, then you can expect more to follow"
AdviceAnimals,3dwf6s,Callmedodge,8,Mon Jul 20 13:59:49 2015 UTC,They either rushed in or they watch too much romcom. Shit takes work to keep up. Getting married doesn't mean you don't have to keep doing the things you did leading up to the wedding. Complacency kills marriages.

AdviceAnimals,3dwf6s,Callmedodge,2,Mon Jul 20 14:20:06 2015 UTC,"That's just stuff people should be doing to each other regardless of whether they're in a marriage with that person or not.

We brought things up immediately and let the other person know how we felt and moved past it. People act like thats a massive secret or holy grail of advice but its so simple and easy it's not even funny.

My family love it for the videos and photos I can produce, my Dad loves how it works (And the fact he can inspect the roof with it), my Grandparents are amazed by it and love the media it makes, and I've already helped a local canal society by doing recording with them.  Honestly since I've gotten the drone I've done more than I've ever done, it sounds stupid but going out and getting a whole different perspective on life really helps.  However, to be brutally honest, for a first time flier, I would save the money and go for the Phantom 3 Professional instead of the Inspire.

It's because mobile phones and texting wasn't widespread yet, and devices that supported texting (pagers/beepers) was expensive. Sending a message was difficult too (We had to talk to an operator to write the message for us).  In the 90s, a typical home would have 1 landline that everybody had to share and the person in charge answers the phone by default.  We've come a long way.

Budget cuts imply staff cuts, and they focused their resources in the Refund department, so people can keep getting their money in a timely fashion.  Therefore, customer service suffers.  A lot.  I believe they estimated for Tax Season 2015, only half of the people who need to talk to a human being will get through to one.  They also lose power in the audit department when funding is cut.  If they don't have the manpower to enforce the tax code, the United States federal government loses billions in owed taxes.  Cutting a few million from the IRS budget results in the government losing billions of dollars.  Put another way, funding the IRS for another few million will result in the government getting billions more dollars of owed taxes (because audit and enforcement power will be up).  That's the very definition of a good investment.  If you knew you were gonna get back a thousand times as much money as you dumped into some investment, would you really turn it down?"

AdviceAnimals,3dw047,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,43,Mon Jul 20 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"So what is wrong with guys like me? I had a 6 year relationship end about a year and a half ago. Moved to a new city for a new start, went through all of the initial hell of newly single life and soul crushing depression on my own, and now I can't even get a second glance. I'm in decent shape being a carpenter and welder on my feet and working hard 8 hours a day. Inteligent. By most accounts funny. Not even worth being looked at, apparently. Most days I feel like I have three eyes and a giant hump on my back when I talk to women."
AdviceAnimals,3dw047,jokergod382,30,Mon Jul 20 05:06:06 2015 UTC,If you approach women with any of the saltiness that comes off in your comment that might be why. I'm sure you are an attractive decent guy but bitter/salty vibes are a red flag that will send a lot of prospective dates running. I appreciate its hard out there but if your frustration with dating leaks out when interacting with people it can be a problem.   I was on OKCupid and the worst thing guys could do was send me a salty/bitter message about the lack of responses they get so I had better please reply because it's not fair. They may have been great guys underneath that but the attitude was hard to get over when non bitter blokes would send messages too.   If you don't have a negative attitude though I have no idea. People are picky for stupid reasons sometimes. My mum is single because she can't get over trivial things like a guy having weird eyebrows. Drives me nuts.

There is no one out there for me and I've given up on making friends at this point. I tried my entire life to make friends, and that's all I was looking for when I moved, just friends. That has resulted in spending every celebratory holiday alone, my birthday alone, every day alone. That's why I gave up. At work I have plenty of laughs and people seem to enjoy my company and humor, but that has resulted in zero friendships outside of work. I gave up. I'm done. If I can't find a single friend out of people that seem to enjoy having me around than that means there is something wrong with me and I should sequester myself from everything socially.

However height (when this was still relevant) is a factor in terms of physical ability to protect/raise a family.  It's likely at least partially an evolutionarily motivated factor in sexual attraction.  Breast size preference, in my understanding is much more culturally/personally based."

We need to have lots of ads which opens the door to restricting tobacco advertisements, which  then allows the govt to deface cigarette packs, and from there we can hopefully get rid of cigarettes.   IMO, there should be more of them so that kids are scarred away from smoking. I grew up when the cool people on TV smoked and it always had that ""gritty"" appeal, if I saw ads of people speaking through voice boxes, laying in hospital beds dying, or saying goodbye to their loved ones then I don't think I would have ever started.

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,farning10,20,Mon Jul 20 09:06:01 2015 UTC,"which is wrong. What would happen is the supply would shoot up, so the price would crash, making it a viable option for a lot of applications for which it was previously too expensive, so the demand would go up. The only thing that would remain constant if the numbers are just right is the amount of money spent on platinum in a year, not the price per gram of platinum."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,Kwantuum,91,Mon Jul 20 09:51:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. Diamonds are common as hell and have marginal value, but they are very expensive because supply is tightly controlled. If the US government wrangled an asteroid and mined all of the platinum out of it, they aren't going to flood the world market with it. They will strictly control it as to not completely devalue it.

If diamonds were actually rare I'd wager they'd be more expensive. Diamonds don't really have that much industrial use, so maintaining the luxury market for them is more important than for platinum. When aluminum became readily available, albeit where anyone could mine it, it become essential for industry and the price dropped precipitously.   Also, if Tesla wrangles it they'll probably be less stingy than Russia did the same."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,captmarx,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"The distinction here is that aluminum is all over the Earth and anyone can mine it. An asteroid is sitting out there in space and is only really mineable by one entity. It's not really an apt comparison. As I said, the price of platinum in this scenario would probably drop a little, but supply would be tightly controlled as to keep the price unnaturally inflated."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,IMLOwl,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"Diamonds don't really have that much industrial use   Stop right there.

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,computeraddict,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"Right. Supply and demand as most people think of it is a myth. The market value or price of something is determined more by belief or perception. Diamonds are perceived by the market to be valuable so the price stays high.  If you were to convince enough people that diamonds are in fact worthless, people would spend less money on them or stop buying them completely and the price would tank.  In the case of the asteroid, if the US captured it the price of platinum could still tank because the market would be aware how much the US was holding and that could start a panic."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,Adhmad_Dubh,4,Mon Jul 20 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"People tend to think of textbook supply and demand, which operates under the assumption that markets are perfectly competitive. In this case, the platinum mining market would not be. If dozens of nations and companies decided to mine their own asteroids for platinum, then yes, each entity with a stake in the market would keep undercutting the others in price until platinum cost was low."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,IMLOwl,3,Mon Jul 20 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Markets can actually be far from competitive, sometimes even anti-competitive. Nobody smart would keep undercutting. They would use their predictive formulas to figure out pricing and keep the price high enough to be worth it. Anyone sitting on that kind supply would also probably try to keep it a secret.  The scenario where the price tanks could only happen when somebody does something stupid or there is panic in the market. The asteroid scenario could cause panic.  Oil is another fun one. I don't think it's a coincidence that the price tanks right after its announced that renewables are becoming cheaper than oil. Supply isn't the problem. It's people."

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,snarkyquark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"You're conflating some economic terms. It's important to distinguish between supply, demand, and the quantity supplied and purchased. In this case, recovering the asteroid would shift the supply curve to the right. This moves the equilibrium price down and the quantity supplied/consumed up (to the right). The demand curve itself never moves in the short term of this scenario."
AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,computeraddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"The price would crash, so people currently trading in terrestrial platinum would see the value of their stockpiles, mining leases, etc. evaporate.  However, if an order of magnitude more platinum were available because of access to an asteroid, then much more platinum could be sold - so even at a fraction of the old price per ounce, more money in total could be made.  Think of Aluminum.  It was once the most valuable metal on Earth, so valuable that Emperor Napoleon III had his best dinnerware made from it.  Very soon afterwards a new process was invented that made aluminum drastically cheaper - so cheap that you could eventually make disposable cans and siding for houses out of it.  So many uses were devised for this cheap metal that the aluminum industry now contributes about 150 billion USD to the American economy every year."

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,Ohbeejuan,0,Mon Jul 20 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"But you're already telling me that supply would massively exceed demand. If it hadn't the price wouldn't go down to begin with, and it wouldn't find more applications.  The logic here is that platinum is expensive because it's scarce, but if we had a lot of it people would use more because it's inexpensive, but using it will also keep the metal scarce and expensive?

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,computeraddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"Half a century ago titanium used to be more expensive and rarely seen any products directed to normal consumer. During that time Soviet Union already used it in large scale for military purposes. They made for example titanium helmets that would have been exorbitantly expensive in other countries. If platinum has something similar strategical value in military applications like platinum is even denser than uranium so it could make excellent replacement for depleted uranium in armors and ammunition, then we might see that asteroid mined in some point.

AdviceAnimals,3dw2mz,computeraddict,0,Mon Jul 20 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"...there is no information pointing to the conclusion that the price would stay the same. A massive change in supply would reduce price, then research into more applications would be looked into. In the time it would take to make new applications, the massive drop in price would run producers (e.g. Mines in Siberia and whatnot) out of business.   It is much more likely that production levels would find equilibrium than exactly the same change in supply would be seen as a change in demand.  Changes in quantity supplied and quantity demanded do not directly interact. And there is no basis whatsoever to think that a massive change in supply would ""equalize"" to the same price. That's not how economics works. If it did, the new applications for platinum would be run out of business just as if they were tried today."

What I'd do is partner with a bunch of car companies in an equity-for-materials exchange (e.g. Tesla) where I became the supplier of the platinum and they give me stock instead of cash. Refuse to partner with anyone who doesn't give you favorable outcomes, while leaving enough on the table for friendlies to profit. With the cash you'd encourage R&D into fuel-cell technology with the goal of putting a fuel-cell vehicle in 20% of American homes by Year 10.   Keep in mind you already have the reputation of being the first company to harvest materials from a gigantic space asteroid, that's guaranteed to give you brand equity. Pump a few stories each year in the media on fuel-cell battery progress, get the first electric vehicles rolling off the assembly line in 5 years. Pretty sure all the stock in companies you exchanged your asteroid for will skyrocket. Continue development into heavy vehicles, promote a CO2 free future agenda, and continue expanding on your 20% monopoly. You'll probably be a trillion dollar company in 30 years.
