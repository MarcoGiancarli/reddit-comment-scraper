But I would like an in-the-pocket groove. Not really a ""solo teaser"" but more of a just keep a 4/4 beat with straight 8th and 16th note fills and smash some cymbals.  BUT. Yubin does have a very very hot image, so I guess that made up for it partially, to keep the hype going!"

Are we going to get a legit rock song here or some bubblegum rock? If its like AOAs get out id be happy.  This already looks better than AOA black.   This has the potential to be insanely good. The teasers are insanely good. I really hope the song actual is just not boring, unoriginal, cheesy, strait up bad."

I'm glad to see something like this exists--even if it's kinda cheesy it's still an important message conveyed in a fun way.  The video was super cute, I really liked all the student involvement! Especially the orchestral break and the part with Jaehyo and the students on instruments. Actually tbh this video is superior to the original just because of the increased Jaehyo screen time."

kpop,3e2cwn,kseulgi,6,Tue Jul 21 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"well anyway. japanese usually sounds awkward to me in songs that were initially written to be korean, but this is surprisingly natural"
kpop,3e2cwn,jakobdorof,6,Tue Jul 21 17:56:53 2015 UTC,What are people talking about? I'm pretty sure I hear Sulli here.
kpop,3e2cwn,ebosher,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with y'all? Sulli IS singing here lol she's singing all her parts? Her voice sounds a bit deeper than the kr version (I'm talking about her first part) but I'm 100% sure that's Sulli here, no way it's Amber lol And even if you somehow believe Amber took her parts how do you explain Sulli still being in the MV as we've seen in the preview released weeks ago? pls"
kpop,3e2cwn,bloppa,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:27 2015 UTC,it's definitely sulli lol amber's barely in this
kpop,3e2cwn,yvvno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:56 2015 UTC,Around 1:30 it does sound a lot like Sulli. It doesn't sound like any other member so idk
kpop,3e2cwn,zazubidi,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:41:23 2015 UTC,I just listened another 20times and the first part sounds like Luna too not Amber at all :( I give up i just want the official version to know for sure

And even if we want to argue about her first part, what about the one @ 1:24, you can't say that's not Sulli come on lol It's the exact same MV because they were filmed together, but you can see Victoria is singing to Japanese lyrics and at the very end you see Sulli winking and that part is not on the Pinocchio KR MV."

kpop,3e2cwn,HamAaron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"Amber's tone is completely different??? lol I don't understand how anyone could say that's amber singing that part, it's so clearly Sulli to me lol As I already said it is true that that part is lower than in the KR version but that's exactly how Sulli's voice sounds like when she doesn't force a cute voice, like on Ending Page."
kpop,3e2cwn,bloppa,4,Tue Jul 21 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say, i honestly don't understand how anyone could say that's Amber so let's just agree to disagree and wait for the MV lol Try listening to this Sulli's part sounds a lot similar to the one in the jp version here"
kpop,3e2cwn,bloppa,0,Tue Jul 21 17:40:07 2015 UTC,The denial is strong in this one.  It's Amber. Sulli isn't to be heard in this and that video you linked is years old.
kpop,3e2cwn,TonerKebab,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:24 2015 UTC,The video I linked is the commercial that was aired in Japan prior to the release of the CD and it's the video on the limited edition of the CD that was released today and I already explained why it's not the KR version but the JP one lol
kpop,3e2cwn,bloppa,0,Tue Jul 21 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"""It's the exact same MV because they were filmed together.""  So it was filmed in 2011, way before the Sulli drama. How does that prove your point that she's in this song?"
kpop,3e2cwn,TonerKebab,0,Tue Jul 21 18:02:34 2015 UTC,Other than the fact that we can hear her? lol because to film the MV you need to have the song recorded first? and they did record the song first and since Sulli is in the MV it's obvious she's in the song as well cause otherwise they'd rerecord the MV without her?
kpop,3e2cwn,bloppa,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are questioning you. They're releasing an old music video and song. Sulli is in it because it's an old MV/song. Whether or not Sulli's in the group or not, this song was recorded a while ago, so she's in the song."
kpop,3e2cwn,aywaitaminute,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"Sulli's in it. Someone had a clip from the music video. It's an old music video that was recorded a while ago.  edit: Oh, whoops, didn't see that someone had posted this already."

She looked like a total pro. Another example is this video where Soyou prepares a simple meal, she just seems so cool.

What's funny is that those who criticized the superficiality of this MV are precisely those who didn't try to see further than the apparent sexiness of the MV.
kpop,3e186n,fryestone,9,Tue Jul 21 11:02:51 2015 UTC,Seems to me this writer wants to see some special meaning in every image.  Also he points out how Stellar came up with all those metaphors and deeper meanings while I doubt their actual influence on the song and mv.
kpop,3e186n,kpgfisty,10,Tue Jul 21 13:30:05 2015 UTC,I was thinking something similar. It's possible the songwriter had deeper meanings that they wanted to reach for but I doubt Stellar had any real sway over it

kpop,3e186n,fryestone,6,Tue Jul 21 16:53:19 2015 UTC,I DID NOT WRITE THIS. and I'm not taking any credit for any of the work. I'm just sharing it because it made me appreciate the writer and Stellar so much more.
kpop,3e186n,seattlantis,6,Tue Jul 21 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the symbolism of the MV but in watching it and the trajectory of their career in general, I can't help but worry about their autonomy in all this shock value stuff. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I think some people want Stellar to be more clever or meta than they are because just trying to survive after so many years of struggle is a lot less sexy."
kpop,3e186n,fryestone,6,Tue Jul 21 13:11:35 2015 UTC,"Almost every kpop idol group is trying to survive.   It's interesting to see how you all don't pity Apink even though their situation is almost worse than Stellar.  Apink is stuck in their cute concepts and they have no control over it. They tried to be more mature, sometimes sexier but they had a huge backlash from the fans.  For their comeback, they said that they wanted to express something different but they couldn't. So they did what they could do in the cute realm. Doesn't this leave a bad taste in your mouth as well ?  Stellar in the other hand is free to experiment any music as long they're sexy. Granted, their agency has the control for now but as they're getting more and more popular, the girls will be able to bring their own touch into the final product. (If they aren't already)"
kpop,3e186n,machyna,3,Tue Jul 21 14:56:18 2015 UTC,You're assuming that the same people who don't like these desperation sexy concepts are 100% okay with adult women who have to play into an innocence concept for their male fans.   I think you are being incredibly optimistic about how much control Stellar has.
kpop,3e186n,mylord420,0,Tue Jul 21 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not.  And I just said that the agency (probably) has the control. Did you misread my post?"
kpop,3e186n,machyna,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:41 2015 UTC,"lol at this analysis. notice how the author has no specific examples of how this music video is subversive. if anything it's clinging to traditional, patriarchal concepts of female sexuality, what with the passive ""come and get it oppa"" lyrics and the bloody imagery of busted vaginas that allude to breaking a hymen.  and i'm not even gonna get into the questionable consent of these idols to being exploited like this. the fact this is being interpreted as some kind of sexually liberating feminist masterpiece is depressing."
kpop,3e186n,leechelle,5,Tue Jul 21 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"Idols jobs are literally to be exploited. They are exploited for capital, they are exploited for their bodies, for their image, to sell products, everyrhing. Its all exploitation and they have no control over their choices. Most of the time after years they havent even made any money.  This is complete and utter capitalization and exploitation of a human being. Modern day volunteer slavery."
kpop,3e206u,steinsman,3,Tue Jul 21 10:03:18 2015 UTC,Looking forward to this release from one of my fave underrated singers~

kpop,3e09bn,Chiniro,4,Tue Jul 21 06:00:27 2015 UTC,THANK YOU FOR THIS!
kpop,3e09bn,iliketoytules,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:25 2015 UTC,Yesss!! ive been waiting 5ever for this!

kpop,3e09bn,adonis8,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I've been waiting since the snippets started coming out!"
kpop,3e09bn,eatinglegos,3,Tue Jul 21 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"Awh, it was nice seeing EXID with their families and spending time together. It was really touching when Hani read that letter to her dad. Can't wait for the next episode!"
kpop,3e09bn,UniversalChimera,3,Tue Jul 21 05:50:43 2015 UTC,"Boy, I feel bad for not falling for LE sooner. She's just adorable."
kpop,3e09bn,mylord420,5,Tue Jul 21 11:02:34 2015 UTC,"Hitler didn't sub this, I'm afraid it may not be dank enough."
kpop,3e09bn,theaznrunner,2,Tue Jul 21 09:06:11 2015 UTC,Bit of a slow ep at bits but I can relate to Solji and her bro (except for her being all famous and stuff) .. that's true sibling relationship right there.   Thanks for sharing/subbing!
kpop,3e09bn,nighoblivion,-14,Tue Jul 21 06:17:06 2015 UTC,"An episode full of awkward. No wonder Exid Storage didn't sub it quickly.  Hani's parts were enjoyable and not too awkward, at least. Especially when food was served."
kpop,3e09bn,curel1,8,Tue Jul 21 04:42:51 2015 UTC,lol This wasn't awkward. I mean you could tell that their families were a bit nervous but it was a hilarious ep overall.
kpop,3e09bn,eatinglegos,4,Tue Jul 21 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean all the members are naturals with the camera, their families aren't/were surprised with the camera."
kpop,3e09bn,nighoblivion,-10,Tue Jul 21 05:42:43 2015 UTC,lol This wasn't awkward.   I beg to differ.
kpop,3e09bn,creezle,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:05 2015 UTC,He's also a one man team and said it would take time to sub an episode iirc
kpop,3dyawc,steinsman,40,Mon Jul 20 15:02:56 2015 UTC,Anyone with band/bass experience can tell us if she's good or not?
kpop,3dyawc,rhinoreno,29,Mon Jul 20 15:52:58 2015 UTC,Based on this clip I'd say she's good. Great teaser.
kpop,3dyawc,Elnathan,54,Mon Jul 20 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"From this clip, she's pretty good. Using a variety of styles and staying on beat while playing a nice riff or two. Putting it simply, if this is a showcase of her skill, she could outplay a lot of standard rock band bassists."
kpop,3dyawc,Surtir,20,Mon Jul 20 17:26:11 2015 UTC,Say what?! That's pretty fucking awesome.
kpop,3dyawc,rhinoreno,40,Mon Jul 20 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not saying too much because a lot of standard rock band bassists don't do much other than keep a 4/4 beat on whatever note the rhythm guitarist is playing, but she could probably play some funk and some harder rock pretty well based on this clip."
kpop,3dyawc,Surtir,10,Mon Jul 20 17:53:46 2015 UTC,"I almost just fell out of my seat as soon as she started slapping. Even in most rock bands, slapping isn't a commonly used technique (depending on the genre of course, but in most of the pop/rock bands that people know about)"
kpop,3dyawc,Uanaka,10,Mon Jul 20 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"""pretty good!?"" for someone who had never (seriously?) touched the bass until recently, and began learning in her 20s, this is so crazy. if this take isn't comped to death and she can actually play like this live, this demonstrates crazy chops. if she gets comfortable enough to play like that without looking at the fretboard she could practically tour for prince"
kpop,3dyawc,jakobdorof,4,Tue Jul 21 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"Idk why youre being downvoted, but you're right. Hopefully we will be able to see her skills live. By the looks of it, she's pretty confident."
kpop,3dyawc,cjbt,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:56 2015 UTC,"So, I quickly looked her up when you said she started learning in her 20s because I wanted a better grasp on how long she's been playing. What the actual shit? She's only 23? Had this idea that the Wonder Girls members were a lot older than that for some reason. Impressive in any case."
kpop,3dyawc,Adriaan_Hoekman,4,Tue Jul 21 06:34:37 2015 UTC,"i did the exact same thing when making that point! crazy. yeeun and yubin are a bit older, 26, but yeah they were all way young in their heyday."
kpop,3dyawc,jakobdorof,16,Tue Jul 21 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"Well, she's better than I am, so there's that.  Time to practice."
kpop,3dyawc,Tzic,6,Mon Jul 20 18:33:53 2015 UTC,this is UNBELIEVABLE
kpop,3dyawc,jakobdorof,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"Solid. Good groove going on, and slap bass is more impressive than just about anything a k-pop band's ever used.  Question remains to be how complex they'll make the material."
kpop,3dyawc,equilibriphile,34,Tue Jul 21 14:36:38 2015 UTC,"She's literally oozing sexy just by standing there and playing the bass, holy shit"
kpop,3dyawc,scarletapples,24,Mon Jul 20 19:05:01 2015 UTC,"This is why Sunmi was, is, and always will be maximum top bae."
kpop,3dyawc,McToasterz,23,Mon Jul 20 16:07:07 2015 UTC,Top baes?  Yea I know it was terrible.

kpop,3dyawc,Elnathan,45,Mon Jul 20 18:06:48 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/DSvY8Nc.gif  This is fucking ridiculous! She's killing it! Who's playing what in the band?  PS #teamYubin
kpop,3dyawc,DrrrtyRaskol,18,Mon Jul 20 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"Yeeun will be on the piano, Yubin on drums, and Lim will be playing the guitar. I really can't wait to see Yubin's drum solo!"
kpop,3dyawc,TotoroTataroo,9,Mon Jul 20 16:06:10 2015 UTC,Team Yubin reporting in! So excited to see my first bias group come back after such a long hiatus.
kpop,3dyawc,Trn4mr,4,Mon Jul 20 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit iffy with it, if it's with the technical skill that Sunmi played with the bass then I'm excited. But if she just ends up doing a typical 4/4 rock groove with basic fills, it'll destroy my expectations. As a drummer, even seeing the idol rock groups like CNBlue and FT. Island are always a little bit of a downer."
kpop,3dyawc,Uanaka,3,Mon Jul 20 21:50:40 2015 UTC,The technicality is almost never going to be exciting for these Korean pop-rock groups. At most you'll get some nice sounding vocal harmonies or guitar/piano licks. Expect standard 4/4 rock bass and drums.
kpop,3dyawc,5thEagle,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"I know, which is why I don't mind it much. Because I've seen how it is based on CNBlue and FT Island, my expectations of a live performance are relatively slim."
kpop,3dyawc,Uanaka,53,Tue Jul 21 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"LORDY I'm so excited for a legit band concept, and if it sounds anything like this teaser, sultry, funky, it's gon' be so good. This is truly the second girl group heyday since the golden age of 2007-2011."
kpop,3dyawc,CronoDroid,18,Mon Jul 20 15:12:21 2015 UTC,FUCKING HYPE  This whole thing gave me chills
kpop,3dyawc,Teitoku,19,Mon Jul 20 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sold. I don't like Wonder Girls' older stuff, it just never appealed to me...but this! This is right up my alley!"
kpop,3dyawc,latebaroque,16,Mon Jul 20 15:47:18 2015 UTC,GUESS IM GETTING INTO WONDER GIRLS
kpop,3dyawc,OrderEntropy,15,Mon Jul 20 15:58:55 2015 UTC,And the Wonder Girls are back!  I'm excited to see how this goes. Hope it's awesome
kpop,3dyawc,ThatDangDoe,8,Mon Jul 20 15:18:32 2015 UTC,And the Wonder Girls are back!   WG is what got me into this Kpop stuff. I'll be keeping tabs on this.
kpop,3dyawc,radhumandummy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"heh, tabs."
kpop,3dyawc,lordvipomme,12,Tue Jul 21 10:35:37 2015 UTC,August is going to be wonderful!
kpop,3dyawc,verylargebongo,14,Mon Jul 20 15:11:05 2015 UTC,"Wow! Most of the kpop band concepts I've seen seemed incredibly naff, so I feared the the WGs. But this looks seriously promising. I wonder if they're going to be writing their own material as well?"
kpop,3dyawc,meganega,8,Mon Jul 20 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"Lately JYP artists have a bit more freedom than usual - Yeeun's solo album was pretty much her working alongside Collapsedone (and not JYP-made tracks), so I'm optimistic that they'll have some their own material on the album (or at least Yeeun's)"
kpop,3dyawc,scarletapples,7,Mon Jul 20 19:02:37 2015 UTC,Now dont get carried away.
kpop,3dyawc,mylord420,11,Mon Jul 20 18:50:48 2015 UTC,holy crap that was actually sexy as fuck. Sunmi's still keepin' her style even while playing the bass. It actually made me super excited for their comeback even though I was really skeptical about it before.
kpop,3dyawc,jjaebum,10,Mon Jul 20 17:30:30 2015 UTC,This looks and sounds amazing. Really excited to see them all playing.
kpop,3dyawc,ramzakreiss,10,Mon Jul 20 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"I hope this lights a fire under FNCs ass to bring AOA black back. But in all honesty the quality of playing here from Sunni blows Minas bass playing out of the water. And Mina is a better bass player than Choa and Jimin are guitar players. Their skills are pretty much limited to strumming.  This is very exciting. What is sad though is that just like AOA black, all the music shows arent even going to let them plug in and play live. So all that talent that may have gained just to pretend to play instruments until they have an opportunity to do a real live concert."
kpop,3dyawc,mylord420,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:32 2015 UTC,There's always YHY's Sketchbook.
kpop,3dyawc,friedchocolatesoda,4,Tue Jul 21 00:17:00 2015 UTC,I for one am hopeful for a band concept arms race.
kpop,3dyawc,everydayathrowaway,7,Mon Jul 20 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"Still the term ""band concept"" saddens me because at the end of the day, the band is just a concept. Just like sports or firemen or school girls or at the beach or tap dancing or pole dancing or anything else is a concept. We would love them to be an actual band but that isnt the case. I think wouldnt it be awesome if jimin choa and mina were sitting in the practice room coming up with sick new riffs. But that is just a fantasy. Itd be sick if these groups switched to band concept forever, as in only band concept, that is their identity. Better than just a one off."
kpop,3dyawc,mylord420,3,Mon Jul 20 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"True, I would love it if the idols were given more autonomy and were able to guide their overall concept (rather than changing concepts at the whim of the company). However in the meantime I will accept temporary gimmicky band concepts as a substitute."
kpop,3dyawc,everydayathrowaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"Now Hyukoh is getting popular, and now the Wonder Girls are doing a band concept. This could spark more bands/band concepts in becoming popular."
kpop,3dyawc,eatinglegos,8,Tue Jul 21 02:56:47 2015 UTC,Finally! Sunmi looks sexy as fuck playing that bass. Can't wait to see the rest!
kpop,3dyawc,TotoroTataroo,6,Mon Jul 20 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, although I'm a drummer, I have played with many bassists. And the fact that she played harmonics, at about the :16-:18 second typically shows she knows a lot more than the typical quarter note strumming to keep in time.   Moving along, she's doing a run-of-the-mill groove jam, until the most mindblowing (keep in mind, standards of an idol, not a typical bassist) slapping riff which just amazes me. Although it's not necessarily a difficult concept, it's above the standards of most rock band bassists who just  ""dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum"""
kpop,3dyawc,Uanaka,5,Mon Jul 20 21:48:41 2015 UTC,I've never realized how much Sunmi looks like 4minute's Jihyun
kpop,3dyawc,chairmanchang,19,Mon Jul 20 15:57:15 2015 UTC,That might be because they never show what Jihyun looks like.
kpop,3dyawc,sargeantb2,3,Mon Jul 20 17:23:53 2015 UTC,Savage

kpop,3dyawc,_cornflake,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"I scrolled through all the comments, hoping to see someone bring this up! Slapping, hammers, riffs, harmonics. It actually kind of convinces me, that she practiced far longer than the comeback was planned. It's not technically difficult things, but if she's going to incorporate it into the song... especially with slapping.. ugh."
kpop,3dyawc,Uanaka,5,Mon Jul 20 21:52:09 2015 UTC,This is pretty fucking cool.

kpop,3dyawc,ontherice,7,Mon Jul 20 15:52:15 2015 UTC,Yubin.

kpop,3dyawc,Zipperumpazoo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:38:41 2015 UTC,That was awesome. WG has worked with instruments before and it didn't look that great. But they were mainly props. So I have reassurance that it won't be the same as those stages. I can't wait. It feels good to be a Wonderful right now. It's been too many years.
kpop,3dyawc,mmemmetee,5,Mon Jul 20 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever been so hyped for a comeback. Wonder Girls were one of the first Kpop girl groups I ever got into years ago. Their breakup devistated me. But now they're coming back with this amazingness?! I'm so happy with this teaser. Sunmi looks beautiful and I love her dress. Nice to see that she can actually play too. Seems like JYP is putting a lot into this comeback, as he should."

kpop,3dyawc,SCCKZY,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:30 2015 UTC,I still can't believe a Wonder Girls comeback is actually happening! Sunmi is so cool and I'm officially on board for the band concept!
kpop,3dyawc,lilacdawn,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:54 2015 UTC,I'll wait for the actual MV before I decide to like this or not.
kpop,3dyawc,Enter_Text_Here,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:10 2015 UTC,Are they really going to be playing the instruments? Reminds me of After School days when they basically learnt a new skill for every comeback.   Can't wait for the full single!

I'm honestly hoping this turns out to be a very dark, heavy oriented song.  Given the techniques that Sunmi shows off in this video, there is a possibility that this song will actually be complex in terms of instrumentality; which would be an awesome thing to have.  All I can do is sit and wait; the anticipation is killing me.  Regardless, it is fantastic to see the Wonder Girls come back.  now about that after school comeback Pledis.."

Actually could end up like that … hoping for the best Also it would be cool/funny if Sunmi just stuck with a dark concept forever no matter what the group/song concept is
kpop,3dyawc,nnworb,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"AOA's band concept was not gimmicky, although, if you watched the live versions of MOYA, it is awkward because I find almost every member, except Youkyung, not playing their instruments."

kpop,3e1vo7,felarel,6,Tue Jul 21 11:28:18 2015 UTC,"It's not plagiarized, but it is similar on purpose. That's not plagiarism though. Read this:   Remember this: for a song to be considered as plagiarized, it doesn’t have to just sound the same, it has to actually be the same to a very substantial extent. These are two fairly different things, especially when accounting for all the different ways that different people hear music. Someone vocally trained would have easily noticed the differences between the two vocal lines without me having to break it down, but to a layperson it might just indeed sound exactly the same. Just like two different chocolates might taste the same to someone who has never tasted chocolate before, but might actually be pretty fuckin’ different."
kpop,3e1vo7,Yelesa,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"cool, its still pretty bad to make a song that sounds so similiar, wheres creativity?"
kpop,3e1vo7,felarel,9,Tue Jul 21 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"You've never listened to more than one 12-bar blues song, have you?  You could grab any instrument from any song, toss it in a different song, and as long as it's in the right key...  It's very possible to be creative when staying extremely close to the style of an existing song.  I'm not a fan of the word ""plagiarism"" over what it actually is, ""copyright infringement.""  That said, none of the examples in this video would hold up in court, they differ in melody, and mostly also the chord progressions."
kpop,3e1vo7,Desirsar,4,Tue Jul 21 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"You've never listened to more than one 12-bar blues song, have you?    The article I mentioned did have that tibit. It also had this video about pop music hits using the same chords for over 40 years. They keep using it, because it is not plagiarism to sound similar.  Here's another video demonstrating the common meter. If we use OP's logic of plagiarism, the Pokemon theme is plagiarized from Amazing Grace."
kpop,3e1vo7,Yelesa,6,Tue Jul 21 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"Did you read the rest? There are only a few note combinations that are pleasant to the human ear, so they get recycled a lot. That is true for pop music, blues, jazz, metal and even classical music. Everything is ""plagiarized"" except not really. It's only plagiarized when they sound exactly the same for a substantial amount, not just similar. Exactly the same for a substantial amount. Everything else is fair game."
kpop,3e1vo7,Yelesa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Which combinations are you thinking of in particular? Leading tone to tonic, tonic-mediant-dominant, tonic-supertonic-mediant (and its combinations), and tonic-subdominant?   Have to say that as a metal head, I do hear less of that (half-step resolutions aside; metal loves resolving that dissonance) than I would in say, jazz or classic rock."

I don't know which Lee Hyori's is supposed to be, but I'm not surprised someone listed it as in Spanish up there. Probably Italian from the way amor is used in Italian.

My problem with Fantagio Music and Brave Brothers is that they don't utilise Seoyoung. I mean, even with her one or two lines in this song, her parts just feel really out of place from the whole feel of the song.    She's actually a semi competent vocalist in terms of pitch, power (obviously) and delivery; however, because Nara, Yooyoung and Yeoreum or whatever her name pretty much mumble their lines, it seems like they have no idea where to slot her belting into any of there songs properly yet. It's a shame because I feel like with the right song, she could stand out for the right reasons instead of the wrong reasons. She's slowly climbing up my bias list too (no one is gonna replace Yoonjo tho), she just looks like she is always having the best time on stage and I love Bagel girls in K-pop.  I mean if they (BB) can make Hyorin's voice fit so well with Soyu's voice in their older songs (not bashing anyone, they're just very different voices) then they can make Hello Venus sound more cohesive."

kpop,3dxt7t,kty39,143,Mon Jul 20 12:30:30 2015 UTC,"Just gonna share my personal opinion here. I won't try to force you to feel either way, but just expressing things from my perspective. No sources, no article references. Take it with a pinch of salt. These are just the things I observed after following SNSD for years.  Taeyeon gets the most shit from people as the leader of SNSD. You see most leaders from other groups doing all the talking and group messages etc, but for SNSD this isn't always the case. Taeyeon lets other members get the limelight in interviews and speeches, but like all things, she gets reactions from both sides of the coin. Some praised her for being thoughtful, others called her a redundant leader for not making any difference in SNSD.   In many occasions, Tiffany and Sunny had described her as being a friend who is hard to understand. She mostly keeps to herself and never really talk about her inner worries to the other members. Taeyeon had mentioned that she feels lonely and had not many friends to talk with. This could be a sign of depression, but then again who are we to know? Fans again give her shit for that, saying that she doesn't appreciate her members who are always there for each other, calling her weak-minded and untrustworthy to others.  The creation of her Instagram was the epitome of all shits. The drama with Baekhyun and the fan backlash from the alledged 'betrayal' put her in a worse name by the hardcore fans who had thought that her IG account was for them and not her boyfriend.  From there it went downhill. Jessica left SNSD and people blamed her for 'not protecting SNSD', blamed her for letting Jessica go, blamed her for being an attention seeker and basically put all the fault on Taeyeon for fucking up SNSD.  Whatever she said from then on, people will screw it up.   Posting happy pics  on IG? - ""Well I bet she's happy now that Sica is gone.""  Cries and apologies. - ""Goddamn this attention seeking biatch, save your tears""  Seriously, as a human being, how much of these nonsense can one take? Some people here mentioned Justin Beiber and how he basically doesn't give 2 fucks about his haters. I don't know about Western fans, but when K-fans get batshit crazy to the point where your family gets involved, shit can go down.  Unlike JB, some people may hate him for life, and may wish death upon him, but have literally no idea how many siblings he has and how does his dad looks like. But for K-fans, if they hate you they will assault your mother, your father, and basically your entire family tree 2 generations up and down the line.  People like Tablo had suffered through more crazy shit than this, but still stuck with it till the end. While the hate for Taeyeon is not at THAT level yet, I do hope this action by her would tone things down. No idol deserves to go through such toxic malice."
kpop,3dxt7t,ArxDignitas,28,Mon Jul 20 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this post. I went on Twitter and the amount of people talking shit on about how she's being unnecessary suing people and how she's just a cry baby is toxic. I'm almost certain that they know nothing about TY or what she's gone through because this is far from just ""crying for attention"" now. It's even worse for TY because it seems like she has a quite a bit of the EXO-L fandom specifically against her so they constantly add on to the hate. A TY fanclub is trying to gather evidence (in English as well) to send over to SM, but I'm not really sure what kind of action they'd be able to take against i-netizens."
kpop,3dxt7t,Steppls,14,Mon Jul 20 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"Taeyeon had mentioned that she feels lonely and had not many friends to talk with. This could be a sign of depression, but then again who are we to know?   At risk of sounding like some deluded fanboy who thinks he knows what idols are really like (I don't, I promise), this is the thing about Taeyeon that has always made me worried about her whenever news of her haters comes up. She seems emotionally weak to start with; I'm sure a lot of people know the stories of how she ran away from her dorm in her trainee days and SNSD themselves said that Taeyeon barely talked; she's strongly introverted.   Taeyeon gets the most shit from people as the leader of SNSD.   I agree with this as well. But, the news her dating Baekhyun was (I think) just the worst of all the hate by a large margin. Even going through her Instagram during that time was seriously revolting. It wasn't even only k-fans, but international fans as well who were writing comments (in broken English) along the lines of ""kill yourself"", ""ugly whore taking away my oppa"", etc (I'm sorry but how deluded must you be and how much of a sense of reality must you lack to even think of writing comments like those...). Comments about how Taeyeon had lied to them (for the life of me I still just don't understand that argument, and it was one of the biggest things that kept coming up) and everything else were constant. That was easily her lowest time and no human being deserves to go through that kind of abuse. It's disgusting and absolutely, positively unacceptable and ridiculous. It was so painful watching her getting hated on for literally everything she did, especially the scene of her crying at the airport. Having to see her struggle so hard to apologize for living her life and being happy is ludicrous, and even worse was even stronger backlash after this.  I'm incredibly glad she's taking the initiative to fight back. You go, girl."

There's a reason why nothing has been done up until this point, and even then, it's by herself only. I'll give you a hint: it comes straight from the top.  The fact that SM has the gall to put these artists out there to all this abuse, often times without extra security, or even saying something to these fans to tone it down, says a lot on how shitty the company is run as a whole."

Shitting on SM for ""putting their artists out there to all this abuse"" like it was their intention is not a valid argument, it's just blind hate for the company. There's nothing more they can do about the hate comments than what they already are, which is legal action. You can't just suddenly disable SNS accounts since it would garner even more malicious activity towards Taeyeon."

kpop,3dxt7t,brianna_rune_,7,Mon Jul 20 15:55:30 2015 UTC,"That law is there because of how much it factors in the caused of many suicides in Korea.

Seriously after a month when she commited suicide,  suicide in korea increased by 70%!!! And because of malicious comments, her brother and friend Ahn Jae-hwan committed suicide as well.  So in a way, if you dont have anything nice to say, then dont say it at all.  I dont think any of us would enjoy being harassed by others. Plus sometimes the ""truth"" are just opinions. Many people are sensitive to such and cannot handle them.   This is really a start to stop negative outcomes and to bring in/begin to be more positive about things."
kpop,3dxt7t,poopermacho,6,Mon Jul 20 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"As an American, I actually agree with this law. In America, a lot of people do not realize that even under our own laws, threatening is not considered free speech. You can say ""you are ugly"", but you cannot say ""I want to run you over and make you ugly"". It is also illegal to reveal personal information that is none of your business unless it is true evidence of a crime (and only then, unless you are the victim you can only reveal it to the police first and after they announce it, then you can talk). Stalking someone by messaging them on their personal phones is also illegal.   If GamerGate has taught me anything, usually when public figures are harressed, someone will try and threaten them."

You seem part of the latter in this instance.   That may be a noble goal, but the problem is what these statues do is strengthen the rights of the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else, which is a huge problem in South Korea dating back to the military dictatorships.

It could be the translation, I don't know. But I do know that you shouldn't be able to just say hateful things because you're behind a computer screen. There's a point where things cross the line from ""anti fan"" and ""hater"" into whole new territory."

kpop,3dxt7t,sportsteambfan,3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:58 2015 UTC,Can somebody explain to me why its not unusual to sue for things like this? In America it seems like the only time celebs rlly sue is if A) money is involved or lost or B) if intelectual property has been stolen. I honestly cant recall a celeb that I know of taking legal action for nasty internet comments

I agree that you should be able to legally defend yourself against personal threats. However, I do not think you should be able to take legal actions against excessive hate comments. It's a far too subjective matter that leads down a slippery slope of having to define what does and what does not constitute a hate comment. It's entirely open to interpretation."

kpop,3dxt7t,ungut,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I can understand how it can hurt someone, even if they are famous. Reputation is a big thing in entertainment industries and in Korea, it seems to be even more important then America (for instance, I think Ariana Grande will still sell a ton of records after the donut licking thing, but in KPOP I think someone would face a lot more career complications). So having a ton of people hate you for no reason can seem like a real issue. Plus, they also targeted her family and friends.  One of the things I always hate about internet trolls is that everytime someone has an actually issue with a celebrity that could be handled in a simple tweet, it is thrust into the mix of trolling comments, which makes it hard for fans to come to an understand with the celebrity and to become close, which hurts everybody. So that is another reason why I am glad that she will be taking legal action."
kpop,3dxt7t,sinjinnn,3,Mon Jul 20 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"They were attacking her family. Dont you think that should be enough to draw a line? Also fans dont want to read those comments, too. It always hurts me visiting Taeyeons Insta and see cowards calling her names."

kpop,3dxt7t,sinjinnn,13,Mon Jul 20 17:10:59 2015 UTC,Brave talk for someone who hides his identity online. Taeyeon is not anonymous though and thus isnt her family. If haters would know your family and where they live you would think differently.

kpop,3dxt7t,sinjinnn,4,Mon Jul 20 18:23:48 2015 UTC,Because you are not a child? Well thats some childish reasoning. An adult would respond something more thoughtful. You got the brain and the empathy of a steel pin and you are racist for generalizing.

Marionette was kinda...ehhh, because it felt like they were trying so hard to be over the top sexy that is was almost gross. This MV feels like they've acknowledged that and decided they didn't give a fuck. Like they've taken a little more ownership of the concept I guess.  So you want sex, but in-your-face sexy concepts make you uncomfortable? Here, have some vaginas. And blood for good measure  The choreo though... eh I'll wait and see. Honestly their attitudes on stage will make or break it. If they own it, the choreo and the concept, then power to them."
kpop,3dx0du,antiquarked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Honestly the choreo was the most original I've seen from this summer's releases. That rotating square thing where each sang their lines when they faced the camera was just amazing!

Then there's this video, which is so extreme with the imagery. Making sure there are asses and boobs everywhere. Actually, cutting down the frame to focus on purely asses and boobs. And then vulvas everywhere. Vulvas for days and days. And I admit that there is some level of self-awareness and creativity by the director(s). Being very direct about the performance being explicitly and purposefully about sex and objectification and sexy women and vulvas.  Which provides a way for me to accept the MV as a well-considered concept again.  But then there's this wrench in the works that I can't ignore. If this was a Beyonce video, I'd be 100% cool with it, because as far as I know, she exerts artistic control about her own presentation. But it's not Beyonce. I highly doubt this is the brainchild of any of these women. This is their company's choice, their company's song, and the women are wearing the clothing and dancing the choreography and performing in the video in a way that is demanded of them. And THAT makes me fucking uncomfortable. because I can't see how that is anything but pretty serious exploitation.  Man... I dunno. I probably shouldn't be upset about this, but I am. It goes beyond what makes me personally uncomfortable to thinking of the position these women are in... and that's where it gets downright disturbing.  Also because the sex stuff is foreign to me, it just reminds me of being on my period. And that shit ain't fun."

kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,10,Mon Jul 20 07:15:58 2015 UTC,Seriously! Lol. They do a good job with the metaphorical objects and stuff. Not just in this MV. EXID's 'Up & Down' comes to mind as well.  It's cool on its own (even if my brain interprets it as icky)... just bothered me in context with the performance shots of the members.
kpop,3dx0du,TonerKebab,21,Mon Jul 20 07:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'm getting tired of all this depiction of Kpop idols as slaves of their companies.   Regarding schedules, it's true. Some idols (B.A.P come to mind) work/have worked like dogs for their companies for little compensation in return. However, the girls in Stellar are not trafficked sex slaves who are literally forced to whore themselves out for audiences. If you watch Minhee's appearances on that underrated idol star show recently, she oozes confidence and sexuality and seems to revel in it.  It may be hard to imagine as an asexual person but there exist people out there who love to flaunt their sex appeal, the whole ""if you've got it then flaunt it"" kind of deal.   It's cool that you realize that no Kpop video will ever cater to asexual tastes (the industry is based on visuals and sex sells) and have learned to compartmentalize though."
kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,27,Mon Jul 20 07:16:35 2015 UTC,"It may be hard to imagine as an asexual person but there exist people out there who love to flaunt their sex appeal, the whole ""if you've got it then flaunt it"" kind of deal.   This isn't hard for me though. I totally get this. I thought HyunA's 'Red' last year was great. GaIn's stuff is fantastic and I praise her autonomy to take those risks. But have all the members in Stellar, former and current, been totally on board with these concepts? If the current members are truly enthusiastic about doing this, I'd accept it. If it could be guaranteed that they all support this and aren't giving a PR-trained answer, I would have zero qualms about it.  But I've followed Kpop long enough to know how often idols are unhappy with their concepts, feel uncomfortable with them, but have no choice in the matter if they want to continue working. This happens in the huge companies too, but is especially true with the little companies. The structural hierarchy in the system is a real thing, and there is plenty of evidence that kids have been exploited in ways they can't escape from without serious consequences."
kpop,3dx0du,kitchenmaniac111,17,Mon Jul 20 07:29:38 2015 UTC,Gain has little to no autonomy. Even she said earlier this year her concept was picked and had no say and barely understood it.
kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,8,Mon Jul 20 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but she was openly cool about 'Bloom' from what I remember. I think you're referencing 'Paradise Lost', which is a totally fair point.  I'll make a distinction that I don't expect you to accept. It's just what makes the difference for me personally.  If the artist has control of their concept I'm on board with anything, even if it's not aligned with my taste.  If the artist does not have control of their concept, the responsibility is on their handlers to present them in a way that respects the mastery of their performance as a whole. I'm not super fond of the terms 'male gaze' and 'dismemberment', but those are the kinds of things that, for me, do not respect the performance. Close-up shots of cleavage, asses, thighs, bellies, lips... insistently repeated. The camera view is chosen in such a way to guide the viewer over body-parts, where sexualization is implied. Zooming in on breasts with milk dripping down them is a choice made by the director and editors. Those kinds of choices don't represent the individuality of the performer they belong to. They just become disembodied boobs in a sexual context.  Gain's 'Paradise Lost' has only a couple of brief shots of anything like that and they are framed thoughtfully, usually with her face and eyes visible. It might seem like a subtle difference, but this implies to the viewer that the performer is in control of what you are seeing. That it's consented to.   This is not the case with 'Vibrato' where the viewer has no choice but to look at cleavage and thighs and thrusting crotches through a large portion of the video. This reinforces the idea that they have no say in the way they are viewed and consumed. For contrast, I'll note that male idols rarely have these insistent shots of faceless body parts, while it's a common trend for female idols. So it's a purposeful choice being made. I'm fairly certain this is why Gain's videos get praised while other girl groups with sexy concepts don't. The view matters on the impression of the video.  There is a hierarchy of power above these women that make these choices and they know what they're doing... or at least they think they do. If I saw respect for the performer rather than exploitation of their anatomy, I would have no issue.  This is too long. Sorry about that."
kpop,3dx0du,kitchenmaniac111,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Seems pretty subjective really. Personally I like both a lot.

Yura felt strange that the director focused so much on her ass in the skin-colored dress in the music video of Female President.   Yeah, there are examples of idols having to be coerced into concepts but it's quite apparent that Stellar are at least comfortable (if not pursuing) the sexy concepts that they're doing. Idols can be coerced into something for a while but they can't build their entire careers over it unless they have it in themselves to do so. The girls have to face their family and friends at the end of the day after all.  For all you know, the four girls have signed off on the idea that in order to gain fame and success (for them anyway) they have to do it this way.  Hell, for all we speculators know - Stellar is a group of four exhibitionists and they're fucking loving this."
kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,15,Mon Jul 20 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I just wish this wasn't up for speculation either way. I want to know without a doubt that they're cool with this, ya know?"
kpop,3dx0du,inagalaxyfarfaraway,10,Mon Jul 20 07:41:05 2015 UTC,"this interview has been pretty important to me for a while now. Jisook from Rainbow,  Gayoung from Stellar, and Subin from Dal Shabet talk about sexy concepts and how they work with their respective agencies.  (If you want to watch from the start of their interview, it's at 8:36)"
kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what you take away from this interview? (I know tone doesn't translate well online... please understand I'm asking from a place of openness, curiosity, and genuine interest.)  I hugely appreciate you linking this. Thank you. I would like to see more interviews about such things with the idols themselves. Unfortunately, it did very little to comfort me. The main points expressed by the ladies were that:   Doing provocative/sexy concepts are a requirement to get any attention in the industry.   This is fairly obvious, but I wonder if there are other ways to get attention that are more creative and innovative. Orange Caramel gets more positive attention than After School for example. And if the only way for a group to gain attention is by being sexually suggestive to this level, perhaps the system itself needs an overhaul.  The nature of the performance doesn't matter to them. It's purely an opportunity to work hard and become better performers.   I accept this. But again, if hypothetically they were given the option to do a sexy concept like Stellar's or something distinctly different, with the same resulting attention, would they ALL still choose the sexy concept?  It may make family members uncomfortable, but ideally they recognize it as simply a job.   This is upsetting to me. People who care about them are potentially stuck between supporting their loved one's dream and resenting the manner in which they must achieve it.  The headlines criticizing the concepts are making it seem worse than it actually is.   Irrelevant in my view, since I see Korea's sex-negative attitude as a problem. 'Sexy' is fine with me. It's the exploitation within the system that is my concern.    Do you have any insights with any of these? Or got something out of it I missed?"
kpop,3dx0du,Puppysmasher,5,Mon Jul 20 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"You are only viewing Jisook's responses in a negative angle. Here is my take on what she meant by her statements.   Doing sexy concepts to gain traction in the industry is no different than following any other trend. The fact that its sexual makes no difference. She didn't mean this at all. She means that if its a sexy performance, or any performance, the idea is to execute and do the performance well so that it is viewed as a performance. If one is not confident at stage THEN it becomes awkward. By doing a performance, a sexy one well, she hopes people can appreciate the stage as a whole.   Its a job, some people can be mature and professional about it. That is what it means to be mature. Someone models for lingerie, it may make the parent feel a bit uncomfortable but as long as its handled professionally and maturely it is viewed as a respectable job. You can't look at a image of a dance in isolation, its all about the context. The critics are typicality the loudest. On the flip side, if is all so terrible then why is it so popular and proven to show concrete results? Because people do enjoy and appreciate it even if they might not be the most vocal. Look at fan cams and how EXID got their boost. People love EXID now but the big elephant in the room is they owe their career to Kpopfappers watching Hani's fan cam. After that they grew to love the group outside of that fan cam.     The whole exploitation angle really goes back to professionalism and maturity. If I choose to sell a sexy angle am I really going to feel exploited? Does Hani feel exploited? Does an actress doing a sex scene for a movie feel exploited? What about a boy band member told he has to appeal to the fan girls? Appealing to the opposite sex comes with the territory. These girls are not that naive, in fact its probably the detractors thinking they are who are the naive ones.  Context really matters in these things.  If its handled professionally to go for a target audience and everyone understands what the deal is I hardly call it exploitation. Entertainment appeals to a variety of human emotions, sexuality being one of them. There is nothing shameful in that and for the most part its not even that bad in Kpop.   If anything what I got from that interview was how professional these idols are. They understand what a sexy concept is and can go up there and execute and make male fans really feel how sexy they are. They can do the same with a cute concept or any other concept. That is what being a good professional entertainer is. The fact that people take it at face value just proves how good they are at selling their sexy concept.  ""O they are so slutty, she is a whore"" = They totally buy the performance.  ""OMG Oppa is so cute and the perfect nice guy!"" = They totally buy the performance."
kpop,3dx0du,alleybetwixt,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"I think we're responding to different things.  My concerns are about the position and choice of individual Kpop idols within their companies. The pressures, the risks, the demands. About how their subordinate status can make it nearly impossible to express discomfort with how they are presented to the public.   If I choose to sell a sexy angle am I really going to feel exploited?   If you've made the active choice to do so, chose the nature of the 'sexy angle', and were not pressured by outside forces to do something you otherwise wouldn't... you probably won't feel exploited. Do you think that idols have the power to manage their own image this way?   Does Hani feel exploited? Does an actress doing a sex scene for a movie feel exploited?   Hani might? I don't know how she truly feels about it. And there are cases where actresses felt exploited by a job they felt they were coerced to do... or were not managed in a respectful way. Doesn't just have to be a sex scene. This article was circulating recently. It's something that happens. I'm not saying it's common. It happens. I mentioned Jang Ja-yeon in different discussion. Sometimes things are happening behind the scenes that none of us know about.  Naivety has nothing to do with it. The smartest, strongest, most confident person can still be stuck between a rock and a hard place and struggle with the choices they are pressured to make.  At most, we can take from this interview the opinions of three idols. What about the idols who left their companies because they were unhappy with their concepts, or dealt with incredible pressure to diet, or change their faces, or perform a certain way, or sued because their contracts were being exploited beyond the legal standards, or their health needs and injuries were ignored? Does Jisook speak for all of them?  My concern is for the reality we don't see. Behind closed doors. That we are never aware of unless an artist speaks candidly and un-scripted about it, which is extremely rare, and usually only happens after a bunch of damage has been done.  I don't have an innate problem with any kind of performance, whether sexy or cute or creepy. I only care about choice and whether they truly feel they have one, either way."
kpop,3dx0du,Puppysmasher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:22 2015 UTC,"What about the idols who left their companies because they were unhappy with their concepts, or dealt with incredible pressure to diet, or change their faces, or perform a certain way, or sued because their contracts were being exploited beyond the legal standards, or their health needs and injuries were ignored? Does Jisook speak for all of them?   It is a job, people do things they don't like at their jobs everyday. This whole idea that they are exploited just because they may not like certain aspects of it is ridiculous. Kpop isn't exactly like western pop music in that the artists are more like employees and representatives of a group brand to a company. If you don't like what the job entails you quit just like any other person and find a different agency that caters more to your needs. Sometimes it gets nasty with legal and sometimes its over unfair working conditions. Surprise, it happens everywhere everyday in the adult world.   People sign on to be an idol first and that entails sexy concepts, diets, and catered performances just like most other entertainment jobs. Just like if actor/actress doesn't want to do a kissing/sex scene or doesn't want to watch their figure then guess what, that is going to severely limit their work and there really isn't anything unfair about it. If an ""idol"" only wants to sing and not do all the other visual stuff and aegyo then you try out for a different company than one pushing a standard girl group. I mean lets be real here, a lot of the girls in Kpop are not hired for their singing ability and they know it.    I only care about choice and whether they truly feel they have one, either way.   I feel like often this topic makes allusions to sex trafficking which it is not even remotely close. People do jobs they hate to make living every single day. Sometimes a career choice turns out not the way they envision and they leave. The choice is always there to walk away if it is something you are truly uncomfortable with or despise. Can that mess up your career or damage your livelihood? Of course, but its a case of putting your money where your mouth is, and if you are getting sexually harassed then for damn sure you should walk regardless.   Nobody is entitled to be a celebrity and have a company bend over to cater to them, that is not how it works at all. The choice is always there to strike out on their own, compose their own music and do what they want like Sera of 9muses. Its always easy to bash a company for pushing a sexy concept that sells when they aren't paying the bills. The entertainment industry is a harsh and cruel one to survive in and behind the smiles I am pretty sure the idols know what they have to put in to possible make it. Others may not be cut out for it, and that is just how the cookie crumbles.   As a last note, with all this said there are some questionable and unfair labor practices in Korea IMO in regards to pay and working hours but my main point is that this pity parade about sexy concepts and these ""poor"" girls is pretty patronizing. They are smarter and braver than the average person to have the drive to stick it through thick and thin to make it. They know what they are potentially in for and are probably a lot more mentally prepared, hardly some poor girl being manhandled by the evil company to shake their butts or expose themselves. One would have to be blind to not to see what being a Kpop idol can entail and Jisook's interview shows they are not all oblivious to this."
kpop,3dx0du,TonerKebab,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:34:40 2015 UTC,You aren't going to get that confirmation from them or any group because most Kpop fans don't overthink this sort of thing or need validation that idols are okay with what they're performing.

Stellar is pretty much the only group to take it this far, and they do it knowing full well it blows any chance of them winning mainstream recognition (remember music shows deduct 75% or something if the MV is rated 19).  That said, I love Stellar, they're easily one of my top 5 favorite groups! People just kind of get hung up on their MVs and ignore the actual songs."

It calls into question the sort of role sex plays in the proliferation of kpop, and whether too much of it is a concern.  Of course, this is /r/kpop we're talking about. A good quarter of the male fans in here are only fans because it fulfills their Asian girl fetish, and don't want any sort of supposed 'SJW's' to ruin the fun.

Or if you know in advance that certain rote lines of thought are going to crop up and run a discussion aground before it gets to the place you want to, you can try to pre-empt that by addressing those talking points before they get thrown into the ring.  Shitting on people OTOH is just liable to make them defensive, and even people who are comfortable with a little attitude in writing will at least suspect you may be more about ranting than interested in genuine discussion.  Here's the skinny on the above: Engaging in debate requires some level of agility and adaptability. Lamenting an uneven playing field gets you nowhere. Instead think about how you can deal with arguments and change minds. The one requirement for that is really making up your mind beforehand whether you care about changing minds, or just desire confirmation.  /lifeadvice"

kpop,3dx0du,falsabaiana,4,Mon Jul 20 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"Stellar.. I'm a fan but this song doesn't do it for me.. it just sounds so messy and I can't catch any nice hook. The sexual imagery (the handbag zomg) is getting a little predicable. I want to like it but it just strikes me as desperate. The past three title songs have all been so great..why, Stellar, why!"
kpop,3dx0du,imperfectofcourse,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"It's funny how opinions in music differ so much. IMO this song is one of the best kpop songs I have heard this year. The production is top notch, the vocals were perfect and mixed well with the progression of the song. That tempo change towards the end of the song was both bold and unpredictable and yet added so much to the song. Ignore the video for what it is, this is an incredible song that should solidify Stellar's future."
kpop,3dx0du,vaultofechoes,3,Mon Jul 20 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"this is an incredible song that should solidify Stellar's future.   You're right on both accounts, this is an incredible song, and it will solidify Stellar's future as a second tier group who has all but given up on mainstream success.   Their extremely mature MV concepts cut off most of the points they could get on music shows, so they'll never win anything even with better release timing -- but that doesn't seem to phase them. They honestly seem to enjoy their smaller scale concerts, and I enjoy watching their fancams too!"

kpop,3dx0du,T-rollypoly,2,Mon Jul 20 08:27:50 2015 UTC,"Damn. I guess this is the return of full-on-sexy-Marionette-Stellar. Like Marionette and most of their other songs, this song was great. Could have easily been a title track for a top tier girl group (better than most title tracks these days actually). I also think they did a really good job of giving the non-Minhee members a chance in the spotlight."
kpop,3dx0du,Dwesk,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:33 2015 UTC,"I like it tons more than Marionette, that's for sure. The whole ""damn the haters, we're just going to own the sexy concept now"" instead of apologizing any more more feels bold and fun, and made me grin. The song itself is solid enough to carry the attempt, too. Even more Digipedi innuendo would've been great."

First they appear with a sexy concept that makes people outrageous, then they make an unneeded song/mv that was Fool, which only purpose was as a stupid response against the the netizen hate and now 4 months pass and they're back with a sexy as hell MV again and get hate again. WHAT THE FUCK WAS EVEN THE POINT OF MAKING ""FOOL""? Kpop is so fucking backwards sometimes, I can't even comprehend how stupid some of the people working in the media are."
kpop,3dx0du,highdefw,6,Mon Jul 20 06:19:52 2015 UTC,"I think the point of ""Fool"" was not only to respond to the netizen hate, but also to inform netizens that Stellar will do whatever concept they like, regardless of what some nobodies on the internet think. Hence this new release."

Is there a point when doing this 'sexy concept' becomes too much? I'm okay with it because, yes, it is an art form and yes, these idols are knowing what they are doing, but, at the same time, so many other girl-groups do the same thing.  Granted, Stellar definitely takes the 'sexy concept' to a whole new level, but still, the 'sexy concept' has its place, but when so many other groups take the route of being overly sexy and just trying to keep on pace with other girl-groups, it becomes stale, predictable and unoriginal. I'd rather see something a bit more uplifting or classy or motivational. I'm okay with the sexy concept, but when it's been done so many times, it becomes over saturated and boring in my opinion. Sorry to those who disagree. ^"

kpop,3dylhr,effhomer,7,Mon Jul 20 19:13:49 2015 UTC,These translations always sound awkward. I'd like to hear a song written in Japanese by them though.
kpop,3dylhr,Equilibriumx,9,Mon Jul 20 22:26:16 2015 UTC,"This is why they sound awkward.  It's just more or less literally translated.  We can take EXO for an example, their Chinese versions sound so good because they actually are written in Chinese properly, not word-by-word translated.  Overdose was written in Chinese first and translated to Korean IIRC"
kpop,3dylhr,5thEagle,3,Mon Jul 20 23:23:24 2015 UTC,Suddenly I now know why the Chinese version of Overdose just sounds more aurally fitting than the Korean version.
kpop,3dylhr,5thEagle,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Kind of like what they did with Chanmi's short spoken sentence. Very j-pop sounding. Also like the ""shoushi (sp?), show me"" in Hyejeong's. Everyone else's parts sound like garbage for the most part since you're trying to fit syllables into beats that just don't exist.  Pretty sure Yuna's Japanese is actually natural sounding and that her part doesn't just make it easier to actually pronounce. I think. Seolhyun's pronunciation isn't bad either.  They also somehow managed to master the audio even worse than the Korean MV entirely separate of the language  issue. Like... how? Compression city."
kpop,3dylhr,Saya_,2,Tue Jul 21 10:09:14 2015 UTC,So it wasn't just me? I was having real difficulty hearing anything to be honest. Only a few words here and there but otherwise it kind of sounded mushed into the instrumentals.
kpop,3dylhr,5thEagle,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:49 2015 UTC,Yes. It's compressed to hell and somehow managed to lump in the vocals with the instrumentals. It was already awful in the Korean MV; somehow it's now worse.

I'm not sure all the styling is showing him in the best light, but it's cool he got to go totally wild with his swan song before enlistment.

Looks like everyone's really having fun. Love that he got all his staff with him. The unnies looking great as usual. Feels like the music video was trying to do too much imo, but the story was told well at least.  The song is pretty good imo, but I'm a sucker for songs built on that 80's guitar. This was interesting; I heard influences from Motown, 80's rock, late 90's pop, and shades of Michael Jackson."

kpop,3dxiq9,RoninGaijin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"Just for grins and giggles...  I was mostly negative about English in Kpop (neutral when used correctly but disliking most examples given)... It's not always bad... it just usually is.  First comment box (specific example): This is so picky, but T-ara N4's pronunciation of ""why"" drives me nuts in Jeon Won Diary.  It sounds like ""wah wah wah wah wah"".  It's such a short word but really requires some nuance in pronunciation.  Second: I think completeness of expression is required to give using English any value.  You can't just throw in words here and there... nonsense or filler.  If you're not expressing a complete idea... or at least a full sentence, it is best avoided (from my perspective).  It almost always sounds like they (the artists) are trying to sound cool to Koreans, rather than appeal to international fans.  That isn't wrong, but you asked my opinion.  I don't mind some English in Kpop. It is when it distracts from the song (whether through incorrectness or silliness) that it becomes detrimental.  This just happens to usually be the case."
kpop,3dxiq9,pbdonut,13,Mon Jul 20 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"But they're not saying ""why"" in English. They're saying it in Korean, which is ""wae""."

kpop,3dxiq9,pbdonut,5,Mon Jul 20 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"Other than the messy structure with English words randomly thrown into parts of the song and ""punkadelic crazy night"", it's okay. The examples OP provides in the survey are much worse and not to mention that there are a lot more songs in which the English is so bad that it's a whole new dialect that only the writers of the songs could understand."
kpop,3dxiq9,qquestionmark,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"English words randomly thrown into parts of the song   It's all over the song. Money, flash, satellite, suite room, bad boy bad girl, style, mama, search light, etc. On top of that there's the ""hide and seek no every night"" line, and the abundant use of ""boom boom boom"". All in all it ruins the song for me. Not nearly okay in my book."
kpop,3dz8vb,arch2,31,Mon Jul 20 19:02:11 2015 UTC,Notes about this nomination list that is WTF:   Siwon of Super Junior has a nomination for Best Male Artist. He has not even released solo music.  Song Ji-hyo only had featured status on the Kenji Wu song. Busker Busker is listed but they haven't released new material in a while.   The Junho listed in Best Male Artist is the 2PM member.

kpop,3dz8vb,hubwub,5,Mon Jul 20 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, that one makes sense. I knew of that. That's why it was not bullet pointed, but in OP's table they did not have which group the person was in."

There's also a few words that so could have been altered for the better by similar sounding words. ""Feel so what"" could be ""Feel so hot"", or even ""taut"" if they didn't want to be TOO suggestive. ""Baby don't you leave my mine"" - I really hope that's misspelling for mind by 1theK, because I cannot.      Saying all this, it's quite catchy and I'm OK with being ignorant to the lyrics."

No.  I'm not going to bother explaining the meaning behind their names, but Sonamoo is simply the romanization of 소나무, which translates as ""Pine Tree"".  Whereas Mamamoo is the combination of the word ""Mama"" and the first syllable of ""Music"" in Korean.  In Fiestar's case, their name is derived from the Spanish word ""Fiesta"".

kpop,3dwik7,daesie,4,Mon Jul 20 05:02:04 2015 UTC,"Mamamoo debuted first in June of last year and Sonamoo in December. I don't think Mamamoo means anything in Korean (or maybe it does???) but Sonamoo means 'pine tree' in Korean so I don't think their company was really trying to copy them or anything (but srly who knows w/ TS ugh). Besides, idol groups are prepared months/years in advance so it can't really be helped if they had already settled on a name but didn't debut soon enough but idk"
kpop,3dwik7,anonova,3,Mon Jul 20 05:18:44 2015 UTC,"""MAMAMOO"" is indeed just jibberish.   What does your group name mean?  Solar: MAMAMOO is baby talk. We named ourselves ""MAMAMOO"", which is similar to what newborns instinctively say, because we wanted to approach the global audiences with our music in [an] instinctive way, like how babies speak instinctively.  Moonbyul: ""Mama"" is a universal word. That's why we included it in our group name, too."

It's been a long time since I've greeted you all.  News of Wonder Girls' comeback has been getting a lot attention recently and many people are wondering about my future as well.  I once again realized that still, a lot of you continue to pay attention to me and give me lots of love, and I am so grateful  At this point, with so much interest, I thought it would be the respectful idea to personally let you all know with a message.  From today forward, I will be ending my activities as a member of 'Wonder Girls'  I thought about this a lot by myself, and I talked with the members a lot too.  But I'm still lacking skills to call myself an actress right now.  People may be quick to judge my greed for being both a singer and actress while in 'Wonder Girls'.  From now on I will also be a 'Wonder Girls' fan and cheer for them with all my heart.  But the fans who loved me so much will be the happiest memories of my life, I am very sorry that we couldn't see 'Wonder Girls' to the end together.  In the future I hope to show everyone a good performance as the actress An Sohee, and not disappoint your expectations.  Thank You."
kpop,3dwrlj,vosdka,23,Mon Jul 20 04:58:23 2015 UTC,This is one of the most thoughtful letters I've seen from an idol to their fans.  Good luck out there Sohee!
kpop,3dwrlj,brianna_rune_,69,Mon Jul 20 09:37:51 2015 UTC,Wow! This has been the least drama-ridden withdrawal from a band that I have seen in a LONG time. Other companies (including Western ones) could really learn from them!
kpop,3dwrlj,SNSDave,32,Mon Jul 20 05:16:39 2015 UTC,"It also helped that Sohee left the company a while back, and that Sunye had rumors about her for months too. It was expected."
kpop,3dwrlj,brianna_rune_,16,Mon Jul 20 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"That is true, but if I remember correctly, Kris from EXO had rumors that he was leaving EXO for awhile but when it was official SM still treated it like a weird, Game Of Thrones style war and would not just let things end (they are still having legal issues with it). To this day, I still hope that all of the over exaggerating that EXO did was put upon them by SM."
kpop,3dwrlj,iam-curious,9,Mon Jul 20 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Probably because, he withdraw form the group on their peak. And that will be a huge blow to the company if not handled well; not that it was handled with any care but yeah."
kpop,3dwrlj,JoyfulBanana,7,Mon Jul 20 10:00:15 2015 UTC,If anything it's the kpop groups that make the huge deal and not the west
kpop,3dwrlj,brianna_rune_,6,Mon Jul 20 06:01:11 2015 UTC,"In terms of letting things end gracefully and having acceptable legal practices, it's a half and half. But in terms of treating it like a big issue, I think that KPOP companies may do a bit more because they spend a lot of time and money on training , and unlike with American companies (in which no one really cares about the company name), KPOP companies are supposed to be seen as a strong group. Still , that is no excuse for making something small (because in reality, singing is just another job) into a gigantic issue or (something I have seen other companies do), try and manipulate young fans' emotions to be on their side since they know the fans are not focused on more important life events.   Still, JYP is ahead of the curve on both ends since it seems like they won't have to deal with any of that petty court date nonsense."

Hello always kind and grateful Wonderfuls!  Today this will probably be the last piece of writing I leave as a member of the Wonder Girls..^  Over the past 8 years, looking back at the road I walked together with all of you, I will forever be thankful.  How can I say each of them one by one... I will frequently look back to all of the memories that we made together over in that time.  When I look back to the memories of our time together, the amount of grace and love I recieved, I could never repay.  The love and kindness that you gave me, I can never repay you all for that.  Once again, I am very grateful, and thank you.  I have a lot of things I want to say.  There are many things you may want to ask.  Right now those stories cannot all be released..  The last thing I definitely want to say is thank you for everything you've all done for me...  I ask you all to look forward to and support the stories!  I would like to apologize and say I'm sorry once again for not being able to take full responsibility as the leader in the past, and for always showing myself as lacking something!  The things that I was able to experience with the Wonder Girls' members and all of you was valuable, a journey that made me realize just how precious it was.  In the future, as the mother of a child, I will continue to strive to live a life where I do my best.  From now on you all will not be able to see me as a part of the Wonder Girls..  In the future at a good time I would like to show you all a good image of me^  To all of the always thoughtful, not thoughtless, perservering Wonderfuls.  I ask all of you to give each of the Wonder Girls your sincere support and appreciation and to respect their decisions, both now and in the future.  And I would like to convey my gratitude once again.  Thank you Wonderfuls!  -Sunye"

kpop,3dwrlj,rainytofu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's about time that Sunye officially withdrawn from WG. She's the one who held the group back from making a comeback until now. The group could've had a five member comeback before Sohee left JYPE just as a send off. But no, she had to say that she was taking a two year break. Everyone knew it wasn't true. I understand her wanting to hold onto the group but she held them back so much for being selfish.   Sohee's letter was sincere. She really does love her fans and her fans know that her passion has never been as an idol. She's always wanted to become an actress so good for her. I hope she will make an appearance every once in a while on stage.  I can't wait until the other four make their comeback. They deserve it after this long. And good riddance that Sunye is gone. She has really ruined her fans' opinion of her by holding the group back for so long. BTW, Sunmi's teaser was great."
kpop,3dwrlj,mmemmetee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"May I ask how she held the group back? I know she signed the contract to continue, but I don't see anything actually stopping the rest of the girls do something, anything. As far as I'm aware only one did a solo album, the rest could have done a sub-unit, acting activities etc etc. And I'm pretty sure if the girls wanted to do a comeback as wondergirls, Sunye wouldn't have physically stopped them as she was on her break, and Sohee was on hers. They're all friends, they would have been fine, as they are now.   I don't know maybe I just don't think Sunye was that selfish unless the strictly told them ""Do not do anything without me as a group"", she just simply signed the contract to still be able to be part of the group and make her return easily if she had so wished."
kpop,3dwrlj,DwwwD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"Just like when Sunmi left the group, the group couldn't go on without all five members. That's how Lim was put into the group. The group itself wasn't popular enough without five members. Sunmi didn't make her solo comeback yet. So with just four members, JYPE didn't have any plans for WG to have a comeback. Wonder Girls was also a group that was made for Sunye in order to debut her. She's always been JYP's favorite. When she took her break, the group essentially went on break. Now that Sunmi is popular on her own as a solo, the group finally has enough to come back as four and not have to rely on a five member formation. JYPE also lost Sohee because they never allowed her to act outside of music videos. She's always wanted to do acting ever since she did her first movie. But she never got her chances outside being the lead in music videos and a guest appearance on a comedy. If JYPE didn't plan any projects for the rest of the members, they would be leaving too. That's how Yeeun/Yenny got her solo and why the group is even making a comeback. I heard that their Yubin and Yeeun's new contracts are only for two years anyway.  There are some people who say worse things about Sunye. I didn't have an opinion about her until now. She got married before her contract was over. She gave birth before resigning her contract. She essentially resigned with JYPE knowing that she was going to be gone for a few years. Then she announces that she's going to move to Haiti to spread God's word for at least two years. I mean, why bother resigning a contract if you have no intention to be around for at least 5 years? If you're going to be gone for at least 5 years, it might as well be better if you just didn't resign the contract. There's no telling if the group would stay with that company for that long. I think Sunye is selfish because even if she didn't state that the group couldn't have a comeback without her, it was implied. It was clear from day one that Sunye had no intention to come back after she got pregnant. That's why it shocked everyone when she resigned with JYPE."

As I understand it, once a composition is recorded, anyone can then record their own version (a cover version) without specifically asking permission, but then they have to pay the composer set rates established by statute.  They can also negotiate different rates if they want, but if they do not, they have to pay the set rates."
kpop,3dwzhh,falsabaiana,52,Mon Jul 20 05:53:34 2015 UTC,Drowning in a foreign land? I wonder what that could mean.
kpop,3dwzhh,herere,22,Mon Jul 20 06:25:37 2015 UTC,Damn who is supporting/managing his comeback? His daddy? I take back what I said about shitty cgi lol. I hope the mv and song are in good quality.
kpop,3dwzhh,nnworb,18,Mon Jul 20 07:19:30 2015 UTC,I guess this needs a C-Pop tag?   Anyway- Pathcode Tao and stuff. Symbolism!
kpop,3dwzhh,Uanaka,12,Mon Jul 20 05:55:49 2015 UTC,"I believe it's M-Pop! Mando pop, otherwise C-Pop can be mistaken for canto-pop."
kpop,3dwzhh,djswims,-5,Mon Jul 20 11:59:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it needs a C-Pop tag, more so that it belongs in the C-Pop subreddit."
kpop,3dwzhh,herere,15,Mon Jul 20 05:58:24 2015 UTC,He's not legally out of Exo yet.
kpop,3dwzhh,SWOW,2,Mon Jul 20 06:21:06 2015 UTC,Maybe not but this solo debut of his has nothing to do with exo or kpop.
kpop,3dwzhh,BrigidAndair,28,Mon Jul 20 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"It does in the same way that CL's American debut, Kris and Luhan's status as of late, or any of EXO-M's MVs did in the past. Tao is a part of kpop, no matter what he's doing now, by virtue of being a continuing interest to the kpop community.  Otherwise, nothing that wasn't a Korean language song (I.e news, images, extra videos, especially those of retired/inactive artists) would be posted, being not technically kpop. For sure, it's appropriate for /r/cpop too, but Tao's activities are also of a vested interest to kpop fans."
kpop,3dwzhh,djswims,4,Mon Jul 20 12:32:01 2015 UTC,"CL is still a member of a K-Pop group, so her activities are often found as an interest to K-Pop fans.  Kris and Luhan are gone, and for that they are not under anything K-Pop. Unless they release a Korean track or appear on a Korean variety show, they do not belong in this thread.  Tao may not have legally left yet, but he has made it pretty clear he does not associate with EXO anymore. Aside from the paperwork, he essentially is not in EXO. As such, this should go into the M-Pop* subreddit because it isn't in Korean and he isn't with a K-Pop group.   It's the exact same reason why Jessica's recent Blanc & Eclair photo shoots and films aren't going on this thread, it's simply not K-Pop news."
kpop,3dwzhh,herere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"Luhan and Kris are still posted here without drama. Like Chad Future, if you don't like it just hide it. Lastly, /r/mpop doesn't exist. It should go in /r/cpop which is almost dead and nobody has posted this yet."
kpop,3dwzhh,BrigidAndair,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"As per your logic on CL, I'd still argue that Tao is of interest to kpop fans whether he's still in EXO or not and thus should be here, but ultimately it's up to the mods.  If they think it's relevant enough to be here, then it should be fine."
kpop,3dwzhh,PizzaEatingPanda,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:27 2015 UTC,This has been debated many times but this thread should be okay because it already has had prior precedence for years on /r/kpop from similar acts.

kpop,3dwzhh,Teamshadenfreude,8,Mon Jul 20 08:03:50 2015 UTC,This is like pathcode teasers + inception.
kpop,3dwzhh,ehwhythough,5,Mon Jul 20 07:49:05 2015 UTC,"He posted last year/early this year on his weibo ""I can't wait to show you my lyrics/songs"". Fans thought he meant he'll write lyrics for EXO's comeback but it's obvious now he meant he'll be leaving EXO and releasing his own album. Gives me goosebumps to know that he has planned this all a long and has been pretending he won't leave all those months prior to his dad dropping the weibo post."
kpop,3dwzhh,BrigidAndair,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"I sincerely doubt that he would have purposefully alluded to his withdrawal from the group, especially with all of the hate that Kris and Luhan have gotten.  He would have known that a lot of those fans would have been so devastated/angry at his leaving, that getting their hopes up like this would have been downright cruel, and I don't think he'd have done that.  I think that it's much more likely that he was working on either stuff for EXO or for release through a social media outlet than him having planned this all along.  Even if he had intended that far out to withdraw from EXO, announcing that through social media would have been about the stupidest thing he could have done, for precisely this reasoning."
kpop,3dwzhh,MyNameIsJordan,5,Mon Jul 20 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"I was initially a little worried as to the drop in quality Tao's solo would be from his stuff with EXO, since EXO is managed by SM and Z. Tao is managed by his new baby agency.  But this looks good so far"
kpop,3dwzhh,alleybetwixt,5,Mon Jul 20 06:20:12 2015 UTC,"So, um... what's his actual status in SM? Is SM supporting this or is he in similar limbo with Kris/Luhan and doing this on his own with separate support from China?  Edit: Just hoping to find information and thought EXO fans might know. Last I saw his father got involved with negotiating the future of his contract, so I'm a bit lost and wondering where this teaser (which looks great) is coming from?"

I don't mean to offend anyone by pushing out of this sub those artists that obviously started out in Korea but have since migrated back to China. But we clearly have a sub that is better suited for (Mandarin-) Chinese music that is produced in China by Chinese people. Why doesn't anyone at least consider posting over there. I know /r/cpop isn't as fancy schmancy as /r/kpop - not with that attitude, anyhow."

Why does she keep getting songs and MV and get marketed so aggressively?    the hair doesn't suit her, the american apparel shorts aren't fitted well (coordi!!) its like aegyo sexy which is my pet peeve as it doesn't appeal to anyone. she had really weird teeth which Jpop loves so I thought she was trying to go that route so I have no idea who she's marketed toward."

That shit just doesn't do it for me, not unless you have some god tier vocalist. Either way, this song blows a lot of her previous work out of the water. Even if you don't think it is number one, it is a lot better than most of her previous work."
kpop,3dwikh,toThe9thPower,7,Mon Jul 20 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Dumb songs like I'm Different and Coming Soon had their charm in being simplistic and silly.

kpop,3dwuos,kitaab123,15,Mon Jul 20 04:58:56 2015 UTC,"BEST HOMIN ALBUM TO DATE.   Every song has their own unique sound and feel to them, it's hard to pick a favorite.  Two year wait for this world tour? Definitely gonna be worth it.    Song Reviews      Vertigo - Definitely a good intro to the album! Yes, Homin, we have been waiting for you like mad! I'm loving the smooth yet... powerful feel. They demand to be heard, and Vertigo gives that vibe.   Champagne (U-Know/Yunho Solo) - There are no words for how I feel about this song. If I had a car, I would be blasting this while driving through Seattle on a Friday or Saturday night with my friends. This is just one of those songs that you can't help but love love loooooooove. Rise As One (Max/Changmin Solo) - When the world tour for this album happens in two years, this will probably be the song they play right in the middle of the concert to get the crowd hype, or a montage video. The beat is great, definitely sounds like something I would hear at an outdoor concert. To be honest, it took me a couple times to get into this song. Everyday It Rains - Ooooh, time to slow it down. This is a good cool down song from the previous tracks, but it still keeps me interested. I'm liking the keyboard jazzy feels, along with the sounds of rain and a storm playing in the background. Not my favorite off the album, but still a goodie. Smile - I WILL DEFINITELY SMILE FOR YOU CHANGMIN. MY FAVORITE SONG OFF THE ENTIRE ALBUM. Honestly, this song is nothing but sunshine in the summertime, strolling down the sidewalk without a care in the world. I would marry this song if I could.  Top of the World - The beginning of this song gives me straight up Michael Jackson feels. The base, the piano, then the gradual electronic sounds added in, gold. When the chorus rolls in, it's nothing but perfection. Definitely my second favorite song in the album.  Apology (Max/Changmin Solo) - Boy, Changmin is really feeling those RnB beats. I can imagine Usher or Ray J definitely using this beat back in the early 2000s, like, that's how damn RnB this song is. Honestly, if this song wasn't about asking for forgiveness and all, I think it would be another Heaven's Day. As long as you take off your shirt when you perform this song, I accept your apology, Changmin. Komplikated (U-Know/Yunho Solo) - AYEEEEE~ BUST OUT THE LIGHTSTICKS. Want me to be honest? I imagine that this song would be maaaaad popular if it was played in gay clubs. The song has that Europop feel that you can't help but move your body along to. I would love Yunho to make a straight up dance album now. Give me that synthpop beat and the bass, and I'm sold. Dominus - Now, if you are looking for a track that guarantees you that SM produced it, this is the song. It has the guitar, the orchestra, that slow beat that transitions into that pop beat, the breakdown in the middle, yup. I feel that this song could have been thrown onto 'Catch Me,' or maybe even the 'Spellbound' album, but it just didn't fit the futuristic and jazz genre they were going for. Lucky Star - Give me the rock guitars and the strong vocals! Time to end the album on a high note. My lucky stars are headed off into the Army to become proper soldiers, and I'm so proud of how far they have come. These last nine years that I have spent with them have been amazing, and though it's heartbreaking to see them off, this song reminds me that they will always be there, and that they will be coming back."

The whole album just sounds so nice and well-produced, especially compared to their last couple releases. It feels like almost everyone from SM has put out really solid albums this year.

This is what Maroon 5 would be if they weren't so boring. Waiting  for the mv - I like this more than Vertigo. I'm getting flashbacks to when I marathoned That Girl on a rainy day. Elevator music. That Yunho drop at 2:50. Another Changmin solo? This sounds like an American OST. Yunho! That spelling. I love the house sound, but 0:50 sounds off. It would be my favorite if that part wasn't like that. I love 2:30. When it turns rock it sounds like another recent Korean song."
kpop,3dwuos,herere,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:10 2015 UTC,No way! Im so disappointed with Rise as one i was expecting something like the teaser :S
kpop,3dwuos,HornyYordle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:22:07 2015 UTC,They aren't promoting any singles right?
kpop,3dwuos,sunshibe,3,Mon Jul 20 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"With Yunho heading into the Army sometime tomorrow, unfortunately there won't be any promotions."
kpop,3dwuos,BlueAlmond,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:19 2015 UTC,Will Changmin promote his solo at all?
kpop,3dwuos,Teamshadenfreude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think this album will be promoted at all. With the announcement of this only being a week or so ago, I think this was more so a goodbye gift from Yunho and Changmin because of their upcoming two year hiatus (and a money maker for SM with the Black/White albums).  Changmin just finished up promoting the drama ""Scholar Who Walks the Night,"" so I'm fairly sure that if there was to be promotions for the album it would have started weeks ago. I am unsure if he has any other projects planned up until his enlistment in November."
kpop,3dwuos,BlueAlmond,2,Mon Jul 20 08:03:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, 2 year hiatus. Any dates on when the both of them will be done with the army? So YH enlisting now and CM a few months after, lol, why couldn't they enlist at the same time. JJ is currently in the army too. This is the first time I'm hearing about this and it hurts my heart. Being disbanded was one thing, but no more music from either HoMin or JYJ leaves a kind of inexplicable emptiness and is somewhat terrifying, granted neither group has ended just yet. Still, hiatuses bug me. SE7EN had a huge hiatus followed by a short comeback and then ""bye kpop world"". Suppose it's all so inevitable."
kpop,3dwuos,bluntwrapper,3,Mon Jul 20 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"Changmin had actually applied to be enlisted in the Ancillary Police unit so he would be released from military duties not too long after Yunho would be discharged from the Army. Though it would be nice if both of them went in and trained at the same time, I'm sure it is a bit frowned upon.    Knowing JYJ, as they each get discharged and finish their military duties, they will probably continue with their solo activities until they all collectively finish their services, then continue with group projects together. Even though there is a hiatus of JYJ being together as three, JYJ Membership Week is still going on this year! The trailer video was released last night both in Korean and Japanese. SM, being the powerhouse of a company that they are, already had TVXQ extend their contract before enlisting, so a comeback from the two of them is guaranteed.    As a Cassiopeia of nine years, I absolutely feel your pain. Knowing that all of them were going to leave eventually, it was, and still is heartbreaking, but you kinda have to go with the thought that all of them are doing their duty for South Korea. We should be proud of what they are going to accomplish, and they are going to be proper soldiers. Being an OT5, I'm hoping one day that JYJ and Homin pull a Shinhwa and come back together, but I'm not going to hold my breath.     Jaejoong : March 31st, 2015 -  December 30th, 2016  Yoochun : August 27th, 2015 - August 26th, 2017    Junsu : Probably enlisting in January or February 2016.  Yunho : July 21st, 2015 -   April 20th, 2017  Changmin : November 19th, 2015 - August 18th, 2017"
kpop,3dwuos,BlueAlmond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:18 2015 UTC,"Haha I noticed like yesterday on youtube that Shinhwa had a new song. :) What's OT5? Oh man, my 10 year is coming up, since Aug 2005. I wish I had supported them more back then by buying more stuff but it's hard when you're in high school... Very nice to see other long term fans around! :)  edit: Nothing against their army duties. I was just thinking that someday they'll have to retire...and then we won't get to hear their voices anymore."
kpop,3dwuos,bluntwrapper,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"OT5 - One true five (a play off of OTP - one true pairing).   I know how you feel! 2006 was my freshman year in high school, and I was transitioning from J-Pop to K-Pop. Yay for other long term fans!    Oh, of course! I understand that they will all retire one day... but I hope that won't be for a long long time. :D"
kpop,3dwuos,BlueAlmond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:04 2015 UTC,He's going to perform it at S.M. concerts.
kpop,3dwjq5,theangrycamel,19,Mon Jul 20 03:10:32 2015 UTC,The Japanese sounds so stretched and sped randomly to match the Korean and it just feels really uncomfortable. And audiowise the mastering makes it sound like a cover versus a translated one. But I don't know Japanese so it may just be me.
kpop,3dwjq5,djswims,4,Mon Jul 20 03:17:44 2015 UTC,Nah not just you. Kor > Jap and vice versa tends to sound strange for a lot of the songs I've heard. Like A Cat's chorus was worse than this
kpop,3dwjq5,ekoh8873,8,Mon Jul 20 03:29:30 2015 UTC,"SNSD is the only group i've heard do it really, really well. Hoot is one of my favourites in both languages."
kpop,3dwjq5,latebaroque,7,Mon Jul 20 08:31:11 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer Oh! in japanese. The majority of SNSD's translated songs sound just as good as the original. I personally find that Genie has less power in japanese than in korean, though it's still solid."
kpop,3dwjq5,steamedcat,3,Mon Jul 20 10:18:20 2015 UTC,When they come up with the Japanese lyrics they don't get the exact same amount of syllables so that's why it can sound so awkward. You're sort of expecting the timing of the Korean version :)
kpop,3dwjq5,LordNero,3,Mon Jul 20 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"For me it's that, plus the existence of English loan words in their songs. I understand it's a part of the Japanese language that they have a fair amount of English loan words (definitely more than in Korean), however it throws me off-guard when I hear it in a song.   Hell, it even throws me off when I'm watching anime and I've been watching anime for how long now! I guess it's something hard to get used to."
kpop,3dwjq5,uh_oh_hotdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:39:20 2015 UTC,I find that to be the case with almost every Korean song translated into Japanese. The syllables and timing just don't match after translation.
kpop,3dwjq5,DennisDoyle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"idk the only part that sounds uncomfortable for me is choa's part at the start, i dont think that translated well at all"
kpop,3dwjq5,Monkeylabs,8,Mon Jul 20 07:37:00 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know how well do the individual members speak Japanese? Choa, Mina and Yuna seem to be fluent in it, but I'm not sure about the others. Were all members required to be trained in Japanese, since Japan is one of their target audience?"
kpop,3dwjq5,DICKSLIDE,9,Mon Jul 20 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"I actually like this version better then the original, minus the fact that they somehow managed to fuck up the audio quality even worse than the original mv like seriously"
kpop,3dwjq5,eatinglegos,3,Mon Jul 20 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it might just be how in the Korean version of the MV the mixing sounded horrible, but the studio version seemed fine. Plus, the fact that it was rerecorded into Japanese and it sounds weird since you're expecting it to sound like the Korean version."
kpop,3dwjq5,steamedcat,2,Mon Jul 20 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"I think the quality of the music/mixing/production may just be lower for the Japanese version. A lot of times when artists re record for the Japanese version, the production qualityof the vocals is worse. Listen to the Japanese version of Mr. Mr. compared to the Korean version. The Korean version has that recognizable SNSD harmony while in the Japanese version the vocals sound all smushed together and robotic."
kpop,3dwjq5,5thEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:18:32 2015 UTC,"Why though? The vocals themselves might be worse, but there shouldn't be any reason the audio recordings themselves end up worse."
kpop,3dwjq5,isababa12,3,Tue Jul 21 10:17:55 2015 UTC,"Brave Sound...how did you fuck up the vocal to instrumental volume ratio even more!?!??!?!  I can barely hear what the Angels are singing.  I actually like the japanese lyrics, it has a nice flow to it, but I really hope that one day AOA will be able to break free from Brave Sound or that Brave Sound will stop forcing artists to scream their name in a song's opener."
kpop,3dwjq5,mirenthil,3,Mon Jul 20 10:22:58 2015 UTC,i dunno man this sounds weird
kpop,3dwjq5,nnworb,2,Mon Jul 20 12:52:46 2015 UTC,This was pretty terrible. OT but I live in Japan and was suprised to hear Like a Cat from time to time. I don't usually hear kpop in public
kpop,3dwjq5,czscoop,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:19 2015 UTC,Do AOA members know the Japanese language fluently? This version sounds fine to me!
kpop,3dwjq5,5thEagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:29:14 2015 UTC,The pronunciation itself doesn't sound too bad at all; the phrasing is just butchered because the translation and fitting was bad.
kpop,3dwjq5,mylord420,2,Tue Jul 21 10:14:45 2015 UTC,Japanese versions of songs never sound good. the way a song rhymes and flows never translates well. The music is made to sound good with the way the song sounds in the original language. So trying to say the new lines in the same old way but extremely differently because of a different language just doesn't work.
kpop,3dwjq5,Ziiaaaac,2,Mon Jul 20 07:36:08 2015 UTC,After listening to the Korean version at least 500 times this sounds really really weird :/

kpop,3dvzmh,m-i-r-a-g-e,30,Mon Jul 20 00:09:28 2015 UTC,WOW.  I forgot how their band and arranging for live performance makes things even better sometimes. Sober needs to be heard live. All the instrumental and delivery issues I had were solved. The energy and performance were great! I wish there was an official live recording of this.   EDIT: I might have to rip the mp3 and edit it down. TOP was a fucking superstar. GD was the business. Seungri was in it to fucking win it. And Dae was drumming his heart out.
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,7,Mon Jul 20 00:33:56 2015 UTC,Daesung slayed the fuck outta this song.
kpop,3dvzmh,FyahCuh,3,Mon Jul 20 09:23:52 2015 UTC,He's totally in his element. Freakin' rocked!
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,5,Mon Jul 20 12:04:05 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree, I wasn't really into the over-produced studio version of sober, but this is an amazing performance, so much energy and I think I even prefer Seungri and GD's vocals"
kpop,3dvzmh,sunshibe,6,Mon Jul 20 00:45:13 2015 UTC,Yeah. I really wanted more from the back end in the released version. But this made up for it. Seems this was the plan all along.  Seungri has really come a long way. My favorite in this version.
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,6,Mon Jul 20 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"I think that Seungri can afford to have rougher, deeper vocals when YB and Daesung both have strong parts so I love seeing this"
kpop,3dvzmh,sunshibe,2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I've been waiting for it since Love Song. I really hope that continues."
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,2,Mon Jul 20 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"All I've ever wanted since I heard A Fool's Only Tears is for Taeyang, Seungri and Daesung to have a JYJ-style mini-album but it doesn't look like we will ever get that now :( They sound so good together, not that I dislike T.O.P or GD in any songs obviously"
kpop,3dvzmh,sunshibe,3,Mon Jul 20 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"They were supposed to around the GD&TOP time, but it ultimately got scrapped. I want that as well.  I mean...once TOP leaves for his extended military vacation, lots of solo and subunits might work."
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:18 2015 UTC,We could finally get GDYB... or maybe GDVI? I can't imagine any more solo albums unless it's finally a Korean Daesung album. Probably nothing though the way YG has been lately. It's July 20th and in 2015 so far there have been 7 songs released by YG artists total -_-
kpop,3dvzmh,sunshibe,3,Mon Jul 20 01:05:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of okay with GDYB for now. GD is probably gonna make a last album push before his enlistment, so maybe in a couple years or so. GD and Seungri would be a great combo! Seungri has years before he has to go, so I'm expecting a couple minis or a full album or something.  The day we get a Korean Dae album will be a glorious one."
kpop,3dvzmh,life-finds-a-way,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that solo promotions will be made a priority at YG though, they will have had 5 months dedicated only to their album promotions and world tour, meanwhile we have winner, akmu, lee hi and iKON who people are desperate for more of. It qouldn't surprise me if there are already a few albums ready to be released whilst members are in the military, we haven't had a T.O.P solo album yet so he could have that released as a send-off before he leaves"

kpop,3dvv8m,herere,6,Mon Jul 20 01:23:30 2015 UTC,He makes literal gold.
kpop,3dvv8m,godlymelonx,4,Sun Jul 19 23:42:53 2015 UTC,Is this going to be a full album or a single with 2 or 3 tracks?
kpop,3dvv8m,m-i-r-a-g-e,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:09 2015 UTC,I assume single with 2 or 3 tracks because it has a similar title and cover to his last 2 mini's. Last one's were 2-1 and 2-2 this one is called 2-3.
kpop,3dvv8m,m-i-r-a-g-e,2,Sun Jul 19 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I thought this as well. Let's hope for 3 tracks, like 2-1."
kpop,3dvv8m,jakobdorof,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"single, but it's building up to an album release in august"
kpop,3dvv8m,SmackPatterson,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:31 2015 UTC,This pleases me.
kpop,3dvv8m,bamboosaou,3,Sun Jul 19 23:35:46 2015 UTC,Let's hope he won't be accused of Plagiarism like in the past.

kpop,3dwm2m,dazzlingboy,8,Mon Jul 20 03:32:57 2015 UTC,I'm kinda disappointed because I expected most of the song to be what the 30-40 last seconds were. I still like it tho. :I
kpop,3dwm2m,Lilyhd,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:16 2015 UTC,"Urgh, but I'm still so pissed because that last part is so DAAMN good."
kpop,3dwm2m,Lilyhd,4,Mon Jul 20 04:38:46 2015 UTC,"That's what teasers will do unfortunately haha. I'm still mad at SM for Mr.Mr.'s deceptive teaser.  I've been playing this song on loop for a while now though and after you get past expecting the chorus to be the teaser, it still sounds amazing. If they never dropped the second teaser, I'm sure the reactions would be stronger."

kpop,3dwm2m,Bescheiden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:21 2015 UTC,Apparently Hwang Hyun produced this.
kpop,3dwm2m,djswims,0,Mon Jul 20 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"THIS IS SO FIRE  And I see they're keeping the trend of the girl groups at 2:51 with ""kungkungdae"".  It makes me sad that they're probably not going to win anything and picked the worst time to promote because this definitely deserves a few wins."
kpop,3dwm2m,gyrobot,3,Mon Jul 20 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"They are already going for 19+ with their MV, that instantly removes a good chunk of the total to their music show vote count."
kpop,3dwm2m,djswims,2,Mon Jul 20 05:41:04 2015 UTC,"When they're up against APink, SNSD, Girl's Day, etc who will get many views by default, they might as well go all out and hope the wow factor draws in more purchases."

kpop,3dwf15,HvDreamer,6,Mon Jul 20 02:27:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like this is going to be an awesome mini-album. :D
kpop,3dwf15,mister-tinkles,6,Mon Jul 20 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"The title track sounds really good so far, I CAN'T WAIT! The rest of the mini album honestly sounds amazing as well. I personally like Whatcha Talkin About the most so far aside from the title track. Let's gooooo girls try to increase that public recognition as much as possible!"
kpop,3dwf15,explodingmangopandas,5,Mon Jul 20 03:44:16 2015 UTC,I'm going to love this. I can already feel it. The title track sounds exactly like my style. I hope they get more love after this promotion. They're such amazing girls.
kpop,3dwf15,euphoricnight,4,Mon Jul 20 05:00:32 2015 UTC,I can't wait to hear the whole thing. Those song sound really fun!
kpop,3dwf15,LadyFrenzy,2,Mon Jul 20 03:12:14 2015 UTC,Those pics~! Could they be the photocards? What I'd give to get that second one of Yooyoung Q_Q she's stunning
