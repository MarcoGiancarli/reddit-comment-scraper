To take an example, Jeff Gertsmann was fired from Gamespot for writing an honest review of a game, while the game was being advertized heavily on Gamespot."
stanisms,3ah5o9,Toastly,7,Sat Jun 20 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a circular reasoning: hey what journalists do is ethical, because that's the accepted standard in the industry, because the industry is ethical, because ..  Well, no. Any group can confiscate a label and re-purpose it slowly by slipping the standards. Doesn't change the actual definition of the words behind the label."

According to the side bar, generally funny comparisons is the only criteria needed.

I've been subscribed here for just over half a year, and this is the first I'm hearing of these more specific guidelines. Can you think of any examples/link to posts that fit what you're talking about? To be honest, although the concept sounds interesting, it seems like redundant analogies would get real old real fast."
