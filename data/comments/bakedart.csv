bakedart,3dh181,charlie6969,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, OP. I'm having trouble figuring out why you would need a Kickstarter to start this? It's a coloring book. Your art, paper, printer and staples. So, what am I missing?  Don't get me wrong, I dig your stuff. It's just that handmade coloring books are sold on Etsy, already. No Kickstarter required.   Not sure why your production costs would be so high.. hehe high  Good luck with whatever you do. :)"
bakedart,3dh181,charlie6969,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it does cost about $5,000 to get it printed, and done nicely. Plus I want to pay the artists that are contributing. You're right -- i could probably make it work without the kickstarter, but I figured this was a good way to get the word out and let people pre-order them if they like. If $15 is too much for you, man, pay what you can and put in the Note that you're charlie6969 from reddit. I'll make sure you get one."
bakedart,3dh181,charlie6969,2,Fri Jul 17 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes more sense. I didn't realize that had some outside artists, too.

bakedart,37mrxd,asrokirbbutts,1 point,Thu May 28 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Are you gonna make it into a cartoon? Maybe you can slightly animate the 3 images, and have the text to be read in voiceover"
bakedart,37mrxd,TheOneManBand,1 point,Fri May 29 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure yet, I may try to keep doing it as large watercolor panels so that I can fit a bit more narrative than a comic, though if I could figure out how to animate this, I definitely would. I understand the wall of unorganized text causes this project to seem daunting/difficult/confusing for people to read, but that style was definitely intentional when I was making it. I was trying to capture a sense of an altered mental state so that those reading might experience (some of) the disjointed flurry of thoughts of a person with Tourette's Syndrome would have when experiencing cognitive dissonance as a result of years of mental oppression. If I could capture that same feeling of uncomfortably and uneasiness with a voiceover I would consider doing that."
bakedart,37mrxd,TheOneManBand,1 point,Fri May 29 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"When I started reading I kinda felt like more than one voice where talking over each other. You could probably do something like that, although you might end up with either one main speech plus many small minor speeches, or a complete mess that nobody can understand. However I think the second option is better, if you manage to find a way to give the chance to actually hear one speech if focusing enough on it, isolating the rest.  Artistically I presume the wall of text is of greater impact, as we dealt with overlapping thoughts in movies before.  I think you could try scanning the image, and placing different characters and planes on different layers. Then you could have a slight 3d panning with the guy in the foreground appears to be moving more, and the background appears to be moving less"
