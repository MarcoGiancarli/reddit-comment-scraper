OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,someonesopranos,59,Mon Jul 20 13:36:31 2015 UTC,It's so weird to think about the Ottoman empire and airplanes existing at the same time.
OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,inpu,23,Mon Jul 20 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"officially existed until 1922, so yeah, barely"
OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,ndydl,9,Mon Jul 20 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"Well, if you call their 1918-1922 existence actually existing, yeah they lasted until 1922. After WWI, they were essentially dismantled by the Entente powers."
OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,Sothar,17,Mon Jul 20 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"The Ottoman Empire lasted for more than 600 years. How about the Ottoman Empire and the Roman Empire? In fact, the Ottoman Empire conquered the Roman Empire - in the 15th century."
OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,misternumberone,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"While technically still a continuation of sorts of the ancient Roman Empire, I hate that characterization given all the political changes in between"

The dominant area - economically, politically, and culturally - had been the Greek east for centuries. The dominant language had been Greek even before that."
OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,IVIauser,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"But not in the same entity. Its like saying ""China"" is thousand of years old.... no its not. Hell everything a new Emperor came around it was more or less a whole new country"

OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,r_e_k_r_u_l,13,Mon Jul 20 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"Except the Roman Empire never really split... The tradition of multiple emperors and multiple Imperial courts stretches back to the 3rd century. It came out of the Crisis of the 3rd Century when Diocletian realized how impossible it was to govern the entire Empire from just Rome.   Romans still considered themselves one Empire but split administration between as many as 4 imperial courts between the 3rd and 5th century. Also, once the ""Western Empire"" fell, the Byzantines did reconquer it for a time. The terms ""Western Roman Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman/ Byzantine Empire"" are more historiographical terms used to differentiate the semi autonomous parts of the empire rather than literal descriptors. If you called someone in Roman Gaul a ""Western Roman"" or tell them that they didn't live in the same Empire as someone in Constantinople they would think you were crazy. Similarly if you called a someone a ""Byzantine"" they would have no idea what you were talking about."
