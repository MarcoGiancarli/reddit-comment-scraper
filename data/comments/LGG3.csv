LGG3,3e3v05,BiggusDikus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:12 2015 UTC,Amazing shot :) I had some good shots too while on AOSP but the biggest downside for me was the inconsistency. I don't like to retake pictures a lot.
LGG3,3e3v05,AnWar90,-4,Tue Jul 21 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"Shhh, don't point out that you can actually get fairly decent to great shots on a ROM that's not stock based. People here will tear you apart, telling you it's still shit and that it will never ever EVER compare to the stock camera and it's no use in trying to get stock results on an AOSP ROM.   But that aside, not bad. Which exact Motorola camera is it? I've used the Lenovo one and some other that was packaged with it, but neither are that great and the controls suck a lot. I've wanted to use Jishnu Sur's HTC M9 camera mod, but I've been waiting for version 3 which he promised well around 2+ months ago now. And I've wanted to use a Motorola camera but I always hear/see mixed results and hear about different models/versions and what not."
LGG3,3e3v05,CoolJumper,12,Tue Jul 21 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yes you can get fairly decent shots, but under poor light and looking at a ""bigger"" picture it doesn't hold a candle to the stock camera. The reason a lot of people care is the LG Gx line has always said to have an amazing camera, so by flashing non-stock you are taking away a key feature that was a selling point of the phone.  I used CM 12.1 for a month or two and switched back because I found that pictures that didn't have the sun in them turned out extremely grainy.   I think you need to take a chill pill. Everyone here is very friendly and simply offers the warning that the camera isn't the highest of quality on CM 12.1. No one ever flames someone for using that software."
LGG3,3e3v05,adyum,2,Tue Jul 21 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wish I could use stock for just this reason but playing music through Bluetooth in my car won't work with Verizon's Lollipop update, even after latest 24b.  The only ROM that it works with is CM12.  I don't understand it and I've tried everything to get back on stock but I use Bluetooth 3 times a day and need that more."
