homeowners,3e72uz,UnicornToots,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:34:44 2015 UTC,"Turn the AC unit on earlier?  I don't think you need to get the temp down to 68 degrees though, I think between 70 and 72 is fine.  I think having the temperature down to 66 degrees is a little too cold though. If your AC is set to 70 degrees, why is it not shutting off when it drops below that?  You could try changing the direction of your fan.  Typically in the summer you want the fan to blow downward to increase the cooling effect by moving air over your body, but if your goal is to have a more even distribution of the air in the room then having it pull upward instead should help with this."

That's what I mention at the end of my post; I'll do that if it's my only option, but I'd like to know if there are other options.   If your AC is set to 70 degrees, why is it not shutting off when it drops below that?   Two thoughts:   The AC measures the temperature at its location, and the gauge I put in the bedroom was put in a different location (as mentioned, I put it on a nightstand that is close to where the baby will be so I could monitor the temperature in that location rather than the ambient temperature in the middle of the room or something). The AC is a non-fancy, 6-year-old, hand-me-down and I'm unsure if it automatically shuts off anyway.    if your goal is to have a more even distribution of the air in the room then having it pull upward instead should help with this   I thought about this, but haven't tried it yet. I think I'll give it a try tonight. Thanks!"
homeowners,3e72uz,Eccentrica_Gallumbit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:58:24 2015 UTC,"Other than finding a way to vent the hot air out before having the AC go to work, I think your only option for cooling earlier is to turn on the AC sooner.    As far as your set point, if it's not turning off at temperature you may want to look into getting a temperature switch installed (similar to this) in order to make sure you're not freezing your baby in the middle of the night.  Set your thermometer near the AC unit for a couple nights and see how low it gets below your set point.  If it's never kicking off, either get a new AC or install a limit switch.  You may want to consider a new AC anyway since they make significant improvements each year and tend to get more efficient and use less energy.  A lot even have rebates associated with them as well."
homeowners,3e72uz,gzzvv,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"That temperature switch looks great. I'll pay more attention to the AC to see if it does shut off by turning on the unit earlier. It runs while I sleep, so when it goes below the set point, I'm already asleep and don't hear it! If something seems awry, I'll look into that temperature switch and try to make sure I program it so that the area the bassinet will be in will be at the correct temperature (not necessarily where the AC actually is).  Thank you!"

The AC unit is large enough as it is eventually reaching the desired temperature (although it is doing so when the night air is cooler).  How old is the AC unit?  Are you sure it is performing properly?  68, especially with a baby is a bit cold.  Most central AC units in public spaces are set at 72-73 degrees and it feels comfortable to most people."

As long as you don't disturb it and get the fibers into the air you will be ok. Cover up what is already exposed. It's not like it's going to give you cancer through the tile or anything. Then if you still want to get rid of the tile make sure you bring in someone qualified to do it. It's going to be a nasty job that will cost you.

homeowners,3dy4zc,SquidThistle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:14 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one.  My bet is that even though you have fans blowing in and fans blowing out, you don't really have a good cross-flow of air because of your house's configuration.  If windows are not somewhat across from each other, the air you are pulling in will just get blocked by a wall and not reach other parts of the house.  I also bet your house has plaster walls and ceilings because of it's age, which may be part of the reason your house contains the temperature so well.  I would recommend a whole house fan.  I used one in Texas in a house we had no A/C in and it made an enormous difference.  They are quite strong in terms of how much air they move, but they can be noisy.  We installed it in a hallway attic access panel.  It could exchange the air in our 1000 sq ft house in a matter of minutes when all the windows were open."
homeowners,3dy4zc,awhq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, my walls/ceiling are plaster. My home's layout is poor for cross-ventilation too. The rooms are very modular, separated only by doorways without hallways in a rather strange layout. Any air coming in from a window would likely have to squeeze through a standard-sized doorway to get to another window.   I'll definitely look into a whole house fan, thank you! I didn't know these existed but it sounds like it'd be really helpful."

My wife prefers to keep the bedroom door closed, but on seeing the change in day-time temperature after keeping it open at night, has consented to keeping it open when it's hot so we can cool the house down.   It makes a huge difference whether the door is opened or closed.  However, an open door should be more than adequate to cool the room down overnight."

homeowners,3dz4wm,Jviv308,6,Mon Jul 20 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm an engineer, but here's how I'd look at it:  5 [work days/week] * 49 [work weeks/year - assuming 2 weeks vacation, an additional week worth of holidays] * 1.25 [additional hours spent commuting per direction] * 2 [directions/day] = 612.5 extra hours spent each year commuting.  612.5 = additional hours per year commuting  612.5 / 24 = 25.5 additional days spent commuting a year  365 / 25.5 = 14.31 - so, if you live in this house and commute per this schedule, by the time you will have lived there 15 years you will have spent an entire year commuting that you wouldn't have had to spend if you lived closer in.  Some people have to do this for various reasons (new job at a new location but don't want to switch houses, etc.), but 2.5 additional hours a day commuting is just a lot of someone's life to spend in a car. I wouldn't do this unless my situation changed and I just had to, but that's just me."

With a 30 year fixed and a 10% down, we're looking at about $2000 monthly payments, which is about the average price for rent out here. With a $120K joint income, it's extremely cheap, but that's why we were looking at closer to $200K on a $70K income, which would bring the monthly down to only about $1200. I have some friends that just moved to Montana who are only paying about $600/month on their home. It's crazy to hear how cheap it is everywhere else in America!"

homeowners,3dwo0z,anuthadimension,2,Mon Jul 20 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"First, your counter top is made of Formica (a brand name), or more generically, laminate (not linoleum).  As you are in a rental property, you need to be careful that the landlord could dock you if you attempt a repair and the repair goes wrong...it is unlikely, but it could happen.  For the counter, you would need to find a scrap of laminate, cut to size, and cover both the back side of the laminate and the top surface of the counter top substrate with contact cement, and then stick the two together.  It will be far from a perfect match in pattern, there will be a visible seam, and the patch might be slightly higher than the rest of the counter top.  Simple fix, buy a glass cutting board http://www.walmart.com/c/kp/glass-cutting-boards or similar and place it over the hole.  As for the sink, most of the repair kits are for small chips, not something several inches long.  They do make repair kits, most are not rated highly, and could cause the sink to look worse.

homeowners,3dtleu,myanodyne,3,Sun Jul 19 11:41:47 2015 UTC,"Chimney, and drains. Both are issues I ran into buying a home that was vacant for a year. Have your meter and electrical panel inspected for water intrusion. Termites, spiders and other bugs could have taken up residence. Unless the roof is newer have that looked at. There could be water damage and mold if it was leaking and went unnoticed. If you're in a region that gets cold, plumbing could have burst if there was water in the lines and the place wasn't heated. On that note make sure copper wasn't stolen.  I'd get that inspection ASAP before you move in. Especially if you're just purchasing it. The house could be perfect, or you could be opening a can of worms.  Edit: Depending on the type of heat, if any, and hit water have that looked over and get basic maintenance done on it if any is recommended. My on-demand gas unit requires annual maintenance, some oil boilers and forced air systems need regular maintenance as well."
homeowners,3dtleu,colonelpan1c,2,Sun Jul 19 12:23:57 2015 UTC,"If the water has been turned off for more than a few months, make sure to check and recheck plumbing for leaks.   Water valve packing and gaskets in pvc drains can dry out over time will cause leaks which may not show up immediately."
homeowners,3dtleu,thewebgeek,2,Sun Jul 19 12:48:28 2015 UTC,"Home inspector here. Was the house regularly checked during the vacancy, and were the utilities always on? If so, there shouldn't be major issues due to its being vacant. BUT, if the utilities have been off for two years, there could be a LOT of problems, ranging from burst pipes and insect/animal infestation to warped floors and corrosion on the electrical systems. Modern houses were not designed to withstand wide fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Electrical elements such as GFCI outlets can fail to operate properly unless ""exercised"" regularly (which is why you should test GFCI outlets every month). Drain traps dry out due to evaporation, allowing sewer gases to enter the house. And there can be dangers even if utilities are left on: a water heater can have a buildup of hydrogen gas that can ignite when it comes in contact with an ignition source (which is why I don't test dishwashers in vacant homes... Too much risk of causing an explosion if gases come in contact with the heating element)."
homeowners,3dtleu,welmoed,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this information.  It seems everyone is pushing (as I kind of was too) to get an inspector in there before I have a chance to move in.  Are inspectors usually tough to schedule or can they come over with a day or two's notice?  Also I was thinking about having a second inspector come to back-up the claims of the first, what do you think?"
homeowners,3dtleu,nobody2000,3,Sun Jul 19 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"In my area, most inspectors can book with 1-5 day's notice - they're generally only as busy as the market, and unless your area has super rapid sales and low inspector competition, it shouldn't be a problem.  With that said, I had a great home inspector who spent about 3 hours in my 1400 sqft home. He took pictures and included them in his report. Explained everything to me, and really dug at every problem.   When you book one, mention the specifics of the house so he/she knows how much time he'll have to spend, in case he needs another hour or two to dig at some likely problem areas."
homeowners,3dtleu,nobody2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:05:16 2015 UTC,would you recommend getting a second opinion or in general are inspectors pretty trustworthy?
homeowners,3dtleu,welmoed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"This is a tough question.   I would consider most licensed inspectors trustworthy. The problem is that while they all do an honest report, and things like that, many of them don't do a thorough job. You definitely don't want an inspector who does ONLY obvious shit like checking the water pressure, checking for obvious leaks, etc.   You want someone who's thorough, and ideally, who will give you a report with pictures at the end (it's super helpful - I just moved into my house a month ago and still refer to that report all the time). Some will try to give suggestions on who to call, what to do, how serviceable things are (this is good to know. You want to know if things are serviceable, even if there's nothing wrong with them. If he finds something that's in top condition, but will require replacement when it's broken, he ought to make a note of it, just like he should make a note of something that's in awful condition but easily serviceable).   My suggestion, get only one inspection (as they get costly). Don't talk to realtors for who to inspect, but get your own guy. Angie's List was reliable for me. My realtor recommended my guy, but he was ranked #1 in my city anyway. I was lucky, but most realtors don't go for the most thorough, but rather someone who does a decent job but aims to give good news to the buyer so they don't walk away."
homeowners,3dtleu,CurlyCurler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"If you choose your inspector carefully, a ""second opinion"" really won't be necessary. The best inspectors may be difficult to get on short notice, but do try. Go to the ASHI website and search for inspectors in your area. Interview them to find the one you're comfortable with. Ask other people in the development who they used, what they thought about them, and what kinds of defects were found. Tell your builder you intend to get a pre-drywall and a final inspection and ask them to notify you what dates will work for them (remember, they own the house... they can control who gets in). Be polite. As soon as you have a date, make the appointment with the inspector.  Good luck!"
homeowners,3dtleu,Cheesey_Cakes,2,Sun Jul 19 20:52:24 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why you are not doing the inspection during the negotiation process?   The purpose of an inspection is to protect the buyer.
