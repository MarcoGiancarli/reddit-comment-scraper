MCFC,3e21pk,brian_d3p0,22,Tue Jul 21 10:24:31 2015 UTC,The most important thing is now we have a player other than aguero who can run through on goal beating this offside trap with amazing pace and speed
MCFC,3e21pk,Shahzad1123,0,Tue Jul 21 11:29:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously. People are focusing so much on the 49 mil that some super rich guy has to pay instead of buying himself another island, meanwhile, the difference between him and Nasri or Navas is so huge to me."
MCFC,3e21pk,ghost10101,11,Tue Jul 21 23:23:20 2015 UTC,Was that Nacho with the assist?
MCFC,3e21pk,KurtCobanus,15,Tue Jul 21 10:52:49 2015 UTC,Sure was. Looked amazing out there today. So composed
MCFC,3e21pk,convex101,13,Tue Jul 21 11:12:59 2015 UTC,And he scored! So excited for this kid.
MCFC,3e21pk,KurtCobanus,28,Tue Jul 21 11:18:12 2015 UTC,Shut all the assholes up that were booing him. He also had two penalty shouts. The first one I wasn't sure but the second was a penalty all day son.
MCFC,3e21pk,MashedHair,6,Tue Jul 21 10:52:21 2015 UTC,Anyone have a link for the penalty shout?
MCFC,3e21pk,sfida95,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:25:56 2015 UTC,This right here... Why are all the fans booing him before he's had a chance to play a game? I don't understand where the animosity is coming from.   He's a solid player and we're making it seem like he's not wanted here. This needs to stop
MCFC,3e21pk,gbmaruggi,4,Tue Jul 21 14:49:52 2015 UTC,I don't think it was our fans. The commentator said there's a lot of Liverpool fans in Australia and it could also be the Roma fans.
MCFC,3e21pk,blatom75,3,Tue Jul 21 17:37:59 2015 UTC,The guy beside me was a Roma fan and he was booing for some dumb reason. The goal shut him up quick smart though.
MCFC,3e21pk,MashedHair,3,Tue Jul 21 14:58:27 2015 UTC,Such a perfect response from Raheem! I hope he does that every time people start to boo him
MCFC,3e21pk,gbmaruggi,5,Tue Jul 21 16:35:41 2015 UTC,I'm in love
MCFC,3e21pk,TheBobbyDude,2,Tue Jul 21 10:44:46 2015 UTC,Did Nacho even look before his little dink?
MCFC,3e21pk,ibpants,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"Amazing assist by Iheanacho, too. Look at the way the ball bounces back into the path of Sterling"
MCFC,3e21pk,CallMeGrapho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"Good job Raheem! Liverpool fan here, but I would hate to see this guy have a hard time! Both Clubs profited from this transfer, good business all around; taking into consideration that money is not much of an issue to you lot, and that we needed the coin to rebuild from our last season. As long as he doesn't score against Liverpool, I wish him all the best. Would love seeing Razza hit a few past united next season."
MCFC,3e21pk,ControversialFan,0,Tue Jul 21 22:44:40 2015 UTC,should have passed it
MCFC,3e28a0,domalino,10,Tue Jul 21 11:51:27 2015 UTC,The more I watch him the more excited I get. Seems similar enough to Robben in as much as that he loves to run to the box and cut back for shots. So whats next for him another year in the EDS or time for a loan?
MCFC,3e28a0,joe_mamma_,11,Tue Jul 21 12:21:57 2015 UTC,"He's been linked with a loan move to Uwe Rosler's Leeds which I think would be perfect for him. The championship is competitive, physical and a high level of competition."

MCFC,3e28a0,mitchsusername,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:53:13 2015 UTC,Hoping he comes to NY. I doubt this will happen but it would mean I would be able to watch him a lot so I would be happy.
MCFC,3e28a0,njf88,6,Tue Jul 21 15:32:56 2015 UTC,"This could be my own issue, but when I look at Barker I see English football personified.  I'd be torn between sending him to a Championship club to further develop his strengths against some quality defences, or send him to the continent to try and add a few strings to his bow.  I don't think MLS is for him because he'd probably get neither benefit."
MCFC,3e28a0,ibpants,5,Tue Jul 21 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. IMO he needs to be up against faster, stronger players, who have seen wingers like him 100 times before.  In the youth FA Cup final he got shut down by chelsea. Their right back was bigger and faster than him, and Barker didn't know what else to do, drifted out of the game for 70 minutes and then started to figure out how to get around the problem.   I think when he goes on loan he will struggle initially, because experienced pro's will deal with him quite comfortably if he doesn't learn to add things to his game quickly."
MCFC,3e28a0,njf88,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"I was only saying for my enjoyment, Leeds is probably the best option."

MCFC,3e5a30,Andtheyrustledsoftly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"Hope you're right. The thought of Silva, Kun, Sterling, and KDB gets me erect. Just Silva and Sterling by themselves were outstanding. Stick Kun and KDB in there and we are unstoppable."
MCFC,3e5a30,Ruffr3tard,2,Wed Jul 22 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"I know the 4-3-3 is being thrown around quite a bit, but I just have this gut feeling that Pelli will have em line up in the ol' 4-2-3-1. It just seems to be the formation best suited for the physicality of the PL. If that's the case, Nasri has done quite well playing as a left or right midfielder in the past. Let's saw we DO ket KDB, then you have any combo of Silva, KDB, Nasri on the left, Silva or KDB in the hole, and Sterling, Navas, or really any of the others on the right but Sterling or Navas or the obvious choices.   tl;dr the 4-3-3 is not a forgone conclusion, don't be surprised if it's scrapped for the more classic Pelli formations. Also tactics and lineups change often throughout not only the season but during games."
MCFC,3e5a30,nsilv0414,2,Wed Jul 22 03:22:26 2015 UTC,If we get KDB I don't think nasri even makes it into our best 11. I agree though if we go with a front three he'll be put in the midfield.
MCFC,3e5a30,adamnchow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"Doesnt throwing nasri or silva as a part of the midfield 3 sort of defeat the purpose of the formation. It may be set on paper but im sure nasri or silva wouldn't have a high pressing game and dont run back and forth , they tend to look for pockets of spaces left and right and with yaya wanting to move foward it would leave us in the same situation as the 442 formation. I would rather have nando/dinho sit back and dinho/delph or even pogba be the high pressing player and let yaya do yaya with sterling and silva or nasri drifting around the wings and cutting in."
MCFC,3e5a30,V4Kompany,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"So far in the preseason games Garcia or Lopes at the head of midfield have played further forward than the other two without much serious tracking back. One of the two true CMs sits back and holds all the time (A Fern), while the other roams forward and back depending on the situation (Yaya and Zuculini). It's a 4-3-3 that looks a lot like a 4-2-3-1 on defense especially. Silva is perfect for the CAM at the head of midfield and distributing into the attack. Nasri or KDB are more suited to the wing."
MCFC,3e29ij,xx_rudyh_xx,40,Tue Jul 21 12:04:20 2015 UTC,"Happy he saved Doumbia's penalty, that guy has fucked us over too many times"

MCFC,3e29ij,glob3trott3r,8,Tue Jul 21 12:12:02 2015 UTC,Looking at his reactions at the game and the tunnel interview on mcfc.co.uk he seems to hate chipped penalties. I suppose I would find them disrespectful if I was in his position.
MCFC,3e29ij,Jangles,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:31 2015 UTC,He got done by Pirlo in the euros with one so its bound to give him a bit of a chip on his shoulder

MCFC,3e32uz,TillWeGrowOlder,24,Tue Jul 21 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"The thing that excites me the most is the fact I can't say who our most talented player is. Barker and Lopes are so exciting to watch. Kelechi is so talented while Manu Garcia is so composed and such a Spanish midfielder (lol this is the highest praise for a midfielder). In defence we have Denayer, who is probably the best U-21 defender and Angelino is such a exciting prospect. The future is so bright for City and I hope we bleed most of these kids in.   Edit: The craziest thing is I forgot about Pozo, who seemed like our best talent during the season, hopefully he bounces back after his injury. Also Patrick Roberts is insanely talented and has world class potential aswell."
MCFC,3e32uz,Hamsterdam95,16,Tue Jul 21 16:40:17 2015 UTC,"If Moutinho and Silva had a baby, it would be called Manu Garcia.   I'm so excited to see him come through. Everyone should watch him next year just so you can say you watched him when he was still in the academy."
MCFC,3e32uz,domalino,3,Tue Jul 21 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind, what is Moutinho supposed to be as a player? Never saw him play."
MCFC,3e32uz,sfida95,3,Tue Jul 21 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"He's a lot like Deco was, or a Spanish Lampard. Always keeps hold of possession, fantastic passing range, dictates the play, always finds a pocket of space to receive the ball, knows how to score.   He's a wonderful player to watch. It's funny because Portuguese fans say that he was ruined when he went to Porto from sporting. That his progress was hampered and he never got reached the heights he was supposed to, but he's still one of the best CMs in the world."
MCFC,3e32uz,domalino,14,Tue Jul 21 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"We're not even mentioning Sterling in this thread, who is only 20 and might be the best u-21 player in the world. Rony, Nacho, Manu, Barker, Denayer all look like they could work their way into the first team in the coming years with Rony, Nacho, and Denayer looking poised to get into the first team this year."
MCFC,3e32uz,JimmothyTwinkletoes,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:27 2015 UTC,I completely forgot to mention him. brilliant player and I think I agree about him being one of the best u21's in the world
MCFC,3e32uz,sfida95,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:07 2015 UTC,Could we play him in the EDS? he'll be tearing shit apart there
MCFC,3e32uz,Andtheyrustledsoftly,7,Tue Jul 21 18:21:50 2015 UTC,But why? He starts in our first XI?
MCFC,3e32uz,TomShoe,0,Tue Jul 21 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it's kind of fun to think how ridiculous he would be on the EDS squad."
MCFC,3e32uz,abellwillring,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:37 2015 UTC,You can technically play anyone in the EDS even if they're over 21. You get 3 slots for over age players.  But he'd only ever play there if coming off an injury and rehabbing.

MCFC,3e32uz,SamIffy,14,Wed Jul 22 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"If Dzeko and Jovetic leave (which they almost certainly will) then that will leave Iheanacho third in the pecking order (behind Aguero and Bony). Now we all know Aguero picks up a few injuries during the season so I can see the youngster being given a chance to make an impact for us this year.   Jason Denayer didn't put a foot wrong today. I'd love to see him stamp his authority in the first few months of the season and form a strong partnership with Vinnie.  I don't think Barker will play a part in the first team this year but another solid year with the EDS should put him in the frame for a role in the senior squad this time next year.   If we don't get De Bruyne then I'd love us to give Lopes a chance, we saw what he's capable of when he tormented West Ham in the League Cup semi final two seasons ago.   All in all the future's bright, the future's BLUE!"
MCFC,3e32uz,mattb2k,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with Barker, he did well at the beginning of the season but slowly declined."
MCFC,3e32uz,amxn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:59 2015 UTC,He's predictable and that's a problem as an attacking player. After a few games most defenses would figure him out. He needs more playing time and learn to mix it up and keep defenses on their feet.
MCFC,3e32uz,Andtheyrustledsoftly,5,Wed Jul 22 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"I think Denayer will be one of the best defenders in the world, if I was hard pressed to select a best, I think it would have to be him."

MCFC,3e2z5n,hey_its_chris,9,Tue Jul 21 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"Just a small correction, Brook's record is 179 goals.   Sergio has 107 total, he'll probably get 30/season so yes, I think he'll eclipse 179 in all comps, mostly because theres so many more comps these days. But the league goals will be harder."
MCFC,3e2z5n,domalino,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:21 2015 UTC,I still expect him to do it. That's about 20 goals a season and I think he's entirely capable of it. He'll be in his prime years for the remainder of his City contract.
MCFC,3e2z5n,mattb2k,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:54 2015 UTC,I don't think Aguero has even peaked yet.

He had an amazing season, and from everything I've seen he's only getting better.  But he's really only performed very well last year, before that he didn't exactly set the world alight, whether it was lack of playing time, etc.  There's no doubt he's good, but he needs to keep performing to be considered one of the best, in my opinion."

He led the league in nothing. He floundered with the ball often (like he did today on his first touch with you), and he was out of position often trying to make something happen without the discipline to be in good space. I grant you he has talent and lots of potential. But he's an unpolished little crybaby with a chip on his shoulder. If you guys can polish him and turn him into something, then that's great.

MCFC,3e206p,Liverpool-FC-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:09 2015 UTC,I bothers me that every Liverpool supporter is talking down on Sterling and emphasize on his flaws after he left. Stop being so bitter.
MCFC,3e206p,MashedHair,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:41:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not bitter. I wasn't a fan of his while he was with us. And I'm glad he's gone. He has not proven to be this amazing player that everyone thinks he is. Look at his numbers. The only thing he has going for him is his age and his huge potential. I admit he has that. But that and a dollar will get me a Pepsi. Until he fulfills that potential, he's just overrated. Only 18 goals in 4 years and he's got a terrible attitude. I know he's young, and time will tell if he's worth it. In 4-5 years he may be the best footballer in the game, and if so then that's great! I'd love to see any young player go on to great success in the sport they love. We'll see."
MCFC,3e206p,MashedHair,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"His attitude is actually great. Just watch some videos, he just wants to play. Rodgers treated him like a child so he behaved like one. We had the same situation with Balotelli and Mancini.  Pellegrini is a much better gaffer for Sterling than Rodgers was"
MCFC,3e206p,Liverpool-FC-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:11 2015 UTC,Pitting words in our months now?  He doesn't need to lead the league in anything. He just needs to contribute to a solid team performance.

MCFC,3e206p,Liverpool-FC-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:47 2015 UTC,You're saying he has done nothing individually. I'm saying it doesn't matter. He just needs to be part of a good City team performance.
MCFC,3e206p,MashedHair,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"49 million is not what you pay for a player that only adds to a good City team performance. You paid for a super star, and I don't think you got one. Yet. In time he may earn that money. Again, we'll see."
MCFC,3e206p,Liverpool-FC-,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:54:24 2015 UTC,"Fair point but that kind of pressure won't make a superstar. If he stays with us for 10 years then it's only 5 mill a year which is totally reasonable. And if he fucks off in 5 to somewhere like Real, then we recoup a lot of the original fee if not gain money. It's not like we need the money..."

MCFC,3e20fk,domalino,10,Tue Jul 21 10:46:28 2015 UTC,Silva and his mini-me are tearing Roma apart here.
MCFC,3e20fk,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,6,Tue Jul 21 10:40:20 2015 UTC,They look really at home together... There movement together is really good.
MCFC,3e20fk,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,10,Tue Jul 21 10:41:07 2015 UTC,Silva is on fire...
MCFC,3e20fk,Fraz0R_Raz0R,13,Tue Jul 21 10:33:33 2015 UTC,Seems pellers has a lot of faith in manu garcia
MCFC,3e20fk,ImRobin,3,Tue Jul 21 10:32:54 2015 UTC,He's the one who has impressed me the most so in this match. Seems very Silva-esque with his ball control and vision.
MCFC,3e20fk,cptz3r0,9,Tue Jul 21 10:48:14 2015 UTC,Now I know why.
MCFC,3e20fk,domalino,10,Tue Jul 21 10:36:37 2015 UTC,He's clearly being fast tracked and for good reason. He started last season in the u16's and now he's on the tour. What a player he could be.
MCFC,3e20fk,chirstopher0us,4,Tue Jul 21 10:39:30 2015 UTC,Do you think this is evidence he's passed Lopes in the pecking order?
MCFC,3e20fk,Saul93,4,Tue Jul 21 10:48:47 2015 UTC,Steady. He's still well behind Lopes
MCFC,3e20fk,domalino,5,Tue Jul 21 10:49:16 2015 UTC,I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if that changed over this year. Some of the EDS watchers on Bluemoon are saying it reminds them of when Fabregas came through and he's the most exciting player they've seen for a long time.

MCFC,3e20fk,domalino,16,Tue Jul 21 10:24:37 2015 UTC,Even in preseason friendlies we're getting robbed of penalties...
MCFC,3e20fk,I_MeltUrSnowCone,6,Tue Jul 21 10:23:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, ref's usually don't like giving penalties in friendlies."
MCFC,3e20fk,PM__ME_YOUR_STOMACH,2,Tue Jul 21 10:40:02 2015 UTC,Anyone know if we have a three sub limit for these games?
MCFC,3e20fk,chirstopher0us,2,Tue Jul 21 10:21:55 2015 UTC,"No, there isn't really a limit. It's been known to do full 11 subs at half time. I don't think he will though, in the last game, he only made 3-4 subs towards the end of the game."
MCFC,3e20fk,flyingguy82,2,Tue Jul 21 10:25:16 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to get a handle on what we're trying in the midfield in preseason. Obviously you don't want to draw conclusions from a couple of preseason games, but it looks to me like we are using a basic shape of two men at the base of the midfield in a double pivot, with one further forward midfielder, though one of the double pivot men (Zuculini) is also joining the attack. That's exactly where I think Yaya should be playing.   On the other hand, Silva is playing as a wing with license to move inside. Even if we don't land KDB or similar, I really think our final first-choice squad should set Silva in the CAM role with Sterling and either Nasri or the new signing as wings. I think Silva is going to be most effective for the rest of his career really working the game from a central creative role.   Good control and pressing so far. Good game minus Pjanic's great strike."

MCFC,3e20fk,chirstopher0us,4,Tue Jul 21 10:17:21 2015 UTC,Nacho is a very promising looking player. I'm so excited!
MCFC,3e20fk,cptz3r0,5,Tue Jul 21 10:14:30 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts in the very early stages:  (1) City are actually going for this, showing a lot more respect for the fans that bought tickets than madrid and roma the last game who really seemed to make a concerted effort to appear like they didnt give a fuck  (2) RAHEEM DEBUT GOAL!!! get in son! he is so penetrative, look how good he his in this half baked squad, imagine him in a full strength XI with aguero on top  (3) Iheanacho is playing so brilliantly, its only 10 mins or so but every touch hes made has been smooth and the way he controls a difficult ball or a ball under pressure is superb  (4) Sagna doesnt offer anything in attack, he's solid defensivley but is horrible going forward, he keeps making small back passes when forward instead of attacking the ball and crossing it into the box like zaba does and iheanacho is forced to do the crossing  (5) The goal we conceded, though a powerfull shot, was poor on the part of cabellero, it was just above him he barely had to move, not too impressed with cabellero so far"
MCFC,3e20fk,Ruffr3tard,3,Tue Jul 21 10:12:47 2015 UTC,"If Pogba won't leave, I wouldn't be opposed to bidding for Pjanic. A less physical player but certainly very good."

MCFC,3e3juj,cacduy,9,Tue Jul 21 18:06:18 2015 UTC,My only knock on him is CL but our struggles have been understandable with BM and Barca.
MCFC,3e3juj,Captluck,14,Tue Jul 21 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"Using youth on the preseason tour doesn't count.   Let's see him give lopes, nacho and Denayer some real game time."
MCFC,3e3juj,domalino,5,Tue Jul 21 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. He earned his role and proved the media wrong at the end of the season, but I think whether he retains here after his contract end will depend on the future season. I think if we finished 3rd but used some youth both you and the board might be rethinking this view this time next year."
MCFC,3e3juj,adnams94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Realistically this could be a positive outcome given how United, Arsenal and even Liverpool have strengthened themselves!  Don't see Chelsea beyond the top 2 places, if we have an incredible season we would be title contenders but with a few injuries, form issues, etc we should be fighting to finish top 3 to land a CL spot."
MCFC,3e3juj,amxn,6,Wed Jul 22 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"My criticism is his reluctance to ever change tactics to fit the opposition, it's more or less the same thing every time.   I like Klopp and Guardiola, but I don't think they're huge steps up and if we're really trying to be ""holistic"" then Pelligrini should get a few more years and then give the reigns to Viera."
MCFC,3e2011,jeremyparnaby,7,Tue Jul 21 10:01:23 2015 UTC,"Very disappointed if this is true. We don't need a CB at all, at least not until next summer. Otamendi is only going to restrict game time for Denayer unless we're offloading Mangala/Demichelis which is highly unlikely.  We need a CM, desperately. I didn't expect Pogba but we need someone like Carvalho. Delph adds depth but he isn't anything close to the player to take that area of the field to the next level and replace Yaya.   My lack of faith in Txiki is only ratified by these 'predictions'. Should they be true. So what he secured Sterling? We were the only club in for him, he wanted to leave, we chucked money at Liverpool. Anyone can do that, that isn't negotiating. Hopefully we'll get De Bruyne but it won't be down to Txiki's wheeling and dealing, it'll be by outpaying everyone else.   The problems from last season will only continue if this is the case.   But as always, much appreciated Jeremy. Why did the Fabinho deal collapse?"

MCFC,3dzw6b,domalino,4,Mon Jul 20 22:41:32 2015 UTC,@City_Watch: Juventus met with Wolfsburg to discuss City target De Bruyne today. They were quoted €60m (£41.7m) which put them off. (via @DiMarzio)
MCFC,3dzw6b,slamminalex1,7,Mon Jul 20 22:02:58 2015 UTC,That's about £10m less then I thought he'd be. Hope they don't try and get more out of us just because it's us.
MCFC,3dzw6b,domalino,3,Mon Jul 20 22:09:30 2015 UTC,The article that this comes from says that the price is too high for Juventus and they won't be signing him. In June KDB said he doesn't want to go to Russia or Italy.  Don't worry.
MCFC,3dzw6b,jsav814,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:36 2015 UTC,Gazzetta mentions City and Bayern being interested in KDB
MCFC,3dzw6b,DwarfwithAutism,3,Mon Jul 20 23:08:10 2015 UTC,It would be really unfortunate if Juventus ended up with both Pogba and de Bruyne next year.
MCFC,3dzw6b,domalino,8,Mon Jul 20 21:50:33 2015 UTC,There's more chance of him going to stoke than Juventus. They don't have a hope in hell of paying the £40-50m that Wolfsburg want.   I would not be losing any sleep over this if I were you. Worry about PSG if you're going to worry about someone else getting KDB.
MCFC,3dzw6b,Masterofknees,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"On top of everything that's been said already De Bruyne has also said himself he doesn't want to play in Serie A as it wouldn't suit his style of play. He'd only consider England, Spain, France and Germany. (at the bottom of the article)"

MCFC,3dz77l,MrEpsilonFTW,15,Mon Jul 20 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"Roughly:  Aguero - 30  Bony - 15  Sterling - 12  Silva - 10  De Bryune - 10  Toure - 8  RoS - 20  Reckon a one striker system will mean less rotation, might let aguero and bony soak up a decent amount of goals.  Assumin de bruyne will sign here, cos im not really sure how'd id set up our squad without him.   This might be alot of goals, but i think seeing as were going nearly all attack this season we could break our goal record. Also if we flop i can just remeasure this list to include all comps - realistically its probably closer to that now as it is.  Edit* - Wildcard prediction, Nacho surprises us all and gets 5 or more from around 10 games. The kid fills me with hope"
MCFC,3dz77l,adnams94,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Too many goals for me. I think we will peak out around 105. I would put it  Agüero-32(Breaks the record) Bony- 17 Yaya-10 Silva-10 Sterling-8 Pogba-8 Nacho-6 Dinho-4 Nando-1 Kolarov-2 Kompany-1 Denayer-1  That gives us 92. Add DeBruyne and I would put another 8-10ish goals in to bring us to 100 but we would concede more too which would either put a net negative on goal differential or maintain it the same. I really think we are wasting a bit by investing in players to pass it to Aguero as that was far from our problem but I can see wanting to find Silva's replacement. I would prefer Isco to De Bruyne because Isco is more physical and actually defends, which De Bruyne is seemingly allergic to. Isco can also slide into a middle 3 better than De Bruyne can.  I also think Sterling's effect will be seen as much or more in other players goal numbers than his own."
MCFC,3dz77l,JimmothyTwinkletoes,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:36 2015 UTC,"Mangala will score 2-4, as he will be the guy we are looking for on corners. But then again its City taking corners :P"
MCFC,3dz77l,franpr95,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:53 2015 UTC,I would love for Mangala to get some goals in. He has quite the springs in his shoes and the size to be a perfect target for corners. I agree though that unless we get a revelation in corner delivery (Kolarov?) his impact will be minimal.

MCFC,3dz77l,jeremyparnaby,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"As a Liverpool fan, I don't see Stirling scoring all that many goals for you guys - he struggled to convert chances last season when playing up front (~53% shot accuracy last season with 435mins per goal).  I do however see him assisting through the roof with the likes of Aguero and Bony up front, and with known scorers in behind like Silva, Nasri and Toure.  I see Stirling playing on the wing, with some freedom to cut into the middle, but ultimately, to provide goals on a platter for those aforementioned.  Don't be surprised if he doubles his 14/15 tally of 7 assists as a result."

MCFC,3dxt2z,Stealthypenguin,6,Mon Jul 20 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"""Our aim is to have a strong squad""   I think that shows that there will definitely be more signings because it's his ""aim"" to have a strong squad.

MCFC,3dxt2z,TheBobbyDude,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:00 2015 UTC,Over on the Bluemoon transfer forum they we're talking about it.  Apparently on Wolfsburgs official site they said he got a knock and would be out all week.  In the forum there is supposedly ITK's with sources close to the club and every once in a while they'll drop some hints on what they think is going down.     It's a dark dark hole though.  Once you go it's hard to leave.

MCFC,3dxt2z,frank_abernathy,5,Mon Jul 20 14:23:18 2015 UTC,Ah I forgot about Denayer coming back from Celtic. Still a dearth of centrebacks. But you're right. I am excited about all these signings either way. Should be a fun season.

MCFC,3dx9ca,Big_12_incher,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:58:14 2015 UTC,It's sad really that people hate on a player for wanting to take the next step in their career.
MCFC,3dz1db,GlassesAndMoustaches,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:07 2015 UTC,Mine says the same thing. So if you work it out I'd love to know.

MCFC,3dwm1n,adamnchow,8,Mon Jul 20 03:32:41 2015 UTC,Wow his posture and style is almost identical to isco's.  If he had a Madrid shirt on im pretty sure I might get them confused.
MCFC,3dwm1n,TheBobbyDude,8,Mon Jul 20 13:47:17 2015 UTC,Was pretty blown away by this kid -- looked entirely comfortable playing with the senior squad. Looks like an absolute future star.
MCFC,3dwm1n,abellwillring,8,Mon Jul 20 14:33:52 2015 UTC,I kept thinking it was Nasri on the ball at times because he looked so comfortable as you say.
MCFC,3dwm1n,shteap,4,Mon Jul 20 14:51:32 2015 UTC,He looks like he could be a good replacement for Silva in a couple of years.
MCFC,3dwm1n,optimusgryme,2,Mon Jul 20 10:03:56 2015 UTC,Very impressive I am sure we will be seeing him this year as a sub hopefully!
MCFC,3dwm1n,HippieHOP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"Looks to have good potential, I watched him closely in the U21 derby at Old Trafford a few months back and he was very poor. We may as well have played with 10 men in that game!"
MCFC,3dwm1n,bryan156,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:43 2015 UTC,To be fair the whole team were poor on that occasion. Huge talent
MCFC,3dwm1n,pjanicbutton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:45 2015 UTC,These players are young and still learning..We cant expect silva like consistency from them..Even if he shows half of silva's consistency when matures..We should be delighted
MCFC,3dwsoc,Later_Haters,6,Mon Jul 20 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"Rumours are that we're using our interest in Alex Sandro as a pawn in the Pogba move, saying we'll give up our pursuit of him so Juve can have him, then we'll announce Fabinho"
MCFC,3dwsoc,SlashmanX,9,Mon Jul 20 07:23:35 2015 UTC,"Personally these types of transfer politics are way too convoluted for me to believe. But if this is how transfers work, it would obviously be too shady to ever end up in public view so who the hell knows. Regardless the process, Fabinho and Pogba would be amazing signings so hopefully they workout."
MCFC,3dwsoc,sexmarshines,6,Mon Jul 20 07:53:36 2015 UTC,Italians love complex transfer dealings though
MCFC,3dxa2c,OllieWillie,22,Mon Jul 20 08:16:04 2015 UTC,I believe we're just in this to jack up the prices for his potential suitors - United and Chelsea.
MCFC,3dxa2c,amxn,13,Mon Jul 20 09:53:00 2015 UTC,God I hope your right.
MCFC,3dxa2c,adnams94,11,Mon Jul 20 10:14:50 2015 UTC,We don't need him
MCFC,3dxa2c,Ruffr3tard,2,Mon Jul 20 08:40:35 2015 UTC,"The priority for him is low but Demichelis is 34, Mangala is still settling in and hopefully Kompany doesn't shit the bed again (I think he will have a good season). Getting him would be a good idea."
MCFC,3dxa2c,Stealthypenguin,9,Mon Jul 20 12:37:28 2015 UTC,Disagree.  He would directly inhibit the growth of Denayer who has world-class potential
MCFC,3dxa2c,mimmotoast,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, what if Denayer isn't ready ? what then, we rely on Demichelis/Mangala/Kompany on the hope that none of them have a season like last."
MCFC,3dxa2c,Stealthypenguin,14,Mon Jul 20 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"That's the risk you gotta take with youngsters, we need to put faith in Denayer that he's ready, he's impressed the past season so he's certainly earned himself some trust. Besides, he'll just be a rotation option, if things don't work out we'll handle it in the January window."
MCFC,3dxa2c,Masterofknees,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:45 2015 UTC,While it's great to think this is what will happen. Zero of the EDS team has broken into the first team. POSSIBLY Lopes in the coming season but literately there has been no one from youth brought into first team at City since Pellegrini took over.
MCFC,3dxa2c,churika,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"This is the first season there has been genuine options available who could benefit the first team. As much as we'd have loved Lopes in the squad last year, or Rekik, hindsight has proven that they wouldn't have been ready. This year Lopes appears ready (and at a crossroads contractually) and Deneyar has developed hugely while at Celtic and is pushing to start. This will be the first time we see academy youth feature more than just the early rounds of the capital one cup. Expect to see Roberts too."
MCFC,3dxa2c,smoshuap0wers,3,Tue Jul 21 06:07:43 2015 UTC,Are we bidding for Otamendi?
MCFC,3dxa2c,rickhelgason,2,Mon Jul 20 08:30:30 2015 UTC,What about Denayer then?
MCFC,3dxa2c,temka1337,4,Mon Jul 20 11:00:16 2015 UTC,If we were to get Otamendi i'd hope he would replace Demi.
MCFC,3dxa2c,gammalman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:33:13 2015 UTC,Dont see why we would do this. Using semi-big money on another CB would seem like a luxury.
MCFC,3dxa2c,ATN5,0,Mon Jul 20 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"He'll probably choose City then. I really believe Van Gaal has some kind of mental issue. Asbergers or a mild form of sociopathic behaviour. Me myself would choose to work with Silva, Yaya, Agüero etc.. And of course The Charming Man."
MCFC,3dx0a0,ishanwelde,13,Mon Jul 20 06:02:58 2015 UTC,You want to know whether to put him into your fantasy football don't you?
MCFC,3dx0a0,shteap,9,Mon Jul 20 14:53:59 2015 UTC,I have been caught.
MCFC,3dx0a0,shteap,5,Mon Jul 20 16:04:38 2015 UTC,My amazing deduction skills are known far and wide.
MCFC,3dx0a0,JimmothyTwinkletoes,3,Mon Jul 20 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Skilled at deduction, you say. Could you do my taxes for me?"
MCFC,3dx0a0,Drthingy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:47:10 2015 UTC,I think (I may be wrong) that him and zab don't start pre season until 3rd August so it's thought they may not be match fit.  Hope I'm wrong-just wish aguero had had a summer of rest!
MCFC,3dx0a0,xx_rudyh_xx,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:30 2015 UTC,I don't see why not

MCFC,3duzo0,joveticc,19,Sun Jul 19 19:04:01 2015 UTC,Fuck me he's more boring than Milner
MCFC,3duzo0,Mr-Pants,14,Sun Jul 19 22:43:15 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that Delph will fly under the radar for the most part as everyone will be focused on Sterling.  Here's hoping he performs like Milner and Barry.
MCFC,3duzo0,iTheRabbitHutch,11,Sun Jul 19 20:20:10 2015 UTC,"I thought that one kid was funny  ""Have you signed?""  ""Yeah just signed pal"""

MCFC,3dtg85,itsyourdestini,28,Sun Jul 19 07:54:11 2015 UTC,Remember the Daily Mail article a few days ago about how Liverpool were going to 'hijack' this deal as 'revenge' for selling Sterling? Uh...
MCFC,3dtg85,sixteen_weasels,23,Sun Jul 19 09:49:52 2015 UTC,"I think we just signed Navas' replacement in a year or two's time. They aren't the exact same type of player, but from the way Roberts has been described as really confident he'll be in our first team eventually, it sounds like he's been told how things will turn out if his development goes to plan.   We could have signed England's two wingers for the majority of the next decade this week."
MCFC,3dtg85,domalino,12,Sun Jul 19 08:04:23 2015 UTC,I know highlight videos are shit but his (minus the music) is pretty goddamn good  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKOkGPi1Wk  I am really happy we signed him
MCFC,3dtg85,thruxton,3,Sun Jul 19 10:12:12 2015 UTC,There were 5/6 moments where I thought the highlight was over because I couldn't imagine what he could've done to get out of it. Wow. Impressive
MCFC,3dtg85,Andtheyrustledsoftly,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:53 2015 UTC,How long do you think it will take before we see him in our first team?
MCFC,3dtg85,GlassesAndMoustaches,3,Sun Jul 19 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, only seen him play once and he was only alright in that game."
MCFC,3dtg85,domalino,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:25 2015 UTC,No worries. Cheers anyway mate!
MCFC,3dtg85,GlassesAndMoustaches,18,Sun Jul 19 19:28:58 2015 UTC,3 homegrown players in one week? Fuck yeah!
MCFC,3dtg85,Ruffr3tard,14,Sun Jul 19 08:10:06 2015 UTC,Will Enes and Patrick ultimately become club grown too? They're both 18 now.
MCFC,3dtg85,Le0nix,11,Sun Jul 19 08:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, as well as Iheanacho too hopefully!"
MCFC,3dtg85,I_am_a_Kite_AMA,2,Sun Jul 19 08:31:42 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Unal was 18 already when he signed right? So he won't count as homegrown because he won't get a full 3 years under 21?"
MCFC,3dtg85,I_MeltUrSnowCone,2,Sun Jul 19 13:06:41 2015 UTC,Will have played 3 seasons with the club before turning 21
MCFC,3dtg85,franpr95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"I believe I've seen people say the current rule is to complete your third season while you're still 21 (before you turn 22), but the FA is trying to change is so that is before you turn 21."
MCFC,3dtg85,r4sale,2,Sun Jul 19 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"The last u21 season is the one you turn 21 in. So if you turn 21 in May 2018 like Unal, he's u21 for the 15/16, 16/17 and 17/18 seasons.  As he'll have been registered to us for all 3 of those seasons he will be HG."

MCFC,3dtg85,dasspacemonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"True, but there wasn't 24/7 Sky news coverage like the other signings, but that's probably because he isn't a prem player"

MCFC,3dtg85,JerobifromATCQ,7,Sun Jul 19 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"So do we think the plan is to take care of the homegrown quota then move on to the likes of KDB, Pogba etc? Surely we have to start off loading some players soon as well."
MCFC,3dtg85,Count_Critic,3,Sun Jul 19 09:32:26 2015 UTC,If we did get KDB i wonder where nasri would fit in...
MCFC,3dtg85,Big_12_incher,19,Sun Jul 19 09:39:48 2015 UTC,The bench
MCFC,3dtg85,Sergiokun,6,Sun Jul 19 10:11:41 2015 UTC,Thats a very expensive bench walmer to have.
MCFC,3dtg85,Big_12_incher,3,Sun Jul 19 15:00:43 2015 UTC,Well I figured Nasri would be moving on anyway. There's still plenty of time left in the transfer window but I'd be disappointed if another big signing wasn't made.
MCFC,3dtg85,Count_Critic,5,Sun Jul 19 10:54:59 2015 UTC,I thought he confirmed he was staying with us this season?
MCFC,3dtg85,Big_12_incher,4,Sun Jul 19 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I guess he did. But that doesn't necessarily mean the club feel the same and there's quite a few players that will either go elsewhere, pull their finger out or sit on the bench for new players and he's one of them."
MCFC,3dtg85,Count_Critic,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:09 2015 UTC,Tbh i dont think he's worth keeping.
MCFC,3dtg85,Big_12_incher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured him, Yaya, Dzeko and unfortunately Jovetic had to be moving on but at the moment it almost seems like none of them will be and I don't see what's changed."

It will be interesting to see what the future holds for him this season. A loan somewhere most likely? Hopefully he'll have first team opportunities soon and he'll make rapid progress in his development."
MCFC,3dtyul,ZidanesLeftBoot,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:16 2015 UTC,Any footage of him?
MCFC,3dtyul,trotsky90,2,Sun Jul 19 15:23:41 2015 UTC,Is anyone else excited for the future?
MCFC,3dtyul,MashedHair,5,Sun Jul 19 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"I've been excited for the future for years now, but none of them have made the first team. Really thought Guidetti would at one point :(  My new hope is that Denayer and Lopes make it."
MCFC,3dtyul,Trosso,3,Sun Jul 19 17:41:11 2015 UTC,Fully agree. I'd personally have a season where we finished 2nd-5th and had a load of our youth players become regulars rather than win the league and none of them play.
MCFC,3dtyul,sixteen_weasels,2,Sun Jul 19 21:55:18 2015 UTC,We've bought a lot of young up and coming strikers recently! Excited to see who works out
MCFC,3dvrm9,joannes3000,28,Sun Jul 19 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"So far the window has been decent, not much more.   Delph is a good squad player, we were the only people interested in sterling and we paid full price. Certainly good business but nothing to really praise Txiki for.   However I say that firmly in the belief that in a fortnights time he will have had the best transfer window of the club's history and Txiki will deserve the credit for that."
MCFC,3dvrm9,domalino,2,Sun Jul 19 23:14:54 2015 UTC,What have you in mind that will happen to make this transfer window the best?
MCFC,3dvrm9,oJacko,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:13 2015 UTC,De Bruyne. We won't get Pogba but KDB is a world class playmaker that would lift our squad to new heights
MCFC,3dvrm9,Andtheyrustledsoftly,3,Mon Jul 20 03:01:17 2015 UTC,that would lift our squad to new heights   He's not better than Silva. Would be a nice addition though.
MCFC,3dvrm9,Itsjofa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:33 2015 UTC,"I never said he was. He's better than Nasri, and both can play at the same time."
MCFC,3dvrm9,Andtheyrustledsoftly,2,Mon Jul 20 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"de bruyne and the biggest signing in the club's history, Paul Pogba"
MCFC,3dvrm9,yegermeister,8,Mon Jul 20 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hasn't really done anything yet.   Signed a player for a lot of money who wanted to leave anyway, a squad player for a relative bargain, and an 18 year old."
MCFC,3dvrm9,poppingfresh,7,Mon Jul 20 00:05:42 2015 UTC,"Nice try, Txiki"
MCFC,3dvrm9,CallMeGrapho,10,Mon Jul 20 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"I really don't think he's done much to deserve lots of praise. Sure I'm happy for Sterling, but everyone in the world knew we had to overpay so he did. Deph is solid, good deal for him, discount price. Only time will tell with Roberts. I think he's done what should be expected at a club of our stature with our resources."
MCFC,3dvrm9,Andtheyrustledsoftly,9,Sun Jul 19 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's had a good plan B. We paid alot for Sterling and his wage is ridiculous, we got Delph for cheap but his wage is ridiculous. What's the backup plan for KDB and Pogba? We don't know and Txiki doesn't either."
MCFC,3dvrm9,Silky_Johnson24,4,Sun Jul 19 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"He's building a next-gen City while we're fuming over signings of Schweinsteiger, Vidal, etc. Patrick Roberts, Enes Unal, Sterling, possibly Pogba, and a lot more youngsters we've singed (French duo, etc).  I believe the best of City is yet to come, we've invested a massive amount on the future. And if the youth are properly prepared then we could be giants for the next 7-8 years (based on our current youth)"
MCFC,3dvrm9,amxn,3,Mon Jul 20 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with amxn below. City are investing in the future and that excites me. I love the Sterling signing because finally FFP restrictions are gone and we can spend all we want. Delph will show to be a good signing as long as he gets the opportunities. I think it has been a good window, even if it ended now.  Txiki is the man"
MCFC,3dvrm9,mcfcnw12,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"thank him for doing his job? its not like txiki thought, you know what ill do these lads a favour..."

MCFC,3dtosw,JTToadOfToadHall,2,Sun Jul 19 12:53:13 2015 UTC,We obviously have a chance. But with so many factors yet to be determined it's almost impossible to guess how strong that chance is. Will be sign KDB and Pogba? United get a striker? Chelsea buy more? Even Arsenal. Plus how will all those players settle. Let alone Vinny and Yaya.
MCFC,3dtosw,temka1337,4,Sun Jul 19 13:38:39 2015 UTC,yea I was referring to the rags as 'them'
MCFC,3dtosw,GlassesAndMoustaches,36,Sun Jul 19 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"At least six times I will be furious with Yaya's performance, complain all game that he's done nothing, then as we're 0-0 down to Villa with 12 minutes to go he'll run 70 yards and score. I'll proceed to laugh, be torn between emotions, and beg for him to do that week in week out  I'm not jinxing our season with a table finish. I'll just wait and see, like usual.."

MCFC,3dtosw,Sweep89,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:36 2015 UTC,I think if they continue with Theo up front and he doesn't get injured (big if) they'll do very well. They played excellent football last season and with Cech between the sticks they are scary. I think they'll make a big signing though.
MCFC,3dtosw,martodve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think the title will be a hard fight between the 4 you mentioned. The only reason Chelsea were so superior is that Arsenal, United an us didn't get off to a great start in the first half of the season and they had a great one. And yeah I do not see Liverpool doing well next year, maybe Benteke will light them up but as of now I can't really see it. Interesting with Crystal Palace? Why do you think that?"
MCFC,3dtosw,pezd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"Palace have a lot of pace and with the addition of Cabaye have a strong midfield. If they get either Austin or Remy they will be a serious force. The end of last season under Pardew they were brilliant and I can see them starting really well, it's just whether they cam keep it up."
MCFC,3dtosw,JimmothyTwinkletoes,9,Mon Jul 20 09:12:01 2015 UTC,"The title will either be ours, the rags' or Chelsea's. It won't be won easily. We can win both cups if Pellegrini decides to field strong squads for them. I dare not predict anything about the CL, but I'm hoping for big improvement from our best run(s) to date."
MCFC,3dtosw,pezd,5,Sun Jul 19 12:14:44 2015 UTC,I think arsenal have a really good shot this year if they buy a striker and strengthen defence a touch
MCFC,3dtosw,JimmothyTwinkletoes,10,Sun Jul 19 12:18:45 2015 UTC,I think Arsenal have a better shot than United. Schweinstager-Schniderlin-Herrea midfield doesn't scare me and our front 3 outclasses their front three as it is right now. Alexis at Arsenal is a game changer and if they get Lacazette they would be a very dangerous team.
MCFC,3dtosw,Masterofknees,4,Sun Jul 19 13:28:40 2015 UTC,Lacazette just confirmed he's saying at Lyon. Benzema / Higuain more likely.
MCFC,3dtosw,mcityftw,4,Sun Jul 19 13:38:41 2015 UTC,Benzema would be just as dangerous as Lacazette but Real would fight tooth and nail to pry Agüero away from us were they to lose Benz. Higuain would provide many a laugh with his tendency to flub up in the biggest moments but would still be an upgrade ofer Giroud. Cavani would be a scary striker for them to have but Arsenal doesn't like to spend enough to get him.
MCFC,3dtosw,franpr95,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"I just don't believe that Arsenal will do anything out of the norm, for so many years they haven't been able to perform when it matters the most, I don't see a few signings changing that as they've already had plenty of capable squads that have choked, it's a deeper rooted issue in the club. I think they'll finish 4th, and they'll probably be closer to Liverpool than United."

Our squad has improved, and I hope Pelle has learned a lesson in diversifying his strategy.

MCFC,3drht1,amxn,12,Sat Jul 18 19:23:41 2015 UTC,Doesn't change Vidal -> Bayern which I think is the biggest thing now.
MCFC,3drht1,l2ighty,5,Sat Jul 18 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"With the players Juve have brought in even if we sign Pogba they will still be better off than last year. Especially if they get Götze like has been rumored. If we put Jovetic into the Pogba deal they will be quite well off. Dybala and Llorente coming in along with Khedira on a free and Berardi on loan will do very well to offset losing Tevez, Pirlo, Vidal, and potentially Pogba.   Also, they still made the UCL final and closed out the league with Pogba out with an injury until the last couple games. I think he missed the UCL Quarter and Semi finals. Selling him would still make sense for them especially if they get their €100m asking price as I can't see him becoming worth much more."
MCFC,3drht1,JimmothyTwinkletoes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:39:27 2015 UTC,Why would Gotze go to Juventus? What have I missed?
MCFC,3drht1,Trosso,19,Sun Jul 19 08:42:25 2015 UTC,"The Pogba deal never relied on anything at all happening at Barcelona. It just relies on Juve accepting our bid, always has been the case. Everything else is mostly sorted (except image rights I think)"
MCFC,3drht1,SlashmanX,15,Sat Jul 18 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"Partially. Pogba wanted a Barca move, Laporta said he'll bring him over if he won (given his clout in the transfer market, he usually does).  But yes, I do agree all of this comes into play only if Juve let him leave."
MCFC,3drht1,rED_L1ne,6,Sat Jul 18 19:28:13 2015 UTC,Still doubt it given Vidal's departure
MCFC,3drht1,temka1337,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:43 2015 UTC,Well it certainly won't hurt our chances of landing Pogba.
MCFC,3drht1,Captluck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to make of this. But I certainly think this is better than Laporta winning, although I'm not at all sure how much better it really is."
MCFC,3drht1,rickhelgason,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:15:08 2015 UTC,I think it's unlikely that he will come this summer. Juve will probably keep him through the Euro's at least. However... never say never. Would definitely love it if he joins us.
MCFC,3drht1,_dont_care,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:33 2015 UTC,This development is good in a way because it negates the possibility of Barce chasing Pogba (or so it would appear).   The only thing that actually matters is that one Pogba is interested (I believe he is) and two that Juve would consider selling.  If anything maybe our 25% chance of signing Pogba has become 40%; you get my drift...  We will pay whatever it takes to get him. I don't think you will see a bid go in for him unless we have concrete evidence it will be accepted as opposed to Sterling. If we get a bid accepted you can be assured Pogba will be a City player because that side of things will or even already has been discussed.
MCFC,3drht1,boison024,0,Sat Jul 18 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we won't pay whatever it takes.  We won't pay the 71 million price that juve are asking, and that is what gets him here.  IMO his transfer is much more straightforward and we should be going for him before de Bruyne."

MCFC,3dqm0a,k34ts,9,Sat Jul 18 14:37:27 2015 UTC,Daily Mail saying £2m that could rise to £8m. So plenty of numbers out there being thrown around. I remember initial figures rumored were around £10m

MCFC,3dqm0a,optimusgryme,-11,Sat Jul 18 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"You're dubious about Sterling but you've accepted Delph? Lol Delph is utter shit, Sterling at least actually has talent, even if he cost a lot."
MCFC,3dqm0a,zzonked7,7,Sat Jul 18 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"Delph is young, English, and good playing box to box. That's exactly something we needed, HG quota plus a quality back up for cheap. Who's to say he won't fit well with us and develop nicely?"
MCFC,3dqm0a,optimusgryme,-12,Sat Jul 18 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"Do you really think players develop much after 25? 25 is not young either. Name me one player that has changed significantly since they were 25. It rarely happens, if ever. Delph is at the level he will always be at now.   I disagree about him being good box to box. He's okay going forward (just about) but his defense is below average.   I agree that he's English though. That is the only reason he's a City player."
MCFC,3dqm0a,zzonked7,3,Sat Jul 18 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"Didier Drogba for one but he wouldn't be a great example seeing as he starte later. Delph is young compare to the test of our squad. It's well known that we had the oldest average starting squad age in European comps last season other than Fiorentina, so to me 25 is plenty young. He'll play the role Lamps did, and he'll be driven to prove himself after his mess of a transfer. Excited to see what he ca do for us."
MCFC,3dqm0a,ArkLuno,2,Sat Jul 18 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"""Players don't develop past 25""....riiiiiiiiiiiight. Most players best ever seasons are when they are older than 25. Aguero, Toure, Silva, Milner, Zaba. Seems you need to get back to reality son."
MCFC,3dqm0a,zzonked7,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:01:58 2015 UTC,"So because a player has a better season after 25, that means they've improved their ability? That's just not true. Most of those players have had the same level of ability since 25, just because they've had better seasons doesn't mean they've become different players, it just means they've been more consistent with the same level of talent or perhaps just bedded into the team better, been given a more prominent role etc..  Pretty much every player you named were already considered top quality at age 25 and that opinion hasn't changed much. I want you to name one like Fabian Delph. Someone who was battling it out at a relegation team and considered maybe slightly above average, then suddenly moved to a top team aged 25 or older and became world class.  By 25 players are what they are. The easiest way for me to prove this is just waiting and coming back to this when Delph is sold in 2 years."

MCFC,3dqmxu,iTheRabbitHutch,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"Well if its true that he was told Benteke wouldn't be sold and he believed it, he didn't really think too hard.   The release clause is public knowledge; Villa could promise until the cows come home however, if somebody meets that clause it doesn't make a blind bit of difference what they promised.  Probably what happened is how Delph explained it; the night before he has gone to bed and couldn't get it out of his mind and made a rash decision; he has then had time to think about it without pressure and made a more rational and informed decision.  He is human after all and I think we have all been there when you can't see the wood for the trees.  If I was a Villa fan, yeh I'd be very upset but at the end of the day you can't blame him for choosing what is a fantastic opportunity."
MCFC,3dqmxu,_dont_care,8,Sat Jul 18 23:59:09 2015 UTC,I think the reaction he has got is justified. He shouldn't have come out and said what he did. His reasons for joining are perfectly valid and I've not seen any Villa fan really slate him for that. It's the double u-turn that's done him.

MCFC,3dq29n,Masterofknees,13,Sat Jul 18 11:03:37 2015 UTC,"It will have almost certainly been his agent. Who would want their client responding to direct questions about transfer speculation?  He hasn't ruled out staying at Wolfsburg and he has a number of clubs, including City, interested in him. It would do him absolutely no good to say ""yes I want to join City"" or ""no I don't want to join City"", so he has no reason to comment.  It's a bit of a non-story to be honest, a player refusing to comment on a transfer rumour is nothing new."
MCFC,3dq29n,joebutters,9,Sat Jul 18 11:35:09 2015 UTC,I agree that that is a good sign that we are at least in some way acting on him.

So even if he goes into the EDS he won't be taking a step back.   It also seems he is very confident of eventually getting game time...could be getting lined up to replace Navas in a year or two."
MCFC,3dq7hk,domalino,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"He's one of the brightest young English prospects who had about a year left on his contract at Fulham.  It's not necessarily to do with homegrown quota, although it would help. It's more getting him in before he properly bursts onto the scene.  I also think it was conceded that increasing the homegrown quota is going to be rejected by the majority of Premier League clubs, so it won't be a reality."

MCFC,3dquco,pjanicbutton,4,Sat Jul 18 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"Really hits the nail on the head. Lots of scrutiny for Delph and Sterling recently, especially from the media. But the reality is that they want to join us because of the attraction and the opportunities available."
MCFC,3dquco,SirDinnertable,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"He's not wrong about Liverpool and Villa trading in on past glories, especially Liverpool.   Every week on Sky Sports you get Graham Souness talking about how Liverpool will dominate, and how they are the better side, but they haven't won the league since 1990.  If you want to equate this to real life, imagine getting a job out of school, and over the next 3 or 4 years getting really good at what you do, but not really progressing anywhere. Then, a larger company comes knocking and says ""we're going to triple your wages and give you better opportunities for career advancement."" You'd bite their hand off to take that at 20."
MCFC,3dpswg,GlassesAndMoustaches,18,Sat Jul 18 07:12:10 2015 UTC,That new shirt is fucking gorgeous
MCFC,3dpswg,sfida95,9,Sat Jul 18 07:20:26 2015 UTC,It looks specially great on black players. Bony and sterling look amazing in them.
MCFC,3dpswg,Vizzeh,5,Sat Jul 18 07:26:58 2015 UTC,Did you see the jacket sterling was wearing in the video of his first day at the club? I love it. Looked brilliant on him.  Here's a link http://shop.mcfc.co.uk/stores/mancity/en/product/manchester-city-authentic-n98-jacket-sky-blue/161220

Last season was iffy but this season's home kit seems positive.   But yes I still want Umbro back"
MCFC,3dpswg,domalino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:40:32 2015 UTC,I just wish they would leave the home shorts white. That's the look everyone prefers and it shouldn't change. Experiment with small details and the away/third kits.

MCFC,3dpswg,chirstopher0us,5,Sat Jul 18 07:42:54 2015 UTC,Haha thanks. Happy birthday!
MCFC,3dpswg,sheikhspeareinlove,2,Sat Jul 18 07:56:58 2015 UTC,Cheers mate!
MCFC,3dpswg,domalino,3,Sat Jul 18 07:59:16 2015 UTC,Hopefully we see a lot more of it.
MCFC,3dpswg,sheikhspeareinlove,6,Sat Jul 18 07:32:36 2015 UTC,Shakey as hell though. Several times we've got a winger rushing up the right looking for the overlap and no one's there.
MCFC,3dpswg,sixteen_weasels,3,Sat Jul 18 07:39:20 2015 UTC,To be fair it would work better if we had Sterling Aguero and Silva instead.
MCFC,3dpswg,Count_Critic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:09:49 2015 UTC,"So far it looks like the basic shape has two midfielders holding in a double pivot behind the CAM, and Yaya has freedom to run further forward out of the holding spot when the chance arises. I think that's the ideal setup for our midfield. Let a Fern focus on defense, but keep the double pivot so we can play Silva as the CAM and either Nasri or (Please please) KDB on the left wing.  Edit: eh, Yaya's moving around a lot. It's almost like having a designated CAM, a designated CDM, and Yaya doing whatever he likes on the middle-right. I'd already like to see a little better defensive effort from him."
MCFC,3dpswg,yegermeister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:41:52 2015 UTC,Its weird that Barker is so central though. Him and Nasri have been occupying the same space. Manu has also been the holde so its looked like a 4231 at times too
MCFC,3dpswg,Count_Critic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think it's working well at all with barker playing up front.   I'd either take nasri off for iheanacho/unal   Or take Garcia off, try nasri in the midfield 3, and bring on iheanacho or unal.   Give barker 45 minutes in his preferred position."
MCFC,3dpswg,yegermeister,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:15:23 2015 UTC,Immediately better on the left. Think its time to sub in a striker though
MCFC,3dpswg,sixteen_weasels,10,Sat Jul 18 08:36:12 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Melbourne City's goalkeeper Tando Velaphi is a Japanese-Zimbabwean-Australian.

MCFC,3dpswg,imwatters,7,Sat Jul 18 07:23:55 2015 UTC,(Mostly good-natured?) booing when Sterling is shown on the big screen. So it begins.

MCFC,3dpswg,m9321,7,Sat Jul 18 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I think Navas shot with his weak foot. I don't think I've ever seen him use it let alone shoot with it."
MCFC,3dpswg,abellwillring,7,Sat Jul 18 07:55:43 2015 UTC,I think sterling is really going to pressure Navas to improve to keep his playing time. He seems much better today.
MCFC,3dpswg,cptz3r0,3,Sat Jul 18 08:02:12 2015 UTC,"You see Navas getting into good, dangerous positions. You don't see him finishing the chance or picking out a great pass in the box. That's what Sterling and Nasri have over him."
MCFC,3dpswg,Captluck,7,Sat Jul 18 08:03:44 2015 UTC,"Toure seems to be enjoying himself, hopefully someone can finish off one of our nice attacking moves in the second half."

MCFC,3dpswg,nalsubaie,12,Sat Jul 18 08:25:29 2015 UTC,Booing Sterling at a City game against Melbourne on the Gold Coast?

MCFC,3dqdl4,domalino,2,Sat Jul 18 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"But he tried to sign Beckham, who turned them down for Real.   If the same thing happened he would try to sign pogba...who wouldn't turn them down.   More likely IMO is that pogba goes to barca if laporta wins, he comes to us if bartomeu wins."
MCFC,3dqdl4,SenorOrgasmo,0,Sat Jul 18 16:38:28 2015 UTC,Maybe he wouldn't want to spend £71m on someone who wouldn't add much more quality to the squad? Or maybe he doesn't think they need a starting midfielder rather squad players. For a squad that's just done the treble he may see 100m Euros spent or saved better elsewhere
MCFC,3dqdl4,boison024,11,Sat Jul 18 13:39:34 2015 UTC,Those are some big assumptions.

MCFC,3dpyag,2watty,8,Sat Jul 18 08:38:11 2015 UTC,"We dont need to replace dzeko/jovetic with sterling/unal/nacho coming in.  I'm assuming, we'll throw everything on de bruyne now and get him but overpay aswell.  I'd love if we went for Ricardo Rodriguez aswell. Maybe £71m for Rodriguez and de Bruyne?"
MCFC,3dpyag,cptz3r0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:46:33 2015 UTC,Not really seen Rodriguez but wouldn't grumble with a left back being signed
MCFC,3dpyag,SlashmanX,6,Sat Jul 18 09:39:18 2015 UTC,"The Pogba deal isn't off.   If we're playing with 1 striker in a 4-3-3 then I think Aguero,  Bony and Nacho/Unal would be enough, with Sterling being able to play there if needed"
MCFC,3dpyag,Masterofknees,0,Sat Jul 18 09:39:56 2015 UTC,"Nothing announced,  but IMO it appears off, he wants to go to barca, juve don't want to sell and we've signed Delph. And he's massively overpriced."
MCFC,3dpyag,JimmothyTwinkletoes,8,Sat Jul 18 09:51:25 2015 UTC,"Delph was a replacement for Lampard. It looks like we'll be playing 4-3-3 next season, so another midfielder is needed regardless."
MCFC,3dpyag,JGucci_,3,Sat Jul 18 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"Also, Delph and Pogba are far from the same player. Sure, they're both midfielders but that's about where the comparison ends."
MCFC,3dpyag,I_am_a_Kite_AMA,4,Sat Jul 18 13:03:37 2015 UTC,I kinda want us to bring Isco from Madrid. Just watched him against Roma and yet again the kid proves he's world class.
MCFC,3dpyag,chirstopher0us,2,Sat Jul 18 11:28:24 2015 UTC,"Isco is my dream signing, such a fantastic player"
MCFC,3dpyag,MashedHair,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"Only if we don't sign KDB, right? Otherwise there's nowhere to play him."
MCFC,3dpyag,TheBobbyDude,2,Sun Jul 19 05:00:18 2015 UTC,I think we're fine. We have 2 strikers of absolute quality. Sterling in a pinch and plenty of youth chomping at the bit for a sniff of a chance.    I don't think we need to buy so I hope we don't spend just for the sake of spending.
MCFC,3dpyag,loics,0,Sat Jul 18 08:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'd just feel better if we had another proven striker on the books, I'd even be tempted to offer £15m for Austin. Remember with all competitions we'll play over 50 games this season"
MCFC,3doc6g,josepht1002,36,Fri Jul 17 22:25:26 2015 UTC,Can we not post shit tier banter like this.
MCFC,3doc6g,Citeh,17,Sat Jul 18 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"If that's what user of this sub prefer then sure. Just a little curious as to why? Its not like were posting this on main or soccer  City fans are classy and I like that, but its still a sports team, why not have a but of a laugh amongst ourselves, make fun of the competition. Day after day I keep checking in and its stressful discussions about the market and underperforming players.  I get that we want the club to perform, but why not put some light hearted stuff so we can have a good laugh from time to time.   I do live in the US, and maybe things are a but different in Manchester."
MCFC,3doc6g,sexmarshines,15,Sat Jul 18 02:17:05 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Idk what's with the hard asses that don't enjoy some light banter lol
MCFC,3doc6g,semogn,4,Sat Jul 18 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"It's shite banter, the shite bit being the problem. I looked at it as a blue and cringed. Players who never made it at city, players signed 6 years earlier. I like a laugh. But at least put some effort in."

MCFC,3doc6g,ymmot1101,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:52:39 2015 UTC,Yea man. I hate when new fans join anything I've been a part of. Like fer real. If someone does not have the same background or opportunity that I have yet attempts to be part of something I usually figure out a way to distinguish myself as superior and then hate on them.  So far I've never had to deal with how empty my life is or how I need to put others down to feel better about myself. Yay!
MCFC,3doc6g,ymmot1101,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:05 2015 UTC,"You know you're a plastic fan, you probably have about 4 different favourite teams."
MCFC,3doc6g,ymmot1101,0,Tue Jul 21 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"You are a plastic fan, you probably are in 5th grade and... you probably are a United fan who just switched to City because they suck and... You probably don't know much about soccer and... You probably never heard of City before 2008 and you probably...  Omg I'm having soo much fun coming up with soo many probabilities that I know nothing about nor can I verify!!  Yay!

MCFC,3doc6g,nutburger_,0,Tue Jul 21 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"Last week, I noticed a bunch of new guys come support my local team. At first I was like, wow this is great my clubs fan base which is growing which in turn means more revenue and the global presence of my team will soon be at the level of the other big wigs.   But idk what happened, I walked up to the new fans and threw my pop corn at them and said GET OUT OF HERE!!! I WAS HERE FIRST! THIS TEAM ONLY LOVES ME AND NOT YOU GUYS!..then I walked away...but before I left I turned around one more time and said...""I don't want any new fans and supporters to share in my teams growth, I want all the glory of the team for myself..you stupid new fans who are clearly glory hunters""."
MCFC,3doc6g,blatom75,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:41 2015 UTC,...you clearly are a gloryhunter. Why are you trying to deny it?
MCFC,3doc6g,Vetro777,0,Tue Jul 21 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"Woah, wtf man. Were you one of those guys I threw pop corn at, that's what I said to them, right after they called me out on my ignorance. I just made that statement and walked away. Like I realized I was wrong, but I just wanted to dismiss them instead of having to respond to what they were saying. Mostly because it was much easier to just dismiss them as a person than rationalize my foolish thought  Sorry man, my actions were dumb."

MCFC,3doc6g,gosha1988,-47,Sat Jul 18 16:10:22 2015 UTC,You have bought almost 50 players since 2008 and spent over 700M pounds. Show me anybody who spent more for the same period?
MCFC,3doc6g,gosha1988,15,Fri Jul 17 23:26:52 2015 UTC,The only thing you'll be shown is the door
MCFC,3doc6g,Fraz0R_Raz0R,18,Sat Jul 18 00:16:19 2015 UTC,2008 was quite a while ago
MCFC,3doc6g,gosha1988,-25,Fri Jul 17 23:40:24 2015 UTC,Sure. So you picked one major purchase last year and compared to cheapest ones you have made. Totally makes sense
MCFC,3doc6g,l2ighty,28,Fri Jul 17 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, of course City spent a lot in the beginning. Coming from very humble means, that's what it took to catch up to the big wigs.   On that note thank you for clarifying something, spending 700mil helped City catch up and dethrone united while Ferguson was still around. This after always being the inferior neglected club. Just 700mil is what it took City to compensate for being outspent for 30 some years?   Today United is outspending City (this and last season). I see no return to the top for United. United will never be able to do what City did and the way they did it. City is a well managed club and organization, from the bottom to the top, and that is 1 more reason why I am a fan.   See ya on the rear view next season pal ;)"

MCFC,3dnka4,p7r,13,Fri Jul 17 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"His farewell interview was heart breaking. You can see how much he wanted to prove himself, but he was unlucky and injuries hampered his progress"

MCFC,3dnka4,imhotep22,6,Sat Jul 18 01:14:39 2015 UTC,QPR at home was great this year because of the crowd's reaction to Shauny Wright and Dunne.
MCFC,3dnka4,titykaka,8,Sat Jul 18 02:04:32 2015 UTC,Good lad Micah. And there were rumours that he bended his ear in the other direction.

MCFC,3dnka4,temka1337,7,Fri Jul 17 20:35:31 2015 UTC,On the stadium tour there's (or there was recently) a small room dedicated entirely to Micah's City career.  Being in there and knowing that he was likely to leave at the end of the season was a real downer.

MCFC,3dnka4,ATN5,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:54 2015 UTC,As a villa fan I can say you've got yourself a great addition to the squad if Delph can recreate the form he's shown over the past 2 seasons. Will be interesting to see if he can recreate the form in a team full of top players.  He deserves a chance at the top but I hope he knows the way he left us was so disrespectful after stating his loyalty only the week before. I feel bad for the kids that got his name on the back of their new villa shirts on the back of last week's statement!   It's sad to see my favourite villa player go in such a way but good luck Delph - you'll need it when you come back to villa park!
