Never had a hit single, never had a best selling album, but you talk to people in county music, and they will tell you, Townes Van Zandt was the greatest of them all. Townes suffered from a series of drug addictions and alcoholism. When young, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and insulin shock therapy erased much of his long-term memory. Townes died in 1997, a result of his life long substance abuse problems. This son, ""Pancho and Lefty"", may be his best know song, covered by Emmy Louharris first, then later to greater success by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard.

Timber Timbre is a lovely band from Canada that has a very cinematic feel to their music. Usually it has a somewhat creepy atmosphere, with the lyrics circling around obsession, love-gone-wrong and stalker-like imagery.  I just recently saw them live and they put on a great show, though especially this song was played considerably more ""rocking"", taking away the atmosphere a bit. Still a lot of fun though!  If you are interested into this band, I also recommend songs like Lay Down in the Tall Grass, Grand Canyon and the ever-sexy  Hot Dreams."

Musicthemetime,3dod4b,Mackncheeze,2,Fri Jul 17 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"This isn't my favorite KOL record, but it is the first one I heard. This song has a lot of the sound from the previous couple of albums on it, which I dig. They became one of my favorite bands years after this came out."
Musicthemetime,3dnzk3,killerbunnyfamily,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:08 2015 UTC,I must confess that video was quite shocking for a 13 years old me.

This is probably Green Jellÿ's (aka Green Jello) second most famous song, after Three Little Pigs."

Musicthemetime,3dnixl,DearbornChesterfield,3,Fri Jul 17 18:39:39 2015 UTC,I seriously bought this on CD because of the album art.
Musicthemetime,3dn6sf,lionkin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:10:10 2015 UTC,"I distinctly remember being in grade 8 and this song drawing a divide between our class. You were either a ""rocker"" or a ""rapper"" and if you were a ""rapper"" like myself, this was your anthem."

When submitting your song, please include some information in the comments, like you're a radio DJ introducing it. For example: A bit of history about the song; What the song means to you personally (e.g. where you first heard it, something that happened to you while you were listening to it, what it reminds you of); The lyrics; How it's relevant to today's theme (if that's not readily apparent); Or anything else that might get people interested!"

Musicthemetime,3dmopo,BreakingInReverse,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"I first heard this song while my sister was horseback riding. I was sitting, looking at some albums to download since I could get them for free. I really enjoyed it and the rest of the album.  I'm only now realizing that I put in the wrong title. It's ""Electric Spider"" I think my phone got pissy with me.  EDIT: XKCD Substitutions is fucking with me."

Musicthemetime,3dmc9u,Der_Franz_Kanadishe,3,Fri Jul 17 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"This was released about  year before I turned thirteen. I was a big math nerd and earned the nickname Einstein because of my frizzy afro hair. I was looking to redefine myself. My older brother was really into ""scremo"" and he showed me FFTL.  I thought if I showed that I liked screaming alternative music people would no longer see me as a the smart kid but more like a guy not to fuck with.    And although I liked most of their song, Emily was my favourite. I never admitted to any one that would listen to it. I learned it on guitar and played it for myself only. I was  really scared people wpuld see me as a softie.   The sound of his sincere voice, how much it seams to hurt him go go through expressing his love and want for Émilie.  It's the first song I fell in love with."
Musicthemetime,3dmbxl,AhrmiintheUnseen,2,Fri Jul 17 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"Tristam is a Canadian EDM artist, focusing mainly on the drumstep, electro, and moombahcore (?) genres. I Remember is a relatively old track of his, and he has grown a lot in recent years. I definitely encourage everyone and anyone to at least try out his newer tracks, in particular Far Away and My Friend. Both are truly beautiful songs, and even if you don't like EDM generally, I think the lyrics stand on their own.   Also holy shit some of you are old."
Musicthemetime,3dmbxl,ceegee1975,3,Fri Jul 17 13:00:43 2015 UTC,"One day, you will be too! :) Far Away is nice, makes me think of a coldplay/Main Street Electrical Parade theme mash-up. Yes, we had the record."
Musicthemetime,3dmbxl,ceegee1975,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, Far Away does kinda sound like that theme. What did you think of My Friend? I'm curious to hear what someone older with vividly different tastes to me thinks of it."
Musicthemetime,3dlxv1,nato138,3,Fri Jul 17 09:55:15 2015 UTC,It's easy to diss Limp Bizkit now but at the time this single came out these guys were unstoppable.

Musicthemetime,3dkjjc,lovecreamcheese,6,Fri Jul 17 01:02:35 2015 UTC,Yes!! This is one of the first things I figured out how to tape on the VCR but I still stayed up for it. I still remember watching the premiere of Head Like a Hole live.
