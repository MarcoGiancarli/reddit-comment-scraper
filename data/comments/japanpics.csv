japanpics,3e55k4,PlatinumMinatour,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"Wife and I did a road trip through Tohoku. IIRC, we took the shinkansen to Sendai station, the drove to Mt. Zao, Sendai, Matsushima, Tashirojima, Hiraizumi, ... ? ..., Miyako, Ryusendo Cave, Hachimantai Park, Tazawako (Nyuto Onsen) and Morioka to catch the train back to Tokyo. I think it was 4 nights in total.  It was two years after the earthquake and work was offering 60k yen if you spent 3 nights vacation in the Tohoku area, investing in their economy.  Edit: Also, isn't Hiraizumi, the ""Kyoto of the north"" or something like that? I assumed it was a popular travel destination."
japanpics,3e55k4,PlatinumMinatour,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:31:43 2015 UTC,"Most of the people I spoke to knew of the place, but had never been. I did a similar road trip which is how we ended up visiting.  How was Ryusendo? I meant to go but we ran out of time"

japanpics,3dyy7s,caldera15,3,Mon Jul 20 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"random question. Why is it that pictures of Japan always show stairwells on the outdoors? In America they are usually on the inside. I really like the aesthetics but have always wondered if there was something more to it. Excellent pic, btw."
japanpics,3dyy7s,Fuzzyphilosopher,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:34 2015 UTC,AS fire escapes they might prevent suffocation from smoke inhalation  and perhaps the outer wall provides a greater firewall?   Or it could just be a hold over from earlier building traditions. I'd love to hear from someone who knows about fires and evacuations in high rise buildings about this issue.
japanpics,3dyy7s,DenjinJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I'd heard that in the West, external fire escapes are how it used to be done, but no longer... Now, typically it'll be a separate, enclosed space with nothing flammable in it, which is why you see so many really spartan stairwells inside buildings of the last few decades.  I'm not sure what the safety concern was that shifted it over, though with ones like in the picture, I can imagine a lot of people would be too scared to go out onto them even if there was a fire. Also, maybe burglary was an issue, even with the ones that retract the bottom stairs with a weight."

japanpics,3dc5rs,Pipinpadiloxacopolis,3,Wed Jul 15 09:31:00 2015 UTC,"I was at Himeji Castle today!  It actually has 7 levels.  Two of them are concealed; there's a basement floor and another hidden between the ""4th"" and ""5th"".  I think it's fairly standard to ""hide"" a floor; I was at Matsumoto Castle a month ago and it appears to only have 5 levels, like Himeji, but it actually has 6.  I don't know if there is a castle that has 6 visible floors.  I'm looking at my photos of Osaka Castle and it might?  That's a reconstruction, however, while Himeji and Matsumoto are originals.  EDIT: Himeji is considered to be ""the"" castle of Japan.  A much larger portion of the area within the inner moat is intact when compared to other surviving castles (Matsumoto is basically just the castle keep now).  It's just finished a 6 year restoration project (""Heisei Era Restoration"") and is much whiter now than even this picture.  It was uncovered in March of this year."

japanpics,3bc7v6,mooshoepork,2,Sun Jun 28 06:49:09 2015 UTC,"Sapporo felt unlike any Japanese city I'd been to before in that there was so much SPACE!  It almost felt like I was back home in California - there were huge parking lots, big streets, no tiny alleyways...  But other than stopping through there to go visit some awesome Hokkaido nature, I don't see myself going out of my way to return there.    The X100T was amazing.  I bought it just before the trip and it was everything I've been wanting in a travel camera - lightweight, simple, excellent quality images.  The ability to transfer photos wirelessly to my ipad so I could edit them on the fly was super awesome."
japanpics,3bc7v6,mooshoepork,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:47:07 2015 UTC,I did the same with my X100T in Japan last year. The wifi is awesome.  I really want to go to Sapporo when it's snowing. If only for a few days.

japanpics,3b2utl,WCMaxi,0,Fri Jun 26 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"Humm... this is tricky. Sho Shibata is one of the finest landscape shooters we have here. I don't really feel it is justified to change his vision. He knowingly shot is the way he did, with very deliberate intent. The story of the shot may still reveal itself.  Either way, changing the artist's vision without consulting him/her is perhaps a little questionable."
japanpics,3b2utl,AncientPC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:40:05 2015 UTC,"Do people consult original authors when doing derivative works? I'm not trying to pass this off as my own, we're just discussing composition.  I don't know who Sho Shibata is, but let's use Ansel Adams as a proxy. We're talking, and your reply is ""It's an Ansel Adams, you can't change an Ansel Adams."" That's deferring to authority / legacy without even questioning the merit of a discussion.  Most artists (and enthusiasts) learn the rules, then learn when to break them. The famous photographers often develop a signature style. Whether or not a style appeals to you is often subjective.  How can we have a productive debate by deferring to authority?"
japanpics,3b2utl,WCMaxi,0,Sat Jun 27 07:57:53 2015 UTC,"I think your argument is trying to distract the point. This is his work, not your's. Is it ethical to change an artist's vision merely because you think it's not good enough?   I'd say you can't catch an Adams because it's not your's to change. If you want that shot in a different way, go make it yourself."

He directed us to the red light district which was interesting to walk through...

One thing I will say about the area is that I initially turned the wrong direction from the station. After a few minutes of walking, I realized my error, and was really struck by the poverty.   I believe it has the dubious distinction of having the highest crime rate in all of Japan? I could be mistaken.  I think I need to go back and spend some more time in Osaka.

Yea, there is lots of homeless there and just a bit out of the way and it's clear the see.    And I think I remember something about the crime rate there, but overall I never really felt afraid or threatened.  My friend and I were completely lost tryin to find our hostel and ended up getting escorted by like 8 older Japanese men.  Pretty sure they were part of Yakuza or some other shady stuff, but they were incredibly friendly and nice to us.   Osaka I liked quite a bit.  While it's not the most exciting there are lots of cool little shrines and temples to visit and some pretty good food once you can find it.  And for the people, I don't think we ran into any problems really.  Everyone we came across was incredibly friendly and helpful when we needed it."

japanpics,390yvg,reol7x,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:56:19 2015 UTC,"Chiiori:       Chiiori (篪庵 ?, House of the Flute) is the name of an Edo period minka farmhouse in the Iya Valley, western Tokushima, Japan. Purchased by Alex Kerr in the 1970s, the house is now home to staff members of Chiiori Trust, a non-profit organization based in Iya Valley that is working toward solutions to the problems surrounding depopulation in rural Japan.  From 1997 to 2007, Kerr shared ownership of Chiiori with Mason Florence. However, in summer of 2007, Kerr bought back Florence's share and has since managed the house along with volunteers and Chiiori Trust staff.

japanpics,390yvg,fotografritz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit harder to get to. I've been there twice, once we hired a car and drove from Osaka and the other time I flew into Takamatsu with Jetstar and caught a train into the Iya Valley where my friend picked me up.   Trains are hard. They don't have an IC Card like Passmo or Suica. Actually I bought completely the wrong ticket and the station where I got off, the driver was collecting tickets so I totally held up the train. I'd say if going a fair distance by train ask the midori no madoguchi staff what ticket you need, write down the place name if you have to. Otherwise, driving is highly reccomended as trains are inconvenient.   There are some English speakers around. Most foreigners on the island are JETs. A couple of the white water rafting places in the Iya Valley have English speaking guides- totally go rafting here, it's worth it."

I'm super perplexed by this, as I'm planning to take some twilight city shots of Tokyo when I go in July.  I guess you just went around the observation deck, left the settings locked as you went around? How many shots did it take stitched together? And did you have any issues with damage/scratches in the glass? Tripod? Was it crowded, long queue?"
japanpics,38sve4,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,2,Sat Jun 6 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"I actually had the camera on aperture priority mode, it took about 15 minutes to get all the photos and I wanted to make sure that I had equal exposure values. I just put my lens right flush with the glass, avoiding as many scratches as possible and asking politely for people to give me a second at the window they were at. I think this was 20+ shots in total, but I could have probably gotten away with less. Took one picture out of every window lol... No tripod, I use a 5D III so I was able to get about 1/20"" - 1/8"" exposures at ISO1600. Pressing the camera against the glass really helps to stabilize, even when shooting with one hand as I did for many of the shots."

japanpics,38gq4p,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 4 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"Tilt–shift photography:       Tilt–shift photography is the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras, and sometimes specifically refers to the use of tilt for selective focus, often for simulating a miniature scene.  Sometimes the term is used when the large depth of field is simulated with digital post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt–shift lens) normally required when the effect is produced optically.  ""Tilt–shift"" encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift.    Image i - Example for a creative photograph taken with a tilt-shift lens. The lens was shifted downwards to avoid perspective distortion: all vertical lines of the skyscrapers run parallel to the edges of the image. Tilting around the vertical axis resulted in a very small region in which objects appear sharp. (The depth of field is actually not reduced but tilted in reference to the image plane.) The picture shows Hong Kong viewed from Victoria Peak.
