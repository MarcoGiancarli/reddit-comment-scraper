Uncommon because it takes billions of years.  Galaxies are mostly in clusters and so naturally get sucked towards each other from gravity.  We can see snapshots in time of galactic collisions all around.  Obviously we can't observe it happening in real time, but there are enough of them that we can build a model.  Here's one example of an ongoing collision. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Merging_galaxies_in_the_distant_Universe_through_a_gravitational_magnifying_glass.jpg.  It's worth noting that galaxies have so much empty space that nothing actually physically collides during a collision.  Everything just gets all scrambled gravitationally.  But individual star systems like ours will stay intact.  Edit:  While often members of the same cluster of galaxies collide, the clusters themselves are expanding away from each other.  Another Andromeda fact, it is one of only a handful of galaxies that is moving towards us, 99.9% of observed galaxies are moving away from us.  In about 100 billion years Milkdromeda will be the only galaxy observable to us, all others will be too distant to see, so the observable universe basically shrinks from the current 100 billion galaxies to just one, ours."

TellMeAFact,3dryjg,ScaryTheory,3,Sat Jul 18 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"Therevada Buddhism is the largest sect, and- at least by default- teaches that the world is square, flat, and is merely one 'layer' of reality, sandwiched between what you might call ""heavens"" and ""hells"" in English, each inhabited by their own ecosystems of denizens, most of whom act the way you'd expect humans to act if humans had superpowers- and, not surprisingly, most members of royalty in southeast Asia trace their lineages back to some mythical figure in this pantheon, although these are frequently local figures.  Also, Buddhism has been used to justify some nasty shit, and some batshit crazy things.  Examples I can point to include the Ayutthaya king Taksin, who thought he was an incarnation of the Buddha, and that he had special insight to give to the Thereveda orthodoxy- not least, his assertion that his blood would change color from red to white as a signal of this.  Unsurprisingly, nobody put up with this for long, and he's one of a handful of Thai kings who have been executed- a gruesome procedure that they have a special ritual for. The king is blindfolded with - I think- a saffron-dyed silk cloth, and since nobody is allowed to make the king bleed, he has to be bludgeoned with a special sandalwood club made for the job.  They've done this to 7-year-old kids who were technically kings; fuck everything about that.  Not to mention some of the kinds of things that have been done explicitly in the name of preserving buddhism; an example of this is a form of torture-to-death punishment where the victim's skull has a hole drilled in it (while they are still alive) and then a red-hot iron bar is thrust into the hole- boiling the brains instantly and causing them to squirt out of the head.  This punishment was wide spread, and is documented in Southeast Asia and Tibet that I know of.  Examples of what might earn this for you included questioning the divinity of the local monarchy or of figures such as the Dalai Lama.  Which is why I'm very suspicious of the current Dalai Lama and not terribly sure what I think of China's occupation of Tibet, because it's unlikely that even China will do anything worse than this, and unlikely that the Dalai Lama- for all his cute sayings- could have secured a deal to get the development or rail lines that China has invested in the country.  Buddhism is different than the religions you, as an English speaker reading this, are probably more familiar with.  Some parts of it are better.  But it has the same problems as all the other cults on this spinning rock, and so you should try to learn about how to think from it- rather than what to think.  Edit: these sources are wikipedia, since I don't think most of you can read Thai and I'm not in the mood to spend 4 hours translating (English and Thai are very dissimilar; even translating basic things, such as describing the time of day, the action of turning on a light, etc, require some explanation- the linguistic description if time breaks the day into four segments rather than two, lights are ""opened"" or ""closed"", etc).  I encourage anyone to check the sources of these articles.  about Taksin  about the execution of kings in Thailand  about the execution method involving iron bars- I'll have to look some more. It's been a few years since I did the research on this, but I think I have my notes somewhere, and that should point towards my original sources.  If there's anything else, post a comment, I'll try to get back to this.  Further edit:  Here is the wiki page about Therevada cosmology."

So I see North Korea, Turkmenistan, all versions of the Abrahamic mythology, and what I can say I know about Buddhism as being different instances of the same phenomena, with different effects- positive and negative.

Real Dubstep is slower, usually around 70 BPM, oppose to the 130-150 BPM range that Bassnectar and the like will pump out, meaning that it has a much spacier sound to it.   The ""Dubstep"" most people listen to now is actually classified as ""Brostep"", ""Newstep"" or (jokingly) ""Wubstep."" This isn't even factoring in Old School Dubstep, which most people will confuse with Deep House. That type of song will be much slower, and sometimes lack the ""Wubs"" that most people associate with Dubstep.   Source: More info can be found in this article."

TellMeAFact,3dmv6r,SkoomaOverdose,2,Sat Jul 18 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"Started in Croydon in the early 2000's. Mostly a byproduct of garage, dub, etc.  Mary Anne Hobbs hosted a dubstep show on BBC radio that was called Dubstep Warz in 2006, which propelled dubstep from underground to near popularity.  Rusko and Caspa, though with some conflict within the small community of dubstep producers, released the Fabriclive 37 mix album in 2007, which is thought to have further propelled dubstep towards global recognition.    Tidbits:   Besides ""brostep"" which if often an amalgamation of more complex and/or high pitch noises, there are other sub categories such as riddim, purple, deep, dungeon, and even carnival. Riddim is known to be a bit more bouncy, purple has a lot of 80's synth influence, deep is normally what remains true to the beginning years of dubstep with basic beats and very bass heavy. Dungeon is also somewhat near deep, but the sound is much more sinister and evil sounding. Carnival, which is least like dubstep, but is sometimes categorized nonetheless for its 140bpm, is very bouncy and light, and has a happy, well.. carnival vibe.  ""dubplates"", though existing much earlier than dubstep, are vinyl records that are usually one-off and meant for shows only. So if you ever hear something like ""Is this tune a plate??"" or ""is this a dubplate??"" it is referring to the song being unreleased to the public, and only the producer having a copy.  ""Wheel it!"", ""Pull it!!"", ""reload!"" etc, are all terms used in shows when you want the song to be rewinded and replayed, though normally shouted during the first 10 seconds after the ""drop"". ie..  55 second intro..... WUB WUB WUB WUB.. ""FUCK OFFFFF!!! WHEEL ITTT!!!""

He only sold one work in his years as a artist (to Anna Boch, a friend and fellow painter), lived in destitute poverty, and by his death at 37 had been reduced to complete financial ruin.  As of today, he has his own museum in downtown Amsterdam, three paintings that have sold for over $100,000,000.00 (with many others coming close to that), and is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential artists in history."

TellMeAFact,3de7ov,J2quared,4,Wed Jul 15 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"During the Second World War, nearly 2,500,000 black Americans registered for the armed forces, and nearly 1,000,000 served in active duty. For black Americans who did not enlist, the drain on the labor market due to mass enlistment meant access to much better jobs than previously available.  When the war ended, both the returning black soldiers, and the black men and women who found themselves replaced at work by those returning from war, began organizing for a ""Double Victory,"" meaning victory over belligerent enemy states abroad and victory over segregation and racism at home. The Double Victory movement fueled two existing fires: the decades-old Civil Rights Movement, which went on to win its greatest victories in the first twenty years after the War, and the Great Migration, the mass exodus of approximately 6,000,000 black Americans from the South into northern and western urban areas, which began in the 1910s and continued through the 1970s. The results were the end of formal of segregation in the South and the growth of Southern black migrant communities in cities throughout the country, both fixtures of modern America."

You'd literally get a telephone call on your landline at 6:30 a.m. or whenever from a person who'd say ""hey, are you awake? This is your 6:30 wake-up call"" and they'd talk to you briefly and make sure you woke up.
