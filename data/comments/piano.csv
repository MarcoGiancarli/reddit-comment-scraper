piano,3e2u87,foolishknight,16,Tue Jul 21 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"I had that issue for so long, and I only recently fixed it. In online gaming they call it ""going on tilt"" and that's how I'll refer to it. One of the most important things you have to remember is that just sitting down and playing isn't practicing. Practice has to be mindful.  What I mean by that is you have to be constantly aware of what you're messing up and how you can fix it, rather than going ""well I'm going to continue"" and you keep playing.   Keep a red pencil and a black pencil with you when you practice.   You need to make a note or mark an accidental? Use the black pencil.   You mess up something more than twice in a row in the same way? Make a flag above that bar with the red pencil. (I like them to be made fast so I make a straight line down and I put a '>' on the side so it looks like a P with straight lines instead of curved.)  Now when you get to a section you have issues with you know ahead of time, this allows you to not fall into playing by memory  and not being aware of what's going on or losing yourself in thought when you're supposed to be practicing.   Next up is the rushing issue. The trick is like playing a lot of games in a semi-competitive manner. You have to realize that you're changing and getting in a worse mood before you're completely locked in, as it were, the mood. When you mess up on a section 2 or 3 times in a row and you get frustrated - Stand up! Walk around a bit, get a drink of water, take big breaths, and stretch. You'll feel better and you will make yourself more aware of your actions.   Sit down with a fresh mind and think to yourself the tempo you can cleanly and safely play this piece at. Internalize the beat and start playing from that tempo. Every time, EVERY TIME you find yourself getting upset at the music and/or yourself, do this.  This will not fix the issue in a day or two. This issue didn't develop in a single day and it will not be fixed in a single day. What you're doing is training your mind to become aware of what's happening rather than passively letting it happen. Early on you probably won't even be able to stop from tilting, so you just get up and walk away. Don't play like that.  Eventually you'll tilt less and less. Maybe you'll never hit 0% tilt, but your goal is to be better than you were yesterday. Not as good as you think you are, not as good as you want to be (since you'll always want to be better) but to know every single day you've made an improvement on yourself. If you can look at yourself in an objective manner and know that is true then you're succeeding."

piano,3e2u87,adi_piano,4,Tue Jul 21 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"I had a fantastic teacher in college who always said, ""STOP.....don't play! THINK.....ok, now play."" She was referring to the way pianists almost always seem to think that their fingers can somehow miraculously solve the technical problem on their own, maybe on the next try. No? Ok, then maybe on the next, and so on. She was teaching me to get a clear sound picture, or audiation of the passage first, then play it after. It's basically a miracle when you try it. Of course, trying it involves real concentration, not just a few seconds of silence. Pianists have widely varying abilities in the audiation arena. Some are good, most are not (at least not compared to string players, or singers). We can all use improvement there."
piano,3e2u87,duggreen,3,Tue Jul 21 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"It takes 2 to 5 minutes to get something from short term to long term memory.  If you mess something up and keep  doing it over and over again, it'll become a lasting mistake.    You need to: 1) Stop playing after messing up multiple times 2) Breath and think why this is happening 3) Slow it way down until you can play that passage correctly 4) Play it 5 times in a row correctly at a slow speed 5) Walk away from the piano for 10 minutes and mental play 6) Get back on the piano and try again"
piano,3e2u87,FrenchHustler,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"If you mess up a section multiple times that means you haven't mastered it yet, so don't keep mindlessly playing, but get take that one section and practice it (like if you would learn it, hands seperate, etc.). It's so much better, even if memorizing many pieces or if you've played pieces a lot in the past, to focus on practicing the sections that are not mastered yet, than to just play through them a couple of times.  For how to maintain pieces I think everyone has different methods. Personally I start with playing the entire piece hands seperate once (to make sure I still have it memorized, if not, check sheet), then hands together once to check what section i have trouble with and drill those sections. Do that for as many consecutive days as it takes to have it mastered again.  How often you do maintenance is up to you, the more often you do it, the more pieces you'll be able to play at that time, but the less you'll be able to learn new pieces and techniques. Personally, if I don't have to perform a piece, I  let it rest for 2-3 months before I relearn it again (which is way faster than when you were learning it for the first time). Then i let it rest again, for how long depends on how fast you were able to relearn it again (if fast, I usually let it rest longer, if long, then once again ~3 months. At some point you'll get to the point where you can just play the piece pretty much immediately even if you haven't learned it for a while. Forgetting and relearning is the best, most time efficient way to get pieces into your memory permanently, just make sure you really master a piece before letting it rest. I have an Excel file with a list of all the pieces that i want to have memorized and when i have played them the last time, with different categories based on how fast i was able to relearn it, which helps immensely organizing it."

piano,3e2u87,adi_piano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"I don't look at the quality of the pieces I am learning as having a unflinching upward trajectory. Let me explain, I'll sightread and learn, practice both hands individually, get fingering down, and concentrate on a few sections of the piece over a certain period. Eventually, the sight-read version gets just about passable in terms of quality. Then I consciously decide to start keeping my eyes off the music more and more, knowing that the quality is going to plummet because I don't have the memorization hardly at all. The first sections I focus on looking away are usually over page breaks. Over this period, it sounds like I'm brand new to the song and I'm absolutely okay with that. I go back and repeat when I make mistakes and pay attention for mental 'cues' that help me remember the next time around. This period is highly important because it also tends to solidify the muscle memory more than the 'intellectual' brain memory, if that makes sense. Eventually, more and more sections can be played with reckless abandon and little concentration and a few stick out as difficult to memorize. Then I concentrate on those sections, especially the transitions in and out of them, usually using a metronome and going back to playing both hands separately. Always remember to loosen up if you get frustrated at any point. If you're stiff, practicing is useless."

What I'm thinking is that if you don't have a lot of time to practice during the week, I would say the 30min lesson would be more logical.   I have 1 piano piece I work on, and he assigns me several pages from my book to work on as well. It can be overwhelming, but the one hour lesson is wonderful. If the piece I'm working on is giving me more trouble than we expected, we can dedicate some time near the end for polishing up those final parts and not take away from the lesson."

If you find that you're picking stuff up quickly, or if you already have a decent understanding of music theory, you can switch it up to an hour.  There comes a point when you need 60+ minute lessons because some pieces can take 20+ minutes to play, but those are in the advanced repertoire."

piano,3e2gd2,headies1,4,Tue Jul 21 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"Start simple and build up in complexity as your hands get more independent. Something like, playing quarter note roots in the left hand and going up and down the scale in 8th notes. Then start to change it up - swing 8th notes in the right hand, etc.  Also, I strongly recommend learning some Bach. Playing counterpoint will force you to develop strong hand independence, and once you do it's like using the Force. Suddenly your hands are doing two very different things, weaving around each other, and it feels great.  I recommend the F Major invention to start. Learn each hand separately, then slowly bring them together. It'll be slow going at first, but it will click sooner or later.  Here's an IMSLP link, but if you can get your hands on the Schirmer edition, it has some good suggested fingerings. Just ignore the tempo markings, because I find them to be way too fast.  http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/f/f3/IMSLP00754-BWV0779.pdf"

Bach's works, especially his two part inventions, while beautiful and masterfully written, can also be an amazing study aid for just this problem.

I've been trying to improve in this respect as well, so if anybody has any other tips I would greatly appreciate it!  An exercise I have started practicing are those ostinatos (repeating bass lines). Basically, an ostinato is a constant rhythmic bass line in the left hand with an improvised melody over the right hand. At first start really simple, such as quarter notes in the left hand (lets say D - A - D) and eighth notes in the right hand (you can use the d minor scale, for example).  Use a metronome!   Practice it at a slow bpm and as much as possible until you feel comfortable at that tempo, then raise the bpm by 2 or 4 clicks, and repeat. This is to make the skill absolutely solid.  Eventually you can get creative and make your own ostinatos as well aa go onto harder and more interesting rhythmic differences.   Also, play LOTS of Bach.  I hope this helps, or at least give an idea for what you can do to improve!"

piano,3e2gd2,thedude37,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"It's not a coordination problem, it's a lack of clear 'sound picture' or audiation. Jamming requires much stronger audiation than playing written music. It's because you turn your attention away from the LH while you make up stuff in the right. A simple way to start solving it is to limit your practice to really 'square' riffs in your RH while you 'listen' to your left. Usually, it's on the 'cooler', more rhythmically complex riffs that the LH falls off time. By practicing simpler riffs in the R and concentrating on the L, they will soon become integrated enough that you can 'listen' or audiate both hands while playing even nutty stuff with the right. Hope I 'splained this ok?"

piano,3e2gd2,ssweet06,2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"Get whatever pattern you want rock solid in your left, then start simply in our right.  Make some tight limits for yourself so you can solve individual problems.  Use only 2 or 3 notes to solo for a while and focus on rhythmic ideas mostly involving both straight and swung 8ths, heavy emphasis on syncopations, and triplet stuff.  Those are the things that either need the most work or cause the most grief.  Once the larger rhythmic hurdle is over, you can start messing with more notes running scales and licks against your left.  If you're really having trouble with a particular rhythmic figure, it's probably actually worth writing it down.  For one, it might just be easier for your brain to work on decoding or understanding the subdivision that way, and for two, it will give you a reminder of something you need to work on potentially daily for a while.  Usually once you've worked out a particularly difficult rhythmic bugaboo, you sort of have it at your disposal.  So essentially just keep chipping away at them until you've got plenty."

piano,3e34hx,zondebok,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Looking at the intervals is how you sightread fast, since you don't have the time to check each note by itself (much like you are reading words and not just letters), so i don't see how that should be a problem. As you've done, I'd just seperate sight reading practice from actually practicing a piece. I find it far better to memorize all the pieces you are working on, since it allows you to really pay attention to your actual technique. Just play through 15-30 mins of music you've never seen before (and is ~ your sight reading level) each day in addition to practicing your pieces, and you should get better at sightreading in no time."
piano,3e34hx,blubwage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"The main reason I am trying to avoid reading by intervals is that I find it fairly easy to do it that way,  but reading the notes is more like deciphering notes, so that is what I want to practice.   It seems like it will be harder to just read intervals with chords where all the notes don't follow the same interval change also.   I will be memorizing the pieces that I'm working on whether I like it or not,  since it just seems to happen after 1-2 times of playing through it. I have been told many times that this will be a valuable skill (along with playing by ear),  but it seems to make sight reading more difficult."

piano,3e3156,Banaszewski,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"A year and a half is a very short time. Your brain-hand coordination is just not that well-trained yet. Give it more time and practice without loss of focus. You will get there soon.   It is normal for a pianist to go through many separate phases of development, even for one single piece. First you don't know the music and you concentrate on every single note. It sounds horrible, but eventually you play all the notes. After a while you start relaxing. The playing sounds better, more fluid and that's when you lose focus and start making mistakes.   This might lead you to believe you have gone backwards, but nothing is further from the truth. It's just that you've reach a part of your training where you almost know the piece and want to give control to your hear/soul or whatever it may be, instead of the controlling brain. This is a necessary step or it will never sound fluid, but the way there is rocky.  Keep practicing! Do not give up. There comes a day, when you release your muscle memory to be completely guided by your artistic side and virtually no control is exercised by the conscious brain, but that can takes months or years. For a single piece.   Luckily, this process can be very rewarding and even more luckily, most people listening to you won't be able to tell any difference after you've gone past a certain point that is still miles away from your full potential."

I think with piano music, the recordings are done by the absolute best in the world, and it's easy to compare oneself too much to them. But as you say, it takes years of playing the same piece to reach the level of comfort with the piece we hear them playing with.  I will keep practising! Thanks :)"

If I'm learning a new piece, I will play a few bars at a time as slowly as I need to and just keep playing them over until they are at full speed, then move on to the next few bars. I repeat this until I have done the whole piece and then I play through the whole piece over and over again and then move onto another one.  Is there something else I should be doing?"

My teach is a sight-reading beast, but my guess is he'd find this pretty tough.  An introspective theme which is reprised at the end. In the middle, it enters very dissonant territory either very high up the keyboard or pretty low (lots of ledger lines and accidentals to boot).  I think getting the right effect here is a matter of some pretty outstanding control of dynamics and voices."

By a month I typically have it memorized but after another is when I can play it with absolute confidence. Also jelly roll Morton is very challenging for me so that makes it take as long.

piano,3e1l83,Musekratos,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:10 2015 UTC,At some pont it depends entirely on the piece. Schumann's 'Kinderszenen' are technically easy but take years and years to perfect. A flashy encore like Etincelles takes about a week.  Same for Chopin: Learning any Mazurka takes exponentially longer than the - technically more demanding - Nocturnes.

piano,3e1l83,Synecdoche09,2,Wed Jul 22 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"It depends at what point you think you've learned the piece.  For example, I just started learning Chopin's Op. 48 Nocturnes. No. 2 is pretty easy - I could play through it sight-reading.  Does that mean I've learned it? Probably not.  It's been a week, and is pretty solid right now. Probably another week and it will be memorized.  I only spend about 20 minutes a day on it, but it's pretty repetitive.  I have a recital coming up in October - I've been working on those pieces (on and off) for months.  Bach English Suite No. 3, Brahms' Op. 119, and Elliott Carter's Sonata.  They're memorized, and I've performed them before.  But I still have a lot that can be done in the next few months, and they are probably pieces that I will continue to play for the rest of my life.  TLDR: A day or two for notes, a couple weeks for memory, and a lifetime to perfect."
piano,3e1l83,Synecdoche09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"Now that's a good answer! I'm 58 and I'm still working on pieces that I learned 20 years ago. My technique is probably not much better, but I make much better music now. When I was young, I thought Liszt was hard, now I struggle more with Mozart."
piano,3e1l83,furryfucker9000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"I love this question and I want to give a good answer so I'm going to give some background. I never used the grade level system for learning since I started very late but within about a year of starting lessons (roughly 1.5 years after starting) my teacher gave me a grade 7 piece. I spent a month on it to memorize and learn some 'musicality'. I was so bad then compared to now I don't even want to use the term seriously hahaha. The next piece I was given was grade 8. I assume she did this to kinda flesh out my technique and skill.  Since then I'd say it takes me about 8 or so hours of solid practice to learn a piece where I can play it comfortably and work on things other than playing the right notes. Another 5 or so memorize (honestly probably less, I can play things mostly accurately after only 2-3 readings but that's my average depending on difficulty) and after that, there's no end to the practice. Voicing, rubato, and other musical efforts become center stage for what I'm working on.  I'm playing the second movement of the Rach 2 for my Junior recital and after a year off of school due to personal issues I came back and got my program reassembled and flushed out, and I want to say it took me about 15 hours to go from mostly reading all of the notes and not even playing them right to virtually memorized.   Overall, I'd say for pieces my level I take around 12 practice hours to memorize. There's no end to the practice after that. A piece is never perfected or perfect."

On the other hand, the left hand pattern is the same for the entire piece, which makes it kinda boring. The right hand is pretty straight forward as well, just the melody and the middle voice that continues throughout the entire piece. I think if you add more variety to the left hand and maybe add a bit more enrichment to the right hand, it'll be a nicer piano piece. At the same time you will end up with something that is a bit different than the original, so in the end it is just a matter of preference, what you really want your transcription to be. For an accurate transcription its pretty good."

Chopin 25/10 does not cover the basics of playing octaves. It requires legato octaves, you have to play melody in the middle finger and index finger.

The tempo is unusually slow for this piece, but I like it. Like Banaszweski said, the melody needs to be louder, and everything else should be softer. The simple melodies in a lot of these romantic era pieces are meant to emulate singing, so try to bring it out a little bit more.  Other than that, it sounds fantastic.

For an even better performance I would try to play the right hand in the opening melody a bit louder, when the left hand is playing arpeggios it is easy for the right hand to be lost so you need to try especially hard to make sure it sings properly"

piano,3dz7pv,Hysteria-GT,0,Tue Jul 21 13:20:47 2015 UTC,Bring out that melody more   literally not possible on my piano without banging. it goes from f to ff   (spinnet?)   nope it's an actual piano  thanks guys
piano,3dz7pv,Hysteria-GT,0,Tue Jul 21 14:02:06 2015 UTC,literally not possible on my piano without banging. it goes from f to ff   Ok let me word it differently... Lower the volume of your left hand.  Bringing out the melody does not mean banging your right hand harder. For someone playing Liszt I'm surprised I have to explain this concept to you.

You can also get simplified version of musical sound tracks to movies or video games, or you can just play pop sons. It helps keep me motivated when I'm playing something fun. Once you get in the habit of playing songs all the way through you can switch back and forth between the fun stuff and the technical stuff.   And when you get really good you can play fun technical stuff. I found a piano adaptation of the Star Wars: A New Hope soundtrack that is super hard, it is giving my piano teacher conniptions. It is the first piece of classical music that he hasn't been able to passably sight read on his first (or second or third) attempt."
piano,3dx7ql,Secret_Identity_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:40:44 2015 UTC,If you want a piece that is incredibly impressive sounding AND isn't all that hard I would suggest Solfeggietto.  It might be fast and a little intimidating but it has common patterns in the piece so once you learn one part the others share the same pattern on different keys. It was the 4th song I ever learned and is totally do-able! Goodluck!

piano,3dx5y8,denarian,2,Mon Jul 20 07:34:36 2015 UTC,I usually just roll them because I can't stretch a tenth. As long as you're consistent in the way you play them it shouldn't matter too much. Practice them in scales like this:  C-E D-F E-G   And try to get a consistent roll between the two notes for each one.

piano,3dwd9j,MrHassanSan,6,Mon Jul 20 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"Have a human play them.  That aside, there are a lot of small things you can do—randomize velocities slightly (your DAW may offer an option to tell it something like ""randomly add a value between –5 and +5 to the velocity of these notes""). Some nuances that aren't difficult for a skilled human performer are very complicated to replicate by inputting notes one at a time, e.g. rubato timing, which would require you to manually shift notes back and forth to achieve the desired effect."
piano,3dwd9j,prikaz_da,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, if only I had a pianist at my disposal.  I'm learning to play, but I've been working hard to train my ear to pick up on the nuances of a performer. But for example, would you say the short rubato part near the end of the first section (around 1:08) was done poorly on my part?"
piano,3dwd9j,behindtheaegis,5,Mon Jul 20 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"I'm a pianist, but sometimes it's nice to have the pressure of performing after all that work composing loaded off onto another person.  That's why we collaborate in the first place!  This is what I do:  1) Go to a local music school 2) Get permission to post an ad on the bulletin board in the piano building 3) ""Attn: Performer Needed for Recording - Pay $50"" 4) Fight off the hyper-talented and poor college students 5) Rent recording space and invite them to play 6) Enjoy your beautiful, human recording"
piano,3dwd9j,prikaz_da,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. I wouldn't have recognized that as rubato if you hadn't labelled it as such—it just sounds like the pianist decided to speed up kind of unevenly for no apparent reason before returning to the previous tempo.   I've never studied the mathematics of rubato, per se, but my intuition as a pianist is that there are unwritten 'rules' as to how rubato should be played and sound. Like the grammar of your first language, you might not be able to explain why something is correct or not, but you know without a doubt when something is right and when it is not because you've been exposed to the language more or less from the time you were born. Similarly, I think longtime musicians (I started playing music at an early age, too) learn what good rubato sounds like from hearing good rubato and just feeling it in the music."
piano,3dwd9j,sasuke7532,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:05 2015 UTC,"The fact that there are no mathematics is why rubato's rubato. You can analyze the infinitesimal specifics of a rubato section or the like, but you definitely can't reproduce them organically with a program. That would take forever. And people would have already done that quite a bit, I imagine."
piano,3dwd9j,ebmfreak,4,Mon Jul 20 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"You are looking for something in Midi editing literally called ""Humanization"" -- sometimes ""Humanize"".  It adds small variances throughout, and does some attack differences etc. on each note.  Usually you use it on a drum track, but you can sometimes get it to work with a melody.  If you google that term ""Humanization + Midi""  or ""Humanize Midi"", and you'll find lots of tips for it.  Logic Pro actually has a built in humanize function you can add to any track."
piano,3dwd9j,samsquamchh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:34 2015 UTC,"This is what I wanted to say. What also helps is if the sound patch you are using has several samples for each velocity. Like a set of 88 sounds all in forte, another set in piano, a set in mezzoforte, a set in mezzopiano, and so on and so forth. Depending on where the velocity sits (some applications have the ability to change that), it will trigger a certain sample.  At the end however it's much more work than you can bargain for. It's best to just outsource someone if you don't want to do the work because a computer will never be able to play an instrument as well as a human."
piano,3dwd9j,buriedabovetheground,3,Mon Jul 20 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"What daw do you use? I like the piece. If to exclude the honing of playing skills that came before that moment, knowing how to realize this with your hands would've likely taken less time (granted the intervals are within reach) than building that up in a piano roll of some sort, from individual midi notes (assuming you don't have some audio-to-midi harmonics shortcuts going on there in the process). Anyway, the simplest place to start is timing. Are your notes laid down in a grid? If so, take any form of quantization off whatever medium you're using and play around with shifting the notes ever so slightly out of alignment. This will be tedious though, especially if you try to stick to a slight pattern, for an example if a pianist has a weaker left hand and his 4th and 5th fingers lag behind a bit when pressing down chords etc, you can imagine what I mean. Very very slight details, which your brain in a tune wont necessarily understand but your ear can pick up. Then there's another big one, velocity, this is perhaps even more noticeable, if every note has the exact same volume, or you've made some changes but yet again are too organised and stick to a grid like approach to the structure of the piece, it'll sound very fake and flat. This is another tedious job but carefully polishing every note with a mix of human randomness and meaningful expression (it has to make some sense, cant just throw velocity up and down all over the place with no aim) will take you much closer. It truly probably is easier and more meaningful to spend that time on learning to play your tunes, but timing and velocity are the two big ones. Next you might want to look into your sound source and see if any sort of modulation would benefit you, but it's very easy to start moving further from your goal past that point, it'll also get more technology oriented rather than simulating the nuances of a human pianist playing."
piano,3dwd9j,yyyfa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! I'm using Ableton Live. I'm trying to learn piano so I can play things myself, but for now, with no real recording equipment (I'm working on it!) I'm looking for ways to subtly make a piece more expressive...once I have more time and recording equipment, I probably will outsource all of this to an actual human. But again, thank you!"
piano,3dwd9j,Glsbnewt,3,Mon Jul 20 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"I think adding sustain pedal to certain parts could really help, since every thing starts sounding cool and then all of a sudden all the noise stops and it basically starts over, And also the accelerandos are pretty sharp tempo increases and jarring when it sounds like it's supposed to be a relaxed andante piece.  As for robotic sounding I think it's because as you're writing the music it is probably all succinct timing as a normal score is written. however when this is played back I think it's creating a detache sound but the note changes are so instantaneous that it can't help to sound like a computer file, it sounds like you're letting notes hang on to try to create a sustaining sound but then they all disappear at exactly the same time which will also stick out as digital.   you might consider firstly trying out to overlap the notes very slightly on the piano roll to create more of a legato where it seems necessary and shortening them to create a staccato.   accenting the melodies a little more might help also, as well trying to infuse a little Tempo Rubato to make it more human, I would recommend you read up on chopin's rubato, since it was regarded as pretty wild and yet he always kept the metre the same in the end. I like to think of rubato as an accent for the tempo,  Pretty melodies though, it is probably really hard to market solo piano writing nowadays but it's definitely good writing practice or portfolio material,"
