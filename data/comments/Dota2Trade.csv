Dota2Trade,3e4tmf,Changoo96,0,Tue Jul 21 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"IMO, if it's just for the SF immortal, it's closer to fair as SF is valued at between $4-15, but the more accurate range is $6-10. Whalehook is I believe a $5 bettable. It's not a bad deal at this point, but you potentially could get better. It depends on if you want it to bet or if you want it to use."

Dota2Trade,3dyjmp,ArabianKing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"Hey and thanks for the interest. Several thing I need to mention:    The main reason I don't do paypal is of course the chargeback possibilities and the stupid ToS of Paypal, that allows them even 6 months after the transaction. Having said that, Skrill allows chargebacks also (even though it's a lot harder to be done) ... which means that I'm always doing background checks of the people who want to buy something from me, no matter what payment method I use. Even if I'm 100% sure that the person who I'm trading with won't chargeback, I still try to avoid Paypal, because when I withdraw money I suffer from extreme currency exchange rate between my PP balance and my debit card I use (in my country there is no withdrawal to bank account possible). I don't know who to blame for that honestly... my bank, visa, or paypal ... I just know that after a withdrawal I lose ~8% from the amount that I withdraw (that's without the general fee of 2.9$ per withdrawal). Many of the people who I regularly trade with, or want to trade with me for the first time, actually offered to pay that 8% difference, but I'm against that, cause their money actually go to one of those greedy companies, and that makes me sick... I can always accept WU or Moneygram payments for transactions below $200, though fees are a KILLER (seems that they are not that huge for some countries though and some people have actually bought stuff from me for WU even for a small transaction). I can always, and have done so multiple times, help with info about how to create, verify and send money through Skrill.   TLDR I don't accept paypal not because I don't trust most of the people around, but because the currency exchange rate is awful."

Dota2Trade,3dzxr6,c0rp1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:40:53 2015 UTC,Bettable value doesn't mean anything to me and it will also change. The market value of this courier is $26.50-26.70. No one pays 100% of steam market value for any item with using paypal.
Dota2Trade,3dzxr6,dankq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"I'm just explaining why $15 Paypal wouldn't work at all...   Bettable value can mean nothing to you, but actually means a lot to most of the people (trading's almost dead, so people mainly bet). Rex is one of the few items out there, that had somewhat of a fixed price for a long time, and a stable bettable price in d2l as well. That's why it's bettable value has stayed the same (might have already updated though).   Even if that price updates, Rex will still have a huge demand and will be sold for not less than ~70-75% for it's SCM Value."

Dota2Trade,3dzxr6,dankq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"No objective at all actually ...  I said that IF the bettable value of the Rex changes, it will be worth 26.5 x .7 or .75.

While the gem is worth x and the arcana is worth y,combined they aren't worth x + y because replacing the gem destroys the gem and removing the gem destroys the arcana.  I think then my answer is: If it's for personal use then yes,fine value. If it's for betting/trading/disassembling then no. Hope that helps and I reserve the right to be talking shit."

Dota2Trade,3dz1hh,hugoleotosta,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:56 2015 UTC,Current version seems safe since it's public sourcecode on github iirc. Valve doesn't approve of it per se and will ban you if they think you are market botting. But that doesn't happen often unless it's really obvious.

Dota2Trade,3dz1hh,DawnLightDota,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:15 2015 UTC,Valve doesn't approve or allow the use of such in their terms and conditions from what i know and you may be banned . Probably you should do it on a secondary account :))

Dota2Trade,3dy309,teh_paradox,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:26 2015 UTC,"That's incorrect. All these arcanas are going up in price due to betting season w. ti5 closing in. That being said, CM is worth less since it was on sale and there are a fuckton more of them. TB is worth less (used to be on the same tier as LC) since he's a shit tier hero in the meta atm and no one plays him."
Dota2Trade,3dy309,Avar1cious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:11:29 2015 UTC,where is the best place to bet?
Dota2Trade,3dy309,chenriquevz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"that's debatable. google dota2lounge bet discussion and find the first reddit link, you can ask there."
Dota2Trade,3dy309,Avar1cious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:54 2015 UTC,"I have about 725 wins, would that be enough to bump up the value?"
Dota2Trade,3dy309,Avar1cious,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no. No one really gives a shit about the amount of duel wins you have unless it's a ""special #"" or stupidly stupidly high...even then it's only certain special people who care. Also, since you have an intent of selling, I suggest you wait until the TI5 group stages/main event. Price will be highest then."

Dota2Trade,3dw8bb,kcmyk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:07:23 2015 UTC,"I've read your post and you don't want anything I have to offer, but I figured out I might be lucky since I want to do a 3 for 2 trade, because I'm only interested in items for my favorite heroes and I don't really care about market, betting and stuff and I assume you are. I have WD, Sven and Sand King immortals and I'm looking for AM regular basher's and TA's. Hit me up if you're interested, I can go first with a 1:1 trade so you see I'm not bullshiting you. Thanks in advance."
Dota2Trade,3dw8bb,elir_kvothe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"While I genuinely appreciate the offer, I actually value the bashers and focal resonance much higher than the three you're offering..and I already have several of each of them. If i could sell or bet them now...then I would consider it. Unfortunately, I can't and I actually have noticed a much higher demand for the two immortals that you're looking for. If it were nature's prophet and disruptor immortals that you were looking for...I would consider it.  Also, just fyi: the immortals 3 are worth more than 1 and 2 just because there are less of them out there."

Dota2Trade,3dx88w,puremage111,4,Mon Jul 20 07:49:42 2015 UTC,"just a few suggestions:   1) Stay out from knives market for now. there are a lot of patterns, variants etc etc, not easy for a beginner to start with. You will gradually learn while trading smaller stuff so don't worry.  2) The condition is simply how your weapon looks in game. Factory New is the best, Battle Scarred is the worst. Off course the exterior quality affect prices.  Dont' make the mistake to trade only the best quality (FN), the CSGO market is big enough to sustain all the qualities; even a bad quality skin can be traded with no hassle. If you have some doubts, just go for the FT quality, generally accepted everywhere.  Learn the abbreviations (FN, MW, FT, WW, BS) so you can check if it's a good trade just with a quick glance.  3) the demand/supply is based on weapons; if a weapon is popular/strong the value is high.      AK-47, M4A1-S, M4A4, AWP, DEAGLE.... those are the highest value weapons  NEGEV, M249, SCAR... those are all example of low value weapons, but, as i said before, CSGO market is pretty florid so you will always find someone interested even in low-tier weapons  4) i highly reccomend to NOT unbox, at least for now.  If you want something to start, buy a few keys.     I suggest you to check this site csgo stash for skins value  5) as a beginner, START TO PLAY THE GAME. it seems an obvious suggestion but you will earn drops while playing.   Check the value of every items you get (you will probably get only trash). Keep the cases, sell the trash skins.   If you are lucky enough to to receive a nice skin/case as a drop, sell it immediately on steam market or csgo subreddit.  AIM FOR THE KEYS  6) when you have some keys, follow the classic rule ""buy low-sell high"".   Buy a skin with keys under the market price, and sells it on steam (or forums) for normal value  good luck and have fun  sorry for my bad english"

Dota2Trade,3dnbm4,Avar1cious,4,Fri Jul 17 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think the courier's pretty cool  and while I agree that the comparison with last year's doomling is unfair, I'm not so sure about the possibility of an increase in price.   you have some fairly strong arguments but, compared to other pre-existing immortals (say the timebreaker) whose very same arguments for stability/deflation are even stronger, they're not reasons for a price increase.   this is because all of this info is public knowledge and there is a large enough user base that potential increase is already built into the current market price.  this is something people often overlook.   say valve releases a single special courier given to the winning ti5 team to share. the price of this item doesn't slowly increase from $1 to $10000, it's going to immediately come off the shelves with buy offers through the roof. everybody knows that everybody wants this item. everybody is aware that a further price increase likely to occur. what does this mean? it means that since this speculation is public knowledge, it is built into the price of the item.     in my opinion, there are only two things that justify a price increase: accessibility and an unforeseen event.   1) accessibility. the difficulty to acquire it.  (this is what collectors love most, and collectors are end-buyers, they are the ones that end up paying the highest price.)  this doesn't mean item count, it doesn't relate to the item's drop rate and it's not related to how difficult it is to obtain the item independently. it is how difficult it is to obtain the item, given you already have the assets to trade for it. it is how likely a seller is willing to sell the item.   c1 pbrs, for example, like to stay in the Chinese markets. favored items like dendi's favored stache or xboct's favored arcana are difficult to get access to. legendary legacies (whose existence are slowly turning into myths) never go public. jumos suddenly became near-impossible to purchase even if you have money and look what happened, oops.   if you truly have it such that you can depend on other owners not selling theirs unless it's for a profit, then you've got some profit potential. this is what happened to cycle 1 gbrs. once everybody started selling theirs then more and more owners were willing to sell theirs for less, the status quo had changed.   for lower tier item flipping, ""accessibility"" is your ability to re-purchase items for less than what you sold it for. sometimes, no matter how hard you look, you can't find a price for less than what you sold for. if this happens to you then you are the on the tip of the spear, you are the first to witness the increase in price, with that last sale you just set a new ""low"" for that item. or you miscalculated and sold too low, whoopsie.   2) an unforeseen event.   unforeseen is the important word here. ti4 genuine couriers are a good example of this. everybody foresaw the possibility of an added unusual effect so even if they updated it, the increase in price would not be significant. not many foresaw what happened to timebreakers and hooks, so they were allowed to have an over 10,000% return of value.   when I say unforeseen, I'm talking about the knowledge of general population. the 99%.   for example, since the dota market cap is so tiny, a group of whales have the potential of buying a significant portion of the market, decreasing supply. this type of market manipulation is often unseen and unannounced, creating a sense of supply drop (and thus demand increase) which artificially increases price. these pump-and-dump schemes are often very successful. everybody runs around on a wild goose chase trying to find a reason for the price increase/drop, it is a gold mine if the public finds a reason and convinces themselves it's true (further increasing price).   when the price of alpine sets dropped due to the very small amount of bundled sets released into the market, that was an example of the public reacting to what they believed was an increase of supply, despite the already large amount of duped alpine sets. when a public consensus is achieved, the market moves accordingly.   other things can drive prices up or down, like an increase in player base, or a balance or graphical update.   but again, to reiterate, following popular opinion will almost never make you any money. which is particularly true for easily-accessible items.     now, for the Rex courier, I feel it's always going to be easy to obtain. I feel like it's not special enough to justify keeping it forever (unlike the history behind the Jumo courier). additionally, it's not unusual so you're not able to personalize it, making it less likely for people to get attached to it.   the potential is there, but there are other immortals that are better bets. like honestly, golden greevils would be a better investment due to their relatively low price to count ratio, as in their price increase percentage-wise is more likely, and they're not a very good investment choice. so, yeah."

Dota2Trade,3dnbm4,opne,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"there's a bunch of offers ranging from $1500 to $2000 to BUY one, I haven't seen one sold in the longest time.   I finally average sub 18 on the Rubik's cube so I've not played with one in a while.   I've dived pretty deeply into the numismatic world.   I've gotten accepted to a pretty elite math academy over the summer, so I've been busy studying.   I've gotta decide on what to do with my TI5 tickets now that I'm not going."

Whether the price could somehow increase remains to be seen; I feel like with the growing amount of players in dota, there will also be a growing amount of collectors in the future so the possibility is there :p"

Dota2Trade,3dop4y,jocobralex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"It'll be available to buy from the store as an ordinary chest (+charm, though perhaps priced higher than standard chests at that, last years was $3 a pop).

At this point, there will be less AM Bashers than Slark Golden Skadis and even less Gold Gyros...but for all we know, the SF arms could end up being more in demand even with there being a lot of them out there.

Dota2Trade,3dnhz6,elir_kvothe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"that's what people thought about the AM Bashers and I got an exalted SF Arcana for them last week...which is more than the Inscribed SF Arcana I got for them a month ago. IMO, it's all supply and demand and there will certainly be less of them around after most people that don't plan on keeping it gift them away (since they can't be gifted again and he's one of the most popular heroes right now).   Either way, in my opinion, it is still going for at least and arcana or higher now or $15-45 with the more reasonable range being $20-40 depending on how many people are bidding for the same item and how patient the seller is."

Dota2Trade,3dmjrr,scarecrowman175,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:03 2015 UTC,there are no prices yet. immortals going for other immortals 1:1 (except rare / very rare drops -> these are from 2-3 (cs:go) keys to arcana's).  we cant give them a pricetag yet cause these are not marketable and all depends on what are the others willing to pay for it. so you can give them a pricetag yourself for now by willing or declining the trades which you see fit.

You do not need any money in your wallet for it to deny you trying to sell (list) items for over that amount.  I meant that by full not necessarily I have 10+ accounts sitting on 500 wallet.

As in if ur a red greevil with 1eu youd have exort air. 3eu would be exort aura. If ur a seraphic one with 2 eu youd have sanct ambience and with 3eu itl be sanct aura.

Steam community market link of unusual merciless greevils with the word ""aura"" in their description   Body Parts x/9 has nothing to do with Unusual Essences, it is merely the no. of body parts an unusual greevil possesses and it has nothing to do with the effect of the unusual greevil.

Dota2Trade,3dkvbn,Draekar4,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"Most value untradeable items at 5-30% (min-max) of the current SCM for the marketable version of the item. For this item, a lot of sellers will want a PA Arcana, so you may end up having to overpay, but honestly the price varies on a lot of things. Like the Shaper's Relic and Ceaseless Sorcery will be much cheaper than the max of 30% because they are for unpopular heroes, especially in pro play.   IMO, the only two nexon items worth a PA Arcana are the Shattered Greatsword or Pipe of Dezun since they are more valuable. Neverthe less, I'd say a golden skadi or Nyx Dagon($17.50) or 6-8 CSGO keys would be generous offer to start at. So like, the lesser valuable giftable Nexon items, Shaper's Relic and Ceaseless Sorcery should go for like 2-5 keys (min-max) or $5-13.50."

Dota2Trade,3dibrt,Sweetfang,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:10 2015 UTC,I'll be getting the Demis again this year and maybe an Alchemist hat but that's about it. The Demis more for the figures than the items since I can just pick those off the market (I might wait and buy already opened Demis from people for cheap XD).   There's one  item I've got my eye on though. That's the special stuff you get for collecting all stickers on the sticker book. If it doesn't disappoint I think that's where I'll be spending the majority of my TI budget this year. I wish they did the community card thing again this year but whatever.

Dota2Trade,3dibrt,canon624,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:00 2015 UTC,I've just got my eye on it. I don't plan on trying to actually get the stickers. I'll much rather wait for someone to get the item and buy it off them if they are willing to sell. My luck has always been shitty with these things I'd probably get the same sticker over and over again (35 Immortal 3s opened and no zeus :().   All that said I just saw that the keyboards have an exclusive items with them too so that's on my list as well which shoots my total to well over $300 for the emote packs :D. The wording on the site makes it sound like if you spend 300 you get 6 packs but you had to split purchases previous years just to more courier cards.

Dota2Trade,3dibrt,soicanbefree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:49:39 2015 UTC,Go to the item in the catalog and look at the comment section.  The questions were asked and answered.

Dota2Trade,3dgdvi,elir_kvothe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:16:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the upvote buddy! That's much appreciated!
Dota2Trade,3dgdvi,Avar1cious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:20:49 2015 UTC,"This is the first legit auction in quite a while, where the reserve isn't OP's buyout. In fact, the item value sorter greatly understates your inventory's worth since it doesn't account for the giftables as well as various gems. I wish you the best of luck dude!"

Dota2Trade,3df5j4,kragelol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:16 2015 UTC,you aren't doing the preorder?
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,juice4624,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"I am aiming to do one giant pre-order, however, last minute requests always happen and then I will wait in line the following days."
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,shiradota,3,Wed Jul 15 21:21:37 2015 UTC,With the pre-order there will effectively be no 4 hour lines.  There could be 30 minute lines but nothing like the stupidity of a line that wraps around the stadium.
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,emit_,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:25 2015 UTC,The pre-order is a mitigation technique to prepare the store for the upcoming sale orders. This only attempts to reduce lines but won't eliminate it. People will still need to wait as the first batch of orders is still at high volume.
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,juice4624,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:57 2015 UTC,Thats what Im hoping for!
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,MonarchDoto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:24:53 2015 UTC,just asking because that would take away waiting in line; but could be that you are buying extra stuff
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,GifftedIdeas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:17 2015 UTC,"So how do you feel about buying stuff and just sending the in-game codes over email? :-)  I don't care about the real objects, but I do care about the in-game cosmetics (which means you would be able to do with the figurines etc. whatever you like)."
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,MonarchDoto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'll take his stuff and add the shipping onto whatever order I place, OP. Will be adding you shortly"
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,iTz_SLammi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:59 2015 UTC,I do not send codes over email due to being scammed. I will send you the unscratched code tickets through the mail.
Dota2Trade,3df5j4,iTz_SLammi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:33 2015 UTC,The reason I asked is that I live en Europe and not NA. Ohh well.
