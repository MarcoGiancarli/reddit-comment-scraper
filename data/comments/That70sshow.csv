That70sshow,3d2dow,NotEricForman,11,Sun Jul 12 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"After Eric left, he was supposed to take his place. He was supposed to be the funny and witty guy who dated Donna. I believe he served a purpose to the show, but the reason he receives so much hate is because the way he entered the gang was forced, and he could never really live up to how Eric was."
That70sshow,3d2dow,Quixoticelixor,8,Sun Jul 12 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"When both Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace left the show, they felt the cast was too weak to carry an entire season. Not because of acting ability, just not enough storyline ignition points because they were missing two main characters.  Charlie (Bret Harrison) was introduced to replace Eric and well liked because he was a unique character, but when he decided to go work on a different, new series so the character was killed off.   So, left without Eric, Kelso, and now Charlie, a new character had to be created to try and fill out multiple roles. We got Randy. Had the pretty boy, womanizer charm of Kelso AND the quick witted attitude of Eric, plus the ever positive outlook that Charlie was meant to have.   We received a character with almost no real flaws, who was hurriedly introduced and only stuck around for one season. We had no time to learn to like him, and he lacked the flaws that made us love the rest of the gang.   Josh Meyers actually did a fine job with the character in my opinion, but it was a bad character to start with."
That70sshow,3d2dow,nightwing2024,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:51 2015 UTC,"Plus, when the character didn't really take off, they pushed off some of his traits to other characters... like the womanizer charm on Fez. Which didn't really make sense to me after 7 seasons."
That70sshow,3d2dow,electricbolt,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"The character had a planned role, but other than that, it felt like the writers weren't too sure what to do with him. Especially since season 8 was just wrapping up storylines anyways."
That70sshow,3d2dow,electricbolt,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:17 2015 UTC,They needed a replacement for Eric as a central character of the show though I don't think he is ever placed in that role and if anything Jackie becomes the central character of the final season. But yes he didn't serve much of a purpose during the season considering he was meant to be the replacement for the main character.

That70sshow,3ccax7,AwkwardKid94,4,Tue Jul 7 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"I actually posted the video here months ago. You have to realize that That 70's Show didn't expect to stay on the air that long so the inconsistencies with time would be understandable (I think that's the biggest support of this theory). I'm rewatching it a 3rd time and I'm on season 4 and it's already '78. Playing it by ear in terms of the years and not knowing how long they'd be on lead to this.  There are a lot of better ways this could have been done if this theory were supported. Such as Eric not going to Africa and maybe instead having his friends do bigger things to show his own stagnant life (which would be because he's in the coma). At the end of the finale episode where the friends run upstairs to catch the last of the countdown, it'd have been a stronger point to him finally letting go if he'd been the last one up there and spent a moment looking around the basement at his previous memories (which would have fit with the storyline since he just returned from Africa). The theory can certainly work, but as I watch the episodes again, I've found instances that make it impossible for it to do so. I wish I'd written them down."

That70sshow,3bvd30,Poisonousfire,44,Thu Jul 2 13:32:20 2015 UTC,Big Hyde/Jackie fan here. Easily the best couple during the shows run. I really hated they threw it away after Season 7 just so they could do the awful Hyde being married to the stripper plot and then the Jackie/Fez relationship which was way too forced. The relationship really helped both of their characters progress.
That70sshow,3bvd30,AirJordanFan93,2,Thu Jul 2 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"I liked the married to a stripper bit, was a good 'don't have to slog the audience through the mud of will/won't they'    They didn't need it to be dirty and weird with their relationship ending...that was all for Donna and Eric to do!"
That70sshow,3bvd30,MogMcKupo,22,Thu Jul 2 15:41:40 2015 UTC,Love them. Should have ended up together in the end.

That70sshow,3bvd30,anu26,17,Thu Jul 2 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"Like a few others, probably my favorite couple on the show. Jackie and Fez didn't seem like they had any natural romantic chemistry. Jackie and Kelso were good for that time of the show but obviously their split was inevitable."
That70sshow,3bvd30,soulexpectation,10,Thu Jul 2 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"Hyde and Jackie were a great couple- my favourites parts of their seasons together involved the two of them.

I kinda feel like it was big break in Hyde's character, he hates her for so long, and then does a complete 180? Just doesn't really make sense to me."
That70sshow,3bvd30,god_is_money,2,Thu Jul 2 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"I think he just resented her because he had romantic feelings for her. Let's not forget that these characters while being fictional were still quite realistic. I would say that Hyde had to hate Jackie when she was with Michael and once they split Hyde, like many of us, seized an open opportunity (whether or not it was the ""loyal"" thing to do to Kelso)."
That70sshow,3bvd30,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"Gosh, I don't see that at all. I figured the only reason he ever hooked up with Jackie was because she was hot and he wanted to fuck her."

That70sshow,3bvd30,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"That I can see, but I was speaking more to the ""romantic feelings"" suggestion. He had those for Donna early on. But with Jackie, it worked better when she stopped talking."
That70sshow,3bvd30,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:22:20 2015 UTC,I think his hate for Jackie especially in the first season was legit. Early on none of them were all that fond of Jackie and she really was only around because of Kelso. Also there is that period at the end of Season 2 into the mid point of Season 3 where Jackie is very interested in Hyde but he wasn't at all receptive to her. I guess you could argue that based on the theory its just Hyde keeping up his tough extrior.
That70sshow,3bvd30,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:39:24 2015 UTC,When they first get together at the start of Season 5 its just because they were bored during the Summer and just started to make out. It develops into something more throughout that season though so when they break up towards the end of the season it does effect Hyde.

That70sshow,3bi73x,generalzee,8,Mon Jun 29 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially since things go back to normal after that, it's easy to see why that change went unnoticed for a while. I always felt like we were missing something in Kitty's motive there. Maybe a cut scene from the hospital, or just a plot point that got written out before filming."
That70sshow,3bi73x,generalzee,9,Mon Jun 29 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"glad im not going crazy at least.  i have noticed a few plot holes early on in the series.  for example, fez has a girlfriend very early on and with no explanation she is just gone and he starts going after jackie."
That70sshow,3bi73x,BigGreenYamo,3,Mon Jun 29 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a common sitcom trope for various significant others to just vanish without explanation sometimes. For Fez there was that girl who left the double date with Hyde early, and then later Lindsay Lohan's character basically did the same story again, substituting Hyde for Kelso."
That70sshow,3bi73x,AirJordanFan93,0,Mon Jun 29 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't either, since her being overworked is the main reason Eric doesn't leave for Madison after Red's heart attack.  Also, she's at the nursing convention, and teaches Kelso & Brooke in the parenting class."
That70sshow,3bi73x,BigGreenYamo,3,Mon Jun 29 20:27:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure she goes back to work mid way through Season 4 after she flushes Fluffy the Goldfish down the toilet.
That70sshow,3bi73x,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:57:41 2015 UTC,That explains a lot. I usually skip season 4.
That70sshow,3bi73x,generalzee,2,Tue Jun 30 01:00:44 2015 UTC,I forget the actual reason why she goes back to work. I think its either the fact shes bored or that she has no meaning in her life. For reference the episode was Season 04 Episode 14 Erics Hot Cousin. 4 episodes later you see her back at work in Leo Loves Kitty
That70sshow,3bi73x,BigGreenYamo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:05:23 2015 UTC,"I used to dislike Season 4 as well, mostly because Casey Kelso always left a bad taste in my mouth, but when I gave it another chance I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness of the writing (plus the fact that Casey is only in 4 episodes). Season 4 has since become my favorite."
That70sshow,3bi73x,AirJordanFan93,2,Tue Jun 30 09:30:55 2015 UTC,"I started skipping around season 4 last night to give it another chance, and I'm kinda warming up to it.  Also, I found the scene I'd been looking for for quite some time now. Definitely my favorite in the entire series."
That70sshow,3bi73x,generalzee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:26:41 2015 UTC,Always felt like he was in more than 4 episodes. He seems to play such a large role during the second half of that season its surprising he's only around for 4 episodes.

That70sshow,3b7r3u,chiefrios,4,Fri Jun 26 17:27:48 2015 UTC,"I think Season 4 is the best season. Eric and Donna were finally apart, which gave us a ton of new material for once. Some of the most classic and quintessential episodes are from Season 4 like the Funland episode, and the episode right after where Eric and Donna get ""Divorced"" and treat their friends like their kids. Even though a lot of fans hate seeing Donna with Casey, that was kind of the point, and he was only in 4 episodes that season (I think), and most of those were still very funny. The Yearbook episode was also a great look back on the gang and would have been a fantastic series finale if the show had actually ended (it was heavily rumored it might at the time).  Overall, Season 4 just encapsulates all the adolescent fun of the show with some slightly new twists that made it seem interesting before they just had to start making stuff up in Season 6. (Season 5 was a close second place)"
That70sshow,3b7r3u,generalzee,2,Fri Jun 26 19:07:52 2015 UTC,Season 2. I really don't know why but Season 2 has just always been my favourite. There is just something about that season especially the first half of the season before Eric and Donna finally do it that I really like.

He still gets teased for being foreign and whatnot, but let's face it, Fez was never really a main character. He was always there, but there were very little to no storylines revolving around him, so he's kind of an outlier.  It seemed like everyone was finally growing up, save for Eric; Eric was drifting, and that's why he was getting that treatment. The episode where Kelso chooses Hyde and Jackie as Betsy's godparents over Eric and Donna and the one when Eric realizes he has wasted an entire year doing nothing, they address just this."
That70sshow,3aff5n,Quixoticelixor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:30:20 2015 UTC,Good explanation. Thanks.
That70sshow,3aflmq,madboi20,5,Fri Jun 19 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"The show was brought onto the network with 7 seasons agreed to by all cast members. After the show took off and an eighth season was in the talks, Kelso and Eric both decided they wanted to move onto bigger things in their careers which is why they're mostly written out of the 8th season.  I also had mixed feelings about the 8th season but after I saw the finale, all was forgiven. I cried, Alot."
That70sshow,3aflmq,londongirl92,3,Fri Jun 19 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you will see that the popular sentiment here is that the 8th season is no where near as good as the others. A lot of people hate on Randy but my opinion is that the writers did a terrible job with everyone. I found that Fez irritated me the most.   I loved that show when it was airing and when I found it on Netflix, I watched it again. By now I have probably rewatched it four or five times. I find that I can muscle through all of the episodes except the ones where Jackie is working for the morning show and the one where they steal the fatso burger clown. The writing in that episode just makes me cringe."

While he didn't come from a ruined home like Hyde, and lived a very suburban life, he was definitely not a classic good boy or a nerd. He wouldn't hang out with Hyde and Kelso if he was. They're the kind of people who would bully the nerds. But the writers made Eric nerdier as the show progressed because they thought it was funny, but I didn't find it funny.

I mean, I know it's a comedy but didn't Charlie die there like not even a year ago.   I think you're expecting too much from this show. This show isn't a drama that mirrors real life. It is a sitcom which goes for humor more than continuity. Have you ever noticed there are way more holiday specials than the years it takes place in? Falling off the water tower was something that made That '70s Show That' 70s Show. That's why they showed it in the finale.   On Michael Kelso's Wikia it says his current wife is Brooke. I don't remember him mentioning getting married to Brooke?   It is never mentioned that he was married to Brooke.   They decided to go to Florida, in my head it was a way to wrap up the show. Did they really want to end the show with Red and Kitty going to Florida or did the audience back in '06 react badly to it so they decided to make them stay in Point Place?   I'm pretty sure this storyline was so in the finale they would show the sentimental value of point place and the house. It was mainly to add more emotion to the finale and in my opinion also just to fill in Red and Kitty's storyline in season 8.   Fez and Jackie. NO.   Agreed. Jackie and Hyde deserved to be together.   Sucks that Midge didn't make an appearance.   Why does that suck? Midge wasn't that important. Although it would've been cool that she showed up, it doesn't make a big impact that she didn't.    Sucks the feud between Fez and Fenton was never solved. Would love to find out why they hated eachother. I really thought we'd get closure.  closure on anything really. Country? Name? Last name? I'm Dutch, I'd love to hear the DUTCH name of his island. (Aruba? Bonaire? Curacao?)   Closure was very present at the end of the series. These small gags weren't meant to ever be discovered, and everyone knew that since the beginning of the series. I don't know if this is the first show you've watched, but many shows have these gags that bring comedy and jokes. Honestly, and I think many people will agree with me, I prefer to not know these things. It just wouldn't feel... right. Taking this into account, I have seen a few theories on here that say Fez might be from the Virgin Islands.  I think you're reading into this show too much. I mean, I've seen it many times but you're expecting too much realism in it. In this show you have to suspend your disbelief a little."
That70sshow,365vay,Quixoticelixor,1 point,Sat May 16 14:54:05 2015 UTC,I know every show doesn't have closure on everything. I've seen a million shows but it's just the post-show feeling that I wanna have closure on everything. I'll obviously forget about all this in a week or so.
That70sshow,365vay,AirJordanFan93,0,Sat May 16 15:25:33 2015 UTC,"On Michael Kelso's Wikia it says his current wife is Brooke. I don't remember him mentioning getting married to Brooke? Did I miss it or is it just a mistake on the page?   Kelso and Brooke never got engaged nor did they end up together. Kelso left to be closer to his daughter. It is never mentioned in the finale his status with Brooke. I chose to beleive they don't end up together.    Fez being a ladies man. NO NO NO.    Big gripe for me in the final season was this huge change with the Fez character. I kind of feel they did this to make up for the lack of Kelso while Kelso was never portrayed as a ""ladies man"" he was portrayed as someone who got girls easy and I guess Fez was the only one they could pass that off to.   Fez and Jackie. NO.   Agreed she should of gotten back together with Hyde in the final season. Especially considering you could of either not done the whole Hyde married to a stripper thing or if they still do it just get it over in an episode. The Jackie/Fez thing was forced and I guess just because Fez was the only one left she hadn't been with so they figured what the hell.    Sucks that Midge didn't make an appearance.   Eh I don't think thats a big deal. She wasn't all that important even when she was around in the earlier seasons. I know sticoms like to bring back a lot of past characters in the final season or finale but Im glad they didn't take that route."

TBH, I didn't like him either when I got to s8 the first time either because he just kind of became part of the group with little transition, but he grew on me as a tolerable character in subsequent viewings."
That70sshow,35yoe0,akaiamex,12,Thu May 14 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"Topher Grace leaving threw a wrench in the plans for season 8. I read somewhere they were going to recast Eric like they did Laurie. So, while season 8 is bad, it's not as bad as it could've been. It didn't tarnish the rest of the show, and the awfulness is at least contained to that season. I think there's some solace in that."

But now, I like it just as much as I like season 3-7. Randy's deliveries are pretty good imo. Even if his jokes themselves aren't that funny, but I blame the writers for that."
That70sshow,35wbta,HaydenHank,34,Thu May 14 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious that the gang wasn't the ""popular"" group."

That70sshow,35wbta,PM_YOUR_ONE_BOOB,3,Thu May 14 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what the show tries to get across, but it's pretty inconsistent.   I mean, Jackie's rich and pretty and she's Snow Queen in The Tornado Prom and at one point says the nerds do all her homework. Yet she's only had four boyfriends (if one could really count Chip) and after the first season or so, doesn't really seem to hang out with anyone other than the gang. Kelso is also described as extremely attractive and man candy and is basically a man-whore considered all of the girls he's banged, yet he's described as being pretty unpopular too.   Eric's skinny, but there have been a lot of girls throughout the series who find him attractive, and Donna is also described as complete babe and boy magnet. Yet they don't seem to have friends outside of the gang either.   One would assume Hyde to not be popular, being dirty and poor and aloof, but he's also had his fair share of girls. Fez is the foreign-exchange student and a horny loser, but even he's had many girlfriends, and they only get better as the show progresses. He goes from the psycho Caroline, who is quite pretty actually and nice when she isn't being crazy, then to Big Rhonda, who's a good girlfriend but she is lazy and gluttonous, then to Nina, who is usually nice and pretty but tends to be abrasive, and finally Jackie, the girl he's been courting for years. It's odd how popular they make these losers out to be."

I had been watching episodes here and there and just wondered what the finale was like. Watched it and had to go from the beginning to end. I was so emotional because by the end, you feel as though they're your family too. It's like parting with old friends. You've seen them grow and get through things and now it just ends. Kitty's emotional speech definitely helps the moment."

That70sshow,34e5vg,Quixoticelixor,12,Thu Apr 30 12:33:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. My friend just started season 8 for the first time and is actually considering stopping. It's worth it for the final episode.
That70sshow,34e5vg,Marty_McF1y,9,Thu Apr 30 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"I find it kind of see-saws. I find Season 1 and 2 to be very strong, Season 3 is 'iffy' especially near the end. I don't like season 4 very much but that's more a plot than humour reasons so I can't appraisei t fairly, season 5 is very strong, season six is ""average"", season 7 is highs and lows - a lot of it ""misses"" but there are some truly outstanding top tier moments. Season 8 is a trainwreck but the first episode or two is still good, and the finale is still satisfying (mostly)"
That70sshow,34e5vg,SexBobomb,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:02:50 2015 UTC,I also feel the same way. Though with Season 4 there are only a handful of episodes I dislike mainly after Casey comes in and starts his relationship with Donna. But other than that I think the season is fairly good.
That70sshow,34e5vg,AirJordanFan93,9,Fri May 1 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen the show more times than I can count. I think absolutely seasons 1-5 are the definitive pinnacle of the show. I still enjoy 6 and 7, though it is clear to see a steady decline and I fully understand why people don't like it.  Season 8 is definitely the leaast good out of them all, though I would still say to watch it. Personally, I don't think it's just the worst television ever, but it's definitely not the best."
That70sshow,34e5vg,dlee_75,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:29:27 2015 UTC,I would pretty much agree with this. While I don't hate 6 or 7 it is clear the decline would begin with those seasons more so 7 than 6. 6 focuses a little too much on Eric/Donna while I understand why because of the engagement they weren't great characters at this point and had been pretty much ruined already
That70sshow,34e5vg,AirJordanFan93,7,Fri May 1 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say probably in the season when Eric stayed behind because Red had a heart attack, and definitely by the time Eric took a year off."

Season 8 is pretty abysmal all-around. If its your first time through, and you love the show, you should watch it once. If you're cycling through again, I would suggest just watching the first and last episodes of that season."
That70sshow,34e5vg,generalzee,2,Thu Apr 30 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"I've never seen it before, so its all new to me. By season 3 I think a lot of the 'newness' of it is starting to fall off and the jokes are being a bit rehashed. But I'm sure it will get a second wind soon. The first 2 seasons were great.  One thing I noticed is in the first 2 seasons the characters felt quite different episode to episode, like they had different writers that weren't quite sure how they wanted them to act just yet."
That70sshow,34e5vg,generalzee,4,Thu Apr 30 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that does certainly seem to be the case. There's an especially large change after Season 1. The whole show changes format a little and some of the more dramatic elements from season 1 get downplayed in favor of comedy.  Also, you have to remember that these actors were incredibly young (especially Mila Kunis aka Jackie), and were still trying to figure out how to act properly. No offense to Laura Prepon, but at the beginning of the show she was an absolutely abysmal actress, but she really got it together during the first couple of seasons, and she's great by the end. (And went on to do some awesome roles as well)  Season 4 is my favorite season, and manages to feel original, so look forward to that!"
That70sshow,34e5vg,Horaciow14,2,Thu Apr 30 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"[SPOILERS] The show started to fall when the cast were busy doing other things. Kelso cut his hair short, Donna was blonde, Laurie is replaced, Eric and Kelso leave the show... I don't know when it starts, but the later seasons just feels like the writers start to focus on corny typical sitcom jokes rather than a good storyline. Anything before the last season is watchable."

That70sshow,344l7m,Mr_Harvey_Specter,22,Tue Apr 28 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"Oh god yes. What a whiny fucker, especially in later seasons. First two or so seasons don't bother me because he's a dumb teen but characters are supposed to grow, dammit.   Also if you are interested, the tumblr blog thestupidhelmet has several good character essays on Donna, her relationship with Eric, and Jackie and Hyde."
That70sshow,344l7m,eme_trinity,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"If you look really closely, the characters do have overall growth. However, the last season had new showrunners who hated everything that the show was building towards and then fucked it all up. I'm looking at you, Hyde/Jackie I can't even watch past the sixth season any more, the character derailment hurts me so much."
That70sshow,344l7m,eme_trinity,11,Tue Apr 28 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. You can tell that he starts making big changes in the 3rd season from what he was in the first 2 because the writers re-wrote the relationship between Eric and Donna to be ""A more traditional power couple."" Apparently traditional power couples are between a bitchy girl with unclear motivations (Donna even points out how difficult it is to understand her at some points), and a douchebag guy, which Eric clearly turns into."
That70sshow,344l7m,generalzee,7,Tue Apr 28 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, everyone in the show becomes terrible the more you watch it, except Red, Kitty, and Fez.  Oh, I guess Bob too."
That70sshow,344l7m,RiversBromo,5,Tue Apr 28 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true. I'm pretty much just watching for the Red/Kelso interactions at this point. Also the dream sequences start to get kind of dull after a while. Find myself skipping most of them."

That70sshow,33ewcs,notmike11,28,Tue Apr 21 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"I just think the show has a lot of continuity errors, that they always overlook. Wouldn't put too much thought into it."
That70sshow,33ewcs,Seiya33,8,Wed Apr 22 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what were other continuity errors? I remember thinking Donna had a sister.."
That70sshow,33ewcs,lilweber,20,Wed Apr 22 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"Donna's sister is one. And it's just minor things, like Jackie's mom being a realtor in the episode with the Keg, and then turning into Pam. Kelso is also said to have a sister at one point, and is never addressed again. Just little stuff like that."
That70sshow,33ewcs,Seiya33,18,Wed Apr 22 01:04:40 2015 UTC,"Something that people seem to forget about Donna's sister: There are two different ones mentioned/shown in two different episodes.  The first and most well known is Tina in ""Eric's Burger Job."" She is established to be 15 years old.  The other sister is only mentioned in one line of dialogue. In Episode 2 of the series (""Eric's Birthday""), when the Foremans leave the kids to party by themselves and go to the Pinciotti's, Midge tries to comfort Kitty my reading Tales From an Empty nest and says something to the effect of ""This book helped me when Valerie went off to school."" Implying that Donna has a sister in college."
That70sshow,33ewcs,dlee_75,3,Wed Apr 22 01:26:59 2015 UTC,They do make a few references to Kelso have quite a large number of siblings throughout the series. Casey is the only one we see.
That70sshow,33ewcs,AirJordanFan93,2,Wed Apr 22 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. But they're very obscure references, like the episode with Annette when she says one of Kelso's brothers took a picture as she was getting out of the shower. Eric says ""Kelso, I thought all of your brothers were out of the house""  That's pretty much it"
That70sshow,33ewcs,Seiya33,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:19:21 2015 UTC,I always thought that it was Kelso that took the picture and that Annette just thought it was one of the brothers. Or Kelso told her it was.
That70sshow,33ewcs,socrates_scrotum,2,Wed Apr 22 14:24:01 2015 UTC,Kelso did take the picture he either told it was one of his brothers or she just thought it was. That was just one of the references throughout the series about Kelso having a large number of siblings.
That70sshow,33ewcs,AirJordanFan93,3,Wed Apr 22 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"Jackie's Mom isn't a continually issue, real estate agents can make a lot of money!"
That70sshow,33ewcs,HaydenHank,5,Wed Apr 22 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, but I meant more in the sense that she had a complete personality shift. haha"
That70sshow,33ewcs,Seiya33,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"true, although did she really have a personality in that episode? She was just trying to make the sale"
That70sshow,33ewcs,HaydenHank,3,Wed Apr 22 02:50:45 2015 UTC,"Well, she seemed pretty conservative from the little that we saw. But ultimately, you're right."
That70sshow,33ewcs,Seiya33,3,Wed Apr 22 02:53:58 2015 UTC,Nope she just showed up at the end of the episode showing the house to a couple and they saw all the teens in the pool. I guess you could argue she becomes the character we saw in Season 6 after Jackies dad gets arrested in Season 5 though Kelso does note a few times in Season 5 and 6 that she did have the tendencies we saw in Season 6 while he and Jackie were dating.
That70sshow,33ewcs,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:11:45 2015 UTC,"I remember kellso claiming that he never saw dona naked desptite them swimming naked in season 1. I guess it could be explained by Kelso lying to get a look, but i would expect Donna to call him out on this."
That70sshow,33ewcs,Honza8D,8,Sat Apr 25 06:58:12 2015 UTC,"In the episode in question, Jake is about 6 years old. meaning he was born around 1977 which was the year she got menopause. So perhaps, in the alternate timeline, the Foremans were able to conceive Jake before Kitty's menopause kicked in. (I'm not sure how this stuff works so I may be completely wrong.)  Perhaps in the real timeline, some event happened that prevented the exact circumstances in which Jake was conceived in a sort of (ironically) butterfly effect way.  Just one way to mentally dismiss it.  Edit: Additionally, this theory fits in with one of the themes of the episode. That theme being, Eric and Donna's relationship affected everyone they knew in ways that Eric would have never otherwise known."
That70sshow,33ewcs,dlee_75,2,Wed Apr 22 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"You guys are forgetting that this is all a dream. Eric had no idea what a menopause was until Kitty had it so how could he have known that his mother couldn't have any other kids? He did know that his father wanted a son who was good at all the stuff that Eric was bad at, and this dream is about how much more shitty Eric's life would be."
That70sshow,33ewcs,dlee_75,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:05:40 2015 UTC,Was it really all a dream though? Was it? Was it really??
That70sshow,33ewcs,tedddywestside,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:44:35 2015 UTC,Yes?
That70sshow,33ewcs,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, no, Eric and Donna's relationship does not affect Kitty's menopause. Sure, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" showed an alternate universe, but Hyde and Donna's wedding took place in 1980. In the real world, Kitty's menopause occurred on 1977. Red doesn't even want to have kids anymore, and Kitty's aging MAY BE the reason that she had menopause."

That70sshow,338aue,Curse-10,15,Mon Apr 20 13:17:04 2015 UTC,I don't think so. You have to factor in that Red went to war in Korea during the 50s though I think they refernece a few times he served during WWII as well. Im sure Reds time away during war probably shaped how he would be as a man.
That70sshow,338aue,AirJordanFan93,5,Mon Apr 20 14:00:42 2015 UTC,True. War would have shaped Red. Maybe he will have Red traits is more like it.
That70sshow,338aue,AirJordanFan93,3,Mon Apr 20 15:30:15 2015 UTC,But who knows maybe his time in Africa shaped him in a certain way like war shaped Red. We don't know how his time in Africa affected him. But I just can't see Eric as we know him especially the latter seasons getting much of Reds personality or anything like that.
That70sshow,338aue,Jesse402,2,Mon Apr 20 15:44:35 2015 UTC,I always wondered what would have happened in the 80s. I mean the show ended but I always felt like there was still a story there.
That70sshow,338aue,MogMcKupo,3,Mon Apr 20 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"You were exactly right when you said Red traits. He will never have quite the hardened demeanor that Red carries, but he will be firm and instill some classic ""masculine"" traits into his son(s) and he will have a certain degree of ""daddy's little girl"" attitude toward his daughter(s).  But, he will be open to his feelings and expresses them. I can see him kinda being a funny-at-times, dryly-humored kinda father. He'll openly tell his kids he loves them, etc.  I think this because there are times where you can tell Eric ""gets it"" in the practical and pragmatic leadership style of his father, like when he gets the car out of the snow, interviews well with the father, comes clean to Donna about the college girl, etc."

I decided to take on this challenge as both a humongous fan of the show, and as a person with too much time on a Saturday morning.  I had very little memory of the episode surrounding this moment. I remembered that Kitty had sent Hyde to the basement to keep him out of sight for some reason. My first guess was the episode about Eric's Grandmother coming over unexpectedly one Sunday, when Eric needed to write a paper. Yeah, it's a weak concept, and honestly not one of my top episodes.   Anyway, I jumped on Netflix and found the episode ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" (Season 1 Episode 10). Kitty doesn't really ""send"" Hyde to the basement so much as she tells him to stay there around the 14 minute mark. Then there's a dining room circle until 16:20, then there's your scene."

That70sshow,31ufqo,wachachi,2,Wed Apr 8 06:47:53 2015 UTC,"I actually bought the full series of both (70's show and third rock) off amazon, no regrets. Both are fantastic!"
That70sshow,31ufqo,SidJenkins,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:27:40 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a pretty loose definition of similar, but maybe try Friday Night Dinner or Skins (the first generation -seasons 1 and 2 - is really good)."
That70sshow,31ufqo,78383-872937,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:05:42 2015 UTC,"3rd rock has always stood out to me as one of the smartest shows of its type out there. (past and present.)   each episode is usually about dick and the gang figuring out some sort of social norm (for lack of a better word) which is perfect because they aren't human. this is a really simple and straightforward idea, but they executed it perfectly, episode after episode."
That70sshow,31ufqo,AwkwardKid94,3,Wed Apr 8 15:17:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. And it makes you realize just how weird our norms can be. I like it

That70sshow,31ufqo,chelbski-willis,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:08:36 2015 UTC,Id say GFL is probably the most logical follow on from That 70's Show. I think the fact its done by the same production company makes it feel familiar. Also the fact a handful of the cast show up in cameo roles connects it that little bit more. Also you see the Water Tower minus the pot leaf in the episode with Ashton Kutcher in it.
That70sshow,31ufqo,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't know it was the same production company, but that makes perfect sense. It was the music that reminded me of That 70's Show. I haven't gotten to the episode with Ashton in it, I'll keep an eye out for the tower!"
That70sshow,31ufqo,gabijohnny,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:16:26 2015 UTC,It only shows up in the one episode with Ashton in it but you will recognize it. The series doesn't really hit its stride until the Third Season when it was picked up by the WB.

Maybe use a plot line like Donna and Eric's kid is graduating or Jackie and Hyde got back together and their kid is graduating or something. Just give us a once and done update that fits with the aging of the actors so we get a few more quotes and gloss over the Randy episodes"

That70sshow,31n5pq,kzcatlady,9,Mon Apr 6 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you on the Fez/Jackie thing. It didn't make any sense. Fez is the type of guy Jackie would WANT to want, but wouldn't actually have feelings for. Jackie and Hyde were clearly perfect for each other and I think they ought to have ended up together."
That70sshow,31n5pq,bbdeluxe,6,Mon Apr 6 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY! I was so happy when he said, ""You don't want me, you're just lonely right now! You'll leave me as soon as someone better comes along."" And that's exactly what she would do!"
That70sshow,31n5pq,Quixoticelixor,7,Mon Apr 6 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Jackie and Hyde were the most perfect relationship in the whole series, more so than Donna / Eric. Donna and Eric were great, but they were too static. Hyde and Jackie actually did stuff and their adventure together was really entertaining. When Samantha showed up it pissed me off; Jackie and Hyde were meant to be.   I hated Randy, though. Mainly because he interfered with the defining relationship of the show and the one most of the stories revolved around. Randy's character just felt unnatural and overall... forced. He was 'necessary' to the show according to the writers but it would've gone just fine without him. Donna and Eric are so obviously meant to be together that that relationship had grown with the show just like we did throughout all 8 seasons.  Fez's character was really changed for the worse in season 8 in many ways. He became a ladies man, which paved the way for some really funny story lines, but also created a really creepy and awkward position for Fez to be in."
That70sshow,31n5pq,tedddywestside,3,Tue Apr 7 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"• Even Danny Masterson agrees with you, man. He says that Season 8 had bad writing, and who wouldn't agree with him? • On the Randy part, I actually don't have a problem with Josh Meyers since he personally is a great actor and a good guy. It's just the way he played Randy or the lines given to him were definitely unfunny. It just wasn't the same without Topher and Ashton there. To be honest, Charlie was a much better replacement....until they killed him off since Bret Harrison got another sitcom offer. • Jackie and Fez were totally bugging me while getting through Season 8. The whole show, Jackie didn't even like Fez, but Fez always had a thing for Jackie. After Kelso bails on Jackie, she fell for Hyde. After running away to Chicago with Kelso after she gives Hyde an ultimatum, they break-up eventually after Hyde drunkenly marries a stripper. Then, she doesn't have a place to live and doesn't have a boyfriend, so she settles for Fez instead?!  God, the eighth season is just so messed up."
That70sshow,31n5pq,boblablaugh,3,Fri Apr 24 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"I am with you on Randy. I didn't hate him. I hated the writing. I always point out the episode where they steal the fatso burger clown. Donnna gets all stupid when they commit vandalism and crime. They write it so it comes off as so completely out of character for her to be involved. I don't get that. She was in the car when Eric was going to trench that guys yard etc... I can't even watch that episode.  I love that show and can even watch some of the episodes in that season but I refuse to accept Jackie and Fez. It shouldn't have happened. If not Hyde, it should have just been left alone. There is nothing wrong with a single Jackie..."
That70sshow,31n5pq,boblablaugh,3,Mon Apr 6 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I hated that episode. (And going back to season one - she was totally all for Eric & the guys streaking when the President was in town.)   I know, I honestly don't know why they couldn't have just left Jackie (and arguably even Donna) single. I mean, if her and Hyde couldn't be together.   It was almost like they wrote the Jackie/Fez story before they decided to have Hyde's stripper wife leave, and then were too lazy to go back and fix it."
That70sshow,31n5pq,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"The president episode is a perfect example. Plus it was one of the first episodes of the show ever. I have heard that the writers were pissed off about something and let it show in their writing. I don't know if that is entirely true, but it is obvious that something happened. The writing and acting abruptly changes in that season."
That70sshow,31n5pq,AirJordanFan93,3,Mon Apr 6 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"No shit...    Jackie - all of a sudden - because Donna plants the idea in her head after her stupid list - is into Fez now? Fez - total ladies man (a different hook up literally every day?)  Donna - kleptomaniac, to deal with her Eric issues?    yeah, you're definitely right about the changes."
That70sshow,31n5pq,tektonnic,2,Mon Apr 6 23:48:18 2015 UTC,I agree with Jackie and Hyde. I think they probably are my favorite of the couples during the series run yes I like them more than Donna and Eric. But they both made each other better people especially Jackie she became a much better person during her relationship with Hyde. The Fez thing in the final season felt so forced and I honestly think they did it so Jackie would end up with all but one of the male group. The whole stripper wife thing was completely dumb and didn't produce anything all that good. To think they canned one of the shows best things from its second half of existence to just do a stupid story like that shows they were running out of steam at that point.   Fez is the worst thing about that final season. His character was completely destroyed in that year. The whole suave ladies man gimmick doesn't work for him at all. Then the change int he voice is something bothers me as well. Then there is his whole turning down Jakie despite the fact he spent the majority of the series or at least the early seasons wanting to be with her and then now hes just like screw that. Fez was always one of the great characters on the show but his role in the final season is just damn awful and has very little redeeming factors to it if any.   I don't hate Randy like a lot of people do. I know that a lot of people hate the idea he was bought in as a replacement for Eric and they hate the Randy/Donna relationship a lot. While I don't hate Randy I still feel Brett Harrison as Charlie should of been kept on. I just felt he was a more natural replacement for Eric and then you can still bring Randy on and have him take Kelso' spot after Ashton left the series.   To sum up Jackie and Fez should of never happened they should of kept her and Hyde together or just kept her single. As for the rest of my points Those are just some my gripes about the season in whole. At this point I just accept the final season for what it is and think to myself it should of ended one year earlier than it did.

That70sshow,31n5pq,coji98,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:22:14 2015 UTC,The Charlie thing is just a personal preference for me. Harrison had just finished up Grounded for Life when he would of filmed his scenes at the end of season 7 and I always felt it would make sense for him to because a regular in the final season.

That70sshow,31kf5o,Zaveno,2,Mon Apr 6 14:06:30 2015 UTC,If your up to a third re-watch then there really isn't any point having to sit through 8 again if you don't like it.   I don't have it as much as a lot of people here do. It has its issues and its clearly a major step down from where the series had been to that point but I take it for what it is. There are very few redeeming things about that season and no real memorable episodes or moments.
That70sshow,31kf5o,AirJordanFan93,2,Mon Apr 6 05:37:40 2015 UTC,Only scene that makes me laugh in season 8 is fez's exchange with bob at fatso burger haha

I find it rather boring, i guess the return of Eric at the last few minutes is nice, but i don’t think few minutes can save the episode.  If i had to pick the perfect ending episode, it would be end of season 5 when they graduated. I feel the show should have ended when they left school, it went downhil since."

Hyde got married which changed his character dynamic. Plus his wife sucked. Donna got that annoying puppy love. Randy was boring as hell.

I thought his character was something great for the balance of the show.  my problem with Randy is that he was Eric's replacement, in more ways than one.  I agree with you on the relationship, Donna pretty much just decides ""for some reason I like this guy that we just met more than the guy I've liked since we were kids, and Eric will find out sooner or later, too bad for him, since he left for a few months.""  on top of that, he was supposed to fill the time that Kelso would have taken as well, and essentially replacing both of those characters is way too much for him to have done with what his character was supposed to be.  I think Randy would have been fine if he wasn't trying to be the new central focus of the show and replace two characters."

That70sshow,30rdfy,kzcatlady,2,Mon Mar 30 19:30:47 2015 UTC,Eric in seasons 6 and 7 is pretty damn obnoxious as a character. I feel they tried a little too hard to push the fact hes a nerd in those seasons. In the earlier seasons it was always hinted at and implied hes a nerd but those 2 seasons they felt the need to turn it up to 11 and just go with it. The Eric character really took a dive after Season 5.

They could've just focussed more on the what was left of the main cast and actually DEVELOPING them instead of downgrading them. Donna should've accomplished something with her feminism or get accepted in a great college in Florida. The ending for Hyde was the best though. He stayed at the Forman's and he had his own record store, had a real dad finally.  Fez going back to his homecountry could've been pretty satisfying too.  Jackie should've gotten a job in a magazine or something. They should've stretched the Christina st. George storyline and not fired her but make her in charge of something.

I do not like the Fez/Jackie angle and I can not stand the Fatso burger episode because of the way Donna acts in it. I can't put my finger on it but the way she gets so into doing vandalism is cringey. Not because she is into it but more because it seems as if she has never done anything crazy before.

It's one of those shows I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it (something only King of Queens, New Adventures of Old Christine, Big Bang Theory, and Cougar Town has been able to achieve)  I agree with you on Randy.

Eric would of been pretty much the same that he would of been kind of a loaner, but I'd hope they still write it in the Foreman's basement.

That70sshow,2xzmi4,drknight,5,Thu Mar 5 10:30:55 2015 UTC,"The one thing I will comment on here is the last sentence (because I think everyone agrees with the rest). I don't think Topher, himself, had a lot of influence on the show. I think Season 8 was a disaster because of all the pieces that fell out of place. Without Eric AND Kelso, the writers were forced to write their parts onto other characters, and they chose poorly.   Instead of giving us Charlie from Season 7 to replace Eric (who would have worked because he was timid, but just stupid enough to go along with the group), they wrote Eric's character into Donna (Why does she act so overexcited when they steal the Fatso Burger clown? Why is she such an awkward dork with Randy? The writers were writing her to be a female Eric).   Then when Kelso left, there was an even bigger hole in the cast. Kelso kept everything light, turning any tragedy into a laugh line. What we liked about his character was his stubborn optimism, his relentless nature, and his goofy ideas. I don't think anyone really cared that he was a ""ladies' man"" except in how that helped the situations get far more ridiculous. The writers ignored this, and decided to write Kelso's character out to FEZ of all people (probably the least well-suited to be Kelso's replacement). Did they give Fez all the optimism, relentlessness, and good nature of Kelso? No, they made him a petty, pessimistic ladies' man whose love connection with Jackie makes no sense whatsoever.  Then, realizing they were short on characters, they added in Randy, but since Kelso and Eric's parts had already been parsed out to Fez and Donna respectively, they were left with nothing to give him, and nothing he became."

Hyde grounded Jackie and got her to think about real life instead of a fantasy, and Jackie inspired Hyde to get off his ass and do something with his life.

That70sshow,2vex47,thahalomilitia,21,Tue Feb 10 13:21:50 2015 UTC,"The show went through significant changes in the first 2 seasons where they re-wrote a lot of the parts, and dropped some of the extreaneous ones. Remember how Jackie's parents were both on-screen characters in Season 1, but they completely recast Jackie's mom when she came back and was supposed to be extraordinarily hot, and Jackie's Dad was never seen again. In fact, in an episode where he should have been an on-screen character they just used a POV shot to show him choking Kelso (A technique they later recycled for writing off Big Rhonda).  The main point being that there are some serious continuity issues in this show."

In season 1 she was a real estate agent in The Keg and she shows off the house where they hold The Keg Party when the party is going on. Then when she comes back in Season 6 recast as Brooke Shields shes pretty much a drunk and kind of a whore or at least very easy.

That '70s Show is a show about family life in the '70s that aired in the '90s.

That70sshow,2uwuy5,MaxLemon,3,Fri Feb 6 02:57:41 2015 UTC,I agree and would add that the worst thing she did was go to the wedding with Seth Green as his date. He was clearly trying to fuck her and she treated Eric like shit for pointing out the obvious truth and objecting to it. They were engaged at the time! What a bitch! It's funny that the characters on the show act like Jackie is the biggest bitch but it was always Donna.
That70sshow,2uwuy5,letsgoblues,2,Fri Feb 6 18:07:07 2015 UTC,Man that was plenty. Completely accurate too!
That70sshow,2uwuy5,TerryOn,8,Fri Feb 6 05:57:26 2015 UTC,"That write-up paints Eric as someone who can do no wrong which is not at all accurate. Some of the points I agree with (such as Eric being her second choice after Casey dumps her), but you also have to think about how things are difficult for her, having to deal with her parents' divorce. She's human and entitled to make SOME mistakes, especially given her circumstances. In fact, I would say she is pretty patient  and understanding when it comes to  Eric's antics.   I liked Donna's character, although not as much as the rest of the gang. My issue with her development, however, is how she ended up staying in Point Place. Donna was established as a smart girl with many inspirations, one of which was getting out of Point Place. This is at least part of the reason why she did not accept Eric's promise ring. She knew that she wanted to have many interesting life experiences (including going to college), so it would be unfair for her to accept Eric's promise ring because she simply did not know what the future held for their relationship.  In my opinion, it was completely unlike her character to skip out on Madison, instead opting to DJ rather than go to college. Later, put in a deposit for the trailer, which she had no business doing. The Donna presented to us in seasons prior would hate that situation, and she certainly would not be the one facilitate it. Eric figured this out and ended up not showing up to their wedding. Eventually, by the end of Season 7, she was the one that was stuck in Point Place, not having much going on in her life, while Eric ironically left to Africa to pursue his dreams. I couldn't really take her character seriously in Season 8 because it just didn't make sense for her to turn out the way she did."
That70sshow,2uwuy5,drivin12,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:59:02 2015 UTC,"I can see why she stayed when Eric didn't go to college, but to be honest, after he left, I'm surprised she didn't decide to go earlier (granted, Laura Prepon was supposed to stay in the show). It wasn't until Eric was coming back that she indeed decided to go on and do what she needed."
That70sshow,2uwuy5,AwkwardKid94,5,Fri Feb 6 05:08:39 2015 UTC,"The way he read into the whole series and Donna's character is really off for me. The main thing I didn't care for was his rationale of the wedding scene. Eric had so many opportunities and didn't know how to tell her. It's not her fault that he ended up skipping out before she did. That was one thing that drove me crazy: Neither of them wanted to talk about the elephant in the room-not feeling ready.   Unfortunately, I myself cannot really 100% agree with everything only because I saw Eric as a major jerk-wad at times, especially early on (Even posted a question on this subreddit about it) and it just seemed like he was all about him and only him."
That70sshow,2uwuy5,AwkwardKid94,9,Fri Feb 6 05:11:38 2015 UTC,"I've watched the entire series from start to finish almost ten times (yes, ten, 10)   And this guy's post is peppered with inaccuracies."

That whole scene is fantastic and seeing Red that mad is just too damn funny.  Second one is the Funland episode. At the end, Red takes Eric out for a few drinks and tells him the story of how he got over his first love. It's a really heartfelt scene between a father and son and it's really stuck out to me these past few years."
