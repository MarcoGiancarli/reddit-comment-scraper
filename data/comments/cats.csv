Thankfully, neighbor cat is ok. My cat had to have a bath, though, and was HIGHLY DISPLEASED).   As a result, the cat hates me and loves him."

cats,3e2zbb,tikitessie,6,Tue Jul 21 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"Aww! This is so touching. We had our own ""Miss Hissy"" until we had to move, a while back. A nearby neighbor promised to keep feeding her, but unfortunately in the three years with us, she never got tame enough to get taken out of the wild - and more importantly, our own 2 cats were still really hostile towards her. I think of her often and hope she's well. It makes me so happy to see others reaching out to strays or feral kitties in their area! It's better for them, better for the environment, and just overall so enriching. Keep it up, OP! She looks like she's looking for love :)"
cats,3e2zbb,drink_your_tea,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"I love that name! We call this one Mama because she showed up at our back door with three kittens in tow about a month ago. Shortly after the kitten sightings, she was trapped by a neighbor, spayed, and held inside a screen porch while she healed and eventually released. The kittens continued to come by our back door for a few more days with whom we presume to be their father but then they just stopped visiting. We don't know what happened to the kittens, but the male cat continued to visit. Finally, about two weeks ago, we found both Mama and the male cat at our back door eating the food we put out.  The male continues to eat and run, but Mama spends most of her days sleeping in the shade on our porch. She's very curious about our three indoor cats. Our one female cat is still aggressive towards her through the glass. The boys just like to stare at her or ignore her. We're almost at the point where I can scoop her up and take her to the vet for a comprehensive check up and care. After the check up we will try to gradually introduce her inside our home. I doubt we will ever make her an indoor cat. She also needs a better name."
cats,3e2zbb,BraveLilTurtles,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Females tend to be aggressive toward other females, males are generally more accepting. YMMV as all cats are different, but it doesn't surprise me that your indoor girl isn't keen on her."
cats,3e2zbb,lowrunna,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our indoor girl is also a tough girl from the streets. She's still has some feral qualities."
cats,3e2zbb,Corky_Butcher,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of this info! I'm really glad to hear she's been spayed already, and that you're getting her ready to be brought to the vet, too. That's fantastic compassion by your whole neighborhood - definitely warms the cockles of my heart :)   I hope your other lady kitty eventually lets her relax a little inside, and I get what you mean that she may never really be an indoor cat... but how lovely for her that she's found this loving care, and a safe place to be with plenty of food and lovings, even if she never becomes fully domesticated and/or indoor cat!  ""Mama"" is as good of a name as any ;) You can always call her Mamacita or Mimmy or anything else you fancy! Most of our cats have ended up with weird/spur-of-the-moment names that have just stuck, including ""Señor Gato"" and ""Kotchka"" (""cat"" in Czech... so original).   Also, I'm so impressed that she's warmed up so much in just 2 weeks! Miss Hissy took months to get to be able to be touched, and even then, she really only liked my mom - I'd feed her, but didn't feel that I was welcomed to touch her. She really must be so happy to find this wonderful safe haven, and really eager for affection, if she's already rubbing your legs.  Aww, this is so sweet and just makes me so happy. Keep us posted!"

cats,3dyirf,emememaker73,9,Mon Jul 20 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Probably not that cross, more likely a long haired colour pointed domestic cat. Maine Coons don't have the colour pointed gene so will never produce a colour pointed kitten whatever they are bred to."
cats,3dyirf,Thestolenone,13,Mon Jul 20 16:41:21 2015 UTC,The parents are both pure bred. The father is a Himalayan and the mother is an all black Maine coon. He's getting the little pointed ear fuzz that the Maine coons have and the seal points of his daddy. 4 of the other 10 kittens in the litter were all black with little white paws like the mother
cats,3dyirf,ysengrimus,17,Mon Jul 20 17:44:55 2015 UTC,The parents are both pure bread.    Brings a new meaning to cat breading.

Of course there are downsides to specialized rescues, mainly that some of them are run by completely neurotic1 people who want you to treat the cat better than yourself, and they don't usually have kittens, but most of them are run by perfectly lovely people and almost none of them charge more than $150-$200, even for quite rare cats.  1 one I contacted about a Siamese wanted to specify what brands of food I would be allowed to buy for the cat and said I can't take the cat out of state and and and ... sheesh."

cats,3dzz04,darlingnikki2245,5,Mon Jul 20 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"To my dearest friend.  I stood by your bed last night; I came to have a peep.  I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.  I spoke to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  ""It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here.""  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""   You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.  Be patient, live your journey out...then come home to me.  -Author unknown"

Your heart can be empty because you can’t see her, Or you can be full of the love that you shared. You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday, Or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. You can remember her and only that she is gone, Or you can cherish her memory and let it live on.

cats,3dznxj,kelzflame,7,Mon Jul 20 20:50:15 2015 UTC,"A fitting name, considering her species. Adorable."
cats,3dznxj,Pusciferrr,5,Mon Jul 20 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"She has such an innocent face, though I'm sure she'll cause havoc once she's settled in!"
cats,3dznxj,senmyad,5,Tue Jul 21 01:53:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure she will too! But that's part of the fun of a cat, right? :)"
cats,3dznxj,StarFuryG7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"She looks like quite a character in that picture, but it could also be she's apprehensive about you, which would be understandable.  How old is she, and how has she reacted to her original family leaving her?  Poor thing. The whole thing probably has her feeling confused and abandoned, but she's cute. Good luck with her and be patient. She may act out some because the family she's known is suddenly gone."
cats,3dznxj,StarFuryG7,3,Tue Jul 21 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"She's about a year old, and aside from being a little freaked out about being in a new place, she's doing pretty good. :)"
cats,3dznxj,StarFuryG7,3,Tue Jul 21 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"A year old is not bad at all. You have a very young cat that should adjust easier than an older cat that had been with her peeps for a while and then lost them. It would be a much harder adjustment for an eight-year old cat than one that's only about a year old.  Sweet of you to adopt her rather than letting her be brought to a shelter, which could well have meant certain doom for her."
cats,3dznxj,Hashtaglibertarian,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I couldn't let her go to a shelter. And she was only living with my friends for about 6 months, so hopefully she can adjust quickly."
cats,3dznxj,StarFuryG7,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, give her a few days, maybe a week, and I think all will be fine.  Give her a few gentle pats on the head for me.  And best of luck to you both!"
cats,3dznxj,nancyaw,7,Tue Jul 21 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for being a known figure to adopt her. She is truly lucky to go to a home with a big heart.   On a second note - I HATE when people move and don't take their pets. Seriously. I'd raver go homeless than lose my cats/dog. I've gotten married, had a baby, switched jobs, moved three times in one year before and I still kept my fucking pets. I volunteer at a shelter (no kill!) and we get pets that are 18 years old that get kicked out because people ""move"" and ""can't have pets"" at their new apartment. Well then FIND ANOTHER FUCKING APARTMENT.   Rant over. Thank you again for being a good soul. She will forever trust you as her hero."
cats,3dznxj,Manty5,3,Tue Jul 21 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with pets that are up there in age especially, I don't know how some people can be so heartless as to do that shit. I could never move and just give up my pets either."
cats,3dznxj,Manty5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"I hope so! She's still getting used to the new place, but she's been out exploring the apartment some at least! :)"

cats,3dznxj,foolishDoughnut,5,Tue Jul 21 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you! She's a little skittish right now, so she's spent all day hiding under the couch. Still warming up to the new place."
cats,3dznxj,StarFuryG7,4,Tue Jul 21 00:34:40 2015 UTC,Change of place can sometimes be even more traumatic than change of owner for cats.

cats,3e32qp,StarFuryG7,3,Tue Jul 21 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, look, no offense, and I have no idea what kind of a setup you have there obviously, but my solution would be to prevent her from getting out there at all. I'd nail the window shut if I had to, because if she's already fallen and survived at least twice, her luck will probably run out soon, perhaps even on her next fall.  Don't let her out there."

If this happened recently, please contact a vet and ask what symptoms you should be looking for. A very small amount that you did not notice can be fatal. A vet will be able to determine risk and your next course of action.   Edit: If this happened ages ago, no worries, but seriously if this has happened recently, please call a vet. If your cat is drooling- or exhibiting any odd behavior go the vet immediately."

Out of nowhere, this super loveball orange kitten (maybe six months old) came up and started loving on me. I didn't want to take him in, because I had an evil genius girl cat who had already proven that she HATED other cats.   Short version, took the orange kitten in instead of letting him freeze. Girl cat despised him until the day she died. He was a really great cat. He was just a big dumb happy shit, and his life related that."

cats,3dvroo,teruma,128,Mon Jul 20 07:02:43 2015 UTC,"Story that no one carrs about time!  1 week before I was set to move, I found a 3 week old kitten stuck in someone's engine. I wanted to keep it, but I wasnt allowed to have pets in my current residence. My next residence wouldn't mind, so I only had to worry about the one week.  Because she was so small and I was still trying to furiously pack, I built a decent sized cage for her, roughly a meter cubed, to help keep her contained and limit the spread of fur.   That first night, she howled whenever we'd start to fall asleep. She'd calm right down as soon as we held her, but she'd pick up again a few minutes later. Not wanting to deal with it anymore, I enacted the first solutionto pop into my head.  I crawled into the damn cage and slept there. She didnt say another word all evening."

When your fosters get adopted the best way to fill that hole in your heart is immediately picking up a new batch of fosters.  It's also the only way to have kittens that never turn into cats.

All babies will be de-sexed by four months and we won't have a repeat of kittens, at least with this bunch. The people adopting the kittens have been coming to visit frequently, so they are attached and involved. It's the best a bad situation can be!   I'm glad we could open our home to foster as it gave my kid and his friends a very sweet experience in gentle kindness and the fragile nature of wee baby animals. It's also a very strong lesson in how many cats one pair of cats can make over time, and how difficult it is to find homes for kittens. We will end the summer with a visit to the humane society shelter to see just how many cats and kittens don't get to find homes.   Spay and neuter!"

cats,3dvroo,light_is_life,4,Mon Jul 20 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"There was originally 3, but one passed away a week ago :/ one of them never cries and then this little guy is always crying."
cats,3dvroo,kimmyuuki,3,Mon Jul 20 13:22:29 2015 UTC,"Oh no! RIP little first one! Does your organization have a vet to go through? (The one I worked with had free vet care through a contracted vet.) If he is really crying all the time and the other one not at all, do you think it could be a medical issue? I don't know how old they are, but is the mom around too? I would contact your foster supervisor if you have one, and ask them if they should get checked out. (Could also check ASPCA training articles and Jackson Galaxy and other cat behaviorist sites for info on possible medical issues or if this is just normal for tiny kittens. I never fostered any quite this young...I'm sorry I can't problem solve for you!)"
cats,3dvroo,FoxRaptix,4,Mon Jul 20 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! However it was at like 2am when I realized it was struggling to breathe so I gave it CPR (I'm pet certified) but it didn't make it. They go to the vet every 4 days so I doubt it's a medical thing. It's okay, honestly some kittens are just stubborn :p"
cats,3dvroo,serizzzzle,3,Mon Jul 20 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh! I can't even imagine...it's wonderful that you even knew how to save that kitten's life, even though it didn't make it. Poor thing. And you're right, I had some very stubborn, vocal kitties when I was fostering. (Like I said, none that young though! So it's useful for me to learn!) They are so lucky to have you! I'm glad it's not a medical thing. I hope they go to wonderful homes soon. :)"

cats,3e3210,kittenowner,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"The only thing you can do is get them in the same room together and have them size each other up. Try putting the new cat in the same room as the other two, but still in his carrier. He'll hiss, they'll hiss, it's a phase you have to get through. Always supervise these encounters. Eventually, take the new cat out of his carrier, let him be around the other cats. They'll be stressed around each other for a bit but eventually they'll get used to each other. All you need is a whole lot of patience."
cats,3e3210,kayleigh666,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"Its not so much the hissing, it's the growling thats scaring me. My brother says he's never heard him growl before. I clipped my cats claws so if they fight, there won't be as much damage; but he's too freaked out to do his. And he still smells like the fire. He wouldn't let them bathe him. I closed off one of my rooms just to let him get out the carrier and get used to the house. Its the room they spend the most time in. I was hoping the smell would help him acclimate."
cats,3e3210,kayleigh666,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"That'll definitely help, yeah. Growling and hissing usually go hand in hand, I find. I've taken in a couple of strays over the past year and my cats have done some growling and hissing. They usually get over it though."
cats,3e3210,BraveLilTurtles,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'm awfully glad you were able to take care of your dad's cat.  That must have been an awful day for your family, and having even one cat survive must be a comfort.    Is he able to wear a collar?  If yes, you might give the calming pheromone collars a try.  We've had decent luck with some of our fosters and the collars - maybe 60% success.  It isn't a cure-all, but it can help calm them down enough to make introductions a little more successful.    Good luck.  I'm so sorry your family is going through this.  I lost my mother in a house fire last year, and know something about the pain.  Hang in there."
cats,3dzqm9,MushroomGoats1,3,Mon Jul 20 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"No way, I do the same thing, and give them names! Glad to know I'm not the only one who does this!"

cats,3dzqm9,StarFuryG7,2,Tue Jul 21 05:32:13 2015 UTC,Haha I've been called that once or twice. I just think I'm patient and willing to sit quietly near animals until they're ready to approach me. That's how I got close to the family of deer that comes through my yard anyway.
cats,3dzqm9,Snicklesnack,2,Tue Jul 21 05:49:33 2015 UTC,I too know the joys of befriending the local cats! Whenever I go on walks I keep my head swiveling for cats under cars and bushes. Only a few are willing to visit though. It amazes me how much joy I get from such a small interaction.
cats,3dzqm9,DivinePrince2,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"When me and my sister go on our walk, there is a cat that always comes to meet us. He's a really muscular black cat. he always makes sure we both get to pet him equally. The person who owns the cat must think we are weirdos when we come by and stop to pet him for a while. lol"
