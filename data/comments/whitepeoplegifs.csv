whitepeoplegifs,3cwyb3,ki-yoshi,14,Sat Jul 11 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"Well, this is a part of a big ad campaign by swedish electronics store NetonNet. It began with them getting the Backstreet Boys to sing a modified version of Larger Than Life, called Lager Than Life. In Swedish ""Lager"" basically means storage. NetonNets ""thing"" is that they combine their stores with their storage, so you buy stuff from the same place that they pick their online orders. And therefore the modified song Lager Than Life.  Now they are continuing that campaign with a spoof of a Swedish TV series called ""Så mycket bättre"" (so much better), where they get a bunch of artists together and they cover each others songs. So now NetonNet are doing their spoof of this show and all the artists are covering Lager than Life (the modified song that they got Backstreet Boys to make).  A more condensed explanation from /u/mazerfaka regarding the Lager Than Life video:   It's a Swedish company called Net on net, they sell electronics online, and their motto is that it's cheaper if you buy it from the storage and not a store, and ""lager"" means storage in Swedish. So ""lager than life"" is a pun/play on words! Really cool commercial and this song is now a big hit in Sweden, again thanks to the commercial!"

whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,Papa_Jeff,40,Mon Jul 6 05:39:28 2015 UTC,Theres something seriously unsettling about this.
whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,acmercer,6,Mon Jul 6 02:00:47 2015 UTC,I was definitely expecting something like the Aphex Twin face.

whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,tommit,135,Mon Jul 6 14:51:33 2015 UTC,At least give credit to the subreddit /r/me_irl you stole both the gif and the title from
whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,OfficerTwix,82,Mon Jul 6 00:46:06 2015 UTC,/u/gallow_boob posted it over there so it's fine  Edit: his name doesn't have underscore
whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,LacidOnex,11,Mon Jul 6 01:34:44 2015 UTC,I like how you edited it but didn't fix it. Make them work for it :D

whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,antigravity21,14,Mon Jul 6 02:31:19 2015 UTC,He reposts a lot of shit that I wouldn't see otherwise.  Reposts are a necessary evil.
whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,Sir_Leminid,2,Mon Jul 6 13:11:06 2015 UTC,Why isn't his account there anymore? I thought that people only delete their accounts when they're hated by most of reddit...
whitepeoplegifs,3c8mlx,OfficerTwix,13,Mon Jul 6 02:32:29 2015 UTC,I messed his name up there's no underscore
