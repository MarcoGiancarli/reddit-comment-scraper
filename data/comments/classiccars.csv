classiccars,3duzb6,CapaciousRichards,3,Sun Jul 19 21:30:39 2015 UTC,Even less than that. Just a light scuff and trim paint. Did it ten years ago and some of it is a bit thin now but for a very cheap spray bomb it's stood up amazingly well. It's a driver so she gets the odd rock chip here and there but the body paint chips off (ouch) deeper than the trim.

classiccars,3dsv59,quarterwitty,2,Sun Jul 19 09:16:13 2015 UTC,"I just did some looking and as far as I can tell ""tudor"" and ""fordor"" seem to just be gimmicky contracted names that Henry (or his marketing team) came up with. I guess since they were making three sedan bodies they wanted an easy way to differentiate them to what was at the time a largely uneducated and illiterate customer base without embarrassing anyone. So they ended up with Tudor, Fordor, and Centerdoor. Makes sense to me, and makes me miss the days of simple names for simple cars."

classiccars,3d9j9m,na4ion1,2,Tue Jul 14 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"The trans is a fluid coupling and while it could lock up, as in weld together due to overheating, it's not likely, but is possible. And even if it did, a lot of parts would have to lock up, not just 2.   At this point, well, way before this point most mechanics would have tossed in the towel and pulled out the motor. I don't know if older mopar have bolts not studs on the converter, but if one of those backs out, it can lock up the motor. A frozen oil pump can cause it not to turn over. It's old, but if like newer mopar they used a drive shaft that can be removed and take the oil pump out of the picture.   You shouldn't be able to turn the cam by hand, you mean with a big wrench on it? The oil pump runs off the cam, so that would take that out of it, of course the cam could be snapped in half, that does happen, valves bend and hit pistons, but you said you had the ""top"" off. The top includes heads. Buying any parts is foolish until you find what is broken. So, unless a bolt has vibrated to the flywheel to stop it, you should just pull the motor and go through it, at least pull the heads."
classiccars,3d9j9m,Dinahmoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:44 2015 UTC,thank you. first off. also i am very persistent :).    the oil pump is indeed run by a shaft. i didn't pull it all the way out because i wasn't sure it any other small gears or what not would fall out of alignment. maybe tonight when i get home i will jack it up and pull it out. there is also only a tiny hole to shine a light up into the flywheel area which makes it tough to see if anything is jammed. i have also had the heads off and while they were off you could pop the key for a bit and they all moved just fine in their cylinders. even the cross hatch looked good. maybe i had cam/crank mixed up. the top gear is the one i could turn with the chain off. this is obviously before i changed it.
classiccars,3d9j9m,Dinahmoe,2,Tue Jul 14 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, the rotating assembly did fine when the head were off. There is an excellent chance you have the timing off and the valves are hitting the pistons. This is where one of the inspection scopes would come in real handy. How did you adjust the valves? I'm guessing it is mechanical lifters, you have to turn the motor over to adjust them. You should have seen something funky if out of time.   But you really shouldn't be able to turn the cam by hand, you have 16 valve springs of tension on there. I don't know the old stuff well enough, but there aren't a whole lot of different ways to drive an oil pump. It should have a hex rod driven off the cam or distributor. Newer mopar has an intermediate shaft that runs off the cam with a slot for the distributor drive. You shouldn't have any problem pulling from underneath.   There should be an inspection plate for access to the converter bolts, unless the get them from the starter hole. You might be able to take a pic in the hole to see what it looks like. I do that a lot for blind shit."
classiccars,3d9j9m,Dinahmoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:26 2015 UTC,this is what the rocker assembly looks like. kind of dark and disreguard the green text. that was before it was cleaned and put back together.
classiccars,3d9j9m,Dinahmoe,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, those are non adjustable hydraulic valves. You wouldn't have adjusted them.   Pulling the oil pump is probably the easiest, see if it's seized. I read that there are studs on the torque converter like normal, but it still could bind. Later mopar had lots of problems with the flex plate cracking. Again, don't know the old stuff off hand. Just keep digging till you find what is locking up the block."

You can get a nice one for $20-30K in some places and VERY VERY nice ones for $50-60K.    Is it numbers matching? Whats it a frame up restore? If not, how does the under body look? Etc, etc, etc. You should probably find an appraiser who specializes in classics and get it appraised. Then go from there on where to sell it. Auction is a good option to get more than what you want, or get nothing at all. Listing it on popular forums and ebay is a good way to get the word out that it's for sale. Going to car shows is another way."

I called the guy within 2 hours of of the ad being posted, I looked at the car the next day and took it home.  You have to be ready because when a good deal is on there it'll be gone quickly.   Also, don't go for the big time collectables. Mustangs, camaros, chevelles, anything Mopar. That stuff is going to be way too expensive.  Look for the things that are slightly less collectable.  Look out for full body fords, the galaxies fairlanes and torinos. 8,000 will get you a great ford, just not a classic mustang.   Novas have been a cheaper Chevy option but they're rising in price.

I knew of Nashes but when my wife said she wanted to name our son Nash I really became interested in them. I've had a '49 and now the '50 we have pages of old time magazine ads for Nash moco framed as wall art in his room. I've bought old service department patches for jackets to come some day.

classiccars,3bq7uq,fuelgun,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah GM's marketing (really all US auto marketing) liked to add European terms to their cars without much care about what they originally meant. And since the Corvair was meant to compete with the likes of VW and Porsche it really got this treatment in spades. That's why even though my Corvair says ""Corsa"" it is not a purpose-built track car and I really doubt that the Corvair Monza's had anything to do with the track in Italy.

I might start there to see if you can get what you think it's worth - it's low risk. Just make sure you represent the car accurately and go out of your way to point out any defects as your buyer will likely be buying it sight unseen. Or, I could give you $10K and we could call it a day :)"
classiccars,3bhdqr,alephnul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:13:14 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance - how does one go about shipping a car?
classiccars,3bhdqr,cmr252,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"There are a number of companies that specialize in shipping classics across the country. If you contacted a classic dealer like Fantasy Junction in California they would give you recommendations for ones they have had good experience with.   There will be a range of services and prices. You don't need the padded van and attendants with white cotton gloves that Peter Mullen uses to get his latest Bugatti from the shop where it is being finished to Pebble Beach, but you don't want Greasy John's cut rate car haul either."
classiccars,3bhdqr,tweist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, good reply below. There are many companies out there that ship classics, and typically you're buying space on a truck that's shipping a number of other cars as well. Prices range depending on service and milage, but usually around $400 - $800 in my experience. If you go the ebay route, just make sure you specify that the buyer is responsible for shipping. The shipping company will do an inspection on the car when they pick it up so if any damage occurs during the process it isn't your issue. Good luck!"
classiccars,3bhdqr,alephnul,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"First, get the paperwork / details in order... make sure he has the PHS documents (http://www.phs-online.com/) this will show the original build information including that its a true GTO, color combo, engine, etc.   1.. is it a automatic or manual :)  and what engine is in her? please say its an original tri-power... *edit... tripower ended in 66 my bad :( the VIN will tell you a lot of these details.  DETAILS are what will make the car valuable. Automatic / His Hers shifter (looks like this http://www.goodnotions.com/the_garage/gto/images/gto_shifter.jpg)? disc breaks? power steering? air conditioning?   Also, confirm what is original (or whats not)... specifically Engine Block, heads, manifolds (intake and exhaust), carburetor,  transmission, rear end... you need to know whats been done to the engine. Has it been rebuilt... does it run on pump gas or have the heads been changed out for lower octane.   After you get all those details and some really good pictures, then look for websites to post on. Ebay will work but if the car has some rare options a big classic car auction might be worthwile. Feel free to message me directly if you want any specific advise or examples of good GTO ads to mimic."

classiccars,3bhdqr,pettercottonmouth,3,Mon Jun 29 06:09:42 2015 UTC,"No idea where to sell or how much, but that looks good enough to sell itself. Have a look through eBay/Craigslist and get an idea of prices for similar age/condition cars. Price it slightly higher than you are willing to accept for it so you have a bit of barter room. If you can get some good photos and be honest about any negative points it will sell no trouble."

classiccars,3bhdqr,irishjihad,2,Mon Jun 29 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"Craigslist ads are only visible in a geographically limited market, and there is no auction process. Fine if you are selling a 4 or 5 year old used car. People buying a used Subaru don't want to pay an additional $1000 to get it across the country to them when they can just buy one locally. This car is highly desirable, but the market for it is dispersed across the US. People who are looking for one know full well that they will have to ship it home.  And the auction angle, You could pick a number and sell the car for it private treaty, but if you have a dozen people who all want it, chances are that that price can be nudged up a little, and sometimes a lot. It doesn't hurt if those people all have a drink in their hand, which is why Scottsdale is a good idea."
classiccars,3bhdqr,alephnul,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:12 2015 UTC,Makes sense I love Craigslist haha. I've bought most of my vehicles from it especially the classics. Although mine aren't auction quality or even show quality.
classiccars,3bhdqr,alephnul,2,Mon Jun 29 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"/u/alephul hit the nail on the head.  Your pool of buyers is smaller because of the geographical limitations of craigslist.  Sure, astute buyers search multiple areas, but you're better off with the sites I listed to hit the largest numbers of potential buyers.  Or he could just sell the car to me for $3,000 and we can end the discussion right now. :)"

classiccars,3banw2,frenchtom30,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:18:11 2015 UTC,Well it depends. The owner may have bought OG or aftermarket American spec bumpers. Looking at them though I think you are right that they do belong in an older beetle 68-72. The taillights are a dead giveaway for the mid-70s.   On thing to note is that the bumpers do not have the shock absorbers found on '74 and forward models. Then again that could have been something added for American specifications.

When I showed that car to most of my friends, they say ""why didn't you get a bellaire or something?""  And most of the people I have talked to about 20's and 30's cars are in their 80's.  I'm just over 1/3 of that age, and I LOVE these things.    It's incredible to me that this machine has existed - unaltered - for 85 years and still runs.  It's incredible that it lived through the Great Depression....a time when people threw bricks at Cadillacs and other expensive cars because it was seen as uhgely offensive to drive something so pricey when everyone was so poor.  And it lived through WWII, when metal was so scarce.  And every other human event in the last 85 years!  If only I knew what this car has seen.  I'm very interested in mechanical history, and this is a machine that has survived longer than most people, and still runs like it's new.  It's a piece of history.  Sadly, in the next 5 years, we are going to see a HUGE amount of knowledge about these cars die off with their elderly owners.  There just aren't that many people in their 40's+ that care about this vintage of automobiles, when you could have a tire smoke bleching neon camaro for similar money.  I'm flying up to Vermont next week to interview the owner of the Reo to learn as much about the car as I can.

In the country that means the really good cars are going overseas, leaving us with only the more mundane cars or they are being hot rodded.  We are losing our history rapidly.     I want to make sure that when my kids ask me about it in 40 years, I can give them a glimpse into the 1930's by just opening the garage door   Its a pity I live so far from you, I think you would love out garage :)    with three vintage cars and parts everywhere.  If you ever make it over to Australia, drop me a line, it always good to meet other younger Vintage car drivers (I'm mid 40s)"

classiccars,3au5ce,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Tue Jun 23 22:25:33 2015 UTC,I'll buy those off ya for 14k
classiccars,3au5ce,BattleStag17,4,Tue Jun 23 20:38:04 2015 UTC,each?  otherwise no thank you.. :-P
classiccars,3au5ce,crazyhomie34,2,Tue Jun 23 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"That is the face of a happy man. Enjoy them, mate. :)"
classiccars,3au5ce,masterevan,2,Tue Jun 23 22:07:54 2015 UTC,"I am insanely jealous of you, OP. That Oldsmobile is so beautiful, and the Buick is worth cherishing simply because it's such a piece of history. Way to go!"
classiccars,3au5ce,grahampaige,2,Tue Jun 23 22:27:44 2015 UTC,good job man! glad you saw the value in those cars
classiccars,3au5ce,hardisonthefloor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:30:52 2015 UTC,Great!  Now take care of tehm!  I would hate to see either one of them altered drastically given their condition.  Restomods and hot rods are great for cars that need work.  But those two look amazing as is.
classiccars,3au5ce,MazeppaPZ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:45:14 2015 UTC,so much this
classiccars,3au5ce,eXX0n,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"I was just wondering today if you pulled the trigger on this deal. I'm glad you did. One of my good friends has the exact same model and year Olds, even with the factory AC. Such a beautiful car."
classiccars,3awy1z,TypoKnig,2,Wed Jun 24 04:09:14 2015 UTC,Sweet.

classiccars,3as58i,arbili,8,Tue Jun 23 01:57:11 2015 UTC,This is the car that made me fall in love with Ferrari's. I have a family friend who inherited one from his dad.  All I have a few dozen Ferrari Hot Wheels.  One day...
classiccars,3as58i,tdub2112,2,Tue Jun 23 05:05:40 2015 UTC,"Same for me. Absolutely adore ferraris. And if you look at the 458 italia and this, you can see that they've kept some of the design features. Ageless design!"
classiccars,3as58i,60sLife,2,Tue Jun 23 08:14:07 2015 UTC,Nice shot.
classiccars,3as58i,alephnul,2,Tue Jun 23 02:30:04 2015 UTC,What year is that.  Looks perfect
classiccars,3as58i,hockeyguy013,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"The double low mirrors make it a post-87, and the five lug wheels make it post-89. So somewhere between 89 and 96. That's about as close as one can get based on a photo. It's a US market car based on the turn signal location."
classiccars,3as58i,AustinMiniMan,-2,Wed Jun 24 11:50:19 2015 UTC,Naw its just a fiero.
classiccars,3aqack,BuilderWho,2,Mon Jun 22 17:10:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the album ! The red Lotus is a XI and the white Audi is a Sport Quattro.
classiccars,3aqack,frenchtom30,2,Mon Jun 22 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Also that other white ""audi"" is an auto Union, of which Audi was a part of, but this is a dkw, not an Audi"
classiccars,3aqack,Crappedinplanet,2,Mon Jun 22 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"Ooooh. I was confused about that because I read somewhere that dkw was a different brand. Yet the car clearly has the four rings, so I assumed it was an Audi. Thanks for clearing that up."
classiccars,3aqack,Crappedinplanet,2,Mon Jun 22 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"The four rings interestingly enough represent the 4 companies that were part of auto Union. VW acquired nsu and auto Union in the late 60s, which they merged together to make Audi as we know it today"

classiccars,3amx3m,motown_missile,3,Sun Jun 21 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely a 61."
classiccars,3amx3m,mariohhh_dude,2,Sun Jun 21 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"My Grandpa had a '62...great car, lots of good memories of it (and him)!"
classiccars,3amx3m,motown_missile,2,Mon Jun 22 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"Coupe de ville if I remember the episode of Mad Men I watched last night, only difference between that and the '62 I can see is there was no partition between the front and rear windows in the 61. Beautiful."
classiccars,3amx3m,Blayblee,-8,Mon Jun 22 18:54:46 2015 UTC,69 And thanks
classiccars,3amx3m,motown_missile,5,Sun Jun 21 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, and I'm sure that's older than 1969...no later than 1963, at any rate."

classiccars,3amx3m,Pantybrittle,2,Mon Jun 22 03:04:39 2015 UTC,it really is incredibly sharp looking.
classiccars,3amx3m,TheGIddinge,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:07:30 2015 UTC,could be a 1960 also would need to see the back. 60 taillights were straight up and 61 there sideways like most cars.
classiccars,3antct,lopix,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:05:56 2015 UTC,It is my utmost dream to own of those. I think it'll be my midlife crisis purchase.
classiccars,3ajvxh,Rk1987,34,Sat Jun 20 22:31:56 2015 UTC,Yes
classiccars,3ajvxh,Dinahmoe,27,Sat Jun 20 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Assuming that those are recent pictures, and assuming that they are both relatively complete and unmodified, I would give you 13k for either one of them. If the Buick is as nice as it looks in the picture, it is probably worth more like 25 - 30 K."
classiccars,3ajvxh,alephnul,13,Sat Jun 20 23:43:06 2015 UTC,Yea I just took the pictures.. They run great could use a little work but what classic car couldn't.. They are straight looking solid cars.. The guy is not doing so great and he has other people interested but is willing to deal with me cause my father is one of his best friends. I just got to deal quick! Thanks for your response!
classiccars,3ajvxh,Pr4370r1u5,9,Sat Jun 20 23:52:43 2015 UTC,This guy is spot on. This is a fire-sale price.
classiccars,3ajvxh,thodelife,13,Sun Jun 21 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"Hey Reddit, I'm sorry if this is the incorrect location to post this but I'm under a lot of pressure because the person that is selling these cars is not doing well and just wants to get rid of them.  My dad is a good friend of the guy and he is willing to give me a 1953 Oldsmobile four-door with air conditioning all original. And that oher car is a 1929 Buick four-door sedan"
classiccars,3ajvxh,CovingtonLane,2,Sat Jun 20 22:34:10 2015 UTC,Both of them look like they need relatively minimal work to get them back into great condition. They seriously look like they just need new paint.  My god I would love that olds though.
classiccars,3ajvxh,thodelife,-4,Sun Jun 21 13:46:09 2015 UTC,New paint won't make it run any better.
classiccars,3ajvxh,ndpugs,3,Sun Jun 21 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed, however he never stated how well it runs so I could only base off of aesthetics."
classiccars,3ajvxh,grahampaige,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:55:30 2015 UTC,I will give you money for either one if you only want to keep one.
classiccars,3ajvxh,alephnul,5,Sun Jun 21 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"I am in a different market to you, but here in Australia I just paid about AUD 14K for a 1928 Graham Paige that hadn't moved in 12 years.  So that 29 Buick should be worth USD 13K all day every day"
classiccars,3ajvxh,grahampaige,3,Sun Jun 21 04:19:06 2015 UTC,"Hell, it sounds to me like you got a lightning deal on the Graham Paige. I hope that it turns out well for you."
classiccars,3ajvxh,alephnul,2,Mon Jun 22 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"I did get a good deal, probably because I knew the owner, but I also had the parts it needed to bring it back to what it should have been, and the owner knew it was going to a good home.  Even so Vintage prices are depressed at the moment due to the economy and people not confident in driving Vintage cars.  It took me about 9 months to get her on the road, but even ended up pushing her into daily service for a short time."

classiccars,3ajvxh,wanktarded,3,Sun Jun 21 05:54:56 2015 UTC,The Olds alone is easily worth it.
classiccars,3ajvxh,ZombieLinux,2,Sun Jun 21 12:44:55 2015 UTC,Buy them.
classiccars,3ajvxh,supercruiser,2,Sun Jun 21 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"Wowsa, yes!"
classiccars,3ajvxh,kuppajava,2,Sun Jun 21 12:54:00 2015 UTC,DO IT. NAO
classiccars,3ajvxh,crazyhomie34,2,Sun Jun 21 16:49:48 2015 UTC,Any more of those cars in the background up for sale?
classiccars,3ajvxh,TheSteelGinger,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"Good gawd man, YES!  I would almost feel bad for paying the man that little for each, much less for both of them."
classiccars,3ajvxh,linlorienelen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yes definitely, people spend just about 13k if not more to get it to presentable running condition on top of the price they paid for the car.  If I had the extra cash I would definitely buy them, worst case scenario you can easily make your money back."
classiccars,3ajvxh,whateverdipshit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:36:05 2015 UTC,What's wrong with them is the first thing that pops into my head because I don't see why someone would be selling those cars for that cheap that Buick alone is worth double ?
