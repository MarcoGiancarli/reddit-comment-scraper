Frozen,3e1vqq,sirius201,5,Tue Jul 21 09:02:32 2015 UTC,"Moving out undercover to get away from the drudges of court life, the two visit the Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna dressed in their casual clothes. After exploring the various items, Anna finds a necklace which looks almost identical to a necklace worn by Iduna, their mother.   She tries to buy it from Oaken, but learns that the merchant is unwilling to sell the item, because it is meant for a ""special customer"". Anna offers a large amount of money, but Oaken is sad to have to refuse.  Continuing their shopping, Anna comes up with a plan to steal the necklace. Elsa tells her she can't do that, but Anna impulsively continues anyway, trying to be ""inconspicuous"" which makes her look all the more suspicious.   Forced to act so her sister isn't caught, Elsa attempts to create a distraction by asking about the sauna, at which point Oaken and his family enthusiastically invite her in, stripping her out of her clothes and leaving her among the lot of them wearing nothing but a large blush of deep embarrassment.  While Anna escapes with the necklace, Elsa tries to hold out against the heat of the sauna, but after ten seconds or so, the snow queen can't take it anymore and is forced to flee from the heat, which ends up with her racing out into the store where everyone of course looks at her, causing her to flee outside where she finds Anna, who thinks the entire thing is hilarious, especially the embarrassed look on her sisters face.  Hugging her sister to help her calm down, Anna finally manages to get Elsa to come back to her senses, and the Queen of Arendelle quickly creates a snow gown, like she did in the ice palace.  At that point, Oaken -having put on something himself after the sauna visit- comes out with Elsa's corset and gown to return them to what he thinks is the poor girl all naked outside. He is shocked to see the Queen is there and quickly bows, apologizing and saying he was looking to return the clothes to a naked girl (not realizing that girl was actually Elsa), and invites the queen inside.  He explains that he met a trader who had a necklace which belonged to her mother and that he would like to give it to her, but is embarrassed to find that it has since been stolen. Anna - still in disguise - admits to the theft and reveals the necklace, offering it to Elsa with the explanation that ""she did not know"".  Elsa gives a stern look to disguised Anna and pays Oaken twice the amount Anna offered for the necklace earlier as a finders fee. As queen, she additionally orders that the still disguised Anna - as punishment for her theft - goes out to find the naked girl and return her clothes to her, which the red-haired princess promptly receives from the merchant.  One embarrassing memory richer, Elsa returns to the castle, and Anna, carrying her sisters clothes, follows not much later after pretending to wanders the forest around the Trading Post and Sauna. The next morning, Gerda wonders what Queen Elsa's dress and underwear are doing in Anna's room."

The guards name was kristoff. The guard was easily tricked because he only has a dog named sven as company. Anna felt sorry for him so Anna spends some time with him.
Frozen,3e1vqq,dragongt1994,3,Tue Jul 21 09:27:34 2015 UTC,"On that note, I'd say make some jewelry or a dress.  Elsa would probably get caught due to guilt, I can imagine Anna would be more relaxed on the whole matter."

They would probably steal food or some novelty toys. Elsa might be able to use her magic to help her, like to disguse the thing, hide it, or just deactivate any device or destroy any form of ancient alarm. Elsa gets away freely. Anna on the other hand is more clumsy and rushes more, in the end she might get caught for not being able to properly hide her booty. Kristoff must go to bail her."

The tweet got deleted, naturally, because it reveals a production detail.  Now granted, it's not a verified Twitter account, but nothing about it appears faked. It's probably true that she was in to do some voice work. And of course with the movie not scheduled to go out until 2018 at the earliest, there's plenty of time for anything that happens now to get cut from the final product."

Frozen,3e1ahx,Demian_Dillers,3,Tue Jul 21 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much this. It would've been really weird that such info was released now too."
Frozen,3e1ahx,Luimnigh,3,Tue Jul 21 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"Besides, it is way too early in Frozen 2's development for any voice acting to happen. Right now, they'd be writing the first draft of the story and designing the storyboards."

I think the tweet taken by itself doesn't necessarily confirm anything, but the fact that it was deleted does make it seem as if it may have been an unapproved leak."
Frozen,3e1ahx,Theroonco,4,Tue Jul 21 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"If this is true, then it's really awesome that Disney already has a plan and is hard at work! And I love that we already have a slight tease of what's to come. I always thought we might have more flashbacks. As long as this doesn't undo/ retcon what we saw in Frozen, I look forward to seeing what may happen: more flashbacks with her parents? I want to say a hint of where her powers came from, but that feels like something that would have come up in Frozen, unless it was a hint she missed or never picked up on. It makes sense that an 8 (or 9, we only know she's voicing someone in that age range) year old Elsa would miss or not see a mysterious figure or strange ice formation (that she may blame on herself).  I'm going by the Google cache /u/scribe22557786 found by the way."

Also, Anna's main goal in the film was to save her own life by getting a kiss from (then-hero) Hans, which meant that 2013's most female-empowering movie was almost about how chicks need to get a man at all costs. Of course, this was all much closer in tone to the fairy tale that Frozen was based on, but if Disney always strived for accuracy, The Little Mermaid would have ended in a suicide and a boom in the child therapy industry.   Considering the Snow Queen is about a little girl called Gerda going to rescue her friend Kai, I don't think the writer of this article has ever read ""the fairy tale Frozen was based on."" :P"

Frozen,3dzk2p,scribe22557786,5,Mon Jul 20 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"A few points I would like to raise here.  The problem here is that we don't know how her powers grow over time. It could be consistent, arbitrary, or even exponential. Frozen Fever didn't really show much in regards to the evolution of her powers. In fact, it seems to have slowed down. Regarding her ""overpoweredness"" though, she is far from overpowered. Her mentality alone compensates for that rather well, and that alone can work as an excellent plot device for a future installment. Yeah, she possesses the power, but learning how to use it is the challenge that her character is striving to overcome. She doesn't need to replicate that feat where she froze Arendelle again. They can just say it was single circumstance, a testament to her true potential, but have her never display such a feat again. IMO, she should never fully understand and control her powers, as they are one of the motives that her character needs to strive for that directly develops her character as well.  Honestly, I don't think we need to worry about that. That was never the central theme of the film anyways."
Frozen,3dzk2p,XNinja2017,4,Mon Jul 20 22:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she possesses the power, but learning how to use it is the challenge that her character is striving to overcome.   The ending of Frozen heavily implies that control isn't a problem anymore, give or take some snowgies. Fever shows Elsa being so confident in the use of the powers that she uses them on Anna right after she puts the dress on. Think about how big a step that is, to have her magic go swirling around her sister like that. That's well beyond just creating some skates. It's pretty clear that an Elsa who isn't ill is supposed to be in full control of the powers.  It's like what I said in the OP: having Elsa not be able to control the powers again would undercut the conclusion of the first move."
Frozen,3dzk2p,vetahi,3,Tue Jul 21 06:32:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe she still doesn't understand her powers fully, but don't the scene in let it go and later her defense against the duke's 2 men show that she knows how to control it pretty well? She can defend with and move ice, create living snow creatures, and build an ice castle for herself on demand"
Frozen,3dzk2p,XNinja2017,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:30 2015 UTC,"You're right. I have addressed this matter on other threads before, but I am exhausted right now to provide a full comprehensive response. Just making it quick here. The premise of this idea was that she displays considerably better control when she isn't faced with these two variables: Ensuring the security and welfare of Anna, and the concealment of her powers. These only apply to film Elsa however, and post-Frozen Elsa likely isn't bound to these anymore. In fact, the former could serve as an incentive to further persue her true potential rather than impede her abilities like before."
Frozen,3dzk2p,Demian_Dillers,4,Tue Jul 21 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"She didn't realize at first that the second Olaf was alive, and when she learns it, she stares in wonder at her hands.   An interesting part about this is that minutes after finding out, she actually creates an even more impressive snowman, more complex and with more energy.   Regarding to her powers on her context, I never really saw the problem with overpoweredness most see. In the end there can always be plot devices to keep her in check like the urn in OUAT or wa more impressive things.  In any case seems her creativity is the limit. Would be interesting to see the use of her powers in all kinds of situations, from simple things like crating ice-cream such as the Dairy Queen did in OUAT, to actual fighting and who knows exploring the healing displays she showed at the end of the movie.   The one thing I'd hope is that she doesn't get equivalent ""fire powers"" to balance too, or other elements, would feel cheap and stupid.   Hey powers being out of control for any reason seems also silly and dumb, it worked in fever because it was mostly comedic, but being the problematic again would be not only repetitive but limiting.   That being said, speaking of control I think Elsa needs to control her powers in fear too. While others consider that a necessary weakness, it's not like there can't be other magic stuff on that world to challenge Elsa, it's all about introducing new elements to an unexplored universe. Elsa putting fear as a bad emotion all times and losing control is bad ""fear is the enemy"" sure, but fear is also natural and all out emotions are important, if Elsa could not rely on love all the time and ultimately do what the Elsa in OUAT did when she helped Emma, IMO would be pretty awesome, and go beyond and control her powers when she's actually struck in total fear would be the best development she could have, finally facing the monster , but not only defeating it with love, but dominating it because it's part of her."
Frozen,3dzk2p,Demian_Dillers,4,Mon Jul 20 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"An interesting part about this is that minutes after finding out, she actually creates an even more impressive snowman, more complex and with more energy.   And yet, that snowman is still pretty blobby and looks more like those childish snow piles than the refined structure of the stairway and ice palace. What Elsa does from her positive feelings in ""Let It Go"" are far greater than what she does from fear, whether it be shooting an unfocused blast of magic at the end of the reprise or creating the malformed Marshmallow. Once again, love is greater than fear.  The problem with Elsa being overpowered is that it eliminates the filmmakers' ability to make the plot of the second movie a problem that the powers can solve. In contrast, there are problems in the Harry Potter stories that must be solved by magic, but the main heroes are constrained by either a lack of knowledge or skill in magic, which in turn allows for drama and tension. It's basically established now that Elsa can skillfully just do whatever she wants with her powers, so Frozen 2 can't really play on that dynamic. If it's obvious the solution to the movie is Elsa using her magic, then we'll just be marking time until she unleashes her deus ex machina.  I thought the urn in OUaT was pretty cheap, especially because Elsa could have solved the problems leading up to the urn coming into play with her magic. She could have used her powers to block the invaders with an ice wall or snowman army or something. Besides, it's also established that the trolls are the only beings in that universe with any knowledge of magic. The villains in the sequel could be trolls who aren't Kristoff's family—that's what I did when I wrote my attempt at a WDAS-style sequel—but really the conflict has to be something that magic can't solve—something I also did in that story.  If in the sequel Elsa succumbs to fear or can't control the powers again or something, it would undercut the message and the events of first movie. They just can't do that. But Elsa is also so powerful that there's not a way to put up a conflict that her powers must solve without things getting too ridiculous. If Elsa wasn't so powerful, they'd have more storytelling options. Instead, they have to really thread the needle to have an equally compelling story as in the first one."
Frozen,3dzk2p,HeimrArnadalr,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"And yet, that snowman is still pretty blobby and looks more like those childish snow piles than the refined structure of the stairway and ice palace. What Elsa does from her positive feelings in ""Let It Go"" are far greater than what she does from fear, whether it be shooting an unfocused blast of magic at the end of the reprise or creating the malformed Marshmallow. Once again, love is greater than fear.   Mmm I think it was more the case that Elsa wanted something weird then, she didn't gave it much thought.  In any case I fully disagree with Elsa's powers being too great thus being problematic.  There's actually never any confirmation that trolls were the only ones who knew magic on the movie. And while I do agree on the urn being cheap, it's also just a quick example that you can always create more stuff.  Elsa is not as overpowered as people think. She's still pretty human, she's not overly fast or strong, and she certainly can't fly or resist bullets. There are beings that are just so much more powerful and yet get constant challenges in many ways and not just for random weaknesses like kryptonite.   Creating problems for Elsa is not that hard. Hell just imagine in OUAT, if Elsa had to face someone like Rumplestiltskin she'd be fucked. I consider thinking they are truly too powerful is a limitation. In the end there can always be old sorcerers, diseases, outwardly beings etc. that Elsa can fight and as you said perhaps deal with them not with magic but in other ways.   There's a lot of challenges Elsa could face, just as any other superpowered character (not necessarily a super hero) has had to do in great ways, and that just depends on creativity, something I'm sure the Disney team doesn't lack."
Frozen,3dzk2p,vetahi,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"Elsa is like Superman. Her powers can solve most problems easily, but in doing so they create a huge mess. What's the point in summoning a huge storm or an army of giant snow golems to destroy her enemies if Arendelle is destroyed too?   Political intrigue is another option: some enemies can't be wiped off the face of the earth with magic. Someone with the shield of diplomatic immunity or the guile to operate behind the scenes will be a problem that can't be solved with the direct application of a blizzard."
Frozen,3dzk2p,vetahi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is an aspect that I didn't think of yet is kinda obvious. Sure her powers can solve lots of problems, especially now that she's become older and more experienced with them, but using them would be messy. There's no real convenient way for her to reverse what she does."

Let's be honest we barely saw a glimpse of what Elsa did or how much she controlled her powers, by her parents words that was not the first accident, just the most problematic one. We see that the King and Queen tried to help her control it, but letting Anna or other people around and spread fear was just problematic. The decision seemed fairly natural. We can't truly pretend we would know how to raise other people's kids better when we know so little of their situation.  In any case, you expect an answer, so, let's just say I'll go to a cliff, drop Elsa and let gravity do it's work.(Not serious, obviously)"

Frozen,3dwend,trollface_bot,3,Mon Jul 20 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"Just a more serious note pertaining to the subject at hand, they weren't neccessarily wrong. Their decision was more of a act of desperation. They didn't help her control it in the sense that many of us are proposing here. They taught her how to control it by concealing it and hoping it goes away. When you actually encourage her to use her powers and understand them rather then disregarding them and fearing them you will get a whole different outcome. That's the approach that I would take. She never learned to embrace her powers, and that's all she needs. The motivation and encouragement to not fear them and conceal them. Having her maintain contact with Anna would help too. Yeah, she would be frightened at first, but that's natural. She would have overcome it eventually."
Frozen,3dwend,XNinja2017,4,Mon Jul 20 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"They taught her how to control it by concealing it   Even if true, this is a semantic distinction, since concealing her powers requires the ability to control them.   and hoping it goes away.   I don't think there's any evidence for this, especially since the trolls said her powers would only get stronger.   When you actually encourage her to use her powers and understand them rather then disregarding them and fearing them you will get a whole different outcome.    They might get a different outcome, but we can't expect anyone in the film to know that it would have been a better outcome. We know in hindsight (and from a narrative perspective) that it may have been better, but the parents don't have the luxury of hindsight or narrative awareness.   She never learned to embrace her powers, and that's all she needs.   Based on the events of the movie, embracing her powers wasn't all she needed. If that were the case, then her character arc would have ended at LIG. Given how wildly dangerous and destructive her powers are, she should learn to control them before embracing them, and in the movie, Elsa doesn't embrace them until she learns to control them.   Having her maintain contact with Anna would help too.   Depends on what kind of contact it is. Elsa almost killed Anna with her powers by accident. It's easy to say that the parents shouldn't have separated them (though it's unclear how much of that separation was the parents' decision and how much of it was Elsa's fear), but if Elsa had accidentally struck and killed Anna during the DYWTBAS years, then we'd all be questioning the parents' decision to allow their daughters to be near each other given their knowledge of how dangerous and volatile Elsa's powers are.   She would have overcome it eventually.   Unless she accidentally kills Anna. Then that would just reinforce her fear of her powers.  Edit: SGPFC"

Frozen,3dw92u,PanPizz,4,Mon Jul 20 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"We have gone through these a lot of times here except three. Let me reiterate...   Yes, it's possible that she may change, however, that's entirely dependent on how much time has elapsed since the first film. We know it will be more than a year because Frozen Fever already took place a year after. Regardless, her independence is what rose her to popularity among the audience, and a love interest could prove detrimental to that. I think Disney has acknowledged that by now, and they will likely avoid making that mistake. No. Plain and simple. That could deviate from actual character development to something completely redundant that would require extra work to accomplish what exactly? If anything, a baby will hurt the franchise more than help it. It will serve as an intrusion and nothing more. Is this for us to satisfy your inflation ""thing"" again? No offense man, but it's starting to get a little ""unsettling"" that you bring this up every single time. Again, what purpose does this serve? Although for a short it's acceptable as a joke.   In essence, these are terrible ideas, and we have addressed them here on the sub numerous times."
Frozen,3dw92u,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jul 20 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you in the least, though I would like to add if Snow Queen Elsa were to be given a romantic interest in Frozen II, he would be Prince Hans the romance would only be hinted towards & the finale would leave the relationship open-ended on the relationship status."
Frozen,3dw92u,AnonnyMiss,3,Mon Jul 20 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, don't worry. I actually think Helsa could work. Not going to go into detail, but it's far from impossible. In fact, I could work if Disney plays their cards right. I would actually like if the Frozen franchise became a trilogy and had Elsa find someone at the end of the trilogy. I have actually had a similar idea to your's before."
Frozen,3dw92u,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:10 2015 UTC,"1.) I think they didn't give Elsa a love interest (nor will they probably give her one any time soon) to show that women can be independent and don't need a man in their life to 'help' them.  2.) This is most likely going to happen in Frozen 2. I think its also been implied or mentioned / reccomended in the movie and on here.  3.) Who knows, you might be right. She did spend a long time in that giant ice castle she made without any food though."
Frozen,3dw92u,jayjay200,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"What if [one of the] message[s] of the sequel is that while Snow Queen Elsa is by far independent & self-reliant, her romantic interest needs her."
Frozen,3dw92u,AnonnyMiss,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"3 is intriguing,  her powers may have her consume more energy and would require her to eat more food."

Frozen,3dw92u,TheHappyJammer,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:07 2015 UTC,To do a Frozen conspiracy about those two other Tumblr accounts that post Frozen related content. You know what I am talking about!
Frozen,3dw92u,AnonnyMiss,3,Mon Jul 20 11:28:36 2015 UTC,Snow Queen Elsa did not have a romantic interest in the first film because her life was too complicated enough already. She was too consumed internally in Frozen & her heart was closed off. It is impossible for one to love another if he or she does not love oneself. Not going to happen- Kristoff Bjorgman & Princess Anna are not even married! Really?
Frozen,3dw92u,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jul 20 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"Really?   Trust me, I know the real reason why. You don't want to know. See my comment."

Frozen,3dw92u,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:32 2015 UTC,"Nah, over at /r/ElsaMasterRace he keeps suggesting Elsa finger quote ""inflating"" for no reason really.

Frozen,3dw92u,paspartuu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:42 2015 UTC,"But think, all those people complaining about body positivity and how narrow-minded it is from Disney to only show thin, conventionally pretty princesses, and how harmful that is to young girls growing up thinking that only waif-thin women are beautiful - wouldn't it be just so incredibly progressive to have Elsa struggle with her weight, get near-obese as a result of her love of chocolate, and still be gorgeous and kick-ass? A bold step forward! ."
Frozen,3dw92u,ArendelleKnight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's pretty unlikely actually. I think this one is only slightly more likely than the first, and personally I hope we don't have a time jump that big.  If we do see Anna and Kristoff's kid at some point I'd worry about the focus shifting to them as in several Disney Toon Studios sequels. What in the literal fuck?"
Frozen,3dw92u,paspartuu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think that eventually, Elsa will get a love interest. . Probably not in Frozen 2, though, but I'm assuming they'll at least touch on the subject of her feeling romantic interest. There might be some long looks or something like that - if they actually slap on a full-blown Disney romance for her, I'll be somewhat shocked.   Elsa spent the largest part of the 1st movie being terrified of accidentally killing anyone near her, so it's not a surprise she didn't have time to think about romance. But in the sequel, she's no longer afraid, and has time to think about other things. And while a large part of the audience loves her for her independence, a very large part wants to see her find someone, as well. Being independent doesn't mean ""alone forever"", after all. So she could start to take her first hesitant steps towards a romance.  On Kristanna - I'm fairly sure we'll see an official engagement, and possibly even a wedding, but a baby might be too soon. Already in Frozen Fever several months (almost a year) had passed, so it's possible that Frozen 2 will take place two or even three years after Frozen, or a year and a half in the least. It's enough time for an engagement to not be hasty, so it wouldn't be rushed. But the audience still needs to see them interact in different stages of the relationship, and fast-forwarding to having a baby in the span of 1 movie might be too much.  I really wish we'll see the sisters deal with the realities of ruling, and overcoming past trauma. It being Disney means that the likelihood of seeing realistic political problems in the film are very, very low, I know, but I can hope. I just want to see Elsa perform some sort of royal duties ;_;  And of course, I hope to see Hans. I'm really wishing for any hints of a Helsa romance but know that it's very unlikely to happen, alas - but my realistic hope is to see more of Hans and the Southern Isles. I don't care how, I just want to gaze upon him in all his snarky, treacherous, freckled glory. (As long as he doesn't die.)"

Frozen,3du2gh,9kz7,9,Sun Jul 19 13:54:37 2015 UTC,I agree. There's a reason why so many people love Reprise.

Frozen,3du2gh,Sylra,8,Mon Jul 20 13:36:15 2015 UTC,the reprise was one of the best parts in the movie..
Frozen,3du2gh,dragongt1994,3,Sun Jul 19 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"I actually wished they had more standalone songs without one meddling with the other's song :P. I think a significant duet (such as reprise, which is one of the best songs) is fine but I don't want much more music than what we got for the next movie."
Frozen,3du2gh,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm a little alone here...I love Life's Too Short (and the reprise of it), but...the reprise of For the First Time in Forever is my least favorite song in the entire movie next to Fixer Upper (which I end up disliking even more for other reasons I've mentioned in the past that aren't directly related to the song itself). Anna's part in it is just fine, but Elsa's has just never jived with me. It may have something to do with Anna starting the song out and Elsa's vocal style reaaally clashing something fierce (IMO) with Anna's: not sure. I'd have to listen to their parts in a vacuum to know for sure... All I know is that by the time Elsa is about to start singing her lines, I'm unfortunately about ready to skip to them running away from Marshmellow. I wish I liked that sequence more, but I just don't. :/"
Frozen,3du2gh,BartyMae,2,Sun Jul 19 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Life's too short was pretty good, and I think it kind of fit with the canon, if not for their personalities, for their situations. In any case I prefer songs that don't seem awkward in a less ""musical"" setting, like let it go that Elsa sings absolutely to herself because she wanted that strength and she's ecstatic, so okay, that works, then RABTP too because he is a mountaineer singing to his pet. But  others seem just weird. That being said, reprise seems to work for the interaction between the sisters and I like how clashing it is, how one is completely oblivious and how one just feels something hard to explain. Personally I like Elsa's parts way more and I think the song starts being good when she starts singing, since before that seems kind of awkward too :P."
Frozen,3du2gh,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"Funny: I find the reprise of FtFTiF to be the most awkward of all the songs: Elsa delivers her first lines in a sort of half-singing, half-talking tone, and the instrumental itself doesn't really do her any favors in the scene (it feels so half-hearted) until after Anna tells her about Arendelle. Then, after Anna does tell Elsa, Elsa begins to deliver her lines in a totally weird tone of voice: ""I can't escape the CUUUURSE"", ""noescapefrom the storm insiiide""...I do like the ""you're not safe here"" line, though. :P I dunno: it's just hard for to sit through the entire thing for some reason. :("
Frozen,3du2gh,BartyMae,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:43 2015 UTC,"Haha oh well, I don't mean the song being awkward on it's composition itself not it's lyrics. I mean song being awkward on the setting, like ""why the fuck are they singing at that moment?"" I guess the most awkward on that sense is FTFTIF or In Summer, Reprise doesn't seem so bad since you can say it's a way for approaching Anna uses and Elsa just responds. But yeah I can understand you not liking it, we all like different things. Personally I just hope they don't put much more music in Frozen 2, specially not music at the end. IMO having a music-less third act was the best."
Frozen,3du2gh,Demian_Dillers,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly musicless, but I know what you meant. :P Yeah, I did understand what you considered awkward, but I have other considerations as to what makes things awkward, so I explained my perspective, like you said, haha...  I never really realized there weren't any songs in the last third or so of Frozen: that seems...different than normal for Disney, I think? Interesting observation."
Frozen,3du2gh,BartyMae,2,Mon Jul 20 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"Oh I see haha, well, I understand why you would consider that awkward in any case, after all the songs themselves can be pretty weird too and that's kind of annoying.  Yeah it s a bit different than most musicals I think. Many have the villain song there or a song as resolution, but I don't think that would work for Frozen. The only time I've seen a great  ending song has been in Hercules because it was so significant to the story and sang by the muses, but I don't think that would work well in Frozen, or other movies for that matter."
Frozen,3du2gh,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:04:04 2015 UTC,"A resolution song isn't usually too terrible (...as long as it's not happening during the actual action, that is), but yeah, I don't normally really want to see a villain song. Though they can be quite a spectacle (see Anastasia), they usually don't add much in terms of actual meaningful content (since they're usually just the equivalent of your standard evil monologue...something I kind of wish Hans hadn't had when he rejected Anna. How cold and surreal would it have been if he had just ignored Anna, gone about extinguishing the lights, and then just...left while she sits there in confusion and terror while trying to talk to him? It'd be bewildering and terrifying to the audience, most of which weren't expecting it...just like the characters in the film. They'd probably have to spell it out at least a little to the audience in some other manner at some point, but that's okay. Maybe he'd flash her his best evil smile as he left or something, I don't know: I just think evil monologues are way overused and makes a character harder to believe.).  P.S. Sorry this reply took so long: have been pretty busy over the past 36 hours or so and didn't much have the energy to dedicate thought to my reply."

Frozen,3dtz34,ricANNArdo,5,Sun Jul 19 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"Olaf couldn't resist the temptation. The Snowgies, originating from the same source as Olaf, likely inherited the same traits and interests. The difference between the two though is that Snowgies only possess the most primal instincts. Much like how a baby kitten may react to a piece of yarn."
Frozen,3dtz34,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for comparing snowgies to Olaf... but another questions floats: Why Olaf, and by extension, the snowgies, like that cake? Note that they don't have taste buds and (sorry for Olaf fans) literal brains."
Frozen,3dtz34,XNinja2017,5,Sun Jul 19 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"Well, we do know this. Olaf, and likely all her constructs, all are manifestations infused with her memories or even the emotions that she is experiencing at the time. Elsa loves sweets as evidenced by her love of chocolate, and that cake falls under that category as the piece that Olaf bit off in Frozen Fever clearly showed that the interior of the cake was comprised of a chocolate flavor. These entities inherit the traits of their creator, and the love of chocolate and sweets is one of them.   In the case of the Snowgies, they are like toddlers. They are captivated by anything. They see interest in the world interacting with their environment as they seek to understand it. They operate on their own base instincts, and cake is something inherent to them that they can't neccessarily control the impulse. Regardless of possessing a neural system or not, it's inherent, and they can't do anything to suppress that temptation as toddler-like entities."
Frozen,3dtz34,XNinja2017,3,Sun Jul 19 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Elsa's love cakes, so Olaf, snowgies and her possible future living creatures she can create automatically loves cakes too.  So with that reasoning, it's Elsa's fault of why Kristoff do too much work on just a single instruction.  ...and I want to see an animation of Marshmallow eating a cake... Or he's excluded?"
Frozen,3dtz34,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. It isn't much different then the inheritance of genetic traits really. The difference though is unlike the arbitrary nature of biological traits, Elsa seems to possess some minor control over it.  Not really, her powers react drastically even to the most subtle changes in her. To tell the truth, she has fantastic control over them already. The Snowgies were conjured from a simple sneeze. A byproduct of a small discharge of energy. Then we see what happens when her powers go haywire after a mental breakdown...  We haven't seen enough of Marshmellow to say anything with certainty, but I think it's safe to assume that. And yeah, I just want more of those animations in general lol."
Frozen,3dtz34,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jul 19 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't know how their physiology work. Olaf can see and seems he can Smell, but he can't ""feel"", yet he might be able to taste, which would of course extend to other snowmen. As it's being mentioned, snowgies are basic life forms, so they follow instincts mostly, they just want to damn delicious thing there.  Given the cake is an ice-cream cake, seems to be the perfect food food for snow beings, so they all just desire to devour that."
Frozen,3dtz34,dragongt1994,2,Sun Jul 19 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"You got me intruiged there now. I don't think their physiology is anymore complex than ours. Aside from the absence of a few components, they aren't any different than us really. The lolmagic likely behaves as a substitute for those processes. They could be energy beings whose physical body is more of a proxy to interact with the world. Destroying the body they inhabit will probably do nothing to them explaining why Olaf nor Marshmellow expressed any signs of pain in the film. I have stated this before, but they along with Elsa's powers, remind me of the Flood from Halo. You could literally handwave her powers as the Neural Physics that the Precursors utilize.  I didn't even know it was an ice cream cake. Now that I think about it, does Olaf actually ever taste anything? I know he bites the cake, but I mean something like an explicit quote where he says something like ""Mmm it's tasty""."

Frozen,3dr06g,mpsantiago,10,Sat Jul 18 16:51:19 2015 UTC,Frozen and Inside Out together is the best of combinations. Hope constable keeps on doing more these.

Frozen,3dr9r5,BartyMae,4,Sat Jul 18 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"It's from the reprise, and I think that video does a good job of showing which lyrics are Elsa's and which are Anna's."

No.   This is post-Frozen, so you know what Hans did, would you still love him (or would you even try , to begin with)?   I didn't love him before, and I still wouldn't, unless by logical necessity I have to, in which case I wouldn't have a choice.   How much would you hate your life?

I say I have some kind of magic-induced illness and wish to be left alone for a few days to recover. At night, I sneak aboard a ship bound for the Duchy of Weselton and beg for the Duke's help, hinting that this might be a good way to get back in the Queen's good graces.  Should he refuse, I fall back to plan B: Arendelle. I send a message back to Hans, saying I've fled to hide amongst the fjords of Arendelle and that he's welcome to try and chase me down. In reality, I board a ship for Corona, and wait for news of Hans smashing his military against the Snow Queen's defenses."
Frozen,3dp29y,creepycherry,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:29:09 2015 UTC,Why would Hans want to chase you down?

Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,3,Fri Jul 17 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"Uh, except for the crushing loneliness she mentions in the song..."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,5,Fri Jul 17 16:51:01 2015 UTC,You can only really appreciate sadness when you've been happy before. When she was rejected by her sister during the first chorus was great.Anna experience innocent happiness to gutrenching sadness of the end. Anna trying to handle the death of her parents without her sister being there with no good reason. it would have been horrible. Elsa's was sad and all but it was repetitive.   Edit: Plus the loneliness that was not even explained to her
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,5,Fri Jul 17 17:03:46 2015 UTC,Anna had this gradual descent from happy to sadness which makes it more apparent when she hits low.   There was no forged bonds portrayed in the film. But If your gonna assume Anna had forged bonds why would you not expect Elsa to have at least some company? She was heir to the throne. Of course she was gonna need somebody to teach her or something.
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,9,Fri Jul 17 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"Somewhat relevant comment I wrote a long time ago.   I connected with Elsa's character pretty early in the film, so I doubt her sexuality had anything to do with it (at least I hope it didn't). I tend to sympathize with characters who have to make the hard choices, and during the snowman song, it was Elsa who was making all of the hard choices. Anna's situation sucked, but she was confused as to why things were happening the way they were. Elsa also suffered and was lonely, but she suffered the additional burden knowing why, and thus the additional responsibility of keeping her sister safe, which, as far as she knew, meant denying her sister's happiness.  What makes this even worse is that Elsa lives to see the people around her happy. In the snowballroom scene, we see that Elsa's thrills come not from playing with snow, but from seeing her sister happy. When Anna knocks on Elsa's door and asks her if she wants to build a snowman and play, the camera focuses entirely on Anna, but all I could think about was how hard this was for Elsa. She's an 8 year old girl who is charged with the responsibility of breaking her sister's heart, and she can't tell her why she's doing it, and she can't tell her how much she wishes she didn't have to. There's a reason why ""Go away, Anna"" is my flair, and this is one of them.  But it doesn't stop there. She has to keep doing this everyday, for years and years, hurting both her sister and herself by choosing to isolate herself not just physically, but mentally and emotionally as well. This causes her to become extremely dependent on her parents for mental and emotional support, especially her father, because they were the only ones who knew what she was going through, they were the only ones who could console her, and they were her only protection against the outside world who she feared would reject her and try to harm her if they found out about her powers. So when her parents died, I got pretty emotional, not because I liked her parents, but because I knew how much they meant to Elsa. Without her parents, she was now truly alone.  When Anna comes by after her parents' funeral, the camera again focuses entirely on Anna, but all I could think about was how hard this was for Elsa. Unable to attend her own parents' funeral, unable to explain why, and unable to be there for her sister, not because she's a selfish immature brat, but because she's doing what feels she has to do to protect her sister. When Anna says ""We only have each other"", I couldn't help but think about how hard that was for Elsa to hear through the door, because she doesn't have her sister, and she can't have her sister, and only she knows why. They're just inches apart from each other, but there may as well be an ocean between them.  Then the camera pans across the door and we see a girl who's so scared, so vulnerable, and in so much pain, and unable to reach out to anyone for help. She knows the only thing that can ease her suffering is sitting right outside her door, but it's also the one thing she won't allow herself to have. She's choosing to bear all of her pain alone, because she's too selfless not to. I'm not a touchy-feely kind of person, and in my entire life, I've never felt the desire to hug someone, until I saw her in that moment.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Frozen/comments/21561y/why_elsa_is_so_popular/cg9ynxe"
Frozen,3dmzrh,CarterDug,5,Fri Jul 17 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"You just put into words why I liked/cared so much about the parents (it's not necessarily so much things about them I like, but rather what they are to Anna and particularly Elsa, and what they might represent in our own lives), and probably why even though I'm sympathetic to Anna in that sequence (who is essentially facing mostly the same problem as Elsa, but in an entirely different tone and setting), it seems impossibly worse for Elsa. For such a seemingly simple basis for a song and sequence, it's terribly nuanced (terrible in the sense of what the nuance actually is, that is...). My favorite part of the movie, too..."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,3,Fri Jul 17 17:51:36 2015 UTC,I get Elsa's situations but her problem with me that she seems to not try all that much to alleviate her sisters pain that much. She could have easily talked to Anna during do you wanna build a snowman assuring her that he was there for her. She could have connected to her sister without even touching her.   Edit: For example Elsa could have tried to talk to Anna just right after do you wanna build a snowman. It was the right time for Elsa to say something at least.
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"It was the right time for Elsa to say something at least.   Elsa: ""Go away, Anna!""  Anna: ""Okay"" (cries)"
Frozen,3dmzrh,CarterDug,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Yeh Elsa was awful saying that, totally not necessary at all."
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised Elsa let her go on for 16 measures before saying that. I would have said it much sooner.  Anna: ""Do you wanna build a -""  Me: ""Shut Up, Anna!""  Edit: AC"
Frozen,3dmzrh,CarterDug,2,Sat Jul 18 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"It read to me like something she's been instructed to say. She's been moved to a different room in order to keep the sisters separate, because ""you remember what happened the last time you played with Anna, Elsa? That's right, you nearly killed her. So it's important that you stay away from Anna.""  They're supposed to be apart because the parents say so, and she's a good, obedient girl."
Frozen,3dmzrh,paspartuu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"So your saying the parents instructed that they would just rudely cast of her sister. Shouldn't the parents have said, 'This is the excuse we are going with' instead of hurting her like that. Anyways all of this are just assumptions probably formed by our predisposition to the characters.   This is not the last time Elsa keeps pushing her away rudely. The coronation party scene was another example. I don't why everybody keeps ignoring Elsa's wrong doings through out the film as if she was void of all responsibility of actions."
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"parents instructed that they would just rudely cast of her sister.   Yes, that's exactly what they did. You hear the King's voicover going ""We'll keep her powers hidden from everyone, including Anna"", and we see Elsa cast a sad look at Anna as she's closing the door. Clearly it's not her decision, and it's obvious her parents have told her to stay in her room and absolutely not play with Anna since the last time she did, Anna almost died, and there's a risk that Elsa's powers will burst out (as we see them doing many times during DYWTBAS) which might trigger some memory in Anna's meddled-with mind and how would that affect things.  Yes, it's a shitty decision, and yes, the parents should have handled the whole thing differently and sat Anna down and explained things better to her, but blaming 8-year-old Elsa for the separation, blaming her for being a good girl who does as she's told and honours the parent's wishes of them being kept apart for the sake of everybody's safety, is stupid imo.   And yes, she keeps it up into adulthood because that's the only way she's learned to deal with the situation. She's convinced she's a danger to everyone. The last time she had fun with her sister she almost killed her. ""I'm just trying to protect you"", remember?  And what do you mean with the coronation party scene? The scene where Anna very rudely ignores the Queen's orders and wishes and raises a scene at the coronation ball?"
Frozen,3dmzrh,paspartuu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:54:02 2015 UTC,"We'll keep her powers hidden from everyone, including Anna your stretching the meaning of this phrase too much. It could have mean just don't tell Anna. That's it. All the rest of your interpretation seem to just put Elsa into an idealistic position of being not responsible to anything. For those three years she could just have talked to the girl without hurting her by I don't know letters, shouting, SOMETHING? they're could a number of ways for Anna to communication but seems to be content to keep status quo. I know that the parents carry most of the blame but people shouldn't always blame the parents. Some brats are brats because of their parents, that doesn't mean the brat have total lack of blame or responsibility.  Coronation Scene  The scene where everything was going fine but she just rejected rudely after anna was inquiring about the reasons for not opening the gates. She could have easily lied and not hurt her sister like that. Or I don't know handle her rejection  a little more lightly. Anna qualms was her sister acting so irrationally and very rudely with no real reason. Evidence, take note of what was Anna was shouting about when she had enough. No mention of hans but mostly how Elsa was a jerk. Elsa had the knowledge of her powers so she should take responsibility on handling her sister. She is the supposed older sister after all."
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jul 18 08:07:04 2015 UTC,"put Elsa into an idealistic position of being not responsible to anything.   She's eight and scared af, she just nearly killed her little sister. She's not responsible for the separation or Anna being locked inside, it's true, that's the parents' decision. Why are you trying to pin it on Elsa? Why do you assume her parents wouldn't have forbidden her from interacting with Anna? They make the decision to shut Elsa in the room, move her away from Anna into a different room and to explicitly keep her powers hidden from Anna, which would obviously includes not telling her about them - you don't think they'd have forbidden Elsa from interacting with Anna too much? They go through the trouble of moving Elsa into a different room behind a closed door, trying to keep her hidden from the world, but somehow would be fine with the girls interacting a lot? Allowing that would undermine all the trouble they went through in order to keep them separate, to keep Elsa's powers hidden.   For those three years she could just have talked to the girl without hurting her by I don't know letters, shouting, SOMETHING? That would only have prompted Anna to try to get to her and interact with her more, and she'd still had to have been rebuffed in the end, which is dangerous and goes against the parents' decision to keep Elsa's powers hidden and the girls separate.    You're blaming Elsa for not disobeying her parents and not putting Anna in danger.   Sure, it was all handled disastrously, but the fault lies with the parents who should have explained it all to Anna much better, not with the scared little girl who doesn't know what's wrong with her and can't control this frightening force that's a threat to everyone around her. She's afraid to touch her own parents ffs.   her sister acting so irrationally and very rudely with no real reason  no real reason did you watch the movie m8? Did you not see Elsa panicking during DYWTBAS? She's under a lot of stress and has essentially been brought up to believe that if anyone will find out about the powers, especially Anna whose mind has been magically tampered with and who must not know, all hell will break loose and there will be an uprising and a revolution (you remember Pabbie's light show about the crowd attacking Elsa and everything exploding as soon as they see her use her powers) . The coronation is probably the most stressful day ever for Elsa. Sure she doesn't shut Anna down too smoothly but she's emotionally very damaged.    Also, I have very little understanding for Anna, who seems very self-centered. I mean, Elsa, the crown heir, has been pretty much locked in her room for years and years, she can't even attend their parents funeral. Why the heck does Anna, the second-in-line to the throne, not suspect that something might be seriously wrong with Elsa? She's a royal princess, she's well aware the crown will go to her if it turns out that Elsa has some serious illness or insanity or such shit, but all, all she cares about is romance for herself. She has a duty to the kingdom, but she's just causing a goddamn scene in front of pretty much every single important collaborator or ally Arendelle has. If she has emotional pain she really should handle it better and have the confrontation with Elsa somewhere private.  Both of the sisters are in great pain, but Elsa is suffering more and is under far greater stress due to being afraid of herself. Sure, she could have handled things better, but Anna was also disastrously out of line. They both fucked up. The biggest fault, however, lies with the parents."
Frozen,3dmzrh,paspartuu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:22:41 2015 UTC,"Elsa had responsibility for she treated her sister all those years. Everytime Anna just wants to inquire about them, Elsa just immediately shuts her outs. Turns her back on her. Anna was asking her since she was a child the reason (do you wanna build a snowman). She knows something wrong but Elsa just keeps denying her. I know elsa had reasons to shut her sisters. The way she did it....she is fully responsible for it.   Anna had good reason to finally blow up in the dance it the dance. It was understandable. It was human. Elsa was starting to shut the gates. Going back to her comfort zone. Anna took her chance because she had enough.  Also, I have very little understanding for Anna, who seems very self-centered.  One criticism I would really like to give anna, that she should have been more furious with Elsa. I wish she was a little more 'self centered' or more expressive with her underlying anger. Anna was little too forgiving of Elsa.  Even Elsa in frozen fever had to say sorry for all those years."
Frozen,3dmzrh,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:41:25 2015 UTC,"Actually that's pretty much Elsa's objective, and the book seems to confirm that. Elsa wants to appear as someone whom Anna wouldn't want to talk to, as someone bad and rude that disliked Anna. That's the whole idea, so this way Anna can live her life happily and stop trying to look for Elsa and endanger herself."
Frozen,3dmzrh,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:23:30 2015 UTC,"So elsa came up with that and not the parents?, I know elsa had good intentions but that was pretty dickish. So when her sister was crying when their parents died, she refrained from giving her support even just for that moment?. I know Elsa doesn't mean to hurt Anna but she should be given responsibility for her actions. We give Anna responsibility for her mistakes even though she wasn't aware of what was happening. So it would be fair to have Elsa accountable for them."

Frozen,3dmzrh,Demian_Dillers,4,Sat Jul 18 10:06:20 2015 UTC,"My remarks are more personal (As most who have noticed me here, could guess Elsa is my favorite char in many layers, so, clearly). I do not believe Anna is so easy to be dismissed in this subject as you point somewhat aggressively on your posts here.  If I were to write a big post about it I'd say that of course Anna does have a lot to sympathize on this manner as well. In the end, I feel that Elsa triumphs for many reasons though."

Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"Queen Elsa of course. I don't know how you can think otherwise here to be honest.   Literally in your first post in the topic. That wouldn't have been a big deal at all normally - you're perfectly entitled to your opinion - but you're jumping at anyone who says Anna, and for some reason feel the need to debate a matter of personal feelings with them...so yeah, it comes across that way.   You know, Anna's problems were contingent to the problems of her sister. Elsa took the blow from the sword of oppression at the start.  Indeed, I can't see why anyone can think such when the film itself is pretty explicit with Elsa's struggle.   This could also be interpreted that way."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:56 2015 UTC,"That's actually exactly the problem with your posts: this isn't a ""debate"". It's a matter of personal feelings and opinions (it's not like anyone chooses to relate more with Elsa or Anna: they just do), and you are coming across as pretty aggressive and not very respectful of others by insisting to everyone that it has to be Elsa. Balance in all things, friend. This is supposed to be a friendly discussion."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"For me, Elsa's struggles generally represented the greater...more chronic, perhaps, problems in life. Depression[1], loneliness[2], not really knowing what you're doing with yourself or not being able to do what you're ""supposed"" to be doing (as defined by others, anyways), the loss of loved ones due to life circumstances and the consequences from such[2], etc. Anna also has some of her own - trying to the best of your abilities to fix things that you think you should be able to fix and still coming up short at every turn, the confusion and sadness you're bound to feel when close friends or family members push you away and leave you behind as inevitably happens throughout our lives (though it started unfortunately young for her), being ""lesser"" because of who she is and her station in her life (see More Than Just the Spare: even though this song never made it to the actual movie, I think at least some of its substance still plays a part, if subdued from how it was originally planned, in the movie), and probably others that I can't think of right now.  However, because of their respective parts in the movie...i.e. Elsa's part almost entirely consisting of emotional bits: self-discovery and important, very plot-centric dialogue between other characters; and Anna's not really having hardly any self-discovery at all (though she still has a decent share of emotional dialogue), and instead making up most of the meat of the movie itself in the ways that Elsa doesn't...Elsa comes across more as the truly troubled one whom we sympathize and relate with, while Anna, whom would normally be perfectly relatable with/sympathizable, gets kinda minimized in this regard because she's out on a grand adventure or whatever. Additionally, Elsa sort of steals the spotlight by having so little screen time while, contradictorily, also having (most of) the biggest moments of the movie. I would've rathered they'd been portrayed a little more equally - more screen time for Elsa, more personal struggle for Anna - but we got what we got (and it was great, so why complain, really?). Within just the movie, my vote would therefore go to Elsa, but in a meta perspective, I think they're much closer to equal, though different, obviously...and therefore, I won't vote, as per usual.  (e): Oh, I will say this, though: often times, you can't control whom you like or whom or what issues you relate with: these things often depend on personal life experiences, and not everyone has experienced the same things. Furthermore, sometimes certain characters/people just don't mesh well with you: it happens. I'd perfectly understand if somebody didn't much relate with Elsa, and instead related much more with Anna: I think that's perfectly okay and normal. Different strokes for different folks and all that. Personally speaking, I related a lot with Elsa until Let It Go: after that, I related much more with Anna (whom I'd found perfectly relatable before it, too, but more so after she really takes the spotlight). So, I can appreciate both characters, I guess.  [1]: I know she wasn't necessarily depressed, and if she was, it's hard to say to what extent, but I think she still at least represents it to some degree.  [2]: Anna sort of shares these ones with her, but ironically, while Anna has two entire songs devoted to them (Do You Want to Build a Snowman? for both loneliness and the departures of loved ones, and For the First Time in Forever for loneliness again), it somehow comes across as being even more extreme for Elsa, IMO."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"Hey :), yeah actually your post is great,  I think this pretty much points out how this can be viewed. Indeed both Anna and Elsa are characters with many layers that one can feel or relate more due different reasons. I do agree that Elsa is more an instrospective character and that Anna is more extrospective on their developments, with Elsa getting more layers of emotion to dissect in a completely independent manner while Anna is more dependent on her relationships with other characters and this Elsa ends up as a character one can relate personally while Anna is a character one can relate trough social experiences. This diminishes Anna's relatability compared to Elsa's for , what it seems to be, a majority of people.  BTW is [1] remarked because we talked about that a while ago?. To be honest I ultimately do agree that Elsa was depressed and represented that. I just believe that was a responsive depression due the circumstances rather than a clinical one, so she was able to truly recover once the circumstances improved without medication and treatment, which also means she doesn't get depressed for everything, just the stuff that was truly wrong.   And I think [2] is pretty clever actually. You are right, it is ironical and well, hard to explain how on the same subject, even during Anna's songs, one can feel the problems for Elsa on a more elevated level, perhaps due her own seclusion that comes off almost as self loathing or simply as craving for more than the more normal escapes Anna seemed to desire."
Frozen,3dmzrh,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jul 17 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed on everything before your second paragraph. In regards to [1], yeah, at least two people that I can think of didn't entirely agree with the notion that she may have had depression, so I decided to mark it just to be safe (and because I agree that it's hard to quantify absolutely - impossible, really - so it's the correct thing to do, regardless). I won't disagree with what you said in regards to clinical depression, but I will say that depression is a very complex beast, with various degrees of severity and how much/frequently it affects your life. For myself, for my own head canon, I think it's likely she did have ""clinical"" depression: it just wasn't completely debilitating, and nor was it constant: her life was not without its good moments even in the darkest of times. Even truly debilitatingly depressed people still have bright spots in between the dark, after all...and those people are usually able to make due with their circumstances a good amount of the time still, just as I'm sure she was able to.  [2]: Yeah, another poster, CarterDug, explained it fairly well in their comment in here, I think."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"I see :3, well that's very thoughtful. It is true trough, you're right, depression is indeed a very complex matter and it has many different layers, I've had first and second hand experience with it and thanks to certain experiences and whatnot I've learned a lot about it. It is indeed true that people with depression, any kind, does have good and even great moments in life, and as we've observed before Elsa certainly did have happy moments even on her worst situations. That being said, perhaps if there's a disagreement is just because we're using the therms differently. What do you mean when you say ""clinical depression""?."
Frozen,3dmzrh,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"...Well, let me Google the exact definition of ""clinical depression"" before I say anything else possibly stupid, :P... Okay, I can kind of work with this. It's not exactly what I thought it meant, though. I was thinking it meant more ""long term"" or chronic than necessarily severe and debilitating (from my quick Google, it appears to be the latter, not the former). I could definitely see that striking her at times, but I wouldn't think it'd be the norm, you're right. I was thinking more along the lines of a depression that's always with you...sometimes, it's really bad - as depression can be - but most of the time, it's more mild to moderate, something that's usually more just in the back of your head while you try to continue living normally: still affects how you think (self-loathing, for example, as you mentioned before, would not be entirely out of place) and act, but it hasn't completely taken over your life like clinical depression."
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,3,Fri Jul 17 18:00:00 2015 UTC,":3 I see, well yeah it's normal to misunderstand what we're expressing at times. Yeah I can get behind how you put it, she certainly had a long term period of depression that was really bad and well, seems pretty heartbreaking. I was also referring to the biological part, the fact that Elsa responded to the bad situation and thus was ""sad with reasons"", I mean her whole depression was due the severity of the situations and all that happened to her, however if it was an illness itself, the chemicals in her brain would be responding bad which would cause the depression, very very bad, and she'd need medication to balance them. Since all media seems to show she is pretty happy after her problems passed, I think she indeed doesn't have a biological problem that ruins how her brain functions after all, rather than just respond to bad situations."
Frozen,3dmzrh,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"Now, I may be wrong...but I'm pretty sure they didn't have medication to deal with depression back then...:P Is boiling chronic depression down to ""chemical imbalance"" really the way it's going nowadays? Yeah, I wish it were that simple...  Regardless, you raised some good points, and I don't have much of a counterargument: does seem odd she would recover that quickly...of course, we're seeing really limited windows of her life: I don't think it'd be out of the question that we're simply seeing the best of her...but since there's no proof of that, I must concede...for now. :D"
Frozen,3dmzrh,BartyMae,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"Depression of course have many layers and kinds, and you can be as affective responding to situations or if something was malfunctioning in your brain. That being said, there's no evidence or need to assume that Elsa is sick given the context of the movie, she never shows any kind of weird symptom aside from her response to the problems, where she gets her sadness problems. That's the point I was making. And while we may have seen little of her on the movie, we got more of Elsa on other material, that, while perhaps not canon, show how Elsa would be reacting on her life with Anna, and she seems pretty good. Recurring to author intentionality, it's more easily to determine Elsa is fine, given the whole purpose of the story is that she could have a fulfilling life after her reunion with Anna :P."

Frozen,3dl3uq,Klaw117,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"No, don't worry :).  Personally I don't go for the ""strong and independent woman"" archetype and I don't think Elsa needs to fill that role, but I too want Elsa to remain alone. I just see Elsa as a person who had never needed romance to be happy, and she can have other objectives, IMO that's completely fine and romance is over rated anyway as if it was the only medium of happiness, Elsa can have a fulfilling life without it. Something important is that Elsa doesn't need to reject romance, like say, Merida, she just could not show interest on it, it could just not appear on her life and that is totally fine and normal. From a story-line POV that's pretty great, opens other possibilities and it's actually something very original for a Disney main girl. She has so much going for her, magic, political power, being unique in the world, getting to know the world at 21 years old instead of at a normal age, she just has way too much in her life , it's very rich. And taking that into account, from a story-writing perspective, I'd consider it a waste if having so so much, her story will just fall into another ""romantic story"" scheme that can be seen with any normal char. I also consider independence (in a different way, hard and worthless to explain) and freedom important for her in a massive level (it was her utmost wish in Frozen) so just tying herself to anyone that way seems like something that doesn't match her. Finally I firmly believe Elsa would be absolutely terrible as a mother.  That being said, I can see interest points for developing an interesting story behind some romance ideas. However as of now, I can only see such interest point in Kristelsa given it would actually develop the three main characters a lot and could also be developed without being the main problematic/focus of her life while dealing with the rest of the objectives in life of the chars aside from romance."

I can't understand seriously twisting and breaking the point of stuff or force chars to a complete different mental setting and only focus them on romance for the ships to work, or chars that barely talk to each other or spent one day together or something, and work theories and arguments over that as if they were actually happening and defend that in an actual serious manner though."

They seem to have similar experiences with siblings. Anna had some insecurities of being the younger sister and Hans may have that too. Its further supported by 'Frozen Heart' excerpt. They seem to mirror each other pretty well and have good chemistry.   Even with the canon movie, I would like to see the two have a genuine chat of what happened. That's good character development for  the two and an unhealthy relationship would be amazing storywise.   Edit: On the question whether Hans was attracted to Anna, the movie is totally not clear.

It might be just be me, but I feel like you don't often see dress designs like this in fanart: most people seem to like sticking to the official outfits designs, or making mild revisions of them (or, in some artists' cases, not going for dresses at all, I guess, haha), so it's cool to see something like this, particularly with such a different color tone."

I am fond of strong, serious, threatening villains, and I think delving into regional myth would be a great direction for Frozen II. Sadly, it is very possible that Disney will continue to ignore the ""lore"" potential of Frozen and simply iterate ""princesses and sisterly love!"""
Frozen,3dkld4,Ysara,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, tell me if you'd like to hear my idea for the plot of Frozen2 (even though there's a slim chance it'l be implemented)."
Frozen,3dkld4,Ysara,2,Fri Jul 17 02:29:34 2015 UTC,Go ahead! Let's hear it!
Frozen,3dkld4,dragongt1994,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, here goes nothing...  This theoretical story begins with Elsa's new life in her kingdom. While the rest of Arendelle celebrates the wedding of Anna and Kristoff, Elsa's powers grow at a rate that she can't control. She worries that, once again, her powers could threaten those close to her...unless there was someone who could teach her. She concludes that there must be someone with talents like hers but more knowledge of how to reign them in and resolves to find such a tutor wherever he/she might be.  An opportunity to do so presents itself when Elsa is summoned to a gathering between delegates and officials from neighboring kingdoms (like the ones seen in the last movie) to discuss matters of diplomatic importance.So, leaving Anna and Kristoff to hold down the fort in Arendelle, she ventures off to the meeting only to learn the true intentions of her invitation. The dignitaries feverishly relate to her the haunting exploits of a mysterious wizard that has led a band of marauders to ransack their kingdoms with impunity. His mercenaries hoist all of the gold and valuables while the wizard only seems to content himself with relics or heirlooms of little inherent value. After gathering their spoils, the raiders would follow their leader into the wilderness, vanishing without a trace.  They beseech Queen Elsa to help them stop this phantom marauder and his cadre of thieves, as she may be the only one with the power to do so. Her hopes of finding a magic tutor turn sour as well as her hopes for a future where magicians can live in harmony with the world when she begrudgingly agrees to help them ambush this thief-king in his next port of call. They find that the wizard has arrived alone, yet manages to thwart his attackers with ease. By murmuring strange incantations under his breath he can extend his dominion over anything that falls under his shadow, summoning a menagerie of stone beasts and trolls from the soil that fell under his silhouette (conjecture based on descriptions of his powers). Only Elsa's raw power is able to subdue him in the end by completely freezing him in ice.  The captive wizard is then thawed out of his icy prison and dragged in chains before the dignitaries, most of whom call for severe punishment, but Elsa offers Janibas asylum in Arendelle if he agrees to use his skills to teach her how to control her powers. Based on the alternatives, he agrees.The wizard introduces himself as Janibas the younger, the last in a long line of war-like magicians who have lived in hermitage since the fall of their kingdom at the hands of the errant knight, Dietrich of Bern. The rest of the movie proceeds like Beauty and the Beast, only the Beauty is the Beast's captor. Though Janibas is well-mannered and teaches Elsa well, he is jaded and cynical until Elsa and her family show him the accepting and warm nature of the people of Arendelle. (Basically showing him the, ""Let it go"", philosophy, in regards to his past.)  Though something still seems amiss...Janibas eventually reveals that his tour of Larceny was intended to restore his magical connection to his belligerent ancestors and revive his war-like kingdom, though his new perspective and attachment to Elsa create an inner turmoil that builds up to a climactic resolution.  Shall I continue or is this getting pedantic?"
Frozen,3dkld4,Ysara,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:34 2015 UTC,are you sure that could work with a musical and 1 1/2 hr run time?
Frozen,3dkld4,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"I've fixed it up to make it seem a bit more lucid, which, from reading it, should hopefully make it seem shorter."
Frozen,3dkld4,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"This is wonderfully creative so far! I do have a few thoughts:   Elsa's powers continuing to grow and her being forced to face them again is somewhat repetitive. Though time has clearly progressed in your story, Elsa is facing the same dread specter: the overwhelming nature of her powers. This is something that she's already overcome; a sequel featuring such a similar character arc is prone to being more like a rehashing of old material. The beginning of events (nobles summon Elsa for help) feels a bit like the start of a D&D campaign. I can't see Elsa agreeing to (probably violently) confront a powerful marauder. She's not a combat sort, even if she has ice powers. Janibas interacting with the people of Arendelle sounds interesting. I always like it when OC get to mix with the existing characters of an IP; it allows their personality to resonate with the others and, hopefully, create a really good storytelling experience. Janibas has a strong character arc. At first, he was as selfish and despicable as he seemed; but he comes to regret this callousness when exposed to true kindness. This is a classic character arc, but it's effective.   Overall, I'd say this would make a fine fan fic (there are a number of reasons why Disney wouldn't do something exactly like this, though they might borrow a few concepts). But there's one Achilles heel I've noticed: the character development is all on Janibas, so far. Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff - the franchise's core characters - have not yet been forced to confront some part of themselves. Elsa's inability to control her powers is a start, if not a repetitive one, but it needs finishing. Why can't she figure out how to control them? What's stopping her? In the first movie, it was her isolationism and then callousness that prevented her from understanding love in a way that allowed her to control her powers. What is it this time? How does Janibas bring that out of her and allow her to resolve it? What are Kristoff and Anna up to? Are they side plot characters now? And, most importantly, does Sven finally get Olaf's carrot?   Shall I continue or is this getting pedantic?   A link to one of my post's in a similar, albeit Avatar: The Last Airbender, context. Thank you for your consideration, but I invited the explanation! In my opinion, just own it and hit me with everything :)"
Frozen,3dkld4,mavisbangs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words (and directing me towards such an interesting story). In hindsight, the beginning does feel sorely contrived, I might want to re-think it. As for Elsa, Anna and Kristoff's development, I stayed away from fleshing their arcs out in detail and wanted to focus purely on the premise to avoid getting too long winded...but since you don't mind, here we go for round 2! (I know Disney might never adopt this kind of story for legal reasons, but I hope at the very least they have a villain named Janibas...it's such a cool and novel name!...and by now in the public domain!)  Alright, screw the trip to the dignitaries...Elsa is busy trying to make up lost time with Anna, all while pursuing new interests of her own. She spends copious amounts of time searching through the castle, pouring over records, visiting the trolls outside Arendelle, trying to find out more about the world of magic and how much her parents knew about her gifts (how they knew where to take an ailing Anna all those years ago). Her curiosity is driven by the feeling that she can somehow make it up to Anna for all those years she spurned her if only she could gain a greater understanding of what caused her to withdraw in fear for so long. It almost becomes an obsession that makes her late for (I'm deciding between Anna and Kristoff's wedding or celebration of them having children...the latter would seem like a drastic time-skip but open some opportunity for character development as they'd be preparing to be parents...and Olaf prepares to be the nanny).   But, just as the festivities are ramping up, a black rider storms into the great hall, throwing everything into darkness and chaos. Elsa and the Royal Guards attempt to stop him, but he only shrugs off the guards and turns Elsa's ice powers against the crowd of well-wishers (with his ""Shadow-cloak"", which sort of functions like Hermione's bag, sucking up a stream of ice and re-emitting it at the crowd, freezing them solid.)  Now alone with the main characters, the rider declares after a tense silence (perhaps in the form of this pathetic attempt at a villain song) his intentions and identity.   ""I seek not gold, no not a penny,  For in this world, such things are many.  Nor would I suffer to see,  Harm befall your quaint fam'ly.  I am after one thing only,  That in all this world is lonely...  Go on now, do not dawdle!  It was the source of our fam'ly's squabbles!""  (They look confused)  ""You know it not?! Of course you do!  It fueled the feud 'twixt our fam'lies two!  Those of your line so brash and callous,  And those of the line...Janibas""  (They claim ignorance of it and Elsa tries to force him to leave)  ""Bah! I'll find it in good time!  I need only peruse your mind!""  He gives up singing (maybe for the best, it wasn't terrible was it?), and holds the shadow of his hand over Elsa's face, using his magic to peer into her mind and memories. He sees images of Elsa receiving the news of her parent's death at sea and grows frustrated as he reasons that they must have taken the relic he was looking for with them. Mounting his horse, he prepares to leave while singing a farewell note (I'll make it short)  ""I'm sad to say that I'm the source,  of that most tragic discourse.  (They look bemused and fearful)  ""They did not travel, they did flee  From the very likes...of...me""  With a look of contrition, he gallops of into the night, but Elsa isn't through with him yet as she dons a steed of her own and hastens after him. He knew something about her parents, and likely their relations to magic. She would find out what he knew...she owed Anna that much. She catches up to him and demands that he answer for terrorizing her subjects ( ""If I'd wanted to terrorize them, your highness, I'd have put on a show!"").  They fight until Elsa's raw power and proximity to her element (it's winter) win out over Janibas's skill. He is thawed from his icy tomb in front of an angry mob of Arendelle's populace, also recently thawed. He simply scoffs at their cries of scorn, apparently used to threats of being burned at the stake (""Oooh, tearing off my own limbs and feeding them to me, that one's new!""). Elsa comes between them, but says that if Janibas isn't a cooperative prisoner with her, she'll have to ""let the people decide"" his fate. He agrees to her terms.  The rest proceeds like I said, Beauty and the Beast, but with positions reversed. While settling in to life at the castle, Janibas actually reveals himself to be a gentleman despite having led a life of hermitage. While polite, he still behaves coolly towards Anna, Kristoff and especially Olaf (whom he regards as ""the little Homunculus""). Otherwise he exhibits nervous tendencies: jumping at shadows, murmuring in his sleep, an obsession with neatness, etc..  As Anna becomes accustomed to his presence, she begins to regard him with sympathy. She believes that the loneliness and hardships he faced made him the rogue he appeared to be, and that regarding him with acceptance and warmth, as Anna did for Elsa, may bring out the good in him (Her lessons from the trolls).  Kristoff, on the other hand, remains skeptical, even as he sees his positive qualities shine through. Eventually, after probing from Anna, he reveals that he had memories of his human parents. His father left him and his mother for seemingly noble reasons (that he can't remember), but it only resulted in hardship for them and death for his mother before the father eventually returned. He reasons that one can have respectable intentions that still make life miserable for others and pledges that he won't become that sort of father for their children (and he certainly doesn't want Janibas to be that sort of Uncle).         Meanwhile, Elsa tries to pry answers out of Janibas concerning his knowledge of their families' history and his skill with magic. Janibas explains that he is the last in a line of magicians bearing his name, that magic is a tradition in his family, not an aberration. He reveals that Elsa's ancestor, Queen Virginal who bequeathed to Elsa the power of ice, aided her consort, the zealous knight, Dietrich of Bern, in completely destroying the kingdom of Janibas long ago. He reasons that while his people may have had a penchant for war-mongering (including initiating the war that brought Dietrich upon them), they didn't deserve the annihilation that they received (""We conquered kingdoms and made them apart of our own, we didn't OBLITERATE them!""). He then goes into greater detail. He relates how Janibas (the first), saw the war against Dietrich as untenable and so retreated home to see his family one last time before his kingdom was toppled. He was later blamed by later generations for losing the war...  Janibas: ""If he'd loved his kingdom more-so than his family, we wouldn't be having this conversation...I'd be sitting on a throne in Castle Orkise, probably getting ready to invade your kingdom--  Elsa: ""Wai--what?!""  Janibas: ""And right now, I would be training you to lead an army--not this knitting-circle of a nation.""  Flabbergasted by this statement, Elsa decides that Janibas needs a detour before they continue their ""interviews"".   That's all I can write for now. I'll be back later for more... In the mean time, what do you think of my changes so far?"

Frozen,3dh1dy,LastUniqueUserID,3,Thu Jul 16 05:17:37 2015 UTC,I'd definitely watch it again on the big screen if I had a chance.
Frozen,3dh1dy,TeleVue,3,Thu Jul 16 05:30:37 2015 UTC,Me too.  I wouldn't even hesitate.
Frozen,3dh1dy,Portgas,2,Thu Jul 16 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"Same. Saw it many times on the big screen, but I'd be there in a heartbeat to watch it again."
Frozen,3dfek4,ArendelleKnight,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:03 2015 UTC,Mmm What do you think of all this old Snow Queen deal?
Frozen,3dfek4,Demian_Dillers,2,Thu Jul 16 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"It could be cool, just depends on how it's handled."
Frozen,3dfek4,Owyheemud,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"A long time ago in someone's tumbler account (Gingerhaole?) I saw a well-drawn set of drawings of Elsa and Skadi debating the value of love, and Elsa ending up threatening to use her powers against Skadi.  Seems that would be a good follow-on to this drawing set."

Frozen,3deijs,Demian_Dillers,4,Wed Jul 15 18:44:06 2015 UTC,Anna's on a roll every week.
Frozen,3deijs,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:02 2015 UTC,Even if she punches Elsa instead of Hans?
Frozen,3deijs,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 15 19:00:55 2015 UTC,Anna wouldn't punch Elsa.
Frozen,3deijs,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 15 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"What if; Anna had been reading many horror stories on the library until late. That day, Elsa had the brilliant idea to scare her sister as a prank. She made a mask out of ice and jumped on Anna right when she was leaving the library. Anna who was pretty scared by the horror stories, was vulnerable and blinded by fear, she just  reacts and punches the demonic maniac who had jumped in front of her. Effectively breaking the mask and punching Elsa by mistake. Elsa falls to the floor holding her face in pain while Anna heavy breaths trying to regain her breath."
Frozen,3deijs,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:45 2015 UTC,Obviously you know I meant she wouldn't punch Elsa on purpose...
Frozen,3deijs,Unterbaum,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"And you know I wasn't being serious on the second post, specially since we've already talked about this topic. Relax man, most of the time I just try to be playful with you :/."
Frozen,3deijs,Unterbaum,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"I know, I said it was OOC the last time we talked about it too.  It could happen on accident in the kind of hypothetical scenario you mentioned."
Frozen,3deijs,doggie015,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:58 2015 UTC,Would you like to see any punches other than to Hans for comedic purposes?
Frozen,3deijs,TheHappyJammer,2,Wed Jul 15 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"Another one of Anna's super powered punches?  Definitely, but first we need another character as unlikable as Hans. :P"

Frozen,3de7yq,BartyMae,3,Wed Jul 15 16:52:23 2015 UTC,Actually I feel the same way! Weird indeed.  But pretty good fanart.
Frozen,3de7yq,Demian_Dillers,3,Wed Jul 15 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"Lissa 42 does do a lot of Kristanna fanart.  I wouldn't be surprised if you've seen a similar picture from her.  I know she's done a few remakes of her older pictures too, maybe this is one of those."
Frozen,3de7yq,BartyMae,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"I actually tried to do a search in here using the fanart flair + ""kiss"", but I didn't see it or anything approximating it after looking at the results, which also lead to my conclusion that I was either having deja vu or it just happens to be similar to another work I've seen at some other time."
Frozen,3df4a7,ArendelleKnight,4,Wed Jul 15 19:52:48 2015 UTC,Oh they gave him the seagull! hahaha.
Frozen,3df4a7,Demian_Dillers,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"I was gonna slap you for that thumbnail (that's no snowman!), but instead I'm just gonna express my disdain for Funko Pop. They manufacture figures of nearly every character, but they produce a seagull from a snowman's imagination before Prince Hans? Bunk! Bunk I say!"
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,2,Wed Jul 15 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"They manufacture figures of nearly every character   So far they've produced Marshmallow, Kristoff, Sven, 4 variants of Olaf, 4 variants of Elsa, and 3 variants of Anna.  That's 6 characters total, 7 if you count the seagull.  They still haven't produced Agnarr, Iduna, Oaken, Kai, Gerda, The Duke of Weselton, The Duke's guards, the Snowgies, Pabbie, Bulda, Cliff, or Hans.  Also that seagull is at least 10 times more likable as a character than Hans, so there's that."
Frozen,3df4a7,gazza3478,3,Wed Jul 15 21:27:38 2015 UTC,Oaken   I need this!
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,3,Wed Jul 15 21:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hopefully in series 3.  I'm sure series 3 will include yet another variant each of Anna and Elsa, (in their Frozen Fever dresses) but other than that there's plenty of room for more characters."
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,2,Wed Jul 15 22:48:23 2015 UTC,Even Prince Hans?
Frozen,3df4a7,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jul 16 01:04:45 2015 UTC,It's a possibility.  Definitely more likely than some of the others I mentioned.
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"You & many others may loathe Prince Hans, but he's actually rather popular for a character. Sure, Disney may not produce much merchandise with him, but more often than not their website store is out-of-stock of one of the three toys featuring Prince Hans. He's often on Amazon's top one hundred dolls for pre-school aged children, sometimes outselling Kristoff & Queen Elsa herself!  People like Prince Hans, people want to buy Prince Hans, & despite your loud protests, Prince Hans will be redeemed."
Frozen,3df4a7,Demian_Dillers,3,Wed Jul 15 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"Actually that's not how market analysis works at all :/. In fact, the mere point that few merchandise exists with Hans means that merchandise is more likely gonna sell more than a bunch of individual merchandises about more featured characters. If there's 100 kinds of toys about X, and just 2 about Y, the 2 about Y are more likely to sell more than 50 kinds of X, which doesn't mean Y is more popular, it's just rarer, but in the aggregate certainly is far less profitable. Not to mention the limited  data you're working with.  Not trying to attack you, just want to clarify that the conclusions you are reaching are based on skewed data and incorrect methods, not your fault, it's pretty difficult to actually make a good study of such a big franchise, but then using incomplete data leads to nothing."
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm working with the limited data I can obtain.  I have been browsing the Disney store website daily to track inventory & rating patterns, so from my observations of watching the first edition Prince Hans come & go in availability, I can conclude the store is not supplying enough of that product to meet demand."
Frozen,3df4a7,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jul 16 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm working with the limited data I can obtain.   Yeah I pointed out that.    I have been browsing the Disney store website daily to track inventory & rating patterns, so from my observations of watching the first edition Prince Hans come & go in availability, I can conclude the store is not supplying enough of that product to meet demand.   Well, that might be true, however there's also the case if it's worth increasing the offer due the marginal costs of production. They might need to produce a set number of X products in order to meet the costs, let's say right now they offer and sell Z, increase the offer to X however only sell Y, they would be losing. Well, there are more variables to analyze and whatnot in the end as long as they are selling everything they are winning.  In any case I do not want to discourage you, it's actually pretty cool you are interested in that stuff :). Just explaining that the conclusions are not supported enough to hold an argument and take it as hard evidence of something, that data value is not that big overall for everyone, although they might certainly be enough to take a position and take an opinion /hug."
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:26 2015 UTC,"I know you are just trying to help educate me. Thank you. I understand some economics (it was my intended major).  I gathered data in any way I can. Disney, nor any other company, will likely divulge such specific information, so my observations are the best I can obtain."
Frozen,3df4a7,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jul 16 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see you understand them, more than most I encounter at least.  And yeah I understand that, well in any case it's pretty cool you have that data, you make a good effort there.   I didn't imagine you had an interest on economics that way though, in any case that's a cool thing to know."
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,3,Thu Jul 16 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"Economics is basic understanding of supply & demand, yo. If people want something enough, they will be willing to exchange for it. If an item is selling out then perhaps increase production or increase the price.  It's the best only method to gauge popularity available to me, particularly the Amazon Top 100 listings. The Disney Store website used to include likes for specific products from Facebook users, though that likely exposed the divide in popularity between Snow Queen Elsa & Princess Anna."
Frozen,3df4a7,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:45:29 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's the basic, true. However how elastic the demand for said product is, the competitors and complementary products can be big factors on taking such decisions, also how it would impact different markets and selling methods.  Yeah, likes might now be a good method over all, specially for products.  And yup I understand what you mean, gathering more data could be pretty difficult if not impossible. However you know what I think of said method now. Of course, in the end it's still interesting for observation and it does have certain value, however I'd say it's value is more important on a comparative level with other franchises rather than inside its own."
Frozen,3degd7,dragongt1994,8,Wed Jul 15 17:08:29 2015 UTC,"Long term physical and emotional woulds caused by different kinds of traumatic events, basically. Things worse than death or terrible traumatic stuff, I'm sure many can imagine different situations. To be honest most would be clichés that don't really fit in Frozen due the structure, thematic and form of resolution of the story, making a traumatic and tragic event just because, doesn't hold well for a good story. Others might be straight out from horror movies, and in the end would be completely over worked. Of course there's bad stuff that could be more fittin.  Just to play along let's put a really nightmarish scenario.  Anna Froze completely saving Elsa. As Elsa cried over her, she noticed Anna started to move, to move but not to warm up. She looks up, Anna is alive, but she's still Ice.  Yes, Anna managed to half-break the curse but she wasn't fast enough. She ends up surviving, living, but living as an ice being, having a cursed existence forever. It gets worse, the curse twists her soul and corrupts her mind. As love is Frozen around her, it plants the seed of hatred and self loathing. Kristoff, Hans, no one, no man could ever want to be with her that way. Elsa tries to repair her but she can't, Anna lives as a damned monster  suffering each minute, without being able to taste, smell or feel anymore, even colors aren't colors but all shades of blue and white. Her existence is dry and  her experiences are blank. Everyone fears her, no one can touch her without getting frostbite. She tries to suicide by setting herself on fire or standing on the sun but the ice is too strong, nothing happens. She's cursed to walk the world, immortal, until a supernova finally consumes everything, she can't die. On her suffering she starts hating Elsa, her soul is twisted and broken, her love dies and only suffering remains, she loathes herself, she loathes everything. Kristoff tries to help the girls, he becomes an important support for Elsa, for her life, but Anna gets jealous, she thinks Elsa is taking everything from her. Until one day she goes after Kristoff and kills him, asphyxiating him with her icy hands, ice was his life, ice was his dead. After that, her self-loathing takes the best of her, she just beats up Elsa, she leaves Elsa bleeding and broken and then runs away from the kingdom, runs to find a cure, something that quenches her  suffering or something that at least kills her, but it's useless. Elsa looks for a cure herself, she consumes her life consulting everything, but there isn't one.  Anna will always just suffer and hate everyone, until the end of the world, and it's all Elsa's  fault."

I took it as a new experience, interesting, exiting and an adventure. I will always remember clearly how I took the first bite, this is kind of good, and then the second...always that second bite. And you know why I'll always remember that?, because there was a fucking giant worm on that friggin thing and I almost bit it!. ARRRGGAGA a worm, , IN MY FOOD. I got traumatized for life, and since then I haven't eaten pears ever again."

But here Anna never regains her abilities to triumph over her injuries it will be called ""frozen 2 the burning hearts"" Elsa and Anna learn love is not something you can touch or feel but something that can only be felt with the heart and soul. Thru these suffering times Anna and Elsa learn they love each other and can't live without one another and Disney introduces the new generation of kids into Lesbianism.   No edit. but I just realized this is incest maybe love doesn't have to be physical and Kristoff and Anna learn this :)"

It was revealed to the parents in the beginning that the only other way to stop her powers is to kill her making it more adamant to lock the family out.  Anna would be sad but she would adjust pretty well after some point. Anna and Elsa never had sisterly bonding at that point and Anna seems to be pretty normal so she wouldn't kill herself. Anna would probably Mature faster than intended. I think she has some training since she is the second heir and because her sister has ice powers, giving her the some training wouldn't be a bad Idea"

Frozen,3dc21x,dragongt1994,3,Wed Jul 15 04:09:31 2015 UTC,Everybody would be devastated and the tale would be a tragedy and we wouldn't get a happy ending. I'd hate it a lot and never watch again.
Frozen,3dc21x,lafielle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yup. And it wouldn't be a good story because it would be pretty pointless. Anna's rad would take her to...be a Queen?, pretty pointless for the character meanwhile the magic is gone, the story really wouldn't work out more than being a messy tragedy but lose all impact on the resolution after trying to build the chars."

Frozen,3dc21x,lafielle,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"1) In many regards the death of Elsa would have results very similar to the death of Agnarr and Iduna three years earlier - with the current ruler dead, the crown would pass to the next in line, and as before, that would-be Queen would be too young by Arendellian law to be crowned right away. Elsa was 18 when Agnarr and Iduna died, and she had to wait until she was 21 to take the throne, so Anna, being 18 when Elsa died, would likewise need to wait to take power. Presumably the same regent or regency council that held power before would continue to rule the nation, which would give Anna time to grieve.  The first act of the re-established regency council would be to arrange a funeral for Elsa. As with the parents, there is no body to bury, so a third stone would likely be added between the two erected for Agnarr and Iduna. Anna would likely have the stone feature some type of ice motif, in honor of her sisters true self, though it will not be made out of ice due to the lack of permanence should there ever be a warm summer. Kristoff, Sven and the Trolls attend the funeral.  However, with this most necessary act out of the way, it would soon become apparent that there is one very, very large difference between the deaths of Agnarr and Iduna and the death of Elsa. Where the sinking of a ship in the storm can be described as nothing less than a terrible tragedy, the death of Elsa cannot be blamed on the weather. She was murdered.  The Duke of Wesselton, involved in a plot, but not actually personally guilty of murder, would likely be banished and all trade with Wesselton stopped, much the same as the movie. But dealing with Hans would be a far harder nut to crack. The normal penalty for regicide is death by extended torture, but Anna would likely intervene. Even if she is not queen yet, a call for mercy from the one most affected by the murder would be very hard to ignore, so likely Hans would instead be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in some type of icy prison on the far side of the country.  Unfortunately, this great mercy cannot avoid what must happen next:  Arendelle's queen was murdered in cold blood by a Prince of the Southern Islands. Regardless of what Anna may want, the moment Elsa's heart stopped beating... Arendelle went to war.  The regency council, realizing the truth of this matter, summons the levies of the lower nobility and orders ships be built for an invasion of the Southern Islands. Anna would try to fight this decision at every corner, but the council would be unrelenting, forcing Anna to seek help from Pabbie and the trolls. The sad part is, Pabbie would tell her the council is right.  Failing to respond to the murder of the ruling sovereign would be a giant signal to other kingdoms that Arendelle is incapable of protecting its most valuable resources. There is simply no way Wesselton would not invade to take the most fertile and productive lands, even to enslave the Arendellian people - a risk especially after the end of trade relations and the humiliation of their Duke. And that is presuming the Southern Islands themselves accept the punishment of Prince Hans - which they won't.  Seeing Pabbies arguments, Kristoff would realize the old troll was right and that war was indeed unavoidable, but no matter how true, this would be unacceptable to Anna. Feeling her friends turned against her and having no family left, she would withdraw herself into the palace as her sister did before her... utterly alone.  (If people want, I'll write more)"
Frozen,3dc21x,lafielle,2,Wed Jul 15 11:49:09 2015 UTC,"Please sir or lady, moar because moar"
Frozen,3dc21x,lafielle,3,Wed Jul 15 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"2) For months, Kristoff and Sven would visit the castle every day, trying to talk to Anna, but as her sister had done before her, Anna kept the door closed. The castle staff was used to keeping up the castle locked, and the regency council handled matters of state as before, so everything appeared to continue on as it had before Elsa's coronation. Though at the time Anna had hated the isolation, right now it was the only thing she had left. She clung to it.  Anna wouldn't notice the small changes to the palace building up over the months. The suits of armor in the halls were removed. The bust of the beautiful stranger, tall and fair disappeared. First the painting of Joan, and then the other paintings would be removed. Anna did not care enough to notice as the palace was stripped. She didn't miss art or armor... she missed her sister.   But then, Gerda went missing. Gerda, the female servant who had been with the family since the reign of her father, had disappeared. And this, Anna noticed.  After hearing Gerda had been fired by the regency council, Anna would put on her cloak and mittens and march out of the palace to speak to the council about this, but her train of thought would be most rudely interrupted when she opened the door:  The entire city was covered in clouds of black smoke emanating from the corners of the city. The forests around the city had been cut down, leaving only tree stumps. And the people outside the palace looked destitute, a man missing an arm begging for scraps, people in ragged clothes scurrying about, houses in disrepair. Something was very, very wrong.  (More coming!)"
Frozen,3dc21x,Darthvaderisnotme,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"3) Anna would soon learn the depths into which Arendelle had been plunged. The beautiful forests surrounding the city had been cut down for wood to build warships. Forges and foundries had been constructed to make weapons and they were pumping black smoke into the air. It was there that the suits of armor from the palace had been reforged into more modern weapons. Wounded had come back from the front line.  But it was not just the war. Without trade with Weselton, the Arendellian economy had suffered, and with the cost of war, the regency council had been forced to sell the art and eventually fire the staff. Thats why Gerda had disappeared.  Seeing the suffering of her people, Anna would feel forced to take action - any action - to help. And being a smart girl, she would eventually come up with a plan. Asking Kristoff for help, she would travel to Corona, the Tangled Kingdom, on a trade mission. Establishing trade with Corona would be huge for Arendelle, as it could help revitalize the economy, bringing jobs and helping to reduce poverty. Everything would ride on the outcome of this mission...  Trade negotiations would be tough at first. The King has assigned the task of the negotiations to his minister, who turns out to be entirely unsympathetic to Arendelle's cause. Anna of course has zero knowledge of macro-economics and soon finds herself in trouble. Unbeknownst to her, the minister wants to stop a deal no matter the cost as he is paid by the Duke of Wesselton, and he argues that Arendelle's primary export is ice, of which Corona needs only a limited amount.   Worse, since Anna needs a deal far more than Corona does, the fair deal Anna proposes is simply not good enough. Led by the minister, the merchants of Corona walk out of the negotiation, leaving Anna with nothing. They know she'll need to come back to them, begging and offering an unfair deal that benefits Corona far more than it does Arendelle.  Kristoff, more familiar with such tactics having been poor and having negotiated for work he needed more badly than potential employers needed that work done, explains the situation to Anna, who once again is left with the feeling of helplessness that has haunted her ever since her sisters death, and tears begin to flow.  Drawn in by the sound of crying, a woman with short brown hair, wearing a pink dress enters the room. It is Princess Rapunzel - and unlike the money-grabbing ministers and merchants, she is far more sympathetic. Listening to Anna's tale, and finding Anna to be a kindred spirit, the princess vows to help, and goes to speak with her father.   Together with a passionate plea by Anna for help, the King is deeply moved, but the minister strongly objects. As much as Corona may want to help Arendelle, if Arendelle has nothing to offer in return, Corona cannot accept the trade - no good king can allow his own people to suffer to help another kingdom. The King, seeing his hands tied, decides to give the matter another day of thought and the minister wrings his hands, knowing he'll soon get a big payout from Weselton.  Anna is inconsolable for a moment as she sees the deal slipping through her fingers. Kristoff tries to comfort her, but fails, and Rapunzel isn't really able to offer help either. Until the formerly long-haired princess unintentionally makes a single statement that will give Anna a brilliant idea, and that will change the course of history. ""Isn't there anything that Arendelle can offer to Corona?""  Revitalized, Anna jumps up and returns to the throne room, where the minister is explaining how bad of an idea it is to trade with Arendelle, because it after all has nothing to offer. Anna interjects: Arendelle does have something to offer.  With strength, Anna stands tall and declares that she is no longer offering just trade with Corona. As future queen, she offers an alliance with Corona - after all, Arendelle may have a weak economy, but it has a very strong navy now. Corona's army is mostly land-based. The minister tries to object but Anna is unrelenting. Seeing the benefits of this, an alliance and trade treaty is signed between Corona and Arendelle, on one condition: that Anna's first born marry Rapunzels first child.  Walking away with a deal, Anna is ecstatic, but Kristoff is quite upset, calling her foolish and impulsive for signing away her future son or daughters right to chose whom they love. The two bicker, but then a messenger rides in, on horseback through the halls of the palace, interrupting their argument. Running after the horseman, Anna and Kristoff are just in time to hear the news being announced to the king: the Southern Island fleet, supported by the armies of Wesselton, are attacking Arendelle!  (Final part coming later today)"
Frozen,3dc21x,lafielle,2,Thu Jul 16 07:25:21 2015 UTC,"4) Fearing a deal between Corona and Arendelle, the Southern Islands and Wesselton decided to strike first, before the Arendelle economy could be revitalized. Since they now have an alliance, Corona assembles its troops with great haste, and leading this army Anna, Kristoff, Rapunzel and Flynn Rider take all the ships they can find, fishing vessels, pleasure yachts, ferries, to get the army to Arendelle.  When they arrive, they find the city is besieged and blockaded. The Southern Islands have the city completely surrounded, and cannonfire towards the Corona fleet forces them to keep their distance - the Corona ships aren't warships, and they don't have cannons. They can't fight the Southern Islands without landing their troops. Then things get worse: realising that the Corona fleet is nothing but a bunch of overcrowded, unarmed vessels, the Southern Island fleet raises their anchors and turn to engage. All seems like it will be lost...  Sudden there is a change in the wind. A cloud of ice particles, not unlike the ones Anna saw when Elsa died, is blown in by the wind, and everything begins to freeze. The water hardens and heavy snow begins to fall, freezing all the ships in place. Anna orders the troops to exit the ships and Kristoff and Flynn lead the charge against the Southern Island troops, charging the enemy ships over the ice! From the city, the Arendelle troops charge in as well, catching the Southern Island forces between the two.   One by one Hans' brothers fall, killed with their troops. The Duke of Wesselton is captured trying to escape. The blue ice turns red with Southern Island and Wesselton blood... until just Hans remains, standing on the ice, alone again. But this time there is no sister to strike... and he is forced to surrender his weapon.  Anna steps forward to a disarmed and captured Hans. She looks at the bodies of his brothers, at the blood on the ice, tears in her eyes.  The leader of the regency council orders Hans executed, but Anna stops them once more. There will be no more bloodshed. Instead, there is going to be a feast. To celebrate the victory. To hold her immediate coronation, as the country clearly didn't do well with the regency council in charge... and to celebrate her marriage with Hans.  The council look at one another in disbelief, but Anna is not making her decision lightly. Her sister Elsa understood something which so far Anna herself had not. That sometimes one must sacrifice ones own freedom for the greater good. That as queen, if she was a danger to her people, she had to leave. And like her sister, Anna too has to make a sacrifice for her people. A marriage with Hans will secure peace, which her country needs more now that ever. It is not what she wants - but it is what Arendelle needs.  An icy chill passes over all.  The end."

Frozen,3dbuw7,dragongt1994,5,Wed Jul 15 12:02:26 2015 UTC,"Mmm let's not just dismiss the entire point of the article, this actually raises pretty good ideas, focusing on Elsa's powers seems a no brainer in many ways.  But of course there are reservations about making it a superhero movie if there's too much focus on it, however the good new is, it doesn't have to become one!. Even given that there's many kinds of super hero movies, Frozen can keep away from that, Elsa doesn't need to become a vigilante or a world soldier, however that doesn't mean she can't make much more awesome stuff with her powers , learn to control them even in fear (a development point I consider almost absolutely necessary on the character), she can have action sequences and battle stuff, without being a super hero. All of this can be found on fantasy movies, and Frozen is one.  I do agree that one of the strongest points of Frozen is that the girls can be awesome by being girly, they don't need to be rebel/non-fitting tomboyish like Merida, Mulan or the girls in HTTYD, no, they are pretty lady mannered and still can do awesome stuff and I believe that speaks to little children but also to wide audiences on many levels, much more than just taking LiG out of context even.  Both Elsa and Anna are fantastic characters that way, with Anna learning more stuff in the future, Elsa could potentially be a really dangerous and badass lady that doesn't need to be evil, doesn't need to be a non-human entity, doesn't need to be a team up with a male more daring char and doesn't need to be tomboyish. She could still be the elegant and delicate-mannered Elsa and still be able to do incredible stuff and defeat stuff with her powers on her own. I think that's an interesting point to expand and that could serve to inspire more with the character.  All in all, I really hope they don't go thematic, fire queens or princesses or more elementals or more ice, no please, leave that alone. I also don't think we need to know the origin of Elsa's powers, but I do think there could be more sorcerers or magical creatures, and with imagination, A LOT can be made."

Frozen,3dbuw7,Demian_Dillers,3,Wed Jul 15 05:44:51 2015 UTC,"Yep,which would be bad"
Frozen,3dbuw7,Portgas,3,Wed Jul 15 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"More of Elsa's powers   Definitely. I'd be nice to explore how powerful she can become.    More superpowered princesses!   Please no. That's a terrible idea. And no, the story shouldn't focus on where Elsa got her powers and where is magic come from. That totally defeats the whole point of them being unexplained. And no, it's not a superpower. It's just magic."
Frozen,3dbuw7,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 15 08:25:57 2015 UTC,"I complete agree, and especially regarding the source of Elsa's powers.  It always drives me crazy when people refer to that as a plot hole in Frozen.  It doesn't matter where she got her powers!"

Right when Anna and Kristoff were about to marry and 3 years after the events of Frozen they are just getting to know each other...talk about both being asocial weirdos.

Frozen,3d7xrf,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:38:20 2015 UTC,"Van Helsing (film):       Van Helsing is a 2004 American fantasy action directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman as vigilante monster hunter Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious. The film is an homage and tribute to the Universal Horror Monster films from the 1930s and 1940s (also produced by Universal Studios which were in turn based on novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley), of which Sommers is a fan.  The titular character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Distributed by Universal Pictures, the film includes a number of monsters such as Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man and House of Dracula.  Despite mostly negative reviews, the film grossed over $300 million worldwide and did well with the general public, becoming one of the biggest blockbusters released in 2004.

I understand what you mean, many of my favorite chars are ones that I don't relate that much (like Masaru of Digimon), but of course there's always some liking/admiration or some level of relatability to the choices and whatnot, that characters make that we like.

I liked this one because it wasn't trying. It's really hard because the hair isn't realistic for actual people so it looks strange. I think the most accurate Elsa I've seen is this one  Also didyou think OUaT Elsa resembled her? I think both OUaT Elsa and Anna were excellent (though I am in the minority in wishing they hadn't been eclipsed by the boring Snow Queen who just stole a big chunk of Elsa's storyline). I though she really looked like her when her hair was up, but when it was down the skinny brain kind of ruined it. It was nice not having a wig, but a bit of extra volume would have helped."

Frozen,3d2cm5,Demian_Dillers,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:14 2015 UTC,"You mean Elsa is a villain for the audience within the same story?.  IDK, if Elsa kept being a villain the whole thing would've had to play differently the entire psyche and feel of the character would've been a very different side. In any case I guess this would've kept Hans as a Good character, and while it seems interesting now, I think it would have felt pretty uninspired as far as the actual movie goes. Hans being a bad-guy that actually wasn't so bad so he didn't do anything bad and he can be easily forgiven and whatnot, just wouldn't have had the same charm, because Hans char wouldn't have had any impact instead just having a lame excuse to actually let Anna be with Kristoff with a good reason for the Princess without playing broken hearts."

Frozen,3cy05a,creepycherry,3,Sat Jul 11 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, he appeared way too conveniently at that point in the mountain. We just have to wait until he tries to either kill or woo Elsa and then Anna punches him (and maybe she punches Elsa too depending on how successful he was) . Apparently after that, Svanna is canon."
Frozen,3cy05a,MesePudenda,4,Sun Jul 12 00:00:27 2015 UTC,"I doubt Svanna could be canon, when Anna ""really loves [Elsa]"". You've heard it straight from Disney now."

Anyone find it odd that he's so sure he knows the film, it's like he's full of prejudices (like a lot of people who choose to hate Frozen without bothering to see it).

Frozen,3cz26e,Deviantart-Mirror,3,Sun Jul 12 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"Revenge? But Kristoff didn't do anything to Hans...in fact, if Hans' plot had been successful, it would've been thanks to Kristoff getting Anna to Elsa and then back to Arendelle and then trusting her safety with Hans..."
Frozen,3cz26e,BartyMae,3,Sun Jul 12 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe this is taking the path of the novelization. on the novelization if the movie, Hans is about to kill Elsa while she's hugging the frozen Anna, but Kristoff saves her by punching the sociopath.   Behind her, Hans was fuming. He quickly picked up his broken sword and started to swing it at Elsa, but Kristoff ran at him just in time. He hit Hans right on the jaw and knocked him down. There would be no second blows for Hans.   So, that way Hans could want revenge on him."
Frozen,3cz26e,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jul 12 08:07:42 2015 UTC,His mere presence is an excuse enough...
Frozen,3cz26e,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jul 12 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"This could actually be a plot point. Kristoff is working on the ice fields really early, he doesn't like to work near the others. Suddenly he sees a weirdly uniformed soldier riding towards him. It all happens too fast, and the reindeerman gets a sword trough the chest , there's a note attached that reads ""Dear Anna, me, Prince Hans, wanted to send my regards, I trust you'll appreciate my delivering"".  Hans ultimate revenge would be payed with his torture, throwing him into prison where the Prince would become the ""maiden"" of a group of thugs for life."
Frozen,3cz26e,creepycherry,2,Sun Jul 12 08:11:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, so many downvotes. I can almost smell the butthurt. If Kristoff would've stabbed Hans then this picture would've been on the frontpage."
Frozen,3cwekd,dragongt1994,4,Sat Jul 11 10:01:36 2015 UTC,I love that they had this line in there. I guess Anna can listen through the fourth wall. The reactions to that line were golden too. And again I wish we'd gotten more of Kristoff (and Elsa).
Frozen,3cwekd,Theroonco,2,Sat Jul 11 13:01:49 2015 UTC,Oh yeh another thing I like is the kristoff and elsa interactions. They have great chemistry. Planted the seeds of kristelsa in my mind
Frozen,3cwekd,Theroonco,2,Sat Jul 11 13:13:41 2015 UTC,Do you ship that now or is it just something you're open to?
Frozen,3cwekd,Theroonco,3,Sat Jul 11 13:50:44 2015 UTC,"Iam open to it, mostly because it seems interesting development for Anna. What would Anna do if kristoff broke up with her and went with Elsa. It would break my heart to see Anna cry but I want my heart to be crushed anyways. It opens new dimensions for Anna"

Frozen,3ctjqi,Demian_Dillers,6,Fri Jul 10 20:27:03 2015 UTC,Jack Frost actually sounds like a pretty cool character. It's the whole Jelsa thing that has tainted his image though since he tends to be associated with that sort of thing now.

Frozen,3cr3w9,HeimrArnadalr,2,Fri Jul 10 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"Reverse image search comes with this: http://www.great-kids-birthday-parties.com/frozen-font.html  It's available without the watermark for free with a simple click... odd, knowing the watermark in this image is on the 7. This means he either screenshotted it from the page with the watermark, or just googled it and took it off the images page.  I would suspect this means the site itself is probably of no consequence, and the message he wanted was the 7. Possibilities?  Furious 7? July?"
Frozen,3cr3w9,Tetragramation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that he just googled it, it's the first thing that comes up if you google ""frozen font 7"" As for the meaning, I have no idea"
Frozen,3cr3w9,TheEaterOfFood,2,Sat Jul 11 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"Well, if we review...  The morse code translated to binary which led to a google definition link, which had a planted ""See Wiki"" in it (because, in my time, I've never seen a ""See Wiki"" on any google definition).  That led to the small-text link on the wiki primer, so it seems this code functions less on hidden data/metadata and more on the meaning...  Frozen Fever is 7 minutes long? The 7th /r/Frozen discussion thread?"
Frozen,3cr3w9,Tetragramation,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice the planted ""See Wiki"", but if you search up the definition on google you do get a identical definition minus the ""See Wiki""  Also since the wikipage was edited 15 days ago by /u/OrangeFeels it is likely he is the one who made this code puzzle thingy.   Searching up 7, gets us the 7th discussion thread, but appears to have nothing related to this on it. Frozen Fever seems possible to be the next step in the code, not sure where to look for that though Unlikely, but the sidebar does have 6 rules, is there possibly a mystery 7th one? The world will end in 7 days"
Frozen,3cr3w9,TheEaterOfFood,2,Tue Jul 14 13:19:07 2015 UTC,Contest! 7! Maybe the 7th r/Frozen contest? Maybe the 7th entry in the most recent contest?  I also deduced it was /u/OrangeFeels a while ago. I couldn't find any other edits though.  Any updates?

Frozen,3cr5by,XNinja2017,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:38:04 2015 UTC,That seems appropriate.   Would you watch it with better eyes if the general opinion of critics and the fandom said it's pretty good and there's not even hints of Jelsa? (Then again shippers would find hints on anything).
Frozen,3cr5by,CarterDug,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't have anything in particular against RotG.  I haven't even seen it, but from what I've heard it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense as a crossover, even without making it worse with Jelsa."
Frozen,3cr5by,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even without Jelsa, it doesn't make sense at all and putting that mythology there actually would ruin Frozen's world. It's not a bad movie however, you should watch it."
Frozen,3cr5by,AnonnyMiss,3,Fri Jul 10 06:20:08 2015 UTC,"How much would you freak out?   I'd have a good chuckle at first, then I'd watch the Frozen fandom galvanize like no fandom ever has before. This may be the first time a fanbase forces a studio to cancel a movie. The push back will be thousands of times worse than when Ben Affleck was announced as the next Batman.   What would you expect from it?   I expect it to be physically awful, but I won't be watching it anyway.   How much would this blow on their faces?   Probably not that much. Even if the film is a net loss, I don't see it having long lasting financial ramifications outside of the loss from the film itself. People won't stop watching Disney movies because of this, and the ones who would weren't watching many Disney movies to begin with. The only thing it might do is lower stock prices temporarily as shareholders lose confidence in Disney's management. The announcement might even be a ploy to lower stock prices so that Disney can buy back some of its shares before conveniently deciding to cancel the project."
Frozen,3cr5by,XNinja2017,3,Fri Jul 10 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt that this would result in a serious financial loss for them though. Frozen is such a massive franchise worldwide, and that coupled with the sentimental value that many fans developed for it would not be pretty for Disney. It would hit them hard and fast."
Frozen,3cr5by,AnonnyMiss,3,Fri Jul 10 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"I could honestly see a Frozen/RotG sequel breaking even or better, and even if there is a loss, it will be split between two studios. Outside of the losses from the movie itself, I don't see this having a long term negative impact on the company as a whole. People won't stop buying Disney or Frozen merchandise because of this sequel, anymore than they would had there been no sequel at all. Disney is much more than just Frozen.  Edit: AC"
Frozen,3cr5by,XNinja2017,3,Fri Jul 10 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"I like that you are being realistic here. Honestly though, it would taint the image of Frozen severely if this collaboration doesn't outright kill the franchise initially. It could harm Disney's reputation though, and that is something that can persist for a very long time. Not only would it affect them financially, but also their company image. I am sure they have done more controversial things before though, but I am not the best guy to address this subject."
Frozen,3cr5by,AnonnyMiss,3,Fri Jul 10 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Not only would it affect them financially, but also their company image. I am sure they have done more controversial things before though, but I am not the best guy to address this subject.   I agree, which is why I included the bit about stock prices. Disney has recovered from much worse, such as The Black Cauldron, which was the pinnacle of a decade of substandard films sometimes referred to as The Dark Ages, hence The ""Renaissance"" Era which followed after. It took just 7 years for Disney to fully recover from that unfortunate chapter in their history. Frozen/RotG would be just one bad film coming after a mountain of success.  Edit: SGPFC"

Frozen,3cng56,AvatarBrony,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"Others insist media is justifying divorce and giving the impression that it is less harmful than it really is.   I don't think any of the Disney parents divorced though. Dead parents and divorce are two completely different things. I'm not sure if kids have the mind to just connect the two when watching a movie. In fact, I don't have the mind to do that. I don't know anybody who watches Elsa and Anna's parents drown and then say ""Huh, divorce doesn't seem so bad.""   Betzy Bozdech warns in an article for Common Sense Media that watching these movies can cause children sadness or introduce uncomfortable topics parents may need to discuss with them.   I think kids are happy to watch Disney films. Disney tends to leave you with happy feels by the time a movie ends. Honestly, these people underestimate the intelligence of children and seem way too disconnected from their childhood. It's actually kind of insulting.   “Scenes that deal with loss, separation, and kids and parents in peril are particularly unsettling, so be prepared to help them deal with the tough issues they see. It's best to answer kids' inevitable questions with direct, simple, and honest information, and reassure them where you can.”    Oh no! Disney may force you to talk about tough topics with your kids. Fuck you Disney, now you're forcing people to do parenting. That's not what couples sign up for when they get kids. Don't you know children shouldn't know there's problems in the world? I'm too lazy to read this person's article, but I'm hoping she's just making the point that you may need to discuss certain topics with kids rather than saying that's why Disney movies are bad.  Anyway, I think the biggest reason Disney princesses don't have parents is because they get in the way of the story. It's the same reason why a lot of characters in TV shows aren't close to their family. Writers don't wanna have to distract themselves with that shit."

Frozen,3cklpl,Demian_Dillers,7,Thu Jul 9 05:04:41 2015 UTC,Here you see Anna being a little self-centered shit.  Kristoff trying to be logical and reason with her and Elsa just fulfilling her caprices. This is why you don't trust the Arendelle royalty.
Frozen,3cklpl,Demian_Dillers,5,Wed Jul 8 17:48:27 2015 UTC,...What I saw was Kristoff being slightly terrified in the next to last frame when he realized that Elsa had been following them around.
Frozen,3cklpl,Demian_Dillers,5,Wed Jul 8 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"You're right. I guess it's kind of scary having your sister in law , who is also the Snow Queen. Stalk you and hear your conversations. Overly Attached Sister?, Elsa has some issues."
Frozen,3cklpl,PixelPharaoh,3,Wed Jul 8 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"Overprotective, sure.  I was thinking along the lines of her having a hard time trusting him around Anna at first after what Hans did.  Of course by Anna's 19th birthday (Frozen Fever) it seems she's come to trust him a lot more."
Frozen,3cklpl,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 8 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I can imagine that, considering that Kristoff is also kind of a loner, now known guy, not many people might have known details about him she could find out to be sure, his background might be blank. And if she did  know about he being raised by trolls, that probably wasn't as reassuring to her either. Either scenario, her trust in him after the events of Frozen could still be pretty challenged. As you said though, by Fever she seems to trust him way more, but it would be interesting to know more about that development and how Elsa viewed him entering their lives at first, she probably wasn't completely comfortable with him joining and being so close, considering her asocial nature and had a hard time becoming his friend and probably the same for him.  That or, Elsa just felt left out when the two of them became closer and stayed together and she just wants to fit in with the group so she's following them all the time at the opportunity to jump in and be awesome , like in this comic. Of course, they'll never set Elsa aside intentionally, so they'd be happy she joined, still kind of creepy though."
Frozen,3cklpl,PixelPharaoh,2,Thu Jul 9 00:20:56 2015 UTC,It would be interesting to see the sequel focus on something like this.
Frozen,3cklpl,somewhatgermaphobic,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah , perhaps not the sequel but a short right after the events of Frozen, could be pretty funny."
Frozen,3cklpl,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jul 9 06:25:28 2015 UTC,I love how nonchalant Elsa is being. Like it's just no big deal that she is seemingly following them around.
Frozen,3cklpl,Troubleshooter11,4,Wed Jul 8 18:36:01 2015 UTC,Poor Elsa is third-wheeling
Frozen,3cklpl,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jul 8 22:23:55 2015 UTC,I think Kristoff wouldn't mind if she wanted to be the third in the party though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This favouritism, among a slew of other minor offenses will become a point of contention among the denizens. However, because Queen Elsa is a snow queen, an uprising is unrecommended. Still, eventually word will get out about the public's discontent & Queen Elsa will be placed in the uncomfortable position of responding to the criticism.

Frozen,3cl2kw,XzodiaYinZero,3,Wed Jul 8 19:21:56 2015 UTC,The us military would be blackopsing the shit out of her to study her for weaponization.
Frozen,3cl2kw,creepycherry,2,Thu Jul 9 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"It somewhat depends on how Norway responds first. If the Norwegian military find her first, then they would detain her. If the winter ends, then they would probably have to let her go. She is the queen after all, and she would have a lot of support from her sister and her political allies. If they don't let her go, then it would be viewed as a power grab and could start a civil war. If the winter doesn't end, then they would probably conduct experiments on her. Foreign powers would see this as human rights violations and impose sanctions on Norway. The winter would probably get worse due to the emotional distress that the queen has been suffering due to the experiments and the world would empathize with her. Eventually it would cause World War III.  If the Norwegian government asks for foreign help, then the United Nations (really the United States) would take charge of finding the queen. If they find her, then they would send her to a secure facility and experiment on her/see if they can weaponize her ice powers. They would keep her regardless of if the winter ends or not.  The princess would demand that they release here sister and accuse them of human rights violations. The people of the world would rally behind her and protest the queen's detainment. The UN would be under so much pressure that they would have to release here."
Frozen,3cl2kw,Luimnigh,2,Wed Jul 8 21:17:56 2015 UTC,"Germany   dammit. But I would love to swap the summer for winter. Yes, I'm one of those gals. I guess it's also easier for me to keep myself warm than to keep the hot weather out of my apartment, so go ahead Elsa. Destroy our crops as long as you make the sun go away.      As for other people: Of course they would burn her as a witch. The question is how funny the looks on their faces would be if this wouldn't end the winter."
Frozen,3cl2kw,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jul 8 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"Well, you are not the only one preferring winter over summer. :P"
Frozen,3cl2kw,Theroonco,2,Wed Jul 8 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"The sudden onset of winter instantly ruins most of the crops and harvests in North-Western Europe.   We see at the end of the movie that the plant life was completely unaffected.  So, assuming that plant life is unaffected:  The world is surprised at the sudden snowstorm that came out of nowhere and grew to swell over most of Northern Europe. Meteorologists try to figure out what happened, to no avail.  No-one but the tabloids reports on the magical powers. Most people scoff at this conspiracy theory, but footage starts showing up on Youtube, to the point where it starts getting believable. Scientists start showing up on TV, trying to explain the phenomena going on in the videos.  Europe effectively shuts down under feet of snow. Billions are lost due to this whole fracas.  The movie plays out as it usually does, mainly because still nobody who didn't actually witness it believes it. Eventually we get to the climax and all the snow disappears in one moment.  The world gets really scared of the Queen of Norway, because this shit can't be explained."
Frozen,3cl2kw,dragongt1994,2,Wed Jul 8 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"You can expect some mass hysteria among the political world, especially within the superpowers.  Face it, the United States would be the first to act and likely quarantine her in a maximum security research installation in the vast deserts of Nevada. She could probably fight back any hostiles such as our infantry, tanks, aircraft, and establish a ""death zone"" encompassing the Scandinavian region, but once we start rolling in the heavy ordinance such as missiles she is a goner. This scenario will end up with her being studied in a genetics research facility for the advancement of the human race."
Frozen,3cl2kw,cyberdragon1,2,Wed Jul 8 22:37:12 2015 UTC,"All religions would go crazy, calling her Satan's wife or something. Others would have ""My life is a lie!"" moments and deeply religious people (such as my parents)...would not handle it well. At all.  Politically speaking, the UN would decide to put its ""nukes are bad"" rule to one side and fire all the A-bombs they'd built anyway at Norway.  Or beg Elsa on their hands and needs for support and blow Norway up if she refuses (Norway would need to make up for its ruined resources, so Elsa could have a lot of ""win-win"" alliances on her hands).  I would rejoice at finally having snow, though I may begin to worry if the snow doesn't go away soon. That said I'd take her side in the matter and be the first to say ""I liked her before it was coolI told you so"" when she's found and the rest of Frozen plays out as I'm sure quite a few of us will.  tl;dr: Everyone will take the Duke's side save those who don't immediately panic and realise Elsa as a human being with flaws."

Frozen,3cjjbi,XNinja2017,0,Wed Jul 8 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Strange that the artist included Prince Hans in the background. Some can claim his vile presence taints the focus of the shot, but they're in denial if they continue to believe his expression was fabricated to continue his ruse. He truly pities the Snow Queen."
Frozen,3cjjbi,AnonnyMiss,2,Wed Jul 8 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Some can claim his vile presence taints the focus of the shot   Really? Honestly, it makes the scene that much more powerful. This shot, and the subsequent shot are rather difficult to reconcile due to their vastly different dipections of the Prince. Yeah, I agree with you there. In this shot he appears to be expressing sympathy for the Queen, whereas in the next scene he is clearly expressing a face of accomplishment and pride. Rather interesting don't you think?"
Frozen,3cjjbi,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jul 8 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"I've given that scene further thought. The film only shows Prince Han's expression in two shots between the moment Princess Anna spots Prince Hans & Snow Queen Elsa on the fjord & when Snow Queen Elsa lifts the snow. In both shots, Prince Hans had an intense expression & was bringing down his sword. Some fans interpret his expression as bloodlust, while Prince Hans sympathizers claim his grin was about how this final action would have secured him the throne. Now I believe neither are true. Prince Hans's scrunched-up face was a physical response to his body exerting all his might into one part. We see photographs of athletes dunking a basketball or slugging a homer with nasty mugs all the time. Remember during the 2012 London Olympics when folks on the Internet would photoshop divers over toilets or rockets? That."

Frozen,3cksmf,ArendelleKnight,2,Wed Jul 8 21:45:10 2015 UTC,"I don't even get why there are still people out there who don't see it as canon. It might be an easter egg but they were clearly in front of the gate. It wasn't just a subtle painting in the background, a statue, a name on a book or whatever. There were both of them fully animated between the crowd. The actual characters. It can't get more canon than this. This is too much to call it just a gag. If they really know each other etc. is not clear, but it's definitely the same universe."
Frozen,3cksmf,creepycherry,3,Wed Jul 8 22:44:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Whether it was ""just an easter egg"" or the filmmakers took the time to actually consider where Corona fits into the world of Frozen doesn't matter, either way they were there at Elsa's coronation, so they do exist in that universe."
Frozen,3cksmf,ArendelleKnight,2,Wed Jul 8 23:24:09 2015 UTC,"Because Disney always does that. They put characters and objects for fun. Belle, Pumba, the Carpet etc... in The HunchBack of Notre Dame, Hans in BH6, Scar in Hercules , etc... they are always just easter eggs so people can recognize and look for interesting stuff into the film. They have always been treated as such, why would the tangled ones be any different?. The directors of Tangled and Frozen are different anyway.  Easter eggs are normal in pop culture and they are always just fun stuff to recognize, that happens in films, videogames, series and whatnot, I don't see why we need to overthink them in the case of Frozen."

Frozen,3cksmf,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Normally I would stick with what I said, especially because Disney is one of the few companies which definitely don't need the same director to make anything within their movies canon and what /u/karpfenschleuder wrote also summed up the essence of my first post very well. But I read the rest of your dialogue and if it's true that it doesn't take place during the same timeline then I have to take back what I said, because then it wouldn't make much sense.      . I was also told by a certain person who I totally didn't mention in one of the sentences above, that I should answer your post to admit that you're probably right ._. *blushes*"
Frozen,3cksmf,creepycherry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I didn't intend to be ""right"", at least  was not the purpose of my post, but I do appreciate your recognition :3. More like I just wanted to explain why I (and others) just don't see an easter egg like that as a confirmation that they take place on the same world. You're right, Disney doesn't need the same directors, but if there's no official word from Disney the new directors themselves just make allusions to others rather than use their work.   But in any case, You might be interested in this and this one the author is rather blunt, but explains pretty well why they are evidently set in different times of cultural development therefore they both are positioned hundreds of years apart in time settings. Wouldn't make sense that Corona is so behind after all specially considering the continent seems pretty uniform during the coronation."
Frozen,3cksmf,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"Excuse me but I just stalked the Reddit activities of someone and saw this thread. As an indie animator and game developer I think that's an interesting topic so I want to give it a try. Of course without a fixed conclusion. Just a train of thought.      Movies are an art form and therefore deserve that their creators treat them respectfully like that. So personally I'd say you can't throw everything into your work and then claim that none of it really exists. An easter egg should be a subtle reference and it is in most of the cases, because most content creators understand that it shouldn't be more than that. That's why the majority of directors wouldn't place a full-sized ufo in the background of a medieval movie. It would put the audience off. They would hide it as a pattern on a stone for example (Steven Spielberg did that when he placed R2D2 and C3PO on a pillar in ""Raiders of the lost ark"").      Scar in Hercules was nothing else than a fur on the ground that had his design. Of course it wasn't supposed to be his corpse. It was just an object that looked like him. Hans in Big Hero 6 was a little picture in the background and a statue. As far as I know there was no Hans in the movie. Only things that reminded of him. Because that's the purpose of a good easter egg. It reminds you of something you might know. It's a reference to something else. As soon as you put an entirely animated actual character of another work completely alive into your world, you cross a thin line. Because that's neither subtle nor a reference anymore. It's the actual figure themself who suddenly walks around in your world (maybe even in front of your current main character) and that's not as common as it sounds.      The janitor in ""Scream"" for example wore the hat and the sweater of Freddy Krueger and his name was Fred. That's one clever way to place an existing figure into your work. Wes Craven knew that it wouldn't make any sense to place the actual main character of one of his former movies into the environment of his current one. If he would've done it then he would've canonized it by accident and that's the same what Disney does when they let their characters walk around in different movies. That makes sense within the Marvel or DC universe for example because it is in fact always the same universe. But as soon as you do it for the sake of an easter egg then you need to do it subtle. Otherwise there are only two options left. Either it's an unintentional admission and therefore canon now or you can brush it off as a movie mistake, which it isn't because it was on purpose, so it's poorly executed at best.    Considering these two options you can now take a look at what makes the most sense in any particular case. Because an easter egg can of course take place in the same universe and it can also still be nothing else than an easteregg. It can be both (for example when Clark Kent walks around in the background of a shopping mall in Gotham City). Belle in Paris would make sense since both stories take place in France. But they're probably 100 years apart. So you can't canonize the universe idea afterwards and therefore it can't be more than just an absurd gag. It's random and so it does make as much sense as talking gargoyles. So it's clear that someone didn't know how to place a subtle reference and therefore it's poorly executed in my eyes (only as an easter egg of course - it's still nice to spot).      Right now I don't know enough about the timelines of Frozen and Tangled. I read somewhere that it's the same timeline and that a crossover would at least make sense in a historical way. I think it's clear that it was meant to be a gag in the first place (so you're right) but to save it from the aftertaste of a ""not so well executed easter egg"" it can always be an option to look if it could at least really take place in the same universe or if it's just a random appearance that doesn't make any sense at all. I would say in the case of Frozen and Tangled it's at least an option to call it canon as long as it's just for the universe part and doesn't go beyond it. It just shouldn't go as far as to say that the characters are related in any way or know of each other. Because that's of course just a speculation and can't be said without adding more content first. But the consequently conclusion that they at least live in the same world is something I personally would support.      I hope these thoughts made any sense to you. :)"

Frozen,3cksmf,Karpfenschleuder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"I understand that and it's not the only time I've read something like that. However characters walking out in pop culture is actually pretty common. Clark Kent appears in Marvel comics, Anime reference other anime all the time with chars walking by, videogames have you find out of place characters all the time, like Zergs in WCIII. But that hardly makes them hard canon, these are just hidden and fun facts to enjoy and not taken seriously. Given Rapunzel and Flynn do not have any spoken line, are only seen from their backs and appear less than 2 seconds it's subtle enough to see it as a cool reference with 2 chars resembling them.  Tangled is also based on 1600 while Frozen is based on 1800. There was a user in tumblr who made a post explaining the cultural differences given the timelines and how apart they both are, over 200 years. It's just that ""old europe"" seems to be taken popularly as if it was all the same for over 500 years. While both are alternative worlds and of course do not fit on out historical timelines, the inspiration and cultural differences would place them in very different centuries of development.  Easter eggs can only be canonized IMO if both the reference and the story are from the same author/developer. Frozen and Tangled are not, even if they are from the same company."
Frozen,3cksmf,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"However characters walking out in pop culture is actually pretty common.     It happens often but in relation to the large spectrum of easter eggs and background gags as a whole, it's only a small footnote. That has its reason because it's actually the laziest form of an easter egg and doesn't need much creativity to think it out.       Clark Kent appears in Marvel comics   Yes, but those are official crossovers and no easter eggs. It's a sort of parallel universe (see below).       Given Rapunzel and Flynn do not have any spoken line, are only seen from their backs and appear less than 2 seconds it's subtle enough to see it as a cool reference with 2 chars resembling them.   I think you misunderstood what I meant by ""subtle"". Yes, the appearance itself is subtle for the eye of the audience as they don't spot it immediately, but that doesn't make it a subtle easter egg and it still makes it a full appearance of the complete character itself. That's more of a cameo.       Easter eggs can only be canonized IMO if both the reference and the story are from the same author/developer.       That heavily depends on the interpretation and the view (but don't worry, I saw your IMO). Technically it only needs one person for a certain form of canonizing. If I create an entire universe, then take a well known aspect or object of another universe and place it in mine, I can make it canon any time that the certain something is also part of it. The original creator can claim that my characters / objects are not a part of the universe he created, but that my characters run into his creation within my universe would still be canon. Both worlds would exist simultaneously and be parallel universes. Once created they would also conceptually stay this way, even if the other creator would sue me in the real world and would force me to take everything down. That wouldn't affect the existence of the concept of my universe.        Now what does this mean for Tangled and Frozen? If you're right that they don't play in the same century then it means most likely nothing. It could technically be a parallel universe, created by a staff member that worked on both projects for example, but in reality it's probably just a random cameo without any importance at all."

No no, I mean actual easter eggs xD, you can see Clark in absolutely random comics of marvel walking by or looking trough  a window or something. Nothing to do with the official crossovers.

That's more of a cameo.    I understood what you mean, but I don't see difference between objects, references and the minimal presence of characters. So something most barely notice unless they are pointed out and even looking for it miss it like Eugene and Rapunzel in Frozen, seems subtle enough to blend without problems. That's pretty difference than  let's say Stan Lee's apparitions in the MCU, and they are hardly  canon as the ""same guy"".

That wouldn't affect the existence of the concept of my universe.    You enter fanfiction/adaptation field right there, like OUAT that used the Frozen characters having Frozen canon to it but not being canon to Frozen. Sure, that works and Disney gave permission for it to be an AU, but it's not always the case and at times it's outright copy/inspiration or fanwork. Still that's a big field to discuss but easter eggs usually don't need that due their small just for fun deliverings."
Frozen,3cksmf,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jul 9 22:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with this idea. I really like all these connected universes. As long as they keep doing whatever worlds they want and make them connect with each other in meaningful ways, then it's all for the best."

Frozen,3ci7ic,LastUniqueUserID,0,Wed Jul 8 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"The message could have been stronger if Snow Queen Elsa was a wicked villainess. A sacrifice of life would be greater if the person the sacrifice is for does not seem worthy of the sacrifice. In the final cut, there is little doubt to Princess Anna's sacrifice- who wouldn't die for somebody as wonderful as Queen Elsa? Rather, the sacrifice should be stunning & have the audience asking ""Why did Princess Anna sacrifice her life for her? What did Snow Queen Elsa ever do for Princess Anna?"""
Frozen,3ci7ic,AnonnyMiss,3,Wed Jul 8 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"She did develop a shroud of antagonism around herself though, both serving as an impediment to Anna's journey and a source of cataclysm for the people of Arendelle. Also, Let it Go in certain interpretations can further induce those feelings within the audience. However, keep in mind that Anna sacrificed herself for her own sister. Even after she shut her out for so long without an answer, and continued to repel her love after her revelation, she still loved her sincerely.  In regards to what Elsa did for Anna, she isolated herself and endured literal hell for her sister for thirteen years. She essentially threw away her entire life just to protect her sister."

Frozen,3ci7ic,Portgas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"Is it unconditional,  though? It's a sisterly love, not a total love for some random stranger. Anna caring about Elsa is a condition enough, I think."

Frozen,3ci7ic,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"It is - ""condtions"" - ""rules"" - ""expectations"". They're largely synonymous.   The love you would feel for a spouse could never be unconditional, for instance, because you expect to feel that same love back. You need something back from them.  Love for family is unconditional - you love them despite who they are or what they do(well, most of the time). You can't expect them to always be there for you, or always please you. It's not their job to. But they ARE your family.  To love a stranger would be considered charitable love."

Frozen,3ci7ic,creepycherry,3,Wed Jul 8 18:42:20 2015 UTC,I think you're missing something. She was actually convinced that Kristoff's kiss could save her and then decided against her own rescue in the very last moment to save her sister instead.

Frozen,3ci7ic,XNinja2017,7,Wed Jul 8 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"I look at it differently that you do.  I always felt like Anna knew what love was, at least when she was the one giving love.  It seemed to me that she didn't understand what it felt like to be on the receiving end of love, especially where Elsa was concerned.  Even though Elsa loved her very much, and had given up a her childhood to protect Anna."
Frozen,3ci7ic,AvatarBrony,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, here are some points I want to further address.   I always felt like Anna knew what love was, at least when she was the one giving love.   Anna's view on love was predominately romanticized and rather naive in general to be honest. Yeah, we saw how she really felt about Elsa in Do You Want To Build A Snowman? and to some degree the reprise, but we didn't really see Anna display anything substantial until the very end when she experienced her sudden transition on love.    It seemed to me that she didn't understand what it felt like to be on the receiving end of love, especially where Elsa was concerned. Even though Elsa loved her very much, and had given up a her childhood to protect Anna.   You are right on that first statement, since the plot had her resolve that aspect of her's at the end. That was the conflict with Anna. The second statement however is partially true. Finding equilibrium in each of the sisters' methods of displaying love for the other as seen in the film is actually a futile effort honestly. Yeah, Anna sacrificed herself for her sister, but that was an event over a span of a few seconds. Elsa on the other hand imposed self-isolation upon herself for thirteen years in an attempt to protect her sister from her dangerous powers. Both just don't compare really.  Also, yes, I likely just incited an Anna vs Elsa debate...."

Elsa on the other hand imposed self-isolation upon herself for thirteen years in an attempt to protect her sister from her dangerous powers. Both just don't compare really.   I don't think the movie is trying to compare dick sizes in which sister sacrificed more than the other. Both sisters obviously care about each other a lot. That being said, the movie's theme of love vs. fear points to Elsa's self-isolation as the wrong course of action and is based too much on fear. Love is supposed to be an open door, but she kept the door shut on Anna. By the end of the movie, Elsa had to open up the gates and let her sister back into her life instead of staying isolated, and it was Anna's sacrifice that led her to be able to do that."

Frozen,3ci7ic,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:14 2015 UTC,? The only thing in the ending that really bugged me (beside the hans twist) was how Elsa suddenly got 'full control' of her powers. She was all like 'love...love of course'. It was too easy. They should have made it look like an accident.

Frozen,3ci7ic,dragongt1994,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:38:31 2015 UTC,"Frozen didn't have a happy ending just for the sake of having one. There was definitely a theme and message that fueled the plot and the final resolution. The story was about love vs. fear. Elsa, although she isolated herself because she loved her sister, was still acting on fear. Fear is also what causes her to lose control of her powers. The quality of her emotions is what determines how much she has.  In the end, Anna's heart thawed from an act of true love. Elsa finally gained control of her powers and learned how to thaw ice and snow because she learned that love is what she needed in order to do so. It wasn't easy at all for Elsa to learn what love does for her powers. It was a very emotional journey throughout her childhood to the present day to then seeing her sister sacrifice her life. Having Anna die and Elsa stay isolated, to me, would be Disney being dark just for the sake of being dark.  You did just inspire me to make a post that details how Elsa's powers are affected by her emotions though. When I have time, I'll get to doing that."
Frozen,3ci7ic,AvatarBrony,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:10 2015 UTC,The Elsa's setup seems to me a person whos problem would requires years of therapy. Elsa suddenly getting over it and apparently can now control it doesn't seem natural
Frozen,3ci7ic,masklinn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Elsa has always had love in her life because she loves her sister and vice versa. Throughout Elsa's childhood she tried to figure out how to control her powers and never knew how to thaw her magic, but seeing Anna's act of true love thaw her own heart, it should be natural for Elsa to come to her conclusion. The act of true love kind of has an opposite effect of how a traumatic experience changes someone's life.   I dunno dude, but if Elsa can't see that love thaws her magic when it comes at her in such a blatant obvious manner, that would make her kinda dumb. The reason it takes people with Elsa's problems years is because they can't literally see the answer to their problems in magical form. Why should we expect a natural healing process when such an unnatural magical phenomenon just occurred? Elsa's problem doesn't need to be resolved true to life in our world. Her issues need to be fixed in a way that makes sense in the story, and I think it does in the world of Frozen. That's why Elsa healing more quickly is believable and she can still be very relatable to people like her.  Maybe if Elsa and Anna stopped caring about each other a long time ago and Elsa never saw an act of true love, then it would make sense to take years or just never recover."
Frozen,3ci7ic,dragongt1994,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"I thought that for way more than just the ending, many transitions were abrupt and there were plenty of sequences which would have benefited from more development. And I definitely kept thinking it would have benefited from being a series rather than a 100mn movie. Brevity may be the soul of wit, but there's a point at which you're throwing half the meat into the trash."

Frozen,3cj3sy,LastUniqueUserID,2,Wed Jul 8 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Usually only extremely talented, very highly trained, and very practiced vocalists will be able to get even close to a semblance of ""perfect"" when singing more demanding songs live in one take...and from a vocals perspective, Let It Go is pretty darned demanding. I don't envy Idina Menzel. Too bad she didn't get Anna's songs instead...not that they're super simple or anything like that, but Let It Go seems like it's on an entirely different level from them in terms of how demanding the vocals are, IMO.  Most artists being unable to perform their vocals like their studio recordings is actually usually why I don't like live recordings/performances...but that's because I'm bit of an extreme misophonia...ist, and hearing vocal-work that sounds even a little bit off from how I'm used to it drives me crazy. But that's just a personal thing, and it's not like I expect artists to magically become perfect or anything silly like that."

Know who would go to any lengths to help a girl he loves, or at least one he likes? Kristoff. He sure wasn't staying around Anna then.  See, when they both figure out how horrible Anna is, they will simultaneously discover how much they prefer eachother.  All hands on deck! The S.S. Kristelsa is setting sail!"
Frozen,3ch3xt,Schadenfreudenous,2,Tue Jul 7 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. After all Anna never returned Kristoff's gestures at fever, she clearly just wants to play with him!. Kristoff worked along Elsa to make a great celebration, listened to her and then helped her snowmen, they clearly have more room to work on together rather than follow Anna's lunacy and thirst of control over them both!.  Kristoff and Elsa might get together after all when they realize how much better they are together, if Anna doesn't destroy them first."
Frozen,3ch3xt,Zarith7480,3,Tue Jul 7 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Haha! Board the ship, lad!  /u/Theroonco, prepare for me to slip little hints or jokes at Kristelsa into ""The Strike War"". For Schaden is a shipper. Mostly when drunk. But still.  Eh, likely I'll have a little joke or quip every once in a while. Unless you wanna go the whole nine yards, and dedicate this glorious story to Kristelsa.  On a serious note, I'm writing now, but don't know if I'll finish tonight. Trying to write Anna and Kristoff is hard - I can never be sure exactly how characters will act if I haven't created them myself. So I re-watched the movie, trying to peg down their mannerisms.   No offense, but it's sort of what you did with Zarith earlier. He...wouldn't scream like that. He would be resentful and grumpy, but he's just not a loud guy. He's also not a hateful guy.   Eh, I don't like correcting people. Makes me feel bad. You can leave it as is, if you want. Or I can send you my version of how that exchange would go down. I don't blame you at all - I would probably do the same thing with one of your characters. I'm just bad at writing for a personality I haven't created myself.  EDIT: Ignore most of this, Demian. I'm just assuming the summoning system works and Theroonco will show up."
Frozen,3ch3xt,CarterDug,2,Tue Jul 7 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"I felt he would be caught up in the heat of the moment (pun unintended) and would be a well mannered, if a little grumpy, person once he had the chance to calm down. I should have made that clearer, I know. If you think that sounds right, I'm glad. If not, I'd like to see what you think he'd say :)  Also, /u/TheHappyJammer wrote a small addition to the story here. It doesn't affect your plot, but I thought you ought to know :)"

I can never be sure exactly how characters will act if I haven't created them myself. So I re-watched the movie, trying to peg down their mannerisms.    This right here is actually everyone's problem, unless you created said character I can hardly believe you can truly express it good, maybe ""good enough"" but certainly not in the true way said character would work on different situations.

Frozen,3ch3xt,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:28 2015 UTC,"Mmm. I've created plenty of original universes and stories, and continue to develop those.  I just also enjoy creating an original character and sticking them into a pre-existing universe, and then imagining how things would go down, how the other characters would react. Usually not a self-insert, just a character I know the mind of. Self-inserts are boring, as they usually turn out as Mary Sue characters.  My most extreme case of original character creation happened for RWBY - I think I'm racking up around 30 characters and 3-5 original storylines that I've created to exist within the universe of that show. Nearly all the storylines have nothing to do with the characters and story of the original show, and merely use the universe(which I find incredibly cool).  If you're interested in RWBY, here are the first four trailers:  Red  White  Black  Yellow  Note - the voice acting in the actual show is not terrible. These were just very early pre-recordings - practice, really. Voices in the actual show are pretty damn good."
Frozen,3ch3xt,XNinja2017,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:20 2015 UTC,"Self inserts are terrible in many many levels that is true.  I create mostly stories of my own, although I use myths and legends that actually were part of our world, like Greek mythology or the Arthurian legends and fairytales, I don't exactly consider them using other people's characters as much as using parts of our world. Perhaps the stories I've created for my WoW characters in a form of roleplay would count  as inserting characters into a pre-stablished world. My most extreme case of using other people's intellectual property though, would be creating entire seasons of Digimon. Of course with a complete new human rooster, a different way for the digimon to work (like every season of digi) and whatnot, but still.  As for RWBY you're not the first one recommending me it, even here the first one was ArendelleKnight, I might watch it some day if I see that I have time to invest in a new series."

Frozen,3ce7p2,Theroonco,2,Tue Jul 7 05:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Edna ""blessed"" her most damaged (loyal?) follower, Brennen, with magic to give to those he deemed fit or gifted all three(+) of them herself. I also think Sol is Rapunzel's sister who's staying away to protect her. Why else would she live on the outskirts of town (granted you could expect word to leak out eventually, however secretive she wanted to be).  And her being relevant against the threat of shadow magic makes sense: light vs dark, with ice in the middle both literally and figuratively.  Also, this is totally what Brennen summoned."
Frozen,3cdq39,Demian_Dillers,4,Tue Jul 7 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"What would happen with the relationships once this is discovered?   I think it would put a little bit of a strain on everyone's relationship for a short time, but eventually everyone would get over it.   Would it have repercussions on the current lives of the characters?   Short term - maybe.  Long term - I doubt it.   Would Anna and Elsa think different of their parents?   I think they would, but they'd probably try to somehow justify it in their minds.  They'd probably wouldn't want to accept that their parents could do such a terrible thing.   Would this be too dark for Frozen?   I don't think so, but Disney might.   Should I stop eating weird candies and then creating this kind of stuff?   No.  It keeps things interesting for everyone else!"
Frozen,3cdq39,LastUniqueUserID,3,Tue Jul 7 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"I think it would put a little bit of a strain on everyone's relationship for a short time, but eventually everyone would get over it.   Would be pretty sad for all of them though. However I'm sure Kristoff would forgive them, they knew or did nothing and he is more logical than emotional.   I think they would, but they'd probably try to somehow justify it in their minds. They'd probably wouldn't want to accept that their parents could do such a terrible thing.   Specially Anna, Elsa might kind of recent them.   No. It keeps things interesting for everyone else!   Good! I shouldn't stop taking my medication anyway..."
Frozen,3cdq39,x727x,2,Tue Jul 7 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Kristoff's and Anna's relationship would completely break due to Kristoff not being able to cope with the fact that Anna's family killed his parents. Of course Elsa and Anna are both devastated once they learn that their parents killed two people in cold blood.   Now that Kristoff has broken off all contact with the two sisters, Elsa and Anna don't have anyone else who they can talk to about the horrible revelation, except each other. Along with this new found pain Elsa also has to help Anna deal with the emotional backlash of Kristoff breaking up with her. After a long journey full of emotions and talks of lost love, Elsa and Anna make a bond so strong that it borders on unhealthy. Eventually this new found dependence the sisters have with each other turns into a heated and unsteady romance. Elsanna IS OTP!!!  ...damn, now i want to write a fanfic about this  ~Cheers"

Particularly of fantasy, mystery, and political subjects, but I can't help thinking of romance every once in a while.  The process of Kristoff and Elsa finding their way together is just too interesting a subject to ignore. Much more interesting than the constant incest that plagues this community. It completely ignores the familial love part of the movie, in my opinion."

Frozen,3cbe0t,Portgas,3,Mon Jul 6 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"If this game is anything like the first one, I wouldn't expect too much from the game. You're more or less just running errands for Disney characters. I've heard people call it animal crossing with Disney characters, but that's not it at all. If this releases outside Japan and anyone here is interested, make sure you watch videos and whatnot to see if you're still interested. The Frozen scenario will probably be a half hour long before you're finding honey for pooh bear, so don't just buy it for that."

Frozen,3ca8xi,ricANNArdo,12,Mon Jul 6 09:16:18 2015 UTC,"""I want an Elsa with dark skin.""   Because Norway is known for it's black people. Sidenote: 30.7% of Disney Princesses are people of colour. 22.3% of Americans are people of colour. Disney already has a damn good POC record.   ""I want a more realistic relationship between Elsa and her sibling.""   Except Elsa and Anna's relationship is based on those of Disney staff. Saying it's not realistic is a lie.   ""I want more scenes where Elsa learns to control her powers.""   That's what the sequel is for.   ""I want scenes that prove Elsa's a feminist icon.""   So you want to make everything heavy-handed and blunt? You want everything laid out for you, no subtlety or symbolism? You want every female character to be fighting the forces of sexism?  I hope to crap whoever says that never writes anything more than fanfiction.   Edit: Misspelled ""what""."

Frozen,3ca8xi,dragongt1994,14,Mon Jul 6 11:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry guys. But to cheer you up, here's the cheer-up comments from the other post:     What if you want a Katara that sings really well at inappropriate times?      You just think you have an answer for everything, huh? What if I want an Elsa that constantly talks about hope and gets all emotional? What then?      I see Elsa compared to waterbenders a lot. And while I love the Avatar franchise, Elsa's powers go way, way beyond anything that we see from waterbenders. Elsa brought Olaf to life without even really meaning to (and later, Marshmallow, purposefully). She made an enormous ice palace out of thin air. Waterbenders need a source, and even Korra was unable to grab enough water to get out of the probending arena.  It's like when people discussed who would win in a fight between Toph and Magneto. Because metalbending. Now, I love Toph, but her abilities don't even compare to Magneto's control over magnetism.      Am I the only one who thinks comparing Katara to Elsa at all is really fucking stupid?     Now, what things that Elsa has, that doesn't have on Katara?  Edit: pls don't hurt me I just crossposting posts that is relevant to Frozen."

Frozen,3ca8xi,BartyMae,11,Mon Jul 6 11:10:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is, quite frankly, a pretty stupid and unfair comparison. Obviously, the depth of Elsa's character will be hard to match with Katara's...that's the unfortunate consequence of comparing a character that is part of an actual multi-season show that lasts for 61 episodes * ~23 minutes for about a total of about 23.38 hours...vs a character in a movie that's only 1.7 hours long. Elsa also barely has any screen time...but to be fair, I'm sure Katara, as one of a half-dozen main characters or so, only has a relatively small portion for the entire series, too. Nevertheless, it's a pretty big stinking difference.  Furthermore...they're pretty different characters. Why are we really comparing them to begin with at all? I like Katara, but I love Anna and Elsa. Not being as strongly fleshed out as Katara might actually play a part of that: I don't know. Regardless, I think it's kind of a silly comparison given the circumstances. I identify more with Anna and Elsa and their issues than I do with Katara and hers...for me, Frozen is more of an emotional journey that happens to also be an adventure. Avatar is more of a grand adventure first...and then it also has a bunch of meaningful as well as emotional parts that make the adventure and the characters taking that journey worth watching and caring about. Similar, yes...but different. I don't really understand the Elsa/Katara comparison, because their personalities and personal struggles are pretty vastly different in pretty much every way...and very obviously so. So why make it?"

Frozen,3ca0uy,JamesAQuintero,6,Mon Jul 6 07:16:50 2015 UTC,"There's definitely more liveliness in the film version! In the not-in-film version, it doesn't really seem like she cares."
Frozen,3ca0uy,dragongt1994,3,Mon Jul 6 08:19:59 2015 UTC,I think the film version is a little more expressive. When she was sad at the beginning I think her eyes were lower. When she was talking about the engagement she was smiling a little more.

You could always try your hand at a Joker story. Every good Batman writer wants to go for a Joker story.  There's also a Mr. Freeze story. Maybe switch it around, with Anna showing up completely frozen, and Elsa playing the part of Freeze? She could have a pseudo-antagonistic role, moving between good and evil(?), trying to save Anna while also compromising with Batman.

They need Democracy and quick, also worth noting the ice creature she made to protect her in her fortress of solitude nearly killed her own sister because it got a little bit mad, she clearly has no control over them and they don't truly care about her will."

Frozen,3c3zet,gazza3478,4,Sat Jul 4 15:31:41 2015 UTC,Anna with a french accent? wipes forehead  Anyway I can't wait to see this for myself in just under 4 weeks! Now should I wear my Oaken jumper? :)
Frozen,3c3zet,Portgas,2,Sat Jul 4 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"Giant Olaf is always amusing/weird.  Man, I'd love to attend some of these sing-alongs one day."
Frozen,3c3zet,Portgas,2,Sat Jul 4 17:55:02 2015 UTC,what did you think of the Anna & Elsa in the video?
Frozen,3c3zet,Sylra,2,Sat Jul 4 18:21:13 2015 UTC,Pretty nice from what I've seen and heard.
Frozen,3c3zet,Sylra,2,Sat Jul 4 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, someone advertising this ! I overwatched those videos and, as someone living in France, the french version also, like I said on one of my comments on this account, I never considered to go to Disneyland before I saw Frozen, but now, and the summer events, well ...  And oh, I'm living 45 minutes of Paris RER from Disneyland."
Frozen,3c3zet,Sylra,3,Sat Jul 4 23:21:38 2015 UTC,I'm going myself in 3 weeks and 5 days! Not that I'm counting or anything…  And you only live 45 minutes away? I'm kind've jealous :)
Frozen,3c3zet,Sylra,2,Sat Jul 4 23:26:15 2015 UTC,Yeah and still I didn't go to Disneyland Paris in my life yet (except one time when I was little so I don't remember)
Frozen,3c3zet,Sylra,3,Sat Jul 4 23:57:02 2015 UTC,You should do something about that!
Frozen,3c2z4i,damocles2501,4,Sat Jul 4 07:08:28 2015 UTC,Huh. Oaken too.  What is Elsa reciting?
Frozen,3c2z4i,Theroonco,6,Sat Jul 4 08:24:25 2015 UTC,Seems like Norwegian lyrics of Let It Go to me.
Frozen,3c2z4i,paspartuu,4,Sat Jul 4 12:49:24 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be some legal scripture she'd memorised, but that works too :)"
Frozen,3c2z4i,Theroonco,2,Sat Jul 4 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"That drunk Hans is pretty damn great, I tell you what."
Frozen,3c2z4i,Dead5pidrIn99Seconds,3,Sat Jul 4 08:38:20 2015 UTC,This seems highly accurate.
Frozen,3c2z4i,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jul 4 07:31:33 2015 UTC,The facial expressions are fantastic
Frozen,3c2z4i,Portgas,2,Sat Jul 4 10:21:03 2015 UTC,Ayy Parks and Rec reference!
Frozen,3c312f,damocles2501,2,Sat Jul 4 07:36:00 2015 UTC,tumblr rehost
Frozen,3c34nm,Theroonco,5,Sat Jul 4 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't know much about these characters, but Elsa is a pretty damn formidable foe if she is out of character. I am sure they would destroy normal Elsa. Wank!Elsa could probably kill them all with ease based on what I do know lol.  Also, the genie from Aladdin can definitely do it. He is probably one of the highest tier Disney characters."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jul 4 10:36:23 2015 UTC,"Well, Genie is immortal, invincible, and beyond powerful. Capable of reworking reality as he sees fit, his only weakness is the fact that he plays slave to the possessor of his Lamp, a weakness removed by Aladdin. It would be a fool's errand to challenge a being whose powers are equal to, if not greater than, those of the most ancient gods.  He may not kill you, but he could absolutely send you back to the ancient past to serve as an entrée to a T-Rex, or to the far future when the Earth is a blasted husk devoid of life."
Frozen,3c34nm,Superjoshe,2,Sat Jul 4 12:02:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's invincible. Powerful? Yes, but what is the largest scale that we have seen his reality manipulation operate within? His power certainly isn't universal, and AFAIK it tends to cap out at city level, but it's still quite impressive indeed. Things like conceptual entities can still beat him, as well as other toonforce users like Bugs Bunny. There are a lot of things that can beat him out there.  In this case, Genie stomps worthy of a Vlad Tepes award. No one there as any countermeasure whatsoever to reality hax."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,2,Sat Jul 4 12:42:34 2015 UTC,"He says himself that he has ""PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER!!!""  Just with an itty-bitty living space."
Frozen,3c34nm,Superjoshe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"That's a rather ambiguous quote, especially considering the fact that we have never seen him display anything beyond city-level. I would like some more context to this quote because the way I am interpreting it at the moment doesn't seem to imply what you think it means.   He is stating that he possesses phenomenal power yes, but that power is confined to a small finite pocket universe. I did some investigation on him and apparantly his greatest feat in terms of scale was affecting the entire palace of Agrabah. Until there is a concrete feat that his power is indeed universal, this is nothing more than hyperbole.  If you want an example of cosmic reality manipulation, check out the Time Lords or the Q Continuum. The Time Lords destroy entities that outclass the Genie by several orders of magnitude regularly, and the Q can alter reality through thought alone. Even the Transcendence from the Xeelee Sequence novels can outclass the Genie and they are considerably lower than the aforementioned entities."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,2,Sat Jul 4 16:58:56 2015 UTC,I think we're getting pretty far afield from the original topic.  Suffice to say that Genie is leagues above the Avengers and could end them with little effort.
Frozen,3c34nm,Superjoshe,2,Sat Jul 4 22:55:46 2015 UTC,This sums up the fight pretty well.
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,2,Sat Jul 4 23:46:07 2015 UTC,I'll agree to that wholeheartedly.
Frozen,3c34nm,Superjoshe,3,Sun Jul 5 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"In-character Elsa couldn't.  Bloodlusted Elsa however, could do it with ease."
Frozen,3c34nm,Eriflee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Bloodlusted Elsa is scary dude, but the Avengers shouldn't be completely outclassed. Wank!Elsa on the other hand is overkill to such a ludicrous degree it's not even funny."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,2,Sat Jul 4 17:14:50 2015 UTC,"Look, I love Frozen. But saying Elsa could single handedly defeat all the Avengers? That's silly."
Frozen,3c34nm,WhenCornAttacks,2,Sat Jul 4 15:19:25 2015 UTC,I guess they totally underestimated the Avengers....
Frozen,3c34nm,potato-table,2,Sun Jul 5 00:41:06 2015 UTC,Possible if you make Elsa angry....you won't like elsa when she's angry
Frozen,3c34nm,dragongt1994,2,Sun Jul 5 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think the article mentioned that Elsa can also create snow monsters. Blizzards combined with armies of Marshmallows plus herself could definitely take out the Avengers, at least in a vacuum. Obviously, with her personality, the Avengers would have to do something like kill Anna to summon that type of wrath from Elsa."
Frozen,3c34nm,AvatarBrony,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:29:05 2015 UTC,"Elsa only stands a chance out of context character wise. Yeah, she could try to go Von Neumann with her snow minions, but the Avengers are going to be slaughtering them in the hundreds entirely unimpeded. There is only so much they can do. Yeah, Elsa possesses some impressive ""industrial"" feats, but the Avengers are going to be eliminating them faster than she can conjure them."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jul 5 05:42:22 2015 UTC,"Elsa: Nope. Any of the Avengers is prepared to use lethal force in a battle. Besides, Thor can use lightning. What is ice against electricity?"
Frozen,3c34nm,Portgas,3,Sat Jul 4 09:53:05 2015 UTC,What if she strikes first? And her ice could be reinforced~
Frozen,3c34nm,Portgas,3,Sat Jul 4 10:05:20 2015 UTC,Thor is a god and he fought against ice titans on an ice planet. He has it covered.
Frozen,3c34nm,creepycherry,3,Sat Jul 4 10:16:03 2015 UTC,Good point. Her magic could help: Thor claimed his was just science.
Frozen,3c34nm,gazza3478,3,Sat Jul 4 10:20:22 2015 UTC,He's a guy. She would probably just need to freeze his balls.
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:03:20 2015 UTC,God damn blue balls...
Frozen,3c34nm,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jul 4 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"Elsa can't beat them in any way. In fact, this is a total stomp. However, pull her out of character and give her high-end interpretations and things start getting interesting.  Wank!Elsa would likely outright destroy them though."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"Actually Ice/Cold has quite a number of advantages against electricity, I'd say they they are pretty balanced.  I'm  not saying Elsa beats Thor, Thor is a warrior god :P, I'm talking about the elements."
Frozen,3c34nm,HeimrArnadalr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"Thick enough sheets of ice can behave like electrical inhibitors. However, that's actually irrelevant as her ice is able to withstand velocities many times above those experienced by space shuttles as they re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Lightning isn't getting past that."
Frozen,3c34nm,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"Darth Sidious was actually the most powerful Force-user of his time, not Darth Vader. Vader, due to his cyborg body, was vulnerable to and could not produce Force Lightning like the Emperor could."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"Well, Elsa's powers have the capacity to defeat them , but Elsa isn't a fighting character, so she'd lose. She's just not for fighting :P."
Frozen,3c34nm,n00dles__,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think she could normally, even with fighting experience. You have to go high-end to start seeing some more balanced results.  We can always go Wank!Elsa though, and she godstomps the Avengers :p."
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, MCU Cap alone could solo Elsa, easily. Unless Elsa does an area-of-effect flash freeze right off the bat, Cap can dodge pretty much anything she throws at him. Avengers lmaogodstomp  Elsanna (the Anna + Elsa fusion dance), however, that's a bit of a different story."
Frozen,3c34nm,n00dles__,2,Sun Jul 5 02:49:52 2015 UTC,So...Olga?
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:42:29 2015 UTC,The only reason Elsa loses here is because she is not a fighter. Low-end still has her performing some insane feats that she could likely take on one Avenger. High-end battle trained would be more balanced if she is going to fight them all at once. Wank interpretation has her beating them all with ease.  P.S: Elsanna is a universe buster.
Frozen,3c34nm,XNinja2017,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Anna might be as strong, fast, and agile as Cap but she doesn't have any fighting skill. Elsanna would still lose to the heavy hitters like Thor, Hulk,and Iron Man. Quicksilver would still be able to blitz her. Though she could probably take on Scarlet Witch.  Wank!Elsanna godstomps Genie and Thanos w/ IG at the same time"
Frozen,3c31xq,damocles2501,3,Sat Jul 4 07:48:22 2015 UTC,"Well, he did say they were loud :P"

Frozen,3c2kf5,Demian_Dillers,4,Sat Jul 4 04:25:59 2015 UTC,At least Anna had happy dreams.  I bet Elsa only had nightmares.  :(
Frozen,3c2kf5,Demian_Dillers,3,Sat Jul 4 04:50:52 2015 UTC,"Nightmares about her sister wanting to marry sociopaths or poor, commoner guys, good thing that neve...oh."

Frozen,3c2kf5,creepycherry,2,Sat Jul 4 07:26:24 2015 UTC,Only a visionary would predict the concept of animation
Frozen,3c2kf5,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jul 4 05:21:55 2015 UTC,Holy moly! That's exactly what I see when I close my eyes.
Frozen,3c2kf5,Demian_Dillers,3,Sat Jul 4 07:17:05 2015 UTC,"See Anna's smart, she would be the only one to foresee the rise of telletubies in the future."
Frozen,3c2kf5,Demian_Dillers,3,Sat Jul 4 05:01:52 2015 UTC,So she has superhuman strength and the ability to see the future!
Frozen,3c2kf5,Demian_Dillers,5,Sat Jul 4 05:20:05 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it's not food.   And I'm surprised Elsa isn't thinking about weird stuff.

Frozen,3c0koo,CarterDug,5,Fri Jul 3 19:08:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. That explains why I wasn't subscribed to it. A sub dedicated to sex with actual bears sounds like something I would have been subscribed to.

Frozen,3c1mcy,Chris857,5,Sat Jul 4 01:15:05 2015 UTC,Its possible the Kristoff was force  to learn because he seems to trade a lot with arendelle

Frozen,3c1mcy,Benskien,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"Most likely everyone was expected to learn to speak the official language of the country, including the natives.  It would be cool to have Kristoff say something in Sami in Frozen 2, though that probably won't happen since language barriers don't seem to exist in Disneyverse."
Frozen,3c1hvl,cyberdragon1,6,Fri Jul 3 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"My initial reaction would be to question whether the trailer is being intentionally misleading given how poorly the initial trailers represented Frozen 1. Well the fanbase isn't a hivemind, so I'm sure reactions would be varied. ;) Assuming the trailers were an accurate representation of the movie, it would kind of depend on the execution of it, and if it makes sense in the context of the series."
Frozen,3c1hvl,ArendelleKnight,3,Fri Jul 3 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"After Big Hero 6, no thanks!"
Frozen,3c1hvl,gazza3478,3,Sat Jul 4 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"https://vimeo.com/99382797   Honestly, I'd be excited. What ArendelleKnight said. What ArendelleKnight said."
Frozen,3c1hvl,CarterDug,2,Fri Jul 3 23:16:33 2015 UTC,This would honestly outright kill the franchise. I don't think there is much else to say really.
Frozen,3c1hvl,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jul 3 22:20:18 2015 UTC,"It probably will, but given how well Superhero movies are doing in the box office, I think people would still give it a watch just because of the superhero elements. But then again with the existence of the Original Frozen people might not"
Frozen,3c1hvl,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jul 3 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"I don't keep up-to-date with the movie industry so I am not very familiar with this sort of thing. Maybe it wouldn't be a total disaster in the box office, but it would completely demolish what pushed the franchise to popularity which was the fanbase."
Frozen,3c1hvl,Portgas,2,Fri Jul 3 22:53:27 2015 UTC,"1) I'd be hyped. I love superhero movies. It's not exactly a direction I want Frozen to take, but I'll be okay with it.  2) People will be furious. Real fans will be chill about it and excited for new possiblities and adventures. It'd be a real test to find out what fans are made of.  3) Heh, I'd be curious to see a Frozen cinematic universe. These things are ""in"" right now."
Frozen,3c1hvl,AnonnyMiss,2,Fri Jul 3 22:47:34 2015 UTC,Was this discussion topic inspired by my comment earlier today?
Frozen,3c1hvl,Live-Hedgehog,2,Sat Jul 4 00:38:35 2015 UTC,I'd just wait till Frozen 3 & Knuckles comes out.
Frozen,3c1hvl,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jul 4 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"If your gonna jump the shark, might aswell give Anna fire powers. This is one of the worst things possible they could do. Anything focusing too much on the powers would be bad.  Edit: just by looking at big hero 6, it would be very bad"
Frozen,3c1hvl,LastUniqueUserID,2,Sat Jul 4 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be really disappointed.  I don't hate superhero movies, but honestly they're so overdone at this point and we don't need another one.  Frozen is unique because it's unique (if you know what I mean)!  Other movies should try to replicate Frozen.  Frozen should try to replicate other movies."
Frozen,3c1hvl,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jul 4 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"Frozen has the necessary elements for it. The movie could be very good, there would be no need to panic until we watch it and in the end we need to remember there are many kinds of superhero movies that could fit a great Frozen storyline. As for the fandom, we would see how it would react in general after the movie."
Frozen,3c1hvl,Luimnigh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"If there's still songs and the sisterly relationship, they can ride straight into superhero territory and never look back. Dunno. Dunno."

It depends on the arc. If Anna ends up with fire powers then maybe a little bit initially but not that much in the long term. If Elsa gets fire powers then quite a lot would change when she somehow ends up the Avengers universe. If neither get fire powers then nothing will really change unless A, E or K dies."
Frozen,3c1gch,HeimrArnadalr,2,Fri Jul 3 21:56:12 2015 UTC,10 out of 10.

Frozen,3c1gch,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jul 3 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Try again and see if you can get a perfect score   I'm curious why the page would say that if you already had a perfect score. Your quote is the message that appears when you have 8/10 or 9/10. This is what appears at 10/10: ""You got a perfect score! Can we just say something crazy? You’re really good at matching Frozen quotes with the characters who said them. Great mental synchronization!"""
Frozen,3c1gch,creepycherry,2,Sat Jul 4 01:58:24 2015 UTC,That is really what it gave me. No joke. I guess my suspicions were correct. I did find that message rather odd.

Frozen,3c0ucx,forresthopkinsa,9,Fri Jul 3 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Impressive yes, but it didn't really seem to have the same impact on society that Frozen generated. Along with the revenue that it garnered for Disney, it also became a phenomena that enveloped the world in a massive craze that persists to this very day. I don't think this film will surpass, let alone come anywhere near Frozen on that aspect. That's what sets Frozen apart from the other major films."
Frozen,3c0ucx,XNinja2017,8,Fri Jul 3 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"I saw a bit more ads of Inside-Out than I did with Frozen... Frozen, by the way, had a shitty  advertisements that focused more on Olaf and Sven than freaking Elsa..."
Frozen,3c0ucx,TeleVue,3,Fri Jul 3 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"Why should we panic when this doesn't really mean anything? Frozen's word of mouth didn't spread too quickly until near Christmas time. Also, Inside Out was a fantastic movie that I'd put with at least the same caliber as Frozen, if not, even higher - so it's nice to see it do well. All-in-all, this is quite healthy for Disney to produce more future films, and I'm happy that both have a chance to pull in big bucks."
Frozen,3c0ucx,potato-table,5,Fri Jul 3 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is definitely time to panic. I've seen Inside Out twice and it's a great movie; I would not be surprised to see it crack 1 billion like Frozen did.  There's also going to be an Inside Out short film which may compete with Frozen Fever at the Oscars."
Frozen,3c0ucx,HeimrArnadalr,3,Fri Jul 3 19:16:48 2015 UTC,And Lava. Gonna be a lot of Disney fighting for that category.
Frozen,3c0ucx,Chris857,4,Fri Jul 3 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"No it's not. When Frozen came out there was no competition, Inside Out has to compete against both Jurassic World and Minions. Minions alone already has as much of a marketing push as Frozen did AFTER release.  EDIT: Also upon reading some of the comments one person's said that Frozen's first week was only at the El-Capitan so the numbers aren't even worth comparing."
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,2,Fri Jul 3 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"The numbers come from Box Office Mojo's showdown, which states it is using the wide release for each movie to determine the starting point."
Frozen,3c0ucx,HeimrArnadalr,3,Fri Jul 3 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"I'm still sceptical beyond belief, especially considering both films had a staggered release."
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,3,Fri Jul 3 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"Well, time will tell. Frozen didn't get really popular until about a month after its release anyway."
Frozen,3c0ucx,HeimrArnadalr,4,Fri Jul 3 20:01:51 2015 UTC,Which is when Europe got it.
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"The showdown is starting from the first day of release, so they are comparing Frozen's El Capitan run directly to Inside Out being in 4000 theaters."
Frozen,3c0ucx,ChiSoxRox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"Look at the note under the Domestic Summary chart, where it says data is used starting from the first weekend of wide release. They're comparing Inside Out's 3,946 theaters to Frozen's 3742."
Frozen,3c0ucx,HeimrArnadalr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"Look at the day-by-day breakdown and you'll see they are not doing that for the cumulative total.  That ""first wide release weekend"" note is only for that opening week table it is immediately under."
Frozen,3c0ucx,ChiSoxRox,4,Sat Jul 4 23:23:52 2015 UTC,More money to add to Frozen 2's budget is never a bad thing.
Frozen,3c0ucx,10TailBeast,6,Fri Jul 3 20:37:32 2015 UTC,"Why would you panic? I don't get this sub, is anything that isn't frozen bad? I mean look, most of the money that this makes goes to Disney. Disney made Frozen, this isn't really a competition.  Besides Inside out is a fantastic movie, one of the better animated movies ever made and perhaps as good as Pixar has ever done. It deserves all the money it gets"
Frozen,3c0ucx,SomecallmeMichelle,3,Fri Jul 3 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"I think people want it to continue being the highest grossing animated film, I can't really blame them. Especially after Furious 7 and Jurassic World earning so much."
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,7,Fri Jul 3 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"I don't care for numbers a lot, I mean, knowing I own the highest grossing movie of all time doesn't influence just how much I enjoy the movie, and its characters. (except maybe hans, the bastard)"
Frozen,3c0ucx,SomecallmeMichelle,4,Fri Jul 3 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"(except maybe hans, the bastard)   I like you."
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,2,Fri Jul 3 21:15:57 2015 UTC,Seems pretty normal to want the franchise of the fandom to be awarded and deemed as important as it can. Every fandom I've seen takes pride on that and no one likes the central subject to be beaten. Competition between 2 products of a company is also normal and existent.

Frozen,3c0ucx,Demian_Dillers,3,Fri Jul 3 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"Why panic at all? The hell if Frozen gets overtaken as the highest grossing animated movie, we are getting Frozen 2 and that's what Frosties should focus on. ;)   Just because your favourite band never scored a #1 hit, doesn't mean you find them totally F@#$^ awesome."

Frozen,3c0ucx,dragongt1994,3,Mon Jul 6 16:56:06 2015 UTC,It would be motivation for the animators to do better
Frozen,3c0ucx,LastUniqueUserID,3,Sat Jul 4 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I saw Inside Out a few days ago, and while it wasn't a bad movie, for me it had nowhere near the emotional punch that Frozen had.  Maybe I was expecting too much due to the overwhelming number of positive reviews that I saw.  Honestly, I wouldn't even rank it in my top 5 Pixar movies.  I think in the coming weeks it will drop off much more quickly than Frozen did.  Anyway, if Inside Out does pass Frozen then it's all good, since they're both owned by Disney!  EDIT:  Also, while Inside Out's box office performance has been impressive, it's still 16.5 percent behind the $258.83 million two-week gross of 2010's Toy Story 3, and we all know what movie passed that to become the all-time #1 animated film."
Frozen,3c0ucx,BoldlyTheyRode,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"It could be close, but it highly doubt it'll have the legs Frozen did."
Frozen,3c0ucx,Portgas,2,Fri Jul 3 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, won't come close with Jurassic and Minions on its tail. But it will be a hit, no arguing there. I don't see much hype for it or any prominent fandom emerging, though."
Frozen,3c0ucx,gazza3478,2,Fri Jul 3 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that Minions is already out here in the UK, we don't get Inside Out until the 24th :)"
Frozen,3c0ucx,Sylra,2,Fri Jul 3 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know, and yes as a Frozen fan, I want it to stay the best animation film, I can't deny that.  But when you think about it, has Frozen been really advertised well ? I am not a Disney fan in fact, and I think the reason which made me want to watch Frozen is probably the gifs (of Elsa mostly) around the internet, and let's speak about the trailers which are probably the worst you can make, honestly."
Frozen,3c0ucx,AnonnyMiss,2,Sat Jul 4 10:03:09 2015 UTC,Nope- they're both ultimately Disney. It shouldn't be a competition.
Frozen,3c0ucx,Luimnigh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Let's not panic here. Inside Out may have the bigger opening, but Frozen had legs. It earned it's money by not closing until the next September, and then opened again for Christmas."
Frozen,3c0ucx,ChiSoxRox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:11:35 2015 UTC,"Frozen was in limited release for a week before expanding wide, and winter films never open huge but have long legs, the exact opposite of summer. This comparison is meaningless."
Frozen,3c0ucx,Theroonco,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Frozen was initially seen as a little girls' film until everyone realised its advertising didn't do it service. That and its themes caused it to blow up later. Inside Out, on the other hand, has always been advertised as a family film as all Pixar's films (to my knowledge). That plus the great reviews could account for why more people have been willing to see it before the ""everyperson"" reviews came in.  We'll see what happens from now. I don't see Inside Out moving as much merchandise though. At least for now. We'll see what happens of course. Disney may decide to push it too, not that there's anything wrong with other films getting their due, regardless of rivalry :)"

Frozen,3byeyy,ApathyPyramid,5,Fri Jul 3 05:02:05 2015 UTC,Ideally. I don't think anyone particularly wants to be on reddit. The alternatives just don't have the same number of niche communities.
Frozen,3byeyy,charredgrass,2,Fri Jul 3 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. We're all probably going back to normal once we get an actual response from reddit."
Frozen,3byeyy,Portgas,5,Fri Jul 3 05:05:26 2015 UTC,I hope everything will return to normal as soon as possible

Frozen,3byeyy,trenchino,3,Fri Jul 3 20:25:34 2015 UTC,Have to chip in to say that this has also brought to light how much work mods in reddit in general have to work through.  This subreddit was where I began my reddit journey and I am fully supportive of what you guys are doing. (although I am not really affected so my opinion doesn't count for much :()
Frozen,3byeyy,greenlamb,2,Fri Jul 3 05:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think we just want the issue to be known, but not totally inconvenience all users. Good to know you started here, sometimes it's good to know that what mods do actually matter! And your opinion counts as much as any other guy :)"
Frozen,3byeyy,Sylra,3,Fri Jul 3 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"While it would hurt me to not have my daily dose of Frozen, putting the subreddit in private would not put more impact to the thing ?  Well I know this is not a big subreddit so probably not but I was just wondering."

Frozen,3byeyy,TheHappyJammer,6,Fri Jul 3 11:13:53 2015 UTC,"Arendelle Castle was packed. Really packed.  People of all backgrounds were there. However they were there not because of an event, but an emergency.   I, /u/TheHappyJammer saw myself inside thinking of what has happened... it all happened so fast. The Southern Isles, the boat, the mysterious creatures that chased me.   As I wait in the castle, I recognize some folks waiting. Among them was /u/XNinja2017, /u/Demian_Dillers, /u/damocles2501, /u/TeleVue,/u/thelateralbox and other residents wearing various Arendellian garb. Knowing from where I come from, the Southern Isles, this seemed very unnerving of what I here about this place. I walked up to one of the men in the front corner of the ballroom, smiling, and giggling. He was /u/charredgrass and I asked him what was happening here.  ""This never happens."" he says while recovering from a conversation he had with /u/greenlamb. /u/greenlamb says hello before sticking a copy of The Frozen Effect in his face and leaving. /u/charredgrass goes on to say, ""Someone is censoring us. We must hide here.""  I was confused and my mind began to come up with theories.  ""Is it the Snow Queen?""  ""No, it is worst!""  And just like that a huge shaking occurred in the castle. Ice started to form around the halls and the candles all went out like a gust of wind blew them out through.  I ran out of the ballroom and notices the stark ice spikes shake in the walls and spinning snowflakes floating, before I rush out of the castle and find above me in the sky a large snowflake spinning. Wind gathers around my feet as small snowflakes span with all of them sticking to the large snowflake spinning.  ""NOBODY CALM DOWN!"" someone shouts as the castle inside roars in a panic. I turn around and see all of the people inside rushing outside to to see the terrifying spectacle that was the spinning snowflake.  I myself turned around amidst the chaos and heard a noise of unbearable crushing proportions. The same mysterious creature, dare I say that alien was sitting on top of an Arendelle guard which I heard that horrific sound from, broken bones. Everyone behind me was frozen in fear. /u/charredgrass shouts ""NOBODY CALM DOWN NOW!!!""   My rage has built up to this point, the chaos was genuinely boiling my emotions over. I traced myself to this monster. The monster responds with an inaudible, but load noise that rung my ears. Then out of nowhere, /u/XNinja2017 sped toward this monster and says ""Glory to ELSA!!"" Then he jumps the monster down from the gates. He hits the monster over and over again with blood and bone crushing action as everyone else watches in shock. When it was all set and done, the monster, that apparently terrorized all of us was laying dead. /u/XNinja2017 finds a zipper on the body. Confused he unzipped it and my heart froze when I recognized those bloody sideburns...  NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Frozen,3byeyy,greenlamb,5,Fri Jul 3 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"... Suddenly a group of Elsa-sneeze mini-snowmen popped out of thin air, and danced a ring around the fallen prince, chanting ""Ding dong, the prince is dead!""   ""Nooo! GO AWAY!"" /u/thehappyjammer screamed, sobbing while he pushed the minions away. He frantically stomped on them, turning one or two into powdered snow beneath his feet."
Frozen,3byeyy,Schadenfreudenous,4,Fri Jul 3 07:31:49 2015 UTC,"Six hours later, /u/Schadenfreudenous wakes up in the wine cellar. He has absolutely no idea what just happened, and would very much appreciate it if somebody told him.  He walks into the great hall, and looks around. Nobody is there. He wonders why nobody protests as he decorates the walls in Kristelsa-related content. But then...to his horror...his realizes...the decorations don't stick. He can't hang anything.  /u/Schadenfreudenous returns to the wine cellar."
Frozen,3byeyy,greenlamb,4,Fri Jul 3 07:51:51 2015 UTC,"And to his utmost horror, worst that his wildest nightmares, he found that in a flurry of Matrix-like deja-vu changes, /u/greenlamb and /u/orangefeels stuck the wine cellar full of...  KRISTANNA POSTERS.  *insert Wilhelm scream*  PS: here's the link to the summary of the issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/"
Frozen,3byeyy,Schadenfreudenous,4,Fri Jul 3 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"/u/Schadenfreudenous snatches the last keg and bolts from the wine cellar. He picks up a nearby corpse and uses it to bar the door(because this is somehow possible). /u/Schadenfreudenous runs off into the night to bother somebody else.  In the meantime, /u/Theroonco is nowhere to be seen..."
Frozen,3byeyy,Theroonco,5,Fri Jul 3 14:37:46 2015 UTC,"For he was far above the cellar.  He was far above the chaos of the courtyard.  He was in the Queen's chamber.    Presently she was looking through the huge triangle window, crisscrossed with supports in an intricate yet simple pattern, at the crowd below. ""It's not working,"" she looked at her general with fright. ""You said the snowflake would be enough to make them run and hide, but it's not working!""  /u/Theroonco stepped to the window. He didn't sit on his knees at the sill as his Majesty had. Instead he peered at the crowd below. ""There's a fight there, Queen Elsa,"" he began. ""It looks like -"" Here he paused, looked at the empty harbour and cursed. ""That's /u/XNinja2017, my lieutenant. He was supposed to prepare the fleet, not roll around in the dirt like some common thug!""  His outburst had shocked the Queen. She was on her feet, cowering from him, dressed in the familiar ice dress. He exhaled. ""Apologies, Your Majesty, but this complicates things."" He turned to face the room. With them were his second lieutenant, a brunette with a solemn face, and a soldier who had accompanied her on their way to meet him here, in the Queen's room.  He turned to the soldier first. ""I don't know much about you man,"" he advanced on him ""but our situation is dire. We need to secure - at the very least - Arendelle's flagship, to protect our Queen. /u/HikariOni will need to use the passageway outside this room. It will take her to an alley behind the castle. From there she will need to reach the docks and speak to the ship's captain. I had him prepare the essentials when we first received reports of a possible threat. Once it and the path to it are safe, I will lead the Queen to meet with you.""  ""Yes sir, but why are you telling me?""  ""Because,"" /u/Theroonco was in the man's face now. They weren't too far apart in height, but the general's cold stare made him appear a giant in comparison to him ""you will be supporting her. She has proven herself to this kingdom. You will not fail her. You will not. Fail. Me. Do you understand?""  ""Ye - yes sir."" He backed away and stood behind Hikari. She nodded to /u/Theroonco then looked at the Queen.  ""With all due respect Queen Elsa,"" she bit her lip. Talking to royalty was always intimidating, ""are you sure you don't want a squadron to look for the Princess and Sir Kristoff?""  ""Yes.""  ""You said they were safe with his family, but we don't know how many men are attacking us. They could be armed. They could be dangerous - more dangerous than his family can -""  ""I assure you, they're safe.""  Hikari flushed, but Elsa's smile was gentle, understanding, reassuring. She nodded. ""As you wish, Queen Elsa."" She turned to her lackey. ""You heard the man /u/AdultSupervision. With me.""    When the door closed behind the duo Elsa turned to /u/Theroonco. ""You didn't need to scare him like that.""  The general just laughed. ""I wanted to let him know what would happen if he betrayed us.""  ""You think he will?""  ""Indeed. I've had my doubts for a long time. It's why I've had /u/HikariOni keep an eye on him all this time; it's no coincidence he was the only soldier she was able to bring here. We'll see what he does.""  ""But...he could not be a traitor, right?""  ""The sideburns are suspicious, but I respect him for having a tactful name at least."" /u/Theroonco shrugged. ""He's far better than that woman who called herself /u/teamhans of all things."" He scoffed at the memory, then grew solemn. ""But she's been incarcerated for a long time. She can't have been the one to have let that masked person onto our roof and even if she did, not by herself.""  ""Perhaps, but I'd rather not have to doubt any of my subjects."" Elsa looked at the floor and hugged herself. The general opened his mouth to answer but the two heard sounds from the corridor beyond. Footsteps. Fast. Elsa gulped and balled her fists, wisps of ice floating around them. /u/Theroonco's hand went to the falchion at his waist.  But he reconsidered before his flesh met the hilt and instead drew his rifle from the holster across his back. He flipped the weapon in his hands before aiming it at the door. ""I'd rather not either,"" he said calmly, hoping the Queen would not be scared. They would not hang their heads in defeat this day.  ""Besides,"" he peered down the length of the barrel, ""I think they make a cute couple.""  Yay, sub stories!"
Frozen,3byeyy,Schadenfreudenous,3,Fri Jul 3 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Chilled Wine    As /u/Theroonco defended the Queen, and the auspicious pair of /u/HikariOni and the suspicious soldier sped towards the docks, something far less interesting was occurring below...    /u/Schadenfreudenous burst through the tower door, rushing down the steps and flew onto the rocky beach beside the castle. He whipped his head around in a drunken haze, searching for a way out of his predicament. Shouting and crashing rang out from above like the noise of thunder. He could not tell apart the voices throughout the din.  Stumbling forward, /u/Schadenfreudenous clutched his aching head. He really had drunken too much, hadn't he? As he made his way towards the water, intending to wash his face clean of drowsiness, his foot caught a rock. Making an expression reminiscent of a sloth missing a tree-branch, he pitched face forward into the ground, and rolled down the rocky shore, his keg spinning off in the opposite direction.  Groaning from the impact, he tried to right himself, but quickly slipped and faceplanted once more. As he gathered what senses he could(they are rather limited, you see, when one is afflicted with a hangover as serious as his), he realized what he was lying upon - the fjord was once again freezing over. He tentatively heaved himself up on his hands and knees, and rolled a spot check(because why not?).  While it seemed the fjord was once again icing over, it was not thick. The blizzard had not yet begun. Even worse - and to his amounting horror - /u/Schadenfreudenous' last keg of wine had rolled out onto the thin ice.  He had entered an entirely new world of problems...    If you're wondering whether or not I'm actually going to follow the adventures of a drunk and his keg of wine, the answer is yes. It will also go somewhere useful, eventually. Fear not, for said drunk is not entirely useless.  This overall story is getting fun!"
Frozen,3byeyy,Theroonco,3,Fri Jul 3 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"/u/HikariOni raced down the steps, pushing off of the narrow walls for balance as she went. /u/AdultSupervision ran behind her. He tried to keep up, yet his superior was always just out of arm's reach.  He wondered if that was intentional. He knew how similar his sideburns were to his.  ""How much further?"" he asked, his voice echoing back and forth from the high ceiling.  ""This tunnel runs from the top of the castle to the ground,"" Hikari yelled over her shoulder, ""do you really think we'd be there by now?""  He knew everything about these tunnels, but he couldn't let her know that. ""Do you really think the Princess is safe?""  ""Queen Elsa says she is and I trust her judgement."" But Hikari stopped all the same. Adult was grateful for the distance between them as it gave him room to also stop before he collided with her. ""But..I'd be happier if I could be sure."" she resumed running at the same pace.  ""Do you think /u/Theroonco felt the same way?"" Adult was closer this time, a virtue of Hikari not having as much of a head start this time.  ""What do you mean?""  ""Maybe he sent someone to keep an eye on them?""  Hikari stopped again. This time Adult did run into her. Luckily the lieutenant's footing was too strong for them to topple and she pushed him back without looking.  ""Maybe. If not, maybe I should...""    Anna and Kristoff had had a relaxing day. Surprising, given they had spent it with the trolls. Then again, maybe it had been relaxing because the majority of them had been fascinated by Olaf and were currently celebrating his induction into their ranks. They were watching their antics from a distance, sitting with Pabbie after he had rolled away from the sham ceremony.  A rock came towards them. Normally this would be a cause of alarm - and concern for the friends and families of the beholder of such a phenomenon - but the rock unfurled into a troll. It took a moment for Anna to recognise him as Cliff, Kristoff's adoptive father.  I should have already known that. Eek.  In the time it had taken for Anna to identify the troll, Pabbie had already questioned his worried look.  ""There are men on the outskirts of the forest Grand Pabbie,"" he gushed, ""armed men.""  ""It has happened."" muttered the elder troll.  ""What happened?"" This was Kristoff.  ""Elsa warned me that the castle may come under harm. I told her not to worry, but this..."" he shook his head, ""I was a fool to be so optimistic.""  ""Wait, she told you?"" Anna blinked. ""I mean, of course she told you, we all respect you, but she didn't say anything to me. Or Kristoff.""  ""Anna, my child..."" Pabbie looked at her, his face solemn. ""Did you not find it suspicious that she advised you to spend time with us so suddenly?""  ""I..."" Anna's eyes widened, then narrowed. ""We need to go back. I'm not - "" Pabbie and Cliff had rolled in front of her and were pushing her back, ""Let me go! I'm not letting Elsa fight a war on her own!""  ""Please, my child, listen to reason!"" It didn't work. ""You can help your sister!""  That did.  Anna stopped. The trolls sagged against her shins in relief. Kristoff had never expected to see Pabbie so relaxed or improper in his life.  ""How can I help her?"" she asked.  ""Listen to me closely Anna,"" Pabbie began. ""Until someone comes for you, do not leave this place - let me finish! - do not leave this place until your time has come.""  ""What is that supposed to mean?""  ""It means don't interrupt the narrative.""    The bedroom doors burst open, the sound of the action followed a second later by the discharge of /u/Theroonco's rifle. The man who had opened the doors had no chance to react. He had leaned into the motion and the bullet tore through his chin, piercing his neck. Elsa saw everything in slow motion. The second attacker, a woman, had been on his right and was charging into the room, her sword already drawn. The third had had the misfortune to stand directly behind the first and had died to the same bullet.  Two more attackers, a man and a woman charged into the room from Elsa and /u/Theroonco's right. Roonco advanced on the first woman, batting away her blade with the side of his gun and slamming its butt into the side of her head. Elsa fired shards of ice at the feet of attackers four and five, forcing them back. Two more thuds from her left signaled attacker two leaving the fight - though hopefully not this world - and a second bullet slew attacker five, the woman, where she stood, throwing her body against the open door.  The last man had drawn a pistol and leveled it at the captain as his last comrade had died. He fired at Roonco's chest, but the shot missed by just an inch as a shard of ice threw the weapon from his hand, breaking his fingers with its force. He looked at the Queen and screamed, raising his sword and stepping forward - toward her previous row of spikes. Elsa saw the death in his eyes and cowered, her hands reaching out instinctively.  A final blast of life left her, pinning him to the door, encasing him in ice.  Elsa gazed in horror. She had killed someone. She had frozen someone. She must have hit their heart. The man's body was covered in ice, the casing ending in tendrils of ice snaking over the wood. She whimpered as Theroonco stepped forward and placed two fingers on his neck.  ""He's alive, Your Majesty.""  ""He...he is?""  ""Yes."" The general sighed. He had not wanted to kill today. He had wanted to scare the thugs, but the speed at which they had advanced had forced his hand. At least...  ""The woman is alive too.""  Elsa's eyes fell to attacker two. She stared until she saw her chest rise, exhaling the breath she hadn't realised she'd been holding.  ""If you can, Queen Elsa, would you be so kind as to restrain her too?""  ""What? Just the hands and legs? I can do that, but..."" she looked at the man. He had grown pale. ""But they'll die.""  ""I won't let that happen, but they deserve some discomfort."" Roonco stepped to the window and began reloading his gun. ""We'll need to interrogate them too."" He looked at the courtyard. /u/XNinja2017's opponent had died, he realised with a jolt, and had been unmasked. He couldn't see who it was - it couldn't be him, could it? - but he saw a third figure jumping on...  Snowgies?  Elsa was afraid after all. ""We'll need to move. We'll take the tunnel and follow Hikari and Adult."" He'd finished preparing the rifle and slung it back over his shoulder. ""Hopefully they'll have the ship ready and...""  The fjord was freezing over.  Roonco paused. It was fortunate the navy had invested in icebreakers.  Elsa had joined him and winced at the spreading ice. ""I'm sorry,"" the words spilled out of her. ""I have some spare gloves, I'll -""  ""Don't worry, Your Majesty."" The Queen's inner circle were privy to what the gloves had done.  And what they represented.  No one wanted that back in their lives. In her life.  ""You'll be fine."" He looked back at the fjord. It was freezing slowly, which was useful. The Queen had improved her control and hopefully she would have relaxed by the time they got to the sea. Of course, that would require them not facing any resistance and that Hikari and Adult would have the ship secure in the few minutes' head start they had gotten. And now that he thought of it, could the Queen have a fear of the sea? No, she had gone to visit Queen Marisol with no panic after . At least none the public had seen.  He saw something on the frozen surface.  ""Is that...there's a man down there."" He pointed him out to the Queen. ""And, unless I'm mistaken, is that a wine barrel?""  ""We can deal with thieves later.""  ""Of course, I'm just curious that he would be here at this time - and would have managed to get a barrel so far. Hikari and Adult will pass by there soon, unless I'm mistaken. They may investigate him for us.  ""Unless they decide to let his story play out.""  Edit: The gates have opened on the sub. We could compile chapters in posts as we write them here from now. Shall I start after the next chapter?"
Frozen,3byeyy,Schadenfreudenous,3,Fri Jul 3 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Unhappy Introductions    Arendelle was a fair country. Who could not think so? It was a picture of pure poetry, a song shaped by the lilting voice of mother nature herself. Glittering fjords laced along rolling green hills, leading the foothills of the mountains. Forests cascaded the landscape in a brilliant shade of pine. And the mountains. Oh, the mountains. They rose and fell past the hills, sprouting upwards like the bones of the world. Some rounded or tapered, and some sharp and jagged, there were none who could vouch against the beauty of Arendelle's mountains. Not a soul who did not love that wonderful country.  Well, maybe just one.  /u/Zarith7480 might have called it a nice day. If, perhaps, he were at home. And if, perhaps, he was not tied to the mast of his own ship. He had had worse days, maybe. Being captured by pirates - that was bad. The captain had not been the, ah, kindest of men - jovial though. No denying that. Roberts, did they call him?  The point was, it wasn't a good day. Zarith sighed. He should be at home, in Corona. It hadn't been pirates this time, at least. He had not yet figured out who these ruffians were. They had been dressed in mis-matched armor and uniforms - no telling which country they truly hailed from. Plenty of weapons though.  They had taken his gold, knocked him out, and tied him to the mast of his own ship.  Zarith sighed again.  Being a merchant wasn't the problem. The problem was being a merchant who delivered goods to Arendelle. He had so far figured out this was the worst possible port of call on Earth.  The first time he had been in Arendelle, you see, he had been a rather happy merchant. Oh, yes. Good job, plenty of money. Light on adventure, but it was there if you wanted it. Everything was grand...until the coronation.  He had spent three days digging his ship out of the ice. Three. straight. days. He was nearly done chipping the ice too, and then what? It just disappears. All of the ice, gone. He had spent three days digging his ship out of the ice, only for it all to disappear just as he was finishing.  He had nearly quit right there. And that wasn't to mention what happened the next time he had sailed into port - some idiot had not only gotten a sled and a reindeer aboard his ship, but managed to wreck just about every inch of it. And the time after that...well, he'd rather not think of it.  Zarith harkened back to his most recent trip here. When his ship had been plastered in snow-imps. Little demons they were. He was still paying off the damage.  Yet again, he sighed.  He heard some  shouting coming from the left. He quickly looked over, spotting a group of men boarding a nearby vessel - another merchant ship, by the look of it.  ""HELLO!? OVER HERE! I COULD REALLY USE SOME....help""  He watched as the men began torching the ship, tipping a powder keg over and setting it alight.  ""Nevermind"", he squeaked.  It was then that he remembered the reason he had come to Arendelle this season. He had been exporting gunpowder.  Zarith began struggling against the ropes.  Realizing it was futile, he looked around for any sort of sharp object, felt behind him for a splinted bit of wood. Anything at all.  The winds began to pick up slightly. There was a chill in the air. With a horrible feeling in his gut, Zarith looked towards the castle. The fjord had begun to freeze. Again.  He really, really hated Arendelle.    /u/Schadenfreudenous carefully balanced himself on the ice. It was spreading across the fjord at a dreadfully slow rate, which meant it wasn't getting any thicker. At least, not anytime soon.  He spread himself out slightly on his hands and knees - standing was too dangerous. Couldn't be done on ice this thin, not unless he had a death wish.  No, of course not. He had a wine wish.  Schaden looked across the ice, where his keg of Arendelle's Finest was teetering dangerously close to the edge of the ice. At least it was spreading.  He tentatively crawled towards the keg, moving a few inches at a time. It was slow work. As he pushed forward, the ice began to make low, groaning noises. Wincing slightly, Schaden stopped in his tracks. He looked up.  He was dumbfounded.  A bird had landed on top of the keg. A black one. A crow, maybe? Or were they jackdaws...  He didn't care. He shouted as quietly as he could(for there was still a battle raging on the bridge and in the courtyard, the noise of which was still causing his head to ache).  As the bird flew off, he silently praised himself, only to have his happiness cut short. A new spot of bad luck had appeared.  This is, roughly, how the following events unfolded:  A bird, small in size, flopped onto the ice. It flopped about, much as a fish does when it is out of water. For it was, indeed, out of water. Far above, upon the castle parapets, an albatross spotted said fish. It is to be noted that the albatross is an extaordinarily large bird, capable of carrying quite a bit of weight, if it so wishes. The fish, sensing itself being watched, flopped harder. Straight onto the keg of wine. The albatross dove. As it so happened, not only did the albatross grab the fish, it also snagged a rope attached to the keg.  Schaden watched in utmost horror as his Arendelle's Finest flew west.  ""Ahhhh. Ah. Eh.""  Were the only sounds he was able to stutter as he made his way back across the ice.    Reaching the shore, Schaden slumped down onto the rocky beach. He was tired. His head ached. It was too bright out. And that rock was making far too much noise than a rock should be making.  His eyes shot open as he began to hold his breath. Schaden slowly turned himself over, listening as intently as he could while the storm of battle raged from the castle.   Cautiously, he rose from the ground, and began creeping towards the offending boulder. It rocked back and forth, grinding against the stone of the castle wall. As he reached out to touch it -   CRACK!   The boulder flew back from the castle wall with a sudden swiftness, knocking Schaden across the face as it whizzed by. He found himself on the ground yet again.    ""Well...that's another solution"", muttered /u/AdultSupervision.  Himself and /u/HikariOni had found their way out of the castle tunnels at last.  ""Well, your so-called 'man-power' didn't seem to be working, so I decided to improvise"" replied Hikari, through gritted teeth.  ""Check the beach"", she followed. ""I'll have a look over the wall"". Hikari clambered up a nearby hill beside Arendelle's chief manner of defense.  Adult scanned up and down the beach for anything that might prove a danger to them. His eyes found the sodden drunk lying face-first in the gravel.  ""A corpse, so far from the battlefield? That is...strange""  He kicked it. The corpse gave a groan.  Adult snorted.  ""Ma'am, this one's still breathing"" he said in a drawling tone.  Adult knelt down to examine the man, before noticing his comrade's silence. He looked up to see why she did not reply.  Hikari stood stock-still atop the out-cropping. Her face had gone pale with shock.  ""Ma'am, what's wrong!?""  He sprinted up the hill, peering over the wall himself...and realized the position they were now in.  The ships were being burned.    I do have a plan for exactly what happens to everyone following that last scene, but thought the chapter was getting a bit long, so I ended it here.  EDIT: Plot hole fixing."
Frozen,3byeyy,Theroonco,3,Fri Jul 3 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"It should have been easy. The plan was simple. The passageway was right there, yet as soon as they approached a second wave of thugs thundered into view. Elsa created walls of ice to seal the men and women away as /u/Theroonco fired at those lucky enough to escape her power. At the Queen's behest he used non-lethal force. Not that he complained as he shot thighs and knees. When the hallway was clear he ushered his charge to the wall and began pressing against it. The passage was somewhere here. Relax. Concentrate.  ""Sir?""  Roonco and Elsa whirled around to see /u/Captain_Gardar had just climbed the steps.  ""What is it soldier?""  ""The enemy is advancing sir, we need assistance.""  Roonco frowned. He trusted Gardar's judgement, especially since the guard could clearly see he was escorting their Queen. He looked over the railing and cursed.  It was a battleground. Guards and mercenaries littered the maroon carpet, their blood almost blending in. Almost. The faint dissonance made the deaths worse. He grit his teeth and readied his rifle. It had a small clip, but it was built for precision. Until now he had wished he'd brought a blunderbuss, but those were in short supply and were being used in more advantageous areas.  He descended the first few steps, looking around the curve of the stairwell. His men were defending it, taking cover behind suits of armour and furniture as their foes advanced. He needed to get down, fast.  ""Queen Elsa. Stand where I am, that's right. Now, can you see who you need to capture?""  ""Yes.""  ""Good. Please do what you can Your Majesty. But prioritise the men at the back. Gardar, I need you to cover me. Do whatever you can to stay on your feet.""  ""What do you mean?""    /u/Cometlight grit his teeth as another hole was ripped through the sofa he had appropriated for cover. He hadn't expected wooden planks and fabric to shield him though. At least, not in the physical sense. He'd just need to break line of sight as he reloaded. He crept from the left side of the seat to the right and snuck a peek. No one had seen him. Good. He gripped his crossbow. It was old and slow, but it was reliable. He was about to take a shot when he heard several simultaneous gasps. Curiosity got the better of him and he snuck a second peek.  Only this one lasted for a while.  ""What the...""  A wall of ice had emerged, cutting the first wave of mercenaries off from their reinforcements. Some had turned to reunite with their comrades, a few just stared as ice flowed down the steps and coated the wooden floor (and were shot for their lack of judgement). Others hid under the little cover they had remembered to claim, preparing for the worst.  Comet crouched and looked back at the steps.  And his jaw dropped.  His general, Theroonco, came sliding down the stairs, low to the ground, legs outstretched. Gardar came behind him. Both leveled the rifles and fired. Both hit their marks. But they didn't stop when they reached the floor. Instead they shot forth, sliding out of the way of incoming fire and firing in kind as they passed the thugs' cover. Comet saw the glow of magic at Gardar's feet and looked up to see his Queen concentrating with her hands outstretched.  She was guiding them.  He awed at the spectacle until a roar tore his eyes away.    Theroonco and Gardar had each fired twice and had struck true with both hits. Gardar slid to a halt before the trapped goons while Theroonco trailed further, shooting towards a woman who just looked at him in awe as his rifle slammed into her head, throwing her into the window with a second thump. She crumpled to the floor but Roonco's attention had been drawn to the view.  The view of burning ships.  Their ships.  He hadn't heard his roar, but the woman had backed into the wall. He rested his gun against the wall and grabbed her, pulling her up. ""Who sent you?"" he demanded. ""How did you get in here? How did you get a man on our roof? How did you burn our ships?""  The woman was too dazed to answer, but would she have answered?  ""Talk! Or I'll make sure they will!"" he jerked his head towards her neutralised reinforcements. She just mumbled, blood trickling from her hairline. Roonco just snarled and picked his rifle up. It had one more shot. He raised it, aimed it at her chest.  ""Final answer?""  ""H...""  She took a deep breath.  ""Hail...Hans.""  ""Wrong answer.""  He fired into the woman's chest. It flew through her spine and out of the window, taking her with it. Roonco watched, impassive, as her body fell to the courtyard below, crashing between the assembled crowd and the castle gates. They were still closed. These thugs were either using some other entrance...  Or they were the castle's staff, it's guards.  The revelation shook Roonco, but another took its place.   If the woman hadn't died from the shot, she was certainly dead now.  He had killed again.  He turned to see Elsa. She had been freezing wounds shut but now looked at him. Pain burned in her eyes. Gardar had taken a step back. Even the guards by the stairs were wary.  He was letting his emotions get the better of him.    For a moment the second thud had confused the crowd as they watched the brawl between /u/XNinja2017 and /u/TheHappyJammer but, one by one, they turned and screamed and the second corpse behind them. The fighters only realised what had happened when they realised they were missing an audience. /u/thelateralbox and /u/TeleVue held the Hans lover down as /u/XNinja2017 fought his way through the crowd ""Soon to be ex-lieutenant here, coming through.""  /u/Demian_Dillers was crouching by the body when he made it into the clearing. ""What is it?"" asked Ninja.  Demian just looked up at the broken window. ""Roonco's angry again.""    The woman has a name, I just need to remember it... I remember."

And when a thriving democratic setting is quashed by outside higher forces, it is disgusting. Solidarity with our community in /r/Frozen is what we need to show that this like many subreddits won't stand idly by as out of control reddit admins are allowed to kill a community."

Frozen,3by124,Demian_Dillers,7,Fri Jul 3 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"Considering she only had ~15 minutes of screentime in the first one, I think so."
Frozen,3by124,OrangeFeels,4,Fri Jul 3 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeh, having it about Elsa would be dangerous. I like anna as the main protagonist because she was fun to watch, not so serious. If you make Elsa the protagonist, they might make the character less Elsa more Anna which I don't like. One example is how people reacted to the short. Elsa was more fleshed out there but a part of the fandom was turn off by this."
Frozen,3by124,dragongt1994,3,Fri Jul 3 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"If you make Elsa the protagonist, they might make the character less Elsa more Anna which I don't like.    Agreed, they might follow their line of princesses by making Elsa another free-spirited mold princess protagonist and well, if we lose ""Elsa"" in the process to get ""more Elsa"" then what's the point?. Elsa needs to be characterized well, making her like Anna would be worthless in terms of evolution and character gain.   One example is how people reacted to the short. Elsa was more fleshed out there but a part of the fandom was turn off by this.   Yup, even though I loved Elsa on Fever, a part of the fandom wasn't so sure, on this occasion we saw basically nothing of Anna other than she being responsible so she couldn't be questioned, but showing more of Elsa might be more problematic and something they should evaluate really carefully, every draft they have, they need to really take into account and consider all possible ways Elsa would develop and whatnot.   I don't think it's impossible to flesh out Elsa in a great way on the sequel, I think they can do it and it would be on all accounts, the best, but I do think it's way easier to follow the ""Leading Anna"" Path."
Frozen,3by124,dragongt1994,4,Fri Jul 3 03:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeh Anna has a great potential for change. She could have mature and take more responsibility. Anna would be flesh out how to handle a boyfriend and family. People are somehow underestimating Anna as character and at the same time overestimating Elsa as a character.   However I do believe the best option is keeping the girls at a balance. A problem that both persons would deal with. That's the good thing about Frozen, it wasn't just Elsa's problem, it was also anna's problem. Elsa just needed a few more scenes of development and the movie would have been improve significantly. So the best option is for both girls to be given equal screen time.  Edit: Anna is also less risky because she just a fleshed out character that most of the fans would know what to expect from her."

Anna would be flesh out how to handle a boyfriend and family. People are somehow underestimating Anna as character and at the same time overestimating Elsa as a character.    Yeah, I believe Anna has a lot of room to evolve as a character as well. Specially now that the world knows her sister has powers, perhaps they could focus on how much more the spotlight is on Elsa, maybe even having Anna be jealous of Kristoff and his admiration for Elsa's powers (not Kristelsa, nothing would happen between them, but Anna could still be insecure) and well, part with the ""more than just the spare"" storyline that was scrapped.   However I do believe the best option is keeping the girls at a balance. A problem that both persons would deal with. That's the good thing about Frozen, it wasn't just Elsa's problem, it was also anna's problem. Elsa just needed a few more scenes of development and the movie would have been improve significantly. So the best option is for both girls to be given equal screen time.   I think having them solving a problem together with their unique talents (Elsa's magic and creativity, Anna's capacity of forming a good social circle and adventurous nature) would be a cool way to go.   Edit: Anna is also less risky because she just a fleshed out character that most of the fans would know what to expect from her.   Since she was the protagonist , this is true, there's a lot more that's already settled for her including goals and results. Also the fact that she didn't become quite a symbol like Elsa did which gives her more freedom on the characterization."
Frozen,3by124,XNinja2017,3,Fri Jul 3 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"Well, time for a serious discussion.   Well, let's go through this step by step shall we?   When talking Frozen 2, one of the most common ideas thrown out there is that, since Anna was the protagonist of Frozen, yet Elsa is the most popular character, Elsa should be the main protagonist/focus of Frozen 2 or at the very least have as much focus as Anna with the two of them leading the film with lots of screen time. Now that sounds wonderful on paper, we all want to see more of out beloved Snow Queen, but, would this really be good?.   I think it's safe to assume that Frozen II will focus more on Elsa simply due to marketing. Elsa garners more profit and is more popular within the fanbase compared to Anna so Disney will of course take advantage of that. Elsa actually has a lot more room for development than her sister to be honest. The lack of screen time in the first film gives her that advantage.   Elsa is one of the highest risk characters that exist out there, with this I mean, the risk on continuing her story and going a ""wrong"" way is enormous. Almost every aspect of Elsa, whether it's her love life, her sexuality, the origin of her powers, her choices, etc... has the potential to be really controversial within the fandom. That's because how personal Elsa the fandom takes Elsa and also how many groups have taken her as a symbol of stuff she really wasn't even connected just because of LiG. It's also because of all the power Elsa has as an extremely recognizable character and the impact she had so far.   True, and Disney already acknowledges that. Disney couldn't anticipate that Elsa would have become so popular. I don't think we should worry too much. Like I said, Disney knows this and they know how significant and influential Elsa is among the fans and to their marketing. Elsa is just as important to them as she is to us.   Making her the main focus just increase the chances of ""ruining"" Elsa for a big part of the fandom a lot. Many people already felt Elsa was ""off"" during fever, while I personally loved her depiction I can understand how making her the central part of the plot can be way more dangerous. On the contrary we have Anna, the protagonist of Frozen 1, a simpler less risky character who still has a lot to develop really. Anna's love life is defined, she also has defined her priorities and her likes and desires, she probably could learn more stuff and perhaps even learn to deal with magical issues without magic. Continuing with Anna as the protagonist of the franchise while leaving Elsa as a support main character would be beneficial because the risk for backslash would be greatly diminished, sure people would be disappointed we didn't get to see more Elsa but that wouldn't really be as bad.   Ah, this is the big one. Frozen Fever is a poor example because it's supposed to depict her in such a manner. In fact, that depiction actually did her good as it provided us with a glimpse of how much she has improved during the time elapsed during the main film and the short. We shouldn't express any concern simply because a short film decided to depict her in such a manner. The short didn't diminish her character in any way, and it actually helped develop it further.  Both sisters possess many aspects that can still be developed further or refined. Anna already had her screen time yes, but I do agree that she shouldn't be left out because of that. I don't know, I can't really see much that Anna can still develop aside from maybe her relationship with Elsa and Kristoff. Beyond that, not much really. What else is there to do? The first film pretty much established her character quite well. It would be nice to see other sides of her like maybe what other interests or skills she may possess. This is why I think Elsa deserves the spotlight in the sequel. Like I said before, Anna is a line, Elsa is a manifold. The difference in complexity between them both is what sets them apart. Elsa's manifold analogy is what allows Disney to take a myriad of routes with the sequel, and that's what we need. It allows for the development of something entirely new, whereas Anna's linearity would be predictable and likely result in a sequel not much different than its predecessor.   Anna could be developed n a number of ways, be the entral part of the plot and the adventure, Elsa could appear in key scenes, and some to develop herself, like Hans on Frozen, and she would still be important just so much more neutral there wouldn't be much to scatter and cause controversy.   Here is what I find interesting and rather intruiging now. Developing one character over another impacts the franchise in a different way. Continuing with Anna as the protagonist would feel like it's centralizing the film on her and her very own life. Was it ever about her life? Did the story always revolve around her life? Think about it, and you realize that's not the case here. I like the idea of having Elsa as the main protagonist in the sequel because it has the potential to expand the entire franchise. Rather then expanding one character, we have the potential here to expand the Frozen franchise into something truly immense that if executed successfully could end up extending the longevity of the franchise considerably. Elsa has far more potential for the future of the franchise then her sister.   So, even if Elsa is generally the favorite character, perhaps the best would be to continue the mystery on her and have just much more Anna time like in Frozen, leaving Elsa behind, in the end we would get a much more developed and holder of much more points of interest Anna, and a not-so risky Elsa to just like the same.   Like I said, I am aware of the possible negative implications of having Elsa as the protagonist in the next installment, but if executed properly, it could push Frozen into yet another golden age. Something that IMO can never be achieved if Anna remains as Disney's focus."

The potential for a character depends a lot on their writer and how they visualize them.   Aye comrade, but in this instance it does. Want evidence? Look at the plethora of fanfiction and you see just how many possibilities exist. Yes, developing Elsa further would actually diminish that particular trait of her's, but that's totally expected because that's what they are aiming for now. What I am stating here is that Elsa's current ambiguous character allows for that possibility which is something that Anna explicitly lacks at the moment, hence why shifting the focus over to her might be the better option. The implications of this decision can be risky yes, but it can also extend the life of this franchise considerably. In the end, we are aiming to make them both simpler. I like to think of the relationship between Anna and Elsa here like how we are trying to find a unifying theory of physics. In their endeavors, both are essentially trying to attain the same outcome it being simplicity.   Yes, Jen Lee has stated that Frozen is Elsa's story told through Anna's adventure. That being said, wouldn't then be interesting to see really the place of Anna in all of this?, how her true story unfolds in a world that's now openly filled with magic and Snow Queen Elsa followers being her the ""normal bug""?   I will admit, this is a great point here. Anna is indeed the speck in the immense cosmic substrate, and watching her realize that would certainly be interesting to watch. I think finding a zone of balance between Elsa's development and this point you presented here is the key to a successful sequel."
Frozen,3by124,ArendelleKnight,5,Fri Jul 3 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"No.  I would rather the Disney team take the risk of ""ruining"" Elsa if it means giving us more of her, than to have Anna be the main character instead of Elsa in Frozen 2.  I like Anna, truly.  But I really want more Elsa."

However I do think that it's really dangerous and something to truly evaluate against our own desires. There's stuff to ponder and perhaps thinking with a cold strategic head would lead to greater benefits.  That being said, of course a great movie with Elsa leading would be the best option."

Yeah, there was when Frozen Fever first premiered, and it was especially prevalent when the first bits of it were unveiled. It was just the fandom overreacting really, but it seems to be a minority now at least to my knowledge. As I stated in my comment, Frozen Fever was actually a good depiction of her character because it provided us with a glimpse of what Elsa has learned after the events of the first film. She accepted her mistake and learned to improve upon that rather than conceal it like she normally would."

But to address the concerns you brought up in your post, it could be risky to further develop her character and her story from a legacy standpoint, but I'm not sure how much Disney cares about that or if Elsa's legacy even can be tarnished at this point. Horrible sequels that ruin beloved characters have never had a lasting negative financial impact on a franchise (as far I know). Even the prequels didn't ruin Star Wars. However, it's possible that Elsa may be a special case.  I don't think people will suddenly stop buying Frozen merchandise just because they didn't like Elsa's character in Frozen 2, they'll just further cherish who she was in the first movie. And I don't think Disney wants to turn Frozen into a franchise that releases a new movie every few years, so sullying her character in the sequel won't affect future installments of the franchise, because there won't be any. If I were Disney management, the only thing I'd want from Frozen 2 is for Elsa to wear at least 5 new dre$$e$.

To point out examples , going by superheroes, we have Batnipples that absolutely killed Batman during the 90s , Or spiderman 3 and his dance killing the planned spiderman 4, or the amazing spiderman 2 that forced Sony to Ally with marvel. If the movies are recognized and actually ruin the characters and the storylines, the franchise can suffer a lot, and those only re-surged in new ways because they have the comics and historic support, advantages that Frozen doesn't have.   I don't think people will suddenly stop buying Frozen merchandise just because they didn't like Elsa's character in Frozen 2, they'll just further cherish who she was in the first movie. And I don't think Disney wants to turn Frozen into a franchise that releases a new movie every few years, so keeping her character unsullied in the sequel won't negatively effect future installments of the franchise, because there won't be any. If I were Disney management, the only thing I'd want from Frozen 2 is for Elsa to wear at least 5 new dre$$e$.   Actually yeah, if the movie is bad people would stop caring about Frozen the same, which in the end would just weaken the franchise and weaken the sales. You don't buy stuff you didn't like or care about. You buy the awesome stuff.    But if WDAS wants to make the best movie they possibly can, then they can't be afraid of using their greatest asset. No guts, no glory.   While this is true, it might be surprising and Anna gets to be the best possible usable character, would be a nice surprise perhaps, although the wonder of what if Elsa was given the spotlight would always be there."

I expect Frozen 2 to be the only sequel of the Frozen franchise. I really don't think Disney wants to get bogged down making a new Frozen movie every few years, even if it is a cash cow.

So I don't see why a bad Frozen 2 would ruin Frozen in the minds of those who watch it.   It was easy to realize they were just filler and none of them were major deliverings really, and they didn't ruin the characters, their stories were just dumb. A lot of people don't even take them as canon. Frozen 2 will come from WDAS, be released a few years after Frozen shook the entire world on theaters. While I don't expect people will stop loving ""Frozen"" the movie itself, the perception will clearly be different than if it was just a random vid  sequel and it will damage the franchise.   It is relevant to your point because your point requires a third installment for it to be valid. And those examples would be irrelevant given the assumption that Frozen 2 would be the only sequel.

So unless Disney is banking on more installments, I don't see how a bad sequel could ruin the franchise, anymore than a bad direct-to-video sequel could.   Not at all, you asked what other chars were ruined and thus hurt their franchises, I responded with examples that were easy to follow, never meant that Frozen was going for another installment.  This won't hurt the sales of the original, but the sales of the original won't be thriving anymore on the first place. Disney is making the sequel and investing to make money out of it. I wouldn't say it's unlikely there will be other sequels but that is irrelevant. Frozen 2 will be important for Disney they need to cash out of it, not Frozen 1, Frozen as a franchise transcends the first movie.  Not only that but a bad sequel for Frozen , their strongest franchise , would hurt possible future sequels they have planned as people would have way less confidence on WDAS.  Once again The perception between a major theatrical release and direct-to-video sequels, considering the reach, marketing, investment and wahtnot, is vastly and obviously different.   Frozen 2 will likely have success by virtue of being the sequel to Frozen. It would be nice if Frozen 2 was actually good and sold a lot, but it won't ruin the franchise if it isn't/doesn't.   I disagree, the whole reason of it's existence is extending the Frozen brand's life. Regardless if Jen and Chris had an story to tell or not. Saying that it won't matter how good it is, specially if there's no other major releases expected, is a blind statement pretending Disney is doing a null creative and commercial move by creating the sequel.

Frozen,3by124,dragongt1994,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"I think we might be looking at this from different alternatives.   The alternative I'm working from is ""there's no sequel"".  The alternative you're working from appears to be ""the sequel is awesome"".  Of course a bad sequel will have a negative financial impact compared to a good sequel. My point is that there is nothing the sequel could do that would make the franchise financially worse than it's current state and outlook. Frozen 2 won't negatively impact the franchise financially unless it doesn't break even.   Masses won't just blindly consume something that falls off.   Yes they well. We've seen many examples of this. People will pay to watch a horrible sequel just out of curiosity if they liked the first one. The Lost World and Jurassic Park III, MIB 2, Stranger Tides and arguably every Pirates of the Caribbean movie after the first, all the transformers sequels, and Star Wars Episodes 1-3 just to name a dozen. Even Jurassic World benefited from the original that was released 22 years ago. It would be difficult to argue that the $200+ million Jurassic World made in it's opening weekend was because of good reviews and word of mouth.  Edit: SGPFC"
Frozen,3by124,paspartuu,2,Fri Jul 3 18:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the alternatives bit.   You wouldn't have a nominal loss, true what you have sold is still there, you'd have a loss in terms of cost of opportunity. Which is a big loss given that Frozen 2 is not only an investment on terms of actual monetary output.  And yeah people will watch a sequel even if it's bad, that's true, that's not what I mean. What i mean is, they won't buy the 12 new dresses you put there if the movie is hated and falls to obscurity."
Frozen,3by124,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, ""Does a bad Frozen sequel financially hurt the franchise if the alternative is no sequel at all?"". I think the answer is no, unless the sequel fails to break even, as opposed to ""Does a bad Frozen sequel financially hurt the franchise compared to a good sequel?"", to which the obvious answer is yes, since a good sequel will make more money than a bad sequel (at least that's the theory). We're comparing the hypothetical bad sequel to different alternatives (no sequel vs good sequel), which is why our perspectives initially seemed incompatible, when in fact, they are not.

Cars 2 is the only poorly reviewed Pixar film, and the first one wasn't well liked either, but that franchise continues to be a cash cow for Disney and Pixar because of toys and other merchandise, which is probably why Cars 3 is currently in development. If the Cars franchise is any indication, Frozen 2 might not have to be good for it to sell new dre$$e$. I guess any movie franchise can be a cash cow as long as it appeals to that special demographic, regardless of how much it doesn't appeal to every other demographic."

But I do have an idea if how Prince Hans could have a huge chunk of the story. While Frozen II should be headlined by Queen Elsa, Prince Hans's redemption would make for a fantastic supplementary plotline. Frozen II has potential to be the best redemption tale ever told- even the actors portraying the character seem to agree!  Queen Elsa deserves a wardrobe more diverse than Princess Anna's tiresome shades of tranquil green (seriously, what were the directors thinking?) or Princess Tiana's non-amphibian fashion. Every time it is a new day, have a costume change. Add a few showstopping formal gowns for major Princess commercialism, but throw in some casual pieces! Don't limit her to ice crystal material- put her in fabrics of the muggles or hybridize! And just because it's the nineteenth century doesn't mean a magical maiden in a sparkling dress with a slit skirt must keep to those guidelines. We wanna see more leg! More bosom! Don't neglect hair or make-up while you're at it! Like in the original, have her hair express her mental state!"

I thought it meant fashion that doesn't make you look like a frog, so I imagined Tiana in a huge green frog-like waterproof dress and wondered when she ever wore that in the movie. Anyway, ""non-amphibian"" might be my new favorite adjective.  And yes, Elsa needs a much bigger wardrobe. More casual, more formal, more skimpy, more elegant, etc.  Edit: SGPFC"

But then again, the only direct advice Pabbie did give was to remove all magic from Anna's life and her memories, which is terrible advice. So maybe Pabbie would've just agreed with the king's plan if he decided to discuss the issue further."
Frozen,3bwp22,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"This is what Gran Pabbie says when he displayed that image of Elsa performing magic: ""There is beauty in your magic."" He was showing the beauty her power could bring. He's not predicting the future. Then he says: ""But also great danger,"" and he shows a magenta silhouette of a mob attacking Elsa. Gran Pabbie isn't predicting the future. He is just saying there are two scenarios that can occur in Elsa's life depending on her ability to control her powers and not give in to fear. By the end of the film, Elsa is able to display the beauty of her magic and not get attacked by a mob.   The image he showed her was exactly what happened in the epilogue.  The silhouette even looked like her in her ice dress with her hair in a braid.  Yes, he also showed an image of a mob attacking her, but those were two different things.  The first one was a vision of the future, the second was meant to convey his point that ""fear (of yourself) will be your enemy"", cause if she fears her powers she can't control them, and if she can't control them that could in fact lead to others fearing her and turning on her.  Of course that message was taken completely the wrong way, and I don't know why Pabbie thought an image of an angry mob attacking Elsa would be interpreted any other way in that moment, but that's another discussion.   I think Gran Pabbie could have discussed the issue further with the king. Obviously, it wasn't gonna be his final decision what they do, but he could have given more input.

So maybe Pabbie would've just agreed with the king's plan if he decided to discuss the issue further.   How do you know Pabbie didn't discuss it further with Agnarr?  The scene cut away with Agnarr saying that they would lock the gates, reduce the staff etc, but the conversation might have been longer than that.  Also removing all magic and memory of magic did work, it's just that they shouldn't have been isolated and once Anna was old enough and Elsa had control Anna should have been told about Elsa's magic again.  I'm not saying Pabbie is blameless in all this, because he could have conveyed his point (fear will be your enemy) in a better way, but Elsa's parents weren't completely right either."

Frozen,3bwp22,ArendelleKnight,3,Thu Jul 2 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, bored, so just feel like jumping in here.   I don't think that was an image of the future at all, more like Pabbie showing what could be a good thing and Disney just dropping hints or being lazy on the silhouette.   It's interesting because that was major foreshadowing as both events depicted in the mist actually came to pass. The beauty being the epilogue, and the mob representing the coronation party and possibly even the summit siege.   In any case I think Granpabbie did meant both internet and external fears (which are both, problems in the movie). Because let's be honest, people would fear her if she controlled her powers since the beginning as well, perhaps even more in some cases, Elsa is just unnatural. So the fear of the people would be a problem for her anyway.   I am sure he meant fear in general. Yeah, it's natural for people to express fear of the unknown, but if she were to take a subtle approach over a span of several years she could probably convince the population that she means no harm whatsoever. Besides, wouldn't you want a benevolent queen who could lay waste to any country who threatens the sovereignty of the kingdom? I understand many people can be cynical about their monarch, especially with something as confounding as this since the implications are absolutely staggering both positively and negatively. I think the pros outweigh the cons here though.   I think they were gonna tell her after their trip, at least from what we read on A Frozen Heart, when the King promises a family trip I think they would finally talk about Elsa's magic and that's how they would take the girls with them on a trip trusting Anna would help them keep Elsa under control this time too. Too bad they died.   Likewise here. I imagined they would have waited at least until she came of age when they would finally reveal the truth to her."

The silhouette even looked like her in her ice dress with her hair in a braid.   Gran Pabbie still showed the angry mob attacking right afterwards though, so it's more reasonable for me to believe that he was saying both were possible scenarios rather than just predicting one is destiny, the other just a possibility.   How do you know Pabbie didn't discuss it further with Agnarr? The scene cut away with Agnarr saying that they would lock the gates, reduce the staff etc, but the conversation might have been longer than that.   I don't know for sure, but that's why these are just theories. Also, I did mention in my last comment that if the king and Pabbie did have more conversation, Pabbie probably would've ended up agreeing rather than reluctantly conceding, at least with the general idea of the plan of keeping Anna away from Elsa and her magic. That ""conceal don't feel"" shit the king came up with was really the worst though. I don't think Pabbie would've liked that at the very least.   Also removing all magic and memory of magic did work, it's just that they shouldn't have been isolated and once Anna was old enough and Elsa had control Anna should have been told about Elsa's magic again.    Are you saying Elsa and Anna shouldn't have been isolated from each other? But isn't that part of removing all magic from Anna's life? If the two were together, since Elsa doesn't have full control, her powers would be revealed to Anna pretty quickly. At least that was the fear. Or are you saying they shouldn't have been isolated from the world? Knowing she doesn't have full control, Elsa's powers would most likely be revealed at some point if exposed to the outside world, and then Anna would probably hear about it.  The whole theme of the movie was love vs. fear using motifs such as open and closed doors to represent these two ideas. To keep Anna away from Elsa, they had to have Elsa's door closed, symbolizing that this entire plan was based more on fear instead of love. So maybe waiting until Anna is older sounds like a good plan, but in the process, you're kind of traumatizing both sisters, especially Elsa, who seems to grow more fearful of her powers the longer she stays cooped up.   Pabbie says that fear will be Elsa's enemy, yet his plan of removing all magic from Anna is an act of true fear, so he's contradicting his message with his actions. That's why I say Gran Pabbie is someone with much knowledge but little wisdom.  I'm about to workout right now and gotta go, so there's probably some holes in my argument that even I would have to admit."

Well obviously part of it would still involve keeping Anna away from Elsa when she's practicing her magic.  What would be the point in removing all memory of magic just to immediately reveal that secret to her again?  I don't think Pabbie would have been supportive of separating them completely though, cause how they handled the whole situation just ended up feeding Elsa's fear and making the situation worse.  She didn't actually start losing control (her aim was just off in her panic about Anna falling) until she started fearing herself.   Are you saying Elsa and Anna shouldn't have been isolated from each other? But isn't that part of removing all magic from Anna's life?

I'm saying they shouldn't have been separated, and also as I said before Elsa never did lose control until after they were separated.  Pabbie removed Anna's memory of Elsa's magic, (or rather altered those memories) but once Elsa realized she could control it they could have let Anna know again and her and Elsa could have just been more careful when playing with her magic.   The whole theme of the movie was love vs. fear using motifs such as open and closed doors to represent these two ideas.

Yeah, one of the events did happen while the other didn't. I interpreted Gran Pabbie's little presentation as him showing two possible scenarios in Elsa's future. In the end, one of them came true, but he didn't straight up predict that would happen. He just said that as long as Elsa learns to control her powers and doesn't give in to fear, the beauty of her magic will shine. If she doesn't, angry mob.  I agree with your point that Elsa does not not lose control until after she was separated from Anna. It would have been useful information for the parents and Gran Pabbie, but they just assumed Elsa lost control when she struck Anna. I also agree that Pabbie wouldn't condone the parents' actions if he got to see what they were doing to Elsa.   Keeping them separate at all is a huge part of what's making it difficult for Elsa to control her magic because the separation is a decision based on fear. Love is what allowed Elsa to thaw the winter. Elsa's ability to control her powers are based on the quality of her emotions, and as long as she's completely separated from Anna, she's going to be fearful just being near Anna. So that's kind of why I like your idea that they should've just keep Anna away from Elsa only when she's practicing magic. That would leave more love in Elsa's life, and it would make it easier to learn eventually that love and positive emotions are what's needed to gain control.   Removing all magic from Anna's head was how he healed her. An act of true love thaws a frozen heart, and the cure for a frozen head has to do with your mind.   And the mind can more easily be persuaded. Pabbie's idea to remove all magic from Anna's life and memories was just a recommendation: ""I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe."" The fact this was just a recommendation made to be safe tells me there could have been other ways to heal Anna's head. Wisdom is applying your knowledge and experience to make sound decisions and actions. The method he used to cure Anna wasn't the best choice he could've made, and the advice he gives ends up leaving Elsa and her parents more paranoid. So he didn't show much wisdom in his decisions. Gran Pabbie is not totally responsible for the actions the parents took, but he gave them an incentive to act on fear. Even in telling them to avoid fear, they just started to fear fear itself."

It could be taken as two possible scenarios, but I didn't see it that way with the mob turning into exaggerated looking monsters with evil eyes and sharp teeth before attacking her.  Either way if it wasn't in any way a look at the future why did the first scenario happen exactly even right down to her ice dress and her braid?   I agree with your point that Elsa does not not lose control until after she was separated from Anna. It would have been useful information for the parents and Gran Pabbie, but they just assumed Elsa lost control when she struck Anna. I also agree that Pabbie wouldn't condone the parents' actions if he got to see what they were doing to Elsa.   Yeah, and Elsa did believe that she lost control, that it was her fault.

Hey man, you never know what could've happened if fear completely took over Elsa and all of Arendelle. But seriously, I'll just interpret that as one scenario is much more likely to happen than the other one, but we really really don't want the other one to happen. Pabbie may have some future predicting powers, but I don't think his visions ever carry 100% certainty. It's probably a real downer when he sees the darker timelines because the dude always looks so desperate and uncertain in the two times we see him give advice.   There was another way to heal her, an act of true love. Really it stands to reason that all Pabbie did was stop the spread of the ice. It was a treatment, but not a cure, cause her white streak only went away after her act of true love thawed her frozen heart.   And that's why Olaf is the much better love expert. Olaf carries more wisdom with much less knowledge.  Overall, I agree with most of your points. It's all just a question of how much Pabbie actually knows given that his advice directly leads to all the bad and wrong decisions the characters make. Is it all a part of his plan for them to make mistakes? I definitely don't think the ruined childhoods of Elsa and Anna were, so drawing from that, why should I think he had the foresight to know Anna chasing a true love's kiss twice would lead to her sacrifice, which would then be her act of true love? Oh well, this was just a half baked idea anyway. I don't actually care that much about Gran Pabbie, so I don't hold my theory that sacred, but it was interesting to talk about nonetheless."
Frozen,3bwp22,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jul 3 06:19:21 2015 UTC,"Precisely this!  I've expressed those thoughts before, that granpabbie didn't say exactly ""as long as you love your family your powers will be  easy to control"" or ""love will cure if Anna gets Frozen again because seems the little shit is always in trouble"". Because he knew they needed to discover what love was and see it working into some kind of shock as prove. Like learning by experience rather than theory.  They couldn't take it for granted, they needed the experiences that would finally free them. I mentally support this with the fact that Elsa's powers grew problematic as she grew older, and she would've had accidents all the time anyway which would've diminished her confidence, however learning it by experience once she had completed her development (or almost) seems much more functional for them."

Frozen,3bunfp,Chris857,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"I agree everything you said. Frozen 2 would risk if Elsa was  protagonist. Now she really happy with Anna and her friend, Kristoff, I can't really see much that Elsa can develop? her power? ok, that's good, romantic love? um.. sounds more like princess Anna than our beloved Queen Elsa, OOC if I must say. and of course, will ruin the first message in Frozen 1.   To be honest, I do believe Disney would like to continue Elsa and Anna story like Frozen 1. a new trial for family love, perhaps?   For example: Elsa was orphaned (she was no longer to be Queen of Arendelle anymore, but don't worry, our beloved Elsa still be Queen of Snow and Ice, so don't worry about her title), her real mother was new antagonist, she try to take Elsa away from Arendelle and stole the ice powers or she brainwashed Elsa and using her to fight Anna/Arendelle? (I actually want to watch evil Elsa versus brave Anna with a heart of gold). Can Anna and Kristoff bring Elsa come back with them and save Arendelle? When Elsa awake, who will she protect? her sister or her mother? someone sacrificed their life to save Aredelle (maybe Anna? or Elsa will sacrifices her life to make the antagonist realize about the family love? and then, Elsa was cured by the family love. Afterward, Elsa and Anna decide the antagonist become their mother, and with everything Elsa did for the kingdom, she'll come back at her place, Queen of Arendelle and she still is Anna sister no matter what.

It's always the same and basically makes the character step back to the background while some other more fun characters do something fun. It also ruins previously good character more often than not by making them unsufferable. But, that concerns only toddlers and pregnancies. If Anna's child is like 5 y.o already, then it can work just fine. But I doubt we'll see any of that since people will complain a lot because Anna is only 19."

Frozen,3bv7kq,XNinja2017,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Well having Elsa hanging out with the baby/toddler may give us more dimension to her. How she hangout with the child may reveal what she did during her childhood. For example,if the child was scared, Elsa would then tell a story of how she tries to quell her fears during those years of isolation and fearing herself. Elsa would try her best to have at least reexperience those lost years with Anna with this child."
Frozen,3bv7kq,deathstrike86,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"You seem to think that a baby would lead to a great story. But a baby on its own can't do that. A great story requires conflict. If a baby leads to a conflict, like Elsa feeling abandoned by Anna, then a great story could result. If the baby doesn't create conflict, then all it's going to create is poopy diapers, and that's not fun."
Frozen,3bv7kq,potato-table,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:49:15 2015 UTC,It doesn't need to be a main conflict more of story flavor. It adds character touches that would flesh them out a bit more. The baby may have minor role as mainly supporting and showing how our characters changed.
Frozen,3bv7kq,KingJackFrost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"That's fine if the story is long and with plenty of space for character development, like a 100,000 word novel. And it would be fine if Frozen 2 were going to be a TV series. But a movie just isn't long enough to spend that kind of time on a baby unless the baby is vital to the plot."

I can't help you get your brother back, not even close, and I don't have any recommendations for fanfic that would be appropriate.  I'm writing to say one thing: When my friend died, there was a while where I felt like everything had changed for me, and I felt like nobody else understood. Someone I had seen every day was just gone. At any moment I thought she might walk in the door. And yet, most people – all the people who hadn't known her – were the same as before, and it made me lonely.  Some people will tell you to get over it, or that time heals all wounds, or other stupidity. No, the pain never gets better, you just get used to it. What I want you to know is, there are people out there who understand. Not perfectly, because everyone's experience is unique. But talk to everyone, and I really mean everyone, old and young, people you know well and people you don't, and if you can get grief counseling, do it. You'll find someone who understands.

Elsa absolutely despises Hans, since he wanted both her and Anna dead and nearly succeeded in his plan.  Because of this, the projectile would do quite a bit of damage.  It would hit Anna in the head, but luckily she has a thick skull - just like Krostoff.  She'd get two black eyes and a broken nose.  Elsa would immediately apply ice to the injuries to minimize the swelling.   Would you laugh? a lot?   Yes, but it's okay because Anna would also start laughing as soon as the shock wore off.

Frozen,3brgi6,HeimrArnadalr,2,Wed Jul 1 22:30:00 2015 UTC,Seconded.  Although personally I found the short to be a little too deep in the uncanny valley.

I had to watch it twice too, cause about 30 seconds after the actual movie started the power went out.  They got the movie going again like 15 minutes later, but they had to start from the beginning of the short."

Frozen,3bqbgf,potato-table,3,Thu Jul 2 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"What surprises me most about the current tally is that Frozen doesn't have a huge lead over Sleeping Beauty. The choice is obvious, I think: Sleeping Beauty is (despite the gorgeous animation) kinda boring. And since Internet polls are popularity contests anyway and Frozen is more recent, I expected it to have like 80% of the votes, like Finding Nemo, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin, and Cinderella have against their competitors. Instead, it's 55% to 45% – awfully low.  Are we all weird for liking Frozen so much?"

Frozen,3bqbgf,nairblizard,5,Wed Jul 1 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Really? that has never been my experience, for what I've seen on most places, either Frozen is seen as a high tier movie or hated to oblivion."
Frozen,3bqbgf,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"As weird as it sounds, I don't think our observations are mutually exclusive. The people who hate on Frozen the most can, and sometimes do think it's a decent movie. They just can't stand it's popularity and the people who insist that it's the greatest Disney movie ever made (even though they admit to not having watched many Disney movies), and so become vocal about it's flaws in order to balance the overwhelmingly positive opinions they see by rabid fans and establishment media.  I think the people who are most vocal about it tend to be at the extremes, and those people are drawn to and tend to comment in forums and posts that are about Frozen. Based on my experience with people I've talked to in real life, the comments in forums where it comes up casually in conversation (i.e. not prompted by the content or question in the post), and review sites that allow user reviews (e.g. IMDb), most people think it's good, but not great, and they don't understand why the movie is so popular.  Edit: AC, SGPFC"
Frozen,3bqbgf,Demian_Dillers,3,Wed Jul 1 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can understand the more neutral people not being very vocal about it on any side. Seems however most places were a Frozen image or something appears it receives praise and is recognized  as standing above others.  The OUAT fandom for example was really exited about Frozen way before the season. RL experience and facebook posts among others, have also shown me people praise Frozen above other movies, so I suppose out experiences differ although as you say, they aren't really exclusive."
Frozen,3bqbgf,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"My selections:   Up>Mulan. Loved Mulan, but I'll give it to Up because only Mulan's songs seem to age well with me. Up was memorable for its first ten minutes, while the remainder of the movie is just good, but not super excellent.  Wall-E>Pinocchio. Other than ""When you wish upon a Star"", I don't really have much to add to Pinocchio. Wall-E just seemed more relevant and the environment design is bleak yet astoundingly beautiful.  TS3>Cars. No competition because I was never really a cars person. Toy Story 3 is a fun one, though I will admittedly say that I wasn't really moved much by it.  TS>Snow White. All I want to erase from my head is Snow White's annoying voice. Toy Story was a birth of my generation of animated films, and I will stand by to defend it.  Inside Out> Finding Nemo. Inside Out is my favorite Pixar film as of yesterday. I am aware that saying this can be a crime, but there was just something so honest, truthful, and genuine about the characters/emotions in ""Inside Out"". These different metaphors put into creative design is just fantastic. While I do love Finding Nemo's adventure, the emotions just didn't chime the same way Inside Out does. I am also disappointed at this match-up, because Inside Out is new and not a lot of people have seen it yet, giving Finding Nemo a pretty big advantage.  Princess and the Frog>Robin Hood. Princess and the Frog had a much more interesting setting IMO, and as a fan of Jazz music, this one is a good treat.  BH6>Pocahontas. Pocahontas had fantastic songs, but I love the coming-of-age idea that I'm seeing in Big Hero 6, and I definitely enjoyed the comic relief of BH6 more than Pocahontas.  Mermaid>Hercules. I haven't watched both for a long time but I wasn't keen on the Baptist church choir songs in Hercules. Mermaid on the other hand, had some pretty awesome songs despite Ariel's ridiculous intentions.  Beauty and the Beast>WIW. I love both so much. Wreck-it Ralph is just so creative in its environment designs and the characters are so nicely modeled and developed, but when it comes to being more memorable and charming, Beauty and the Beast gets and edge for both characters and its wonderful music.  Abstained from Bambi VS. TLK because I'm really not interested in either of them. Sorry TLK fans for the crime I have committed.  Lady and the Tramp.>Monsters Inc. Not an animals person, but Lady and the Tramp's got some scenes that just makes it quite great. Monsters Inc., in retrospect, didn't strike me as a resonant movie.  Abstained from Peter Pan VS. The Incredibles because frankly I wasn't really into either of them. I'm very impartial about these two.  Aladdin>Alice in Wonderland, even though Alice in Wonderland was really delightful to watch. Aladdin wins this one because of its phenomenal songs.  Frozen>Sleeping Beauty. Easy choice for me because I really don't enjoy the earlier Disney princess movies. Frozen's character stood out to be much more memorable and different.  Cinderella>Brave, because I felt like Brave was far too assertive when it came to how they were telling the message, and it feels a bit obnoxious at times. Cinderella is just right in the tame zone and quite harmless.  Tangled>Fox and the Hound. Mainly because I'm not a big animals person, but don't let that stop anyone from watching it. They're both decent though, to be blunt."
Frozen,3bqbgf,CarterDug,2,Wed Jul 1 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"Yay, a vote for Frozen!  I liked Cars; I was sad to see it lagging behind so much :/"
Frozen,3bqbgf,CarterDug,2,Wed Jul 1 09:35:45 2015 UTC,"Up > Mulan. People who say that Up is only valuable due to its first ten minutes must rewatch the film again. While the film does not get to the same level of quality most of the time, it is still a phenomenal piece of imagination and character writing. Mulan... does not have that.  Pinocchio > WALL-E. This one was hard because I love both of them to death, but I went with Pinocchio since it is canonized as a contender for best animated film of all time, whereas WALL-E still is not. I cannot think of any flaw that Pinocchio has, to be honest.  TS3 > Cars. No contest.  Snow White > Toy Story. Hard as well, since both of them are extremely influential, but I believe Snow White makes a more powerful use of cinematic language, which is more important to me.  Inside Out > Finding Nemo. Loved Inside Out, and it is probably my favorite Pixar film at this point.  Princess and the Frog > Robin Hood. PatF is actually a pretty good film! The script is at times unfocused, but it is no worse than Robin Hood, and the production values of PatF settle the match for me.  BH6 > Pocahontas. I am not a fan of either of them, but BH6 offers at least some thematic sophistication  The Little Mermaid > Hercules. Not even a contest. It is more influential, it has better art direction, and it is just... better.  Beauty and the Beast > Wreck It Ralph. I like WiR fine, but Beauty and the Beast is almost flawless. Great art direction, great acting, solid thematic cohesiveness, great characterization. It is just a gorgeous film.  Bambi > The Lion King. Not a fan of The Lion King, and Bambi is a masterpiece in my eyes, so yeah. Bambi, easy pick.  Monsters Inc. > Lady and the Tramp. Not a fan of either of them, but Monsters Inc. was more creative than Lady and the Tramp.  The Incredibles > Peter Pan. The Incredibles has more thematic depth, and that is enough for me to vote for it.  Alice in Wonderland > Aladdin. Aladdin is recently falling out of favor with me, while Alice in Wonderland is rising in my books when looked at as a piece of experimental animation, so I will vote for Alice.  Frozen > Sleeping Beauty. The art direction in both films is crazy, and the quality of the animation is as well. However, Frozen has way more substance and a much better understanding of the cinematic language. Easily one of the best in Disney library.  Cinderella > Brave. From a critical standpoint, Brave > Cinderella, but I have a clash of viewpoints against Brave that limit my appreciation for that film.  Tangled > Fox and the Hound. Tangled is recently rising in my books... in fact, so much that it might overtake Frozen (which is funny, since at the beginning I thought that Tangled > Frozen, then the opposite happened and now I might go back to my original position). The story is just so friggin good, as is the quality of the direction in some scenes. The story in Fox and the Hound is also powerful, but I feel there are some decisions that drag the narrative."

Frozen,3bqjof,dragongt1994,3,Wed Jul 1 09:57:00 2015 UTC,"If Anna died in the first movie, what effect does it have in all the characters?    The only character that I can see impacted in any significant way is Elsa. Yeah, Kristoff grew quite attached to her at the end of the film, but he could have probably gotten over it easily. I always imagined that if Anna really died she would have developed a strong hatred for humanity and go into isolation once more. Oh, and the storm would never recede.   One of the plot holes in the movie I think I spotted is why the trolls didn't tell the true love was the cure for a frozen heart.    They did. Not in the beginning sure, but they did later in the film.   Having the frozen heart lethal would clear this plot hole   It was lethal. It's an ailment that slowly consumes your body over time converting your biological matter into nothing but solid ice over a matter of hours."
Frozen,3bqjof,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jul 1 10:08:23 2015 UTC,But they should said it in the beginning just incase such a thing happens. What I mean lethal is nothing could cure it
Frozen,3bqjof,XNinja2017,4,Wed Jul 1 10:15:32 2015 UTC,"But they should said it in the beginning just incase such a thing happens.   Indeed, but no one really displayed the best sense of competence in the film to be honest. Frozen was an incompetence extravaganza! It's especially quite prevalent in the start.   What I mean lethal is nothing could cure it   Yeah, you can't necessarily treat it or cure it via conventional methods, but true love qualifies as a cure (You know Disney, I would like an official comprehensive statement on how this works. Bulls*** magic is not a valid answer.)."
Frozen,3bqjof,doggie015,2,Wed Jul 1 10:23:20 2015 UTC,"True love causes the heart to beat more powerfully, generating more heat which in turn causes the ice to melt."
Frozen,3bqjof,Sylra,4,Wed Jul 1 12:26:09 2015 UTC,It would mean no thaw so I guess everyone will be freezing to death.
Frozen,3bqjof,mathspook777,3,Wed Jul 1 11:20:01 2015 UTC,"I had an idea that the frozen could have been a prequel to the snow queen book. However in that reality, Anna died."
Frozen,3bqjof,OrangeFeels,2,Wed Jul 1 11:25:29 2015 UTC,"This is a really good idea, but it would be hard to fit into Andersen's original story. The Snow Queen character is vital to the story, but she doesn't appear very often, and she doesn't play a very active role. Making her Elsa wouldn't change much. But telling the story from her perspective could be very interesting."
Frozen,3bqjof,CarterDug,2,Wed Jul 1 14:06:12 2015 UTC,I think she wasn't even that evil in the book. Maybe he kidnap the girl's brother and elsa observing the girl because she reminds her of anna. Maybe adjusting the story a bit having Elsa a more active role like occasionally talking to the girl.  Edit: Maybe even having this alternate Elsa invade the canon reality in attempt to resurrect her version of Anna. She would use the trolls for their magic because she would assume they were evil like in her reality

I have 2 fanfic concepts that explore this question. One of them is a Kristelsa fic.   The other takes place a couple hundred years after Frozen, though Elsa still looks the way she did in Frozen. The technology is similar to late 19th/early 20th century Europe. The world is full of sorcerers (1% of the population), but most of them are only powerful enough to be party magicians and street criminals. Truly powerful magicians are rare (0.01 % of the population), and Elsa is widely believed to be the most powerful in the world. The most powerful sorcerers fight in a war between the two dominant nations, except for Elsa. She is a total recluse, traveling aimlessly across the world in her flying ice castle. Although she mostly keeps to herself, her reputation strikes terror into the people and towns who see her castle. Her powers have become legendary, as has her reputation for immense cruelty.  Anyway, long story short (spoilers coming) it is revealed that long long ago Elsa had frozen her own heart so that she couldn't feel the heartache and guilt of killing her own sister. But doing so made her cold and indifferent to the suffering of others. It is a Frozen/Beauty and the Beast/Howl's Moving Castle crossover.  Edit: AC"
Frozen,3bqjof,CarterDug,2,Wed Jul 1 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"I also like the idea of Anna dying because how ironic it would be. How the most powerful person in the movie was saved by a normal girl. A person who strived to avoid killing someone inadvertedly caused it herself. Potentially the most powerful comes across as the weakest of the lot.Plus I like sad endings.   I don't know how would kristelsa would work here if all the events prior to this point was the same. In my opinion kristelsa would have worked if kristoff and elsa would have met before this event or kristoff and elsa hangout because of their relationship with Anna.   This event may have pushed elsa do the edge of crazy because it meant all those years of isolation was worth crap. Confirms that she is a killer and a monster in her mind. She pretty much becomes something else.  So freezing her heart seems to be a logical choice for a good story. but I would choose that she would stop trying to freeze her heart because she felt this as a punishment she was must endure.  To feel every heartache like ice that slowly consumes her soul. To have every memory haunt for the rest of her days.  She couldn't kill herself. Every time she tried, her powers prevent her. This powers are her prisons. She spends decades risking her life not because she wants to save people. But because she wants to die"

It's hard to say though because he/she never comments on anything but if he/she did see your video, you can bet you made that person smile.   Everytime I go to the DCInside Frozen Gallery, most the posts don't seem to have anything to do with Frozen. :[ it could just be me though."

Frozen,3bp4cc,Demian_Dillers,2,Wed Jul 1 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"this one is pretty cool, you don't often see Fever Elsa on her winter element."
Frozen,3bphce,Demian_Dillers,5,Wed Jul 1 02:40:13 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it wouldn't be a fun moment.  More like Anna has to ""prove"" her allegiance to some villain or evil alliance, and so she has to do something to hurt Elsa (even though she secretly hates doing it).  Elsa doesn't realize that Anna is putting on an act, so on an emotional level, it hurts her very deeply.  And even though she could easily kill Anna, she restrains herself, because although she really believes that Anna now hates her, she still loves Anna.  This is horrible.  I have to stop now."
Frozen,3bphce,LastUniqueUserID,3,Wed Jul 1 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"Aw, what if it's a joke. Like Anna is talking about the things she'd do to Hans and she's throwing punches into the air and stuff. She doesn't realize Elsa is behind her looking for something. And she turns around in a powerful punch to the air and BUM she hits Elsa in the face by accident, leaving her dizzy. Y'know, classic comedy."
Frozen,3bphce,LastUniqueUserID,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, I can see that happening.  But what if Elsa had an automatic defensive reaction and froze Anna, again.  But this time there's no going back.  Elsa's life is no longer worth living, so she voluntarily allows Hans to kill her.  Wait, I did it again!  Maybe I'm just in that kind of a mood."
Frozen,3bphce,LastUniqueUserID,3,Wed Jul 1 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"!!!  But then Kristoff saves her beating Hans and tells her there's a way to save Anna and that is , to Infuse the Frozen Anna with enough magic so she gains life. Eventually, Anna revives although her body is made of Ice now. Hey, the cold never bothered Elsa anyway and Ice is Kristoff's life, so everything is cool."
Frozen,3bphce,ArendelleKnight,3,Wed Jul 1 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll go with that.  I know if I add to it, I'll probably come up with a sad ending again!"

Frozen,3bphce,LastUniqueUserID,2,Wed Jul 1 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"Or...   The amount of control Elsa is revealed to have over her powers is not only vast, but also omnidirectional. She can freeze a country in a matter of minutes, but, when tempered by love, unfreeze it even quicker. So it stands to reason that if she were able to maintain control of her powers, she should be able to unfreeze Anna's head or heart just as easily as she froze them."
Frozen,3bphce,Schadenfreudenous,2,Wed Jul 1 04:45:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe, would be a cool thing to explore later."

Frozen,3bphce,ArendelleKnight,6,Wed Jul 1 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"Hans, Kristoff, Anna, and Elsa are trying to solve a mystery in an ancient temple. They discover a relic that randomly switches their bodies. While Hans is in Elsa's body, he insists on touching himself (Elsa's body). Elsa, in Hans's body, gets upset, and Anna punches Hans in Elsa's body. The punch proves to be fatal and Elsa's body dies from internal hemorrhaging.  Does that count?  If not, then Kristoff leaves Anna at the alter and professes his love for Elsa. Anna believes that Elsa purposely seduced Kristoff to ruin her wedding day. Elsa tries to explain that she wasn't trying to steal Kristoff or sabotage the wedding, and that she (Elsa) is just that much prettier and better than her (Anna). Anna punches her in the face.  Edit: AC, SGPFC"

Anna punches her in the face.   Proof that honesty is not always the best policy."
Frozen,3bphce,ArendelleKnight,3,Wed Jul 1 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Well... that first one is kind of extreme.  The second one, would be interesting to see Elsa just acknowledge how much better she is. Then she ruins Anna's dress and marries Kristoff right there, given everything is ready, taking him to her palace afterwards just to spite Anna for the punch."

Frozen,3bphce,Schadenfreudenous,2,Wed Jul 1 03:46:15 2015 UTC,The only scenario where that could possibly make sense in character is if Anna was under the influence of an evil mirror as in the original Snow Queen story or the Frozen arc on OUaT.  I don't think it would be a fun moment either.
Frozen,3bphce,Schadenfreudenous,2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"What if Anna is really, really hungry, and she has some cookies with chocolate chips stashed somewhere, she's DYING to get home and eat them. However that same day Elsa found them and ate them all!. Anna finds her stash ravaged and as she looks through the castle, she sees her sister eating the last cookie pretty happily. Anna gets really mad and lightly punches Elsa and then walks away Angry?.  Or as others have suggested, Elsa kind off loses restraint and end up with Kristoff right when Anna sees them. Elsa tries to explain herself but Anna punches them both."
Frozen,3bphce,falceeffect,2,Wed Jul 1 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see the first one happening and the second one even less so.  First of all neither Elsa or Kristoff would do that in the first place, but the only way Anna would intentionally hurt Elsa like that would be under the influence of the mirror."

But, as a real hero, she'd try to save everybody."

Frozen,3bl78f,mathspook777,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"Personal union:       A personal union is the combination of two or more states who have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct.   It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a federal state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union need not be a hereditary monarch.   Personal unions can arise for several reasons, ranging from coincidence (a woman who is already married to a king becomes queen regnant, and their child inherits the crown of both countries) to virtual annexation (where a personal union sometimes was seen as a means of preventing uprisings). They can also be codified (i.e., the constitutions of the states clearly express that they shall share the same person as head of state) or non-codified, in which case they can easily be broken (e.g., by the death of the monarch when the two states have different succession laws).  The Commonwealth realms, not addressed in the list of personal unions, are contemporary independent states that share the same person as monarch.

Frozen,3bl3lz,dragongt1994,12,Tue Jun 30 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"I am sure there is a lot of possibilities here. They both seem to have vastly different views when it comes to approaching a situation that I think dispute is inevitable. Once that ""honeymoon"" period is over, I can see them arguing a lot to be honest. Even over some of the most trivial things."
Frozen,3bl3lz,XNinja2017,8,Tue Jun 30 02:40:29 2015 UTC,"I think they'd probably argue a lot, but it would be mostly over minor things and they'd both get over it really quickly.  For instance, Anna would always want to set the thermostat warmer than Elsa.  Maybe they'd argue about how the firewood should be stacked too - bark side up or down."
Frozen,3bl3lz,LastUniqueUserID,8,Tue Jun 30 03:10:20 2015 UTC,Which one loves the other more.
Frozen,3bl3lz,gu1d3b0t,8,Tue Jun 30 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"I think they'd fight due to Elsa's overprotectiveness/shutting out tendencies or Anna's mischief/stubborness. I can see, and as numerous fanfics have shown, Anna could get pissed at Elsa's tendencies to keep all her problems to herself and reject help, as well as when Elsa is super paranoid, which I can envision to happen in the sequel if a threat to Arendelle is present. Elsa could get pissed at Anna's unsubtleness and tendency for trouble, and could get rightfully enraged if Anna disobeys her, especially if it threatens her safety."
Frozen,3bl3lz,mavisbangs,4,Tue Jun 30 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"Probably when Anna starts becoming way too touchy and invasive, when Elsa inevitably needs her space she could try to ask Anna and it could end bad.  Their personalities are opposites so they might clash on many things. Specially when Anna is irresponsible or when Elsa is plain restrictive."
Frozen,3bl3lz,Demian_Dillers,3,Tue Jun 30 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Since most people here already stated what I was gonna say, I'm just gonna be that guy and say that they're probably gonna inevitably fight over Kristoff, what with how things are going with Anna and Kristoff. Maybe down the road Anna will start neglecting her sister in favor for hanging out with him, and that could cause tension between the two sisters."
Frozen,3bl3lz,cyberdragon1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:06:28 2015 UTC,"I also think so too; especially that (most likely) Elsa would take issue with Anna and Kristoff getting more and more intimate as their relationship progresses, fearing that Anna might cause scandal and taint the royal name (take note that Frozen happened in the 1840s, courting is very strict and traditional, and premarital relations are looked down upon) so Elsa would not allow Anna to go on long dates and parties, especially into the night. of course Anna would think Elsa to be unnecessarily restrictive, and be angered for not trusting her enough, and would protest (maybe the cut dialogue of ""I may not be your mother but I'm still your Queen"" can make its way back into the script in this scenario)   another case scenario would be that as Kristoff and Anna's relationship progresses, Anna spends more and more time with Kristoff, leaving Elsa alone and bitter and hurt that her sister didn't give her priority anymore, and coupled with the threat of scandal which results in Elsa's restrictive rules upon Anna, and Anna's unwillingness to be held down, could result into a huge bitchfight. frankly, I wouldn't want this scenario because it is highly unlikely that Anna would just abandon Elsa like that for some boyfriend. I think I like my first scenario better, because at least their sister bond established strongly in the first film would still be intact."

Frozen's hate is based on pure hipsterism and nothing more.  EDIT: And I'm just so shocked at the reasons the haters give: ""it's too new"", ""it's not a classic,"" ""we didn't grew up with the newer movies"" like just because a disney movie is new doesn't mean it will never be a classic? the classic movies were new at one point, what makes Frozen so different? and the blatant hipsterness! ""it's too popular!"", ""it's everywhere!"", ""fans ruined it!"", ""it's overrated"", like omg get a grip."
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"Frozen's hate is based on pure hipsterism and nothing more.   Not always. I know some people who said that hate the movie not because they didn't like it, but because others liked it and they feel like they're missing out or don't get it."
Frozen,3biacr,Portgas,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Frozen's hate is based on pure hipsterism and nothing more.   C'mon now, you know this isn't true. While I am still a fan of Frozen, I think sometimes the fan base fails to recognize that there are legitimately people who didn't like it for their own personal reasons. Sometimes it just boils down to them not feeling the satisfaction they paid for - simple as that."
Frozen,3biacr,potato-table,3,Mon Jun 29 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Not the original commenter, but I think there's typically a difference between people who just didn't care for it because they didn't like the story/it didn't impact them emotionally/etc, and the people who feel the need to virulently hate and bash it because ""it's everywhere"" or ""it's too popular"" or whatever. I have no problem with the former group--there's not a single piece of media on the planet that pleases literally every person who consumes it, so if someone just didn't enjoy Frozen, that's their right. But I do have a problem with the ""hipster"" group, which seems to be much louder and more numerous, and also much more hateful."
Frozen,3biacr,Chisstastic,2,Mon Jun 29 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"maybe I generalized Frozen hate down to mere hipsterism, but you cannot deny that more often than not the rampant hate Frozen gets, especially in the internet, just boils down to hipsterism. many times have I seen haters hate on the film just because it's popular and thus never gave the movie a chance to try to connect, never try to view the film as unbiased as possible. most of the hate we see in the linked self post is this kind of hate."
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree.  Normally when you dislike something, you just dislike it, end of story, and don't attack people who do enjoy it or loudly wail about the thing existing. You can even really hate something, and still the normal approach is just to avoid and ignore the thing, maybe change the channel, scroll past the articles without clicking on them, you know. Maybe state that you were disappointed and don't recommend it, should someone ask.  But when people choose to spend a lot of their time ranting and whining and complaining and especially attacking people for daring to like the thing, when it becomes a sort of crusade, it gets weird. Like if they dislike it so much, why spend all that time focusing on it? Especially since Frozen isn't pushing or spreading harmful misconceptions or ideas like for example 50 shades of crap with it's false idea of BDSM.  And a lot of those people even admit they hate the film just because it's popular. As in they liked it a lot when they first saw it, but then it got ""too"" popular and now they can't stand it. Of course they'll try to come up with other excuses too, like ""it's too new"" or ""it doesn't deserve the attention"" (wtf, deserve? Popularity doesn't work like that) or then they try to nitpick on the flaws of the film (yet, there are a ton of even worse movies in the world, many popular, and these people just calmly ignore those movies, instead of getting angry because people dare to like movies that aren't flawless masterpieces of cinematic storytelling).  I don't get that attitude. I understand getting fed up with something or disliking it in the first place, but I don't understand how these people fail to grasp how the entertainment industry works. If there's money to be made, of course Disney will milk the cash cow for all that it's worth. ""It's unfair that Disney didn't dedicate more attention to BH6, Frozen had it's turn already!"" Seriously."
Frozen,3biacr,paspartuu,2,Tue Jun 30 14:03:57 2015 UTC,so if Tangled made it in....then what's stopping them from including Frozen in it? the Highest grossing animation of all time?   Frozen is a higher risk franchise so Disney probably doesn't want to mix it up with other stuff they don't have direct control yet. They might think it's more beneficial if Frozen's step into gaming come from their own hands.
Frozen,3biacr,Demian_Dillers,3,Mon Jun 29 17:07:04 2015 UTC,but..but...Square Enix does games better than Disney ever does!   I don't want Frozen limited to just Disney Infinity come on!
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"That's Disney's call :P, Disney seems to be evolving intro trying everything by themselves, keeping their most important franchises ""at home"" might be a priority. So who knows, I doubt Frozen will make it into KHIII, maybe IV though."
Frozen,3biacr,Demian_Dillers,6,Mon Jun 29 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"Favorite part from the thread.   Because like a lot of things, its the ""cool"" thing to hate.   I have a buddy who was growing up when The Little Mermaid was released. I've asked him about the craze. He says it was almost the exact same as the Frozen craze that had swept the nation when the movie was released. Merchandise as far as the eye could see, and people constantly hating on the film.  So yes, Frozen is the ""cool"" thing to hate. So was The Little Mermaid. Now look at the latter. It's regarded as the beginning of the Disney Renaissance.  Just give the haters their space, they'll all wind down in a few years.  EDIT: Spelling"
Frozen,3biacr,OrangeFeels,3,Mon Jun 29 17:14:57 2015 UTC,The craze over The Little Mermaid and other Disney films made me hate some of the things from them. It was awhile before I could listen to Under the Sea without muting it or Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King again. People on the internet just hate stuff for the sake of hating it. I'd guess at least 50% (pulled from the nether regions of my rear end) of the people hating on Frozen haven't even seen it. Ignorant hate is what is ugly.
Frozen,3biacr,10TailBeast,3,Mon Jun 29 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"That thread is really heartwarming. I agree with you djup; it's really nice to see other people defend it too~  On a side note as we discuss WDAS films making it into KH3, I'm surprised Wreck-It Ralph isn't in. Is he too obvious? Too American?"
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,3,Mon Jun 29 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"Wreck it Ralph didn't break out into the mainstream like many of the Disney movies the worlds of KH are based on. That is just what I noticed. And besides, WiR is the underdog of the new disney films when it comes to the KH fandom."
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"WiR is the underdog of the new disney films when it comes to the KH fandom   Because it fell under the radar? Now that you mention it, I don't remember it receiving the merchandise push Frozen and even BH6 got. Even /r/WreckItRalph is barren. It doesn't even have CSS :/"
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,3,Mon Jun 29 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"exactly? WiR, although a BO and critical success, went pretty underrated and forgotten in such a short span of time by the General Public. If what I heard is true, its merchandise didn't sell well, which dented further its exposure. I like WiR, and It's also a very obvious candidate for KH3, if not for its popularity, but for its setting (unless they can work their way around the meta aspect of video game characters IN a videogame world of videogame characters LOL that would be fun)"
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"It could break the tension to have Ralph remind Sora he's in a game, so I can see why he may never show up."
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,2,Mon Jun 29 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"and in extension, WiR as a whole. too bad :("
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 18:58:35 2015 UTC,Yeah. Does the tension make sense for a game featuring Disney characters?
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,2,Mon Jun 29 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"We still don't know the full line-up of worlds in KH3. So far only a few were confirmed, like Tangled and Olympus. I wouldn't be surprised if every WDAS cgi world ended up in the game."
Frozen,3biacr,Portgas,3,Mon Jun 29 16:50:42 2015 UTC,ugh how many times do we have to go back to Olympus??
Frozen,3biacr,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 29 16:58:35 2015 UTC,They just gotta have an arena. And what is the better place for it than Olympus?
Frozen,3biacr,Portgas,2,Mon Jun 29 17:16:47 2015 UTC,"But come on, are u not HYPED after seeing that fight with the rock titan??"
Frozen,3biacr,cyberdragon1,2,Mon Jun 29 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Could be worse.  Could be Agrabah.
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,2,Mon Jun 29 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hopefully. BH6 may be too new, though it depends on how close the developers are to Disney."
Frozen,3biacr,cyberdragon1,2,Mon Jun 29 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"There was a cancelled Kingdom Hearts Mobile game called Kingdom Hearts Fragmented Keys, and apparently WIR was supposed to be featured in that game, along with Frozen and other worlds as well. So there's still definitely a chance for it to make it in"
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,2,Mon Jun 29 18:07:40 2015 UTC,I remember seeing concept art of that! That's unfortunate :/ DO we know why it was cancelled?
Frozen,3biacr,cyberdragon1,2,Mon Jun 29 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows why it was cancelled, by the time they announced it they already cancelled it :/. It was probably an ambitious project that just didn't work out in the end"
Frozen,3biacr,Theroonco,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:47 2015 UTC,I guess making it for mobile added a few hurdles too :/
Frozen,3biacr,BunnykaPooey,3,Mon Jun 29 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"One of my friends told me that the plot of Frozen was too simple, where the main characters go up a mountain, just to go back down, and return home. It was obviously biased, for she said Tangled was better."
Frozen,3biacr,BunnykaPooey,2,Mon Jun 29 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"""Tangled was better"" are like the three words to make any Frozen fan despise you immediately"
Frozen,3biacr,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"I enjoy both films, but to have people hate on Frozen with bland reasons just irritates me."

I agree you can be a fan of something and criticize the hell out of it. For example I love the Kingdom Hearts franchise but have a ton of problems with it. It's usually the biggest fans that are the harshest critics because they see the faults more strongly and want to see it at its best."

Frozen,3bhwzt,Zook024,3,Mon Jun 29 13:06:04 2015 UTC,Well with Tangled already confirmed I gotta think there is a very good chance we will also see Frozen as well. The wait continues!
Frozen,3bhwzt,cyberdragon1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:20:17 2015 UTC,"It's kinda funny how recently the KH subreddit just posted a thread addressing on the massive hate that they have for Frozen. Seems like most people there just hate how overexposed it is, both merchandise and the songs."
Frozen,3bhwzt,scribe22557786,8,Mon Jun 29 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"Thoughts? I would actually love to hear all your issues/nitpicks with the film first.   A lot of people don't like ""Fixer-Upper"", myself included. I recognize that the sequence has to be there in order to make the movie work, but I just don't like the song.  I've seen complaints that boil down to people not liking how Hans has Bond Villain Stupidity, but again, the movie doesn't work if he makes sure to kill Anna rather than leave her to die. It's also awfully convenient that Olaf A) finds the room where Anna is dying and B) can pick a lock with a carrot. How he managed to get into a guarded castle with locked gates at all is entirely unexplained, but hey, he did respond with ""I will"" when Kristoff told him to stay out of sight.  A lot of the issues and nitpicks people have with the movie are like those, revolving around perceived plot holes and logical inconsistencies. Such things were inevitable given that ""Let It Go"" redefined the entire movie and came into the picture only 15 months before release. This thing was rushed out the door at breakneck speed, and that's going to mean a few things here and there don't add up. Jennifer Lee has all but said the way Grand Pabbie can choose what Anna does and doesn't remember is a narrative cheat made for expediency's sake.  I have argued and continue to argue that Frozen's power doesn't come from the plot but from the emotional truths it conveys. People make the wrong choices, yes, but they do it for entirely understandable and relatable reasons. What makes the events leading up to the climax so heartbreaking is that Elsa made so many choices over 13 years of her life to try to keep her sister safe from her powers, and yet her powers still end up killing Anna. Maybe logic says Elsa should have diffused the danger by telling Anna about the powers long before, but how many of us withhold things from our family, friends, and loved ones out of fear? Everyone does that.    Plus, Anna did everything we all are told is the right thing to do: she remained loyal to her sister, never gave up on her, and did all in her power to get Elsa in a good place again. Good, in theory. In practice, those actions manifest during the FTFTIF reprise as her pushing Elsa too hard (again), a panic attack in Elsa, her own fatal injury, and even more distance between the sisters. The right thing to do would have been to back off and give Elsa some space to process the realization that she blanketed Arendelle in winter, but Anna's dogged determination and optimism—which are admirable qualities—don't allow her to do so. Ever tried to do the right thing and end up in a bad spot anyway? Of course. Happens to all of us.  Giving every other example of wrong choices/actions done for the right reasons is a dissertation, not a comment. But you get the picture. The film has shortcomings that prevent it from being immune to criticism. It overcomes them, though, and that's what every piece of fiction has to try to do."
Frozen,3bhwzt,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 14:31:19 2015 UTC,One additional criticism is how unfleshed out arendelle is.
Frozen,3bhwzt,Portgas,4,Mon Jun 29 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, always welcome if it's substantial and well thought-out and isn't centered around your own feelings. ""It was boring"" and ""I didn't like that"" won't help anybody."

Frozen,3bhwzt,Ramza_Claus,2,Mon Jun 29 11:58:45 2015 UTC,"I would love to read your criticisms of Frozen! Even though I love it, I have some criticisms of it myself and I'm curious if you have seen some of the issues I've seen."
Frozen,3bhwzt,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 13:05:40 2015 UTC,Just not random trolling like saying this movie is sort of anti male crap or something
Frozen,3bhwzt,mathspook777,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"OK, here's a criticism: Act 1 is way tighter than acts 2 and 3.  Right up through Let It Go, the action has a tight, compelling feel almost like a good thriller. (With the possible exception of the opening ice harvesting sequence, which is more to set the tone than anything else.) From when Anna wakes up Elsa, their personalities push each other towards the confrontation that makes Elsa abandon her kingdom. It's really good storytelling.  And then everything slows down. Anna needs someone to take her up the North Mountain because she's been set up to be the kind of person who doesn't know how to do that on her own. She also needs a real love interest, someone whom she gets to know before trying to jump in the sack with. So we meet Kristoff. The scene with the wolves does nothing except build their relationship. Then we meet Olaf. He stands in for the sisters' relationship, but he doesn't advance the plot (until right at the end of the movie, when he saves Anna). There's an amusing but unnecessary rock climbing sequence which, again, does nothing but build Anna's and Kristoff's relationship.  Then Anna finally gets to Elsa and gets pushed away. Anna has grown as a character because she's really had to work to get to Elsa, but Elsa hasn't. She's stuck acting the same way she did before. The only thing that happens in the FTFTIF reprise is Anna getting struck in the heart. The reason why Elsa has to create Marshmallow is because if she doesn't, Anna would just stay there. The plot would grind to a halt while Anna needled Elsa into coming back.  Finally there's action again in act 3: Anna starts to freeze. But the freeze is gradual, and it doesn't become a major source of tension until the end. The visit to the trolls is just to push her and Kristoff closer together, again, not really necessary but it serves the overall goal of getting them hitched. Hans visits Elsa, but this does nothing for either of their character developments. Its only purpose is to get Elsa off the mountain so that she can participate in the denouement. The next thing to move the plot forward is when Hans reveals he's a bad guy. Olaf's visit to Anna is a real character building moment, and while it's not important to the plot, it is important to the story. But even near the end of act 3, there are unnecessary, failed attempts to build tension, like Sven falling into the fjord.  With all that said, I still think the movie is a success. Frozen isn't written as a thriller; there can and should be moments when we're not walking a tightrope. It's a character-driven movie. The first act happens to be driven very well, and the latter two not quite as much."
Frozen,3bhwzt,Xator_Nova,2,Mon Jun 29 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"I will argue that Anna meeting Kristoff and talking with him is thematically fitting, since someone needs to challenge her worldview. It also gives some characterization to Anna and Kristoff in a subtle way (the rock climbing scene also gives characterization to Anna, so it is not worthless).  I will say as well that Elsa changes during the FTFTIF reprise - but she reverts from the post-Let it Go euphoria to even more desperation, since she has to face the consequence of her actions.  I think that the point where the film comes to a sudden halt is when Olaf sings In Summer, but otherwise I dont see any filler. But yeah, the first half an hour was Disney at its best."
Frozen,3bhwzt,NinaWindia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there. Although I think the whole movie is great, that first half an hour up to after the let it go sequence is incredible. After that, the pace slows down somewhat."
Frozen,3bhwzt,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"kind of agree, the first act had it all. The great drama and great music"
Frozen,3bhwzt,yomamtte,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"As Xator_Nova points out, the rock climbing scene gives characterization, and I would add that it's not just of Anna. That scene perfectly illustrates the characters of Anna, Kristoff and Elsa, and also the importance of Olaf's role in the narrative.  Faced with an obstacle, Anna charges straight on (up?), with a focused determination bordering on recklessness. Kristoff is more levelheaded and cautious. He's also more willing to give consideration to how other people may feel - as he points out, how does Anna know that Elsa even wants to see her? It's a valid point, but Anna dismisses it out of hand, because she has not really grown or matured at this point in the story.  Then Olaf finds the stairway that leads straight to Elsa. This shows how Olaf, as the embodiment of the bond between the sisters, serves to bring them back together. It also foreshadows his unlocking of the door for Anna later in the story. Here, I'd like to add that Olaf doesn't just personify Elsa's understanding love as self-sacrifice. He also enacts Anna's ideal of love as opening up to one another. Both views are valid, and neither alone is enough. (One of the things I love about The Phantoms of Arendelle book is how well the author understands Olaf's role as an opener of closed doors.)  Lastly, the forbidding cliff represents the face that Elsa puts up against the world. On the face of it, all she wants is for everyone to stay away. But this is undermined by the fact that she left a (barely) hidden stairway that leads straight to her unlocked door, which shows that Elsa actually doesn't want to be alone.  I agree that the film's pacing and sense of cohesion suffers after Let It Go, but I don't think it contains any scene that doesn't serve to further the development of plot and/or theme in some way. (Okay, maybe In Summer, but even that number is not thematically irrelevant. ) Of course, how well a given scene serves this purpose is debatable. (For example, Fixer Upper contains an important message about love, but I think it's way too focused on shoehorning in the obligatory romance between Anna and Kristoff.)"
Frozen,3bhwzt,mavisbangs,2,Tue Jun 30 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"you can criticize the plot, story structure, themes, etc. just don't   go into a tirade on same-face syndrome / proclaim your hate purely for this very fact. anti-feminist, misandrist, anti-(insert political stance here) racism and whitewashing accusations cultural appropriation of Sami culture bullshit   because those are SJW bullshit and we do not tolerate SJW bullshit.  as for my criticisms, I just find act 2 too slow at times, and those trolls can just go die in hell :)"
Frozen,3bhwzt,CarterDug,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"The following is my opinion, but for simplicity's sake it will be presented as if it's not.  I have a lot of problems with Frozen, and many of them are the product of inconsistency in tone, pacing, design, and music. My biggest issue is how hard it panders to kids, which led to inconsistent tone and pacing throughout the movie and made it difficult for the film to build any rhythm or momentum.  It's almost as if the directors/producers were afraid to put something serious in the movie without putting something equally goofy in somewhere else to keep the tone lighthearted for the kids. You can't have a heavy first act without an equally goofy second act. You can't have an emotionally crushing number like Do You Want To Build A Snowman without an equally silly number like In Summer. You can't have a character like Elsa without a character like Olaf. Because some elements were so serious and others so goofy, it felt like they were from different movies. Even the character designs looked inconsistent. Olaf especially looks and acts like he walked onto the set from a different movie. In fact, the entire second act felt like a different movie from the first. The clashing between the serious elements and the ""cartoonishly"" goofy elements was so distracting that it made it impossible for me to enjoy the film.  The humor was incredibly intrusive, and the plot would often stop so that someone could make a joke (I'm looking at you Olaf!). All of this stop-and-go made it difficult for the story to build any rhythm or momentum, and the inconsistent pacing of story events didn't help either. The story had built up so much momentum through the end of Let It Go only to lose all of it because they spent what felt like half the movie on frivolous adventures with Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf. And the abrupt switching back and forth from serious to goofy made it impossible for the story to build emotionally. You can't have Anna getting struck in the heart, knowing the full consequences of such an event, then less than a minute later have Anna pick a fight with a giant goofy looking snowman, then immediately cut back to Elsa terrified and struggling to control her powers. And the sad thing is that movies don't have to be goofy or silly for kids to enjoy them.  One of the things I appreciated about Pixar's late golden age was that it never felt like their movies pandered to any demographic. It's as if Pixar had had so much success that it went to their heads, and they developed this sense of invincibility that translated into wildly ambitious ideas and more sophisticated storytelling. It was like they were saying with every movie ""We're going to make the best movie we can possibly make, and we don't give a fuck if your kids don't like it."" I really wish the Frozen team had taken that same approach.  I won't get into the music because I could probably break the character limit discussing just that one aspect.  Edit: SGPFC"
Frozen,3bhwzt,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 19:56:04 2015 UTC,I agree that the pandering to the kids was irritating but they're should still be light moments to offset the dark moment.
Frozen,3bhwzt,CarterDug,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:41:23 2015 UTC,I agree. Contrast is important. It makes the darks darker and the lights lighter. I guess I'm just not a fan of the way Frozen handled it after the first act. I thought the first act did a good job of balancing the serious moments with the lighter ones.  Edit: AC
Frozen,3bhwzt,mavisbangs,2,Tue Jun 30 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"I do not necesarily agree with your whole post, but I agree that the first act did a perfect job in regards to the execution of the plot. I agree that the movie could have been much better without the kid pandering elements (Olaf, Marshmallow chase scene, and the trolls) or have them kept at the very minimum, but I understand why they had to include these; kids are the target audience and the main consumer when it comes to merchandise (notice that most, if not all, of the purely dark and mature disney films in history were never popular in mainstream and in merchandise) I guess it's just because of how WDAS has developed itself before the public throughout the decades as an animation studio that is whimsical and highly traditional (which as a side effect is more kid friendly), whereas Pixar developed itself from the very start to be the more artsy and daring type (Pixar films may be too complex for young children). for each studio to try something that they weren't usually known for (e.g. Disney doing parodies/realistic stuff, Pixar doing musicals) can cause ""culture shock"" for the audience expecting a type of film from a studio. which is why I guess Wreck it Ralph, and many of the films from the Dark and Dork Ages of Disney, aren't as popular as, say, the princess and musicals, and why Pixar's Brave has mixed reception and a very troubled production."
Frozen,3bhwzt,CarterDug,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:19:51 2015 UTC,"The following is my opinion, but for simplicity's sake it will be presented as if it's not.  I understand that kids are the target audience and that merchandising is important for the long term success of a franchise, but I don't remember the pandering ever being so bad that the ""kid"" elements felt separate from the established universe of the movie and severely hindered the film's ability to progress the story.  Using WIR and BH6 as examples, WIR had extremely silly and goofy moments, but the movie established that tone early on, so it didn't feel like it diverged from the established universe. BH6 also had silly/goofy elements, but they were still plausible and made sense within that universe.  The closest example I can think of to tone breaking elements being introduced midway through a Disney film is the The Lion King (Spoilers coming). The first 40 minutes established a serious tone to the story with some well placed humor sprinkled throughout. Then Timon and Pumbaa were introduced. They too felt like they walked onto the set from a different movie, but, unlike Frozen, their involvement didn't brake the momentum of the story by distracting us from everything that happened previously. Simba's past was still very present during Timon and Pumbaa's 6 minutes scene with him. And as Simba learns to forget/ignore his past, we cut to a scene that shows the consequences of him running away, then we cut back to Simba to show that, despite being far from his problems, they still weigh heavy on him, and this scene then transitions to Rafiki discovering that Simba is still alive. The weight of his past is never ignored, the story kept moving forward, and the transitions from light to dark/dark to light were properly motivated throughout this entire intermediate sequence.   After Hakuna Matata, which ends on a lighter note, we transition to Zazu humorously singing in a cage (light to light transition), but the desolate condition of Pride Rock preps the audience for the scene to take a darker turn, which it does when we see Scar's tyrannical rule and the devastating effect it has had. The scene ends on a well placed humorous note to transition back to Simba and a loud burping noise. A conversation about the stars subtly reminds the audience of Simba's troubled past, and that subtle reminder further helps transition to a heavier tone as Simba reminisces about his father and is overwhelmed by the guilt of his past, even as Timon and Pumbaa's laughter remain paradoxically dominant. It's a beautiful and powerful scene that ends with Simba collapsing on the ground and rustling debri into the air, which is eventually captured by Rafiki. The passing of distance and time helps to soften the transition from heavy to light, but since Rafiki is associated with Simba's past, it's a fitting transition that doesn't ignore, but rather embraces the scene prior to it and the emotional weight that had accumulated throughout the movie. I know this sub hates comparisons, especially with TLK, but that's how you properly switch gears from light to dark/dark to light.  I'm not necessarily asking for darker movies, but better executed movies that can incorporate both darker and lighter elements without pandering to kids. TLK (for the most part) and B&tB were both able to do this. TLK was a money making machine, and, adjusted for inflation, is still more financially successful than Frozen. B&tB (spoilers coming) is the most critically acclaimed Disney film ever made, and it actually tried to scare their audience with the character who eventually became the hero and romantic love interest. I've witnessed children closing their eyes and shrinking in fear during the West Wing scene. I don't believe that there is a necessary tradeoff between pandering to kids, financial success, and well crafted cinema.  Edit: AC, SGPFC"
Frozen,3bhwzt,Xator_Nova,2,Tue Jun 30 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"Go ahead. We could probably help you and even change your mind.  EDIT: I think that at this point we can recognize three flaws from a critical standpoint.  1.- The animation glitch in Let it Go, when Elsa is untying her braid and the hair passes through the arm.  2.- The plot stops completely when Olaf appears and sings In Summer. The musical number itself is funny, but it does not add to the story.  3.- Near the end of the film, a ship appears out of nowhere when Elsa unfreezes everything, so that they dont fall into the water. There is no ship in the scene prior.  Otherwise, I think that most criticisms are subjective or have to do with personal tastes."
Frozen,3bhwzt,Cameback,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:41:48 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Interesting question. Just with my young niece over the weekend and I was shocked to hear her say she “didn't like Frozen”.   Her parents told me that it was just a “school thing” and it will all be forgotten soon.   It's whatever popular opinion is at the moment.   Her sister,  my other niece who is 4 years younger, still loves Frozen.     I wanted to ask my niece who all of a sudden disliked Frozen, because her friends disliked it, what she did with all those Frozen toys I bought her (I would've asked for them back, and donate it to kids who wanted Frozen merchandise, as long as they were in good condition).     The proliferation of Frozen merchandise and it's already massive success, most likely has caused a backlash.   It's strange to see aisles of Frozen merchandise without people there, when just last year that aisle would be packed, with no room to move.     Disney didn't know it would be such a huge success and now they've overproduced the merchandise, it seems too much to take in.   I still see people gobble up Frozen merchandise, (I'm still working on my Frozen Mystery Mini collection), but I can see why some people have had enough of this animated movie.  I mean Elsa (a fictional animated character) is now the cover girl in the cosmetics aisle (not that there's anything wrong with that).    Even the Frozen composers'  have said in interviews, that their eldest daughter is alredy “over Frozen”.    Frozen has made it's legacy, good or bad, but sometimes I wish Disney would have underplayed their success rather than overexposing it."
Frozen,3bhwzt,Chisstastic,2,Mon Jun 29 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Kids are notorious for having short attention spans, so that doesn't surprise me much. If anything, I've actually been surprised that the Frozen mania among children held on for as long as it did--I would have expected it to peter out six or eight months after the film's release. Yet my dad (a dentist) was telling me as recently as a few months ago about the streams of little girls who come through his office clutching their Elsa dolls.   I do agree that Disney overproduced Frozen merchandise, especially since a lot of it looks so cheap and rushed out. But at the same time, that's not even remotely a problem unique to Frozen (no matter what Frozen's critics claim). You see the same over-proliferation of cheap-looking merchandise for other popular franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, etc."
Frozen,3bhwzt,XNinja2017,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"All opinions are welcome comrade! Don't let that hold you down.  I am at work right now so I can't provide my full thoughts on the film. Well, I absolutely enjoyed it, but even I see some aspects that could have used some improvement. For one, I was always under the impression that the film was too short so the plot felt somewhat rushed. The music was fantastic both the ambient and dialogue-music (I don't know what it's called >_>). Contrary to what many believe, I personally think that no one song is redundant. Each one song had it's own special niche in advancing the plot, as well as conveying a message which complemented and supported the thematic of the film. Every character played their role greatly, but I feel that they can all still use a lot of further development. I think Frozen II will fullfill that which the first film lacked."

Frozen,3bhwzt,LastUniqueUserID,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:11:29 2015 UTC,"I am a huge HUGE Frozen/Disney fan. I have giant collection of stuff and I just keep adding to it lol. I've seen Frozen so many times I can recite it word for word just about. But I'll be the first to admit It's got a few flaws (lulz). I've just noticed some plot holes that I've found no answer to so far, so if you know, let me know! 1) why does Elsa have her powers? They say she's born with them, but from who? Does that mean in the sequel Anna might have powers?  2) how do they know the trolls? Does the king and them have some sort of agreement? Or do mythical creatures just exist?  3) Kristoph mentions that he's seen the trolls do there magic before on Anna when they were little. Why doesn't he explain that to her? That he's always known the queen has ice powers and why does them meeting for the first time at the Inn seem ""new""? He's seen her before and she looks just the same as when she was a child to her current age lol  4) they closed off the castle, but why couldn't Anna just go outside her self (into the city?)? She had no reason to be locked up the castle and she could have easily gone outside. It could be the time period and how she might not be the right age to go out on her own or maybe it's her royalty that prevents her, but why did she have to wait for her sisters coronation?? Every time I watch it, I catch more and more that just makes me question it. But I still love it so much and I don't think it's bad at all. So if anyone can help answer my questions, I would appreciate it!! :)"
Frozen,3bhwzt,CarterDug,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but no film is.  And in my opinion it's strength far outweigh it's weaknesses.  Of the top of my head here are two things that I might change:   Distribution of the songs - Almost all of the good songs are within the first 30 minutes.  I would have liked to see more songs in the 2nd half of the movie. Hans reveal - I don't really think it was necessary for Hans to become the ""villain"" at the end of the movie.  I think they could have arrived at a similar ending without a villain, per se.   That's about it.  Other than that, it's perfect IMO."
Frozen,3bhwzt,LastUniqueUserID,2,Tue Jun 30 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"I think to arrive at a satisfying ending, Hans needed to become the villain, or at least morally questionable.  After Anna's ""trust"" exercise, I was pretty sure she and Kristoff would end up together, but then where does that leave Hans?   There are three ways this triangle could have played out.   1) Anna chooses Kristoff over Hans, and everyone is sad because Hans was such a great guy.   2) Hans dies, and everyone is sad because Hans was such a great guy.   3) Hans becomes the villain, and everyone is happy when he is removed and Anna can be with Kristoff guilt free.   In order to create the most satisfying resolution, Hans had to become the villain so that we wouldn't feel bad about Anna choosing Kristoff over him.  And I also think the reveal was the shock that Anna needed to humble herself and think critically about her own shortcomings, so it was an important moment for her character development."
Frozen,3bhwzt,CarterDug,3,Tue Jun 30 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I always felt like he could have kissed her and then when it didn't thaw her heart he could have admitted that he liked her, but didn't love her.  Or he could have said that he hated her because she was really annoying, self absorbed and reckless! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  But I guess it would have been pretty difficult to have a good ending to Frozen where Hans is still a good guy.  I'm just not a fan of the idea that you have to have a clear villain in every movie."
Frozen,3bhwzt,LastUniqueUserID,2,Tue Jun 30 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"Or he could have said that he hated her because she was really annoying, self absorbed and reckless! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Haha!  paspartuu's Helsa fic kind of does this. Ch 1 Spoilers for A Particular Understanding: The first chapter basically retells the events of Frozen through Hans's perspective, and his views on Anna and her behavior are not favorable at all. As such, the reveal scene is personal for him. He had the choice to just let her die with her fairytale delusions, but Hans decided she didn't deserve it, she didn't deserve to die in blissful ignorance. He wanted her to know just how much of a fool she really was, and so he tore into her with that monologue with the intent of hurting her as much as he could. It was a glorious scene, but it's only glorious when seeing it from his perspective.  Edit: SGPFC"

Frozen,3bgwzi,limitbreaker77,2,Mon Jun 29 03:06:25 2015 UTC,Every time someone posts a Harry Potter/Frozen crossover it reminds me how much more powerful Elsa is than anyone in Harry Potter.
Frozen,3bgwzi,OtomeOtome,2,Mon Jun 29 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"She is? Her raw power might be big, but her lack of skill and knowledge makes her less fearsome than a third-grader.

Frozen,3bgw0g,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"Shit, that reminds of of The Royal Guard fom the fic A Royal Wedding - his/her hair turns white and eyes blue after Elsa brings them back from the dead. I suppose that would make them a wight or lich-like creature."
Frozen,3bgw0g,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:09:57 2015 UTC,"Elsa couldn't her sister body lie their motionless. She couldn't accept it. But something whispers to her hear 'bring her back', she looks around and finds no one. 'Raise your hand, and bring her back'. Elsa followed the voice ,as if it controlled her, and closed her eyes as her hands starts to glow over her sisters body. She saw visions of snow and ice, and saw A figure in the shadows. It shows itself, with her eyes glowing 'Hello Sister'. Elsa blacks out."
Frozen,3bgw0g,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:59:15 2015 UTC,"The implications of Elsa animating a corpse have always intrigued me - exactly how is she doing it? Is true life being brought back, or is she merely using magic to force the heart to beat again, and the limbs to move. Does she have control over it? Is the body truly alive, like her other creations, or is it merely a thrall or a wight?  And chiefly, the mind. Has she somehow brought back the soul, or is the body dominated by Elsa's memories of said person re-creating their personality? Essentially, is it a cloned personality re-created from her memories of the dead person, or the actual person themselves?  There are so many ways to go with a re-animation fic. A Royal Wedding did so in a light-hearted way, and never explained exactly what he/she was after being brought back( it's made clear that his/her heart is made of ice, and the wound in their chest cannot be healed, only being sealed up with ice. Elsa's magic is what forces the blood to pump, but The Royal Guard can still feel pain and become injured - and seemingly recover from injuries excluding his/her heart. Essentially, their life is tied to Elsa's. If her magic becomes unstable, so does their condition, and if she dies, he/she has about half an hour before the magic fades and they die as well.  The concept is really interesting."
Frozen,3bgw0g,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:01:32 2015 UTC,Well Elsa's magic seem to susceptible to emotion so maybe if the Person is dying but still somewhat alive she could insert magic into them. Replacing each body part with snow structures. The persons emotion would then empower the magical constructs.   One intriguing example is how Anna was brough back to life in frozen. It seems that flesh can be transformed from ice
Frozen,3bgw0g,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"I hope some of this is eventually explained in a book or the sequel. There's so much about her powers that we don't understand, chiefly creating/giving life. On replacing boy parts - Frozen Wight had a little girl with missing arms get a new pair of ice arms(though, she's a cryomancer like Elsa, and only appears for one scene...and is technically a ghost. So I suppose this is subjective?)  At any rate, ja, I'm really interested in the life-giving/healing aspects of Elsa's powers."
Frozen,3bgw0g,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:15:26 2015 UTC,I would like it to be in the official book of the sequel so that the details of her powers could be fleshed out.

Frozen,3bfow1,Schadenfreudenous,2,Mon Jun 29 03:20:54 2015 UTC,I'm a huge sucker for horror/violence AU's. It's all about the reactions of the normal characters to the crazy ones. Big reveals and twists are great.
Frozen,3bfow1,Demian_Dillers,2,Mon Jun 29 03:29:16 2015 UTC,AFAIK usually Anna ends up imagined as the psycho one...well she does sort of come off as one.
Frozen,3bfow1,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"It's easy to imagine the pair that way - one is outgoing, hyper, happy, and seems a little out of it. The other is sad and lonely, hiding away from the hyper one. It's not hard to imagine who the killer would be, especially when Anna's personality is frequently used as a yandere/yangire cover in pop culture.  Hell, even in my Assassin's Creed crack AU, Anna is the assassin hunter, while Elsa is the sit-back type of leader(I actually wrote out a bit of this a while back, and have plenty more)."

Frozen,3bf24d,BartyMae,3,Sun Jun 28 17:23:11 2015 UTC,Which is what lol?
Frozen,3bf24d,Schadenfreudenous,3,Sun Jun 28 17:31:26 2015 UTC,"On a more serious note...my least favorite character is...the troll lady. Bulda is her name, Google says: she represents everything I dislike about the trolls, and she's the most prominent non-Anna/Kristoff character in that entire sequence. Likely challenges include trying to get her to stay on task without getting distracted by irrelevant nonsense...avoiding forced marriages...trying to get her to shut her stupid singing piehole that carries her voice oh so dangerously far while we're trying to sneak into the castle...I'm also imagining that, as a heavy rock-like substance (...as well as by her general demeanor), that she has no concept of or any real ability for stealth...EXCEPT for camouflage, which, combined with her short stature, may come in handy. She could possibly make an excellent sentry, and even though I doubt she could move quietly with any speed, she could slowly move around corners and spot possible hostiles without attracting notice.  Additionally, as a heavy rock troll lady, I'm assuming she has pretty good strength...and probably great endurance, too, right? Likely also quite durable...and with that musical voice of hers combined with her natural camouflage (I'm assuming most residents of Arendelle, even monsterfied ones, would be able unable to immediately recognize a troll or their ""rock"" form), I think she could make an excellent diversion if there are any junctions that are too well guarded for me to sneak through...and she should HOPEFULLY be able to catch up with me in any such scenario, even if I'm not there to make sure she's actually being quiet enough not to be discovered...  We could probably make it if we were careful. If not, I throw her into the water surrounding the castle and leave her to be dragged down into the depths by Cthulhu while I hastily swim towards the castle and scale my way upwards. It's tough to say what happens after that."
Frozen,3bf24d,mathspook777,3,Sun Jun 28 17:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think the Trolls are the most helpful because they don't really seem to possess any fears that we know of.

Frozen,3bblpo,MINECRAFT_BIOLOGIST,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:57:23 2015 UTC,Eh? I'd like to think it's gotten better haha :)  I drew this a while ago: http://deadlyazn.deviantart.com/art/Bloody-Ruby-534514162  And sketched this: http://deadlyazn.deviantart.com/art/Twisted-Ruby-sketch-539933363  Also drew Blake's butt but someone reported my picture and it got removed from DA o.O even though I had it marked as NSFW : http://i.imgur.com/nTlw84B.png

Frozen,3baodx,ArendelleKnight,6,Sat Jun 27 11:36:11 2015 UTC,"There would be no Frozen xD.  Seriously though, this is pretty cute haha."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,4,Sat Jun 27 12:37:18 2015 UTC,Alternatively from other universe: a short that will pair with [some Disney movie].
Frozen,3baodx,ricANNArdo,3,Sat Jun 27 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"Like a crossover Tangled short film introducing the characters of Anna and Elsa as Rapunzel and Eugene travel to Arendelle to attend Queen Elsa's Coronation?  That could work, and it could still lead into what we will know as Frozen 2, just in that universe it would be the first Frozen movie."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,4,Sat Jun 27 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"Might as well put Frozen Fever in front since this photo edit is quite reminiscent of the start of it. It could still work to be honest, but the question is would it become as popular."
Frozen,3baodx,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"it could still lead into what we will know as Frozen 2, just in that universe it would be the first Frozen movie.   You mean it could lead to a Frozen movie, or the same Frozen 2 we'll get? :P. It would certainly be completely different, doubt it would get so much attention."
Frozen,3baodx,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"What I meant is it would lead to our universe's Frozen 2, but in that universe it would be the first feature length Frozen movie. :P  Depending on what Frozen 2's story is it could be similar, but yeah it would probably be different in some ways from the Frozen 2 we're actually going to get if Anna and Elsa weren't separated at the time of Elsa's coronation."
Frozen,3baodx,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I imagined that's what you meant. It would be pretty different though, for one, the entire supporting cast wouldn't be there xD."
Frozen,3baodx,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"That's true.  Unless Anna met him some other way early in the movie Kristoff wouldn't be there, so neither would Sven.  Maybe Elsa would have discovered her ability to bring snowmen to life at some point, so Olaf could still be there."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"Another Olaf though, since he would've been born differently (Then again it wouldn't matter much for his characterization by Disney). Also not Oaken or Marshmallow. And Anna wouldn't be in love. Their entire would would be different."
Frozen,3baodx,dragongt1994,2,Sun Jun 28 03:35:44 2015 UTC,Maybe if somebody time travelled making this all possible :D
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, you would need something more akin to dimensional travel. Time travel backwards is impossible under the current laws of physics. However, there are methods there as well to sort of ""cheat"" the universe and circumvent that barrier. If a ""configuration space"" (Meaning all the possible particle permutations that this reality can take. See String Theory and the Many Worlds Interpretation of the Cosmos) exists, then you probably could. Time isn't a uniform concept. It flows at different rates. Therefore, you could assume that different particle configurations, or dimensions, flow at different rates of time relative to ours."
Frozen,3baodx,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:13:08 2015 UTC,The Many worlds theory would allow flexible story telling :D. You could pretty much do anything without leaving plot holes to the story :D
Frozen,3baodx,ricANNArdo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"That depends if Disney would give an official statement concerning that matter, but I doubt they give a s*** about quantum mechanics in their films xD."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"If not explaining Elsa's powers was a great decision in stream lining the narrative, surely not explaining the complexities of time travel would work considering how confusing it could be. Just have trolls draw on a chalk board or something :))"

Frozen,3baodx,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Way too much focus on Anna here (though it's obviously due to using existing pics). The day is for Elsa, so if anything Anna'd get up early to dote on Elsa. Anna bugging Elsa is how it's always been, the birthday thing is the only exception (a huge 'thank you' and making up for a lifetime of separation).  I know it's a different script but I think it'd be much closer to this scene. Even outside the power-fear thing, she's always been the ""cool"" type, even when they were kids. Would love to see some casual interactions like that in the next movie.  Serious business, I know!"
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"Well, if they were never separated then they would've grown up pretty differently I think, would be interesting to know what kind of clothes would Elsa use, since she'd been herself but not the one we know. Anna would probably be way more responsible and whatnot.   However given what we know, Elsa would most likely turn into evil Elsa since those were the original plans when the story did have them together. Wonder what the rest of the chars as we know them, think of Evil Elsa, she'd probably eliminate the Duke and Hans herself, but Anna would still think that Hans was good so that would be the biggest breaking point for Anna to give up on her."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"Going by early drafts of the script we would get Evil Elsa, but I don't think that's what we'd get if the Elsa we know wasn't separated from Anna for 13 years, if her powers weren't kept secret from Anna all that time.  As for Hans I doubt he'd even be a major factor.  First of all I don't think Anna would have been in a hurry to get engaged to a guy she just met in the first place if she and Elsa weren't separated and the gates weren't closed all that time.  Elsa also wouldn't have set off the eternal winter, therefore Anna wouldn't have went after her, therefore Hans wouldn't have been left in charge, Anna's heart wouldn't have been frozen, and Hans wouldn't have had an excuse to sentence Elsa to death, nor would anyone have thought for a minute that he had the authority to do so."
Frozen,3baodx,XNinja2017,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""curse"" thing wouldn't be a factor. But either Everyone knows or just her family. If it's just Anna, Elsa would still feel very restricted and fearful others might find out, eventually an accident like the one that happened in Frozen wouldn't be out of the scope, and her fears would still damage her. Her dynamic with Anna might be pretty different though, in the end seems loving itself is not enough to control her powers, so there would still be problems, I think later kind-of-evil Elsa we see at times would be the result.  If everyone knew, she'd use her powers more but probably also have more problems like snowgies and more accidents, seems her powers got pretty wild on her development. In the end I can imagine people distrusting her and leading it all to evil Elsa like the songs.  Hans would probably not ask Anna for Marriage, but she might still trust him enough and they could still have a ""connection""."
Frozen,3baodx,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""curse"" thing wouldn't be a factor. But either Everyone knows or just her family. If it's just Anna, Elsa would still feel very restricted and fearful others might find out...   Sure, though I'd imagine the fear would be less without that memory of hurting Anna with her magic, or with the knowledge the accident was just that and that she is in control of her powers.  She didn't really lose control the first time she struck Anna, she just panicked and missed when she was trying to catch her.   ...eventually an accident like the one that happened in Frozen wouldn't be out of the scope, and her fears would still damage her...   I don't think anything like the Coronation incident would have happened if she learned to control her powers as they grew with her, if she didn't live in fear of herself for 13 years.  She would have learned to love and accept that part of herself (her magic) long ago, and she would have control.  I don't think it would have been a problem whether she chose to keep her powers secret from her people or not.   ...Her dynamic with Anna might be pretty different though, in the end seems loving itself is not enough to control her powers...   I don't know where you got that impression...   ...so there would still be problems, I think later kind-of-evil Elsa we see at times would be the result.   ...or that one. ;)   If everyone knew, she'd use her powers more but probably also have more problems like snowgies and more accidents, seems her powers got pretty wild on her development.   As I said before, I think had she not spent 13 years fearing her magic she would have stayed in control of it.  I don't think there would have been significant accidents like her temporary eternal winter.  I'm sure snowgies would still happen when she gets sick, there's no reason to think they wouldn't, but that's not eternal winter level disastrous at all.   In the end I can imagine people distrusting her and leading it all to evil Elsa like the songs.   Somehow I doubt that considering how accepting her people were of her magic after the eternal winter. ;)   Hans would probably not ask Anna for Marriage, but she might still trust him enough and they could still have a ""connection"".   Another thing to consider here is why Hans decided to pursue Anna in the first place, cause his original plan was to marry Elsa, at least that was his plan three years before the coronation.  He pursued Anna because he thought it would be easier, because she was desperate for love because Elsa had shut her out and she didn't know why.  If things were different she wouldn't have been so desperate for love, maybe she wouldn't have fallen for him at all.  Even if she did I think she would listen when Elsa told her something was off about him, and I think she would have figured that out, just maybe not as quickly if he didn't rush the proposal, cause I think that's a big part of why Elsa thought something was off about him."

I mean, she has Kristoff already, what chance would I stand?   Her description is really spot-on and cute though."
Frozen,3bbgmj,potato-table,2,Sun Jun 28 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"Your best friend should be Elsa!  Elsa is regal and elegant—she is the queen after all.

Frozen,3bbrt2,LastUniqueUserID,7,Sat Jun 27 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"I love her character. A lot more than her sister. Don't know about you guys, but Anna was always a much more fascinating and more relatable character for me. She's happy, joyful, and overall really pleasant to look at.  Anna FTW"
Frozen,3bbrt2,Portgas,2,Sun Jun 28 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm unusual in that I love both characters, although I personally find Elsa a little more interesting.  As far as being relatable, I can relate to different aspects of both Elsa and Anna.  And probably it's a little strange that I feel the need to defend both characters against verbal attacks."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,4,Sun Jun 28 03:31:09 2015 UTC,"I just find her more likable than her sister. She fails, she tries again. She seems to weather the storm and still sees the best in people. People see her as bratty or selfish but this same people fail to realize she has absolutely no knowledge of what was happening and was practically winging it because she needed to because her sister was being incompetent which was fairly consistent through out the movie.   Anna made more mistakes because she was doing something to fix it. Elsa was just useless through out the film. If you wanna see a movie centered around that, look at the first few episode (Edit:Season 4)  OUAT and how annoying that would be.   I don't get why Elsa is deemed the more interesting character or unique when she is essentially just an Xmen character with a less developed character. In fact most of her fans ignored pretty much ignore what was portrayed in the movie, and just imagines her as something else."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:37:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said regarding Anna, but disagree with everything regarding Elsa.  I wouldn't call Elsa useless.  I would consider her paralyzed by fear.  She basically doesn't know what to do.  She knows she has this ""problem"" - the inability to control her powers - and after 13 years of trying she just doesn't know what else to do."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,2,Sun Jun 28 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry on my comments on Elsa but I really think a sizable Chunk of Elsa's fanbase thinks female empowerment is some of form of magic power or doing nothing because of fear exempts someone from criticism. Ofcourse I still kind of like Elsa but some ofher fanbase annoys me because they seem to morph Elsa to something that she is not.   For all intents and purpose and what was Elsa's purpose, she was a good as a damsel in distress.   For the love of God, if frozen 2 'bends the knee' to the elsa fanbase iam willing to bet a lot of them would jump ship because that's not their version of Elsa. If this becomes an Elsa show, pray to god for another let it go song would rise and stay the fall."
Frozen,3bbrt2,kapperbeast,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:05:23 2015 UTC,"I try to stay away from the Anna vs. Elsa thing.  I like both of them, and feel that without the other they would each be diminished.  It's their interaction and contrasting personalities that help make Frozen what it is."
Frozen,3bbrt2,kapperbeast,2,Sun Jun 28 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yeh I could go with that :D, Yep I do like their contrasting personalities and how they parallel each other :D"
Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,3,Sun Jun 28 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"She's a nice character, but she seems a lot less interesting than her sister if I'm honest, I really liked the ""the spare"" song that got cut because of changes to the story though"
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jun 27 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"It's hard to compare to Elsa, but I still love Anna.  Without her, Elsa is most likely killed (worst case) or never seen again (best case).  Because of Anna, Elsa no longer views herself as a monster.  She is Elsa's entire support system.  That's why I love her."
Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,2,Sat Jun 27 18:48:51 2015 UTC,At what point are you imagining Anna not being a part of the story from?
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jun 27 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm primarily talking about after the death of their parents, but very early in the movie, before the accident, Anna also seemed to be the only one who truly appreciated Elsa's powers and gave her positive reinforcement.  She allowed Elsa to feel good about herself.  After the accident Elsa increasingly felt very negative about herself, as she had lost the only positive reinforcement that she had."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,2,Sat Jun 27 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, without Anna after the death of their parents, Elsa's coronation probably goes according to plan, she never sets off an eternal winter, and she lives out the rest of her days as a lonely reclusive monarch.  Without Anna before the accident, there is no accident, there's no visit to the trolls, and Elsa has no reason to view herself or her powers as negative.  One could argue that Elsa would have had a happier childhood as an only child, until she goes on a trip with her parents across the sea, but then maybe she saves them with her powers and her parents never die, which opens up the possibility of two of my favorite ships; Elduna and Hiduna (Hans x Iduna)."
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jun 28 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"We'll never really know what would have happened without Anna, but I think at some point Elsa would have still had issues due to the inability to control her powers.  It'd be great if they created actual alternate versions of Frozen at some point, just to fully explore some of these scenarios.  But more importantly, is Elduna what I think it is?"
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:27:17 2015 UTC,Elduna   This fandom never ceases to amaze me. I swear xD.
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"is Elduna what I think it is?   Maybe. It's Elsa x Iduna, though I should have called it Idelsa to make it easier to add Anna (Idelsanna)."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 01:01:11 2015 UTC,Cool!  You could always add Anna and make it Eldunanna.
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,2,Mon Jun 29 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I like Anna, not as much as Elsa, but I like her, she's even behind Kristoff TBH. I used to dislike her somewhat more before but I've understood more about the characters to this point to see her growth and why she's better than I thought. Understanding that to be honest I feel many Anna's derailment arguments are rather hypocritical (something I don't feel like discussing really) considering the rest of the characters' actions and behavior.  I dislike however a lot of the views on her as a character, specially those biased by Elsanna. I don't think she's that important for Elsa's entire psyche as part of the fandom believes she is  and I feel that actually diminishes both of them as characters. Elsa gets seen as a completely weak and useless character without Anna and I don't think that was ever the intention of the story. So I can say I dislike the ""Sister Anna"" (or Elsanna) effect, which by proxy affects Anna, although at this point I've managed to separate both pretty well."
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,2,Sat Jun 27 20:15:24 2015 UTC,I don't get why you take offense of Elsa being very dependent on Anna or being weak.
Frozen,3bbrt2,UnearthlyRamen,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:00:20 2015 UTC,I think the kind of codependency fixated defeats the whole purpose of the movie and diminishes them both as characters.
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,2,Sun Jun 28 08:40:16 2015 UTC,"People in general need other people to survive. Anna couldn't survive alone without kristoff or even Elsa. Elsa couldn't stand alone (for long). I thought the movie was all about finding each other again and how isolation and fear affects us.   Kristoff was probably the only normal guy in the movie because he had a fairly stable family. (Edit: Probably the duke also but he was a cunt)  Anna was weird and socially awkward because she had no interaction with other people but she still had her parents so she was still marginally normal.   Elsa had it worse because she couldn't normally interact with nobody.   Hans was a douche because he was ignored,abused by other people and basically lacked love from other people."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah , that's normal, relationships make characters more relatable because that's human, not like batman who is meant to be a symbol so he's one-man wonder, that's not what I mean. I mean when people literally think Elsa would crumble to tears and do nothing without Anna or Anna would lack direction on her life and go all stupid without Elsa, or when people can't have them as characters that stand on their own but just as ""sisters""."

Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,0,Sun Jun 28 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"Better.  Yes, officially. Unfortunately what constitutes the hair colour is widely disputed. Either way, Princess Anna should not be a redheaded in any way due to genetics & green is not flattering on her (seriously, stick her in magenta, put the blonde-haired blue-eyed Disney Princess in pink!)"
Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"Well, strawberry blonde is official so we don't really have to argue there. It's just the various lighting used throughout the film really that gives off that impression, but place her in a room with controlled lighting and it won't appear like a typical redhead."
Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,2,Sun Jun 28 10:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think that, while I find Elsa to be more relatable, Anna is a close second. I think both characters' journey throughout the movie led to my own personal development of my inner game.  First off, let me just get Elsa out of the way. While an annoying song at this point, at the heart of ""Let It Go"" is a theme of ""letting go of the fears controlling her"". In essence, it was the parents' fault for instilling external rules on her, that she must ""conceal, don't feel"" in order to be accepted, and happy. What she realizes is that she must focus on accepting who she is and practice self-compassion to advance her inner game, and that focusing on external validation is wrong.  But Anna. Holy crap. I actually think she's really misunderstood by a good chunk of people. IMO, she was plagued by the same mindset Elsa had, the mindset of ""I need to do x, y, and z"" to be happy. In her case, she believed that she needed external things like a romantic partner in order to be happy. Thus, her insecurity leads her to trounce on the first handsome guy she notices (Hans). In the First Time In Forever Reprise, she still has this mindset, and tries to tell Elsa that she needs to do x, y, and z to be happy and stop the eternal winter.   Anna's journey, then, is one of learning true compassion. Compassion in that she doesn't see everything else around her as separate from herself, and that she learns to walk in other people's shoes. Remember when she said ""you're no match for Elsa""? Well, when she sees Hans going after her, that was the big turnaround moment. She begins to ask herself the hard questions. How can Elsa have such awesome city-busting ice powers and yet be so vulnerable to a normal person with a sword? When she went after Hans' sword trying to save Elsa, it was her letting it go. She was focused on saving Elsa because that felt like the right thing to do in that moment. She wasn't concerned about unfreezing her heart, or stopping the eternal winter. She wasn't worried that she pushed Elsa away before, the past is in the past. And when Elsa sees this, she sees that Anna really isn't pushing her away anymore, and that Anna truly understands her."
Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,2,Sun Jun 28 08:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think that, while I find Elsa to be more relatable, Anna is a close second.   I feel the same way.   But Anna. Holy crap. I actually think she's really misunderstood by a good chunk of people.   I agree.  I think her primary flaw is that she was naive, but based on her circumstances that's completely understandable.  And insecurity is a trait that she and Elsa both shared.  I think some people ignore the fact that because Anna felt rejected by Elsa, it caused her to become very insecure and negatively affected her self image.   She was focused on saving Elsa because that felt like the right thing to do in that moment.   This.  I think Anna realized how tragic Elsa's childhood had been and couldn't bear the thought of her life ending that way."

Frozen,3bbrt2,CarterDug,3,Sun Jun 28 03:33:33 2015 UTC,That's probably the only negative thing I could say about Anna.
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,3,Sun Jun 28 05:10:56 2015 UTC,"Luckily I prepared an answer for this a long time ago as a more detailed response to this comment.  My dislike of Anna began within seconds of her introduction and just kept getting worse as the movie progressed. In her very first scene, Anna wakes up her sister because she wants to play. Does she care that Elsa was trying to sleep? Does she consider that Elsa might not want to play? It's funny that Jennifer Lee said ""I love the moment Anna throws herself on Elsa and says ""The sky's awake..."" because that's when I knew audiences were going to love Anna."" Source Comment, because that was the exact moment I knew I was going to hate her. Anna has a habit of not considering other people's desires before she acts, and this habit continues into adulthood.  During the snowballroom scene, she recklessly puts herself in danger, then puts the burden on someone else to save her, and she does this again to Kristoff later in the movie.  In DYWTBAS, she rarely, if at all, thinks about anything but herself. She only understands Elsa's isolation by how it effects her own happiness. She never asks Elsa if she's okay or if she's upset. There are only two lines in the song that might suggest that she cares about how Elsa feels: ""I wish you would tell me why"", which seems more like curiosity for her own sake; and ""I'm right out here for you"", but even then she manages to make it about herself with the next line ""just let me in"". This isn't just about her concern for Elsa, it's about what she (Anna) wants. Anna had given up on Elsa just before that point. It seems that part of the reason she tried again is because she thought Elsa's vulnerability in that moment presented a unique opportunity for her to get through the door.  When Hans tells her about his troubled relationship with his brothers, Anna uses this as an opportunity to turn the conversation back to herself (again, she only understands other people's experiences as they relate to her), then quickly forgets everything he said and invites his brothers (the ones who ignored him for years) to stay with them in the castle. I think paspartuu articulates this point really well.   at the presentation to Elsa, when Anna is gushing about the wedding, Hans's looks are really forced and stiff, especially after Anna suggests that ""hey, you told me that your brothers treated you like shit most of your childhood and that your past is painful and you want to leave it behind - but I already forgot it because I don't really care about you all that much, so let's bring all of your brothers here to live with us!!!""   She agrees to marry Hans without thinking about how it will effect those around her, then invites strangers to live in the castle without asking the Queen or Hans or anyone else if that's okay, refuses to speak to Elsa in private, then throws a tantrum and yells at the Queen in front of all her guests.  When she gets Kristoff to help her get to the North Mountain, she demands that they leave on her schedule, again, refusing to take into consideration the needs of others. It would be one thing if she explained to Kristoff that everyone in Arendelle is in danger until they stop the winter, but instead she throws a bag of carrots at his face and demands that they leave now.  During the wolf chase, she distracts Kristoff's attempt to save them by refusing to follow his request for her not to help. Kristoff says ""I got this"", and he looks pretty chill like he's done this before, but Anna doesn't listen. She's willing jeopardize their attempt to escape the wolves as long as she can feel like she helped, and her attitude costs Kristoff his sleigh. And this isn't the first or the last time her refusal to listen leads to bad consequences for her, it's actually a pattern. From the snowballroom scene, to the coronation party, to the wolf chase, to FtFTiF(R), to throwing snowballs at giant snow ogres, Anna doesn't listen to anyone, even when it's in her best interest to do so.  During FtFTiF(R), Anna can't bring herself to understand Elsa's perspective, responsibility, and fear (shocking, I know). She only sees the situation from her perspective. And when she fails to bring Elsa back, her first thought isn't about Elsa, but about how her failure effects her.  I think Anna is actually really selfish, stubborn, reckless, and egocentric throughout the whole movie. She rarely, if ever, takes into consideration the feelings of others until the very end when she sacrifices herself, arguably her first selfless act of the entire film. But by the time she starts becoming more selfless and humble, it's too late. My annoyance with her character is already at level 10.  And unlike other characters who have similar flaws, she doesn't have enough qualities that I admire enough to offset her negative traits. She's not smart, savvy, funny, wise, or awesome. She's brave (so is Hans), but her bravery is more similar to recklessness. She's brave because she doesn't know any better or is too stubborn to care. She also has no inner conflicts that add more layers to her character, nor does she have any insights regarding her situation or the world in general.  Her likability seems heavily dependent on her cuteness, but, for me, cute = annoying if it's a character's default setting (this is probably due to my irrational completely rational hatred of children). ""Cute"" should be the contrast, not the default. A character has to be more than cute before I find it cute. And because I'm not viewing Anna through rose colored cute-goggles, I see her actions for what they are: selfish, stubborn, reckless, and egocentric.  Are some of these criticisms unfair? Probably, but for the most part I think they describe the negative aspects of her character.  This article does a much better job of explaining why I dislike Anna."

Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,4,Sun Jun 28 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"I had a lengthy reply prepared to this, and then accidentally clicked on a link and lost everything that I had typed!!!  I'm just going to touch on a few key points.  In short, I think you're being unfairly harsh toward Anna, and viewing everything she says and does through an ""I hate Anna"" lens.   You say that she's only thinking about herself when she wants to play with Elsa, but even at the end of the first verse of DYWTBAS she sings ""it doesn't have to be a snowman"", clearly implying that she just wants to spend time with Elsa.  Is that what you're calling selfish? At the end of DYWTBAS when Anna sings ""I'm right out here for you"", you admit that she may be thinking about Elsa, but then you say that when she sings ""Just let me in"" she's once again making it all about her.  I think this is completely wrong.  All Anna's asking is for Elsa to open up to her so that she can try to help her.  In fact, she's basically begging Elsa to let her help.  This doesn't make it about Anna. When Hans (speaking of someone who really is completely self centered) talks about his brothers, Anna immediately turns the conversation to herself because ""she only understands other people's experiences as they relate to her"".  This was part of a normal conversation.  They were learning about each other's backgrounds.  And Anna was the one who started that part of the conversation when she said ""So you have how many brothers?"".  If she was only concerned about herself, she would have never even asked Hans about any of that.  She was really concerned for him, while he only saw her as a means to an end.   I don't have time to reply to each of the other points that you made, because I have to go out for a while, but I do have one final point.  I think you misread Anna's character and her motivation throughout the movie, and unfortunately that caused you to view everything she did in a negative light.  I don't think Anna changed from selfish to selfless during the movie.  I think she was always selfless, especially when it comes to Elsa.  Her primary motivation was reconnecting with her sister, and trying to help her - particularly after Elsa's powers were revealed.  That which you see as stubborn, I see as persistent.  IMO many times she was clearly uncomfortable, such as when she demanded that Kristoff and her leave for the North Mountain immediately, but again her motivation was the welfare of Elsa.  It's fair to say that she made some bad decisions, but to question her motivation is not.  During most of Frozen, we don't know the motivation of all of the characters, but by the end what really drives each and every one of them is clear.  Anna obviously loves Elsa and will do anything to help and protect her.  Hans, on the other hand, is completely self centered and will do anything to achieve his egotistical goals.  One final thought:  In hindsight Anna clearly made a lot of mistakes, but so did Elsa.  To hold Anna fully accountable for every bad decision that she made, while ignoring the mistakes that Elsa made is completely unfair.  When Elsa said ""May I talk to you, please. Alone."", sure Anna could have said ""Yes"" and everything would have been fine.  But just a few minutes earlier when Anna said ""I wish it could be like this all the time"", Elsa could have asked to talk to her alone and Anna would have agreed.  So they're both responsible for what ultimately happened.  I'm not sure if everyone who dislikes Anna also dislikes children, but I sometimes wonder if one's view of Anna's character may be closely related to that.  Someday I may put all my thought regarding Anna together in one semi-coherent post, rather than the incoherent manner to which I normally subscribe."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:00:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I was concerned that no one would respond.   I had a lengthy reply prepared to this, and then accidentally clicked on a link and lost everything that I had typed!!!   Amateur :3 (just kidding, but not really). Always type long responses in a word document.   clearly implying that she just wants to spend time with Elsa. Is that what you're calling selfish?   I would call it selfish if she's trying to force a relationship with someone who doesn't want or isn't receptive to having one. At the very least, I would call her response egocentric, because she's only thinking about the situation in terms of what she wants. Again, Anna never asks Elsa if she's okay or if she's upset, she never tries to reach Elsa on her terms or approach the situation from Elsa's needs. I think if I was unfair in this assessment, it's that I'm expecting too much from a 5-15 year old who appeared to grow up in social isolation, or that my assumption is too ambitious since the writers can only fit so much information into one song.   All Anna's asking is for Elsa to open up to her so that she can try to help her. In fact, she's basically begging Elsa to let her help. This doesn't make it about Anna.   I can see your point. I just think it's curious that she's once again forcefully asking to be let in, despite Elsa showing no signs of wanting to let her in for the past decade. How does she know that Elsa even wants to let her in or that it would be helpful to her? She doesn't. This could be seen as a continuation of Anna not being able to consider the feelings of others. And Anna wanting to be let in could also, at least in part, be due to Anna wanting to be with her sister during a difficult time rather than genuine concern for Elsa's well being, which is understandable, but doesn't show concern for Elsa.   And Anna was the one who started that part of the conversation when she said ""So you have how many brothers?"".   I accept this rebuttal regarding Anna turning the conversation back to herself.   That which you see as stubborn, I see as persistent.   Stubborn and persistent are basically the same thing with different connotations, like fragrance and stench. Since Anna's ""persistence"" more often than not led to unnecessarily horrible outcomes for herself and the people around her, I'm inclined to call it stubbornness.   I don't think Anna changed from selfish to selfless during the movie. I think she was always selfless, especially when it comes to Elsa. Her primary motivation was reconnecting with her sister, and trying to help her - particularly after Elsa's powers were revealed.   I can't think of any moment in the movie outside of her sacrifice that unambiguously suggests that Anna was genuinely concerned about Elsa. I see her trying to fix a problem that she blames herself for creating (I do like that Anna is quick hold herself accountable for her mistakes), and trying to force herself into a relationship with her sister.  Anna may not have been selfish at heart, but she had a self-centered perspective, she didn't mind prioritizing her own wants over others', and therefore ended up behaving in ways that inconvenienced everyone around her, including herself (see all the examples in my previous comment). As her character arc progressed, she gradually learned to see beyond her own perspective. Rather than paraphrase someone else's analysis, I'll just link it.   her motivation was the welfare of Elsa. It's fair to say that she made some bad decisions, but to question her motivation is not.   Why? It's not clear that her motivation is what you say it is.  You brought up Hans a couple of times, but I'm not sure how he's relevant to this discussion, unless you think that my dislike of Anna due to her selfishness is at odds with my like of Hans. There's a paragraph in my previous response that explains how Hans gets out of the trap.  You also asserted that Elsa made mistakes throughout the movie too, but even if true, I didn't say I disliked Anna because she made mistakes, I disliked her because I perceived her as selfish, stubborn, reckless, and egocentric, not to mention childish; five adjectives that would be difficult to label Elsa as.   I'm not sure if everyone who dislikes Anna also dislikes children, but I sometimes wonder if one's view of Anna's character may be closely related to that.    As far as I can tell, misopedia is still rare, but it appears to be on the rise.  Edit: Changed Quote"

On the other points, I think most of this really comes down to what you view as Anna's motivation, and we're clearly never going to agree on that.  If I viewed her as self centered, selfish, reckless, etc., I probably wouldn't like her either.  Regarding Hans, we also obviously disagree on his character as well.  While I don't necessarily feel that he originally planned on killing anyone, I also don't feel that he had any aversion to doing so.  My point is that Hans is far more self centered and egocentric than Anna is."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:59:17 2015 UTC,"When a response I'm typing gets around 500 characters, I copy and paste it to a word document to finish it.   I think most of this really comes down to what you view as Anna's motivation   Even if I were to assume her motivations were selfless, I'd still hate her because she's egocentric, stubborn, and reckless to the point that, despite her good intentions, she's still creating unnecessary burdens on others. A lot of people may think this behavior is cute or ""adorkable"", but I just think it's obnoxious, and if you don't think she's cute (possibly due to misopedia), then it's easy to see how obnoxious she is.  Regarding Hans, he's definitely selfish in that he's willing to hurt others for his own gain, but I'm more willing to look beyond his selfishness because he's so competent and calculating rather than obnoxious. But one thing Hans is not is egocentric. More than any character in the film, he demonstrated the ability to see things from other people's perspective, and this ability allowed him to manipulate everyone he encountered in the movie (Go Hans!). A person who can't see beyond his/her own perspective would not have been able to do what Hans did in Frozen.  The ice palace and summit siege scenes show an incredible contrast in Hans and Anna's ability to understand and interact with Elsa. While Anna had good intentions, her inability to understand what Elsa needed in that moment led her to push Elsa into a panic, eventually causing Elsa to lose control and strike Anna in the heart. Hans, with questionable intentions, was dealing with Elsa in rage mode, but he understood her to such a degree that he was able to say exactly what she needed to hear to snap her out of her rage and stop using her powers. That Hans is an amazing guy! Am I doing this right, TheHappyJammer?  Edit: SGPFC"

But one thing Hans is not is egocentric   He is egocentric, and far more than Anna.  Just because he can see things from the perspective of others, that doesn't mean he's not egocentric.  It's just a quality that makes him a good manipulator.  Anna is really more naive than egocentric.   Regarding Hans, he's definitely selfish in that he's willing to hurt others for his own gain, but I'm more willing to look beyond his selfishness because he's so competent and calculating rather than obnoxious.   But this is what makes Hans character completely detestable to me.  Hans is not just selfish.  He's narcissistic.  While Anna may make mistakes that would unintentionally hurt others due to her impulsive behavior or her inability to completely see their point of view, Hans can see their point of view but he does not care.  It's all about what Hans wants, and he's completely fine with hurting others - to the extreme of committing murder.   That Hans is an amazing guy!   IMO Hans is an amazingly terrible guy.  He is a complete jerk, and the fact that he's really, really good at it isn't enough for me to overlook it."

I don't think we completely disagree because you do acknowledge that, to some degree, Anna is reckless, stubborn, and self-absorbed (or whatever word you choose to describe it). But you see redeeming qualities in her where I don't, just like I see redeeming qualities in Hans where you don't.  Are there any bad guys/girls that you've liked?  Edit: AC"

Then again, it depends on how you define ""bad"".  I'm not completely averse to the concept of rehabilitating a villain, but I need to feel like deep down inside, they're a good person put in a bad situation.  What kept Elsa from becoming a villain was that she never intentionally hurt anyone.  They could have handled Hans' character in a similar way at the end of Frozen, which would have made it appear more as if he was just doing what he felt was necessary to protect Arendelle, but they didn't do that.  Based on what they did do with the character, they kind of ruined him for me."
Frozen,3bbrt2,Sylra,2,Sun Jun 28 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"This is unrelated to our discussion, but do you find it odd that your question asked only about Anna, yet a lot of responders found it important to compare her to Elsa?  Of the 10 top level responses that answered the question (not including my own), 6 or 7 of them (depending on how you categorize AnonnyMiss's comment) at some point compared her to Elsa."

I find Anna's character appealing, but she pales in comparison to Elsa, so I probably do the same thing without even thinking about it.  I think those who don't like Anna may do the same thing, since they'll see an even greater contrast between the two."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,3,Mon Jun 29 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Basically, you're criticizing Anna for being (1) impulsive and (2) immature. Now, impulsiveness is a personality trait that some people will like and others will dislike. It sounds like you dislike, and you're well within your rights to do that. But Anna's immaturity gets to the very heart of the story.  If Anna had stayed the same immature girl she began the movie as, she would never have even set out on her journey, let alone sacrificed herself.  Yes, Anna starts off self-centered. But when Elsa flees the coronation, Anna feels compelled to go after her. She thinks she has a responsibility to her sister. This is the start of a big change in her personality. She could have sent castle guards. She could have sent Hans. Instead she insists on going herself. She retains her feisty-pants impulsiveness, (and yes, it leads her to recklessness sometimes,) but that's the start of her maturation.  When she tries to convince Elsa to come back home, she doesn't make a petulant demand. She offers Elsa the emotional support she correctly thinks Elsa needs. It's Elsa who, at that point, is too childish to accept. Elsa doesn't want to admit that she can't do everything on her own. At the end of the movie, both Anna and Elsa have matured. Elsa, as we all know, has learned that she can rely on her family. Anna has proven that she's willing to sacrifice herself, which is a big step for a girl who got angry when her sister gave her good advice about boyfriends."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,2,Sun Jun 28 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have a problem with Anna being impulsive, but recklessness is a type of impulsiveness that is characterized by gross carelessness. Anna is reckless. I do agree that a large part of my dislike of Anna is her immaturity, but my tendency to hate immaturity can be overcome by many other virtues, of which Anna seems to have none.   She thinks she has a responsibility to her sister.   To me it seems she thinks she has a responsibility to correct her mistake, but that's not an important difference for the purpose of this discussion. I might have admired her decision to pursue Elsa on her own if it weren't so ill-conceived, and because it was so ill-conceived, she ended up unnecessarily burdening the people on her journey, the people back in Arendelle, and the person she was trying to bring back.  And I disagree that Elsa was being too childish to accept Anna's help, I think she was being realistic. Elsa has a much better understanding of her powers than Anna, she's all too aware of how dangerous and volatile they can be, and Anna has no plan to help her end the winter other than naive optimism. Given Elsa's understanding of her powers, there's no obvious benefit to trying to control her powers with Anna, but there is an obvious cost. I understand why Elsa wouldn't want to risk her sister's life or the safety of Arendelle on the slim chance that she'll learn to control her powers before killing someone rather than using a method that she knows to have worked for her in the past. It's not about Elsa not being able to admit that she can't do everything on her own, it's about her wanting to keep Anna safe, and she explicitly says this at least 3 times at the ice palace.  I understand that Anna had to be immature in the beginning in order to show growth. tfwyouloveher wrote a great post on Anna's character development that I've linked in another comment in this thread. But Anna doesn't seem to grow that much until Hans's reveal, and by then I had been so thoroughly annoyed by her character that I was taking pleasure in her suffering.  Edit: SGPFC"
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,2,Sun Jun 28 07:08:26 2015 UTC,"Ah ive read that article before, it made me furious of the Elsa fanbase. They pretty much ignores Elsa's stupid decisions and blank slatedness just because of let it go.   I like Frozen haters more than such people because it kind of shows how selfish or lazy they really are because of how they see themselves as Elsa. Its not even the fault of the character for the fanbase not even recognizing her flawed her character is and simply put her to some pedestal. Its an insult to Elsa as a character"
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,2,Sun Jun 28 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"it made me furious of the Elsa fanbase   Why would this make you furious, and why would it make you furious towards people who didn't even write it?   They pretty much ignores Elsa's stupid decisions    There's a difference between ignoring Elsa's stupid decisions and highlighting Anna's. Doing the latter doesn't imply doing the former. And the article isn't even criticizing Anna's stupid decisions, it's criticizing her personal attributes.   it kind of shows how selfish or lazy they really are because of how they see themselves as Elsa.   I don't see how the latter implies the former, but do you have any evidence that this is the case at all?   Its not even the fault of the character for the fanbase not even recognizing her flawed her character is and simply put her to some pedestal. Its an insult to Elsa as a character   People pedestalize in every fandom, but I don't think it's safe to assume that the ones who do are representative of the general fanbase unless you have evidence that that's the case. They might not be pedestalizing her at all. Maybe you just view her character differently than most others. I certainly view Anna differently than most people.  Edit: AC"
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"Actions define our personal attributes and Anna is pretty well defined. Well considering how underdevelop Elsa, She's a blank slate. So most of the interpretation of her is basically what they want to see themselves. They invent sh*t up as being a good queen, smart or brave or some shitty attribute with no evidence. If there was evidence it was obscure. Some even add attributes that are mostly contradicted by the movie.  Bunch a horsesh*t, What the fandom usually admits is the 'Elsa is afraid' crap excuse basically making Elsa loosing responsibility of what she's done. Frozen fever Elsa( the writers) understood this and she basically said sorry.  Anna took responsibility for every wrong she did. She payed for it. I don't why anybody holds it to her expecting her to be a Mary Sue character."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,0,Sun Jun 28 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"Do you believe Princess Anna would ever own up to her mistake of trusting Prince Hans. While she should be pissed at him for his fabrications & manipulations, she should blame herself to a considerable degree, too."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:47:07 2015 UTC,She already shown she had the capacity to own up to her mistake in the movie therefore its really not that hard to imagine she would accept her mistakes with hans
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,0,Mon Jun 29 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"Princess Anna claimed responsibility of mistakes that are disputably her fault (I personally do not blame any party for the events that unfolded in the film), but I wonder if she would admit her wrongs if an adventure wasn't attached. Seemed like she does not blame herself for her altercation with Prince Hans when most well-rounded individuals would step back from the action of the world to review their decisions. Princess Anna has no such inhibitions or thoughts."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:13:20 2015 UTC,"Well having her take responsibility even though its not entirely her fault actually shows maturity. The thing with Anna is she is not well rounded at all (I primarily blame the parents because for not taking care of both girls properly). She is has problems with how she deals with things. Too optimistic. She thinks the world is some kind of fairy tale.   And if you would review that scene and the previous scene before that when she was talking to Elsa, Elsa is not exactly faultless either. Anna was completely fine with everything. She was just piss off that Elsa wouldn't explain her for the so many questionable things happening in the castle with no real reason. I would advise Elsa to give at least Anna a white lie or something to at least not be a dick to Anna. Anna acted somewhat immaturely but not without reason."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,0,Mon Jun 29 05:59:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, despite what should have been the greatest adventure of her lifetime, Princess Anna is still unrealistically optimistic. She never seems to doubt herself. She doesn't think before she acts, but worse she doesn't evaluate after the results of her actions are received."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 29 06:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yeh my criticism of Anna, she is too optimistic. For example, she should have been more angry with Elsa or have more bad blood after kicking her out in her ice castle. Its difficult to determine if Anna evaluates what happened since the movie cut off the ending. Frozen fever shows her growth though if you could count that"

Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,3,Sun Jun 28 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"I'm quite passionate about my hate of the character Princess Anna. She's terrible in every aspect. I blame Jennifer Lee who claimed creative control of the character (she cites Princess Anna as her favourite character & inspired by her personally) & her voice actress Kristen Bell (Jennifer Lee typecasted with Bell in mind). The greatest shortcomings in the plot all stem from how Jennifer Lee wanted Princse Anna to be loved & sympathized with the audience without giving her any redeeming or controversial qualities.  My hate is greatly exacerbated by how Disney is trying to promote Princess Anna to Snow Queen Elsa's level of prominence. A Frozen store in Disneyland was renamed from Elsa & Anna's Boutique to Anna & Elsa's Boutique so the protagonist could get top billing. Typically, in families the oldest child us listed off first when rattling off names & continues in descending order. The description of the upcoming Frozen ride seems to empathize the film was really more about Princess Anna's romance with Kristoff. The most irritating addition to the franchise was the lyrics to the song in ""Frozen Fever"". Aside from every other line being ""We love Princess Anna"", including from some malnourished children of the village, this idea was repeated constantly:   *For everything you are to us, and all that you do!""   What the heck, guys? What all does she do? Has she jumped in front of swords for everyone? Does Princess Anna bring goodies to every house? Has she ever done anything resembling honest work? Or is she really just too special & needs to be told she's special to feel valued by her community?  Dear Disney, stop trying to make Princess Anna happen! She's not going to happen!"
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jun 28 05:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'm quite passionate about my hate of the character Princess Anna.   I was just thinking how great it would be if one day you would comment on one of these threads with something like ""I now realize that I've been wrong about Princess Anna.  She's really one of Disney's most amazing and lovable characters!"".  Okay, I know that's never gonna happen, but it's kind of fun to imagine it.   A Frozen store in Disneyland was renamed from Elsa & Anna's Boutique to Anna & Elsa's Boutique so the protagonist could get top billing.   I didn't know they did that, and I'm surprised that by now they haven't given up on trying to raise the level of prominence for Princess Anna.   The most irritating addition to the franchise was the lyrics to the song in ""Frozen Fever"".   Well, it was her birthday after all, so it would have been kind of mean if they sang ""you're a stupid dumb ass responsible for all of the problems in Arendelle"".  Plus, the ""malnourished children"" were probably coerced into singing with scraps of bread or something like that.   Dear Disney, stop trying to make Princess Anna happen! She's not going to happen!   This is so fetch.  But, anyway.  We're never going to agree on Princess Anna (or Hans for that matter).  It's kind of like an clumsy vs. adorkable, stubborn vs. persistent, annoying vs. cute thing."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,0,Sun Jun 28 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"If a character is going to be cute & adorkable, at least let there be a reason for the traits other than for the sake of it or relatability. Nearly everybody is awkward to a degree, but at least in a narrative the characteristic should have substance to it.  Was it necessary or inherent to Princess Anna's characterization to be clumsy or awkward? Did it serve any purpose to the narrative?"
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"I personally think it was to contrast Princess Anna with Queen Elsa.  While Queen Elsa was supposed to be the perfect one, Princess Anna was supposed to be the opposite (clumsy & awkward).  The lyrics from ""Just the Spare"" confirm this:   She’s the scholar, athlete, poet.  I’m the screw up, don’t I know it.   So I think they didn't give her those traits strictly for the purpose of making her relatable.  I think they did it to make Queen Elsa seem even more perfect than she already was."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:10:43 2015 UTC,"I did not get contrasting vibes. Enlightening observation regardless.  It seems that ""More than Just the Spare"" was for an earlier version of both Princess Anna & Snow Queen Elsa. The phrase ""magic touch"" implies Princess Anna was knowledgeable of Queen Elsa's magic powers.  Point is, I do not know if Princess Anna in the final cut ever thought she was a screw-up. My gut says no, or else she would show much kore restraint in her behaviour."
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"On the soundtrack before ""More than Just the Spare"" Kristen Anderson Lopez says that although it got cut, it did help them tap into Princess Anna's character.  They chose not to focus on the screw-up thing in the final cut, but I still incorporate that into Princess Anna's view of herself, so I always saw her over-the-top behavior as a defense mechanism to hide her insecurity from others.  I think that's why I don't get annoyed by that behavior.  I just see it as Princess Anna trying to hide herself from others, much the same as Queen Elsa hides herself."
Frozen,3bbrt2,AnonnyMiss,0,Mon Jun 29 06:55:12 2015 UTC,Princess Anna certainly is not masking herself from the judgment of others by running blindly out of the castle or throwing a tantrum in the middle of her sister's coronation ball.
Frozen,3bbrt2,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:58:12 2015 UTC,"Well it fits her situation a lot, her awkward is a sign that she is not really used to talking to people."
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,0,Sun Jun 28 07:08:55 2015 UTC,Neither had Queen Elsa yet she still conducts herself properly.
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jun 28 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I had a huge discussion with this guy a while back about this matter. I concluded that despite her oppressive stagnated development, she still displays extraordinary mental control when not faced with a scenario involving the two things that she has grown to fear. Her desire to protect and ensure the welfare of Anna, and the concealment of her powers. Insert those variables into the equation and she tends to struggle. However, this only applies to film Elsa. Post-Frozen Elsa likely isn't bound to these variables, and hell, the former might actually motivate her rather than hinder her.  Look at how she acted when faced with a circumstance where she doesn't face these variables (The summit siege is an excellent example). She certainly isn't mentally weak as evidenced when she was able to hold her ground on that scene."
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,0,Sun Jun 28 22:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well.....not Exactly.... The entire movie revolves around her not thinking straight. I don't know where you getting this fact from.   If your gonna infer it from the coronation party, it was probably memorize lines since she was suppose to be trained and all that."
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,0,Mon Jun 29 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"Queen Elsa never spoke to a wide audience, but the audience is privy to her conversations with Princess Anna & she was soft-spoken yet firm. No way she could have been fed lines on what to say about Princess Anna's engagement. We also saw her conversing with other dignitaries before Princess Anna greets her with Prince Hans.  Don't kid yourself- Princess Anna is not awkward because of her ""isolation"". Princess Anna had the opportunity to entertain herself with numerous hobbies like Princess Rapunzel, but the girl just is not imaginative."
Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,0,Mon Jun 29 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"Don't try to put Rapunzel here because that girl personality seem to not match her supposed predicament. I don't like to discuss here because that's far from the topic. In summary Rapunzel's personality constantly contradicts her situation and supposed 'abuse'. That's my criticism of Rapunzel. ( Still like her)  Girls like Anna exist pretty much in real life in highschool college etc. Some have different reasons such as couldn't really fit in. Some couldn't talk straight to a hot girl or guy. I don't know why it is hard to believe that a person would act like that especially a person who seems to not use to it. Some may become accustom to it, some may have a harder time with it."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,0,Mon Jun 29 05:54:09 2015 UTC,Most people are anxious when speaking to those they are romantically interested in. But there is nothing in Princess Anna's mind that warns her of crossing into adverse territory.

Frozen,3bbrt2,XNinja2017,0,Sun Jun 28 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"Queen Elsa has not been seen doing much in Frozen, but she is queen, so it can be safely presumed she governs.  We also know Queen Elsa has made immeasurable sacrifices for the safety of everybody around her & will plan celebrations for loved ones down to atmospheric detail."
Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"The greatest shortcomings in the plot all stem from how Jennifer Lee wanted Princse Anna to be loved & sympathized with the audience without giving her any redeeming or controversial qualities.   Hence my comparison. Anna is like a line, Elsa is like a manifold. Elsa's life story can be interpreted in a myriad of ways that just about anyone can connect and relate with her. Anna explicitly lacks this attribute, yet Disney keep trying to promote her as the star. Let it go Disney, her time is up. Now, I am not saying to disregard her entirely but Anna isn't the center-stage like many believe her to be.   What the heck, guys? What all does she do? Has she jumped in front of swords for everyone? Does Princess Anna bring goodies to every house? Has she ever done anything resembling honest work? Or is she really just too special & needs to be told she's special to feel valued by her community?   Read /u/CarterDug 's comment because he addresses this matter there. Yeah, she didn't really appear to have experienced any development whatsoever until the very end when all of a sudden lolplot demanded that she suddenly change her outlook on life.   Dear Disney, stop trying to make Princess Anna happen! She's not going to happen!   Agreed. It was quite evident from the film's premiere who a majority of the audience was able to relate with. I don't understand why Anna is continually promoted as the selling piece for Frozen. Elsa is far more deserving of that title.  Edit: Stupid phone and it's AC."

Frozen,3bbrt2,dragongt1994,0,Sun Jun 28 08:47:00 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they do that?   Because Snow Queen Elsa merchandise outsells Princess Anna two to one.

Why try to promote a character that is riding on the crystal cape of another?   And yet she happened, like it or not she's got a big fanbase on her own right now, a fanbase that doesn't depend on people that like Elsa.   Princess Anna may have been the lead, but she's not the star. She doesn't really have much clout either- her popularity, much like Pixar Princess Merida, is waning with time. To be blunt, the character is shallow & so are her fans. I think most choose Princess Anna over Snow Queen Elsa out of subconscious pity for the underdog & feeling that she is sexually attainable/in the luster's league."

It is economically backwards to promote the less-popular sister over the considerable Queen of the Disney Princess franchise. Why try to promote a character that is riding on the crystal cape of another?   Because the franchise works over both characters. And they need to promote Anna to continue with it because ""sisterhood"" is one of the pillars of Frozen. Not promoting Anna would be like Warner Bros stopped promoting Batman when the Joker got more popular or if the MCU stopped promoting the captain just because more people prefer Iron Man. Elsa doesn't have any direct competition, so there's no need to actually put so much more effort on her. Putting both of them in equal grounds help them serve the allusion that they are both just as important for Disney, they aren't leaving anyone behind so in the end people will get Anna merchandise too only for that fact.   Princess Anna may have been the lead, but she's not the star. She doesn't really have much clout either- her popularity, much like Pixar Princess Merida, is waning with time.

On the contrary I see her popularity is rising. She and her fans are shallow? that seems like a pretty exaggerated generalization.

Frozen,3b8d2d,Theroonco,3,Sat Jun 27 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"So... you're choosing to misinterpret the PMs as ""bad people who attack everyone"" rather than admitting that it's because you showed something your friend ""probably didn't want... shared publicly""?  I'm not going to send you a ""nasty"" PM, and I won't downvote any of your comments. I'm glad your friend appreciated what you did. But surely you can be mature enough to recognize your error? At the very least, every negative reaction you've received could have been avoided if you had left the last half of your post title.  This subreddit is great. The people are very caring, even to the point where they will correct someone when they deliberately do something against their friend's wishes, as you claimed to have done. You can recognize your fault, or play the victim."

Frozen,3b756i,TheHappyJammer,7,Fri Jun 26 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"despite it being the middle of July, they are still in NORWAY, and it gets bloody cold there during the winter. Even in the time that Frozen take place, buildings would be designed and built to withstand that cold; even during the summer, the people that make it their home still have their winter gear.  Now, would the country have been in trouble if Elsa's winter lasted longer than it did? Yes, cause it was the middle of summer, they wouldn't have too much in the way of food stores on hand during the middle of the growing season. However, the winter only lasted like a week at most, and that wouldn't be anywhere near long enough to actually pose any real threat to the people.   So, did anyone die during Elsa's winter? No, i highly highly doubt anyone did, or if anyone did die, it wasn't from the winter itself."
Frozen,3b756i,Maleko087,3,Fri Jun 26 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"The storm lasted two days max. I think the reason people choose to believe that Arendelle may have suffered some casualties is because of how intense the storm got near the end. The inside of the castle was freaking sprouting ice spikes The Day After Tomorrow style xD, but yeah, it didn't really last very long for anything to happen."
Frozen,3b756i,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 26 18:50:38 2015 UTC,Well to do this I have rummaged through some old reddit posts about this topic and got the idea that the eternal winter lasted about three days to a week depending on how you watch the movie. So the circumstances off not only the severity of the weather but also the effects like ships could not enter or leave and the Arendellians were simply stuck there. Resources were bound to run out eventually. Also Arendelle's location is still kinda shady. If it is located in Norway... Where? And even then Elsa's winter would probably go over any normal winter that the residents face with Temperatures at the time of Anna's near death at least 0 degrees Celsius or way less since the winter maybe an interpretation of Northern Norway's climate which can get to that low of a temperature.
Frozen,3b756i,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 26 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"Greetings!   Well to do this I have rummaged through some old reddit posts about this topic and got the idea that the eternal winter lasted about three days to a week depending on how you watch the movie.   It's impossible for this event to have lasted a week. In fact, you can draw an accurate measurement regarding the amount of time elapsed by simply looking at the film. We know that Love Is An Open Door took place approximately at 22:30, therefore it's likely that Elsa departed the castle sometime between that time and midnight. I won't follow RL time in the region here because then you get into some messy territory that I don't want to deal with. Let's say the winter began at midnight, Elsa would have arrived at the North Mountain at sunrise which is around 7:00. Okay, in the following scene we see Anna on her horse at noon, and subsequently arriving at Oaken's at night. That's one day now. We see day-time come again once Anna and Kristoff are overlooking Arendelle, and continuing until the point when they meet the Trolls for Fixer Upper. That's two days now. The rest of the events in the film seem to take place up until a bit after sunrise as seen by the position of the sun when Sven convinces Kristoff to return to Arendelle. At most, it's 2 1/2 days dude.   So the circumstances off not only the severity of the weather but also the effects like ships could not enter or leave and the Arendellians were simply stuck there. Resources were bound to run out eventually.    Indeed, logistics would be impacted severely, but as stated here, people in the region are accustomed to such inclement weather. It wouldn't be very difficult for them to adapt to the sudden change in climate.   Also Arendelle's location is still kinda shady. If it is located in Norway... Where?    IIRC general consensus is RL Arendal.   And even then Elsa's winter would probably go over any normal winter that the residents face with Temperatures at the time of Anna's near death at least 0 degrees Celsius or way less since the winter maybe an interpretation of Northern Norway's climate which can get to that low of a temperature.   No, it won't. Zero degrees C won't have ice spikes sprouting up with ice forming within the crevasses of the stone like a Von Neumann swarm. Temperatures plunged to such retarded extremes near the end that I am suprised people were still walking around unimpeded by the storm.  Edit: Stupid phone and it's AC."
Frozen,3b756i,dragongt1994,5,Fri Jun 26 20:08:13 2015 UTC,You don't argue or protest against a being with almost God Like Abilities :))
Frozen,3b756i,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 26 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Despite the severity of the storm, I was always under the impression that there were no casualties or injuries whatsoever. No one seemed concerned at the end of the film."
Frozen,3b756i,ArendelleKnight,6,Fri Jun 26 15:40:41 2015 UTC,More importantly Elsa didn't seem very concerned at the end of the film.  If even one person had died because of her winter she would have been an emotional wreck.
Frozen,3b756i,XNinja2017,5,Fri Jun 26 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"That's true, but we didn't really see much of the aftermath of the storm. Nevertheless, yeah, Elsa was totally fine at the end, as well as the rest of the population of Arendelle, therefore it's safe to say that nothing really happened."
Frozen,3b756i,Demian_Dillers,5,Fri Jun 26 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully lots of people died, those  ungrateful peasants need to fear their Snow Queen!. Also Hans just gave away the kingdom's goods... dick."

Frozen,3b756i,NinaWindia,3,Sat Jun 27 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Like other people have said, since Arendelle is a pseudo-Scandinavian country, I doubt anyone froze to death.   However, I doubt the snow did any favours to Arendelle's agriculture. I imagine the summer harvest wasn't great that year."
Frozen,3b756i,RunAwayWoods,2,Sat Jun 27 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"This is great! Although I'm not sure what the noise you kept using was (the one that sounded a bit like a baby)...  Anyway, I think it is highly possible that at least one person died during the Eternal Winter. They way I've always seen it, the winter lasted more then a few days. I'd like the think that it lasted about a week, but the movie just didn't show the things such as uneventful nights where Anna was traveling with Kristoff.  I'd also like the believe that the scene where some of Arendelle's citizens are standing around and can be heard saying, ""snow?"" didn't happen immediately after Elsa fled, so lets just say about a day. The citizens would still be out and about looking at how the city had changed and wouldn't have received winter clothing from the palace yet. Why aren't they wearing any winter clothing you ask? The answer is because I think that it is a minor detail compared to Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Hans + co reaching the North Mountain and scaling it within 24 hours, in Elsa's winter.   Also, towards the end of the movie, there are giant spears of ice forming within the castles walls. I can only imagine what would've happened to people while in their, much smaller, homes."

Frozen,3b5e10,BartyMae,7,Fri Jun 26 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"I have not yet seen Frozen Fever, so I cannot really properly evaluate what I think of ""drunk"" Elsa...but I have to say, for personal reasons, I'm not too entirely comfortable with even just the idea. Again, personal reasons (that wouldn't be appropriate to expound upon here) and just the idea of it - I'm sure my opinion could change with proper context (i.e. seeing Frozen Fever). I can't really answer your questions, so I think I'll just leave my two cents at that, haha."
Frozen,3b5e10,XNinja2017,5,Fri Jun 26 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"Minor Spoiler Warning  Many say that she overdosed on Oaken's medicine, but she clearly didn't. You can infer from the short that she clearly suffered a reaction to the flowers that she was carrying around all day on her dress. There was also a short animation (sadly, I don't remember where it is, but it was on Tumblr) that had her displaying an allergic reaction to a bouquet of flowers that Olaf brought her. Also, she was incredibly reluctant on the short to take Oaken's medication in the first place. There is no substantial evidence to prove that she overdosed on any antibiotic in any way."
Frozen,3b5e10,BartyMae,3,Fri Jun 26 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"So...clarification: there was no actual alcohol at any point? Unless alcohol IS the antibiotic, so to speak...but that's different than, you know, drinking for fun or whatever."
Frozen,3b5e10,XNinja2017,3,Fri Jun 26 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, don't worry! IIRC, the contents of the RL equivalent of said antibiotic contained a lot of nasty ingredients though. She never drinks it though. Some other guys here know the RL item though, because I don't remember it anymore. You can try asking some of the other folks here about that."
Frozen,3b5e10,BartyMae,3,Fri Jun 26 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not too concerned about it: I was just curious, since from everything I've heard about her being ""drunk"" in Frozen Fever, it's been painted a bit differently than the way you're telling it, which is curious to me. I guess people just thought it was amusing(/cute?) seeing her that way, which is probably a good thing, haha."
Frozen,3b5e10,dragongt1994,2,Fri Jun 26 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"It was definitely funny, and although the story is painted that she was acting like that due her fever affecting her, they left it open to interpretation. In any case we'll know more of it once the shorts Blue Ray is launched, and it will be available online too, so you'll be able to watch it!"
Frozen,3b5e10,LastUniqueUserID,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"It was not allergies, it was her fever that made her that way. In any case we'll probably know more on the feature blue ray for the shorts they are launching the following months."
Frozen,3b5e10,Portgas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:58:36 2015 UTC,Elsa in my opinion is essentially 'drunk' in that short. They didn't really have to say it straight because of the kiddies.
Frozen,3b5e10,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 26 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking about this the other day.  It has potential for a great story, but I'd be really surprised if Disney went this route, for obvious reasons.   What kind of disasters could Drunk Elsa create?   Could go in a lot of different directions here.  Either something similar to the snowgies - kind of a nuisance, but not overly destructive.  The other possibility is that she does some serious damage to Arendelle, or even (gasp) Anna.   What kind of funny situations could arise with her drunkenness?   Wakes up in Anna's bed and assumes the worst (""I did what with my sister?) even though nothing actually happened.   Should Elsa really stop drinking?   Yes, even though drunk Elsa is pretty hot.  Come to think of it, sober Elsa is pretty hot too.   What kind of Drinks would Drunk Elsa chose?   She'd probably start out drinking something like wine, but would eventually take whatever she could get.   What kind of personal problems (I mean aside from her powers) could occur while she is drunk?   The whole think would put a major strain on her relationship with Anna, unless of course Anna also had a drinking problem!   If Elsa was really a drunk, what kind of reasons would you like her to have for becoming one?   None, except for reasons that are completely inappropriate.  So none.   Would Elsa drink with the rest of the crew?   With them and the she'd continue drinking without them."
Frozen,3b5e10,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 26 03:41:11 2015 UTC,"Could go in a lot of different directions here. Either something similar to the snowgies - kind of a nuisance, but not overly destructive.

Frozen,3b5e10,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 26 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"It'd be really amusing to watch, but ultimately would destroy my opinion of Elsa since I have an irrational hate towards alcoholics."

Frozen,3b5e10,montas,2,Fri Jun 26 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"She didn't get drunk dude. It was an allergic reaction due to overexposure to the pollen from the flowers that she incorporated into her dress at the start. Oh well, drunk is drunk so yeah.   What kind of disasters could Drunk Elsa create?   Everything dies. No joke. The girl is a f***ing walking nuke. Arendelle dies in a multi-megaton explosion. If this doesn't happen, then Arendelle drowns under an exponentially increasing number of Snowgies to the point where she surpasses the matter density threshold and they collapse into a black hole and the planet is crushed into a singularity. Congratulations OP.   What kind of funny situations could arise with her drunkenness?   See point one above.   Should Elsa really stop drinking?   Yes, she should. A walking weapon of mass destruction should never drink, but if she wants to, it's her choice. She is Queen, so she decides.   What kind of Drinks would Drunk Elsa chose?   Wine, because that's what classy people drink.   What kind of personal problems (I mean aside from her powers) could occur while she is drunk?   Mandatory Elsanna Mention  Okay, now that that's out of the way:  Well, Elsa isn't necessarily the most stable individual mentally even in her normal state. She would certainly experience a lot of mood swings which could prove dangerous to anyone nearby. I would imagine Elsa being highly aggresive when drunk.   If Elsa was really a drunk, what kind of reasons would you like her to have for becoming one?   I never want to see her drunk. For comedy reasons like Frozen Fever? Of course! But I never want to see her drunk from overdose ,or due to some other circumstance. I can never see Elsa as a character getting drunk.   Would Elsa drink with the rest of the crew?   To tell the truth, I can see Anna trying to persuade her to drink. I think she would take maybe a glass or two just for recreational reasons, but again, I can never see her drinking too much."
Frozen,3b5e10,goodygod,5,Fri Jun 26 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"Everything dies. No joke. The girl is a f***ing walking nuke   No kidding, like 115 times as powerful as the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb... some serious stuff!"
Frozen,3b5e10,UnearthlyRamen,5,Fri Jun 26 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"I have brought this up numerous times on this sub, but keep in mind that feat was demonstrated with a simple little gesture. You can extrapolate this feat to some rediculous calculations some placing her even at the teraton range. That's Wank!Elsa territory though, and normal Elsa is probably equivalent to at least an Ivy Mike or Castle Bravo sized nuke at full power."

Elsa is not that classy though, classy people don't clean their mucus with their arms in the middle of the city!   I would imagine Elsa being highly aggresive when drunk.

Frozen,3b2eo4,XNinja2017,6,Thu Jun 25 16:49:44 2015 UTC,"you are looking at the guys who have the capability to buy the entire entertainment industry.   That's precisely why. She's betting that Disney wouldn't want the blow to its reputation if the court settled in favor of her, and when the judge decided not to throw out the case, that became a distinct possibility. They were able to come to a settlement, which in this case probably means Disney paid her a lot of money to shut up. And because they're such a large company, they can do this; they care more about their reputation than whatever sum of money she was asking for (which was probably less than she could've been awarded had she won the case)."

Frozen,3b1266,CarterDug,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"Depends, this may be the turning point for Anna or maybe a chance of new growth. If I would her, I would try to go away for a while, try to think things through. She probably won't be as close to her sister any more though considering her sister hid it from her.   If these were the topic of a movie, it would probably need to spend alot of time with Anna and Elsa together maybe due to some circumstances. It would pretty interesting to see how both would with deal with it. In my opinion this has a high chance of happening considering Elsa's experiences as well as Kristoff ice fetish  Its a pretty heavy thing to deal it and I don't know exactly how would Disney handle it :)))"
Frozen,3b1266,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they could really grow as people/characters with this and they could explore a number of developments. In the end conducing it for Anna to accept it or leaving that thread for a 3rd film.  You're right it's pretty heavy, it could have a happy ending, if they show that Anna and Kristoff weren't working before and how he got close to Elsa, as you said their things in common might just naturally push them together. In the end the three of them would get to know themselves more, and we would explore a lot of facets."

Frozen,3ax07p,ElsaTheQueen,7,Thu Jun 25 09:38:02 2015 UTC,"My favorite character is either Elsa, Anna, or the Queen. I'm not sure who exactly, because I like all of them pretty equally for very different reasons. I don't think I could fight any of them, because...yeah, no, unless they've gone evil or something...and especially not Elsa, because I think outside of stealth and luck, there's no chance of defeating her even if I wanted to. :P"
Frozen,3ax07p,BartyMae,3,Wed Jun 24 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are evil xD. Like I said, you don't have to defeat them, just survive :p. For Elsa, yeah, she is way too powerful. I am sure someone here will come up with some elaborate plan to survive though."
Frozen,3ax07p,Ravager_Zero,6,Wed Jun 24 04:57:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be against Anna.  I'd find some armour, then challenge her to a knightly duel. And afterwards tea and cupcakes chocolate.  What?   Nobody said it had to be a fight to the death. :P"

Not as screwed as I would have been 4 months ago.   Would you fight them, or try to calm them down by other means?   Do I have to fight? It's a big castle. I could hide, or barricade myself in a room for a few hours.   If you think you can win, what do you do with your free day in Arendelle?   Depends on if the staff is there and if they'll serve me. If so, then eat. If not, then explore, play in the snow if there's snow, ask the people there if they know about Disney and Frozen, and maybe ask them what their perspective is on everything."

Even if it didn't work it'd still be fun to keep Anna as my hostage for a while.  EDIT:  My favorite's Elsa, but Anna's a very close second."

Frozen,3ax07p,CarterDug,2,Wed Jun 24 08:53:29 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling Hans loves having his ego stroked, so flattering him might work. I'd imagine it playing out like that episode of The Simpsons where Bart flatters his captor and convinces him to sing the entire score of the HMS Pinafore, which successfully delays his execution until help arrives. But I doubt Hans knows that musical, or any musicals. Maybe you could get him to open up about how hard it was to have 12 older brothers. That conversation could take up a few hours, and it would give some insight into Hans's childhood and motivations.  Edit: SGPFC"

Frozen,3ax07p,NerdyNinjaAssassin,2,Wed Jun 24 05:40:32 2015 UTC,"So I'd be very screwed because Elsa but I think maybe I could bond with her over our mutual mental illnesses. Maybe mimic Anna a little and express a lot of awe and joy upon seeing her magic, bend her heart a bit. Not that I wouldn't be awed anyways.   I'd spend my free day, ideally, playing in some magic snow with Anna and Elsa but I guess if she wanted to kill me the night before, that wouldn't happen so I'd climb the mountain and go explore the ice castle if it's still there."
Frozen,3ax07p,Sylra,2,Wed Jun 24 08:31:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I think I'll probably just ... RUN FOR MY LIFE !"
Frozen,3ax07p,HeimrArnadalr,2,Wed Jun 24 08:42:02 2015 UTC,"Well, this is easy. The castle is a non-Euclidean maze and Elsa spent most of her time in her bedroom, so she'll be unfamiliar with the nooks and crannies I'd be able to hide in."
Frozen,3ax07p,XzodiaYinZero,2,Wed Jun 24 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"Elsa has a huge love of chocolate, so since I look like I'm made out of it, she wouldn't be so eager to attack me.

Frozen,3ax07p,n00dles__,2,Thu Jun 25 02:00:31 2015 UTC,I'm going to have a harder time against Anna unless I get the jump on her. Against Elsa I'd probably try to get her to seduce me instead.
Frozen,3ax07p,OtomeOtome,2,Wed Jun 24 19:19:32 2015 UTC,I'd be against Anna. I'm pretty sure she's stronger than me but I might be able to hide and wait it out. She doesn't seem great at finding people.
Frozen,3awi2l,Demian_Dillers,4,Wed Jun 24 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to develop Elsa is of course focusing on both elements, because its as you said, they are both essential components to Elsa's character development. I honestly think Elsa has the potential to become one of the strongest female characters in fiction. As not only can she display her political prowess through her position as Queen of Arendelle, showing her subjects her power to rule, ether through benevolence of malevolence. Also she should also continue developing her powers so that it could improve her ruling power. As seen in most fictional universes, the leader of an organization, while you don't see them in the frontline very often, are usually the strongest person in their own organization, and for good reason, as its their uncanny leadership and powerful abilities that earned them that high position in their own organization. So I definitely think that in the next movie they should focus on Elsa's development both as a magician and a Queen/Ruler"
Frozen,3awi2l,cyberdragon1,2,Wed Jun 24 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with what you said. I'm that more people seems to really see both traits are intrinsic to her as a character and not just easily replaceable developments . Hopefully we'll see her improve upon both traits indeed, she has an amazing range of possibilities with that, her potential for a second movie is limitless!"
Frozen,3awi2l,HeimrArnadalr,4,Wed Jun 24 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"-Should Elsa use her powers to improve her ruling?   Absolutely. Her powers are a gift from God, and thus she has a divine mandate to use them to improve not only her citizens' lives, but also the lives of everyone in the world. I suggest she start with the Southern Isles and sweep across Europe from there."
Frozen,3awi2l,XNinja2017,3,Wed Jun 24 03:42:04 2015 UTC,"That would be absolutely effortless for her. Keep in mind that what she demonstrated in the film was with nothing but a flick of her wrist. Who knows? At full power, the girl can probably dish out gigatons worth of power. Elsa could subjugate 19th century Earth with little to no retaliation. Hell, she could probably stalemate modern Earth."
Frozen,3awi2l,Ravager_Zero,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say with the exception Russia—they know how to fight General Winter very well.  Also, I think there at a minimum certain geographic limitations to her powers. We know Arendelle as a whole was blanketed by the winter, at the very least from the mouth of the fjord to beyond the north mountain, but we don't know the extent beyond that. I personally think it's no greater than a 100 mile radius, and maybe not even more than 50 (granted that we don't know the distance between the fjord and the north mountain though, but that can't be more than about 20 miles—a person can walk on average 3 miles/hour, and Elsa might have been walking most of the night).  Also, modern military forces could just plaster the epicenter of any such system with artillery and air-dropped munitions or gunship strikes. Or even shore bombardment in some cases if she was within ~20 miles of the coast.  I think that's getting rather off-topic though."
Frozen,3awi2l,Drzhivago138,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, this is the best course of action the Snow Queen could take."
Frozen,3awi2l,XNinja2017,5,Wed Jun 24 13:15:01 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite fanfics/fan scenarios involve the political intrigue and implications that come with a sovereign possessing supernatural powers. I, for one, would like to see Elsa balance her continued control of her powers with her duties to Arendelle. As for making her powers a main theme, I'd say no, but mostly because we've already seen that. I don't think Anna would be all that great as a monarch, at least not without a large retinue of advisors. Her first duty as regent was to run off and appoint a foreign prince in her place (who was better anyway, IMO, but now I'm getting too far off topic, so I'll just stop there)."
Frozen,3awi2l,mavisbangs,3,Wed Jun 24 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Great idea here. Face it, for the most interesting and captivating character in the franchise, Elsa didn't really recieve the deserving screen time at all. Eh, I don't blame Disney for even they couldn't anticipate just how impacting her character would really be upon our society, and that's great because it leaves a lot of potential regarding her character and development in general for future installments. Well, let's move on to the points:   Should she be shown improving as a Queen without depending on her powers?   Of course, it's part of the challenges that her character must confront in the story, therefore crucial to her development. Also, providing us with insight as to how much of an effective ruler she really is, and what she has learned over the time elapsed since Frozen. However, I don't think she should disregard her powers entirely when dealing with her queenly duties as they are just as much a part of her as her status as monarch. Yeah, it would be interesting to see her resolve predicaments without relying on her powers all the time, but it's inevitable that she would apply them to her affairs now that she has finally found her own liberation to utilize them freely without persecution. I think it would be more interesting to see her incorporate her powers into the situations that she deals with as queen and finding a resolution like that. It allows for the development of both aspects of her's.   Are her powers so central they should be a main thematic again?   Well, her powers weren't necessarily the main thematic of the story, rather it being the message that they represented and conveyed. It would be nice to see them expand and further explore that aspect of her's though because there is still a lot of mystery surrounding them that it has the potential to form the premise of a confounding storyline. Yeah, they should be explored further, but not to have the entire plot centered around them. However, the implications here are truly enormous that the number of possibilities are seemingly endless in regards to her powers.   Should Elsa use her powers to improve her ruling?   Of course, like I stated above, they are just as important a characteristic of her's as her status as monarch. They are a challenge that she must learn to overcome and control. Now, of course she should never attain absolute mastery over her powers or else she will have no sense of conflict, but having her try to improve her kingdom only to have it backfire at times could be interesting. She still doesn't have the best control over them, and they aren't the most stable thing after all.   Should she just focus on her abilities and leave the kingdom matters to Kai/Anna?   No, plain and simple really. It's just not Elsa. I can never see her doing this. However, I can imagine her setting time aside to train with her powers though.   Can Elsa really develop both in one movie?   Yeah, I think she could. I personally expect the sequel to be more focused on her development in general.   Which of these two traits you find the most interesting to actually see Elsa developing as?   I like them both really. They are both so crucial to her character that trying to focus on one alone feels like you are not appreciating Elsa entirely as a character."

Frozen,3asenf,DogeyYamamoto,3,Tue Jun 23 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"I have heard a lot of discussion about how ""SJWs"" have been coopting and attacking Frozen on these issues, but for some reason in all of my time spent with actual activists and social justice advocates doing work and outreach, the only time I hear any discussion about these issues with Frozen are on reddit and tumblr posts lambasting the apparent overwhelming number of people calling out these issues, while I have never actually encountered anyone actually claiming these issues are a serious thing in the way you presented them outside of the aforementioned websites."

I was talking about those guys/girls that complain on the internet by misrepresenting the film for arguably trivial things and post stuff like this.  http://jhenne-bean.tumblr.com/post/42832377671/there-is-every-reason-in-the-world-to-get  http://storytellerknight.tumblr.com/post/70157212091/thisiswhiteprivilege-boygeorgemichaelbluth  http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/62918764973/neeta-inari-medievalpoc-mry-j  http://horticulturalcephalopod.tumblr.com/post/72422804429/shadowroseknight24-why-are-we-shitting-on-a-kids  http://waltdisneyconfessionsrage.tumblr.com/post/75488144374/rainbowgoddessme-dinkywitch  http://cactuartamer.tumblr.com/post/38907970356/your-poc-excluding-setting-is-a-choice-and-you  ...and this anecdote might encourage them to keep saying this stuff."
Frozen,3asenf,DogeyYamamoto,2,Wed Jun 24 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling you were talking about people on tumblr and such, and there are undoubtedly bountiful examples of people saying that on tumblr, as before this list I had seen them as well. However, I have seen that ""SJW"" has become a catch all (on this website along especially) to link anyone connected with social justice work with a few people on various social media websites who complain about mostly benign things. What bothers me about comments such as yours was not the dislike of people complaining about something inconsequential like the race of Elsa (I disagree that ethnic diversity is not needed, but thats another matter), but rather that I see the comments being made so often to denigrate anyone who feels that we need any sort of social justice change, with the only backing for the majority of these anti ""SJW"" comments being anecdotes or tumblr posts.   The more involved I get with activism IRL and actual communities working for change, the more I see that probably for ever one person saying that Frozen advocates white privilege or something similar, I see three people lambasting the ""SJWs"" for saying these things. The discussions of these things which detract from actual social justice work tend to be propped up almost entirely by those who feel the need to comment about how stupid ""SJWs"" are, whereas if they just ignored people arguing unnecessary things on the internet those discussions would cease to exist 99% of the time."

Frozen,3asenf,Xator_Nova,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:29:08 2015 UTC,"Of course there is nothing wrong with diversity.  However, it gets annoying when people push some sort of agenda. Let the authors create the work they want instead of forcing them to include it for some sort of correctness. As long as it is not ethnically offensive, I dont see the necessity since gender or race should not define relatability. I never needed a Latin American princess to start with - the Disney Princesses were characters for me before being females or belonging to a certain race."
Frozen,3asenf,VitaminsXYZ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"I understand, and I get that if it becomes too forced (i.e. going off a checklist of every single race/orientation) then much of what the creators are trying to convey may get lost.   But I'm going to have to disagree about gender and race not defining relatablility. Maybe not for you, and that's perfectly fine! But for many others, it does matter. Again, I'm not calling for an immediate change in which every character must be a POC. Just that a step in that direction isn't a bad thing."

I can't find the video, but here's what he said:  I saw that Disney's live-action movie ""Cinderella"" - which also featured a short ""Frozen"" cartoon - came in number one at the box office this weekend, with an estimated 70 million dollars. That story again, a short ""Frozen"" cartoon made 70 million dollars this weekend. And ""Cinderella"" was involved towards the end there, too.  http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Quotables-from-NBCs-TONIGHT-SHOW-STARRING-JIMMY-FALLON-Week-of-316-20150323"

Frozen,3appff,XNinja2017,4,Mon Jun 22 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well, before we can decide what the origin of her powers are, we need to know what they are. There is one possibilty that I wanted to address before I move on to the origins, and I will address it here now. Anyone is free to add on, or correct any of the following information should there be any errors because typing on phone is NOT FUN.   Cryomancy, AKA bullshit magic (But wait! There's more!)   Ah yes, the most accepted idea as to what her powers actually are. We all simply say that Elsa's powers are magic, and accept it for what it is. However, I am not a fan of magic, and being a man with an active imaginative mind, I decided to speculate as to what these powers could actually be. Now, one thing that appears to be fact by following this logic is that she is able to manipulate the very movement of individual atoms since its in the title of what this ability is designated as (Cryokinesis). This feat of the rapid conversion of matter requires a tremendous amount of power, and this is actually supported by her feat when she froze the fjord. The best example in fiction I know of that bears some similarities to Elsa's powers in terms of functionality is the Neural Physics from Halo utilized by the Precursors. These beings are able to conjure structures out of thought much like how Elsa does with her constructs. Also, by utilizing Neural Physics, they were able to create the Flood (the parasite in the franchise) a sentient organism just like how Elsa was able to create Olaf and Marshmellow. I just felt like bringing this up because that's the first thing I thought of when I first watched Elsa use her powers. She may harness the power of something akin to the Neural Physics utilized by the Precursors. I am currently working on explaining these powers using some of the principles in Quantum Mechanics though, and I might bring it up on this sub sometime in the future. No promises though.  Alright, now that that's out of the way. Let's address the main points:   Genetics   It is possible that her condition is hereditary passed on as a recessive gene among the Royal Family of Arendelle. Now, I actually never knew about the inscription on that book and that's interesting because that can be used as evidence to support this theory. Another thing that I found Interesting is how that man on the book was not platinum blonde like how you would expect a cryomancer to be implying that there is no direct correlation between physical appearence and the powers. Based on what we have seen of the lineage being the King, Queen, Anna, and Elsa, we just don't have the adequate information to determine what genes are recessive and dominant. That's coupled with the fact that with what we do see of the Royal Family there appears to be a lot of biological diversity among them as evidenced by the contrasting appearances of the Royal Sisters therefore making it difficult to triangulate the significance of each individual trait. I personally hope that Disney expands more on the Royal Lineage to provide us with some valuable insight to their genetic history. My opinion regarding this theory? I personally don't believe it's entirely attributed to genetics, and I will touch that reason further down.   Deliberate Act   This one is my personal favorite because it actually has some potential if Disney decides to go with it. Besides, I think that the fact that her powers are tied to her emotions seems to kind of dismiss the idea that her powers are attributed entirely to genetics. It may be transferred yes, but not biologically. We all know that the Trolls seem to have some serious knowledge regarding magic as evidenced by when the King and Queen sought the Trolls' consultation. Also, that book that the King looks at before departing the castle seems to imply that magic has played a significant and more prevalent role in Arendelle's past more so than anticipated. I imagine that the two species may have entered a conflict long ago. This could explain why the Trolls prefer to remain secluded from Humanity apart from the cultural differences. That image on the book with the knight could be interpreted differently as well as the Troll inflicting a curse upon the man because that expression on the Troll doesn't necessarily look very pleasent. Perhaps some of the Trolls still felt a grudge against Humanity and kidnapped one of the children of the Royal Family long ago. This theory has so many possible interpretations than the example that I provided here which is why I think Disney should take something like this into consideration.   Arbitrary Circumstance   Well, there is always the possibility that it was just by chance really. It's still possible considering the fact that Disney was about to go for something as random as celestial alignment. Not much needs to be said here really.  This took waaayyyy too long to type that I think I forgot some of the information that I was going to type initially >_>. Oh well, just my two points here, and there is still truly a lot of mystery surrounding her powers that I hope Disney realizes just how much potential there still is with this franchise as a whole.  Great work as usual on the videos!"

Frozen,3appff,LastUniqueUserID,2,Mon Jun 22 22:53:02 2015 UTC,Another great video! And if the Saturn explanation never shows up in the sequel the suggestion that Elsa's ancestor had dormant magic that became active in her could be a neat idea to explore (perhaps he was imbued with magic during the last celestial alignment)?

Frozen,3aq316,Eriflee,4,Mon Jun 22 16:15:26 2015 UTC,Maybe u guys can repost them here. Reunify the fandom
Frozen,3aq316,dragongt1994,5,Mon Jun 22 16:21:55 2015 UTC,Yep. It's not like this sub has so much posts that fanfics will go unnoticed.
Frozen,3aq316,Portgas,6,Mon Jun 22 16:23:59 2015 UTC,Yep all the fledgeling subreddits should transfer to here until the inevitable resurgence with frozen 2
Frozen,3aq316,dragongt1994,3,Mon Jun 22 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"That's weird. /r/hansmasterrace was removed a while ago too, and /r/Tangled too if I'm not mistaken.   However, I disagree that getting removed from the sister subs condemns that sub to a slow death. /r/QueenElsa is still fairly active despite being removed from the sister subs about a year ago, and in the months after its removal, /r/QueenElsa's uniques, page views, and subscribers continued rising even as /r/Frozen's were all falling. It was one of only 7 Frozen-related subreddits (out of 98) whose status was designated as ""Thriving"" in mehmed_el-sanna's Frozen-subs spreadsheet, and that was well after it was removed from the sister subs. Getting removed was not a death sentence."
Frozen,3aq316,CarterDug,3,Mon Jun 22 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"Hm. Interesting.   Actually, I might re-add all those subreddits, I don't know why they were removed if they're still active."
Frozen,3aq316,charredgrass,2,Mon Jun 22 22:26:42 2015 UTC,You should man. There are quite a few subs that could use the aid.
Frozen,3aq316,CarterDug,2,Tue Jun 23 04:54:42 2015 UTC,Just looked at the sister subs. Thanks for adding back /r/FrozenFanfics and /r/QueenElsa. And /r/elselsa is there too!

Frozen,3aoj32,vinjhup,9,Mon Jun 22 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, made? Makes.  I kid, I kid.  But for real; the amount of world-building in Frozen is, in my opinion, responsible for the massive amounts of fanfiction. The amount of material left unexplored by Disney just gives the fans more to explore.  The talented fanartists, and the sense of connectivity, at least for reddit. Remember the singalong threads? Remember the gold-fest? Remember Coronation Week?  Sure, the fandom may be in a sort of hibernation right now until Frozen 2 news comes out, but as you can see, regular content is still being made.   And when Frozen 2 comes out...  Oh boy, do I have big plans for this subreddit."
Frozen,3aoj32,OrangeFeels,4,Mon Jun 22 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"I've been in some and seen many good fandoms and I assure you there are way more than Harry Potter. IMO The biggest difference among them is and will always be, the amount of people.  More people in a fandom means more people writing, drawing, crafting etc... it also means more people on the forums, boards, groups and whatnot.  There are many fandoms that are amazing, but due the limitations on people they are set in small groups that aren't really well known and they can't do much. Small communities also tend to agree more because if you disagree you'll be rolfstomped by the 80% of the people who ""cares"" (Digimon fandom I feel ya ), so there isn't really that much discussion or people who want to discuss something.   Another advantage is also the age and the setting of the characters. One thing that's extremely popular is the ""high school/university"" (young community) vibe certain stories have, full of young characters, Frozen managed that with just 4. This way the fandom mostly speaks to people on the ""right age to work more on it"". I mean, it's not full of kids who mostly don't do a lot of good stuff or can't be on the internet that long , but it's also not full of old people who have more important things to attend. The demographic in Frozen is set full of teenagers and young adults that can work on FF, Fan arts and more because we just have more time in hour hands and we're more passionate about it, isntead of caring more about, let's say, our children.  The only other fandom so big I've been in, has been the warcraft fandom. And I love it, personally it might be more my style. Shipping and FF aren't big over there because the focus is another kind of setting for the characters, not a ""young community"" feel. But no doubt I can say it's an amazing fandom on it's own way and that's because the amount of people and the people that are on said fandom fit the same criteria."
Frozen,3aoj32,Demian_Dillers,3,Mon Jun 22 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is giving in depth answers, but really, I think it's just community. Nothing more. I honestly never expected a place like this to exist on the Internet to be completely honest, and I am glad that I found it. There seems to be a stronger sense of community here then other places that I have seen on the Internet, and I believe this sense of community is what has allowed this sub to flourish and will have it persist long into the future."
Frozen,3aoj32,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jun 22 10:09:40 2015 UTC,I can agree with you there. It's phenomenal how much the movie spoke to so many people (myself included). It gave a lot of people a voice and a place to share it with.
Frozen,3aoj32,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"I can write a really huge comment on why this fandom and Frozen managed to achieve the level that we are now. Unfortunately, I am at work currently and yeah, I can only access this sub via phone >_>. A great example with me is how this is the first Internet forum that I have ever joined, and I have grown to like it here. It's essentially my second home, a sanctuary from my stressful life, and I am sure that others see it in the same way. Indeed, it's truly phenomenal how this film managed to change the lives of many which is why I feel that even after 500 years (Or longer) this film will still be captivating the minds of many."
Frozen,3aoj32,XNinja2017,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:26 2015 UTC,Yeah to some people this may be like the first if not one of the first internet communities they've ever taken part in which makes it that much more special.  The last community for me that I was actively participating in and interacted well with the members there was the Halo community and that was only during the 3/Reach days which were a looooooong time ago
Frozen,3aoj32,Portgas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"I see, I have never been in an online community prior to /r/Frozen. In fact, I have never really strongly interacted with anyone in my life until now. I have lived in minor isolation these last six years or so, so you could imagine how overwhelming and stressful it was for me when I first entered this sub. Things have certainly changed a lot these last few years."
Frozen,3aoj32,dragongt1994,3,Mon Jun 22 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"Lack of original content certainly helped. The world is intriguing and characters are interesting enough to explore and discuss, but not developed enough to diminish the imagination of said discussions. Frozen has a tv series-like fandom in a movie environment. People really want more, they don't have it, so they need to somehow come up more stuff. Sometimes that backfires splendidly, but for the most part it results in some fantastic art and stuff. Frozen fandom is still nowhere near as big or ""rich"" as fandoms of some other popular things, but for one movie it is still damn impressive."
Frozen,3aoj32,paspartuu,3,Mon Jun 22 09:03:46 2015 UTC,Iam relatively new to reddit but isn't this circle jerking that people warned me about? :)))  jk :))  But anyways the fandom is fun :D
Frozen,3aoj32,TheHappyJammer,3,Mon Jun 22 09:20:03 2015 UTC,There's something about Frozen that gets people hooked and inspired and wanting more. I don't have any other explanation for it.
Frozen,3aoj32,Thechris53,3,Mon Jun 22 09:52:42 2015 UTC,"I'd say I am late to the Fandom party, but overall this community has been awesome and caring! The unique position especially here in /r/Frozen all the more makes this experience more exciting."
Frozen,3aoj32,Schadenfreudenous,2,Mon Jun 22 20:52:38 2015 UTC,The positivity of the people here and the positivity of the film. It makes it really easy to keep coming back
Frozen,3aoj32,lolbot720,2,Mon Jun 22 14:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say lack of source content, for one. Past the movie and a few books, there isn't much to Frozen. That prompts the rest of the community to create more. The universe is incredibly interesting, and there are so many paths left unexplored, that we ourselves have to find our own solutions.  Secondly, it's incredibly easy to identify with at least one of the movie characters. Each one has their own flaws and insecurities, just like real people. The community has something to bond over because of it.  We all enjoy a sense of connectivity. We enjoy friendly rivalry over trivial things(shipping, for instance), and we enjoy bonding over something we all like. We enjoy being together, and for many people, that's not something they can easily get. But we can do that here.  Check out /r/RWBY if you're looking for a similar community(we're slightly more...crass, over there. More like a bunch of drunken idiots than happy-go-lucky movie-lovers, but the sense of community is obviously there). /r/darksouls had that feel back in the day too, but I'm not so sure of it now. Worth a shot though."

Frozen,3anzq6,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"Kristoff feels bad for what happened to Anna, so he helps her scape with the promise that she will go away for good. Elsa finds out about that and starts becoming insecure about it, thinking he might always love Anna anyway. She runs away to her palace, Anna betrays Kristoff and returns to Arendelle to take the throne, he must follow a redemption path to bring Elsa back once again and help her to control her powers at full. In the end he shows he he really loves Elsa and after they finally accept their feelings together, she uses her powers at full which helps her defeat her evil sister and then ship her to an impoverished Weselton to marry the Duke's son."

I remember hearing some negative criticism surrounding these films so I am not sure if they are worth checking out."
Frozen,3ansoi,XNinja2017,6,Mon Jun 22 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"The ""original trilogy"" isn't really a thing, the first two, which are by far the best two, were piloted by James Cameron are essentially their own contained story.  The 3rd one picks up the same plot but took it in a direction Cameron has said he disagrees with, Schwarzenegger was the only returning cast member, and with the new director it could almost be considered a reboot/separate timeline. Overall, it's generally considered competent in it's own right, but it doesn't reach the heights of the original two.  Not gonna lie, I can't remember much about Salvation. It's 100% it's own contained story, set in the same timeline but with none of the original cast. It does things right but is definitely considered the worst of the lot. Perhaps worth watching if you have nothing better to do, but it's so disconnected from the rest that it doesn't really add much, just fleshes out the canon.  The upcoming one is a ""sequel"", but also serves as a reboot, it appears to be set in an alternate/new timeline and is recasting all the original characters except of course Schwarzenegger's. We obviously can't say anything for it's quality yet as reviews haven't dropped, but the cast seems solid. (though I personally don't think too highly of Jai Courtney or Emilia Clarke, but that might just be me)  Arnold has also said he only decided to return because he thought the script was really good, so take what you will from that.  Please excuse the wall of text, I know you were only wondering about the recent ones but I can't help myself when someone asks about movies. lel"

Frozen,3anpi9,XNinja2017,4,Mon Jun 22 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"I can already tell you it doesn't even match up with what little we've seen of 'A Frozen Heart'.  Like you said they all look like Hans trying out different looks out of boredom, and none of them is ""freakishly tall with freakishly blond hair sticking straight up"" as Runo is described.

They do look strikingly similar, and this individual is from Tangled yes? IIRC, both verses were confirmed to be intertwined so maybe. I don't know anything about Tangled so I will leave someone else to drop their opinion here. Nice eye though."
Frozen,3anpi9,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's from Tangled, and him and Rapunzel were at Elsa's coronation.  They have a brief cameo during For the First Time in Forever when Anna first walks out of the castle gates."
Frozen,3anpi9,ArendelleKnight,2,Mon Jun 22 01:50:35 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong here, but doesn't Tangled take place sometime in the late 1700's? There could be some truth here to be honest if this claim is true. I understand this whole painting thing whatever is a load of inaccurate crap though, but it's still fun to speculate :p."
Frozen,3anpi9,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  Neither Frozen or Tangled are set in any real world time and place, and they're both full of historical anachronisms, but I think they were going for late 1700's with Tangled as far as the look of Corona."
Frozen,3anpi9,ArendelleKnight,2,Mon Jun 22 02:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know these films tend to disregard historical accuracy, but it's possible to at least establish a rough time-frame. I have never watched Tangled so like I said before, I will leave this to the Disney experts here."
Frozen,3anpi9,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"Frozen was confirmed to take place in the 1840's(two art books confirmed it), and most people seem to assume the exact year is 1844, though I don't know where they get this from."
Frozen,3anpi9,Schadenfreudenous,2,Mon Jun 22 02:47:58 2015 UTC,Here. There are more sources in the comments.
Frozen,3anpi9,HeimrArnadalr,2,Mon Jun 22 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's not set in the real world 1840's, just like it's set in Arendelle, a kingdom based on Norway, but not Norway itself.  It's based on 1840's Norway."
Frozen,3anpi9,ArendelleKnight,2,Mon Jun 22 03:50:48 2015 UTC,How... how would you expect a family to look? o.O
Frozen,3anpi9,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jun 22 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"Not all members would look completely identical. Similarities? Sure, but there is bound to be some biological diversity that would result in some standing out drastically from the group. In this case, it looks like they just took Hans and slapped a bunch of outfits and wigs on him. There is no sense of diversity here."
Frozen,3anpi9,Demian_Dillers,4,Mon Jun 22 01:15:28 2015 UTC,Red Hair... Hand-me down clothes.... must be a Westergard.
Frozen,3anpi9,mavisbangs,2,Mon Jun 22 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"Oh this is pretty cool!. It doesn't seem to fit with the book though, but I liked this more than the stereotypical villain-look-like descriptions the book give us."
Frozen,3anpi9,Drzhivago138,2,Mon Jun 22 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/XNinja2017 that they all look like Hans being copy-pasted and then added some moustaches and different hairstyles. I do not believe that one family would straight up have all redheads even if they are 13 of them! and the mother, oooooh she goddamn looks like a photoshopped Anna!  nope! not mandated by WDAS, not approved by Lee/Buck, so nope! not canon!"

Frozen,3amjeh,Demian_Dillers,7,Sun Jun 21 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"Comments about giving Anna ""fire powers"""
Frozen,3amjeh,BoldlyTheyRode,3,Sun Jun 21 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, my reaction whenever someone suggests that..."
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jun 21 20:51:11 2015 UTC,Exactly what I thought...and their logic makes no sense.
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,3,Sun Jun 21 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, I understand why they would think that. It's just that in the case of Frozen, it's completely redundant and more on the realm of fan-service.  Edit: This phone is a piece of s***."
Frozen,3amjeh,dragongt1994,3,Sun Jun 21 22:15:21 2015 UTC,However Anna having fire powers makes total sense though. Elsa her sister has magic so magic runs in the family. She may have dormant powers that has not manifested yet or have been concealed by previous events. The writers wouldn't retcon things that much. It makes total sense but would be bad story wise and theme wise.
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jun 22 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"What can I say? I am a man of my word.  No, it will never work. Period. I will admit that having her temporarily gain the ability would be interesting, but bestowing this ability upon her permenantly is a definite no. The whole thematic surrounding Anna was that any ordinary person is special. Giving a power to Anna is like killing and continuing to s*** on the corpse of the message that she was supposed to convey. Not to mention that the idea is cliche as all hell. It's just fans trying to seek symmetry in a place that it doesn't belong.  Saying this power runs on the family is a poor excuse considering the fact that we don't even know where these powers stem from in the first place. It could be deliberately bestowed upon someone or via an arbitrary biological process, but it's certainly neither as of now."
Frozen,3amjeh,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 22 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"I know I know, it would be awful for the story and theme. But what iam saying, the very nature of this powers are vague enough for the writers to easily insert it to Anna. The could just say it was genetic and it would pretty much fit in."
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, no one on her family ever seemed to have magic if her parent were so unprepared unless you take OUAT.  Anna having powers would mean the family itself is magical but that isn't the case or purpose on the story. Elsa is just a random special case."
Frozen,3amjeh,dragongt1994,2,Mon Jun 22 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"Well, the King and Queen don't really provide us with the sufficient information required to make out their gene pool with precise accuracy. Now, it could be possible that ""lolmagic"" is a recessive gene that runs among the family therefore making it a hereditary condition. There is insufficient data at the moment to support either though. I personally don't like attributing it to genetics though. I always imagined that it was inserted into the lineage via deliberate act."
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 22 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"This is what iam saying, their history is vague enough to plug in history, fire powers. lots of potential"
Frozen,3amjeh,linden-blossom,2,Mon Jun 22 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"fire powers.   https://media.giphy.com/media/hqOl7UJOVZJUk/giphy.gif  Perhaps it could have worked if they went with it when Frozen was first conceived, but by this point, retconning anything is more of fanservice really. Like I said, it's trying to find symmetry in a place where it's not supposed to exist. Anna's whole message is literally centered around the idea that there is nothing wrong with being ordinary, hence why it will never and with further emphasis never work. There is no potential anywhere for this. The only potential this idea has IMO is if they ever try to expand the history of Arendelle in general."
Frozen,3amjeh,Portgas,9,Mon Jun 22 02:32:06 2015 UTC,"All best to princess Anna, the rarest combination of charm, naivete and overwhelming beauty,"

Frozen,3amjeh,TheHappyJammer,3,Sun Jun 21 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"She's still a little shit, but she didn't do anything wrong in fever AFAIR. After the credits she probably dropped burning soup over Elsa's lap or something though."
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,8,Sun Jun 21 19:04:27 2015 UTC,Then her ice dress melts from the heat... ;)
Frozen,3amjeh,BoldlyTheyRode,7,Sun Jun 21 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"I know you are joking here, but legitimate question here: Would it really?  Think about it, Elsa is able to sustain that ice dress without it ever displaying any signs of melting meaning she must be emanating some sort of ""Ice Field"" to ensure that it remains at a consistent temperature so it never thaws. Also, her powers seem to behave sub-consciously at times meaning that the soup would freeze the moment it comes into contact with her."
Frozen,3amjeh,XNinja2017,4,Sun Jun 21 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"Elsa's powers have always been a mystery. I would argue that some of the stuff she conjures is sentient to some extent like her ice castle and Olaf. As for her attire though, yeah despite the summer heat it still retains its shape. We don't even really know how did she get that power anyway... YES! This looks like the job for..."

Frozen,3aldoz,Demian_Dillers,3,Sun Jun 21 13:02:47 2015 UTC,"She can rule without the use of set clothes though.  The coronation dress seems way too restrictive for showing herself, it's plain and covers her up completely, which she didn't want to be, and while it adjusts to her figure it's not as flattering as her Ice dress. All in all I don't think it's a bad dress but it's not what Elsa wanted to be. I think the open collar in OUAT looked awesome though, and I think she could use that combining it with her new dress creating something awesome, we might see what she wears on the sequel."
Frozen,3aldoz,XNinja2017,2,Sun Jun 21 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, it doesn't portray her in the way she desires, but watching others lust over her in it may shift her opinion about it. I could see her blending the elements of the two styles to create something unique that would conform to her tastes. Elsa possesses a creative mind, and fabricating something like this isn't beyond her capabilities. Frozen II should have her do something like this to give us some more insight to her artistic side."
Frozen,3aldoz,gu1d3b0t,2,Sun Jun 21 19:25:14 2015 UTC,They should do a hybrid dress. Something as elegant and royal as the coronation dress but with an ice motif.

Frozen,3akafs,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jun 21 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"Well Elsa, perhaps people do not invite you because you ignore others, don't dance and always end up making the ambient colder."

Frozen,3al23l,mpsantiago,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:02:00 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I thought it looked familiar.  They should definitely credit the original artist.
Frozen,3al23l,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:01:33 2015 UTC,Credit the artist after receiving permission to modify the work.  Many (most?) artists are very particular about having their stuff altered and repackaged.

Frozen,3aj5u1,HeimrArnadalr,3,Sun Jun 21 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"As far as I know they're just decorations, but in-universe they could be the coats of arms of noble families in Arendelle."

They could put up a list of Elsa (and everyone else)'s personality traits so we could see how close we are to her though. We've had personality quizzes before but that could be cool (pun unintended).

Upon being told in no uncertain terms that the Princess was most definitely not interested in romance or visitors, he decided to snub Arendelle and leave before the coronation. As he was riding back down to the docks where his boat was, he ran into a princess of Arendelle. Not the princess, of course, but still interesting enough to convince him to stick around a little longer."
Frozen,3ahvg3,HeimrArnadalr,8,Sat Jun 20 13:01:56 2015 UTC,I actually don't know xD. Maybe he heard singing and wanted to find the source of it?
Frozen,3ahvg3,XNinja2017,6,Sat Jun 20 11:10:30 2015 UTC,He probably saw her running out the gates and saw his chance.
Frozen,3ahvg3,gazza3478,5,Sat Jun 20 11:50:35 2015 UTC,This makes the most sense.  He was in the early stages of his plan to rule Arendelle.
Frozen,3ahvg3,LastUniqueUserID,5,Sat Jun 20 11:56:37 2015 UTC,Maybe he just got his horse from the boat?

It doesn't seem like something that we need to overthink, but in any case the answer will come on the book in October."

Frozen,3ahrwm,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:51:28 2015 UTC,Depends on whether they'll find somewhere which won't re-encode the episodes to reduce size (and quality) and/or host the huge amount of data it will take up
Frozen,3ahrwm,mavisbangs,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"I guess all they could do is upload it as archives on torrents, but that might take some time to upload."
Frozen,3ahrwm,Portgas,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:30:28 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that. Good points...
Frozen,3ahrwm,Portgas,3,Sat Jun 20 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"I really want to see that 'Defrosting Frozen' featurette, if only just to see more candid moments with our beloved Frozen actors Georgina, Elizabeth, and Scott. And also to see how involved WDAS is in the production since John Lasseter supervised."
Frozen,3ahrwm,gazza3478,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:24:04 2015 UTC,That's what caught my eye too. I'd love to see more of the actors! And I always wanted to know more about John and his visit too :D

Frozen,3ahrwm,ArendelleKnight,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:14:06 2015 UTC,I wish they'd release Season 3 & 4 here in the UK (I imported 3 but it was hella expensive.)
Frozen,3ahrwm,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:03:28 2015 UTC,How much was it?
Frozen,3ahrwm,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"It cost about £30 and then about the same again in customs, our customs is ridiculous."

Frozen,3aguo4,Gareth00144,3,Sat Jun 20 01:33:59 2015 UTC,This looks to be exactly the same as the Zavvi exclusive one we had in the UK (which I have) except that it also included the 3D Blu-Ray.
Frozen,3aguo4,gazza3478,2,Sat Jun 20 09:12:09 2015 UTC,"I was eyeing that one on ebay, but it was about 4 times as expensive as the one that I got! I guess there's a much higher demand for frozen collectors items in the UK. Plus I already have the 3d bluray"
Frozen,3aguo4,gazza3478,3,Sat Jun 20 10:41:39 2015 UTC,"yeha there's a much higher demand as we don't have nearly half as much as the U.S :')  The worst was the limited edition dolls, 250 for ALL of Europe. I've got more than 250 people in my college alone!"
Frozen,3aguo4,gazza3478,2,Sat Jun 20 11:21:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you did get very lucky with those!"
Frozen,3aguo4,gazza3478,3,Sat Jun 20 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't get them. I got the most recent three but there was 2000 of each of them and 1000 of Kristoff, they've learnt their lesson.  I'm never going to get any of the earlier ones, the cheapest one (Winter Coat Anna) is over £400, the most expensive is always at least £1000 (Ice Dress Elsa.)  I hate the people who bought multiples, it completely screws others over."

Frozen,3aguo4,mavisbangs,2,Sat Jun 20 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is the JB exclusive one! JB doesn't sell them anymore, but I found this one on ebay for relatively cheap."
Frozen,3aguo4,damocles2501,3,Sat Jun 20 05:13:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm not going mad then. :)  I'd be right pissed if they were still selling such an exclusive item."
Frozen,3aguo4,magkliarn,3,Sat Jun 20 13:01:51 2015 UTC,How much was it? I got my copy at JB Hi-Fi for about $30 during April last year.
Frozen,3aguo4,damocles2501,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:13:01 2015 UTC,Nice! This one was 50 dollars

Frozen,3aguo4,damocles2501,2,Sat Jun 20 07:09:38 2015 UTC,Barely any movies get the G rating over here
Frozen,3aguo4,magkliarn,2,Sat Jun 20 07:34:21 2015 UTC,probably for violence or scary scenes. Keep in mind that PG here is not like PG13 in the US. We have an M and MA15+ rating that's closer to it.
Frozen,3aguo4,magkliarn,2,Sat Jun 20 09:10:32 2015 UTC,I always wonder when I see physical copies of blurays. Do you have a dedicated bluray player?
Frozen,3aguo4,ChiSoxRox,3,Sat Jun 20 10:40:21 2015 UTC,"::raises hand:: i do.  Then again I don't have a console, and I don't have an optical media reader on my pc.. :p"
Frozen,3aguo4,ArendelleKnight,3,Sat Jun 20 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"...goddammit Damocles, ruining my statistics! :D  Actually quite the opposite, you're the missing link I've been looking for! Was it anything other than the price that made your decision? (Compared to console)"
Frozen,3aguo4,magkliarn,5,Sat Jun 20 13:07:19 2015 UTC,":3 Outlier woo!  I don't game on consoles is the biggest thing.  I had a PS1 back in Secondary School, but since then nothing -- so I'm not tied into any of them in terms of having a library of physical game copies.  Whereas my Steam catalogue... :p  So for me, gaming is on the PC and the Living Room is for the Home Theatre."
Frozen,3aguo4,ArendelleKnight,3,Sat Jun 20 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"PC masterrace brother! Has your wallet suffered this week too?  I'm in a similar position, except instead of no console I do own Nintendo's (which is basically the same thing multimedia wise) and instead of a bluray player I stream HD content to the TV from my computer and services like Netflix. I never saw the point in owning physical blurays but if some day I do I would probably buy a console cuz exclusives."
Frozen,3aguo4,magkliarn,2,Sat Jun 20 13:41:28 2015 UTC,"No dedicated player, I just have a ps3 and it can play both blurays and 3d blurays"
Frozen,3aguo4,vinjhup,3,Sat Jun 20 10:43:40 2015 UTC,Right. It's interesting cause not a single person I've asked has said yes to that question. It's always a console or bluray reader for PC. Much has changed since the times of DVDs...

Frozen,3afjo1,Owyheemud,2,Sat Jun 20 04:06:28 2015 UTC,Ya. They already had Let it Go too which means many other songs were created even earlier than 2011 considering Let It Go was what changed Elsa from a villan to... i forgot the word.   I wonder how far back the modern Frozen was actually started.

Frozen,3acb39,ArendelleKnight,17,Thu Jun 18 23:04:32 2015 UTC,"Omg, this is huge. 2018 seems like a perfect time to release it. I didn't expect it earlier. 5 years between installments is a long time to wait, but quality is worth it."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,8,Fri Jun 19 00:13:10 2015 UTC,"They could've released it earlier, but they couldn't even imagine how big it was gonna be :D, if they do a third part you can expect it 3-4 years after II, not 5."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,5,Fri Jun 19 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, third part is pretty much inevitable at this point. I'm sure we'd get F2 much earlier, if WDAS wasn't busy with Zootopia and Moana already."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 19 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"Probably, it's better they have more time think better and develop more the story though, regardless of the animation process. Still We'll see what happens after the sequel."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,4,Fri Jun 19 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"I rather they take 10 years and make a good movie, than 5 and a mediocre one. Toy story is probably a good case in point."
Frozen,3acb39,greenlamb,2,Fri Jun 19 09:30:15 2015 UTC,"10 years is TOO much to wait with diminishing returns. 5 is optimal, and even that is honestly can be cut down to 3 or 4. The characters are there, the engine and tech are mostly there and all you need is story and songs. And you hardly need 10 years to write 90 pages of script, even if you rewrite it 90 times. Plus the longer you wait the more you'll need to change visuals along the way, since the landscape of cgi changes all the time. TS2 came out only four years after the first one and was great. Shrek 2 came out 3 years after the original and was thrice as good. HTTYD2 came out 5 years after and was amazing. TS3 came out 11 years after and was hardly any better than TS2. I don't think there are many precedents of long gaps between installments meaning better sequels."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 19 09:35:32 2015 UTC,My point is that a good story is more important than a faster sequel. 10 years was just an random number serving as an example.
Frozen,3acb39,greenlamb,3,Fri Jun 19 09:54:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright. Still, more time doesn't necessarily lead to a better story. And it's not like Frozen is Game of Thrones, it doesn't have or need anything convoluted or complicated. They should keep it simple, but nuanced and it'd do well."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 19 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"We have to take into account that sometimes waiting more actually hurt stories though. Be it because authors lose interest, gain new projects, grow older and have other kind of visions, get sick or even die. Even without that when you take too long you start doubting and over-thinking stuff ultimately forcing something after years of not caring enough or stressing about it, so in many ways, actually less time is and would've been much better for a lot of cases regarding the storyline, and thinking the author would've done better with more time doesn't work and it's the contrary. I've seen this way too many times with manga authors sadly."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,3,Fri Jun 19 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"Frozen is ingrained in the pop culture consciousness anyway, so longer wait times in between installments wouldn't affect the public's interest on the franchise. If ever I think it would be like Jurrasic World vs. Jurrasic Park 3 wherein a long wait would just wet people's appetite for more Frozen."
Frozen,3acb39,mavisbangs,6,Fri Jun 19 06:38:11 2015 UTC,If the movies listed here are in order of release Frozen 2 will be out in early 2018!
Frozen,3acb39,OtomeOtome,4,Thu Jun 18 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"I really doubt those are in order. I looked up some release dates and Captain Marvel is supposed to come out November 2, 2018, while Avengers: Infinity War Part I is supposed to come out May 4, 2018."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,5,Fri Jun 19 01:36:44 2015 UTC,"They are in order, the ones from top are over the ones at the bottom instead of being tangled.  That way it is Frozen 2 -> Cars 3 -> Infinity War 1 -> Incredibles 2 -> Black Panther -> Captain Marvel -> Star Wars Spin Off -> Infinity War II -> Inhumans -> Star wars IX .  That way it works perfectly with the Marvel calendar and also with the Star wars calendar. Confirming it even further."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,5,Fri Jun 19 05:44:02 2015 UTC,"Woah! well as you said, then this means it's the earliest Disney film for 2018, that's great!, it's a great time frame! .  We finally know more!.  IMO this is a great move, it leaves more time for them to assert the possible third part of the franchise at an earlier date so it keeps being strong. But also it's not rushed, and I'm sure they consulted with the team first.   This also coincides with Chris' affirmation that an animated movie takes 4 years, but less when is a sequel, this is perfect."
Frozen,3acb39,mavisbangs,2,Thu Jun 18 23:24:27 2015 UTC,how are you convinced that there'll be a 3rd?
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:41:28 2015 UTC,"Never said it was a sure thing :P I said ""assert the possible third part"" because well, it is possible if they determine so after the second."
Frozen,3acb39,HeimrArnadalr,3,Fri Jun 19 14:24:55 2015 UTC,These are going to be three long years. At least we'll have other Disney movies to tide us over until the release.

As numerous fanfiction writers have shown, there is a lot to explore about Frozen, and I'm really excited to see where they might go."
Frozen,3acb39,mavisbangs,2,Fri Jun 19 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"A mature Frozen would be really awesome, and I want Disney to go dark with the story and the characters, just lke how they go dark with 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'"

Frozen,3acb39,GrayWing,3,Thu Jun 18 23:32:51 2015 UTC,Hopefully I have my fanfic finished by then. Damn I'd be mad at myself if I didn't.

Frozen,3acb39,PureSmoulder,2,Fri Jun 19 00:05:24 2015 UTC,Same! Same!
Frozen,3acb39,ricANNArdo,3,Fri Jun 19 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they aren't rushing it out. But I'm also worried since a lot can happen in three years, and I'm not sure if I'll still be hyped for that long.   I'm not sure this sub can hold on for three years."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,3,Thu Jun 18 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this sub can hold on for three years.    Not with that attitude Yeah, seems likely that this subreddit will be on dormant state between that years, but with recent reddit dramas, censorships, and happenings outside of this subreddit (but still inside of this website), it can fasten the necromancy of this subreddit/network, don't forget people ""saturates""(any better word for this?) their favorites over time."
Frozen,3acb39,gazza3478,3,Fri Jun 19 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure this sub can hold on for three years.   The closer to release the livelier it'll get, just you wait. We'll get first trailers at least a year before release, too, so that'd be hype."
Frozen,3acb39,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 19 00:21:47 2015 UTC,There'll also be the EPCOT ride next year!
Frozen,3acb39,gazza3478,4,Fri Jun 19 00:27:49 2015 UTC,And japanese Arendelle or something like that.

Frozen,3acb39,cyberdragon1,2,Fri Jun 19 01:17:41 2015 UTC,This is great!
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,2,Thu Jun 18 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"Huzzah! We finally got a release window :D.... Only thing I'm concerned about is whether or not I will stay interested in this Franchise until then, feel like in 3 years my hype will definitely start fizzling out"
Frozen,3acb39,mavisbangs,2,Fri Jun 19 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"Only thing I'm concerned about is whether or not I will stay interested in this Franchise until then, feel like in 3 years my hype will definitely start fizzling out   Well I think the same, but oh well if we have other interest so be it, we'll be happy about those, if we don't then we'll be happy about Frozen, doubt it's a problem :P. I have held many fandoms for years, and I think Frozen has become my third biggest I guess I don't really forget or get tired of something, which is great for me, so while I might not be actively on the fandom by that date ,  I might still be just as happy. Other fandoms have had to wait more anyway."
Frozen,3acb39,mavisbangs,2,Fri Jun 19 05:45:56 2015 UTC,"well in my case, I stay particularly loyal to ONE fandom for long periods of time, so hopefully by 2018 i still am a fan. Though I believe that my interest would spark once again with its release if ever my hype fizzles out through the years since Frozen's canon itself wasn't ever ruined or tainted by its company, its creators/writers, or by the release of mediocre tie-ins/sequels (unlike some franchises such as Star Wars and Legend of Korra, of which I am once a fan, but as the show decreased in quality storytelling, so did my interest died out completely)."
Frozen,3acb39,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jun 19 06:10:25 2015 UTC,"I have actually seen that Image of the schedules of the various Disney properties, though many derided it as untrue or inaccurate source so that picture didn't really hype me up like it should be expected LOL.   But at least, our guesses were more or less accurate that Frozen 2  would come in 2018 at the earliest and maybe 2019. though with Frozen at the beginning of the schedule, having it a March 2018 release I think wouldn't give it the full maximum potential. Frozen's thanksgiving release was very strategic, taking advantage of the holidays, so if Frozen 2 is also at thanksgiving, maybe the multiplier would increase threefold, since it IS  a hyped up sequel to the highest grossing animated film released on that same holiday 5 years ago. not to mention Frozen 2 should be released at a time of the year when people can make connections with the movie with the cold winter season, which undoubtedly contributed to the original's memetic status and thus, its strong word of mouth."
Frozen,3acb39,tiramisuorigins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:05:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know I think Frozen might want to move on being referenced as a ""Christmas movie"" when it's clearly not, so it could benefit from releasing another date rather than be tied to the cold climate , thus being a strong franchise referenced all year instead of just being remembered one concrete part of it."
Frozen,3acb39,Osoman86,2,Fri Jun 19 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"So the sequel will be most probably be an early summer release. But I hope it would keep its Thanksgiving schedule though. Frozen is pretty much a Christmas movie by now, especially with its winter theme"
Frozen,3acb39,Theroonco,2,Fri Jun 19 06:07:01 2015 UTC,I'm glad Frozen 2 is going to come out but why the hell are they making another Cars movie?  The first one was fine but it does not need to be a franchise.
Frozen,3acb39,doggie015,2,Fri Jun 19 06:48:50 2015 UTC,I'm just surprised they're trying again with that series after Cars 2.
Frozen,3acb39,Jorruss,2,Fri Jun 19 12:32:07 2015 UTC,"I think we already knew Frozen 2 would likely be released in 2018 but it's great to get some confirmation on it. Thank you fof a great find!  November 21st sounds right but I'd like to hope for the earlier slot. I hope other regions aren't left waiting for too long. The UK got Frozen after a month, BH6 and Ralph after three or something..."

Frozen,3adqw8,HeimrArnadalr,5,Fri Jun 19 10:34:24 2015 UTC,"You can be wrong, but not be bad parents.  They were trying to do what they thought was right."
Frozen,3adqw8,dragongt1994,3,Fri Jun 19 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yeh people can be wrong, but the parents never actually said sorry or try to make up for it. Sure they may have if they were alive but they never did. Surely the other parent such as Rapunzel's parents or maybe Merida's parents would have a place."
Frozen,3adqw8,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 19 12:46:04 2015 UTC,"Up until their untimely deaths they were still trying to work with Elsa and, as far as they knew, they were succeeding (no one had died or been frozen)."
Frozen,3adqw8,XNinja2017,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:03:51 2015 UTC,Its still patting somebody on the back saying  'Look at least nobody died' and then giving them a medal.

Frozen,3adqw8,Zook024,2,Fri Jun 19 12:12:54 2015 UTC,Was he in the original much?
Frozen,3adqw8,LastUniqueUserID,4,Fri Jun 19 13:04:12 2015 UTC,I don't see why people think that the King and Queen's actions were considered terrible. They were just afraid and they didn't know what to do.
Frozen,3adqw8,Zook024,3,Fri Jun 19 12:46:19 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone's criticising them for think that - they just take offence with how they went completely the wrong way about dealing with it :P
Frozen,3adqw8,Zook024,4,Fri Jun 19 13:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well, ask yourself this. If you had a daughter that was born with f*** you physics powers and she had absolutely no control over them whatsoever, how would you about to dealing with this issue? I have said this before, they did not know what to do with her, and their decision to consult the Trolls for information shows how far they would go to ensure the best for their children. They were frightened and completely out of options here."
Frozen,3adqw8,dragongt1994,3,Fri Jun 19 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Again, that's fine - they just didn't have...the best solution :P"
Frozen,3adqw8,HeimrArnadalr,3,Fri Jun 19 13:18:38 2015 UTC,"But what exactly was the best solution? Yeah, they didn't make the wisest decision in the film, and I understand how they may be heavily criticized for it, but what else was there to do? I think the fact that they didn't abandon her as a child is enough to prove how much they really care about her."
Frozen,3adqw8,kalcy,2,Fri Jun 19 13:22:58 2015 UTC,Of course they do! :D
Frozen,3adqw8,kalcy,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, I still believe the king was a dope, completely skewing the troll's information to make himself feel safe. He wasn't encouraging control, he was encouraging suppression of who you are by locking Elsa away from the town and having her put gloves on. It's actually similar to Rudolf with his father putting the cover over his red nose. Not controlling it, but suppressing."
Frozen,3adqw8,kalcy,4,Fri Jun 19 12:03:01 2015 UTC,"I never thought it was to protect himself.  He was wrong, but I always thought he was trying to protect Elsa and Anna."
Frozen,3adqw8,sps26,3,Fri Jun 19 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"What makes you feel that instead of ""went about helping her the wrong way""? What he said when he found her with an unconscious Anna (""Elsa what have you done? This is getting out of hand."")?"
Frozen,3adqw8,sps26,3,Fri Jun 19 12:14:19 2015 UTC,"That is what I originally thought, and that's what the writers most likely intended as well. But personally I feel that taking it to the extreme of keeping her away from everyone gave off the impression that he was trying to completely ""correct"" her, and was ashamed of her. Again this is just my own thought process but perhaps he was trying to live with it at first, like you said how he told her ""this is getting out of hand"". But perhaps hurting her sister caused the king to say ""fuck it, this needs to be corrected now"" and while the trolls talked about control, he skewed it to try and permentatly suppress her power."
Frozen,3adqw8,HeimrArnadalr,2,Fri Jun 19 12:32:35 2015 UTC,That's a pretty scary thought...well done!
Frozen,3adqw8,dragongt1994,2,Fri Jun 19 13:09:09 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm telling ya, the king was the true villian of that film ;)"

Frozen,3acxbz,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jun 19 19:53:49 2015 UTC,Maybe we'll get to see it in Frozen 2!
Frozen,3ad0yc,Demian_Dillers,10,Fri Jun 19 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"We need a b*tch fight. Give them something that will test their relationship. Maybe a problem in which they don't have the same opinion of. For example, how about invading a neighboring kingdom. Elsa sees it as preemptive while Anna sees it as being no better than the enemy"
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,5,Fri Jun 19 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, that'd work. I always thought they need something to fight over. These two girls are so different, they just ask for a conflict."
Frozen,3ad0yc,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 19 09:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, I imagine after their 'honey moon' period is over, they may argue even with minor differences."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,3,Fri Jun 19 10:31:29 2015 UTC,That's what any siblings I've ever encountered did. Especially the ones who aren't twins. It'd be weird if they were in tune with each other pefectly.
Frozen,3ad0yc,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 19 12:08:27 2015 UTC,"Would be boring too, and would lose the essence of the characters, so they definitely need things to disagree and ways to develop themselves aside from ""hurr durr sisterhood"".  Conflict also would show they are capable of actually working things out and learning rather than just Elsa giving in to Anna's needs (or the cotnrary) because it's her sister."
Frozen,3ad0yc,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 19 14:37:02 2015 UTC,Of course. The important conflict that will develop and change characters is a must.
Frozen,3ad0yc,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 19 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, that could work to be honest. I regularly mention here how Elsa can steamroll any nation that tries to invade Arendelle (because she can), but I usually disregard ""canon"" Elsa (what can I say? I love the biggatons xD). Like I said on my post, it would be interesting to see how the sisters will act when faced with a situation like this. Anna would probably suggest to use the powers whereas Elsa would probably be more hesitant and try a more diplomatic approach. There is a lot of room for possibility here."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know how Canon Elsa would react to this. But if the nation attempts to threaten her sister safety by an assasination attempt which accidentally hit Anna. Elsa would probably go for the attack. Edit: Anna tries to stop elsa from doing the unthinkable. but is ultimately killed by one fatal strike by Elsa when she was attempting to kill their king. Anna looks at her sister. She couldn't speak but her says eyes says everything u need to know. She dies and Elsa becomes in a dormant state running away to another ice castle control the storm that comes from the void anna left. Her guilt consumes her which  eventually kills her off then reconnects with her sister in the afterlife"
Frozen,3ad0yc,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 19 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think canon Elsa will run, and I am sure that she will confront it head on to be honest. Like I said, I am sure she will try to negotiate with the enemy at first, but if things come to worst then she will attack without a doubt. What I wonder though is how Anna will affect her decision making here when she becomes a variable."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,0,Fri Jun 19 04:20:29 2015 UTC,"Well Elsa has shown to have the capacity to run away so I base my assumptions on that. Having Anna got hurt indirectly because of her plus if in a situation she cause Anna death not once but twice, she wouldn't take it easily, actually nobody would. Elsa from what I can tell is not really emotional strong based on what I can actually take from frozen and even frozen fever."
Frozen,3ad0yc,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 19 05:07:41 2015 UTC,"Elsa from what I can tell is not really emotional strong based on what I can actually take from frozen and even frozen fever.   I disagree, someone emotionally weak would've resorted to suicide after all that shit for 13 years. And wouldn't have returned to normality after just running away or the final act."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,2,Fri Jun 19 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking here with this guy. If Elsa was weak, she would have committed suicide long ago. She endured a long period of self-imposed isolation and oppression to protect her sister. Not only that, she was protecting everyone. That takes some serious perseverance."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:04:26 2015 UTC,"So your saying that a person who seemed to have suppress her whole life is someone emotionally strong?, sure she didn't kill herself but that kind of experience would surely have some form implications in her psyche unless treated by an expert. Even if treated it would take years.  Her whole powers is based on her emotions and took years to have her control it even though her powers seem to be very easy to control. From what I can interpret, Elsa seems to have eratic emotions just because of that ending"
Frozen,3ad0yc,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 19 15:30:49 2015 UTC,"How are they easy to control when she creates random life out of involuntary spasms?. Yeah she was suppressed but she still never shown to be a mess of a person, she still managed to keep her studies to become Queen, keep being proper and not just throw herself crying like most Teenagers would do, she also kept being practical over emotional. Of course she hid her emotions and whatnot and that was bad but she also was able to make a statement for herself, lead a functional life and deal with the consequences without just breaking herself. She doesn't seem to need much more after Frozen although we might see that on the sequel, in any case if she couldn't control the powers is because she couldn't feel loved , but when she realized Anna still accepted her after all that shit, and they both still loved each other she could channel that as the form of control, it was more a case of ignorance as to how to control it and how others felt about her than having problems falling onto bad emotions. As we saw in Fever once she got that information, she was pretty fine and confident."
Frozen,3ad0yc,cyberdragon1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"'*she still managed to keep her studies to become Queen, keep being proper and not just throw herself crying like most Teenagers would do, she also kept being practical over emotional. *'  How sure are you have about her studies, from what I can tell from those Frozen Heart Text, Elsa wasn't really faring any better. In fact it seems worst given that those text shows elsa to be of 18 years old. I though she learned to simply to at least not break down at this point. She was still having those panic attacks or something. I assume they were practicing in controlling her powers but Elsa couldn't keep herself together.  Sure hypothetical that she maintains her studies. That doesn't necessarily make her a more stable person.  Presently she maintains control over her powers, because she had Anna but what if somethings happens to Anna? ' Of course she hid her emotions and whatnot and that was bad but she also was able to make a statement for herself '  What statement? she was just alone in the wilderness when she sang let it go. What statement? the dress? the castle? kind of superficial * it was more a case of ignorance as to how to control it and how others felt about her than having problems falling onto bad emotions* An emotionally stable person would take the though of others less dramatically. Elsa seems to go in a state of panic everytime. It shows clearly through her powers. In frozen fever, nothing was going wrong that much so nothing would push elsa's emotion"
Frozen,3ad0yc,TheHappyJammer,2,Fri Jun 19 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"You know what? Let's go down this rabbit hole...   How sure are you have about her studies, from what I can tell from those Frozen Heart Text, Elsa wasn't really faring any better. In fact it seems worst given that those text shows elsa to be of 18 years old. I though she learned to simply to at least not break down at this point. She was still having those panic attacks or something. I assume they were practicing in controlling her powers but Elsa couldn't keep herself together.   I personally wouldn't use that material from Frozen Heart yet since a lot of that information is still subject to change these subsequent months therefore invalidating your argument further down the line. Although, yes, it does provide some interesting insight into the lives of the sisters, but we should be careful when using material from that novel and presenting it as concrete facts for now. She still persisted really well though despite her life showing no sign of hope whatsoever at that point. Like I said, the fact that Elsa did not commit suicide is enough to support the idea that she is stronger mentally than she looks.   Sure hypothetical that she maintains her studies. That doesn't necessarily make her a more stable person. Presently she maintains control over her powers, because she had Anna but what if somethings happens to Anna?   Actually, yes, it does. Try focusing on your studies as the next heir to the kingdom while simultaneously dealing with a dangerous power that has the capability to seriously injure those that you are supposed to lead while keeping this all in secret. She had all this going on in her head that I am absolutely astounded that she was able to retain her sanity. I have mentioned before in another thread that Anna is indeed like her ""Achilles Heel"". However, saving her sister would motivate her to fight harder rather then succumb to her emotions. This alone is evidenced by what she endured during her period of isolation in the film.   What statement? she was just alone in the wilderness when she sang let it go. What statement? the dress? the castle? kind of superficial    Conceal, Don't Feel   An emotionally stable person would take the though of others less dramatically. Elsa seems to go in a state of panic everytime. It shows clearly through her powers. In frozen fever, nothing was going wrong that much so nothing would push elsa's emotion   The only instances that she went into a state of panic were whenever Anna was hurt, and the revelation of her powers. Beyond that, not much. As for Frozen Fever, yes, there was. Normally, ruining something would make her feel down, but after Anna assured her that everything was going to be fine she seemed okay with it. That implies character development.  In conclusion, she is far from weak dude."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"She managed to actually learn what was necessary to become a Queen since no one ever was worried about her readiness. Given how cases exist of teenagers suiciding or leaving, due stress that's actually a lot of fortitude. She never needed drugs, she never went to a psychiatrist and she still managed to grow up into a functional human being. Functional enough to go trough the most stressful day on her life with enough normality until Anna started making a scene and her powers activated due fury.  I don't think she'd die if something happens to Anna,once again now she knows  how to deal with her powers , before she didn't she was scared and traumatized as a child but that can happen to anyone strong or not. Let it go was about choosing her life, and her own solution to a problem when the kingdom wanted her as a criminal.   I don't see how Elsa was being dramatic when her emotions were justified. Why wouldn't she fear the revelation of her powers or the fact that she was freezing an entire kingdom? Or the fact that her sister was dead?. There was not one instance on Frozen when she reacted out of nowhere."
Frozen,3ad0yc,Eriflee,3,Fri Jun 19 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"We should definitely see them bond a lot more over the course of Frozen 2, but one thing that I think would be great would be the sisters hiding secrets from each other, especially Anna. Maybe Anna has something or is doing something that she doesn't want to openly share with Elsa, and that could be a catalyst for future exploration in their relationship.      Also a b*tch fight like /u/dragongt1994 said"
Frozen,3ad0yc,XNinja2017,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"How about a full scale civil war? Unlikely, but cool to see happen."
Frozen,3ad0yc,Eriflee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yep a real fight would be awesome. I love the fluff and all but sometimes getting angry is good too :D, /u/TheHappyJammer a civil war between the sisters would be awesome too see. I am also willing to bet Elsa would be the one to hide a secret because she has shown actually hide things from her sister be it her powers or just being sick. This would be also a good reason for a fight."
Frozen,3ad0yc,dragongt1994,5,Fri Jun 19 05:02:38 2015 UTC,"I see them spending every waking moment together, holding hands together in the market. Dining together. Anna sitting by Elsa's side in the throne room. Building snowmen. Anna lying on Elsa's lap under a tree as the older girl holds a book with one hand, while her other hand is tangled in Anna's hair. And finally, Elsa snuggling with Anna to sleep every night."

Frozen,3a956c,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:48:16 2015 UTC,Everyone loves Elsa!
Frozen,3a8ptk,Demian_Dillers,8,Thu Jun 18 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"Sister duet, definitely. I was surprised by how much I loved MTaPD. Kistanna could work if it was them both out on the ice, kind of like that art I saw a while back of Kirstoff and Anna with her hair down working on the ice."
Frozen,3a8ptk,craft6886,3,Thu Jun 18 03:01:30 2015 UTC,I don't like a song about Kristoff and Elsa singing about 'ice'. Sounds like something for a miniseries. Maybe a kristanna song if the plot requires it. a 'War' song would be good if there is an actuall battle. More songs like 'do you wanna build a snowman'. Something emotional that would make me cry just by hearing it.
Frozen,3a8ptk,dragongt1994,3,Thu Jun 18 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Personally I would like less songs, I was really happy that the film didn't have more songs after fixer upper, specially one that would ruin the crude moments. I loved how it was wrapped up.  I know however the film might have the same amount or more songs due the popularity of the Frozen soundtrack.  Anyway I'd like a sisterly song of course, but hopefully it isn't full of them. It would need to be a fun one.  I'd like solo songs for both Elsa and Anna, powerful as let it go dealing with their problems. A Kristanna song is almost a given, they didn't have one as every other disney couple, it would be nice  nonetheless. I'd like to hear more of Kristoff to be honest, that voice is great!.  Elsa having songs with whoever and more would be great, She only had small parts and let it go (well ""only"" Let it go) so she needs more now.  I also hope songs aren't as expositive as MTAPD or DYWBAS , hope they aren't awkward but more sentimental, and fitting in context and outside context , that make you feel the characters, of course we're bound to have silly songs but hopefully they keep it like Frozen with the songs actually making sense at most moments rather than just ""happening"" like in other Disney films."
Frozen,3a8ptk,dragongt1994,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:05:22 2015 UTC,What do you mean expositive?
Frozen,3a8ptk,dragongt1994,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"Very describing and explicative, Elsa singing what she did for the birthday, or Anna singing how her life was without building snowmen."
Frozen,3a8ptk,cyberdragon1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"Ah I kind of like that, broadway esque. If a song can be easily taken out of the film, it doesn't fit much as a song for a musical"
Frozen,3a8ptk,XNinja2017,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not keen of musicals so that's why I don't like it I guess :P. We're bound to have at least one but I hope they don't go that style all the way. I liked the songs still make sense to be ""happening"" without being just randomly awkward though."

Frozen,3a8ptk,TheHappyJammer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:17:29 2015 UTC,Best answer right here.
Frozen,3a8ptk,ArendelleKnight,2,Thu Jun 18 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"If Hans returns, then it would be cool if he got his own song. The duet with Anna was nice, but having him perform his own song would be great. Then again, this depends entirely on the context of the scene/movie so yeah.  For others, well another song conveying a profound message by Elsa would be nice, and as mentioned here a duet between Anna and Kristoff would be nice as well. I think Elsa deserves the spotlight for the sequel so she should certainly get another song.  Overall though, I would like for there to be a good balance with the songs in terms of emotion. Frozen did this pretty well and I think they will do the same with the sequel too. I am also looking forward to the ambient music though. Some people seem to forget how much it helped to set up the mood in the film, and it complimented the scenes really well making them much more powerful."
Frozen,3a8ptk,paspartuu,2,Thu Jun 18 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a villain song. Hans didn't get a traditional villain song and Let It Go wasn't villainy enough, and I'd really like to have something along the lines of The Mob Song or Hellfire.    And you like the film to have the same kind of arrangement, without songs at the end?   No. Frozen started out strong in terms of songs. Frozen II should be strong all the way through."
Frozen,3a8ptk,dragongt1994,2,Thu Jun 18 03:31:49 2015 UTC,Regarding instrumental music they should be like these... I hope so at least.

That said, there are characters I don't mind seeing together, like this pair here. Light shipping is fun, I think. I just like to play the serious shipper.  I love fanart though.

I've gotten just about everything else down in the past few months.   As to what I want to draw next, I'm mainly working on character designs for a webcomic, but have a few OC characters for RWBY and Frozen waiting in the pipeline(faces I've been getting down.

Frozen,3a4q1s,BartyMae,3,Wed Jun 17 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"She's Pixar but she came right after Disney bought Pixar, soo she ended up being included given she was a semi-popular princess. Less popular princesses are not included as to not cheap the brand, while Giselle is not included due the fact they would have to pay royalties to Amy. Anna and Elsa are not included because they are too popular, Frozen is too big of a brand on it's own now so there's no need for them to include the Arendelle Royalty.   You see, the princesses franchise serves to consolidate and let these old popular but not-so-much heroines sell much more and gain representation. Frozen on it's own represents over 15% of Disney's earnings, that's a lot and the brand is so big putting them into the princess line would actually weaken them due the meanings associated with said line and the sharing of products. So it's a good thing Elsa and Anna aren't included, when they get to be, will mean Frozen has weakened or just enough time has passed and they can't wait anymore :P."

Frozen,3a49p7,XNinja2017,3,Wed Jun 17 03:33:57 2015 UTC,Best Disney sidekick IMO.
Frozen,3a49p7,vinjhup,6,Wed Jun 17 10:09:10 2015 UTC,It does not sound very compelling. Besides Frozen II should be all about Snow Queen Elsa.
Frozen,3a49p7,Sylra,3,Wed Jun 17 07:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agree here. Anna already had her chance, and well, Olaf doesn't really have any significance beyond representing the sister's childhood."
Frozen,3a49p7,dragongt1994,2,Wed Jun 17 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, well maybe not all, but  definitely highlight Elsa as a character. I'm gonna do a discussion thread related to that later, but I'm not sure how said thread will go."

Frozen,3a49p7,ArendelleKnight,5,Wed Jun 17 05:46:57 2015 UTC,It has potential for a good short.
Frozen,3a49p7,ArendelleKnight,3,Wed Jun 17 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"Well, true enough."

Olaf has to deal with heavy stuff.  Olaf: oh look a flower."

Frozen,3a49p7,Sylra,3,Wed Jun 17 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be happy about it, I'd hate the idea.  Would you like this (well, not exactly this, but an Olaf/Sven movie) as an spin off that doesn't affect the main Frozen, made by Disney Toons though?"
Frozen,3a49p7,Portgas,5,Wed Jun 17 03:35:56 2015 UTC,"If I were going to trust Disney Toon Studios with any part of the Frozen universe it would have to be a less important character than Olaf or Sven.  I'm talking background characters here, Percy, Claire, William, 'Why do I Have to Wear This' Kid, Random Arendelle Guard #5.  Maybe Anna can walk by in the background or something, but that's about as much as I trust them with any of the main characters. :P"
Frozen,3a49p7,LastUniqueUserID,3,Wed Jun 17 04:10:27 2015 UTC,"Oh haha. Ok then, How about a Disney Toons Movie about the Duke or Hans? :P."
Frozen,3a49p7,XNinja2017,4,Wed Jun 17 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think I can predict what those movies would be if they were made by Disney Toons.  The Duke's movie would be about his backstory and the reason he fears magic.  Some number of years before the events of Frozen a generic evil sorceress (an extremely thinly veiled clone of early Evil!Elsa, probably named either Esla or Asle) invaded Weselton for reasons.  The Duke would of course be the hero who saved Weselton, and after that he mistrusted anyone with magic.  Hans' movie would be a forced redemption story that would make Hans fans (and nobody else) happy.  It would probably involve some bullshit justification for his actions that completely retcons what he did in Frozen, and it would also likely suggest he was in love with Elsa the entire time, even when he tried to murder her with a sword.  Nope."
Frozen,3a49p7,cynthash,3,Wed Jun 17 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"Mmm how about. ""Weselton."" A movie about treachery and cunning.  In the movie the young duke competes with a cunning and merciless merchant rival in order to gain control of Weselton. A complete comedy like those of old times where both parties try to destroy each other and win the support of the public/a king by any means in the end the other party is somehow more evil than the Duke and in the end the man we know wins. The movie ends with him planning to win more allies and win more riches. There's no hero. We also discover he fears magic because his rival used magic to sink one of his ships.  And Hans haha nah I doubt Disney toons would make him fall for Elsa. And I'm sure many Hans fans would hate if he became good.  How about Hans, a story of the Prince who escapes the Southern Isles planning his revenge on Arendelle. He joins a ship that's sailing for finding new lands in order to re-establish his mind a little. There, he discovers the captain is a very rich man and one that has a giant fleet filled with an Army, Hans believes that's a waste. He tries the whole movie to plot against the captain managing to cause a mutiny the loyal men of the captain fight against Hans' new followers, and in an epic battle the good captain defeats Hans. A story about a villain that's ultimately defeated because evil doesn't take you to good places, Hans ends up abandoned along the traitors in a deserted island."
Frozen,3a49p7,cynthash,2,Wed Jun 17 05:11:24 2015 UTC,"Either of those could be potentially decent side movies, but I'm sure Disney Toons would do them in the worst way possible.  Really though the Duke doesn't even need a backstory or an explanation as to why he hates people with magic.  I just assume a lot of parts of that world aren't very accepting of people with magic, and that Weselton is one such place.  As for Hans I'm perfectly happy for him to never be seen again.  He's back in the Southern Isles, he's shoveling horse shit, he's where he belongs, leave it at that.  If he does come back it should be as a completely ineffective villain, trying again to take the throne of Arendelle and getting owned in the first 10 minutes of the movie. :P   And Hans haha nah I doubt Disney toons would make him fall for Elsa.   I don't know, it sounds to me like something Disney Toons would do.   And I'm sure many Hans fans would hate if he became good.   What's the alternative?  He comes back as a completely ineffective villain?  I'm sure Hans fans don't want that either, but that's what he'd be since his major advantage in the first movie was manipulation and that won't work with Anna and Elsa anymore."

I just assume a lot of parts of that world aren't very accepting of people with magic, and that Weselton is one such place.

That would be perfect. Oh well after that Fever scene though I'm sure Disney won't really show it other way, they take him as a joke already.   I don't know, it sounds to me like something Disney Toons would do.   Mmm I don't see it, there's no reason for them to do that really, although I could see them getting him a partner who isn't' a princess so he learns that crowns aren't important and stuff.   What's the alternative? He comes back as a completely ineffective villain? I'm sure Hans fans don't want that either, but that's what he'd be since his major advantage in the first movie was manipulation and that won't work with Anna and Elsa anymore.   His major advantage was surprise element :P. I'm sure many Hans fans don't want him to return, I don't hate the char actually, I like him on his simple role so I don't want him to return to become a rocket team-like villain. That would be cheap for the entirety of Frozen."

True, same Hans actually he doesn't really need a backstory, people want power all the time, their motives were pretty explicit in Frozen anyway.   He doesn't need one, but there's more potential for something interesting in his backstory than there is for the Duke IMO.  If nothing else we'll learn more about the Southern Isles and the rest of the Westergaards in 'A Frozen Heart'.   Same as you, I don't want him to come back really, not even as a bad villain, that would take significance to Frozen, unless it's a little cameo like in Ferver. That would be perfect. Oh well after that Fever scene though I'm sure Disney won't really show it other way, they take him as a joke already.   Well the only reason I would like to see anything like that is to show him as an ineffective villain and show how much more powerful Elsa is now, like if he came in with an army and tried to invade Arendelle and just got wrecked like I said in the opening minutes of the movie.  The idea is we would see how powerful Elsa is before introducing a villain on her level.  I guess that wouldn't really work anymore though, since we know Hans was punished for what he did, and he certainly isn't in any position to lead an invasion of Arendelle.  Maybe the Duke could fill that role, he just brings Weselton's navy into Arendelle and they don't even get a shot off.  Elsa freezes the fjord, freezes their canons, lowers the air temperature, basically casts a focused eternal winter just on Weselton's navy until they surrender.   Mmm I don't see it, there's no reason for them to do that really...   There's no reason for them to do a lot of the things they've done really. :/   ...although I could see them getting him a partner who isn't' a princess so he learns that crowns aren't important and stuff.

Yeah that could be cool I agree.   There's no reason for them to do a lot of the things they've done really. :/   Yeah I know,  but I mean there would be no storyline purpose for that, the story would  just be clunky with that unnecessary detail and it's not like their story could benefit. The only reason to ever to that is to make Helsa happen.   I don't hate the character either. I mean I do hate Hans, but he's a good villain for the first movie, he would just be a complete joke if he returned, either that or he would be redeemed which I don't want to see happen.   Yup, pretty much, his return serves no purpose really and would just be fanservice or disgrace. We're pretty much better exploring new chars. Hans purpose as a vehicle villain has been fulfilled and there's no need for more to it really. Good thing we're on the same page there."

Frozen,3a39cs,AnonnyMiss,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:48:04 2015 UTC,I suspect it will be just like Pokemon Puzzle League. It was a puzzle game very similar to the current Frozen Free Fall where they cashed in on the biggest kid franchise of the time by using the characters & setting in the game. It is called Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight so it likely has some head-to-head combat like in Pokemon Puzzle League.
Frozen,3a39cs,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jun 17 07:19:59 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant to the topic I know, but are you a Pokemon fan?   Well anyways, I loved Frozen Freefall, but then I realized how annoying and frustrating the lives thing got. I was going to hack the game for infinite lives, but I decided not to. Got to IIRC stage 19 with like no effort, and then the game suddenly started kicking my ass :p. Eh, I plan to get back to it someday because I really enjoyed it. Still great the we are getting a Frozen console game though, but I would really like something more adventure oriented. Have you played that Frozen adventure game on Disney's site? Something like that that would take you through the events of the movie would be amazing to have on console."
Frozen,3a39cs,AnonnyMiss,2,Thu Jun 18 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"Oh my, yes! Been playing the games back since Pokemon Red, became disconnected with the franchise by around 2005/2006, to only accept my childhood love affair come late teens. I am critical of the current direction of the series since the unnecessary introduction of mega evolutions...  I'm not too keen on run-of-the-mill platformers. Give me world-exploration Mario. My niche is cartoon racing & relaxing day-by-day games (Animal Crossing & Harvest Moon).  Most gamers stay away from games based on films or television series. Those are nowadays programmed with little creativity or fun- they are just trying to capitalize on the trend & dumb consumers."
Frozen,3a39cs,XNinja2017,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:53:32 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. I was the same too. Nintendo is my childhood, and I still love to play their games even now. I left the franchise at least three times in my life only to come back to it again and again. Yeah, I have mixed opinions on mega-evolution, but I really need to try it myself to make any judgments. I hope to buy a 3DS with either one of the remakes in the future. I loved the 3rd gen, and Emerald was by far my favorite of the games. Yeah, I am a Pokemon fan too :p, but I am no competitive gamer although I do have a lot of knowledge there. I don't think we should worry though because I really like all the newly introduced Pokemon. This time they seem to have taken a quality over quantity approach. Hey, have you played Smash Bros before? One of my favorite games of all time since I was a child haha, and yeah, I can play it pretty damn well.  I love world exploration games as well, and I still enjoy a lot of the ones on the N64. Well, as for me, I don't seem to have a niche really. Though I did play a lot of FPS games back in my teen years (not the slow modern ones, but the old arena shooters like Unreal Tournament, Quake, etc) as well as the really fast futuristic racers, but I have been moving away from those genres lately to more relaxing games like the ones you mentioned. Doesn't mean I don't know how to play anymore though. The muscle memory is still there and I occasionally play with the godlike AI every now and then ;). Yeah, I play Minecraft a lot too, but mostly creative mode. It helps relax the mind, and alleviate stress.  I agree there, which is a shame considering the fact that they have such great potential. Take a look at Goldeneye on the N64 for instance. That game was fantastic, and it should serve as an example to modern developers just how much potential these games really have."

I had some altitudes set up but need some more fixing. Edit: the red dots are major cities in the arendelle kingdom. Strategicall placed in crossroad as well as some resources for such a city to flourished. One particularly big settlement is probably the one near the farm lands."
Frozen,39zhx9,LastUniqueUserID,9,Tue Jun 16 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"I noticed this before this guy, but I always attributed it to the scene transition. The scene appears to transition right before we see the blast form a full circle, and that doesn't seem like the only area with a lower concentration of ""Ice Magic"". The energy isn't exerted in a uniform manner. There are irregularities all over the blast, it being most prevalent in the side that Elsa is facing near the end of the sequence. There doesn't really seem to be anything significant here to be honest, but it's still an interesting analysis."
Frozen,39zhx9,XNinja2017,6,Tue Jun 16 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"After I read this, I actually went back and looked at the scene frame by frame.  It really does look like there is significantly less ice projected in Anna's direction, even though the overall blast is very irregular.  Whether that's by design or not is debatable, but if you look at it full screen frame by frame, it really does seem legit."
Frozen,39zhx9,XNinja2017,4,Tue Jun 16 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"My Internet is being absolute s*** right now so I can't really watch the scene right now.  Yeah, which is why I am not dismissing this entirely yet. The issue I have with this though is the fact that the scene appears to transition over to Anna right before the blast goes full 360. Another problem with this is that the subsequent scene clearly shows that the blast directed at Anna is just as concentrated as all the other regions. So far, there doesn't really seem to be anything here."
Frozen,39zhx9,XNinja2017,3,Tue Jun 16 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"You really got me wondering about this, so I took a screenshot of the last frame, just before the scene changes.  Based on this, I think the argument can definitely be made that this area is the last to receive the ice blast.  As far as the actual concentration of the blast, there's really no way to know for sure, since the scene transitions just before it engulfs that section.  Either way, it's an interesting analysis."
Frozen,39zhx9,TheHappyJammer,3,Tue Jun 16 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it doesn't go full 360 prior to the scene transition. On that shot, it stops somewhere around 10 degrees under 360 and the scene moves on to Anna. Also, look at the shot I posted and notice the impacts of the ice on the wall behind Anna. It's actually concentrated more on Anna."
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,3,Tue Jun 16 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't notice the link on your previous post.  I see what your saying.  In that shot the ice which strikes Anna is brighter, and therefore appears more concentrated.  However Elsa is facing in the opposite direction, so I think it's fair to assume that she was trying to avoid harming Anna.  Also, after watching the scene multiple times in slow motion, it looks like the brightest area follows the blast, from the front of Elsa and around the back as the blast moves 180 degrees around her on both sides."
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,5,Tue Jun 16 02:52:35 2015 UTC,I may make a video about the complexities of Elsanna (All aspects of it) in the near future.
Frozen,39zhx9,dragongt1994,4,Tue Jun 16 01:25:15 2015 UTC,I look forward to that!  You could probably even do a miniseries on it.  There are so many different angles to explore.
Frozen,39zhx9,dragongt1994,3,Tue Jun 16 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"Actually this makes sense, since we see how Elsa turns around to not face Anna, she probably felt the magic leaving her and thought it wouldn't scape through her back, while it doesn't seem  she really hit Anna with less force it does seem like she tries to avoid hitting her due her positioning, if nothing else."
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,3,Tue Jun 16 02:51:06 2015 UTC,"I just watched this scene multiple times in slow motion.  I think the argument could also be made that the ice only emanates from the front of Elsa, but then as the pressure builds up in front of her it is forced around her in all directions.  And it does definitely appear that the section where Anna was standing was the last section that felt the force of the blast."
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,3,Tue Jun 16 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah she was facing Elsa's back, Elsa probably wasn't expecting such release from her body."
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,2,Tue Jun 16 04:11:24 2015 UTC,Yeh this is an extreme case of overthinking. This could have easily been an artistic choice.
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,2,Tue Jun 16 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but what exactly do you mean by an artistic choice?  Are you referring to the way the ice is dispersed, the direction that Elsa's facing, or all of it?"
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,2,Tue Jun 16 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, frame, timing of the ice hit like its building up to hit Anna. I think it was all just cinematography. Elsa clearly has no control. To say that Elsa has much control over her powers in that crucial moment is ridiculous. I think this author seems to put Elsa on some high pedestal"
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,2,Tue Jun 16 04:33:56 2015 UTC,"I think the author went a little overboard in his/her assessment, however I wouldn't necessarily say Elsa has no control.  She was facing the opposite direction, and the ice originally emanated from the front.  That could be a coincidence, but it also could be that Elsa turned away from Anna in an attempt to protect her.  And you're probably right about the author putting Elsa on a pedestal, but I kind of do that too.  Maybe that's why I'm mostly in agreement with this."
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,2,Tue Jun 16 04:46:41 2015 UTC,"XNinja hit all the main points. There are irregularities all over the blast, the shot cuts before we see the last part of the blast mature, and the most damning evidence is the very next shot which shows that Anna got a meatier part of the blast relative to the sections around her.  https://imgur.com/a/R4jPR#0  Although gaps appear initially throughout the blast, they eventually get filled in as the blast matures, creating a more uniform blast. The shot cuts before we see the back end of the blast mature. But we can see in the next shot that Anna appears to get a meatier part of the blast relative to her surroundings."
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,3,Tue Jun 16 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"When the scene changes we only see a relatively narrow view of the overall blast.  In the section that we do see, it appears that Anna takes the brunt of the blast, but it's difficult to know for sure.  Also, unless Elsa was aware that the strongest area would develop behind her, it would seem natural to think that by facing in the opposite direction, Elsa was trying to protect Anna.  Also, Elsa seems genuinely surprised when she turns around and sees that Anna is injured, which seems to indicate that she believed she had shielded Anna from the blast."
Frozen,39zhx9,CarterDug,3,Tue Jun 16 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"but it's difficult to know for sure.   If we're using the whiteness and transparency of the blast in the first shot to say that Anna is receiving the least intense part of the blast, then it would be unfair to not use that same metric when judging the blast intensity in the second shot. Either we use that metric for both shots or we don't use it for either shot. Based on the same metric we were using in the first shot, Anna is clearly receiving the brunt of the blast relative to the parts we see around her.   it would seem natural to think that by facing in the opposite direction, Elsa was trying to protect Anna. Also, Elsa seems genuinely surprised when she turns around and sees that Anna is injured, which seems to indicate that she believed she had shielded Anna from the blast.   It's not even clear to me that Elsa knew she had sent a blast or that she struck Anna again. She seemed too busy flipping out. Before she sends the blast, she's spinning around in circles with her eyes closed. If you've ever done that before, you know how hard it is to judge which direction you're facing. I don't think she knew where Anna was when she sent the blast.  And when Hans tells her that she froze Anna's heart, she seems surprised and confused (""How?""). If she knew she had sent a blast, and that Anna had been hurt by it, I don't think she would have been so confused by Hans's revelation. I think if Elsa even suspected that she may have struck Anna with a blast, she would have spent a lot of time dwelling on it, so by the time Hans revealed Anna's condition, it wouldn't even be a shock to her. It would just be confirmation of her deepest fear.  Edit: AC, SGPFC"
Frozen,39zhx9,Demian_Dillers,3,Tue Jun 16 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"Either we use that metric for both shots or we don't.   I'm not saying that the same metric shouldn't be used to judge the intensity of the blast.  I'm simply saying that in the wider shots from above, we're seeing an overall view of the blast, albeit for only a few frames as the blast develops.     Anna is clearly receiving the brunt of the blast relative to the parts we see around her.   When the shot changes to Anna, it is a very narrow view and for only a few frames.  It appears that focus of the blast begins at the front of Elsa and then gradually travels around her, with greater force to her left.  If there had be shot directly to Elsa's left as the blast reached that area, it would have appeared to take the brunt of the blast.  In the end, it does appear that Anna may have suffered the same amount of damage no matter where she stood, but it seems a little too coincidental to me that Elsa was facing almost completely in the opposite direction, and that the blast reached the area where Anna stood last."
Frozen,39zhx9,Illuminatrix618,2,Tue Jun 16 04:57:29 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying about the narrowness of the shot.   it seems a little too coincidental to me that Elsa was facing almost completely in the opposite direction, and that the blast reached the area where Anna stood last.   To me, that seems like an artistic decision rather than a coincidence. If Anna had been anywhere else, it wouldn't have looked as good, and it would have thrown off the timing of the scene. And like I said in the other comment, I'm not even convinced that Elsa knew she had sent a blast, where Anna was when she sent the blast, or that it struck Anna.  Edit: SGPFC"

It would just be confirmation of her deepest fear.   But she did see Anna hit after the release, since she saw her on the floor and was worried about her, and even Saw Kristoff run to help Anna, she had other things in mind to worry though. Elsa also seemed breathless so she did felt the energy leave her body, I just think Elsa was shocked by the revelation."

Frozen,39ym79,Chris857,3,Mon Jun 15 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"I would comment, but there are too many already so I just don't bother. Nice thread btw."
Frozen,39ym79,XNinja2017,3,Mon Jun 15 22:54:37 2015 UTC,Thank you! :) I guess the Constable Conspiracy is just so large I guess... so many possibilities! xD

Frozen,39zrjl,Demian_Dillers,8,Tue Jun 16 02:44:11 2015 UTC,The object on my right is a 200-pound fatass. I'd push him into Hans and make my hasty escape.
Frozen,39zrjl,Eriflee,2,Tue Jun 16 02:56:40 2015 UTC,Best answer
Frozen,39zrjl,LastUniqueUserID,6,Tue Jun 16 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"I have a pillow, my cat, and a bow. I use the bow, and I don't hesitate to headshot the bastard."
Frozen,39zrjl,XNinja2017,6,Tue Jun 16 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"My cat is next to me. I'll throw it Hans and hopefully he has some sort of allergic reaction to cats. Unfortunately my cat is declawed and scared of strangers so throwing a cat at Hans might not help much.   If I'm going to die, I might as well go with style. I'll stand proud and shout, ""Long live Queen Elsa!"""
Frozen,39zrjl,TeleVue,4,Tue Jun 16 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"My cat is aggresive as hell with strangers, and he still has his claws. Hans will learn true fear."

Frozen,39zrjl,ThompsonBoogie,4,Tue Jun 16 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'd have to through my cell phone at him, but first I would open some really erotic Elsanna porn.  That should distract him long enough for me to make my escape."
Frozen,39zrjl,LastUniqueUserID,5,Tue Jun 16 04:21:56 2015 UTC,Are you sure you won't end up distracting yourself as well?
Frozen,39zrjl,Eriflee,5,Tue Jun 16 04:43:59 2015 UTC,I guess I really didn't think this through.
Frozen,39zrjl,LastUniqueUserID,3,Tue Jun 16 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Open your handphone, shout at Hans, ""I got a screenshot of Georgina Haig and Elizabeth Lail making out as Elsa and Anna!""  Throw your phone in a direction then run like hell."
Frozen,39zrjl,Eriflee,3,Tue Jun 16 05:17:10 2015 UTC,That could work!
Frozen,39zrjl,LastUniqueUserID,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:48:34 2015 UTC,Unless Hans likes boys...then he probably would just not care.
Frozen,39zrjl,Ep1cSpray,2,Tue Jun 16 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"That is a really good plan, good good that should help."
Frozen,39zrjl,Superjoshe,2,Tue Jun 16 04:40:17 2015 UTC,I have a bowl of ramen noodles. I guess i could kill him with the spoon.
Frozen,39zrjl,I_LOVE_CATS_AMA,2,Tue Jun 16 03:32:07 2015 UTC,I have a nightstand upon which lies a pocketknife.  It'll have to do.
Frozen,39zrjl,dragongt1994,2,Tue Jun 16 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"I have a good Australian Boomerang here. It's really strong and big but I don't think it could go against a sword, so all I could do is run and throw it directly into his leg when he least expects it, I could probably break his knee with this thing, then I could either keep running or , if he dropped his sword, avenge the Queen."

Frozen,39u4bf,StrawberryHitler,5,Sun Jun 14 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"These comics are created by the Constable, an energy field created by all fans of Frozen. The Constable surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the fandom together. Those blessed with the power of the Constable can manipulate it, bringing forth great fanart. It is a dual-sided process; the Constable controls your actions, but it also obeys your commands. But beware: although the Constable can be used for good, it can also be used for Elsanna. Once you start down that incestuous path, forever will it dominate your destiny."

Frozen,39rzpw,XNinja2017,6,Sun Jun 14 04:38:49 2015 UTC,"Cause generally humans are dangerous, give them something they don't understand. They will turn on it"
Frozen,39rzpw,dragongt1994,3,Sun Jun 14 04:46:12 2015 UTC,"Well, that's certainly true, and I anticipated this response. Yeah, this alone is evidenced by how everyone reacted at the coronation party with Elsa's revelation, and well human history as a whole. The thing that I find interesting though is how the royal family has ties with the Trolls' society implying that there is more to it than what we see in the film. Who knows for how long the two bodies have been negotiating, and for what purpose? Do the young Queen's powers tie into it? That's what intruiges me the most."
Frozen,39rzpw,Ep1cSpray,3,Sun Jun 14 04:55:40 2015 UTC,"Just deleted my comment on accident. Retyping >.< I think humans became more of a threat to the trolls over time. Naturally, the trolls responded to this by backing out of the lives of humans and staying in the Valley of the Living Rock. Many years pass and trolls are seen as fairy tale creatures that only exist in stories. I think the royal family knew different, though. They would have the most well documented history of the land, so they would know that the trolls really existed, even if the trolls stayed away. This is evidenced by Agnarr's reaction to go searching for the map to the Valley. He definitely knows that they exist.  Going back to my point about humans being a threat: we can tell that most people have a fear of magic. Elsa is taught to conceal her powers from the world. The trolls do the same. My theory is that as religion became more commonplace, people were less likely to accept any kind of magic. It could be seen as an affront to their beliefs; either contradicting them or seen as some sort of evil. It's very easy for people to jump to those sorts of conclusions, all you have to do is look at the Salem witch trials. People were executed there, and there wasn't even any proof of magic powers or anything of the sort (Yes, I do realize that some people just used it to extort stuff from the 'witches'). But there is a very real fear of anything unnatural. I don't believe the dukes reaction (although exaggerated) was too far from the ordinary (okay yes it was very exaggerated, but there's still some fear there). Remember the woman who pulls her baby tighter to herself after Elsa freezes the fountain? She was definitely afraid of Elsa. The people don't accept her, really, until the very end. The trolls are distancing themselves from the society of Arendelle because they believe that people would not readily accept them.   The people of Arendelle aren't, for the most part, afraid of Elsa or her powers. After the coronation incident she seems to have made things better. I think we will start to see some of the trolls come back to Arendelle in Frozen 2, after they see how accepting the people are of Elsa."

Frozen,39rzpw,Ep1cSpray,3,Sun Jun 14 05:50:31 2015 UTC,"Oh well, not like it was too difficult to type. Seems like a neat plugin though, I'll take a look at it."
Frozen,39rzpw,Demian_Dillers,3,Sun Jun 14 05:53:23 2015 UTC,"We also need to remember the kind of knowledge that the Trolls may possess. That kind of exotic knowledge would make them quite attractive for exploitation, which is why I think early settlers may have entered into some sort of conflict with them. This could explain their low numbers because they could have had something that was of great value to those settlers. I think the Trolls and the humans may have reached some compromise in the end, and that's how the Kingdom of Arendelle came to be.  Yeah, they do, as I stated with the example of Elsa's revelation. If humans did forget about the Trolls' presence aside from the royal family, then they could see magic as a potential threat. Humans tend to react violently to the unknown. I think it would induce further fear within the masses with the idea that the royal family knew about the Trolls all along, and such secrets could end up throwing all of Arendelle into chaos.  Well, not anymore at least. They certainly warmed up to her after that though. Still, it's true that the Trolls don't really have any reason to interfere in Arendelle's affairs. I think there will be a conflict either in the next installment or any future material that may force the Trolls to intervene though."
Frozen,39rzpw,Demian_Dillers,3,Sun Jun 14 06:14:55 2015 UTC,"I just think it's their nature, they are like us and animals, everyone has their habitat. They are just different creatures, they like to live among mushrooms, fungus, nature itself. They don't need to mix with humanity because they are just different, they wouldn't live on the city, nor the humans would live there and they don't need to trade or anything.   What do you think is their general opinion on Humanity?   Well, they don't seem to dislike, and they seem to keep a good relationship with the royal family, they don't seem to find them overly important (they suggested Kristoff killed Hans?) but they can find them cute and love them.   They raised a human, and do you think that Kristoff could act as a sort of negotiator and bridge the gap between the Trolls' society and Humanity in the future?   I don't think Kristoff would need to act as a negotiator between them and humanity, there's no need for them to mix, and it could be just annoying. But he could act as a mediator between them and Elsa, providing she doesn't feel so good about them after they traumatized her. That could be a good plot point to explore their friendship in a more meaningful way actually.   Clearly, the Trolls played an important role in Frozen, but they are still highly under-developed. What sort of role do you think they could take in the sequel if they return?   Marrying Anna and Kristoff, giving the guys life advice.   The fact that the King and Queen consulted the Trolls for advice suggests that their influence within the royal family may be more profound than at first glance. How long do you think they have intervened in the affairs of the royal family? And do you think these interventions may have shaped Arendelle in some form to it's present state? Possibly even being the reason for the ""curse""?   When Humans starting populating, they probably made a deal with he trolls to let them have their space, and helped them with some stuff, thus the trolls maintained a good relationship with the Royalty since then. They respect the King so humans, the human kingdom under the direction of Elsa's ancesters might have saved them once.   Over all I don't think there's so much of a big backstory about them, but they could have an important (but not big) role giving they have magic and know about magic creatures, also as Kristoff's family."
Frozen,39rzpw,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jun 14 05:27:37 2015 UTC,"Finally, a comprehensive response, and these are some nice points you raise here. Well, let's begin:   I just think it's their nature, they are like us and animals, everyone has their habitat. They are just different creatures, they like to live among mushrooms, fungus, nature itself. They don't need to mix with humanity because they are just different, they wouldn't live on the city, nor the humans would live there and they don't need to trade or anything.   Indeed, that's true, but I have wondered about their past. I do agree about that their reluctance to interact with human society in present day Arendelle may be attributed to their ecological preferences. They probably don't find the culture appealing in any way, therefore giving them no reason to interfere. It's likely that they were the dominant species until the first human explorers arrived on the mainland though, and that's where I feel like there could be more to this than meets the eye. Perhaps they entered some form of conflict with Humanity back then? Or maybe they were more prevalent in their population, but humans hunted them to near-extinction for some commodity. The Trolls seem to possess some exotic knowledge after all.   Well, they don't seem to dislike, and they seem to keep a good relationship with the royal family, they don't seem to find them overly important (they suggested Kristoff killed Hans?) but they can find them cute and love them.   True. Grand Pabbie didn't really seem all surprised when they brought Anna to him to cure her ailment. However, what I find interesting though is how the parents said ""Elsa, not again"" (Or something like that :p) meaning that they may have done this before with Elsa. Also, it's the royal family, out of everyone it's the freakin royal family. That alone makes the Trolls pretty influential in the affairs of Arendelle. I think they may have had a deeper role in the past.   I don't think Kristoff would need to act as a negotiator between them and humanity, there's no need for them to mix, and it could be just annoying. But he could act as a mediator between them and Elsa, providing she doesn't feel so good about them after they traumatized her.   Again true. One of my previous responses addresses this matter. People could start trying to exploit their exotic abilities further worsening the bond between both species in the long run. I think they could help Elsa with her powers in the future though.   Marrying Anna and Kristoff, giving the guys life advice.   Lol, I don't know what to add here. Yeah, they seem to be good with that sort of thing as evidenced by Fixer Upper. They still shouldn't marry though IMO.   When Humans starting populating, they probably made a deal with he trolls to let them have their space, and helped them with some stuff, thus the trolls maintained a good relationship with the Royalty since then. They respect the King so humans    A compromise could have been established between the early settlers and Trolls yes, but what if we take the RL indigenous people at the time into consideration? Would things change? I wonder what sorts of things they helped the royal families with though. It would be nice to get some further information on Elsa's powers though to further support these speculations.   Over all I don't think there's so much of a big backstory about them, but they could have an important (but not big) role giving they have magic and know about magic creatures, also as Kristoff's family.   This is why I don't think they should be discarded and left out of the sequel. The Trolls and Kristoff compliment each other. Build upon one and you inevitably build upon the other. It opens a lot of new possibilities."

Frozen,39rkzu,potato-table,2,Sun Jun 14 04:06:16 2015 UTC,"I guess that works, but I feel like Elsa should be dominant in any ship, so I don't like removing the ""E"" from Elsa."

Frozen,39q7ve,TheHappyJammer,3,Sat Jun 13 18:12:23 2015 UTC,Hans you evil bastard :(. This would make an excellent Anti-Hans propaganda poster xD. Just add some text and voila!
Frozen,39q7ve,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jun 13 18:41:52 2015 UTC,If anything it is a pro Hans poster!
Frozen,39q7ve,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jun 13 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"How? He is hurting the children, let alone Queen Elsa's child. It can be interpreted as an act of war xD."
Frozen,39q7ve,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jun 13 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, such an intolerable Queen! Again using emotions to run policy. Not a good idea!"
Frozen,39q7ve,dragongt1994,3,Sat Jun 13 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Well, entering the other guys kingdom just to harass their child isn't necessarily the most kind thing to do lol. If Hans' little scheme in Arendelle didn't demolish his reputation within the political setting enough, then this is the nail in the coffin here."
Frozen,39q7ve,Chris857,3,Sat Jun 13 19:14:51 2015 UTC,is this a zootopia reference?
Frozen,39pdc3,damocles2501,2,Sat Jun 13 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"Should probably be 'Past, past and now'... :p"
Frozen,39pdc3,Theroonco,3,Sat Jun 13 13:23:56 2015 UTC,Unless this is set in Coronation Elsa's time :)
Frozen,39pdc3,BartyMae,2,Sat Jun 13 15:38:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting to show the past as being a sort of shadow of the future: to signify that though it wasn't as great as what's to come, it was still a better time than the even shadowier present, and so it was sort of an in between the two? Also interesting that though the present has her head, she's still smiling. I love her hair style and clothing and poses pre-Let It Go, but she's not drawn very much that way...and when she is, she almost always looks unhappy in one way or another (understandably so, I know...but still)...and so I can't help but love this."
Frozen,39pdc3,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jun 13 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like when she's shown happy on her coronation outfit, I really don't think she was always sad, I'm sure she had happy moments and whatnot on her quieter days, it was mostly those stressful stuff that brought her down, after all she seemed pretty okay at the coronation party."
Frozen,39pdc3,BartyMae,2,Sat Jun 13 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"I agree: Coronation Day was supposed to be her worst nightmare, but she still managed to find some happiness in it here and there: as worn down and broken as she was, she still clearly had some capacity for enjoying things. I am sure the years after the Queen and King died were not exactly joy-filled, but...she had to have some things to fill her time that she liked...it would not be possible to go on like she did if there wasn't, IMO. We may have no idea what those things were, but that's not important. :P"
Frozen,39pdc3,Demian_Dillers,2,Sun Jun 14 09:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even if she was able to live completely on depression, she would've been completely fucked up if all her life was grim and dark. I imagine Elsa enjoyed things like chocolate, reading and being creative in general. My headcanon is that she day dreamed a lot imagining stuff, which is why she made the castle and everything so easily and fast. Would be cool to see her enjoying more of those things again in the sequel, hopefully we'll know more of her world, if not hopefully on a book kind of like ""A Frozen heart"" is for Anna and Hans."
Frozen,39pdc3,BartyMae,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a book would probably be the best place for showing stuff that is closer to ""every day"" Elsa - whether it takes place before or after the events of Frozen (actually, seeing both might be cool). Movie screen time is so limited, it's difficult to show the ""normal"" side of people in a non-superficial way, haha."
Frozen,39pdc3,Demian_Dillers,2,Mon Jun 15 01:40:53 2015 UTC,"Haha well it is more limited indeed, although we still could have a nice scope, a book certainly would help us expand it a lot. If it's like a Frozen Heart it would be a retelling of the movie on Elsa's eyes (And Kritoff's I guess since AFH is about Anna and Hans) so we could know a lot about how she felt and what she did those years, also her relationship with her parents, hopefully it will happen."
Frozen,39pdc3,XNinja2017,2,Mon Jun 15 04:15:28 2015 UTC,I like these kinds of fanart. Truly gives you a glimpse of how much her character changed over time. Her life story compressed into the form of a single image.

Frozen,39oxmh,scribe22557786,5,Sat Jun 13 10:03:47 2015 UTC,Marshmellow was just a manifestation of what she was experiencing at the time. It being the desire for Anna to leave.
Frozen,39oxmh,XNinja2017,3,Sat Jun 13 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yup Marshy is her only planned child, her emotions represent what she wants to create, at the moment she needed a good guard someone who would protect her from all the wrath and problems that were coming, sadly Marshy failed, well, good thing he did or Anna would've ended up Frozen."
Frozen,39oxmh,Demian_Dillers,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:01:32 2015 UTC,I'll argue that Marsh was created just as spur-of-the-moment without much conscious thought as Olaf was.
Frozen,39oxmh,Portgas,3,Sat Jun 13 10:16:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it was the only time she said to herself, ""I'm going to create a living snow being"". Olaf wasn't supposed to be alive, and the snowgies weren't supposed to exist at all."
Frozen,39oxmh,Portgas,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:16:45 2015 UTC,"but it was the only time she said to herself, ""I'm going to create a living snow being   Yeah, no. She just made a basic fast pass with her hands and created a giant snowman. She looked surprised herself . And it looks like anything she does that has two hands and two legs is living, even her sneezes, so that hardly counts."
Frozen,39oxmh,Portgas,3,Sat Jun 13 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"Jennifer Lee has said that when Elsa made Marshmallow, she did so knowing what he'd be and that he'd be alive:   Jennifer: Yeah. And we had to reverse into how Marshmallow would fit and why Elsa would make him. ...    Jennifer: And Olaf was a bit of an anchor with that. She’s like, if I can make that, I can make this.   (emphasis mine)  She didn't know Olaf would be alive when she made him, and she didn't know she was making snowgies at all. I don't know what the end point of this is, if there is an end point. It's just an observation."
Frozen,39oxmh,Demian_Dillers,2,Sat Jun 13 15:23:12 2015 UTC,Then I don't know why Elsa created such a big scary beast just to shoo Anna away.
Frozen,39oxmh,Portgas,2,Sat Jun 13 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty obvious in the movie she created him intentionally after realizing she could create life with Olaf, the scenes had the right foreshadowing. She probably realized that Anna wasn't the only one that was gonna get to the castle. Also Anna kept going back to her door when they were younger, that girl is persistent, perhaps Elsa realized it was time to make extreme measures and was also angry at Anna for going over and kind of ruining her day and keep fighting her, even if she knew it wasn't her fault. She thought that Anna wouldn't go back if she was scared and wouldn't try to fight that thing. She was almost correct."

Frozen,39lmiw,ArendelleKnight,9,Fri Jun 12 16:25:33 2015 UTC,I'd be like those Tinker Bell movies. I've heard they are actually pretty decent. F2 would probably be 60-70 minute long with some licensed songs and few originals. The plot would revolve around some unimportant mcguffin and the story will revolve around Anna/Elsa's parents.
Frozen,39lmiw,Portgas,2,Fri Jun 12 16:31:12 2015 UTC,Some back story retcon about Anna and Elsa's parents or them returning to Arendelle alive?
Frozen,39lmiw,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 12 18:08:10 2015 UTC,Probably. That'd be so bad that it'd almost be good.
Frozen,39lmiw,dcb720,2,Fri Jun 12 18:09:03 2015 UTC,It might be entertaining enough if I could just think of it as glorified fanfiction.

Frozen,39lmiw,Demian_Dillers,4,Sat Jun 13 02:41:16 2015 UTC,":,( Such a nightmarish hypothetical scenario.      Would it be a thinly veiled remake of Frozen 1 with Anna and Kristoff's kids?   Nah, they haven't gone that cheap and I doubt they would do that on this era, the setting itself wouldn't allow it unless they said Elsa died early.   Would they retcon some major plot point of Frozen 1?   I don't think there's much to retcon, unless they went evil trolls theory or added that during some years Anna and Elsa did interact with other people and had some ""special"" friends. Most likely they would put that on Elsa with a childhood friend who understood her when she was isolated, he would return as her love interest. Pretty much the same as Brother Bear 2.  Speaking of which, BB is another Disney franchise based on Brotherhood, we could draw some Disney Toons possibilities from there even if BB didn't have a tenth of the impact Frozen had on the world.   Would Anna get fire powers?   This is actually a possibility, a terrible one at that but...ugh.   Would Sven get his own song?   If the craziness of the internet is to be believed. He will get one regardless during Frozen 2, when it's revealed he has always been Kristoff's older brother cursed and transformed at young age and returns to a human form to be Elsa's Love Interest. (A mix of terrible ideas/theories I've read about Frozen 2)."
Frozen,39lmiw,Demian_Dillers,2,Fri Jun 12 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, they haven't gone that cheap and I doubt they would do that on this era   They did with Little Mermaid 2, and they would in the era I'm talking about...

If Frozen was made during the Disney Renaissance and the sequel was passed off to Disney Toons around that time I could see it.   the setting itself wouldn't allow it unless they said Elsa died early.   Or she abdicated.  It doesn't have to be exact to be a thinly veiled remake, the main thing is that the elder child, who of course has ice magic (or maybe some other elemental magic to mix things up a bit) loses control and runs away and the younger goes after them.

I could see either of those happening.  In the latter case I could even see Elsa's childhood friend being a thinly veiled Jack Frost clone, cause whoever Disney Toon Studios got to direct Frozen 2 spent like 10 seconds on the internet researching the Frozen fandom and came away thinking that Jelsa was a widely popular ship. :P   Speaking of which, BB is another Disney franchise based on Brotherhood, we could draw some Disney Toons possibilities from there even if BB didn't have a tenth of the impact Frozen had on the world.   I haven't seen either Brother Bear movie, so I've got nothing to add here.   This is actually a possibility, a terrible one at that but...ugh.   Strangely enough I could actually see the logic here.  Pabbie removed all magic, even memories of magic, so they could say that she had fire magic from birth but it was taken away along with her memories, then restored when her memories were restored.  Since she suddenly had fire magic again it might even be fully developed as if it had been growing her whole life like Elsa's magic, making it harder for her to control.

I think I would have liked it the same. I'd be really interested to see the whole movie in 2D.   I see. I don't know, one of the things I loved in Frozen were the stunning visuals that at times mimicked reality blending it with he  toon style.

They could also use more elements of the Snow Queen and have a ""shard"" still stuck there and Anna starts losing her love, perhaps that's why Kristanna doesn't advance (although they believe it's because Anna is still traumatized by Hans), in the end Elsa must do a true love act for Anna in order for all her magic to completely disappear and let Anna ""feel"" again. Thus putting them both at a important spotlight, the problem wouldn't be a villain but once again the feelings and whatnot, a villain could just be  a vehicle like Hans was and Kristoff could be tangled there too.   Anna or Elsa dying is the other big one.   How about other chars? Kristoff, Olaf, Sven or maybe a Redeeming Hans dying saving one of them (he just redeems for a while right before that, not the whole movie).   I'm sure I'll get to it soon.

The basic concept sounds like it could work, but I see two problems.  First of all if there's a shard still stuck in her heart why did her hair all change back to it's natural color when she thawed?  Shouldn't the white streak still be there, maybe even begin spreading albeit at a slower rate than when she was freezing to death?  Secondly why would the effects of that shard in her heart take over a year to manifest?   How about other chars? Kristoff, Olaf, Sven or maybe a Redeeming Hans dying saving one of them (he just redeems for a while right before that, not the whole movie).

Frozen,39hj5v,OtomeOtome,3,Fri Jun 12 17:51:29 2015 UTC,This would have been way better if Eugene was replaced with Rapunzel.
Frozen,39hj5v,OtomeOtome,3,Fri Jun 12 04:39:48 2015 UTC,And even better if Constable found some way to stick Marisol in there.
Frozen,39j4z0,Demian_Dillers,4,Fri Jun 12 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Given the 11 month time skip between Frozen and Frozen Fever (and assuming Frozen 2 doesn't take place between Frozen and Frozen Fever) a wedding or at least an engagement could be possible.  If not in Frozen 2 I do think they'll be married by the end of 3.  A Kristanna wedding could be a good way to end the first trilogy.    What are your thoughts and hopes on this?    I want to see their relationship develop further, but I don't have anything to go on really since I don't know how much of a time skip there is between Frozen Fever and Frozen 2, or anything about the plot of Frozen 2.    Should they keep the same dynamic as in fever with Elsa on their lives and all kind of a family, at to not make it too much about the couple?    Yeah.  I do want to see more Kristanna and Ice Bros, but I still want the main focus to be on the sisters.    Should they get children on Frozen 2 or the speculative 3?    Definitely not.  That's second trilogy material if anything.  At least then if it ends up being a Disney Toon Studios style remake of Frozen 1 with Anna and Kristoff's kids playing the roles of Anna and Elsa we'll still have the one good trilogy. :P    Should there be an act of true love between them?    Depends on the context/specifics I guess.      Should Kristoff have other merits aside from Anna?    Sure.    Should Anna be able to hold herself as a character outside of her relationships?    That's already the case."
Frozen,39j4z0,ArendelleKnight,4,Fri Jun 12 03:14:44 2015 UTC,A Kristanna wedding could be a good way to end the first trilogy.   Not sure that should be the big ending though :P.

Frozen,39j4z0,ArendelleKnight,3,Fri Jun 12 03:38:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure that should be the big ending though :P.

Or in the middle of the movie as a soft climax , or perhaps a more intense moment rather than a completely planned one.   Sorry about that.  At least we know Frozen 2 isn't being passed off to Disney Toon Studios.   /hug.  Yeah, AFAIR there's actually a policy that they won't do that anymore and Disney Toons will develop their own stuff (like Planes) while WDAS will not do sequels unless it's an special case. So we should expect more quality work for the third part!.   Seriously though, if they do have children, even Elsa (cringe!) . I hope none ever has powers."

I don't know, that might be changing.  I'm sure there will be a Frozen 3, and I'll be pretty surprised if we don't get at least one more Big Hero 6 movie at some point.  It's a superhero movie, and the first one was the origin story, it's almost a given.   So we should expect more quality work for the third part!   I think they can pull off a good trilogy.   Seriously though, if they do have children, even Elsa (cringe!) . I hope none ever has powers.   I actually wouldn't be completely opposed to that.  I mean it makes sense that her powers could be passed on to her children, or to Anna's children.

Besides they wouldn't dare to risk a property like Frozen like that. Luckily we are out of the 90's.   I don't know, that might be changing. I'm sure there will be a Frozen 3, and I'll be pretty surprised if we don't get at least one more Big Hero 6 movie at some point. It's a superhero movie, and the first one was the origin story, it's almost a given.   WiR is also getting a sequel. I agree with making Frozen a trilogy, seems a no brainer. Who knows about BH6 I'd expect a sequel from the ending and all, but that would be dependent on many factors I suppose, the most important one if they must prioritize other projects.   I think they can pull off a good trilogy.   I do too, but in any case, we will assert if we really want one after Frozen 2. The fandom will be scary! :P.   I actually wouldn't be completely opposed to that. I mean it makes sense that her powers could be passed on to her children, or to Anna's children.   Only if you're using OUAT's logic :P. IDK I don't think Elsa's gift/curse should survive more, nor that the story of another ice mage should be repeated at all. And Elsa shouldn't have children, she's pretty terrible with the ones she has already :P.   My problem would be if there was a time skip and the focus shifted to the kids, especially if as I said before it was a thinly veiled remake of Frozen 1 with the kids playing the roles of Anna and Elsa.   Ew . I'm confident they wouldn't go that far, Disney is cheesy at times (which seems to be decreasing), but never  get to that level. I'm sure they won't repeat the mistakes of LM2."
Frozen,39j4z0,Ep1cSpray,5,Fri Jun 12 05:35:14 2015 UTC,"Kristanna should be  developed, would be the easiest to develop the two characters. Having it just about elsa and anna would be boring. However Kristanna should support the elsa and anna relationship  development"
Frozen,39j4z0,XNinja2017,2,Fri Jun 12 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"Kristanna should be developed, would be the easiest to develop the two characters.   I agree it should, and yeah sadly it's kind of too convenient to just use that, so hope they actually give them more than their romance.   Having it just about elsa and anna would be boring.   Totally agree. It's the main theme of the franchise, but there's much more potential to Frozen than just limiting it to that. I do agree that Kristanna should be a vehicle to the main story though."
Frozen,39j4z0,XNinja2017,5,Fri Jun 12 04:17:31 2015 UTC,I don't think too much screen time should be devoted to it (definitely no more than Frozen 1 had for them) but I'd love to see them get engaged or married!
Frozen,39j4z0,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 12 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think that Kristanna will progress as far as an engagement, and stop there. My guess is that in Frozen 2 something will happen with the trolls causing Kristoff to delay their marriage in order to fix the problem."
Frozen,39j4z0,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 12 04:51:18 2015 UTC,"I think that Kristanna will progress as far as an engagement, and stop there.   Imagine if he died right before the wedding, sacrificing himself to save Elsa for extra feel effects."
Frozen,39j4z0,HeimrArnadalr,5,Fri Jun 12 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah...  Before I say anything else, I don't think they should ever marry. It's just completely unnecessary and Fever showed no improvement whatsoever regarding their relationship status. I don't think we will see much even after another whole year which is likely the amount of time that will have elapsed since the first film, or whenever the hell Frozen II takes place. Well anyways, here we go:   I personally don't care since I don't ship, but this depends entirely on how much time has passed since the first film. Fever took place one year after Frozen and there wasn't really any improvement between their relationship. I would expect there to be some development, but not much really. It would be more of a side thing really rather then it being incorporated into the main plot. At most, we could expect a few bits of dialogue and that's it really. Yeah, rather than focusing entirely on the Kristanna ship, it should focus more on the main theme of the franchise (so far at least) being familial love. Besides, the movie never revolved around the ship. Attempting to cater to the fans of this ship by increasing its prominence in the film could end up hurting the franchise in the future because it would deviate from the central themes of the franchise being familial love and self-acceptance. No. Not much else. It's completely redundant and it would hurt the franchise more than help it IMO. Like I said, it's better to keep it as a side thing rather then trying to shove it into the main plot. I don't understand this question. Elaborate please. She already proved her capability to act upon her own judgment in Frozen. It would be still be interesting to expand upon this aspect further though."

I totally agree on this!, they should not make romance the focus of the sequel since it's not what really made the franchise big. They could use it as a vehicle to further expand the point like Hans and Anna, but certainly telling a ""love story"" wouldn't be good.   I don't understand this question. Elaborate please.   Basically if he should do more as a character himself or be limited by Kristanna and his role as the protagonist Love Interest."
Frozen,39j4z0,Portgas,3,Fri Jun 12 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Romance was never the central theme of Frozen, nor the idea that propelled it to it's current state of glory. Giving the ship a more prominent role in the sequel will make it feel like fanservice to be honest. Doesn't mean it should be disregarded entirely because I would still be nice to get some small insight as to how their relationship has developed over the last [Insert Arbitrary Number] years here since the last film via short dialogue between some of the characters.   Basically if he should do more as a character himself or be limited by Kristanna and his role as the protagonist Love Interest.   Thank you. Sorry, I am just don't feel good right now (been depriving myself of sleep lately). Yes, he should. Kristoff has a lot of potential for development as was discussed on that other thread concerning his development in Frozen II."
Frozen,39j4z0,Drewshoo,2,Fri Jun 12 04:00:04 2015 UTC,"Well they could have some moments kissing and doing stuff like a picnic and making Elsa uncomfortable, but definitely shouldn't be the main focus or the sole or main reason for the chars to advance, they do need to include Elsa on their lives after all and of course, deal with the problematic, that should be bigger than them. In the end Anna learning more about herself and her skills (since Kristoff is a mountaineer and Elsa a magician) could be cool."
Frozen,39j4z0,Animal31,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:52:00 2015 UTC,"was never the central theme of Frozen   But, it was. The movie spends as much effort and time on that theme as on any other."

Frozen,39grro,creepycherry,3,Thu Jun 11 16:46:24 2015 UTC,It would have been cool/sad if they used the position she was frozen in trying to stop Hans from killing Elsa.
Frozen,39grro,barbedcatpenis,2,Thu Jun 11 19:16:48 2015 UTC,I think the Elsa topiary looks better.  The expression on Anna's face just doesn't look right to me.

Frozen,39gfyw,multihalbun,3,Thu Jun 11 15:36:20 2015 UTC,When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow oooh.
Frozen,39gfyw,Portgas,2,Thu Jun 11 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it's a more substantial game than a mobile connect-3. I'd expect it to be, if it's coming to consoles and PC."

Frozen,39f293,Theroonco,2,Thu Jun 11 08:04:19 2015 UTC,Posted it yesterday :P
Frozen,39f293,Portgas,2,Thu Jun 11 08:48:21 2015 UTC,I thought this seemed familiar... :/
Frozen,39f25k,Theroonco,2,Thu Jun 11 08:03:07 2015 UTC,Sorry. Spam filter. Usual stuff. Just fixed right now.
Frozen,39ckd3,twinkle122,4,Wed Jun 10 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Really cool, never saw this kind of hat design before. Nice work."
Frozen,39ckd3,Portgas,2,Wed Jun 10 21:29:13 2015 UTC,I didn't even know the popup mouth and tooth was possible. Very well done.
Frozen,39ckd3,greenlamb,2,Thu Jun 11 05:35:30 2015 UTC,aw thanks guys :)
Frozen,39ckd3,vinjhup,3,Thu Jun 11 05:41:49 2015 UTC,The eyes scare me. I mean the rest of it looks amazing but those eyes scare me.
Frozen,39ckd3,Bazrum,2,Thu Jun 11 00:42:53 2015 UTC,haha the eyes scare me a little too- I think it's the pupils... they should have been slightly larger. :)
Frozen,39ckd3,Bazrum,2,Thu Jun 11 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"i like the hat, its really cool.  but those eyes make it look like he's either under massive stress or in withdrawal from hardcore drugs or something."
Frozen,39ckd3,LastUniqueUserID,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:47:32 2015 UTC,Lol or he's just really excited about summer? 😉
Frozen,39ckd3,pumpkinrum,2,Thu Jun 11 11:13:09 2015 UTC,Let's go with yours
Frozen,39d4bi,ArendelleKnight,3,Wed Jun 10 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"You know, I have always imagined Elsa as a fan of racing. It's just that her status as Queen prevents her from ever engaging in such an activity."

Frozen,39cjm5,ArendelleKnight,3,Wed Jun 10 21:11:29 2015 UTC,I...  I actually can't believe this wasn't a thing sooner. Wow...
Frozen,39cjm5,Theroonco,3,Wed Jun 10 21:39:49 2015 UTC,Lol.
Frozen,39cjm5,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jun 10 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Uh, this might be a little daft, but what is that thing on the front of the bike supposed to be for the last image? It kind of reminds me of the Dead Hand monster from Ocarina of Time (that currently looks a little miniature, lol), but I am pretty sure that's not what it's supposed to be...haha."
Frozen,39cjm5,BartyMae,4,Wed Jun 10 21:25:28 2015 UTC,It's a reference to the Steven Spielberg movie classic E.T. -- hence the title E.A.  it's a pretty iconic image
Frozen,39cjm5,damocles2501,2,Wed Jun 10 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, doh: I did realize it was a reference to E.T., but I didn't think to actually look at the original and compare, haha. Still looks a little ghoul-y to me...:P"
Frozen,39cjm5,BartyMae,3,Wed Jun 10 21:46:09 2015 UTC,Basic supplies as in the original film (but it's been a long time since I've seen it)? I know the boy has a torch at least.
Frozen,39cjm5,Theroonco,3,Wed Jun 10 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know how long you've been here since I have never seen you before :p, but let me introduce you to the enigma known as ""Constable"".  ""Constable"" is a sublime ascended entity who possesses a ubiquitious presence on /r/Frozen. Many have tried to peer into the mind of this entity and define what ""Constable"" really is. However, trying to understand a concept that has transcended beyond the boundaries of what we perceive as art has led to many disappointing inconclusive endeavors in the end. What people here don't realize is that ""Constable"" isn't a single being, but rather a phenomena, a concept, a very aspect of existence itself. ""Constable"" is the very embodiment of what we all aspire to become when we transcend into the afterlife. We are all sub-consciously his disciples, but it's impossible to ever attain the exact state of mind that ""Constable"" has achieved.  I can only tell you this comrade. Don't bother trying to understand ""Constable"". It can induce madness even in the minds of the most sane men."
Frozen,39cjm5,XNinja2017,3,Wed Jun 10 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am definitely newer: first post here was a tiny bit over three weeks ago.  What's there to understand? Constable is brilliant: anyone can see that."
Frozen,39cjm5,BartyMae,3,Wed Jun 10 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"Kinda late since I know we have discussed before, but welcome! And please leave your sanity at the door xD.  Well, my post was never meant to be taken seriously lol. I just like to pass off Constable as some trans-dimensional being who encompasses all reality because of boredom. Yeah, his work is quite famous among the users of this sub because of it's trademark weirdness lol.  But seriously, welcome comrade, and I hope you enjoy your stay here :)."
Frozen,39cjm5,XNinja2017,2,Wed Jun 10 23:17:33 2015 UTC,Pedal! Anna you little shit.
Frozen,39cjm5,Demian_Dillers,2,Thu Jun 11 00:04:51 2015 UTC,I was looking for a gaming reference for a minute. Still clever.

Frozen,39e724,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jun 11 03:40:46 2015 UTC,This is the version of Elsa she decided to use for her cosplay after a making a vote.
Frozen,39e724,PepsiPerfect,2,Thu Jun 11 03:41:45 2015 UTC,Do you know if there is a higher resolution version of this?
Frozen,39e724,XNinja2017,3,Thu Jun 11 04:01:24 2015 UTC,Edited the link with the full version.
Frozen,39du6q,Demian_Dillers,3,Thu Jun 11 02:18:41 2015 UTC,Pretty nice. Why the downvotes? The hell?
Frozen,39du6q,XNinja2017,3,Thu Jun 11 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"Haters gonna hate. Seriously this doesn't even make sense to being downvoted xD, but whatever."
Frozen,39du6q,XNinja2017,3,Thu Jun 11 04:22:45 2015 UTC,I think it was just trolls dude. You were not alone here. I noticed it here with a few other posts.
