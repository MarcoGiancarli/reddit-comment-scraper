WomensSoccer,3dxokx,noheadband,9,Mon Jul 20 11:44:28 2015 UTC,They're playing in their respective leagues. The PanAm games are also not as important as the world cup so younger/fringe players are used instead.
WomensSoccer,3dxokx,eninc,3,Mon Jul 20 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"With the soccer for the women having no age restrictions, I would imagine you might see some USWNT players there  though probably younger players. However, I have never followed the Pan-Am games in the past so I cannot say for certain.   Of course that being said, the reason is basically in your post: it's so close to the WWC. The players were on press events, and are just now returning to the NWSL where they have club commitments.  If you want to see the USWNT players you saw in the WWC, there will be a 10-city celebration tour which kicks off in Pittsburgh on the 16th of August. Stayed tuned and you'll be able to watch them play again."
WomensSoccer,3dxokx,JBeContact,3,Mon Jul 20 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"Fatique, injuries, club commitments, endorsement/press obligations, Pan-Am games aren't as big a deal, and new player development are a few reasons that come to mind."

WomensSoccer,3dyaq6,sanbikinoraion,3,Mon Jul 20 15:01:39 2015 UTC,Can you explain the difference between the Continental Cup and the FA Women's Cup?  I'm kinda confused about why we already know who's playing in the FA Cup before the table is set.
WomensSoccer,3dyaq6,Mall0ryMarie,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Sure!  The FA Cup is the cup competition for entire FA pyramid of 9 tiers. Most of those leagues follow the traditional winter calendar of (roughly) Sep - May, but the new FAWSL, which forms the top 2 tiers play in the summer, April - Sep.  So for the 2014-15 season FA Cup, the knockout games started in Sep 2014, with the WSL2 teams entering in Feb '15 and WSL1 in Mar '15, culminating in the final on Aug 1st.  Whereas the Continental Tyres Cup is the league cup for the WSL. When there was a single WSL tier, it was a simple knockout competition (later 2 groups of 4), but with the addition of WSL2, the cup has expanded to a international tournament-style group stage followed by knockouts. The cup is now contested solely by the 18 teams in WSL1 and 2, and the groups are dictated roughly regionally in such a way to split the WSL1 teams fairly evenly between them."
WomensSoccer,3dyaq6,Mall0ryMarie,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:14 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Is the prize for finishing at the top of the table mainly entry into the UEFA Women's Champions League then?

WomensSoccer,3dm2wk,voteforsummer,2,Fri Jul 17 11:07:45 2015 UTC,"This unexpected absence is disappointing to see as Mr. Gulati was present on the medal podium in Vancouver last Sunday gleefully handing out medals to the USWNT World Cup Winners.  He made statements to the press at the beginning of the Women's World Cup explaining that U.S. Soccer had no involvement with the issues for which indictments had been brought against FIFA officials in Switzerland, and yet today excuses himself from Congressional hearings claiming that his personal lawyer has advised him to remain mum. This doesn't bode well for any future hearings if he's ever subpoenaed.  Worse yet, CONCACAF's current president Jeffrey Webb has been extradited to the U.S. as of yesterday, and it's almost certain that a plea bargain is in the works. Much dirty laundry that winds up tainting Gulati and U.S. Soccer could be aired if that happens.  Given that both recent Copa America's and CONCACAF Gold Cups are coming under scrutiny, I would not be surprised to learn that recent Women's World Cups are also due for a closer look."

WomensSoccer,3dirvi,neclov,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:18 2015 UTC,That was a really long article. Pretty good read though.
WomensSoccer,3dirvi,jayjaywalker3,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"Glad they stepped in to help with the whole ""artificial turf"" controversy. Oh wait..."
WomensSoccer,3dirvi,PrintStar,2,Fri Jul 17 02:32:21 2015 UTC,"Well, they said they stepped in too late. And as others have noted, the Canadian bid was on the basis of it being played on artificial turf -- and in the end, they were the only bidder. Hopefully for WWC2023 there will be enough bidders that the quality of the bids can actually be assessed. Looking at the list of potential bidders, I'd be excited for a holiday to any of them -- Japan, Australia, Thailand and New Zealand have all declared an interest, and none of those should have problems providing grass pitches.  Hmm, I can't decide where I'd like to go the most. Japan, probably, since it would be winter in Aus/NZ."
WomensSoccer,3dirvi,sanbikinoraion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:39:00 2015 UTC,"I was just being sarcastic about the turf.  I'm more suspicious concerning the union's true goals considering that the clubs and national teams aren't exactly ""profit centers"" that are exploiting female athletes.  Their pay is low, but many clubs don't make money even with the low wages.  It could probably help the high-profile national team players, though."
WomensSoccer,3dirvi,PrintStar,2,Fri Jul 17 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"It sounded to me like some of the FIFPro initial motive was self-serving regarding the turf, since they are already trying to stop the men's game from transitioning from grass. That doesn't mean female players still can't leverage the significantly larger resources of FIFPro to their advantage, even if FIFPro doesn't have nearly enough women in the boardroom. That said, the female players interviewed made it sound that FIFPro had ponied up the resources and talked a good game so far. It'll be interesting if this changes how FIFPro operates, having players of both genders in solidarity (less focused on enriching wealthy players in Europe, more focus on helping players in poor countries where the game is underfunded--especially for women)."

WomensSoccer,3dfa6x,HasheemThabeetGOAT,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"This might partly be true, but I feel like a big part of the reason is the lack of access to it.

In the run up to the men's World Cup you don't get shite articles about ""Which male hotties to look out for this tournament"".  And I read the article. It was pish.   You don't mention Hope Solo's capability on the field, you call her a psycho instead.   You don't talk about the capabilities of the English defence, instead you go off on a tangent about how they're poor going forward. No mention of Sesselmann's ability, and apparently Krieger's greatest skill is returning from injury.  Hoogendijk ""will be important"" - very in depth analysis. But hey she's hot, so who cares?  Henry is a rock, eh, a bit more of a compliment, doesn't really showcase any knowledge about her capability on the field though.  Goessling and Germany are a strong team? Hm interesting analysis.  And Marta is ""Neymar with breasts"". Honestly that sentence made me grimace.   On Alex Morgan - ""please just go to her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit photoshoot right now"" - because looking at pictures of her in a bikini is much more satisfying than watching her play football, amirite? At least you mentioned that she is ""insanely good at soccer"".   And finally, Wilkinson, and it appears her capability on the field consists of being ""a gem in a coal mine"". That sure does say a lot about her technical ability!  Then you go on to say that nobody gives a shit about Japan as a team. Nobody gives a shit about the then-defending World Champions, and 4th ranked team in the world? Or did you just not give a shit because you didn't find them attractive?"

WomensSoccer,3cn0x0,PrintStar,2,Thu Jul 9 10:30:25 2015 UTC,"No Allysha Chapman (Canada) in the defenders?  She was outstanding during this World Cup.  Zurrer is included, and I don't think she played at all this tourney (although she's awesome, don't get me wrong...).  No Laura Boulleau (France) in the defenders?  Again, outstanding performance.  Lisa Dahlkvist (Sweden) not listed in midfielders?  Maybe not exceptional this tourney, but I'm a huge fan and she's always a solid midfielder.  Definitely on my ""Dream Team.""  Manon Melis (Netherlands) needs to be added as a forward.  She's a huge part of that team's success.  You should add some goalies.  That'd be fun!  I think those are a few of my personal favorites that I couldn't find in the list.  I don't want to take the survey yet because I'd probably add all those I mentioned above."

Seemed like no one was dominant all tourney long - I mean, I defaulted to the injured Maroszan on the left.  The rest of my 23 would include a ton of Americans and Canadians, which is probably my favoritism coming out. I feel really strange about choosing no Japanese. Not even Naho."

WomensSoccer,3cnm0e,ACCBiggz,4,Thu Jul 9 08:29:31 2015 UTC,"United States  It would appear Jill Ellis will stick around through the next World Cup. I don't have an issue with that, but I also would mind a new coach. Not because Ellis is terrible or anything like that, but the USA has to usher in a new era. A new coach with a new roster would be the way to go.    Name Position Age Age+4    Abby Wambach F 35 39   Alex Morgan F 26 30   Ali Krieger D 30 34   Alyssa Naeher GK 27 31   Amy Rodriguez F 28 32   Ashlyn Harris GK 29 33   Becky Sauerbrunn D 30 34   Carli Lloyd M 32 36   Christen Press F 26 30   Christie Rampone D 40 44   Heather O'Reilly M 30 34   Hope Solo GK 33 37   Julie Johnston D 23 27   Kelley O'Hara M 26 30   Lauren Holiday M 27 31   Lori Chalupny D 31 35   Meghan Klingenberg D 26 30   Morgan Brian M 22 26   Shannon Boxx M 38 42   Sydney Leroux F 25 29   Tobin Heath M 27 31   Whitney Engen D 27 31   Megan Rapinoe M 30 34    I would try and compel Abby Wambach, Christie Rampone, and Hope Solo to lead a U-23 roster to the Olympics. It may be forgoing a chance to win gold, but this would be more beneficial to competing at the World Cup. Obviously, without the men's age limit in effect the U.S. could get away with adding Morgan Brian to the roster to as she would be 23 by the time of the Olympics. It's a decision I would go with. Wambach helping lead/teach the new young forwards, Solo/Rampone to help develop the up-and-coming backline, and Brian to get chemistry with everyone.  The timeline of how women's soccer works doesn't quite give them the time to go through normal rebuilding because the Olympics is almost on equal footing. It's World Cup-Olympics-Qualifying-World Cup. The U.S. needs to not worry about Rio.  Lloyd, from what I've heard, intends to try and make a 2019 run. Others will be on that cutting line by being in their mid-30s as well. One bright spot is that theoretically, the backline could be even stronger at 2019. Replacing Solo will be difficult, but Harris could step in.  Morgan Brian, Julie Johnston, Sydney Leroux would be the only sub-30 players on the 2019 roster at this point. Scary. This U.S. performance showed how much international experience is important, and there is no better time to get that experience than the Olympics.  There is a lot of room for competition by not sending the senior squad to the Olympics.  How should your country handle the roster (or your favorite non-U.S. country)? England showed promise, Canada will have to replace key pieces, Germany looks to rebound in a post-Neid era, etc."
WomensSoccer,3cnm0e,Breatheher,4,Thu Jul 9 08:58:43 2015 UTC,I want my nation to be allowed to take part in the Olympics by the other shitty UK FAs.

WomensSoccer,3cnm0e,PM_ME_WUTEVER,2,Thu Jul 9 11:05:46 2015 UTC,It won't happen. The other FAs are too scared about losing their independence within sport I believe. Reckon they should let us just submit an England team to represent Team GB tbh.
WomensSoccer,3cnm0e,yestanotherusername,3,Thu Jul 9 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"I want to see us go for gold in the Olympics. It's not as prestigious as the WC, but right now, I think it's still the second most prestigious honor in women's soccer--as opposed to league titles, the Champions League, continental tournaments, and maybe the Confederations Cup in the men's game. So while I definitely want to see the US do some tinkering and giving different players a shot, for me, winning is still the most important factor.  That being said, some changes will definitely need to be made. For one, I want to see more work on our formations and tactics. Reduce the longball even more. I'd like to stick with the 433, but considering our personnel--an abundance of strikers and lack of box-to-box/holding midfielders--the 442 that we played against China might be more suitable.  Between now and the Olympics, I want to see if Alex Morgan is our clear-cut best option up top. If she is, make her the full time starter in Rio and see how she does. She was our best striker in the WC, but we really need a world class finisher, and that may or may not be her. I wasn't that impressed with her play before the WC, and IIRC, before her injury, she had the most consecutive minutes without a goal out of all the strikers.  Whether she pairs with Morgan up top, plays the wing, or possibly #10, I'd like to see Ellis figure out a role for Christen Press. She's too good of a player to not be in our starting XI.  Especially with Holiday leaving, our midfield is going to need some work. Worst case scenario, we put Boxx in Holiday's spot and keep things the way they were, but considering Boxx is 38, that's a stopgap at best. That means we either have to go to a 442 or find someone to play next to Morgan Brian as I don't think Lloyd is suited for a deep-lying/holding role.  If we stick with the 433, who do we put next to Brian? I think Heath is way more suited for running at opponents and playing the final ball. Convert Engen, Chalupny, Buehler, or one of the many other back four options who didn't make the WC squad? Maybe we put JJ in midfield and Engen and Buehler at CB? That might not be a bad idea, considering how active JJ is. Regardless, I want to solidify one formation and figure out backups or pairings for Brian.  Furthermore, I think there's a very real possibility Brian is our best #10 option in 2019, which makes it even more important to find another holding midfielder. If I'm missing any viable options for holding midfield let me know as I'm sure there are people who follow the team more closely than me."
WomensSoccer,3cnm0e,putabirdonthings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"I would like to see the women's tournament move towards an age limit just to be able to see younger players. I could see the top teams (Germany, France, US, Japan) voluntarily instituting a <30 limit as a start. Plus 3 overage players. Going from the US WC roster, that would cut the players down to 12 plus 3 (say Solo, Broon and Lloyd). And then three spots would be open for Dunn, Huerta, etc."

WomensSoccer,3cklej,PM_ME_WUTEVER,2,Thu Jul 9 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"That was my thought process as well. The 1999 team won the 2000 ESPY for Best Team, so maybe they will add Lloyd next year, but at the same time, it'd be really weird if they went for Best Team this year and then went for individual awards next year.  Call me cynical, but either way, I'm pretty sure it's due to ESPN's lack of women's soccer coverage to begin with combined with the fact that Fox had broadcast rights, so ESPN is really not trying to recognize a sport they're not making money off of. It's either completely snub the individual performances, or put them on the ballot nearly a full year later so that they have no hype and are less  likely to win anything.  edit: Notice the COMPLETE lack of NHL and MLS players in any category that isn't strictly related to their league."
WomensSoccer,3cklej,Crusaruis28,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:36:12 2015 UTC,It's just soccer in general I imagine. And it being women's soccer makes it even lower on the list of priorities. If the USA had lost in the final I guarantee there wouldn't even be a nomination
WomensSoccer,3cklej,SuperZero42,8,Thu Jul 9 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"There is a criminal lack of USWNT award nominations. Carli deserves to be in the Best Championship Performance; none of the ladies are in the Best Female Athlete poll, and the final isn't even in the Best Game category.  Edit: and I can't tell if the site isn't letting me pick the USWNT for best team. Every other poll has a checkmark next to it after I vote, but not this one and Best Play."

"" is exaggerating.    ""According to TV By The Numbers, 20.3 million people watched the 2015 Women's World Cup final.

Or if the US had been playing in the third place game...  Or if the Japanese had jumped out to a 3-0 lead in 16 minutes...  The NBA finals drew those kind of numbers across 6 games over two weeks.

WomensSoccer,3cawsq,speculumfight,18,Mon Jul 6 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Perfect storm of events for the US audience. The Brazil game in 2011, the 2012 Olympics storyline and finish to maintain the momentum, the 2010 and 2014 Men's World Cups growing soccer in general in the US, faces familiar to the non-soccer fan general public in Wambach, Solo, and Morgan, the story line of the drought and Wambach's last chance.  Then the cup starts. Drawing Australia, Sweden, and Nigeria ensuring 3 close games, a thrilling match against our old coach, and a taste of the ""Rising Africa"" story line exemplified across the tournament. Colombia's banter going into knockouts kept the intensity growing, and then an opponent the US public remembers from '99 in China. Then they watch France - Germany for our opponent and what a game they delivered. Now even the lay fan has an idea of just how tough the next game will be. So on the edge of our seats the country watches one of the best games the US has played send us to the final. Well now we want to know who we're playing, introducing us to the drama of England's run and the familiarity of Japan and allowing us to see one of the most heartbreaking moments in Women's World Cup history.   Then we get the rematch, a perfect culmination of a series of events seemingly scripted to capture the attention of an American fanbase. With the criticism of our family and friends who don't watch the sport in the background layering in a constant background noise of ""0 to 0 final scores"" and ""boring"" Carli Lloyd becomes an American Legend in 16 minutes. Goals are flying, Japan is throwing everything they have at the US defense, and nobody watching in any room anywhere couldn't see the raw talent and emotion being hurled into the match from both sides. TV sets that missed the first two goals were centerpieces when Holiday sent her volley into the back of the net, and when Lloyd's most brilliant goal was called with ""hat trick for Lloyd!!"" from the booth.  Then Lloyd is on the ground with her teammates sliding in to wrap their entire bodies around her, Abby is yelling ""finally"" at the camera with a flag across her back, and Ellis is dancing, looking for someone to hug like Jimmy V back from the grave.   And all of it hosted by our closest neighbor with a storyline of disrespect from an organizing body we've just learned to hate.   It was storybook."

WomensSoccer,3cbem7,speculumfight,5,Mon Jul 6 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"There's been much conversation about this but to be honest... no matter how much FIFA spends on the women's side, if the MEDIA doesn't give just as much coverage, even US local FC coverage, then there's never going to be as much money in the sport.  Think about it. How much sport's coverage does your local news coverage due on a daily basis? and how much of that is men's sports? Media coverage means ratings means money.  FIFA WWC 2015 Final garnered the same numbers as the 2014 World Series... now that needs to translate down to more news coverage of our WNBA & NWSL.  One thing that's a good sign is that Fox will broadcast 6 games NWSL... and now after FIFAWWC2015 I am wiling to bet that FOX puts more money in and that number of games (it does include 3 playoff games so altogether 6 isn't spectacular) will go up."

There's coverage on the local news whenever a football game is played. A men's game that is. There's coverage for women in other sports, tennis and athletics mainly, but I don't think I've ever seen coverage on the news for any of the women's football league results.  We've got BT Sport picking up some WSL games as well at least. Shame it's not free-to-air but BT seem to be buying all the football coverage these days.  Hoping the Women's FA Cup final on the BBC gets at least as big an audience as the Lionesses have done on average (1-2mil). That'd be a good start."

I do wish BBC wasn't geolocked here to the US but at least I can find a GOOD HD free to stream elsewhere for those games, but it's the FOX games that are annoying. I can't find a good HD stream ever unless I pay. BUT... the NWSL games are free on their site and are HD :) I dunno if they're geolocked but since it's US soccer teams I can watch.  http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13201992/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-mia-hamm-us-wins-dramatic-world-cup-title  I'd totally love to watch women's English football but have NO idea about the teams like here on the NWSL side."

We've tried before...just as we tried with Women's basketball (at least 2 attempts and then finally the WNBA). It's given us a great base to pull player's from after they live college. NWSL even has players that played on other national teams. England's own Taylor and Germany's Angerer both play for Portland Thorns come to mind immediately.  So yeah, I guess we're lucky in that regard. However, while I do somewhat agree with the 50/50 split in regards to coverage... the pay differential is horrific."
WomensSoccer,3cbem7,katiepult,2,Mon Jul 6 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Same here, I can't see the NWSL going under again following the World Cup win either. Be such a huge disappointment.   The pay difference is one of the most embarrassing parts. Though I think over there a lot of your players, the big names at least, get a lot of sponsors, Alex Morgan must be worth millions. Apparently our highest earner is on something like £70k total."
WomensSoccer,3cbem7,Breatheher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:05 2015 UTC,Yeah Alex has Nationwide as a sponsor and a couple others I think. Which REALLY helps with advertising Portland Thorns games :P  edit: And apparently Beats by Dress which I just saw her tweet the ad for. Jeez woman

Each time a team was eliminated you really got a sense that the players had sacrificed a lot just to play the sport they love. Great respect for them.  And what an end to this cup!

USA came out to one of the most incredible starts I’ve ever witnessed in any sporting event, and it won them the game. Or Carli Lloyd won them the game. We knew she was that old cliche, a big game player. But we didn’t know she was that good. Take away her goals, and it was a pretty even game - and the second-half in particular was a more balanced affair. But then USA didn’t need to be particularly good in the second period - because they had Lloyd.  USA were pedestrian in the group stages, they looked like a once great team slouching forward on past glories. Ellis looked out of ideas. But they transformed in the semi-final, thanks to clevee coaching a brilliant individual performances. Ellis was smiling at the start of the game: she knew how good the US were - and soon we would too.   http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jul/05/womens-world-cup-2015-final-usa-v-japan-live"

WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,trashturt,4,Sun Jul 5 23:55:55 2015 UTC,How can anyone say that a team that has made this far doesn't deserve to win? Solo's done a fine job thus far and no team deserves to lose because of your misplaced contempt for the keeper
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,3,Sun Jul 5 23:42:11 2015 UTC,If he was proven guilty sure. The charges against Solo were dropped.
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,5,Sun Jul 5 23:54:20 2015 UTC,What are you? The Meninist conspiracy police?
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,4,Mon Jul 6 00:10:15 2015 UTC,Hey bro.

WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:29:25 2015 UTC,Bet he was absolutely raging!
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,3,Mon Jul 6 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"I hate hope solo, she doesn't deserve to win.   Very curious as to why?"
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,5,Mon Jul 6 02:08:45 2015 UTC,the only reason she is forgiven is because she's a woman.   Well this is just daft. The law states that it's innocent until proven guilty. Has Hope Solo been proven guilty? No.   I don't judge people based on allegations.
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Breatheher,4,Mon Jul 6 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"Mayweather has been convicted multiple times, and plead guilty for most of them."
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,LasigArpanet,6,Mon Jul 6 12:24:51 2015 UTC,because she's a woman   Oh shove off!
WomensSoccer,3c8ojf,Velvetrose-2,3,Sun Jul 5 23:51:55 2015 UTC,She is a domestic abuser    It sounds like Hope's nephew was also at fault.
