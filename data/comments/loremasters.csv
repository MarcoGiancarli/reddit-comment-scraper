loremasters,3e32hg,RiskyTrizkit,29,Tue Jul 21 16:07:39 2015 UTC,A deconstituted water elemental of epic size trying to put itself back together seems like a cool idea.
loremasters,3e32hg,drakefyre,21,Tue Jul 21 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Damn. That is a fantastic idea. I could see people settling near its body mass to gather water since he would basically be a lake. Maybe it delays his reconstitution for milennia, and when he is finally complete, he decides to take a revenge stroll on the settlements. Boom, campaign."

loremasters,3e32hg,Kadakism,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Weißyr was the Primus of Water, a being of ancient elemental fury who once threatened to drown out all life. The other Primuses, Sûnna of Flame, Hofgrïr of Earth, and Ræl of Air did not wish to see the world decimated so.  Sûnna sacrificed itself evaporating Weißyr into constituent parts. Hofgrïr locked these droplets within the earth, creating vast underground lakes of water all around the planet. However, Weißyr's consciousness still thrived, and it struggled to break free of its stony prison. Ræl took to policing the escaped droplets, scattering them into the wind as clouds until the Water Primus could no longer control them, at which point Ræl would send them back to the earth as rain.  Occasionally Weißyr regains control of these free floating parts and urges them towards large bodies of surface water, where the two remaining Primuses cannot entrap them again. If it can reclaim all of its pieces, Weißyr will wreak vengence upon the world for the millennia it has been entrapped."

Been wanting to run something epic in scale but smaller in playtime. Now my brain is flipping around other elementals and how it would work.   Dormant Volcano finally receives the allspark and erupts, birthing a massive magma elemental.   Wind elemental... a cloud, lost within a mountain range has become trapped over a small village for millennia. the storm of the century dislodges it and it reconstitutes in the village square. It doesn't mean any harm, and has grown to love the little beings that live in its shade, but do they know that?  Earth... Small island awaits the return of Akupara, the world turtle that left with much of it's body centuries ago. When Akupara arrives the villagers discover that they live on the back of a giant earth elemental. The cranky elder is staying, for better or worse.  Together they form voltron or some shit, I don't know."

loremasters,3e32hg,werewolf_nr,9,Tue Jul 21 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"Long ago the Goddess of the Earth and the Goddess of the Sky quarreled bitterly.  They fought over who would control the water, as it was in both their domains.  They argued endlessly, and their arguments became violent storms which smashed ships and buildings into kindling.  The people of the mortal plane cried out for deliverance, and one god answered their cries.  The minor God of Trickery and Deception talked to the Goddess, who were both more powerful then him, and suggested a compromise.  The Sky Goddess would control all the water in sky as Clouds, and the Earth Goddess would control all the water on the ground, where she could fill great flat lands with it, to form the seas.  And all the water in between would be controlled by him.  The Goddess did not want to give up any of their power, but decided they were technically losing nothing, and thus could find no reason to refuse.    so water has three states.  In the Sky as Clouds, on the Earth in the Seas, and flying through the air as free floating clouds, smashing stuff, knocking over people, and sweeping away possessions."

This rain occurs from clouds that leak into the Plane of Water and produce Water Micrids, tiny elementals. The other elemental planes have similar beings: In the deep places of the world, there are Earth Micrids that look like pebbles, rolling about on the floor and walls of caverns and burrowing through the earth; there are Fire Micrids, scourge of blacksmiths and wizards, which leap from fires and scurry onto walls, floors and ceilings (especially thatched ones), briefly singeing most things and outright burning the more flammable; and there are Air Micrids, incredibly difficult to see with the naked eye, but whose presence can be detected by erratic and dangerous flights of small birds and insects in the area.  TL;DR: Elemental insects - flying water droplets, rolling/burrowing pebbles, invisible and powerful eddies that destabilize tiny flying creatures and small embers that sometimes leap across surfaces, singeing everything they touch."

This one was most likely a failed experiment by a wizard becoming a lich, but due to the nature of the world, the way it failed turned it into a Dungeon.  Or something.  I was inspired mostly by the webcomic Goblins, with the way that dungeon crawls are just a part of the world that nobody questions."

I was talking to my wife yesterday, and we decided that air, the evil one, was a gem that gets destroyed. So it doesn't go back inside a container, it is free and by your side the entire time, patiently waiting for all three wishes. After the third it is free to go about its business, and you are then enslaved into a container (Probably your flute/pipe) and become the ""genie"" for the next person. Can't grant wishes, but does become the unfailing, indentured servant of whoever finds it. They remain themselves, but follow any and all orders without fail."

Violator and Shredder (you are talking about the TMNT Shredder, right?) or Kraven, for instance, are set in really, really different settings. Would you really put, say, Catwoman and Violator in a fight? So I think you should pick a smaller number of comic book characters, start with these, and possibly expand later, depending on how things go.  On the other hand, having a Civil War in this setting, or a Secret Invasion, sounds interesting."

Genuinely curious about this.
loremasters,3dg2iv,FoxtrotTangoSera,2,Thu Jul 16 03:03:58 2015 UTC,You could introduce something like replanting a dryad's tree and threatening to cut it down if they don't make crops grow.  Or some other hostage type leverage like that.

A theological war between pantheists and polytheists from the cities sounds like it could be an interesting campaign. Otherwise the druids would probably just roll over these rabble if something sacred to them was being threatened. These are men that revere nature red in tooth and claw, not the tenants of chivalry. They don't have to play nice."
loremasters,3dg2iv,FoxtrotTangoSera,0,Fri Jul 17 00:17:49 2015 UTC,Because it makes a good story. Hush.
loremasters,3dg2iv,S-nine,3,Fri Jul 17 10:18:59 2015 UTC,"I like it, here's what I offer though:  The druids wouldn't have standing armies, but they probably can adopt in a few squads of animals as a ""beast master"" archtype of some kind. The ""invasion"" of the refugees cutting down swaths of forest for new homes and farming leads to the druids adapting into a guerrilla tactics of seizing when luck meets opportunity and some self-crafted luck as well. Makes for some simple ""find person X, bring them back for questioning/kill them"" and can be used to lead into more plots later and gives a basis for adventuring and money making. The party should be motivated to do some of this without money. They have families among the refugees. Not doing this means that they starve, etc. Money shouldn't be everything but it is a means to an end as well, sometimes though food is worth more than gold.  If you want to create a villain, a older druid leader is banding together druids of all sorts, good and evil ones in an attempt to refute the refugee threat to the natural order of things. Some druids seeing an attempt to get in on the going, might even pretend to be good, increasing the harvest only to allow the evil ones in later to suddenly ruin the crop in a massive ritual of desiccation. Then you have starving people all blaming the druids and someone incites a riot and now you've got yourself a good ol witch-burning of a druid that has befriended the party and isn't part of any of this.  I'd give a small overarching reason for 'why' the druids won't help, this probably won't be player knowledge for a long time, but gives your bigger villains motivations as to why they are doing what they are doing. It helps you keep in mind their perspective and how they need to react. Perhaps the forest contains a sacred grove of dryads all very powerful and protecting something more powerful that keeps the world turning. Not something that the players themselves could ever use but something that the necro-cult is after which would also give a reason for the chase of the zombie horde into the forests because otherwise the necromancer has what he'd want. Now he wants to find some way to become a lich and that artifact is just want he needs."
loremasters,3dg2iv,freedomischaos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help. Maybe I could place some sort of large magical tree that allows such a large forest to thrive despite disaster and weather conditions. This tree is praised by druid elders and is apart of many ceremonies. Due to the refugee expansion, the tree's very large and expansive roots are being disturbed thus making the druids angry."
loremasters,3dg2iv,Yami-Bakura,2,Thu Jul 16 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"I have goblin refugees, mercenaries, and thieves probably hired by a town leader or noble still in some power capture them. (Thanks for pointing out a flaw in the idea. Feel free to point out more so I can try and work around them.)"
loremasters,3dad46,Asmor,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"That is eeriely resonating with me. In my epic level 4e campaign that I'm DMing an entity with the secret of Death was excised from reality by the world-entity in an attempt to ""fix"" it. Cutting out a part of itself, it created a micro-reality entirely separated, outside from the original reality. The world-entity is trying to heal the wound left behind but the piece of itself that it excised is understandably not happy and is trying to destroy the world entity that excised it. All possible Fates indicate failure, destruction of everything in one way or another, except one. That's the one reality my party is trying to save."
loremasters,3d7r5y,bigguybrums,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Just spit balling ideas.  Perhaps one or some of the working girls holds Deep One DNA, and need them for breeding purposes.  Or, what they're actually gathering these girls for is sacrifice to the Great Ones, and if they have their way, opening a portal from beyond.  The safehouse could have some objects that cause them staying to enter the Dream Relm, where they're given clues from Azathoth about what's to come.   Really, world locations would depend on which entity is the big nasty here.  Using Cthulu could send them to Australia, or the Polynesia Isles, while Chaugnar Faughn might take them to India.  Regardless, cult worship all over the world is pretty much the same."
loremasters,3d7r5y,2meterrichard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the girls are being sacrificed to the Old Ones.  I've got a sick haunted house type scenario for them to walk into at the safehouse, complete with a staircase in the basement that goes down, down, where they meet the soulless, walking corpses.    The PCs will face a choice as to what they want to do when they get to the safehouse.  They can let the girls be sacrificed, or they can save them.  The mafia knows their families and everything, so they have collateral.    I am thinking they find an old subway map with markings on it which will make them have to set out and explore.  My concern is tying the party together.  What makes them stay together after this?  Something to tie them together, give them the sense that if they don't act to stop this, no one will.  And no one will believe them if they go to the police (and obviously the police are corrupt)."
loremasters,3d7r5y,2meterrichard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"I like it. Kinda wish I was playing in that. Flooded abandoned subway tunnels are a perfect place for some critter encounters.  To start with a decent bond, make them team up by the mob, either it's a paying job, or they're doing it out of blackmail. I've had the problem of getting the group together with a CoC game before. Two players were working together perfectly (they were a paranormal investigator team. Think Ghosthunters), the other was an old school private detective. Their searches kept leading them to pass each other by, but neither had a reason to approach each other.  The PI was actually on their suspect list until shit got weird.  I was about to do a big reveal when I told the PI player ""this is where I have to force your hand and get you inside the house."" When the sanity started dropping they all found better safety in numbers.   Tl;dr The unspeakable terrors in the dark sometimes form the strongest bond."
loremasters,3d5gqk,ZansibarStanley,3,Mon Jul 13 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"Wait so first of all, is he going to be spending most of his time in a shop selling items?  Is this a one-on-one campaign, or will there be other players doin' more traditional adventuring stuff?  Other than that, as far as economics go, I would think you could keep it fairly simple for a regular merchant in what I'm assuming is a fantasy setting.  Mostly going to boil down to buying something in bulk shipments at a cheaper price and selling at a higher one (or getting unique items from your adventurer friends and reselling those.)  Depending on the city and perhaps nation he's operating in, you could add in things like loans and contracts and whatnot.  A merchants' guild might provide for some good RP and conflict.  Common troubles that befall merchants:    Bandits stealing or destroying shipments.  Especially problematic if the merchant paid in advance.  Thieves/burglars breaking into shop.  Competitor with ridiculously low prices (could be black market fence, grave robber, selling expired food.)  Competitor somehow disrupts supply chain, perhaps through intimidation of suppliers or exclusive contracts.  Spread of bad reputation for store or goods, either deserved or fabricated.  One of my favorites, extortion from criminal elements.  Supplier offers great prices, but won't talk too much about their source.   Those are kind of the basics, obviously need a lot of fleshing out and probably some twists to make them more interesting."
loremasters,3d5gqk,Falkjaer,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"We have been talking about making it a bit of a split: he is going to start out with nothing as an adventurer and working towards becoming a traveling merchant, so his time would be split between manning the shop and gathering materials to sell/traveling. It started as a one-on-one campaign, but another player may be joining us (we were basically going to be switching off running 1-on-1 games, and then one of our friends decided he wanted to play too, and he hasn't decided which game to join). The other player would probably be playing a body-guard/partner for the merchant.   Thanks :D"
loremasters,3d5gqk,marco262,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"One thing he may enjoy is running the shop as an absentee owner. If you're playing 5e, the DMG has some good mechanics for owning a business as an adventurer. I recommend taking a look at that.  He could probably start with a small shop that's manned by a local teenager that he's paying pennies to maintain while he's gone. This way, he could always return home to a small (very small, because the teenager sucks at his job) profit after each adventure.  This could also spread to him opening further locations, and setting up regular deliveries between his locations. This would mean he wouldn't be the only one in charge of the shop, but he'll have to pay wages and manage personnel to some degree, which might or might not be fun for your player."
loremasters,3d5gqk,peacefinder,3,Mon Jul 13 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"For inspiration, look at the history of the spice trade. Spices such as pepper, cloves, and nutmeg were all worth fantastic amounts of money far from their sources. Exploring to find the source of a spice (for the ultimate buy low, sell high return) would make a great merchant quest hook."
loremasters,3d5gqk,GilliamtheButcher,2,Mon Jul 13 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true. If you read any books about the spice trade, /u/ZansibarStanley, getting there is an adventure in itself:   Figuring out which officials to bribe Discovering which trinkets sell better in different locales Survival skills to get where you're going - from extreme cold and snowstorms to extreme heat and sandstorms, from traversing steppes to navigating swamps. Trying to find alternate routes to avoid tolls (for bridges, towns, and paying off highwaymen) Fighting off raiders and pirates Dealing with adamant beggars Skirting border skirmishes between small warbands   I haven't played it, but there's a Pathfinder Adventure Path called Jade Regent that seems to cover this sort of thing."
loremasters,3d5gqk,Cheapskate-DM,3,Tue Jul 14 06:21:32 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is whether or not his mercantile aspirations will jive with the rest of the party. As such, you could look into:  -Playing as multiple characters, an offer that could be extended to the other players - knight with a squire, etc.  -A bodyguard ""familiar""; use whatever ""balanced"" analogue suits you, such as the Summoner class. (Not terribly familiar with PF's crunch.)  -The merchant as an NPC, whom the player's more combat-oriented (but still greedy) character is closely related to. The merchant-NPC's business could then become a party affair, spearheaded by your player, rather than an exclusive hobby.  However, I can't speak to the difficulties of running an economic challenge. The best I can offer is to starve your players of free gold and give them a need to spend money. Just as hunger as the best spice, being broke makes every coin they earn that much more enticing."
loremasters,3d5gqk,HailToTheGM,2,Tue Jul 14 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"What about a caravan merchant and his guard(s)? He could travel from town to town with a wagon full of goods, adventuring along the way and selling the spoils.  He could spend profits on upgrades for his wagon - things like a sleeping compartment, fold-down sides to display wares, armor plating, mounted revolving ballista, etc.  Depending on how far you want to take it, that could progress to buying out other caravans, ""hostile takeovers"" of his competitors, establishing storefronts in towns, or maybe dealing with the local duke who has decided that all caravans in his territory must be registered, searched for ""contraband,"" and heavily taxed...  It might be a fun campaign opener to have them start in the middle of a ""salvage operation"" just as it goes wrong - looting an abandoned silver mine just as they begin to hear the shreaks of kobolds echo down the corridors.  ""Damn it! 'A quick, easy job.' That's what you said. Now look what we've gotten into!"""
loremasters,3d5gqk,JollyO,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"As for the economics each business has  fixed and variable costs.  Fixed costs = rent, insurance,  advertising,  etc Variable costs = cost of materials,  production costs  FC+VC=Total Cost  So you could have him figure out the cost of doing business,  how much he needs to earn each month to stay in business (needs to be more than average fixed cost) and how much of his product he needs to sell to do that.   Then you can introduce shortages of a material needed to make his product due to a ship wreck forcing him to increase his price or experience a shortage.  But that might be too businessey. But i bet if you spend some time on investopedia or kahn academt reading about behavioral economics and costs of production you could create a d100 roll sheet to randomize the events that might effect a business. Mix i  positives and negatives.  Oh man, that include stuff like, forcing him to make moral decisions like, a local mine collapsed and your the only one in town with shovels and pickaxes.    The increased demand means you can increase your prices many times over. But if you price gouge the people will resent you. But if you donate them they might view you a hero.  Man, this sounds like a fun campaign for boring econ hobbyists like me haha.  Other things; taxes and how he responds to them. Banking and getting loans for expansion or too buy valuable goods. Interest rates. What happens when debts aren't paid? Franchising.  Maybe you work out some sort of reputation system to determine if people know who he is in far away towns and what their perception of his goods are.   Maybe he hires a bard to single jingles of his esteemed business. Or he contracts exclusive rights to a renowned blacksmith for his swords.   Tons of ideas!"

loremasters,3d5gqk,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:55:03 2015 UTC,"Silk Road:       The Silk Road or Silk Route is an ancient network of trade and cultural transmission routes that were central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the West and East by merchants, pilgrims, monks, soldiers, nomads, and urban dwellers from China and India to the Mediterranean Sea during various periods of time.   Extending 4,000 miles (6,437 kilometres), the Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in Chinese silk carried out along its length, beginning during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The Central Asian sections of the trade routes were expanded around 114 BC by the Han dynasty, largely through the missions and explorations of Chinese imperial envoy, Zhang Qian.  The Chinese took great interest in the safety of their trade products and extended the Great Wall of China to ensure the protection of the trade route.   Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of China, the Indian subcontinent, Persia, Europe, the Horn of Africa and Arabia, opening long-distance, political and economic relations between the civilizations.  Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, many other goods were traded, and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also travelled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.   The main traders during antiquity were the Chinese, Persians, Somalis, Greeks, Syrians, Romans, Armenians, Indians, and Bactrians, and from the 5th to the 8th century the Sogdians. Following the emergence of Islam, Arab traders became prominent.  In June 2014 UNESCO designated the Chang'an-Tianshan corridor of the Silk Road as a World Heritage Site.

loremasters,3d5gqk,red_rabeit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:55:16 2015 UTC,I would suggest another system. DnD is not made for housing a merchant trading game; it is made for murdering monsters and taking their gold. I do however wish you best of luck if you attempt to use pathfinder.
loremasters,3d5gqk,Iamwetodddidtwo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone has some great ideas here. A few mentioned it but I can't stress enough that if you want to run this type of game it will be paramount that he be either a traveling caravan merchant or a sailor/captain.  This allows you a much greater degree of freedom and versatility. So not only is the mundane buying goods for cheap and selling them for profit involved, but it allows to to insert a host of hooks easily as well.  Some examples:  Bandits/pirates  Toll road/docking tolls  Damaged traveling equipment - boat/wagon  Animal attacks - kraken/bears  Wealthy mans asks you to ""find me this object"" for a great fee  Smuggling past customs  Extortion  Skirting war territory while taking advantage of profits to be made within the area  Difficulties of transporting animals  Uncharted territory  Seeking out highly rare goods for profit  Giving loans/collecting payments  Competitors sabotage for or against  Human trafficking, not just bad things but like smuggling political refugees out of a country  Paid espionage, merchants make great spies  That's about all that I can think of at the moment. I'll post more if any come to mind, but i think you see the advantage in keeping the PC traveling and seeking out goods and buyers. Even if they have a home base which can be very fun to design and build up keep that player always hunting and you have an excuse to put almost any normal adventure in front of them just for more specific reasons. If you are clever convince the player to have both land and sea travel as a merchant. They can have employees as well to manage but the games focus should be on the PC themselves."
loremasters,3d5gqk,Khavrion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"(Possible) Starting hook: In an adventure, he stumbles upon an incredibly large amount of one resource - too much to be able to sell effectively.  I heard of this in a Cyberpunk setting, so the look was something like several dozen crates of guns, but you could do something analogous like discovering an ancient elven armory or something.  At any rate, it's far too much for you to fork off at once (who needs a hundred longbows?  And besides, who has enough money to buy them at once?  D&D 3.5 in the DMG has rules for how much money a community has to spend on buying loot, I recommend poking that).  The adventure becomes selling it.  And you often get barter, too - trade the longbows for armor, the armor for magic items, etc., and, as things go, you've now got your simulated merchant fun."

This extended look at the history of the world is cool, but kind of meaningless.  I wouldn't even bring it up, as I doubt most of the players won't notice or care.

loremasters,3cue6z,Hydrall_Urakan,2,Fri Jul 10 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Generally what I'm hoping for from it is something generally lower fantasy - Not necessarily magicless, but DnD's clerics being able to generate infinite food and such, and cure any disease? That would ruin this campaign idea in an instant.   Actually, you can work around this in D&D with a local magical something or other that impedes healing. Maybe an overabundance of positive energy makes casting any healing magic cause accelerated plant or fungal growth (lethally so for spells of 3rd level or higher). Or make the area be severed from the Feywild, making all healing spells require a DC 10 plus 5 times spell level Wisdom check to cast.  Anyways, there's lots of other systems. FATE Core wouldn't be a bad one because you could track sanity or food resources with a stress track, the same as PC stress."
loremasters,3cue6z,thomar,2,Fri Jul 10 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"Pathologic fits really well with fate from a narrative standpoint; the game is very high concept and has well developed overarching themes that inform both the story and gameplay.   On the other hand it would probably be much more difficult to model the mechanics as they currently exist in Fate because the system doesn't handle resource management very elegantly. This might be fine though as you can model most things with temporary aspects and stress tracks, and the important thing really is the narrative effect of these resources being scarce."
loremasters,3cue6z,spookyjeff,2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:31 2015 UTC,"Why try and shoehorn DnD into something that quite frankly it will never do well?

Sure you can hack it but why bother when there are far easier and better solutions to your problem?   Try BRP, Gumshoe, or Apocalypse World. Hope this helped a bit.   Edit: i see that some people have suggested Fate, if you want tension and fear don't go with it. Its a great system but having someone be able to spend a fate point to ""find an old can of food"" behind the counter defeats the purpose of a survival game."

loremasters,3cq8bw,KnightNight-,5,Thu Jul 9 22:13:22 2015 UTC,"I had a very good, inspiring experience playing Torchbearer but it's extremely procedural - I'd almost suggest it's nearly the opposite of what you're looking for.  Burning Wheel is probably way closer to what you're looking for - it's all about character development, play experiences driven by personal motivations, sacrifice, and there are good pacing and interesting-failure tools built into the core of resolution.  (The two games have a bit of overlap in resolution and advancement, but they play so differently it's misleading to consider them based on the same engine.)  BW does have a bias against detailed backstories; at least, people need to be willing to be flexible. Its whole schtick is character transformation and compromise, unexpected outcomes - it doesn't work if you have a party show up with dollhouses, who want their character concepts protected from change.  On the other hand, the lifepath chargen system does make kick-ass backstory skeletons, since you know what your character's been doing (at least in broad strokes) since birth."
loremasters,3cq8bw,fuseboy,2,Fri Jul 10 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"Torchbearer is a RPG, but it also isn't. It is more boardgame-y. Dunno what a numbskull recommended that game for you. It does one thing better than every other game: Dungeon Crawls. No other game will get more tense while exploring old ruins, thanks to the great mechanics.  You know the PC game Darkest Dungeon? They pretty much copied Torchbearer.      Look at Burning Wheel. The best RPG targeted at character development and story. You can start with a fighter but end up with a healer character.  It's GURPS for RP only, doesn't have great combat mechanics. (It has 3 different combat mechanics for different situations +1 for concealment and ranged combat.)    Maybe Runequest 6? Combat is solved very quickly and is deadly, which may be great for your players that love tactics. But it also does not get bogged down because it ends with around 1-3 rolls.  Also it has many skills and it is a toolbox, like GURPS, but much more streamlined. Also there are like a million supplements from other d100 games out there."

I had three friends make characters and played through the premade story.  Combat was just slow and tedious, to me.  I played a lot of DND2.0 and GURPS, but something about the combat was just off.  I get that the game was supposed to be a throwback to the old style of games, but I feel as though it just created a bad combat system.  Some things I really, really liked.  The book had a lot of tables for town events and random organizations in the town, which was really nice.  Your health is depicted by a group of status affects instead of straight-up HP, which is very interesting.  If you do character creation by the book, it is like creating a small biography for your character which builds backstory right then and there.  I loved that, too.  I did not like the severely limited selection of races/classes (which harkens back to 2.0, but I didn't like it then, either).  I would definitely use the town, character creation, and tables in another game any day.  The health system, if appropriate, I would also carry over.  I wouldn't touch the combat ever again."

The two would have different ways of handling such a situation. Devils like to manipulate people into worse and worse situations, and twist the words of their dealings, but they also prefer not to 'alter the agreement'. Their ideal is when a situation ends up torturing some soul caught in it's bounds for life. Demons like to sow chaos, watch more and more things break down until everything falls apart. Their ideal situation is where nothing but a smoking crater remains. A devil would likely offer power to the Tieflings with which to destroy the humans, a classic situation, at some terrible price, perhaps one that further entrenches them such as human sacrifices.  Then they would go back to the humans and do the same. Rinse, repeat. A demon would go ahead and steal the children regardless of deal, kill them, and them stack them in the Tieflings' town, with all evidence pointing to their leader. Then it would watch as the Tieflings turned on their own leader while the humans came for their blood. It might drop some necromantic items around town to get the undead into the fight, to make absolutely sure everyone was put to the sword.

loremasters,3cgso9,Zahnan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"It looks like a donut bead (might actually be a picture of a donut bead). Lots of people wear those as pendants, but 6 inches is a bit big for a pendant. If it were say, 6 centimeters, or even less, then I might have an idea:    All party members blackout after the initiation, and awake to find they have fine chains circling their neck. The chains have no clasp, are unbreakable, and are too small to fit over the head. One of the party has the artifact hanging from a loop on the chain. But if another member starts to tug on theirs so it slides around their neck, the chains on everyone's necks begin to slide around, the artifact going up and behind the person's head, disapearing when it's no longer in view, and reappearing from behind one of the others. In this way the artifact, and the same chain, is technically being worn by all party members at the same time. Where the artifact disappears to is a mystery, and if someone stands behind a person to watch, it simply disappears at some other point where it can't be seen. Experimenting with this would turn out to have uncomfortable revelations for the party, so hopefully they do not do it.    The chain turning could also be a simple means of allowing the party to communicate or signal each other. ""Two tugs left of the chain when it's safe to move"", ""We'll pass you the pendant when  we're about to break you out"", that kind of thing. With the inability to actually drop or separate themselves from the artifact, they are functionally unable to lose it. It can't even be taken from them, as the chain is unbreakable (it's a part of the artifact). The only problem left is if someone cuts off a party member's headas they're currently in possession of the artifact, to gain possession of, or rid the party of, the artifact.   What simply happens is the artifact continues to function as normal,  and when a party member pulls on the chain, it's pulled around as normal, vanishing as soon as it's out of sight. If they don't it simple appears on some part of the chain still worn, when it and the part of the chain are both not observed. Any length of chain left with no artifact and no neck, is suddenly found to be a weak, brittle metal that snaps at the lightest tug, and rapidly tarnishes away to nothing. It may break simply from the final tug that bore the artifact out of sight, leaving a simple discarded piece of trash behind, that looks as if the artifact itself broke free and wandered off."
loremasters,3cgso9,burnerthrown,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"It is indeed a pendant that I used for the basis of the idea, but in game it is not at all. The object is 6 inches across, and has no weight when carried by one of the marked players. The design of the hole allows things to appear in the center (such as a compass arrow), but also allows a player to put it on a string and wear it around their neck if they so choose.   While your idea is certainly interesting, it sounds like it's something entirely different. It's not meant at all to be imprisoning, it's an object binding to it's new masters. In this case, it reached out, and simply bound to the only sentient creatures around.   Chains signify subservience, where as the key is meant to be empowering for the place they will soon find themselves. Imagine an infinitely large house with millions of locked doors. Now you suddenly find yourself within this house, and you somehow came across a master key that can unlock every door. That's what this object is really meant to be. To ensure he never lost it, the original owner had it bound to him."
loremasters,3cgso9,burnerthrown,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"Well that's simple then. If it's the key to all the doors, if abandoned it simply returns to room behind the single, solitary door that can be opened without it. If they can't go anywhere else without a key and the key is there if they lose it, they kind of have to take it with them. After they leave the plae of many doors, it's not necessary anymore."

The armor cannot be pierced, but is extremely hot to wear, to the point where most soldiers have permanent skin disfigurations from the constant burns. The swords are extremely hard to dodge because you can't see its depth. The armor is difficult to hit for similar reasons. Touching it, both as wielder and victim, is painful due to all the heat it absorbs.  This material can be collected and used by the party, but the player takes damage each turn.   Also the encounter will begin with the party investigating what appears to be a mini black hole in the sky (invader ship).

That doesn't make it hot or cold to the touch, except if you have liquid nitrogen or a heat lamp on the other side or something.  Just for comparison, another material with high termal conductivity would be copper. Take out a penny and feel it, take it into your close palm.

I don't know, if your campaign takes place in historically - accurate universe, or some made up place that is just similar, but i'll try to help.  Some things about polish ressistance, that may become handy:   It was commanded by goverment in exile in London. So you can have some soldiers loathing, that commandment does not feel the danger of close death, that they are detached from reality. Coming Red Army was NOT friendly to the freedom fighters who weren't communists. They were theated like a bandits, being arrested and killed. So ressistance fighters are NOT happy, that Red army is coming to ""rescue them"". Some people think that it's better to be enslaved than dead, some want to use any chance they have to earn freedom, even with a cost of their lives. When Red Army comes closer and closer, you can have some ressisance fighters and/or civilians betraying your PCs to join it, because ""there is no choice"" or ""I'm not going to die for stupid ideology, we are not going to be free anyway"". Ressistance was not homogeneous. The biggest organisation was Home Army, with military roots. Thus it's military-like structure. There also were smaller millitias, who are under HA commandment, with various degrees of freedom. And there were groups fighting with germans that weren't under HA jurisdiction - like communists, fascists - but they were a minority. When Red Army is near, Nazis may decide to completely eradicate the city from the face of the earth and kill everyone (including civilians) inside. That's what they did with Warsaw in real life. I guess, it would be quite shocking news for your PCs, when they would have to participate in crazy retreat, and nice way to end the campaign. Many people lost their loved ones. It is anger, patriotism and venegace, what fuels many ressisance fighters. Some of them just want to kill Germans, or help your PCs to do so. Even if this makes not sense and is against their orders.  You will find many young zealous people, who want to join the ressistance. They are full of false hope, that Allies will eventually come and save them from Nazis and Soviets, they just need to show that they are trying to free themselves. Especially that there are news coming from Allies that bring promises ""We won't leave our ally alone!"" but no hard information. The closer Soviets are, the more shattered this illusion becomes. Your PCs may find ressistance via something called ""small ressistance"". It's a group of non-fighting participants who paint uplifting grafitti, vandalise nazi building, and homes of persons collaborating with them, steals nazi flags, destroys propaganda posters. It's more likely to find in the street them than actual fighting soldiers, who usually are incognito daytime, and operate in nighttime. Homemande flamethrowers and guns. Just... just that. They existed. They were quite primitive, but easy to make and repair... if you had parts. Oh, and ressistance also made their own armored car, that was practicly immune to normal handguns fire (covered in 20mm steel plates). It was used for soldier transportation in Warsaw Uprising, where ressistance didn't had to hide. I think that mission where PCs gather some materials for ""secret project"" may be interesting. Ressisnace fighters often used canals for secret transportation. There even were jews hidden there, sitting silent in darkness for years in overwhelming stink, spending their's last riches to pay for food someone brought down. Imagine what something like this does to people. And... hiding jews was sentenced by death.   If you want to know something more, contact me."
loremasters,3c8r0c,Hinadira,3,Mon Jul 6 12:12:38 2015 UTC,"Given that OP is running a fantasy game, the last one implies a lot more possible conflicts.  With your resistance fighters being driven underground into the old sewer systems or ancient city infrastructure, who's to say that it hasn't been inhabited this whole time by various monsters who resent this intrusion? For pathfinder an aberration infestation would easily fit.  Examples:   The players navigate must from one part of the city to the other using abandoned underground routes that take them past lairs of monsters and dangerous terrain, using stealth, combat, or diplomacy to get past the different creatures.  Done right, they might even be able to gain some allies.  To establish a base of operations in a new section of the city, the party must drive out the existing residents, like kicking out a lair of goblins from a sewer or cloakers from an abandoned tower. The resistance's supplies, supply lines, or safe house is threatened by some horror from the deep driven to the surface by all the action.   These could also work if you wanted to keep it a less fantastical game, just use different outcast groups instead of monsters and they function pretty much the same."

Mission wise, think what an invading army would have to do to establish themselves, and how the players could tear that all down. For more combat oriented missions, think things like destroying supply lines, poisoning the water supply, sabotaging equipment, and assassinating officials.   If your players like more roleplaying, you can have them do things to affect the army's morale. Think about how the army would be seen by the townsfolk, are they an occupying force, or a liberating one? If there's already dissent in the town, how can they make it larger and more violent? Can they inspire more people to rebel, or even retake the city? If the occupation is seen as beneficial, there's got to be someone who doesn't like the new regime. Think about whether the players can start resistance pockets of their own, and the consequences of that.   Something else to think about all this are the consequences. Suppose they blow up a ship in the harbor, and someone else gets blamed for it. Will they be able to save them? If it comes out that they let someone else take the fall, what does that do to their public image?   You can also think about what steps the army is going to take to silence them. Standard lining up suspicious persons and executing them? Attempting to ferret them out by using spies? They should get more and more desperate as more damaged is caused as well. And what's the bulk of the army doing at the same time? Did they stay in the city, or keep going on campaign? If they moved on, how many are garrisoning the city?  Finally, whats going on with the allied army at the same time? What can the players do to aid them, apart from general resistance? Are there military plans to steal? Supplies to redirect to their side? And how can they get them back into the city as fast as possible?   As far as NPC's, I'd usually make a list of people from each side, and the city proper. Obviously the enemy army has leadership; do the big guys make camp there, or keep going with their army? Who's left in charge of the city? Do they have trusted lieutenants? Are there any collaborators from the general population? How are they treated by the rest of the town?   Are there any defectors from the new army? Maybe a jr lieutenant that's become disillusioned with the war, and just wants to go home. Or a high official with a taste for the finer things in life, and the loose morals that accompany that taste? You could have them stumble upon some information implicating an officer that could be used for blackmail, to force them to look the other way.   Are there any other resistance groups left by the allied army? Are they separate, autonomous groups, or are they in contact with the players? Do they have the same goals in mind, or have they gone rogue? A mission could involve a group that accidentally keeps getting in the way of the player's sabotage through acts of their own.   Which townspeople are left behind, and who's gone with the original army? Tensions would be running high, maybe some families have been split up or become refugees because the fighting. Did the new army establish their own puppet government, or leave the old guard in place? And who are they, and what goals do they have?   Just a couple thoughts, I might have rambled on there a bit though haha."

They start working with corrupt people in the arriving army to bring in supplies etc.  They use these contacts to keep tabs on what is happening in the enemies camp while also using it to undermine them.  They start blackmailing people, setting them up and work to make the army tear itself apart - perhaps setting up power plays in the enemies armed forces."
loremasters,3c5l1j,HighSalinity,3,Sun Jul 5 00:45:17 2015 UTC,Look at the cleric domains to see if anything is not represented by one of these. Adding a few minor deities to fill in the holes would be good but I think most of what you have covers almost everything you would need. Anything that you find lacking as you play you can take 5 to figure out who should fill that gap.
loremasters,3c5l1j,Gotelc,2,Sun Jul 5 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how you are going to spin the as yet unnamed god of espionage and assassins as Lawful good. Would he be the leader of a sect of Ninja samurai? Even if he is lawful, isn't murder evil? Even if those dudes did need some killin', I would say he is Lawful Neutral at best. Other than that, like /u/Gotelc said take a look at the cleric domains."
loremasters,3c5l1j,dheals,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:18:25 2015 UTC,"It's more of a Michael Westin duty to your country your country type thing. The laws are a code the assassins follow such as who to hit and whatnot. There's no assassinating a benevolent king it anything here. Orcs more like taking out a tyrant or leader of an evil cult.  The lawful part is for those that would otherwise lose their way. Especially active assassins might start to mentally break down, but the lawful part keeps then straight.  Think about those spy movies like Kinsman or RED. Hell, Jack Bauer of 24 works too."
loremasters,3c5l1j,Doom_Lich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:19:32 2015 UTC,"Bauer and ever to some extent Westen are pretty chaotic in some regards, justifying ends by means and kinda going off the deep end.  I picture something more like Thane Krios. A disciplined operative who follows his plans to a T, and prays for forgiveness after each kill. A perfect tool; as he puts it, he's a weapon and an extension of whoever hires him. Where Westen and Bauer might fly off the hinges, Thane refuses to bring himself into the job.   Of course he only takes jobs against the wicked and corrupt, which is where the ""Good"" part comes in. So I image that's what a Lawful Good espionage/assassin god would be; he's craftsman for the perfect disciplined tools of justice. Maybe he's even the one who dictates marks for his faithful; he personally orders kills to maintain the order of the world.   I find that you can twist a lot of different principles of deities to better fit an alignment. A god of death can easily be spun as good if they're a shepherd of lost souls, leading them to the afterlife and watching over their flock. A god of justice can be imagined as a god of vengeance instead, going to any length necessary to bring suffering upon those who they believe have committed atrocities through torture and maiming; we suddenly have a chaotic evil god of justice. It's all in how a god interfaces with their domain."
loremasters,3c5l1j,Doom_Lich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I more than agree that Westen and Bauer are chaotic. Especially Bauer since he straight up ignores orders and does his own thing. I used them as examples to deter away from the ""assassins are evil contract killers"" mindset.  The lawful aspect is a set of rules about who can be assassinated, methods of information gathering, and things of that nature. This god isn't down for gruesome interrogation techniques, even if it means saving a whole city.   He is, however, more about following his set of rules and laws over the governing agency's if there is a conflict."

loremasters,3c1fui,ShiningRayde,7,Sat Jul 4 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"I once (briefly) played in a campaign where this was the central premise. The plot consisted of a series of evil-aligned Gods choosing the PCs in one party as their champions, with the goal to try to conquer the world / galaxy / material plane. The second party's characters were selected by good-aligned Gods to thwart them. The story arcs were built around the two parties trying to muster resources in different regions to compete with one another. As the parties leveled up and their patron deities upped the stakes, this scaled to winning over continents, then whole worlds. Everything was supposed to come to a head in a big, cataclysmic battle between the two player parties, but the campaign died before it made it to this point.  Also worth noting - in this campaign, the evil party was played in-person, but the good party was online. The evil party was aware of the good party's existence, but the good party had no idea that their end-game foes were to be PCs. I suspect this was to prepare the evil party to the possibility that they were going to lose if things boiled down to storytelling tropes."
loremasters,3c1fui,PBandEmbalmingFluid,7,Sat Jul 4 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"Short and sweet; the other party was following a 'devastatingly beautiful woman'.

Cue the two parties joining together, when they realized my character (Also a female) had a higher charisma than the woman they were following. (""She is glaring at you like you just showed up to prom wearing the same dress - but actually making it look good."")

loremasters,3c1fui,Pardum,8,Fri Jul 3 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"From a comment I made a while back:  I once surprised my group of PCs with a PvP ambush. We were towards the end of the session (or so they thought), just about to wrap up the first major plot point. They were at a feast in their honor, when, suddenly, some of our (out-of-character) friends, who also happen to play DnD in a group I DM, showed up with pizza and beer. My players were ecstatic - it had been a long, difficult session for their characters, and people were hungry. One of the players even said ""Oh, good! Now you guys can help us!""  ""You see four shadowy, heavily armed persons enter the hall,"" I narrated. Then, the ""friends"" opened up the pizza and beer boxes to reveal character sheets and dice. I will never forget the looks on my players' faces when I said ""everybody roll initiative."" I had told the pizza-bringing group to roll up some ridiculous evil characters beforehand, and to expect them to be one-shots against the party.  None of the good guys died, but the evil guys put a portable hole into a bag of holding and sucked two of the goodies into the Astral plane. The PCs are currently on a quest to the plane get their comrades back. Should be fun."

Helps for scheduling and when two of my players stopped talking to each other due to rl drama. It's really fun, especially cause some of the groups share the same quest, while others are in a position where they can be working against it.   There's a lot of unknowns between all the parties, and the one or two players that know stuff they shouldn't b/c of their other characters are good about separating the player from the character. I don't do PVP though, especially since some players are clearly more suited for combat than others.   I would recommend having each of the parties be helping NPC'S that are rivals or working towards obtaining the same item/goal. Then when their respective NPC teleports/finances a voyage to the 3rd land, everyone gets to decide which NPC they want to help, if any."

I spend at least a week of every month in Boulder.    I'm currently running an AWESOME Star Wars game that takes place just after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the first Death Star.  I created a small but very rich sector, with detailed information on each star system and important planet and I'm running a group in California playing rebel operatives who have been sent into the sector by General Cracken to try to develop resources (recruits, food, bacta, star ships, money, influence, what ever they can) the Alliance can use and a group in Colorado playing the Imperials who rule the sector and are trying to put the Rebels down.  We've been playing once a month per state since January, so we're just about on turn 7.  A bunch of my friends from Colorado have moved to the Bay Area and others know each other through  Burning Man.  Four of my six CA players are good friends with the folks playing in CO, so there's even a personal rivalry thing going on.  Basically, this is LOTS of fun.  I just created the playground and they mostly react to each other, which is awesome.  I would not have anticipated the crazy twists and turns and schemes they have come up with and the random damage they keep doing to each other.

In this case, the parties combined to fight the big bad at the end of the year and a half campaign.  I really liked combining the campaigns at the end.  I had gods, magical sorcerers, dragons, and armies all fighting.  By bringing the two groups together, it made it feel like a special event, sortof a big party for the last session.  I think the biggest challenge is maintaining consistency between the two campaigns.  Big things happening in one campaign, need to be present in the other.  Having two continents separate for the two campaigns will definitely help.  Maintaining some level parity between the two campaigns will also be key for the crossover."
loremasters,3c1ewo,Ankerholm,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"Why do people keep setting ASOIF RPs after the books, who knows how the world will change.  The wall could fall, the nightswatch could be gone, the Iron throne could be melted down.  You could be a year into your RP and then TWOW comes out and half your setting gets invalidated.    Why not set it in the well established setting between Dunk and egg and the first book?    Just seems crazy to me.  If you're a fan of GRRM why not set it in his setting, and not some speculative fanfiction setting afterward.   edit: If you don't know what I am talking about, check /r/westerosrp"
loremasters,3c1ewo,LemonHerb,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:51:36 2015 UTC,"Since, I've seen two ASoIaF RPs go up in the last couple of days and there have been twice as many comments like this (A good portion by you, I now realize). I'll go ahead and answer this for you.  Yes, setting any game after the current books runs the risk of having their history invalidated by 'cannon.' However, any RP in an established world that sticks religiously to 'cannon' is going to be stiflingly legalistic. People get into RPs for a veriety of reasons, but at their core most are either 1. To tell a cool story, or 2. to live out some sort of fantasy. Neither one can really be fully realized if the communities main concern is strict adherance to a narrow definition of cannon (it's very close to railroading.)  The people who are setting their games in this time frame realize that the books will reveal new and unexpected aspects of GRRM's world, but they don't care. They're telling their own stories and having their own adventures in a world that they collectively agree on. It's important to note that setting the game in a 'Dunk and Egg' setting still has the same problems. If the mods decide to be too legalistic, they can easily deny a wide veriety of cool and interesting stories because they're invalidated by what we know of Westeros' future (as opposed to it's past.) So, for anything fun to happen, there still needs to be a level of flexability and an agreed upon ignoring of cannon.  However, If you really want a Dunk and Egg era RP (which is what I'm gathering from you're repeted posts, assuming you're not just being a troll) I'm sure there is a wide community of people who would love to join you in doing so. Hit up some of the Mods on established RPs, or search around on the rpg subs in general. Try and be a creator, not a complainer. People will thank you for it, and it'll feel a whole lot more rewarding."
loremasters,3c1ewo,RhimeMaster,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"The world of ice and fire really helps fill the gaps and creates a setting that is pretty satisfying.  Between that book, the current books, and dunk and egg you can figure there are major events that are unchangeable and allow RP around it.  It just seems like people who make it after the books just want to have control without people being able to point out where they are definitively wrong.  I am not in favor of Dunk and Egg era, more the era in between or before where there is no established story and likely wont ever be.    You imply that I haven't ""created"" but I am not the type to run forum based RP.  You're just assuming I don't run games that are set in the pre Dunk and Egg setting, or the setting between the books.   Also what's the hate on ""railroading"", it's not a bad thing.  Often the sandbox idea can be code for I am too lazy to write a story, or complete a setting and I want the players to do it for me.  I appreciate a DM who has done the work to create a good story to play within."
loremasters,3c1ewo,LemonHerb,0,Sat Jul 4 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"You're arguments aren't necessarily untrue. However they don't so much counter my statement as they prop up your own argument. If my argument was based on discrediting your opinion, this might be a valid stratagy. However, I was merely explaining why these subs are choosing the era that they are (which is, what you were asking was it not?)    As for implying that you haven't created; yes I suppose I did do that. I assumed that if you had an RP that met your preferences that you would be less likely to attack every post that doesn't match those preferences. For reference; creating does not necesarrily mean leading. It simply means that you use your energy in a positive, colaborative manner instead of the way that you seem to have been using it.  As for railroading. I have nothing against putting in work to write a story. I'm a writer myself, and I think it's an art form that more people should embrace. However, RPGs are not about one person writing a story. They're about multiple people sharing a story. Railroading is a selfish and belittling way to play (and can be done from either end of the 'screen'), it invalidates other players voices.   With that said. You are free to continue to argue, but you'll be arguing at me, not with me. I won't respond further, as I've said my piece.  Edit: Oh, and congratulations on downvoting my comment.

That's generally the sign of the end of any intelligent discussion, way to be above the whole situation.  I don't feel sorry for you though, I don't know you as a person or anything about you.    On the subject of ""railroading"" though it goes both ways, it can be a selfish dm who actually railroads people, or a selfish player who describes it as railroading it because they didn't get their way.    The whole sandbox thing can be the same way, it's a sign of a lazy DM or a DM with an extremely verbose setting who can really handle every contingency a PC can come up with.  I find the former to be true most often though.    The thing is GRRM has actually said he dislikes  fanfiction in the past.   So I find a fanfiction setting based on what people think might happen in his setting pretty lame especially considering there is a wealth of information out there to play within his setting, which is what I imagine a fan of his work would want to do.  It seems lazy to just create something based on his unfinished work, which could be completely invalidated in a year (assuming TWOW is coming out soon, I hope) instead of studying what is there and creating a RP within it.    Since you are done responding to this, good luck on your venture and hopefully you are more receptive to input from your players."

Then, you decision is whether you want one pantheon to cover everything in the world, or different pantheons for different races or different groups of races (given how explicitly you want the gods interfering in the 'natural' world, different pantheons would be rather interesting. Do the laws of physics and the look & behavior of natural phenomena change when you go to different strongholds of divine power?)   The polyhedral approach lets you get a nice spread of all the alignments. You could then choose the rest of the portfolio for each deity randomly. This will give you some counter-intuitive or seemingly absurd choices. Consider using those- half the fun is rationalizing the weird combinations and finding the common thread between them that will give you a deity. Hermes is the god of messengers, thieves, and medicine. You're unlikely to get that sort of combination without some randomness thrown in."

Her holy places are filled with light and warmth. Crafters of all sorts, especially smiths and inventors, can be found working on new devices.  Daily prayers are offered at noon, of course.  Mortal servants of Sjajan are known as Sunlights, both for their association with the sun, and for their often irrepressibly cheerful demeanor.  She is believed to manifest as a female paladin with golden hair and golden armor, or as a work-marked engineer or crafter.  (Three other deities with the Sun domain are -- not surprisingly -- found among the Fire Deities, and Velican, water god of glory, is the fifth deity with the Sun domain.)  The goblin pantheon doesn't have any sun deities (which is odd, since I thought I'd had one attached the the Law domain -- which is also attached to Madness, and it totally makes sense that goblins with the Law and Sun domains are mad).  The Shu-shi pantheon does have deities with the Sun domain. Taiyang is the goddess of the sun (Sun as primary deity), daughter and heir presumptive of Huanghou, empress of heaven.  Taiyang   Domains Sun, Air, Travel, Animal, Weather Alignment Neutral Chosen Weapon Longbow Symbol Golden phoenix   This goddess of the sun is the daughter of Huanghou and heir presumptive. Lovely to look upon, well-mannered, but not yet mature enough to start rising to her inheritance. Qiangda is her mentor and lover, though presumably she will find another to assist when it is time for her to birth her heir.  Her shrines are always in open areas, exposed to sun and wind and weather. They are primarily marked by symbols on the ground rather than actual structures.  Prayers are offered daily at noon, when the sun is highest and brightest.  Her followers are called Guangming, ‘brights’ or ‘lights’. As they grow in service to Taiyang, their skin color, and later hair, lighten toward Taiyang’s golden colors.  Taiyang manifests as a beautiful young Shu-shi with golden hair, skin, and eyes. She has no known less-conspicuous manifestation; her alternate manifestation as a golden phoenix is even more noticeable.  None of the Jixiang Shen (auspicious deities) have the Sun domain. That will change when Taiyang becomes the next empress of heaven, since she has that domain herself, but the entire Court could change. The Jixiang Shen may change membership altogether.  Two of the Bukeishiyi Shen (uncanny deities) have the Sun domain: Liulang Zhe, god of travel, and Fengbao, goddess of weather. The last two deities with the Sun domain are of the Zhengchang Shen: Weifeng, goddess of serendipity and hard work, and Jiachu, god of herders.  ... sorry, big digression there. Point was that you can have multiple deities with the same attributes/domains, even within the same culture, with significantly different characteristics otherwise. You can have 'a sun god', but there's nothing limiting you to that."

loremasters,3bzi13,kjdavies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"Adding to what others have said... The members of your pantheon might not have particular alignments, just affinities (healing, fertility, nature, the sea, etc.). The followers of these deities might have particular alignments, though, and build religions around them. So, Lunoren, goddess of the moon, might be worshipped by Lunorites who focus on the lawful good aspect of time keeping, while the Beholders of the New Moon emphasize the connection of the moon to the flow of blood and thus celebrate lawful evil rites of human sacrifice."
loremasters,3bzi13,hylandw,2,Fri Jul 3 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"I've considered a few variations of this.  In one, all deities were neutral. Churches might follow various aspects of the deity and espouse 'aligned' values (or at least, generally praised/accepted/feared). Most religions following the goddess of farmers are some combination of lawful and good, but there could be a chaotic evil cult that ensures that Her fields are fed with blood to ensure a good harvest.  Erm. Pokonici, LE goddess of Respose, Death, Plant, Madness comes kind of close to this, actually.  Another variation I've considered is that as deities become greater, they become more neutral. It was something along the lines of ""demigods can be any alignment, lesser deities can be any part-neutral alignment, and all intermediate and greater deities must be neutral.  The idea was that at the lower grades the deities might still retain some 'personality', but as they grow into their power and assume more attachment and association with the universe this is gradually consumed. A demigod of magic might still have mortal attachments, a lesser god of magic might find these eroding as he becomes part of the firmament, and an intermediate god is so much a part of his portfolio that he no longer has strong association to a preferred outcome. He is now all things magic, good and bad, and all uses of magic, good and bad."
loremasters,3bzi13,burnerthrown,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"Lemme give it a shot. I'm using key figures of medieval/early civilization life for this.  LG - The Great Shield, Guardian of the Overworld, Protector of Life.  NG - The Lightbringer, Giver of Life, grower of Crops, bringer of Warmth.  CG - The Meddler, Weaver of Plots, Twisting Hand of Fate.  LN - The Scale, Balancer of Fates, Guardian of the Middle World, Protector of Freedom.  TN - The Great Hand, Goals Inscrutable, Ruler of All.  CN - The Shepherd, Reaper of Life, Traveller between Realms.  LE - The Blade, Ruler of the Underworld, Thief of Souls.  NE - The Conqueror, Forever Chained, Destroyer of Life.  CE - The Pestilence, the Wanton Destructor, the Withering Hand.  The three Lawfuls are the protectors of the three realms - the Great Shield is the master of the world above, defending from those who would sink the isles. The Scale rules the surface, keeping demons below and the living above. The Blade lives below, ruler of the hordes, a cruel bargainer of souls.  The neutrals, the three most powerful are the Lightbringer, who is the sun and the heat and the rain, the Great Hand, most powerful and unknown in their will, and the Conqueror, forever chained in the deepest pit of the Underworld to save the realms from his terror.  The chaotes are not so inexorably paired - there's the Meddler, trickster god, who lives to turn fate where it is not expected - putting together lovers, tearing apart business deals, and tricking the gods to save the people of the realms. There's also the Shepherd, who does not meddle in the affairs of the gods, and brings souls to the plane of the Underworld where they belong (or otherwise, if you have a heaven/hell kinda deal). Last is the Pestilence, who reaps flame and destruction when times are good and harvests are full."

loremasters,3brskn,leftfootofjustice,11,Wed Jul 1 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"My fall back for things like that is to find a monster with as many major common traits as you can and reskin it. For example you could take a blue dragon with an acceptable CR. Make him look like a drone now. Now his AC, attacks, and saves are already balanced. Make the breath attack its front machine gun. The gun overheats so it has to cool down to be fired again. If the dragon has spells, pick a few out and make them missles, active camo, armor plating, ect. The melee attacks depend on the flavor of drone you use, either leave them out or turn the damn thing into a transformer that can engage in close combat. The wing attack can be the thrust from the jet engine on it. Hopefully that gets some creative juices flowing. If not find a flying monster close in level to the party and send it to me. I can help you reflavor it."

Give them problems to solve that they have to find narrative ways to stay quiet while overcoming.   Maybe there's a gigantic door they have to get through. Can't really open it without everyone noticing, right? Then it's up to the players to decide if they want to try and put a sleeping potion in the guards' grog supply or if they want to attempt to climb to the ceiling and navigate steam-vents which could lead them in the wrong direction.  Maybe they can lure some creatures/guards/whatever out from their posts, but there is a watchdog left behind. They have to rig a way to distract/silence the dog without making it bark (which would bring the guards running back), but luckily the store room is open!  etc etc."

No boring chain of stealth check, stealth check, stealth check.   I'm not sure I would just do that straight up. I would do a ""stealth prep"" and have the stealthiest character make a stealth role vs. a general guard perception. Then provide the amount they beat it by as a general bonus to stealth during the heist (ie. the sneak went through the entire party and made sure they were wearing quiet shoes and didn't have anything dangling that would make noise, etc). Now, assume that anytime that bonus is enough to succeed a stealth check, just announce ""you're quiet enough"". This way you still get to roll stealth checks at the points where it's very important, (roll stealth to see if you can quietly open this large stone door).   But, other ways to preserve the suspense is to act it out. The GM should whisper and ""act stealthy"". If any of the players do anything loudly, make them roll stealth on the spot. Keep it in the players heads that their characters are being stealthy. Occasionally make them roll perceptions to hear insignificant, but very quiet noises. Maybe the guards hear it too!"

Even if failing the prep doesn't flat out alert all guards, it's still a big risk for turning an otherwise interesting environment into a grueling slog. Too many times have my players failed rolls that should have been cakewalks and then I have to improvise a complete change in the scene.  Your second idea is much better. It enforces some RP at the table (which a lot of groups struggle with, if posts on this sub are any indication) but in a way that everyone can easily partake. Even if it doesn't have much mechanical threat, it could convey the urgency better than any rolls can."

You want the ninjas to get caught because they made a bad call, not because the dice said ""you get caught now"". The players don't decide to roll low, thus their mission success should not depend on a toss of the dice.  All that said, the end result is the players should be able to do a rather wide variety of maneuvers without rolling stealth checks. Scouting, repositioning, setting traps... these should all be automatically ""quiet enough."" If they try to just slip past a guard without distracting him first, or wall-crawl past some dogs and just hope they don't get sniffed out, or whatever, then tell them it'll be a stealth check and let them back out or press on.

This allows you to take the ""let it ride"" approach, which I first encountered in the Burning Wheel system - roll once, and let that roll determine the results for more than just 1 check.  Stealth rolls are still worth making, but at specific, tension-building moments: there is broken glass on the floor - is everyone in the party willing to risk passing through it? There is a way around it, but it might fall directly in nearby guard's line of sight, or be clearly trapped to set off an alarm, etc. Making new checks can build tension, but it only needs to be done at critical points."

Think of the converse, it's a Fencing/Archery Competition, you wouldn't just have the Wizard auto hit with his rapier as long as he stays in character?   Far better, would be for guards to start out bored and totally distracted, and multiple failure would cause them to slowly raise alertness levels. 1) Looking for a bit then moving on 2) Asking other guards if they saw anything 3) Walking over and getting a closer look 4) Sounding the alarm..."

When I say ""no reason to be stealth,"" I mean allowing the tank with no stealth to just follow behind the rogue, undetected until he leaves the shadows/takes an action is a huge disruption to the system. It alters the player calculus that 1) there is no longer a reason for everyone to take a few points in Stealth just for this instance. 2) Character's should min max even more than normal. Why take up support skills or build a well rounded character if you know the DM will rule fiat you able to do any essential task, even though you focused all your attention on...Well probably combat."

loremasters,3bltql,spookyjeff,2,Tue Jun 30 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Obviously this would be a one-time thing. You wouldn't make it a core part of a campaign without warning the players so they can make their characters accordingly.  Even within such a paradigm, you wouldn't completely remove the stealth skill from all rolls, you would just assume that the basic ""being sneaky"" rolls all succeed. If part of a solution to a problem was to garrote a guard from behind, you'd probably still make the attacker roll stealth. But even then, you could continue the ""assume competence"" theme and have them roll stealth but not bother with an attack roll.  As with any RPG suggestion, people have to addapt it to their group. If your rogue is a pouty whiner, you're going to have trouble with this. But if you players who like a change of pace and an opportunity to look at a problem from a new direction, something along these lines might be a great fit."

At night there are guards patrolling around and we looked at a plan to subdue each guard seperately so we wouldn't have to take on the entire bunch together.   We ultimately didn't go for this, the chances for us to silence a guard in a single round was too unreliable and when things go bad, they'd go REALLY bad.   Instead we managed to trick the guards into letting us enter the ship with a ""prisoner"" and then had to fight/bribe our way out once we got our intel.  There are 2 main problems here.    Guards are very difficult to subdue, preventing them from raising an alarm simply by calling out is almost impossible (without magic) When things go bad, they go really bad and you tend to not be able to go back to a safe place and try again.   So how could you fix this?   Make your guards very easy to kill in a single hit but give them very high damage output (flavor this however you want) Guards are endless, fighting them will result in getting overrun.  Give them a reset option. Either a special magic that resets the entire night or a few places where it's easy to hide until the guards go back on patrols.. (items like tanglefoot bags, caltrops and the grease spell... will all be very welcome to lose your pursuers)  Intel, make it so they can plan, follow guards around, scry the next room (maybe an item that gives them a power from the Exploration Cleric Domain Don't be afraid to make it a bit gamey if that's what it takes.

One thing I try and work on is making sure everyone is incorporated. Rather than just have the stealth-spec rogue be the only one that heads into the museum, the group tailors the party going in to the situation. I also try and make sure that everyone has (or at very least feels like they have) some level of control and effect over the events unfolding, even if from outside of the immediate action.  Having recurring characters also helps some, so rather than many smaller/weaker patrols, have one or two of tougher enemies the group has to fight or evade. The addition of non-NPC obstacles like some kind of security system also adds a little bit of a different fluff to the heist."
loremasters,3bltql,teufer,2,Tue Jun 30 07:22:02 2015 UTC,"As a player I managed to turn almost every quest my old bard was involved in to some kind of heist, so maybe I can give you a bunch of ideas for the ""heist mindset"" your players will need.  First thing, we gather intel. Every kind of intel, because you can't know what is useful. My DM hated this part, because we forced him to produce intel on things he never thought could have any influence on the quest. I suggest you to give them a lot of information, even the useless bits, just to plant the idea that information will be a key to the success.  Second thing is, they don't really need the whole party inside, yet the whole party will be needed to the heist. When we stopped playing (I assume we will resume the campaign one day or the other) we were doing a really big and nasty thing to the weapons of a whole city. At this moment, in game, our infiltration team is doing the stealth part, our barbarian is in a tavern being as loud as possible, so whoever is following us ""knows"" were we are and, last but not least, we have a paladin outside the city walls with a ready carriage. Not everybody can do stealth but a good job needs everybody to be done properly.  Third thing: it doesn't start when they enter the dungeon. Roleplaying the planning is going to be fun, so make sure they do it. Also, preparations have to be made before entering and they are a focal part of a good heist (send the bard in to the slums to whip up general bad attitude to outright rebellion, so the Guard's attention will be elsewhere and the party can have better chances to stab the Evil King or simple acts of sabotage to slow down the guards or stash some supply somewhere useful...)"
loremasters,3bltql,pensee_idee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:09:23 2015 UTC,"I would echo what another commenter has said, which is that it will probably be more fun and interesting if they get noticed by the guards for doing something that makes noise (which is something they can control) than if they get noticed for failing a skill check (which is something that's basically out of the players' control.)  First of all, beyond the tedium of rolling the dice every turn to see if they successfully snuck or not, the more times you have them roll the dice, the more likely they are to fail.  (Even if they only fail on a natural 1, for example, a party of 4 players has a 20% chance of one of them blowing it on the very first turn, and the odds of never missing a single roll go down from there.)  That approach could also lead them to not think much about any other aspect of the way they interact with their environment.  Why worry about using strategy to avoid noisy situations when you're likely to have your cover blown just for walking down the hallway, no matter what else you do?  The second reason I'd recommend this is that giving your players meaningful choices about how to stay quiet, and when to take chances gives them some control of the situation.  Fast and risky vs. slow and safe is a classic dilemma, especially if there's also some danger in taking too long.  The time to roll for stealth, in my opinion, is when they're doing something that could attract attention but might not, or right when they encounter a guard to see if they can slip away without being noticed.  That way, by the time they're making the skill check, they've already made a conscious decision to take a chance and roll the dice.  If they fail the check and the guards come, it's because of something they chose, something they did that they could have done differently, not just because they entered the dungeon at all and then got ground down by an inexorable series of skill checks."
loremasters,3bltql,killergazebo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"I'm planning a heist adventure right now, and I've realized that the best heist stories involve more than just being sneaky.

loremasters,3bltql,hopeful_nihilist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"So, as you have already realized, you need to build a campaign, or series of mini missions, to go beyond stealth checks, pick lock, alarm, speed fight/retreat.  Step #1) Encourage planning: Subtle method, have an NPC layout the first few hints. Have them stumble across an old thief who almost got away with it, but didn't see X coming. Railroad method (we all deal with these parties), have the thief guild hire them to only do X, then when key guild members get arrested/killed, they need to take over--without knowing what the full plan was. This should get them in the pre plan/prep mindset.  Warning, don't have a NCP hire them with a full/near full playbook, or preset plan. Having an NCP, telling them, go check out the Chef, he can be bribed, will take away the only part of this that is fun, them being creative.  Step # Two: Recon: You need to give the players lots of information, so they can plan. This is the time for the face to shine. Your players need maps and knowledge of what security is present so they can make a plan. Ideas: City planning office keeps records/architect just rebuilt a room/former fired staff/failed thief in jail/for hire wizard can scry/drunk guards with loose lips/corrupt noble just visited. You need at least 3 sources of information--or it will feel like a railroad and they will take the information as a cue from you to blindly follow the lead--NPC X sent us down path Y. Make the information from each source partial and slightly contradictory. This will add some doubt to you players, and force them to get creative. If you are lucky, they will come up with a way to double check the information, enhancing RPing. Or, at least debate what is more likely true.  Warning: Make Sure Recon is either totally off site, or if on site, protected and very limited. Players will be itching to just go for it. You don't want the recon to be stealth at the target. They'll end up past the point of no return, and just try to finish the thing blind.  Step #3 The Plan: The target needs a minimum of two layers of security, that the players discover. One, layer should be all but certain to discover them. The second layer, should be fairly easy to sneak through. The most simple design is Guards on patrol with low alertness, but a roving Special Guard outclasses them. The Special needs a weakness or method to avoid. Hence the natural plan is disable/avoid X. (Ideas for a special: Wizard Scryer/Former Pickpocket Turned Captain/Custom Golem with Blind Sight/Trainer with a Hell-hound/Live in Boyfriend with a Robe of Eyes/Doors with Alarm Spells/Anti magic room with hunting dogs//Master Wizard Locksmith/whatever). Plans get more fun with multiple specials/tradeoffs/areas of impossibility--we have to avoid X at all cost.  Pro Tip: I have had excellent luck, building a Special, I myself don't know how to avoid/get around. Not that it has no weakness or is everywhere at once, but I honestly feel stumped by it. My players usually will come up with a great plan after long debate. Sometimes, they will say something like, ""I wounder if it has flaw X?"" I will then sometimes build that flaw into the mission post, so they feel like they discovered it rather than invented it.  General Criticisms With Heist Missions: All these missions suffer from two problems. #1 WTF do your unskilled do. You really cant have a fighter creeping behind the rogue, you end up being hamstrung by the weakest sneak. #2 Split the Party Much? These missions are massive split the party. You can easily end up with Change Person Wizard on the Inside, Fighter/Bard across town holding a drinking contest with half the guards, Rogue sneaking down the hall, Priest/Enchanter at the moat house casting hold on the guard with the see invis goggles, Druid in Animal Form Scouting the walls. For a heist movie/trope/planning/RPing this is perfect, but for game play, only the most dedicated players won't fall asleep.  Ideas to keep the party together: Easiest, special shrinking potions that last hours, and the drinker can end. Warn the rogue, if you drink it, at diminutive size you will spend hours walking through/unable to pick locks. The buffoons can hitch a ride in his pocket, and calculate if it's worth it to bounce out. Items of invis and stealth bonus can also work, but you will need a reason to bring the buffoons along, or the rogue will just use them.   Finally: Think of ways for non skilled to contribute. The Inside Job is 1/2 Orc only, the Carpenter's a 1/2 Orc and is looking for a 1/2 orc assistant. Temple X cast the defensive spells, they are hiring someone to review/recommend improvements, Knowledge Religion/Spell Craft is key to gain access, not disguise or bluff. Enchanter is selling Key Item of X, but its Race/Class restricted.   Warning, avoid unmovable guard at endpoint, needed to KO fast. This is not in the Heist Trope, and will turn this into a standard mission. You want incentives to do the whole thing stealthy without combat. The last thing you want is plan: we cast silence and proceed to area wipe, room by room."
loremasters,3bltql,zyjux,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of only making them roll stealth when they're in a situation where they're choosing to potentially expose themselves. My suggestion would be to have three levels of awareness for the guards: safe, curious, and searching. If a character fails a stealth check vs. a guard on ""safe"", they just provoke them into curious, unless they crit fail. A curious guard goes and investigates wherever the disturbance came from, but hasn't drawn his weapon and can still be surprised. However, if they see you and you fail a second stealth check, then the gig is up and it's time to roll initiative.   The ""alarmed"" state is triggered if you leave behind too much evidence. If a body is found, or for whatever reason the guards know that their security is compromised, they always have their weapons out, and it only takes a single failed stealth check to trigger initiative. This really incentives the characters to be careful, to sneak past rather than just leaving a trail of bodies, and can be used to add extra tension to getting out again after the heist.   I like the idea of low-health guards, and you could consider either letting characters automatically insta-kill if they make their attack roll when striking from stealth with surprise. Otherwise, perhaps consider giving all characters on the run some sort of temporary boost that gives them sneak attack damage and the assassin archetype ability from 5e that makes any attack from stealth an automatic critical hit.   Edit: And for a great example of this, check out episode 3 of Critical Role on Geek and Sundry. It's a great RPG show (voice actors playing D&D leads to massive hilarity), and in that episode they plan and execute a stealth raid on a Duergar encampment led by a mind-flayer. They know the mind-flayer will be a terrible opponent if it becomes aware of them, so their focus is on getting to it and neutralizing it before it can become a threat.   EditEdit: Another idea I just had would be to simply allow the characters to take 10 on their stealth checks for moving through corridors and for situations where they're not specifically exposing themselves, and use their result there to let them know how close they can get to a guard before triggering a rolled check. So it still lets the rogue with a ton of stealth be better at this run than the paladin, but still keeps it more predictable and in the control of the players."
loremasters,3bltql,Iwantmyfuckingcrane,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've run a heist and my players seemed to enjoy it. I did it through the old 'Rule of Three'. For murder mysteries and other combat-lite situations where the party must decipher information its a good idea to give three options. So I just gave a bunch of different options for the players for the majority of situations. For example the target was surrounded by tall buildings, had poorly guarded front gates and an extensive sewer network beneath it. That leaves three possible methods of entry that favour either stealth (coming in from above), charisma (charming their way through the main gate) or strength (climbing up pipes). I then did this for the majority of the session. Its a lot of planning work but it seemed to pay off.   I also gave the players time for an Ocean's Eleven style planning montage. So when it came to the plan a lot of the tension came from their own desire to see the plan succeed. Also creating variety gives the plan a lot of moving parts and makes it seem really intricate, with the added benefit of giving everyone something to do rather than just the rogue. I'm not sure if this could be applied to an entire dungeon but I guess I know that it is technically possible."
loremasters,3bltql,spudpuffin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Assuming this isn't a party of rouges where it isn't that bad.    Disconnect the sound, guards can't shout to other rooms immediately. They'd have to take their actions to perhaps open a nearby door, or find the alarm ~40ft away. Otherwise, it's save or have all the enemies attack en masse.  Give your players choices of approach, make a flow chart of options starting outside the dungeon that lead toward success, then make those choices a reality. Can you sneak into the courtyard of a walled castle by climbing in through the sewers, or bribe a guard at a tavern to open the porticullus to you. Make the choices matter on the little things, especially when creativity is used. Traps, dungeons are great for traps, but stealth dungeons add a layer of complexity to each one. If the arrow trap down the hall was triggered, the guard will probably investigate that sound. Or if someone falls into a spike pit trap while sneaking around the back rooms without seeing the kill-switch. Do his cries of pain and anguish alert the guard, or does the smell of blood set off an animal.  Have fun with it, and probably give the players a chance to sabotage, if they do it and then are detected, then the fallout might not be so bad if they are discovered.  Alternate objectives, so if you have a 6'5"" Paladin in full plate, he's probably not going to be able to sneak through with the party, but what someone could do is cast a mental link on him, have him get captured and thrown in the dungeons and from there he can send back info to the party about the layout/weaknesses. The clumbsy bard could bluff his way into  the night's feast and charm the lord of the (dungeon) into an easy sleep, thus obtaining every key and password, before his friends bust in to help him. Think about the characters and their motivations, and you can usually give them something constructive during a heist, distractions and sniping galore!   Hope this was useful, just saw this thread and it gave me a lot of ideas."

loremasters,3bkx62,reggie991,2,Tue Jun 30 04:55:50 2015 UTC,The most dramatic would be a dragon. Young all the way to Ancient. But make sure to have other big baddies so if the players take out a young dragon then go back to their present where the dragon should have been an adult have a tribe of Minotaur or a powerful undead now control the dungeon.  It has been my experience that if you make the party decisions have  consequences it makes the the experience feel more real. Even to the point where magic items disappear from their packs or person and are either just gone or maybe replaced with a different item (I.E. they lose the nice long sword they had gotten but its replaced with a battle axe with different properties because where they fought the Human skeletons with soldier type weapons they maybe would have fought Dwarven zombies).

loremasters,3bkx62,TSED,2,Tue Jun 30 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"Take a note from World of Warcraft on this one.  Disclaimer: I quit WoW back in February, so if there has been any substantial lore alterations/additions since then I hold myself absolved.  While we could go on for days about the Caverns of Time and how they allow the player to experience pivotal moments in history, let's instead look at End Time (if I remember the name correctly).  Norzdormu, the Bronze Dragon of Time (meaning he has the best time-related abilities and his lesser drakes have similar, lesser abilities) was shown his own demise by the powers that be. So, there exists a... to borrow a term from Dr. Who... ""timey-whimey"" version of Norzdormu that used his powers to alter time and in some instances even time travel to kill off or save certain individuals so as to save himself. This led to some predictably bad circumstances and caused this version of the Dragon to turn corrupted, twisted, and mad, further playing at his own power much to the stress of the player- whose various dungeons are attempts to block or clean up this dragon's messes.  What can your game make of this? In all those dungeons I mentioned future-crazy Norzdormu, renaming himself Murozond because tropes, his corruption causes a similar change in his drakes and they dub themselves the ""Infinite dragonflight"" or ""time-travelling and meddling evil dragons"" who are invariably assigned the villain role.  The theme looks something like this: current time's bronze dragon and fellow drakes are always monitoring the time waves and send powerful heroes to intervene anytime a ripple in time is detected. Because the villain behind these plans is the future-crazy version of the present-good bronze, there is a battle against himself at play with time and history the battleground.  To make this your own, you could replace the dragon/drake creature type with something else. Doppelgangers, changelings, polymorphic oozes, or my personal favorite from the still-terrible 4e Tomb of Horrors- time-lost angels."

loremasters,3bi5s1,Maijx,6,Mon Jun 29 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"Tyr's church has a pretty weird relationship to law. Are they embedded into the legal systems in civilized countries and city states, or do they make the laws. What do they do if rulers make bad laws. Do they mix and match, or do they only adhere to their own laws?   This is exactly the sort of thing that I love. How I would take it is that there's not really one answer; there are disagreements within  the church about how best to serve Tyr.  Certain factions think that their role is to sit next to the rulers and advise them on legal matters (sometimes even drafting the laws themselves), while other factions think this is totally and completely wrong and that the first faction is trying to get a seat at the table for kickbacks, or worse, trying to seize power from the rightful rulers. And the first faction think that the second faction is morally lazy and doesn't want to be responsible for the laws that they're upholding, because it's easier not to think for once in your life you cretin.  So if a cleric gets sent on a quest, it might bring him to a choice between these two factions who both dislike each other, but are also both composed of his superiors. They're all colleagues and coworkers, and any quest is the potential for dread politics (with all the fallout naturally associated with being seen making a choice).  If you want flavorful non-quest things to do (which you could easily hook into a quest):   Helping the sick; spending some time in the hospitals tending to the wounded, expending some cure spells, etc. Bonus points if these wounded have wounds that match Tyr's. Providing legal assistance; depending on the legal structure in question, maybe there's some form of public defender, or at least the opportunity for a cleric to argue on behalf of someone who wouldn't be able to effectively defend themselves. Collecting tithes; anyone can pay money to the church, that's easy. Less easy is going door-to-door collecting money, especially if someone comes up light. It might seem like barely a step up from begging, but the church has need of funds."

loremasters,3bi5s1,Bearded_heathen133,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the legal system in this day and age is largely feudal and subject to the will of the governor; even in places where the laws are carefully codified (which is uncommon), individual magistrates have a great deal of flexibility in administering justice. In the eyes of the church of Tyr (which is Lawful and not Good), a ""bad"" law is one that undermines orderly societal function. Harsh taxes, controlled speech, marriage constraints, and restricted movement are all orderly. Tyr's church might encounter friction with local government when there are laws that release certain privileged parties from contractual obligations, and they might take issue with some lay magistrates' applications of justice. Because of this, only in the most tyrannical of areas (where a despot regularly flouts justice) is the church anything but a loyal (if activist) member of society.  Tyr is the god of Law and Justice, and as such in some areas his clergy may function as an affiliate of law enforcement, and possibly be entrusted with the adjudication of disputes that would otherwise go to the Lord of the land. In this case a non-insignificant portion of the temple may be dedicated to serve as a small claims court (and affiliated clerics who happen to be available may be called upon to assist in the court's activities as bailiffs, court agents to serve documents or obtain witnesses, judges, or to cast spells to detect lies in important cases). For this you may have a waiting area (with clerical workers to organize the queue) adjoining a court room which has enough furniture to accommodate the judge and the court recordkeeper, but probably little else (as supplicants would likely stand).  Of course, all temples serve as a focal point for worship, which in the Forgotten Realms setting is largely personal and informal rather than organized (i.e. individuals stopping by when they can to offer prayers and make donations). The main worship area may be a quiet space with various shrines- statuettes, inspirational artwork, tomes, and the like- around the perimeter, possibly with padding or sparse furniture to make kneeling (but not sitting) more comfortable for the wealthy or infirm. Priests are not likely to attend this area, as supplicants are funneled through the queue to the court- even if they are requesting healing and the like, it's a court case (there's just no wrongdoing to address).  I imagine that with the large number of court cases that are recorded in these temples, they will also require an archive and archivist, which combine with Tyr's affinity for Knowledge to make them natural places for libraries, which would likely be connected but partially separate institutions with special areas for court records."
loremasters,3bi5s1,DeRickulous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"I believe Tyr's base on law is that law is just not by being law, but that law is just by reason, fairness, and logic.   Adhering to rhetoric is not of justice. So, I would say don't worry about the concerns of part 2 and instead work to make the character abide by an idea of what law means to him and the Church that he follows. The biggest ideology that should play a role in this is a militant utilitarianism. (meaning to say that they will exact justice on those who actively do not prescribe to this belief).   If you're looking for resources on RL content to refer to I would suggest maybe looking into how Pope Urban II rallied the first crusaders (along with the chivalric knights that ventured forth and how it changed their form). For more fantasy based flavor just work towards something that resembles Warcraft's Order of the Silver Hand, if you're having trouble.   The righteous do not push their will onto others who are righteous.  The righteous punish those who attempt to break that rule. The righteous are pious to Tyr and embody attributes of divinity and justice: selfless, logical, fair, judicial, courageous, strong, wrathful. (Fearless might be better than courage; it's more their style)   Hope to have helped. I'm willing to talk and flesh things out more if you'd like."

loremasters,3bcy2z,Meistermalkav,5,Sun Jun 28 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"Alright... I can help you with the price, at least, and I'll talk you through the process I used to determine all of this, thanks to the wonderful chart that I have abused heavily over the years.  For magic items with multiple effects, you start with the most expensive one, then add the others at 150% of their cost. Going by the list, it sounds like the Handy Haversack portion would be the priciest, so we'll start with that as a base price.  The Handy Haversack is a 2000gp item; this comes from the basic price of a Secret Chest spell (Despite being a 5th level spell, they seem to treat the effect as a 1st level spell for cost, since it's significantly less powerful than the actual spell, so 2000gp for an unlimited use item), doubled because it's slotless, then halved because it has a duration of longer then 24 hours. Since we're actually making it into equipment, we set the base price of the item at 1000gp, since we skip the 'double it' portion.  Next, we want to add Endure Elements to the item. This is a 1st level spell, with a duration of 24 hours or longer, so it costs 1000gp as an item. Since we are combining effects, the price increases by 50%, making our item currently worth 2500gp.  Ant Haul only has a duration of 2 hours/level, so technically, it should be the most expensive portion of the item, at 2000gp, base, so ignore most of what I just said above; the previous two effects would be added onto the Ant Haul item, at 1500gp each, making the item currently worth 5000gp.  Light and Prestidigitation are 0-level spells, so they're 1/2 as expensive as 1st level spells. Light has a duration of 10 min/level, so it gets a 1.5x multiplier on its cost (spell level x CL x 2000 x duration modifier is 1/2 x 1 x 2000 x 3/2 = 1500) while Prestidigitation is a 1-hour duration, and receives no multiplier, and costs 1000. These are both then increased by 50%, to 2250 and 1500, and added to our item, for a total cost of 8750gp.  However, we're adding specific restrictions to the item, which help to mitigate its cost! For this, we need to look under Cursed items, to add the requirements of 'Must possess class feature (rage powers)' and 'Must speak Shoanti'. Sadly, cursed items do not have specific price modifiers, and are mostly subject to DM interpretation, but I would reduce the price by no more than 10-25%; 7500gp sounds like a good, ballpark estimate for what I would pay for this very effective utility item.  Crafting it would then require all of the spells listed (Secret Chest, Ant Haul, Endure Elements, Light, and Prestidigitation), would likely set the CL at 9 (minimum to learn Secret Chest, just like the Handy Haversack), it would cost 1/2 the market price in materials (3750), and would require the Craft Wondrous Item feat. I'd possibly add that the crafter must meet the requirements the item imposes, as well.  TL;DR: 7500gp"

Incredibly good and essentially an extremely well thought out version of this.   EDIT: Oh hey look what I found (not pirated posted by audio book company)
loremasters,3b5b33,TIDOUBLEGUHER,3,Fri Jun 26 12:09:47 2015 UTC,"This. So much this.  For /u/anubis647: 60% of magic ""wizards"" cast is about summoning spirits (""demons"", except they don't like that name) and 40% is casting punishments on bound spirits.  Simplest ""contract"" would be: draw appropriate pentacles, use appropriate herbs, speak proper incantations, which summons a spirit. If you did something wrong, you will be devoured whole, and the spirit will return to its home. Then you give it a task (extra-dry legalese), which the spirit will fulfill begrudgingly fulfill while trying to be as maleficent as possible, and trying to kill you in the process. After the task is finished, you disband the spirit.  Spirits don't like to serve, especially since wizards use punishments to get their point across.  In a couple of places, it is mentioned that a wizard cast a spell. One example would be a spell that turned a man into a statue of solid metal. What actually happened was that the wizard ordered a spirit at his disposal to transmute a man into scrap metal. :)  Also, it's technically called ""Bartimaeus Sequence"" and here is a nice animation which shows some powers of spirits. Great series, loved the wit. :)  EDIT: Also, ""enchanting"" was little more than binding a spirit into an item. To create a grenade-like weapon, bind four elementals (fire, water, earth, air) in a glass ball. To create a stereotypical wizard's staff, bind them in a gem in the head of the staff. Magic helmet? Bind spirits in the helmet. And so on, and so forth."
loremasters,3b5b33,Barimen,5,Fri Jun 26 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"This is a very cool idea, perhaps have the entity's enchant items with powers so that the characters can cast more  readily during combat. Also if you're going down that route I'd include demons/Devils etc that can curse enemies or grant exceptional power, but at a steep cost.   I'd also make the things the entities ask for generate adventure from time to time e.g. The sacred Grove has been desecrated, you need to restore it."
loremasters,3b5b33,NoChurch,2,Fri Jun 26 11:50:14 2015 UTC,I like the idea of sidequests based on living up to your deals--this could really open some doors for different scenarios and be a good offshoot from the main storyline! Demons will definitively be involved if the players so choose. Maybe even some named ones like old Mephistopheles himself.
loremasters,3b5b33,auner01,5,Fri Jun 26 16:00:34 2015 UTC,Wasn't Deadlands magic based on something similar?
loremasters,3b5b33,workingboy,3,Fri Jun 26 16:02:01 2015 UTC,I came here to say this. Yes. Hucksters in Deadlands would bargain with manitous to gain their magical power--represented by playing poker.
loremasters,3b5b33,cromlyngames,2,Fri Jun 26 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"There's a few easy ways to develop this. One is that summoned creatures may have links to 2 or so catergories - eg a curses/knowedge spider demon, or a healing/creatures to fight alongside you - elemental avatar of a cherubim  Creatures may vary with geography - the same ritual in the desert and the rainforest should get you a different elemental, but could it get you a different sort of Fae?  Creatures may vary by organisation - eg a confedaration of spirits will share infomation on deals so you can build trust with all of them when dealing with one. Summoning a loner might be better if you don't want to affect other realtionships on a dodgy request.  Creatures might vary by their risk/reward ratio or by wheter they demand payment up front vs a long term payoff.  5 caterogies x 5 possible secondry characteristics x 6 major enviroments x 3 levels of risk/reward x 2 (organized or not) gives you 900 possible creatures classes :)"
loremasters,3b5b33,Barimen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:24:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is a good point. By changing the attributes or traits of these summons depending on certain criteria, it would really keep it from getting stale or same-y. I'm planning on an urban fantasy setting... maybe different parts of the city yield different types of summons?"
loremasters,3b5b33,erosPhoenix,2,Fri Jun 26 15:58:32 2015 UTC,"Only if you summon a creature, not if you try to summon a specific creature. Getting a random creature every time would kinda suck... Hrm... Creatures of a certain type could be naturally drawn to areas populated by people of a certain type. For example, in an area infested with gangs (chaotic evil; ""rule of the strongest, trampling everyone weaker"") it could be easier to summon a spider-demon, as their kind is just like that. Trying to summon an angel, even if it's a very specific angel that really likes you, could instead summon a spider-demon.  Might want to make a table or two for those rules.   Also, it would really suck if you tried to summon an Imp and get a Marid capable of turning your eyes into flower bouqets by raising an eyebrow, but would lead to funny stories deaths. :P"
loremasters,3b5b33,93calcetines,2,Fri Jun 26 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"Another option for handling situations where characters need quick access to magic (like during combat) is that in addition to summoning a creature and haggling every time you need something, some people form an ongoing contract with an entity, where they gain a fraction of that entity's power for as long as the contract lasts (in exchange for something hefty and ongoing.) Or they have the summoned entity fight for them. Or this is just a system that de-emphasizes combat.  I think it would be really interesting if some characters have preferred entities that they know and regularly interact with, like Harry Dresden and what's-his-face."
loremasters,3b5b33,Magester,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"These an excellent ideas--it was a bit of an oversight on my part to not think of an option where the player could make a long-term agreement so that they don't have to go through the summoning ritual every time.

loremasters,3b5b33,Barimen,2,Fri Jun 26 13:41:32 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Reminds me of hucksters in deadlands. Every time you cast a spell you have to play a hand of cards with the devil.

loremasters,3b5b33,NoChurch,2,Fri Jun 26 19:21:23 2015 UTC,Same reason I've always liked the way some RPGs handle prophetic visions/dreams. I'm gonna tell you what's going to happen later in the plot but everything's going to be masked in metaphor. If you as a player can realize what those metaphors represent you'll get a huge insight as to what's happening or going to happen. Sometimes you don't catch it till it's too late and then it seems so clear.
loremasters,3b5b33,Barimen,2,Fri Jun 26 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"Here's a suggestion regarding your categories.  Five realms of spirits:   Heaven - Angels Elysium - Fae Four Realms - Elementals The Abyss - Demons Hell - Spirits   You can arrange that in a nice X-shaped map, with Elementals being at the center. (Combine it with my other suggestion regarding specialization through choice.)  Alternatively, nine realms:   Heaven - Angels Nirvana - [Agathions] Elysium - Fae Utopia - Spirits [Inevitables] Four Realms - Elementals Limbo - [Proteans] Hell - [Devils] Abaddon - [Daemons] Abyss - Demons   (I took the liberty of adding some names from links enclosed below to that list.) Make a three-by-three square. Fill in the names of realms from top to bottom and from left to right. Again, combining this ""map"" with specialization-through-choice, and what I suggested above...   If you work mostly with Angels, you will also get on the good side of Agathions and Spirits, but Demons will hate your guts. If you work with Proteans, Fae and Demons will like you a bit more. Elementals... For the sake of simplicity, let's say they are a world of their own and work with whoever summons them. :)  Although, you could try to summon an Elemental, and always get an Air elemental because you are good with Angels. Something like that. Or if you summon an earth Elemental, that will piss off air Elementals, but also kinda-please water Elementals - Water/Earth and Air/Fire are kinda similar, aren't they?    Credit where it's due: I lifted the names from here and here. The Keep is a nod to the Keep of the Four Worlds from Chronicles of Amber, and a pun on Far Realm. x)"

loremasters,3b3wu6,Dragodar,3,Thu Jun 25 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"Is the wizard evil or just unaware that the prince was kidnapped? Maybe the prince he bought was enchanted to look like a magical animal of some sort and the wizard becomes furious once he finds out that A: He accidentally facilitated a kidnapping and B: He can't get the magical ingredients he needs for his spells since the creature isn't actually magical in origin.  So he could offer the party a deal. Since he is an absent-minded wizard who has a billion trillion ongoing projects he's completely forgotten which animal he actually purchased from the witch. He did write down a memo on what it was but, being careful about spies, he wrote it down in the form of a riddle. Only, he's forgotten the answer.  So if the party can help him figure out which animal the prince was turned into he can reverse the spell. He might also potentially become a powerful ally to the party in the long run since he was double-crossed by the witch and obviously wants to get his share of the trade back from her.  As for the riddle, how about something to the tune of ""Claws of iron, armored skin. When I exhale I burn everything"" or, if you want something a bit harder, ""A mantle of flames and feathers for skin. Where my life ends it also begins""  Answers obviously being uoƃɐɹp ɐ and xᴉuǝoɥd ɐ.  Edit:  Alternatively you could have the wizard ask the party to retrieve some bauble of his (possibly what he needs to return the prince to them) that got stolen by a pesky rat that lives in his home. He offers to transform the party into mice (everything stays the same stat-wise but they are now tiny) so that they can enter the mousehole and get back his [insert magic bauble here].

During this time of contract the First Party is bound to, but not limited to: * The First Party will never intentionally cause harm to the second party, through inaction or otherwise. * The First Party will reveal any relevant information to the second party upon specific request. * The First Party will never intentionally cause harm to the second party pet, familiar, or similar being through inaction or otherwise. * The First Party will never intentionally mislead the second party in an affront to bring harm to the second party or his reputation.  If, at any time during this contract, the above conditions are not met or if they are purposefully broken, the contract and all bindings within are immediately terminated.  During this time of contract the Second Party is bound to, but not limited to: * The Second Party will never intentionally cause harm to the second party, through inaction or otherwise. * The Second Party will reveal any relevant information to the second party upon specific request. * The Second Party will never intentionally cause harm to the second party pet, familiar, or similar being through inaction or otherwise. * The Second Party will never intentionally mislead the second party in an affront to bring harm to the second party or his reputation.  If, at any time during this contract, the above conditions are not met or if they are purposefully broken, the contract and all bindings within are immediately terminated.  The penalty for violently breaking the bindings of the contract between one party to another is an immediate termination of the pact in a likewise violent manner.  An unauthorized, unprovoked, or intentional attack between parties will result in repercussions, up to, but not limited to: * The skies tearing asunder, unholy or holy lightning striking the offending party thrice. * Immobility for two full rounds. * Immediate dismissal of any and all controlled beings.  At any time during the term of service of this contract, either party may at such time modify the conditions in a way that is agreeable to both parties.  Any discussion of this contract and its conditions with any party not directly involved and included in the contract in question is prohibited unless in the presence of the other party included in said contract.  This is an article of necessity.  Through cooperation, individual goals will be met.  <Signature of both parties and witnesses for each.>  By signing above you agree to all terms, conditions, and repercussions."

loremasters,3aun1j,whynaut4,9,Tue Jun 23 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Think like a player: You're evil. You want that poncy, annoying paladin gone, either for your own ends or to please your god, probably both. Actually, it's all about you, but if it makes your god happy, win-win, right?  The only things preventing you are a piece of paper saying you'll be subject to some divine retribution crap, and the other party members. Shit, it's like they handed the guy to you on a silver platter!  Divine lightning from the sky? Immobility for two rounds? The rest of the party finding out? Your summoned creatures vanish? Easy!  You wait until you're adventuring deep in some cave or underground dungeon, where you can't get struck by lightning. Hell, promise the paladin's life to your dark god, just for the insurance! You wait until the party is asleep. You slit the paladin's throat, wait out the 12 seconds of being frozen, then go back to bed. You're still alive, and you couldn't possibly have hurt him, you have a binding contract, remember? You may be evil, but you're innocent.  Or, better yet - you summon something nasty to do the dirty work for you, with an item. No one is going to suspect a fighter of summoning crap, and hey, as soon as he's dead, the critter is going to vanish, anyway. Someone missed a spot check while they were on watch and some beastie dragged him away... You found his corpse, but the creature vanished into the dark, nowhere to be found. Better yet, as the remaining beefy tank, the party is now even more dependent on you to keep them safe from the clutches of this player-killing monster. It's foolproof!  This contract doesn't protect the paladin a whit, but gives the evil fighter a golden opportunity to kill him, gives him an ironclad alibi, and  gives him the chance to increase his position with both his god and the party. The paladin is screwed."

loremasters,3aun1j,LiesAboutAnimals,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:35 2015 UTC,Risky. How certain are you that divine lightning won't enter a cave? Or start at the cave ceiling?  And what are you gaining for this risk? The paladin has basically been neutered.

Sometimes the party then decides to try out the most simple solution, sometimes they then agree on a previously presented idea, sometimes it results in an unexpected epic action scene..."
loremasters,3ai9ko,0verlor1,2,Sun Jun 21 11:41:37 2015 UTC,"These all have names somewhere in the ludology world, and they're all good things to remember as a loremaster and teller-of-tales.  Jeepform calls this point telegraphing, which is a great term for it. Basically it boils down to assuming that it is your responsibility to provide your fellow participants with as much information is necessary to act with agency in the scenario. In The Clay that Woke, Paul Czege says that he will provide the players with far more information than their character's know, sometimes the entire backstory, in the interest of giving them a rich involvement in the narrative. I think we've been seeing a shift from withholding information for verisimilitude and meta-game-phobia to providing information freely for several years now.  The other side of the ""keeping the game going"" coin is, to steal Callisto's term for it, is narrative power. Some games, like Fate Core (and it's ancestors) and Wushu leave probably the most of the narration up to the players and the loremaster just persuades the story in certain directions. To put it another way, by giving the players the power to shape the story directly, by using ""yes, and"" or ""yes, but"" leads, they engage more in it. After all, they made it.  According to the philosophy of meaningful play, the player of a game must understand clearly the world in which they work, gain both immediate and long-term (or delayed) feedback for the actions they take, and predictable reasons for failure. At least, predictable after the first time they make the mistake.  If you can manage to incorporate all of these tenets of, simply, good game design into your game, it'll make your players very happy.  I'm glad to hear someone on /r/loremasters bringing this up! It's a great field of loremastery to study."

Skills, specialties, and other extras can be represented as ""I get +2 when I ___"" stunts, and open-ended powers work even better than they do with FATE (no mechanical distinction between melee and ranged, for example, although you're free to add in rules on range in combat zones and appropriate stunts).  Anyways, the main advantage of using Fate Accelerated is that your summons can use the same approaches as their summoner.

Most of those stories parody actual game sessions I think. In D&D magic items can have an ego score, and it determines their ability to control a character who tried to use them. The rules cover conflicts of personality. If you determined the ego score for each of the items/spirits then it would give a guide to who should win.  In the comic strip Carvin Marvin allowed himself to be defeated by Tremble after an epic battle between the two wielders. But since Tremble absorbed the souls of all he killed, he also absorbed Carvin Marvin's spirit, and since he (it?) had the stronger personality, he was able to take over the sword that was Tremble."

One studies rigorously to learn how it all works and uses that knowledge to create things and the other just finds something that works and uses it, not having any idea how it works, just that it does.  And I guess the Cleric is just a regular user who calls tech support a lot.  As for the idea itself I love the notion of 'programming' magic as a game mechanic. I can see it being nigh unbalanceable and probably extremely exploitable no matter how well you design it, but that could be half the fun. If you haven't heard about it before the game ""Path of Exile"" has an interesting magic system that essentially allows you to 'program' your casting (cast when this happens, apply this type of damage to this type of effect, add this type of effect in addition, etc)."

Each spells is the result of a form applied to a realm. That gives you many possible outcomes for effect.   So a magic spell would be ""Create"" and ""Fire"" to create a flame. From a little spark to a full fireball  The based on the desired potency the spell is harder or easier to cast.  You can do spontaneous casting, which is like the sorcerer or a ""Script Kiddies"".  Or you can do formulaic casting, based on tested formulae that requires less efforts if you know them. Like a programmer using design pattern or a well known framework."

In the world of the Laundry Files, magic is a branch of advanced math and information theory; proving certain theorems makes a reality in the platonic realm where the theorems are a physical reality, which gets the attention of multi-dimensional beings and gives them a sympathetic pathway to manifest in our three dimensional reality. In Ars Magica, spells are built using the Words of Power which correspond to different kinds of magic - characters learn to use the different verbs and nouns of magic together to create different effects. These would be good places to get ideas for what you're talking about.  Edit: almost forgot, the So You Want To Be A Wizard series by Diane Duane is also a good place to see this kind of magic in action. It has a very ""use scientific parameters to define your effects"" flavor of magic to it."
loremasters,39yvyb,IkomaTanomori,3,Tue Jun 16 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"I've thought along these lines as well.  Completing the metaphor:  Does a single individual have the mental capacity to deconstruct the 'language' of magic all the way down to the equivalent of machine code? How does a person go from commanding individual atoms to act to the point where they can control entire beings or summon a fireball?  Clerics get off easy. They merely know the right syntax to call upon the language which a deity actually translates into power or action.   Arcanists who learn some of this 'machine code' are able to inscribe it into artifacts, tomes, or make some other permanant magical object which any other person then references when they speak the magic words. In this instance it may take a lifetime to invent a new spell because it requires building it up from the threads of the universe. On the other hand, using a spell which has already been created can be very simple.  Druids and shamans then call upon creatures which have some remnant of power left in them from a fallen civilization, maybe? I'm not sure how to handle them.  hmm.. interesting thoughts."

loremasters,39yvyb,MadManuel,3,Tue Jun 16 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'm running a modern fantasy campaign where everyone has a smartphone that can directly interface with the user's magical aura.  Remember how, in most settings, a spell is a complex thing that wizards have to cast the majority of in preparation, leaving the rest to be finished in combat? The smartphone calls forth the spell you prepared by interacting with your aura until the pattern is formed, leaving you to finish the runtime parameters and send it out.  To keep most of the spell rules similar, at least part of the spell code is keyed to the particular user, and preparing a spell for the first time takes cloud computing resources. Most of the ""record in spellbook"" and ""buy scroll"" costs are from the users buying some cloud computing time to recompile the spell to their own personal aura.  The ultimate extrapolation of this is that most of the hacking in my campaign is done using the same skill for manipulating magic, as the best hackers have a strong empathic link to their phone via a well-trained aura and use it to operate their phone at the speed of thought.  As a side note, my current character in my DM's campaign (fantasy classical Greece, so quite different than my own game) is running a third-party class that can store spells in rings given a few hours and some gold, and we describe my spell-storing preparation as my PC telekinetically weaving gold circuitry and compressing it into a ring overlay, which burns out when the ring is used. That's more electrical engineering than programming, admittedly."

So, while I was thinking about your idea, I had the image of an office somewhere in a downbeat area where a disheveled wizard in a stained robe meets clients who ask him to build spells according to specific requirements. Wizards in this world would be like programmers and lawyers, sure, anyone who wants to learn magical grammar (the codified mystical lores, the special rituals of the church, etc) can, but just like in our world, not everyone is a programmer.

Sure, but good luck explaining that to the Church. Human Spirits, you say? Well, that's called Necromancy.   Step 2: Burn an actual circuit using tools, wiring, etc. Burning it on an animal? Sure, it's called a Chimaera. On a human being? Not easy, but certainly possible.  Stop 3: Turn it on/off as needed. And whatever you do, protect both the circuit and the Gem."

loremasters,39vyzu,MadManuel,10,Mon Jun 15 06:22:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with epic level style adventures is that they suffer from a complete rework on narrative structure.  In a regular adventure, there are always bigger fish.  Big scary things that might not necessarily care, but they exist and you probably want them on your side or to continue to be completely ignorant.  A 3.5 D&D character at 16-18 (since you mentioned d20) has all of the following looming over their head:   Exceptionally gifted giants Mature adult and older dragons Higher level people High CR outsiders (devils, angels, demons, etc.).  Pit fiends and balors and solars are extremely powerful, and there are even worse fiends / celestials out there.  Slaad never seem to get high level versions of themselves written up, but whatever lawful opposition there is for that edition often do (Primus of Mechanus was terrifying!). Nobility of the inner planes (PoEarth, Air, Fire, Water, Positive and Negative Energy) The top tier undead (death knights, liches, astral mummies, etc.  Not to mention demi-liches!) The Far Realm Illithid elder brains and other high end aberrations  (beholder mages say hello!) High-end golems (Adamantine and Mithril golems come to mind specifically, but even advanced iron golems are rough for a party of level 17s). The nobility of the Unseely Court (or Seely Court, for that matter).  Fey, if you're not familiar with the terms.   Etc.  I didn't even get into the actual deities, or entities like the Githyanki Lich Queen (who actually meta-games IN UNIVERSE), or deity aspects / avatars, or demi-gods, or epic dragons, or etc.  There's always something big and scary around the corner that you can use as a unifier.  The PCs need to work together to defeat the ______.  When you get into the kind of stuff you're dealing with, you lose that.  They've climbed to the top of the heap.  This leaves you with three options:  1) ""Screw it, new bigger badder baddies!""  It allows you to maintain the story structure you're familiar with, but quickly becomes ridiculous as you keep pulling new enemies out of nowhere.  The challenge here is two-fold: come up with antagonists that seem plausible, and preventing the players from feeling like all that hard work they put into their characters wasn't a waste of time because there will always be a Superer Megaer Ultimater Ultraer Dragon around the corner.  Some good examples of this are the ridiculous enemies in superhero comics (Onslaught?  Doomsday?), the ridiculousness of Dragon Ball Z, or so on.    2) Completely change the story style.  They're the top of the heap and they probably want to stay that way.  There can still be threats to them - get enough goblins and a level 5 will be sweating, for example - but any individual challenge can be met with any individual party member.  Narrative has to become more political, more... paranoid.  More backstabby.  Their enemies are weaker but far more numerous, and they're coming to take your place through any means they can.  Some good examples of this include a group of parody stories of 2nd ed D&D I read years and years ago about ""Sick Sword"", when superheroes are challenged by political tension instead of a big scary villain (they COULD just kill everyone, but that's not their jam), and so on.  I haven't watched or read any Game of Thrones, but I suspect it's a low powered version of this as well.  3)  Good game, guys.  Let's start a new campaign."

New hammer for Thor causes him to teleport away secretly and go on a rampage every 48 hours but then return as if nothing happened.  Intelligent weapons too. B) Family heritage gone awry - couple of possibilities, either they're previously kings or lords of X but now their nascent godhood puts the country at risk (china would attack if they thought our president had become a demigod) or if they're directly related to someone of importance in the kingdom, their name may be abused (""my brother is a god and will level your kingdom! ""). C)  Less powerful enemies? Sure, but if they have extra-planar help or wishes on their side it can stack up pretty well.  And there's always numbers - the PCs won't look like good guys if they singlehandedly wiped out 1000 of the other king's best men.  That adds up. D)  The thing about becoming the top of the heap is that those on the heaps elsewhere in the universe can now see you.  Facing a few godly avatars with multiple mature dragons isn't going to be a cakewalk.  Especially since they're smart and powerful enough to divide the party by sending one dragon here, another dragon there, and have a golem with them while they attack the party.  Yes this falls into the bigger based baddies category but it fits.  Especially if the party starts doing extra-planar activities.    My experience says do a few big story sessions from the above, and then offer each player a solo mission to retire the character.  If it's Bob's turn to retire, let him decide how and where, devise an adventure to get there, and let the other players create level 10-15 characters for a one shot.  They're helping their god get into Valhalla or whatever.  It will be epic, they can die if need be, etc.  Next session a different player gets to be it."

After the chaos of the Imperial civil war, New Orleans provided some much needed local stability, ushering in a time of peace. During peace time, there was less need for external protection, and so in an attempt to increase revenue, the New Orleans High Council elected to hire the city Guard out to private interests as well. Ex) A mine shaft pierces the Underdark, so the Guard is hired to keep the mine safe, leaving the nearby village with less protection.

loremasters,39lk39,Myllis,12,Fri Jun 12 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"They key thing to realize about the Chryalids is the game for which they were created.  In XCOM all of your squad members have ranged weapons of varying optimal ranges. The Chrysalids circumvent the ranged vs melee advantage by being very fast to close any long distance and hitting extremely hard once they have closed that distance. They remove the strength of the player (overlapping fields of fire, coordinated and deliberate movements, over watch and alpha strikes). Additionally, they present a game clock. If you leave the Chrysalids alone, they often go about the map flanking or turning civilians into zombies.   D&D is is a game based upon the assumption that player characters either have some one who can take a hit protecting the other PCs, or the PCs can control/burn down anything before losing too many resources. Trying to make the Chrysalids as they appear in XCOM wouldn't work as well because they don't work against the strengths of the PCs. You expect the paladin and fighter to be in melee already and you don't plan mechanics around PCs dying because it'll almost never come up (If it does come up often, you might be killing your PCs too much). The Chrysalids just become a weird looking monster that hits.   For the Chrysalids to work best you need three mechanical conditions.    The Party to start at range and prefer staying range. Some NPCs for the Chrysalids to nom on and make into zombies. An environment that forces the PCs into disadvantageous locations.   Granted, you could change them a bit to fill the same role they do in XCOM but tuned for D&D. How does your party prefer to engage their foes? Make something that forces them to do thing differently? What are the parties greatest strengths? Make something that is particularly strong against that."

Obviously the downside is that you might wreck peoples characters and it might be too much. On the other hand this is why the classic level drain made undead monsters so horrifying. Once you got level drained that level was gone. Forever. No amount of restoration could restore it. You'd have to regain any and all levels the slow way. And there was no save for it either.

I've never played XCOM, so I don't know much about Chrysalids. Based on the posts here, some changes that probably need to be done are;   Advance them to Medium- or Large-sized creatures as needed Remove the fly speed, increase the land speed to match their performance in the game, or just keep the Quickness (Ex) for more movement. The Implant Eggs ability will give you the ability to turn a kill into another Chrysalid. Maybe make this only usable on a dying and/or helpless opponent? If the zombies are capable of doing anything, you might want to just stat them as a zombie with bonus HP for the couple rounds they exist. If you keep the Outsider subtype, they're immune to poison and mind-affecting abilities, add on immune to stunning, crits if desired. Change the sting attacks to 2 claws. Up the damage to 1d6 if Medium, 1d8 if Large. Finally, most Medium-sized Vermin-type have a poison save DC of 13-15, with 1d4 initial and secondary damage to either Dex or Str. Make it whatever is closest to the game in terms of flavor."

Many undead have a ""create spawn"" ability that is perfect for the zombie creation.  I otherwise agree with /u/BobertMk2. Chrysalids are intended to be particularly scary due to their speed, nasty effects, and melee attacks. In a game with meatshield characters, that fear will be harder to capture."

Like someone suggested with Spider Wasps, just accelerate the growth rate. Granted, at CR6 already, you're looking at these things generating swarms in the proper conditions. I probably wouldn't drop them on players as an actual combat situation until they could either control the increasing numbers somehow, or turn the terrain to their advantage.

loremasters,39jsjk,AllUrMemes,2,Fri Jun 12 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"I've always considered something like this. Also, then there's the very real possibility that, without knowing the ""standard"" spells, or like only one of a set, then they wouldn't be creative enough to make them up.   Like, evocation is easy... Fire ball, ice ball, fire ray, ice ray, cone of fire, cone of cold, etc. But what about illusion? Or enchantment? And the only transmutation spell I can think of is polymorph, which is like 7th level (in D&D 5e.)"
loremasters,39jsjk,Pixelnator,2,Fri Jun 12 05:56:43 2015 UTC,"Imaginative uses of schools can make for some pretty flexible schools. Invisibility works just as well whether you're actually invisible (illusion) or making people think you're not there (enchantment). Transmutation can give you camouflage which is almost as good.  Immobilization is easy with enchantment (Don't want to move), slightly more complex with illusion (Don't seem to move) and fairly straightforward with transmutation (Can't move) as you can just lock joints or encase their feet with earth.  As for straightforward damage, illusion and enchantmend could both do it via self-harm or psychic damage (fry their brains via enchantment). Transmutation would be the standard warp flesh or hostile terrain. If illusion allows the use of shadow material then sky is the limit as it is just a lesser form of conjuration at that point.  Low level illusions and enchantment already exist but for transmutation it might be temporary tricks like intentional weakening of matter via warping or stuff like bending weapons and armour to make them ineffective or giving them a sharper serrated edge or stronger structure to improve them.  Just some random musings."

In theory a wizard could just buy scrolls and copy those into their spellbook (albeit with some difficulty) to gain spells? I like the idea because sorcerers are all about gaining power themselves and growing into their boots, but a wizard could go his whole life without making or getting new spells and still level up, no?  edit: I read that and thought it was ""wizards and sorcerers only gain 1 new spell per level"" my bad."
loremasters,39jsjk,HighSalinity,2,Fri Jun 12 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"It's an optional part of the class for both.   I see wizards as engineers of magic. They can deconstruct the exact meta-scientific processes and components of spells and magic, and in turn,  they know how to use their knowledge to engineer a new spell.   Sorcerers are much more driven by emotional,  passion,  and primal forces.  Power flows through them,  and they get good at collecting and translating it,  making the power into spells by sheer force of will and instinct. They can literally concentrate and will a new spell into existence if they try hard enough.   I can see how both have the potential to create new spells.  That being said,  they do only get to create one spell per spell level, the rest of their spells are chosen from a spell list as per usual."

Wizards are just as much about the discovering and unraveling of mysteries as they are learning what mankind already knows.

loremasters,39jsjk,Rangourthaman_,3,Fri Jun 12 11:24:41 2015 UTC,"Hrmmm. Damage starts at 1d6/8/10 depending on single target, cone, or aoe. Adding an extra dice increases the spell level by .5-1. Extra effects such as blind, stun, snare, charm etc add another 1 to spell level? So a 4d6 AOE that blinds would be a level 4-6 spell. Not massively powerful, but allows for customisability, such as a spell that blinds, silences and binds someone as a level 3ish. Perhaps extra modifiers can be added for a quickened spell effect (bonus action) or one with an extended effect. Spitballing this and input from more experienced people would be nice."
loremasters,39jsjk,teufer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:49:09 2015 UTC,"It sounds good from what you say... except this part:   Perhaps extra modifiers can be added for a quickened spell effect (bonus action) or one with an extended effect.    bonus action is actually a lot more powerful than you think. From what I observe, that is normally reserved for things like counters, shields, minor heals, or itty-bitty things like prestidigitation (which is a full action, actually.) And it's not an affect of how long it takes to go off, but instead how long it takes for the caster to cast; all spells need a Visual, Somatic, and sometimes need a Material component. That's what the action takes, for you to wave your hand in the proper pattern and say the right words to cast the spell.   also with your idea of the ""extended effect,"" it would be cool but that doesn't mean that they can't already have long/short effects. This wouldn't cost it ""more"" levels but duration is something you need to consider. A kind of charm spell, but instead they are feared or other CC? I'd say a minute. You gain a buff to armor? I'd say an hour. You want to make a combo of disguise-self and disguise-aura? I'd say a around 8 hours- but even 9th level spells like Weird have a duration of only a minute.   Finally, I think you need to think about method of delivery, like how is it an AoE? What surface area does it cover, and how does it arrive?"
loremasters,39jsjk,decemberwolf,2,Fri Jun 12 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"I've done this! I GM'd a game wherein one of the players was a smart carpenters son. He tried his hand at carpentry but he couldn't keep his mind on it. In an effort to see a bit more of the world he worked riding a mail cart to and from neighbouring towns and cities. Often there was a smallish chest circulated between a few selected nobles. It was nothing special in and by itself but it intrigued him. It was made of decent wood and all the ironwork was sturdy but plain. He couldn't help himself and after 4 months devised a plan to open and close the chest without trace. He found that despite the simple looks the chest was impossible to crack!  Many a sleepless night was spent wondering the contents of the box. He had tried loosening the iron and wood in various places but as soon as he was making some headway his vision seemed to tunnel, feverish evenly as sweat broke out and broke his concentration. He wiped his brow and rubbed his eyes for a moment. As he tried again he realised he had made almost no headway at all! What is this trickery?!  In that moment he realized why he knew the box was standing out to him. Where many are blind, he could see! It was just a feeble glimpse but very real and right there nonetheless. He left the box in the cart and returned to sit by his camp. That night he realized what he wanted, what he could do and be good at it! It took him two months effort and practice before he weaved his first words of power, and understood more of the chest.  In the end he didn't even physically open the chest but communicated with a wandering soul and asked him if he would look in the chest for him. He asked him to read the words found on the papers within, out of order, afraid to set off an unintended effect. He copied the spells and made an ethereal friend in the process.  I gave him a blank book at the start of the session. We used the white wolf system so he could roll INT+Magic x D10. In his case a healthy six dice to throw. This skill represents guidance in magic, not the magic itself. This to make it more story driven and less dependant on dice gameplay. So when the roll was good I would help him better understand whatever he was trying to do and give him cryptic hints or pointed his attention to a particular detail. When he would fail I would off course send him in the wrong direction. (Leading to some hilarious results!)  Edit: Magic in my world is often very imbalanced and almost always comes at a big cost. No fireballing pointy hat mages in my world. Some take days of preparation or need items only available in some seasons. Some are just jarring or unnatural, for instance; he fashioned something to be able to breathe underwater. He would cut open his palm and hold the stone for the duration. Problem was that the human body seems to reject fluids from the lungs! Who knew? So after about a week of barrel-practice drowning/waterboarding himself he got the hang of it."
loremasters,39jsjk,Corund,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"It's generally an interesting idea, which can develop in some interesting in-game elements. I generally suggest the players to develop their own magic, but I put different constraints depending on the system. In D&D 3.5 I'm usually pretty relaxed with the spell ideas (I mean, the system is already broken) and usually just add some costs or drawbacks only when they are even worst than the one in the manual. In D10 games you have more defined limits per level of power so it's easy to attune the spells to the system and I'm a bit more rigid with them.  Generally, this leads to a lot of fun, since developing a spell isn't an easy task and sometimes it gives me hooks for side quests that will really involve the party since generally PC start to devise spells to do things they want done but can't do themselves."

loremasters,39iq6o,lhenson937,14,Fri Jun 12 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"I'm no social scientist, but I'll try!  Assuming these orcs retain their tribal and military culture, they would use this resource to their advantage.  Trading with other humanoid empires, they could arm themselves with steel, greatly enhancing their already formidable martial capacity.  With greater power, though, the orcish drive for power would lead to more in-fighting.  Let's say, then, that a clever human merchant prince backed one of these orcish chieftains in exchange for exclusive trading rights.  This alliance might result in a transformed orcish society, one that interacts more regularly with other humanoid races, and one unified under the leadership of a single king.  While I doubt they would build any academies or embrace the high arts, you might see a civilization more akin to ancient Sparta.  Some developments that might ensue would be a standardized currency, standing army with an official hierarchy, and the construction of permanent stone settlements, as they don't have to rely on marauding anymore.  Much like ancient Sparta, such an orcish empire would come into conflict often with surrounding kingdoms, but they would be much more likely to cooperate against common threats.  More intermingling would also result in a greater population of half-orcs, most of whom would probably fit in more with their orcish parents due to their sort of indiscriminate social Darwinist perspective.  Half-orcs, in turn, would bring cultural changes to the empire from the other side of their heritage.  I think non-orc residents would be tolerated, if at least not despised, in this orcish society.  Orc mercenaries would probably become valued companies, hired by merchants and city-states with few scruples.  This would probably improve the reputation of orcs from being bloodthirsty savages to rotten sellswords :P  Anyways, those are just a few ideas."

Caravan after caravan is importing food here, and soon the population is so large it can't even be supported by what's left of the local agriculture. No matter, just buy more food.  Soon they will be hiring skilled foreigners to do all their work for them. Even the lowliest orc will no longer work in the mines or at menial labor, it is beneath his dignity as a warrior born of the blessed Goldorkland tribe. Instead he receives a gold stipend from the chief-kings, as a ""gift"" -- but really a mass bribe not to rebel against the ruling classes. He is also bought off with bread and circuses: violent blood sports in the most terrible arenas in the known world.  Who works the mines? Originally the orcs, later prisoners of war and convicts, and finally an entire slave economy. Why should an orc work a mine when he can buy a slave? Gruumsh gave the gold to the tribe of Goldorkland because Gruumsh is the greatest god and these are his chosen people, destined to rule the world. The slave market in their capital is the largest scene of misery on the planet. This vortex of slavery effects the entire region, for every criminal, corrupt ruler and bandit gang within 300 miles knows they can always sell captives for a nice chunk of gold in Goldorkland.  To support the ruling class and control the restless masses, the chief-kings throw money at their priests. Massive, hideous temples to their violent gods are built. Every ridiculous ancient superstition of the old orcish deities is now part of a full blown state religion which of course supports slavery, blood sports, and the ruling class. Sacrifices of slaves and prisoners of war.   To channel the seething unrest within the society, from the nobles to the lower classes, holy wars are waged against their ancient enemies. Expensive, bloody holy wars. Armies full of hired mercenaries and Gruumshite fanatics. Maybe even slave soldiers like the Unsullied.  And one day the gold fields start to run low..."

One or more nearby city states perhaps had good dealings with the mob, perhaps even have related leadership through blood or marriage. In any case, they consider the PCs to be nothing more than mercenary warlords that have taken the town, and dispatch a handful of militias and a trade embargo to right the problem.  A minor feud between two local families (which the mob was acting as an arbiter of) threatens to boil over into a blood vendetta when the son of one elopes with the daughter of another. The PCs must find the lovers, negotiate a truce, and help true love prevail.  Turns out, the mob was dealing with necromancers on the side, shuffling them off dead bodies in return for not attacking the city and, in fact, protecting it from the shadows. The shady necromancers approach the party with a similar deal - and, if the party doesn't take it, the necromancers and their skellington armies suddenly have a vested interest in running the town instead."
loremasters,39fyt4,andanteinblue,2,Thu Jun 11 14:16:22 2015 UTC,There was a blood feud between two cities already which is great. It killed both entire families down to one daughter of each house. The other city tried to sue for peace and the mob princess took it for weakness. She didn't plan on the other girl having connections and that was how the PCs got hired in to handle the mob girl. Now the other girl knows that the mob city will never settle for her rule so she lets the pcs take charge to avoid conflict. There are probably people that still wish to continue the blood feud so I can really play on that with lesser houses.
