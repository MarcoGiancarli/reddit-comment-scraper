I have been using Win 10 for months now and it is absolutely relentless when it comes to updates, which I find infuriating.   The way I work with my machine is that I rarely close any programs (32gb of Ram), so shutting the machine and rebooting is a whole thing until I am back to where I was before.   This is particularly annoying when I am working on something and Windows decides that it needs to reboot now, or when I come back to my PC next morning, just to be presented with a login screen.  It's not just an annoyance but can lead to data loss and what not. You can't pull the rug out under every program, which Windows now does.

software,3dw4rm,Koalchemy,19,Mon Jul 20 00:56:11 2015 UTC,"Never defragment your SSD. Not only will it not improve performance whatsoever (accessing/writing data is the same speed regardless of whether the data is defragmented or not in an SSD), but it will actually be detrimental to the lifespan of the SSD because SSDs have a limited amount of data that can be written before they no longer work. In fact, defragment software often warn against defragmenting your SSD or flash drives, having an option to disable that in their settings. However, don't concern yourself with this limit because the technology nowadays makes this less of a problem.  Also, leave ~20-25% free space on the SSD; otherwise, the performance of the drive will be hindered. A smart thing to do would be installing your OS/applications on the SSD to utilize the performance benefits of the SSD. If there's more space, install games on it so they load faster, etc. Media such as movies/music/pictures/documents benefit very little from being on the SSD--you already access them near instantaneously on a HDD so they should stay there unless you really have nothing else to add to your SSD such that it would be ~75-80% full."

This way you have a copy of the original DVD in a single file instead of folders. Just a matter of preference.  Since you mentioned copying to a computer and trying Handbrake, I'll say that Handbrake is good for ripping the video from a DVD to a format for watching on a computer (Although VLC and probably some others will open the iso file or VIDEO_TS folder directly) or other device, or for streaming online, etc. Using Handbrake can be fairly straightforward. Click ""Source"" and choose your ISO file or VIDEO_TS folder (again it's best not to go directly from a physical disc), fill in somewhere for the destination, and choose a preset on the right (I generally go with ""High Profile"").

You could then mount the bin file in the virtual drive and it should work. Honestly it might just be easier to burn actual CDs.

Saying ""I'll do this today"" and spending 3 hours making a list and planning how to do it is not nearly as effective as just jotting down a few list of stuff to do one day and then spend the week/month trying to do whatever you can.

Where I work we often use a generic latex template that then takes in another file with a bunch of parameters and then automatically generates a PDF Report with all new data.

In the high end unix world, UniTree from EMC and HPSS from IBM are a couple of the products that do this.  In practice, for the typical consumer, this would probably have to be done using a network share (possibly run and mounted on the same machine), where the server program manages pushing and pulling the file data from the cloud. Otherwise, there would need to be a different filesystem on the local disk, and who wants to reformat their hard drive?

If you are going to use something like this, I highly recommend getting your own cloud server (vps for example) at the very least. Storing all files on the cloud in encrypted form and/or using a secure form of connection would additionally increase security, but having your own server should fix most security issues even without additional safety measures.

software,3dcz6q,The_Drider,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:24:47 2015 UTC,"just got the idea of an extended harddisk driver/application in such a fashion that files which you have either tagged or have not been accessed in a long time (OS files excluded) get transparently moved into the cloud, thus freeing up physical harddrive space.   Doesn't this already exist?  You can do this yourself with the DropBox api. Simply check the last time the file was accessed and if it was long ago then just upload to the cloud and delete the file from your computer  downside to this method is availability... I mean you always need internet and preferably a fast one just in case you want toa access your files. Another downside is the unnecessary read/write of your harddrive.  I think it's better to invest in more harddrives."

Comments like that are what make IT / any technical industry job suck. You can work in the industry for 30 years and not have a moment of downtime, redundant everything, then a fucking plane lands on the server farm and suddenly you're completely incompetent. Some a-hole uses hindsight to say 'shoulda planned for { unthinkable, unrealistic scenario }' and now your boss demands to know why you didn't have a no-fly-zone and anti-aircraft missiles. Nevermind the 30 years of flawless service; get some damn missiles and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow."
software,3d6ag8,A_Light_Spark,3,Tue Jul 14 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"3 points I'd like to clarify: A. It is obviously a mistake, and there's no way to sugar coat it. What is the core function of an exchange? To trade stocks (among other things). In this update, they couldn't trade anything. It's not like a car that has a broken AC, it's more like the brakes on the car failed or the engine doesn't even start. What would you do if that happens to your car? And now imagine some manufacturer screwed up millions of cars.      B. A history of good service doesn't excuse for any accidents or mistakes. Say if a nuclear power plant has been safe for the last 50 years, but now one of the core is having a melt down and radiation starts leaking... does the company get a break for ""good record?"" No... especially not when the ""default"" state requires the product/service to run without harm. Again, imagine you've bought a home in the area because you've read about the good record of the power plant.      C. Unlike other major manufacturing/programming companies, they don't have a hard deadline to follow on ""product release."" There is probably very little company pressure to ""get the product out so we can start paying our investors."" The exchange has money. Their engineers are (likely) well paid. On top of that, they have plenty of down time and don't have to run their server 24/7. Unlike Facebook or the softwares used for hospital patients, the exchange got a lot of time to make sure things should work."
software,3d6ag8,frothface,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"1 - I've had brakes fail. It's scary. But when 5 million cars roll off the line and one has a brake issue, you don't say ""they obviously didn't test anything at all"".  2 - That's a little bit of an extreme example. A meltdown would be the equivalent of the exchange losing all of their data. A brief interruption in trading is more like a nuclear plant losing power for a few hours. People lose power. That's why you have things like redundant power, redundant UPS and redundant backup generators.  3  Wrong. http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/after-hours.aspx   Edit: Also, funny that you chose nuclear power. Most of the safety in nuclear power plants comes out of HPT - human performance technology. You assume that anything that can fail will fail, including the humans overseeing the operation. If the exchange is that important that you need anti-aircraft missiles, then surely you can hire an additional person to oversee that testing is actually done. What actually happens is no one throws out the idea of anti-aircraft missiles and additional staffing because the company would scoff at the expense (or the asset just isn't worth that amount of protection)."
software,3d6ag8,A_Light_Spark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm certain I'm not wrong on point C:     4:15 - 8:00 PM     Not to mention the traffic after hour trading isn't as heavy as the regular hours one. When it's comes to release date, it isn't uncommon to get into 80hr-week crunch time. (not that it's acceptable, but at least release date ± 1 month is almost always critical time) They have all the time in the world to work on the main frame after 8 - and remember there's no trading on Saturday, assuming they even get Sunday off. AND, remember there's no pressure to release buggy products, they could have taken 3 more weeks for testing if they needed to.      As for other points... I think you missed the context. For the car manufacturer case, itd be the equivalent of a fundamental fault on the design level, thus affecting many users, like the infamous (but not so unsafe) Ford Pinto. As for the nuclear case, it's extreme, but it's not unthinkable (and has in fact, happened in Chernobyl and Fukushima). It's to show why it's important to be consistent, even in the face of accidents.      If Linus were to work with the exchange devs... he'd be ripping them apart by now. Or, imagine redditor/Facebook is down for 1/3 of a day due to an update error. You think the programmers here would let that slide?"

The short answer is, no, uninstalling when done without error, causes no harm to the OS. BUT! Installing may. Or if you are not talking about the direct corruption, deletion, moving, or renaming of Windows System files, but instead the general perception of the operating system running slower, then again, this is caused by the installing of software, not the uninstalling. More explained below:  When you install a program, many things can occur. Below I will list a few of the things that happens when installing, and consequently what uninstalling does in relation to those things, or how they affect the system.   Unpacking to a temp folder: Most installers will unpack themselves (typicallying compressed .exe or .msi files). This puts the contents of this compressed file into a folder in a temp directory (in most cases, sometimes it unpacks directly into live memory). Depending on the location it unpacks to, this temp directory may NEVER be cleaned automatically by the system. This merely takes up disk space and the only negative effect it would have is potentially affecting the fragmentation levels of the hard drive, which is less of a concern now than it was in the 90's when hard drives were tiny. When you uninstall a program they very very rarely clean out the temp folder they installed from. Create a Program Files folder: Almost all program will default to installing in either C:\Program Files\ or C:\Program Files (x68)\, depending on the application and your OS being 32 or 64-bit. This is perfectly normal and acceptable, and even a good thing, as it means your software is organized well. When uninstalling, MOST (but definitely not all) programs will remove themselves from the program files directory. Some may leave behind the folder and a few small files in case you reinstall. Though these are minor intrusions, and may be done so with good intentions. When I uninstall something, I want it gone. So again, this only affects the usage of storage space and fragmentation. Local Storage, App Data, and User Profiles: In C:\Users\ all user accounts for the computer are given a folder to keep their stuff in. There are also a few system folders (the amount varies depending on Windows version), like Default or Public. In your user account there will be hidden system folders like AppData. As the name and location imply, this is where user specific application data is stored. It's very common for applications to do this and very rare for them to delete or remove themselves from these sections upon uninstall, as most software makers believe users would prefer not to lose their user specific settings and data in case they reinstall. Again, this only affects storage usage and hard drive performance based on fragmentation. The big bad registry: Most programs will touch your computer's registry during install. And in fact will add in lots of stuff all over the place in the registry. In hundreds or even thousands of locations in it depending on the size of the software. Basically NO software cleans up after themselves in the registry during/after an uninstall. Some of the reasoning behind this is legit, as touching the registry at the wrong time could corrupt it and then you'd have trouble booting up into windows. Also if you've every used software with a 30 day trial, and tried to trick it by uninstalling/reinstalling, only to find out it's still expired, that's the registry. They put the original install date in there so you can't fool them. Also the registry typically holds software keys for stuff you have a license for. But it also holds thousands of other settings and information. Information you don't need after you've uninstalled, but yet there it remains. Installing and Uninstalling lots of programs means your registry gets bloated and filled with junk you don't need anymore, it makes it hard to read stuff from it quickly, which in turn slows down basic operations like refreshing/loading desktop icons, etc. This process of your registry getting bogged down over the use of a machine and causing it to slow is known as ""bit-rot"".     Solutions!  So here's how to run a fast computer:   When you get a new computer, Install a vanilla (non-oem) copy of windows. Just basic plain windows. The downside here is you'll need to download and install all your own drivers, but the upside is your drivers will be the most up-to-date versions and you won't have a bunch of junk programs pre-installed taking up space in your registry and appdata locations. Whenever possible use Portable Apps. These are programs that run without the need to install. They can even be ran directly off a flash drive (hence portable). Liberkey is by far the best and easiest place to get started as it will keep your portable apps updated and offers hundreds of them to handle just about anything. Set your computer to autodefrag monthly (or weekly, doesn't matter). Run CCleaner (portable version is on their website or available via liberkey). This will clean up your registry and temp folders. Periodically run this. There are other registry cleaners (Reg Cleaners) out there that are overly aggressive in their clean up and can cause harm. CCleaner is the only one I trust to run it blind without checking it's results before cleaning. In an instance where a portable version of the software you want doesn't exist, after installing it, be sure to reboot. No matter how small the program is. If you make it a habbit of rebooting after every install, your computer will be much happier for it.   For more information, look at the /r/24HourSupport Wiki for the section on running a fast and happy computer.    Instances where Installing/Uninstalling will actually corrupt your OS.  This is stuff where Windows System files will be deleted, corrupted, renamed, or relocated in a manner that has a negative affect on Windows.   Double wrapping your protection: If you have an Anti-Virus installed (Norton, McAfee, Sophos, Trend Micro, Kaspersky, etc) and you try to install another one. After a reboot, all sorts of bad stuff can happen, from random blue screens, to not loading windows, to no internet connection, to the computer freezing just after the desktop loads, etc. Always uninstall your Anti-Virus first, then reboot, then install the new one. Other wise they fight each other. (especially Norton, it conflicts with EVERYTHING, I've even seen it conflict with itself. Others aren't much better though). Power outage: During an install (especially of windows updates and large programs like Adobe Creative Suites, Microsoft Office, Tax Suites, etc.) If the power goes out or your batter dies, partway through the install, it can damage system files and cause issues with booting to windows, blue screens, etc. Corrupt downloads: Sometimes if you have a flakey internet connection you may download something that didn't get all the bits in the right order or didn't finish or whatever, and trying to run it will partially work and thus cause problems. This doesn't happen as much as it used to a decade ago. Bad drivers: Sometimes you install the wrong driver and things go crazy. Download the correct one and install it instead. Most driver installers are pretty good now about not letting you install them if you don't have the right hardware, but it can still happen sometimes. If you need help with an issue like this, /r/24HourSupport. Installing multiple programs at once: If you are installing two or more programs at the exact same time, then it's very possible for them to both be editing the registry simultaneously which of course will screw everything up. Same goes for uninstalling multiple things simultaneously, or installing something while uninstalling something else."

Do you have any sources to back this up? I've never seen anything which suggests cleaning your registry does anything at all. In fact, I've seen lots of the opposite and it's part of the reason why Microsoft no longer provides a registry cleaner.  Also, bit-rot is hypothetical and is merely an attempt to explain why things slow down. Linking it as a term to the registry is completely unwarranted.  I've always though of the registry like a harddrive - what's in it doesn't matter as long as there's space (and it's the registry, there always will be). Do you have any links with more information?"

C) In terms of symbols it sounds interesting, but it worries me that while nice these new 'symbols' while considered a feature make using it less portable. ie you are creating a subset on top of regex that will make it so that people using your nice and easy tool are getting out regex strings that are not portable to straight regex in another language. I love good gui tools for regex testing for one off log files, they make it a lot nicer / quicker. However not being able to copy / paste the regex defeats this purpose.  D) Being the perl guy at heart that I am, I love CPAN and routinely use the Regexp namespace for templates. This allows me to use ""$RE{num}{real}"" for a real number which of course returns the regex for a real number or ""$RE{CC}{Mastercard}"" to return the regex for a mastercad (which actually does the luhn check for a MC as well).

The videos are in ""fragmented flash"" files, where the server sends small flv fragments to the flash client, which makes it a little more complicated since the full video file isn't available. Someone made a php script that you can find on GitHub. The one you want is AdobeHDS.php. There's a wiki describing its use. I found it in a forum post, which also talks about how to use it.   You'll of course need php installed (and in your path) to run the php script. If you need them, there are instructions on installing php at the bottom of the wiki.  Once you've got that ready, you'll need the manifest URL. The easiest way I've found to get this is with Chrome's Developer tools. To do this, open the page in Chrome, and, with the Developer Tools Network tab open, click the 'Watch the Video' link. Look for a file name that starts with 'manifest.f4m'. Right click on that, and Copy Link Address. Now go to the folder where you want to download the video, and open a command prompt. For ease, you may want to copy AdobeHDS.php to this directory. In the command prompt, run AdobeHDS.php like this:   php AdobeHDS.php --manifest '$manifest_url' --delete --parallel 8   where $manifest_url is the URL you copied from Chrome. The 'delete' and parallel arguments are optional. It deletes the fragments after joining them. The 'parallel' argument tells the program how many pieces to download at the same time. Eight is the default.   That got long. Hopefully that makes sense. The hardest part IMO is getting the manifest URL. I think it would be a lot easier if you didn't have to click that link to load the video.  Anyway, let me know if you need any help. I was able to use this method to download the video on the page you linked."

It's mainly used for websites and 2d video games to create a spritemap of lots of small images into one medium to large size image. Most of them won't be able to handle large scale images.  Spritecow for example is a very simple to use but it's for tiny icons, not big photos.  There will definitely be some sprite algorithm out there that can handle this, it just may be behind a large barrier of technical skill, like requiring you to understand what node and grunt are and how to use them."

software,3cadbr,Myrdraal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"Well, let me answer that part by part. For a start, we're all using our accounts on different places, but do you login at all of your accounts on your friends PCs or just some, which you remembered the password for even before you started using a password manager?  And you practically gave yourself a solution, if you're using your phone all the time, you can store your database file on your phone and when it's needed somewhere, plug it in, use the portable KeePass and you'd be fine. Which, before you say how that's a bit of work, brings me to a question: If you're using LastPass, do you install that browser extension at every friend's browser? Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if your friend had a keylogger installed without knowing, and you use your LastPass login credentials there? In that case someone got what they needed, all they need is to install LastPass at their home and they have access to your logins, or am I wrong?  Thing with KeePass local database is that you won't twitch if there's suddenly an article ""[online]database hacked, millions of passwords compromised!"". That's not likely to happen, but I guess you can  consider that if you're considering that KeePass database file is endangered by putting it into a Dropbox. That's practically a well chosen password of Dropbox behind a well chosen password of Keepass database file, but that isn't all! This sounds like an ad haha, but you can also use a so called key file, any file you choose, that you'd have to pick along with entering the right master password, if that file isn't there, no one is able to enter your database even while having your password by any chance.  Reason why I love KeePass due to it's local database is that every time I add a new password, I'm not telling LastPass ""Hey, this is my password, save it on your server"". Yes, I know it's encrypted, and I realise that it should be safe, I just feel this is safer, it's okay if our opinions disagree! ;)  As for using it on your phone, http://www.keepassdroid.com/ :)  As for hacking attacks for breaking the password, there's also this option: http://i.imgur.com/gBxcGP3.png  As I've said before when discussing this topic, it's a matter of choice. Both KeePass and LastPass are nice options, both of them having certain advantage points, it all comes down to what you need from a password manager."
software,3cadbr,letmetrythis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:03:23 2015 UTC,"do you login at all of your accounts on your friends PCs or just some, which you remembered the password for even before you started using a password manager?   Well, for me the point of a password manager is to have random passwords for every site.  So really I don't know a large majority of my passwords.  I know my gmail password and that's pretty much it.     And you practically gave yourself a solution, if you're using your phone all the time, you can store your database file on your phone and when it's needed somewhere, plug it in, use the portable KeePass and you'd be fine.   But now I gotta carry a USB cable around!  haha   If you're using LastPass, do you install that browser extension at every friend's browser?   No, you can log in to your password vault at lastpass.com.  No need to install the browser extension.   Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if your friend had a keylogger installed without knowing, and you use your LastPass login credentials there? In that case someone got what they needed, all they need is to install LastPass at their home and they have access to your logins, or am I wrong?   No, I have two-factor authentication enabled.  So even if they had my master password they'd need my phone to get the code for login.  And if they tried that, Lastpass would alert me that somebody tried to log in from an unknown computer.   This sounds like an ad haha, but you can also use a so called key file, any file you choose, that you'd have to pick along with entering the right master password, if that file isn't there, no one is able to enter your database even while having your password by any chance.   is that their version of two-factor authentication?     As I've said before when discussing this topic, it's a matter of choice. Both KeePass and LastPass are nice options, both of them having certain advantage points, it all comes down to what you need from a password manager.   Totally!  It sounds like it's not for me.  I like Lastpass because of how utterly seamless it is to use on every device I may need it to be on.  It sounds like you can hack keypass to do all lastpass does, thought, so that's good.  But it doesn't sound like there's a good reason for me to switch."

Just a suggestion, if you could make an exe and not make me install Java that'd be greeaat :)  Also as for the world missing out on it, how far out are you putting it for the world to find out? If someone searched for ""bulk rename tool free windows"" on Google (which is how I found ReNamer) would your app name come up at all? On /r/software you can only attract, like what ~21 users times the number of hours your post stays on the frontpage of a relatively ill visited subreddit. And is at the time they didn't need it, or didn't have Java installed to try it out :), they'll probably forget about it pretty soon. And even if they didn't, and wanted to come back to it, you know how damn well good the reddit search is. (*whispers:*not very good!:).

software,3bphbm,king_of_the_universe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:05:27 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, if you could make an exe and not make me install Java that'd be greeaat :)   The only way I know of to do that would involve blowing up the download size to 70+ MB. No install would be required, just unpacking (launch4j). As a developer, I like Java a lot, and since Minecraft and a few other notable Java games (e.g. Delver) exist, I thought it could kind of be expected that many people have Java. I'm not gonna start turning it into such an overblown EXE download, not only would nobody bite, it would also be yet another stepping stone between me and further development.   would your app name come up at all?   Well, I didn't know what to search for to find a tool like this, which (I guess) lead me to not add any keywords myself. I just now added a few keywords. Also saw that Google indeed finds that page for older keywords, so there is hope.  I made a few other posts, too, back then. I also keep mentioning it when I see a good opportunity (like here), several times a month, I'd guess.  All in all, I have made the experience that people are not very receptive to anything that comes from me, however weird that might sound. For example, I made a great replacement for the Steam game library: It automatically reads the Steam files (without altering anything), and then you can rename and tag your games (inside that program only, of course). The tag system even has a second tag system attached so that you can filter the primary tags. I have been using it ever since. It also (kind of) keeps track of your in-game time. You can sort by ""date first seen by program"" or ""date last played"" etc.. It has good data safety features (safe saves, and 100 rotating backups of the tiny but work-heavy data file), it even has a log of your activity in case you need to manually backtrack. It also shows screenshots in a useful way (as opposed to overstyled Steam), so if you click a game, you see right away what you're dealing with. Can also add custom games or programs, even links to documents. You can directly invoke install or uninstall just like from Steam, etc. I don't have a source uploaded yet, that program was before I started with online repositories.  Well. I made a few posts of this program and mentioned it in a few comments. And what I have been met with was almost no acceptance, and sometimes rejection that was borderline hostile for WTF ever reason. You know how when you go through experiences, you do learn inevitably, I mean, it's a timing and statistics thing, it's how the mind works. The tunnel through which I have gone in the last years - if anyone would go through that tunnel, they would have to come to the conclusion that they are basically singled out for some reason."

This is ok, I don't want to disable this feature, but how to wake it up with a batch file when I need it?  When I try to copy something, the batch file doesn't find the HDD path and skips all other instructions.  2: I would like to do a backup - this is very simple to do with a batch file, I can do it - and search in this backup if there are some desktop.ini files and delete them.  I found how to search, but I really don't understand how it works (parameters etc...)  thx"
software,3bqyg5,firedrow,2,Wed Jul 1 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"Does your external hdd just spin down to save power or does it actually disconnect itself (the drive letter disappears)?  If it just spins down, then the batch file would be as simple as:  CD <drive letter> DIR   That should go to your external drive and do a directory listing, which will wake up the drive.  If it actually disconnects the drive letter, then I don't know of a way in batch scripting to fix that.  Your computer is essentially losing access to the drive when it's asleep, so it can't do anything to reconnect it.  I believe you will need something stronger than a batch file for searching AND deleting the results of said search.  Now Windows comes with Powershell, and it should be able to do this. Using:  get-childitem c:\ -include desktop.ini -recurse | foreach ($_) {remove-item $_.fullname}   Change the C:\ to your chosen directory, and it will search directory and subdirectories for the desktop.ini, then delete each found item.  For this you need to open Notepad and paste the line, then save the file as a .PS1.  For your backup, you could copy and paste them while excluding files:  $source = 'd:\t1' $dest = 'd:\t2' $exclude = @('*.pdb','*.config') Get-ChildItem $source -Recurse -Exclude $exclude | Copy-Item -Destination {Join-Path $dest $_.FullName.Substring($source.length)}   Again, a PowerShell solution I found on StackOverflow"

software,3bmaa1,wrongway,2,Tue Jun 30 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"Fusion Drive is the answer here. It is way, way better than RAID-0. The operating system will automatically migrate frequently use blocks to the SSD and shift lesser used ones over to the HDD in a manner that's absolutely transparent.  Using RAID-0 is like welding a race car to a beat up old pick-up truck. It's going to perform like the slowest drive. This is only useful if you have equal-speed drives and you're desperate for performance or capacity. Normally you'd just deal with two separate drives.  Fusion is really fantastic. Highly recommended. Just remember you must back up because if you lose one of those drives, the whole thing is toast. You're exposed to twice the risk of failure with two drives. It's seamless, it behaves like one big drive that operates at SSD speeds for pretty much everything you do frequently and can store way more data than your SSD could otherwise hold.  If you want to do this, and you need space, ditch that 500MB and get a cheap 1TB drive. They're only about eighty bucks for a good one these days, often less.

Used to work for apple and one of the primary backup solutions they used was crash plan enterprise over there, and employees got a discount for personal usage. Was and am a fan of crash plan since then. I do a few test restores every 6 months and they have restored flawlessly. Use local backups as your first line of defense, it's quicker than restoring from the cloud. But if minor or major shit hits the fan then you have a reliable plan B even though it may take a tad longer to get your data downloaded. Although I have 50mbps down so it's not too bad of a wait now. First upload is typically gigabytes or terabytes of data so leave it running, eventually it will finish.

The workaround was to disable deduplication in the manner described in that link. The settings for it in the GUI does not work.  As a whole my impression of Crashplan is poor and the software is of low quality. However I have not found a cheaper alternative that runs on Linux and it does work.

software,3bfuea,mspencer712,2,Sun Jun 28 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. What's keystroke encryption software?   I mean, you press a key, it's enqueued in your keyboard ring buffer triggering an interrupt, Windows dequeues the keystroke and adds a WM_KEYDOWN message to the foreground application's message queue, and the message handler handles the message. At what point is encryption involved? If your endpoint is compromised and something else is interfering with that process, what good is encryption going to do?"
software,3bfuea,king_of_the_universe,3,Mon Jun 29 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"What's keystroke encryption software?    Uh, Software which encrypts your keystrokes. To protect them against other applications/spyware which wants to grab your input.  KeyScrambler seems a bit iffy and unstable. The fact that there is a predefined list of applications that work with it really buggs me.  I tried Zemana keystroke encryption but it does not encrypt console apps (I often use FAR manager) so I gave it up since clearly there may be more holes.  So far I am testing SpyShelter, it claims to enrypt keystrokes on kernel level. I am no computer expert but I tested it with their test tool and it seems to work well."

software,3bfuea,courey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:50:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The point I was trying to make was: if something malicious is already on your endpoint machine, it has access to input at the same or at a lower level than any key encryption software will have.    At best, this is protection against specific attacks and will be useless against attacks which are aware of this protection method.  This is evident in the ""how do I know it's working?"" FAQ entry on that site. Read reviews? Reviews can be paid for and reviewers can be incompetent. Try these public key loggers? For most people the threat model isn't software available on download.com - it's more advanced persistent threats which will have equal or higher access to the system than this product.  Absolute snake oil. Secure your endpoint instead."
software,3bfuea,mspencer712,2,Mon Jun 29 12:14:34 2015 UTC,"Endpoint here, endpoint there...Did you know that 99% of keyloggers does not work on kernel level? I do not like Keyscrambler, but let's have a talk about SpyShelter now. I am testing SpyShelter now with commercial keyloggers and even if I allow a keylogger through, SpyShelter still scrambles the text and keylogger get's useless shit instead of log file. Needless to say, keystroke encryption is just an addition in it.   What's your opinion on it? I am evaluating free trial, it doesn't require registration or anything, plain oldschool installer."
software,3bfuea,courey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"I'm at work now and have discussed this with a security-minded co-worker. (We're both programmers making banking software.) I'm willing to concede that keystroke encryption might be of some use for a very limited use case, for only as long as malware hasn't learned to defeat it.  Please remember that security threats evolve over time. Fundamentally a keystroke has to be processed by the computer at some point, which makes it susceptible to interception.  Think of it this way: it's easy to make a ""key logger"" that just calls SetWindowsHookEx() and asks Windows to deliver a copy of every keystroke to the callback function it registers. That's likely what this keystroke encryption software is designed to protect against.  Before that keystroke is dispatched as a Windows message it's enqueued in a hardware ring buffer and handled by a system interrupt handler. This interrupt handler could be replaced by malicious code, and no keystroke encryption software could prevent this without claiming to be able to block all root kits. Claiming 99% of key loggers don't do this today is little comfort against what they'll be doing tomorrow or next month.  After the keyboard message is delivered to the application message loop (after being intercepted by the encryption program and replaced with decrypted data) it is processed by application-specific code that your encryption program cannot control. Will that data be copied into a string buffer unencrypted? Will it be stored in a System.Security.SecureString object if it's .NET? Are you sure your malware won't have application-specific code for your specific build of your favorite program and be able to intercept your data anyway?   Ultimately if you think you can have an infected endpoint, and be safe from having your data stolen by bad software running on that endpoint because of good software running on that endpoint, you are gambling with your security.  I recommend securing the endpoint from being able to run malicious software instead. Use trusted software sources and keep your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date. If it can't run, it can't act against you."
software,3bfuea,downloadfeast,2,Mon Jun 29 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you, My endpoint is secure.   The thing about modern encryption software is that it works deep down on kernel level and even if you are highly infected, the encryption process will take place before keyloggers grab anything - that is in case of SpyShelter.   This is very useful to work when there is a high risk of getting yourself infected with a 0day keylogger, especially in the bank.  As for the antivirus software, I do not trust it at all. One of the reason being - it is just a business that doesn ot have anything to do with real security. All those fancy words: internet security, endpoint security, real time shield...blah, blah. 99% of antivirus users doesn't even know what 0-day threat is, because they bundle up antiviruses with almost every prebuilt PC and laptop and give people the illusion of safety.  I recall that a while ago SpyShelter posted a video with antiviruses failing against simple keylogger: https://www.spyshelter.com/blog/should-anti-keylogger-be-reviewed-as-anti-virus/  I have not heard about any commercial or non commercial keylogger that would be able to bypass SpyShelter.

You can download all your files if you want to do it that way, or opt to buy a hard drive with your data on it. For $189, you can have 4tb of your data shipped to you on a hard drive you then own, which is the route I went. You can select which files you want on it as well, which is nice. I think this is the drive they sent over, which is $129 by itself, so $60 to save all my files and not have the hassle of downloading it was nice.  Only downside is using the Backblaze downloader to restore files. It's a TON better than downloading files from a browser, and does autoresume and a lot of other useful things. I'd rather have a regular FTP access, but it works in a pinch. Probably have to break things up if you restored 4tb unless you want to unzip a 4tb file though."

software,3bb79i,r0ck0,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:57:37 2015 UTC,Probably not a big deal. I just wanted to know of the alternatives.
software,3bb79i,brennok,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I've researched this a bit.  But you need to give us some details...   Big/small files? Big files with big changes? Big files with small changes? Few changes? etc... One or multiple sources? Do you need client side encryption? OSes required? Does it truly need to be unlimited, or can you roughly estimate the most you're going to need over the next couple of years?  Chances are that better backup systems will be appearing in the next few years, so trying to find ""the best unlimited"" system right now might be a waste of time, and even lead you to compromise on other more important factors for the near future. Full version history needed? Better yet, just tell us exactly what you're doing if you want the most appropriate suggestions.  If it's just downloaded video torrents or something, just say that.  I don't think the cyber-police and going to knock down your door based on a reddit post.  Although if they do, consequences will never be the same.   When you say ""unlimited"" - do you mean for a fixed price?  CrashPlan is the only decent one I know that offers that.  But as I mentioned above, you might have more important requirements."
software,3bb79i,brennok,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for offering help.  Let's start with sizes of files. Plenty of large files (BD remxes, so 30-50GB each), OS images (compressed, say 5-10GB range), all the way down to tiny, compressible text (word documents, source code, etc.).    One source would probably be fine. I'd like to backup my server which is itself a combination of backups for my desktop and a media server. I'll start with more critical files (which are the smaller files thankfully) as it'll be a lot to backup.    Total size if I'm not going to go unlimited, with room for the next few years, I want to say 10TB. Again, I'll start with the small stuff because it's going to take a long time. I know it's a long process, but the peace of mind of an extra backup would be nice. I had multiple TBs on Crashplan a few years back.    I would like client-side encryption.  Windows support is fine.  I would like version history, but I feel safe skimping here to save a buck. My frequently changing files will be backed up elsewhere as well."
software,3bb79i,brennok,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Were you not using backup sets with Crashplan? I currently backup over 20TBs without an issue, but I use sets to keep the overall size per backup down. Also this is on a Synology that is limited to 3GBs of ram."
software,3bb79i,derekvof,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"No, I wanted all of my shit backed up. I wanted set and forget. And that fucking client ate RAM like a motherfucker. The official workaround per Crashplan themselves was to keep throwing RAM at its Java VM.   How do you set your backup sets to get around this? I would love to have Crashplan again. They gave me literally everything I wanted but a working client."
software,3bb79i,GeekTNT,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"Under settings, click Enable sets. Then go from there. You can name each set and specify which folders fall under the set. The best part is you can put the sets in order of priority so the most important files are first. You can also then tweak the settings per set as far as frequency and verification on files.   Crashplan requires more memory based off the number of files so breaking it into sets helps reduce this. I found about 1TB sets works best with low memory though you still want around 3GB allocated for CrashPlan."
software,3bb79i,GeekTNT,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:57:53 2015 UTC,So then it only does one set at a time? That might help then. I had well over 3TB and it was just past the limits of the client.
software,3bb79i,DonManuel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:09:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it finishes each set before moving on. Depending on the size of the set you want to make sure you tweak the new version frequency along with verification otherwise it will keep stopping at the designated time to go back and verify the sets. I would also consider staggering the verification.
software,3bb79i,neshi3,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"That sounds doable. It'd take an ungodly long time to finish my backup (like literally two years...) but if I could make sure my most important stuff was backed up and just work on some less important stuff when it gets to it, that might just be perfect."

software,3barh9,israellopez,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:18:05 2015 UTC,"Our issues with accountants have been that, to a large extent, they had been used to dealing with systems that they feed. Starting from the up ground we made them get back to basics in a complicated accounting environment. This was back breaking but within a few short weeks we felt where all the pain was and began to heal them. This sounds a lot like re-inventing the wheel but our experience was that typical approaches to the problem, though being sleek in some aspects, hindered flexibility. We kept things flexible and consistent. We can handle tax fine even between companies with complicated relationships."
software,3barh9,talammadi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:11:50 2015 UTC,"way we did things   Old habits are hard to break :) or is your work-flow superior to what is supported by accounting software?   I noticed that FrontAccounting allows me to skip a lot of useless (for us) steps and still get everything done properly.  BTW, we do not mess around with cheques like they do in US (are they still sending paper cheques to each other as a payment?)   Because all payments are transfers to and from our bank account, I think I am going to import all the transactions with relevant information and then make sure that we got all transactions in correct accounts.   I have edit csv anyway.    Probably much easier than starting to screw around with Gnucash export/import and what not."
software,3barh9,r0ck0,2,Sun Jun 28 09:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not an expert on the subject, but I did spend A LOT of time trying out open source accounting programs, I was especially looking for something web based, but tried many normal GUI programs too.  Gave up in the end.  Didn't find anything that worked well enough.  For a ""lazy programmer"" who likes interfaces to be as fast and effective to use as possible, including automating things that shouldn't need to be done manually, it's amazing how difficult most interfaces are to use (this isn't limited to open source).  And what's really surprising is that most accounting programs can't even categorize transactions in bulk, including gnucash.  You have to do one transaction at at time.  What the fuck?  In the end for my personal finances at least, which includes contracting, I ended up just hacking together my own thing in php/mysql.  It automatically does most things using regexs on transaction descriptions, and scrapes my bank accounts with selenium.  I also have a company, and for that I needed something more substantial that would be compliant with government rules in my country, and that an accountant could use etc.  The accountant thing is important if you'll ever be using one.  They're not going to be interested in using some accounting system they've never heard of or used.  And you probably don't want to pay them their high hourly rate to learn new shit either.   It's just not worth it for a business, as much as I hate using anything closed source at all.  I really wanted to go open source so that I controlled the database, but gave up there too in the end.    For my company I ended up using: https://saasu.com/features/ (they have inventory by the looks)  Also on the gnucash exporting thing.  It does support mysql, so you can convert your file from a regular .gnucash to a mysql based one.  From there you can do whatever you like with a bit of mysql scripting."

Not much good for spying, really. Very good for keeping track of all the equipment and supporting it when there's a problem.   How much access does Kaseya give you to one's personal files?   If you're connected to a domain, then they already have absolute access.    All we do is use the office wifi, how is that justified   It's on a work network and they have to protect themselves. Laptops are quite scary in an IT context. They go outside the confines of the safe, controlled network to places unknown and pick up god only knows what malware.

For removing crapware and shitty programs you don't want, I recommend Revo Uninstaller. edit: /u/StarfleetAdmiral makes some good points. Don't delete reg keys haphazardly without abandon. This can fuck your shit up. In terms of quick bootups, unless the program is designed specifically for your motherboard or other hardware, stay the fuck away from it. It can't and won't help. edit: /u/StarfleetAdmiral makes another good point. If you get a program that will go through and remove startup programs, that will of course work. Revo uninstaller is capable of this. For a multimedia player, you'll want VLC  for virus protection, you'll want microsoft security essentials. do not download Avast!, AVG, or anything like that. Anyone who recommends those programs is an idiot and does not understand that they are adware, pure and simple. If you ever get into a serious virus situation, you'll want NPE (norton power eraser). It's one .exe file (no install) you can run off a usb device and will scan and remove crap very efficiently, however, it can damage some other software (very aggressive) For ""internet security"" you'll want common sense and maybe Google Chrome. edit: A number of people have suggested an ad blocker can help with a lack of common sense. I recommend one as well.    Be wary of the download pages and installers for CCleaner and Revo, and possibly VLC. They will try and fool you into installing excess shitty adware.

But to be a bit more specific, "".mp4"" and "".avi"" are pretty much meaningless. You can think of them as ""zip files"" and ""rar files"" containing ""audio files"" and ""video files"". The format of the audio and video is probably more important. For example, an MP4 container typically has H.264 or MPEG-4 video, and AAC or AC3 audio. An AVI container typically has other things, but I don't know because I don't have that many of those files. So you need to know the audio and video codecs your TV supports, not just the container. See Wikipedia for a detailed list of what containers can have what a/v codecs. If your TV can support AVI with H.264 + AAC, and your MP4 file just happens to have those codecs, you might be able to just ""transcode"" it - copy the audio and video as is from one container to another - e.g.: ffmpeg -i original.mp4 -c copy transcoded.avi.  And if your TV understands the DLNA protocol, you can run PS3 Media Server on your computer, and it will probably handle the messy transcoding details for you."

software,3ap2f4,frothface,2,Mon Jun 22 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of ""awhile"" I suppose, but my anecdotal experience with 3 Lenovos and a Dell which support this feature disagrees.  The oldest of this group, a venerable Lenovo T61p bought in 2007, lives on in the possession of a friend. It will be turning 8 years old this year. It has been used daily, rarely turned off, and plugged into a wall socket for much of its life. It is still using the original battery, set to charge to between 60-70%. It still has nearly full battery capacity to this day and can last just under 2 hours to shutdown when starting around 70%. It does get in a full charge or discharge occasionally, but rarely. I used to charge it to full before road trips etc. None of the other batteries show any sign of wear either.  On the other hand, over the same timeframe and with similar usage and treatment, 2 Apples, 1 Acer, and 2 MSI laptops have all shown significant battery life degradation being constantly stuck at 95%+ charge, with both Apples needing new batteries completely after only 2.5 years, and the Acer in pretty bad shape probably also needing to be replaced.  In today's culture of disposable electronics, it makes no sense for manufacturers to optimize for long term durability when they could instead tweak an extra 30 minutes or out of the battery at the cost of lifespan. People don't buy laptops based on how long the battery will survive before replacement. Not ever. There isn't even a trustworthy way to measure that. People, to a small extent, DO buy laptops based on battery runtime though. Either way, once they've bought the laptop, the sooner the battery fails, the more likely the customer will be ""encouraged"" to replace the whole laptop with a newer model. At the very least, they'll probably buy a new ""official"" battery marked up to ridiculous prices. It's naive to believe companies don't plan for exactly this kind of thing, they do."

It's almost like Microsoft took a look at your software and like, copied it. Anyone from /r/conspiracy want to chime in?  Anyway, one of the functions of this lesser known button is that if you press it again, your window goes back. Isn't that amazing?!

No internet connection required, as well as Adobe account - though you can have a nice 30 day (or 60 day if you're lucky) trial with an Adobe account, which is used to install it and that's it. You can log off as soon as you open it for the first time. Not needed to be online at all, you can even activate if by phone when you buy it. Or if you go by subscription model, if that's your thing, in the Creative Cloud thingy Adobe has been doing, you only need to be online once every 30 days to keep it working. Absolutely nothing goes to the cloud, it only checks your subscription status. You can opt-in for the settings to go into the cloud, that's nice so you can get them when you reinstall it somewhere else if you need to or restore Windows, etc.  Get the trial for your dad and see how he likes it. If he enjoys it, get a subscription (I guess it's cheaper than buying it) and what you get it's the exact same desktop offline program, the same as if you bought it lifetime.

Yeah it might be a pain to type but really you are just putting in your complex password twice. Obviously I made up the passwords above but I hope I get the point across.  In all fairness I do not go into my vault very often. I let LastPass create my passwords and just forget them. Every place I make a password for, I bookmark it, so I have that list. Best practice is you should be using something unique for every site you go to. Best practice also says you should have a phrase or sentence that is beyond unique to you and for you to modify it.  There is also something else I say to everyone when it comes to passwords. Its not a matter of ""if"" its crackable but ""when"".

software,39y8wi,matty348,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"You must not understand encryption and salting then. Right in the news blog by LastPass   LastPass strengthens the authentication hash with a random salt and 100,000 rounds of server-side PBKDF2-SHA256, in addition to the rounds performed client-side.   Even with the salts, not only would the decryption take beyond years, the attackers would have to string together billions or CPU's to get the MILS to crack even one hash.  Think of it like this. Someone uses as standard 8 character password. At SHA256 we are talking about a 8256 * 100,000*2 hash. Then it was salted with a random number (but since that was compromised, and even then we do not know if it was taken as well, we will ignore the salt). So all in all, it would take more than 5 years to decrypt just one hash. So yeah, the data that they took was pretty much pointless. The only thing that I am more concerned over is they have my email address."

If yes, put it into your computer and check its contents in the Windows File Explorer. This is an example content of a DVD directory structure.

software,39vbm5,jaredcheeda,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:07:09 2015 UTC,"Well you can either get them something like a PBO Core or WDTV and just copy the files over which will likely be cheaper and easier in the long run. You'll just need to train them on how to switch the INPUT on the TV to it and how to navigate the interface to watch movies. But this would let you hook up an external hard drive with tons of movies on it. I got my mom the PBO Core a few years ago, there are two screws on the back that let you slide the case off and easily insert a laptop hard drive. From there You can just copy whatever files you want onto it from either an external device or over the network and they playback right from the internal hard drive, no streaming required.  Alternatively, you'll need to convert your H.264 encoded videos over to MPG-2 for DVD. I'm not familiar with dvdflick, but most DVD burning/creating software can transcode common video wrappers/codecs to DVD format for you. Though they usually don't recognize MKV.   Adobe Encore (Professional DVD Authoring/Creation/Burning) Windows DVD Maker (Simplified DVD Authoring/Creation/Burning) Adobe Media Encoder (Professional Video Conversion) Format Factory (Video Converter of multiple formats) XMedia Recode (Video Converter of multiple formats) SUPER (Video Converter of any format, though difficult to obtain and use) Handbrake (Convert Video from common filetypes to H.264 MP4 or MKV)   You make need to convert them to MPG2 first before DVD creation software can recognize the file.  Basic terminology:   Wrapper: AVI, MOV, MPG, MKV, etc. Codec: H.263, H.264, DivX, XviD, Theora, etc.   A wrapper is the filetype (move.avi), and inside the file is the video, audio, and other features. These are encoded using codecs. DVD's require VOB files encoded as MPEG-2. But you shouldn't have to do that by hand. You should just find out what video filetype the DVD software accepts and then convert your files to that. It will then convert them to DVD format and build the disc contents. I recommend burning it as an image (.iso file) so that way you can just burn the image to the disc and not have to reconvert your files again in the future. And if there's an error where it can't finish the disc and ejects you can just try again with the image, instead of having to re-produce the contents. This all depends on the type of DVD creation/burning software you're using.  DVD Image Burning Software:   ImgBurn CDBurnerXP InfraRecorder   A Lot of the software I mentioned here is available via Liberkey for free as portable software. I suggest starting there, as most common purpose software is available through Liberkey."

software,39obds,cmd-t,-6,Sat Jun 13 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for the advice, but I don't think I have a gambling addiction.  I play music for a living and often play casinos, plenty of opportunities to gamble there, but I rarely ever do except occasionally with the rest of my band as a social thing.  About once or twice a year I make a calculated trip to a casino and play blackjack.  I set a strict limit on how much I will win or lose before leaving and almost always hit my win goal, around $100 usually, and then leave.  I recently got the urge to play some poker online for fun, because my brother is a professional and is in Vegas right now playing the World Series and watching his updates made want to play.  So I deposited $100 at an online casino, but the poker software wouldn't work, so I decided to play (browser based) blackjack instead.  I have now turned that $100 into $2500 and have to wait a week before I can cash it out.  It's been so easy to go back and win more when I'm bored so I kept going back and playing.  If I had a working block here I wouldn't go to a library or anything, I'd just focus on other things.  I have a lot of computer based work to do (graphic design, web design, video editing, advertising, etc., for musical projects) but throughout the day I impulsively check my email, facebook, the local newspaper, etc - this falls into that same category.  Are people that check their email or facebook every half an hour or so ""addicted""?  I suppose you could argue that they are.  Anyway, I guess I'll have to just count on sheer willpower alone.  I go a month or two every year without drinking, so I should be able to make it through this."

software,39jz34,ignitionnight,5,Fri Jun 12 06:52:06 2015 UTC,"SSH is just a protocol for establishing a secure connection between two computers. A SSH server is a piece of software that listens on a certain port for other computers to connect, check their credentials and initiate a session. SFTP is just FTP over SSH. If your FTP performance is spotty, then SFTP performance will also be spotty, since it needs to encrypt all communication before sending. The amount of data sent remains the same.   VNC is another protocol, and sometimes tunneled through SSH or VPN, of which the latter is concidered easier to set up for windows hosts"
software,39jz34,cmd-t,3,Fri Jun 12 08:04:56 2015 UTC,"I will try to ELY5.  With SSH you can create a tube from you to another friend. Through that tube you can send words back and forth (if you open an interactive terminal) and also send big packages (files). Nobody else can see what's inside the tube.  The fact that it's so secure comes with a price: the communication is somewhat slower. If you and your friend are in the same house, it's inconvenient to speak in the tube if you want to say something secret to one another, unless you are paranoid and you thing your neighbour or the government is spying on you with bugs or something. But if you are on vacation at the Bahamas and you want to send to your friend a video of you making a fool of yourself, you can use an SSH tube to be sure that nobody else can see the video while you are sending it, and you won't be embarassed.  The SSH tube works so that, when you build it, you can tell to the other side what are we doing with that tube. If you want to connect to a terminal, it will create a terminal and you can interact with it. If you want to transfer files, it will launch an FTP server and you attach from your side an FTP client. This is done quite automatically with FTP clients like FileZilla and WinSCP, and it's not necessary to setup anything with common SSH servers like OpenSSH.  If you want to make SSH a little faster, for example if the tube is running slow through the internet, you can use the ""Blowfish algorithm"". It's a different way to build your tube, it's still secure but the transfers will go a little faster. If you don't say anything the tube will be built in another way that is crazy secure but a little slower. In WinSCP SSH settings you can rank the algorithm higher with respect to the others, so that it will be chosen first (I don't know for FileZilla).  Another way to make it easier to work with the tube is to have ""keys"" on both ends of the tube, instead of exchanging passwords. Let's say you and your friend are secret agents, and you want to know if you are really talking to your friend or to a spy. Usually you use passwords, but there are ways to ""secure"" the phones that you are talking with, by having special secret keys inside your phone and the phone of your friend, so if you ring your friend with your secure phone you can be sure that you are talking to your friend's phone, through a secure tube. You can read about the details by searching for ""SSH key setup"", for example on WinSCP pages."

I guess you mean that there's a start time and end time for a subtitle, and that's it - very simple mechanism. If so, then the subtitle should show whenever you are inside that time span.

I meant duration. Not end time. That gets the point across wrong and causes confusion. I'm sorry.
software,39cd8a,asullivanr,2,Thu Jun 11 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"Start time and duration. That makes it indeed a slightly different issue than start time and end time. Still, I would call it a bug, given that the word is being used widely in a quite loose sense anyway, because it's so hard to nail down what a bug really is. You are probably coming from the ""unintended behavior"" angle, and the code is doing what it was planned to do - but do you not yourself in other cases use the term differently?  At least that's what I am doing here: E.g. in GTA5 on PC, there was a problem with chatting interfering with the other interface buttons, which was supposedly fixed with the update a few days ago. What is a bug in your sense? The programmer coded correctly, but the code does unintended things. This can basically only happen if something outside the program, e.g. a nonstandard computer configuration with a weird behaving driver or somesuch, interferes. That is such a corner-case of a definition, making the word almost useless. Or, let's say: What term would you use for all the other ""bugs"", e.g. where the programmer didn't think correctly, but the intentions they formed were then properly put into action and also worked as intended, see e.g. the GTA5 example?  In my book, the invisibility of the subtitles at a time when they should be visible can be called a bug without raising an eye-brow."
software,39cd8a,amanitus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"I can see neither of us are going to budge on this. So lets agree to disagree at least.  I will admit i used the wrong for what I mean, but that doesn't mean a bug is a bug.  The gt5 thing is most definitely a bug. Even more so if it hurts gameplay.  I think the bug issue is that almost all subtitles use start and duration but not start/end. So it will most likely continue to work as such till subtitles are fixed. Or if VLC or someone else starts just auto interpreting an end time and starting in the middle."

Unless you have a bunch of uncompressed stuff lying around, I don't think you should be trying to re encode it, because the gains probably aren't going to be worth the quality loss and time re encoding takes.  The format you want is h.264, and if your videos were encoded in the past few years, they're probably in that format already. You wouldn't want to encode them in h.265, the codec isn't ready for general use and your devices probably can't handle it."

I only wish they'd implement learning mode and ""ask to block/allow"" popup when undefined programs try to access internet. I know there are third party programs that do this, but I believe it'd be better if this basic feature was built-in. I'm usually much more comfortable knowing, that everything but programs I allow don't have access to the internet, and creating rules manually is tiresome. On the other hand once you create your rules it's pretty easy to export and reuse after Windows re-installations."

PDF is not intended to be an editable format. There are some tools that can allow you some marginal editing capabilities. Depending on how the PDF is structured internally, what you're looking to do might be possible, but it's extremely unlikely, barring difficult time-consuming work that involves: going into the tree structures of the PDF substituting your photo and text, rebuilding the trees and associated dictionaries and hoping you didn't unhinge anything else.   You're probably going to have greater success converting the PDF pages to images, then editing the images, and reconverting them back to PDF pages. If you do this patiently with good tools, you can get your end result and it will look close to the current quality of your document."

But on the other hand commercial software is about 100 times cheaper than NASA code (I don't remember where I read that number).  If people would be willing to pay $3000 for Windows instead of $30 it would be rock solid and a Toyota price might go from $20000 HW + $500 software to $20000 HW + $50000 SW = $70000 - something the market is not willing to accept I assume.

software,384fdv,somlead,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:17:10 2015 UTC,Run software. Currently it's for capturing every word during a trial. Basically the way it's set up is the court reporter repeats every word said by everyone into his mask which has a mic in it and captures everything. It then works with word processing software to put it all down and edit it. The voice to text is dragon naturally speaking (DNS) and the word processing software is (eclipse). We are getting new assets and everyone is pushing for i7s and huge amounts of RAM (either 16 or 32gb). The people that come up with this stuff know nothing about computers are I would call them typical consumers. All they look for is the bigger numbers in cpu and ram. They don't take into consideration ram speed or hard drive read and write speeds (hopefully we will get SSDs). I just got into this job but before I wanted to open my mouth and make some recommendations I wanted to be sure on what resources would be taxed the most by the software.

But for what you're talking about, you would probably want a sensor by the door to your room to know when the door is opened or something and for the burglar scenario a security system would work wonders...

You are not doing yourself any favors. If Spotify is not your cup of tea just switch to Google music or something. Or buy the music online somewhere. But don't be a douchebag and pirate lower quality tracks just because some shitty service made you sour. If you are truly a music lover you will soon realize that YouTube is not a good music source. But at the end of the day I sure as hell can't tell you what to do.

software,37r2vg,AcceleratedCode,21,Fri May 29 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"If your computer is 92% idle and only using 7/16 GB while compiling then it's likely you are I/O (input/output) bound.  That is, the speed in which you can read and write files to the hard drive is limiting your performance.   If the drive is slow the CPU spends a lot of time waiting for it.  If you're on a iMac with a slow 5400rpm disk drive that could be the culprit (or trying to compile off a USB drive). On the other hand, if you're running a pro with an SSD then that likely isn't the issue.  The oddity in that though is the low RAM usage. Typically the OS will use all free memory to cache the hard drive data (making disk I/O irrelevant).  Alternatively it could be that xcode isn't parallelizing like it should. If I can trust the internet (I don't use xcode) Xcode should default to run as many jobs in parallel as you have physical cores.  This is configurable though. Could be you have somehow limited yourself to 1 stream which would waste a lot of CPU.  You could check that the number and modify it if need be (IDEBuildOperationMaxNumberOfConcurrentCompileTasks)"
software,37r2vg,Myrv,2,Fri May 29 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"Typically the OS will use all free memory to cache the hard drive data (making disk I/O irrelevant).   Yes, but most OSs don't actually report that memory as 'used' (or at least, they report it as 'free', which is true because it can be dropped if it's needed for something else), because it confuses users."
software,37r2vg,rcxdude,7,Sat May 30 12:04:54 2015 UTC,"While others have described the operaiton of your CPU correctly, I am going to go out on a limb and say that your real bottlneck with xcode at least is your HDD.  Unless you are using a solid state drive it's definitely slowing down your compile time.  Others are right, compiling code especially native C doesn't parallelize well.  Things you can do to speed up compile time are to manage header includes better and using friend classes in your headers while doing the real include in your .mm files.  Basically what happens when you include a header is you include every header it includes as well.  But headers usually only need to know type names so C languages have added a feature called a friend class which temporarily defines a type name until you include it in your implementation file!  That what when your header is parsed ONLY the header is parsed.  It lowers the compile time cost of your header files by a ton.  In xcode I think it convinces you to use single files for definitions and implementations I believe which means every time you include a header somewhere it gets parsed unless it's still in scope from a parent class.  Another thing you can do is split your code into several modules rather than 1 with LIMITED DEPENDENCIES.  I.E. you have a util project that has your XML tools and UI code etc.  Split each individual set of things out into a seperate project.  This makes compiling parallelizeable.  Your IDE (at least visual studio) will be able to build down through seperate projects simultaneously if you plan your project structure right.  Projects whose dependencies are built whom aren't dependent on eachother will build in parallel.  really though, faster HDD, reading all that text off disk takes time."

software,37r2vg,Centropomus,4,Thu Jun 4 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Compiling code tends to be a very linear process (since each step depends on the output of the step before it), and thus doesn't tend to parallelize very well. Basically, your computer has a list of (probably billions) of instructions it needs to run through to generate the compiled executable, but can't mess around (very much) with the order it runs them, so is left to basically run them one after the other as fast as possible (which will only use some of the available CPU / memory your system has available, since your computer can run multiple instructions at once in most cases)."
software,37r2vg,Inquisitor1,5,Fri May 29 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"Think of the task as a list of things to do, one after another.  And imagine yourself as the computer running this task.  You look at the first thing to do, do it, then look at the second, and do it, and so on and so forth.  The only resources you have at your disposal are a pad of paper, a filing cabinet, and your brain.  The instructions will tell you when to use the pad of paper and filing cabinet, and the speed at which your brain works is set in stone.  There is no way for you to execute this set of instructions in any different manner than what you're already doing.  This set of instructions is the software, and its also set in stone at the time the software maker turns their code into executable software.  One thing that is possible for certain tasks, is to run them in parallel.  Essentially, imagine that you have two brains and the instructions say to run two different sets of instructions on each brain.  This would run faster on two brains than one, but only if the software maker wrote the software to take advantage of two brains."

software,37r2vg,HandshakeOfCO,-1,Fri May 29 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"Also, not all algorithms are more efficient the more RAM you have, or the available RAM couldn't suffice for data-intensive operations (i.e. searching a database).  In practice, what usually happens is that badly written applications consume too much memory and remove the available memory for other apps. It's worse when they don't give back all the memory they took (this is known as memory leak). And when there's not enough memory, the computer starts doing something called swapping (temporarily storing part of the RAM in the hard drive). This swapping makes your computer slow as molasses, and it's one of the reasons why increasing your available memory is sometimes much more efficient than buying a faster CPU.  But no matter how much memory you got, your app can't be faster than the number of cores your CPU got. That'd be akin to giving an employee more space in the office to sort a bunch of papers; as long as it's only one employee, there's a limit to how fast he can go."
software,37r2vg,veblfnso,2,Fri May 29 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"While this is true, it should be noted that modern processors can execute multiple instructions at the same time through pipelining, as long as an instruction doesn't depend on a previous instruction.  So, for this code:  add eax, 5 add ebx, 7   A CPU could start executing the second instruction before the first has finished. But for this:  add eax, 5 add abx, eax   The CPU would have to wait for the first instruction to finish before it can start the second."

This is why Microsoft has developer programs and releases beta versions of the OS. When Windows 7 was announced, it was perfectly acceptable and desirable to continue releasing software designed for Vista. Then, as beta versions of Windows 7 are released, you can test your software with it before the final version is released to the public. Otherwise, you are holding off your software for months unnecessarily. Whether to release patches to add support for Windows 7 is a business decision at that point, but is generally desired by users."

From a financial perspective, you go with option #2, since a large portion of your client base will not run Windows 7 on day one.  Many corporations still have huge installations of Windows XP.  You will have months or years before you will see major negative impact on targeting versions of Windows prior to 7.  As to your questions:   This is totally unacceptable.  Windows announces their OS releases years in advance, and any company spending billions on a product will have access to early releases of Windows 7 (years in advance). The only Pro to option 1 is that you will have some users who are dissatisfied with an accidental install of a product on Windows 7.  This can be prevented at install time, but not at purchase time.  From a financial perspective, option 1 is pretty much dumb. Don't fuck up your technical requirements. This is a really naive ""problem"".

Also, unless something has DRASTICALLY changed in the operating system (aka windows xp to vista) then the changes that would need to be made would be minor and could be easily applied with an update.

If it's a quick and straightforward process, then a small delay might be acceptable -- or give early adopters the possibility to upgrade to the Win7-compatible version when it's available.

IOW: ""Good"" scanners detect viruses which are roughly one year old. I have better suggestions, based on my experiences:     You're using Windows 8, the second-most secure operating system (measured by the number of exploit mitigation techniques) behind OpenBSD. This means you're probably largely unaffected by one of the most common malware types. This leads us to ... The two other major malware breaching holes are e-mail (can easily be filtered with a server-side spam filter) and JavaScript holes in modern browsers. The latter one is annoying, but I'd recommend you to use Firefox or SeaMonkey with the NoScript add-on, basically allowing you to whitelist pages to use JavaScript.     Of course you can still be paranoid, like: ""what if a malware comes with an unknown USB device?"". Actually, Windows's UAC should avoid damage as user-side applications usually can't access critical system directories, but you might still want to have some kind of a virus scanner running just so you can sleep even better at night. In this case, just use Microsoft's Windows Defender (comes with Windows 8). Of course it does not have a ""perfect"" detection rate; but at least it does not open additional potential holes on your system."

It does require you have a newer Nvidia graphic's card though, so if you don't have a GTX 600 or newer you can't use it. It also is restricted to LAN. Not the case apparently, but probably recommended. Edit - Doesn't have voicechat but can be supplemented with a secondary program (Skype for example) if needed.

Most of their servers are Windows 2k3 (XP server)  Most banks are running on Windows 2k3.  People would be shocked to see what platforms your every day financial transactions are really occurring on.
software,35ya5d,darkempath,2,Thu May 14 17:09:31 2015 UTC,I know this. You are right too. Too many institutions are staying with XP and 2k3 because software won't run on anything newer. Software vendors need to keep up but the problem is there is a lack of even halfway competent developers to fill the need.   At the place I work we run Server 2k3 on about 30 or so servers. They run both the financial systems and the computer aided dispatch software for 911. We are working on replacing both as we speak but we won't make the June deadline when 2k3 retires.

Yes, imagine that... it's almost as if time was... sorta... moving unidirectionally forwards without caring. Extended support for win7 will run out in 2020, for win8 in 2023, and who knows when extended support for win10 will run out (probably like 2025), you should be able to deal with upgrading your virtualized systems in the next 5-10 years. Since they are virtualized, that makes that even easier, just create an image with the important stuff and throw it on there...   We are doing just fine on XP, thanks for your concern.    Well, quite evidently you are not, hence why you are here. But the serious trouble will start when you are lacking important security updates which make your systems vulnerable.

software,35hfsl,kickinespresso,1 point,Sun May 10 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome, you got the main point of what I'm looking for.  The idea is that I will start the counter, and then draw, it will keep adding the amount of pixels traveled across to the total amount until I stop the counter. Since a drawing or painting requires many strokes it needs to add the new strokes length to the counter. So a ""start recording"" and ""stop recording"" button would be needed.  Converting would require some input boxes to provide data for the conversion. A tablet has the same ratio and resolution as the screen, but smaller size overall. So a 24"" 1920x1080 screen would have a dpi of 92 while the tablet at 6.8"" would have a dpi of 323. In the end the conversion would need to know the size of the monitor, the resolution of the monitor and the size of the tablet. And then do the math to output the distance the pen traveled physically. A inch on the actual tablet would be 3.5 inches on the screen.  I'm not good enough at math to figure out the conversion formula easily (why I'm an artist). So if you don't want to do that bit that's alright. All I really need is the final amount of pixels traveled over time when the counter is stopped.  Thanks for the effort so far. Ask any time if you need art or graphics of any kind."
software,35hfsl,kickinespresso,1 point,Sun May 10 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, that changes the game a little bit. So instead of the distance between two points, you want the distance traveled during 1 stroke? And then when you add more strokes, it should continue to track the distance traveled? So, in this diagram, you're looking for the distance traveled between points C and D in Fig A, rather than the distance between points A and B. Correct?   And the next part is then to track the distance traveled for all strokes after you hit a record button? So, as in Figure B, you're looking for stroke 1 (distance travelled between A & B) + stroke 2 (distance travelled between C & D). Is this correct?"
software,35hfsl,sketxz,1 point,Mon May 11 12:29:04 2015 UTC,"both sounds correct. A painting or drawing on a graphic tablet consists of a LOT of strokes, and no stroke are straight from A to B, but rather like arcs most of the time.  I wouldnt be surprised if a painting can contain as many as 1000 or more strokes."

software,35gaay,Kingdud,6,Sun May 10 13:09:48 2015 UTC,"FYI, the program that things like handbrake all use is ffmpeg. Also, MKV is a container, not a file type. The codec you use to encode the data you put into the MKV is more important than the MKV itself. For example, I can make an MKV with the H264 codec, or the divx codec, and both would end with and be valid MKVs. But you'd need two different codecs to play them.  ffmpeg has a windows version, but is entirely CLI based. If you want to encode ~a file~ to an h264 MKV at a quality similar you'd get if you downloaded a movie, this would be the command line: ffmpeg -i input.MOV -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -level 4.1 -preset slow -tune film -c:a flac -q:a 100 output.mkv  If you wanted to also resize the video: ffmpeg -i input.MOV -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -level 4.1 -preset slow -tune film -sws_flags lanczos -c:a flac -q:a 100 -vf scale=800:-1 output.mkv  In the second example, 800:-1 means 'resize to be 800 pixels wide and change the height pixels to whatever is needed to match the aspect ratio of the input source'. If you gave a 1920x1080 input video to that command, with -vf scale=1280:-1 the final video would be 1280x720 (720p) because 720 maintains aspect ratio."

I don't know if you have to use the existing install to run that app or not, tbqh.  I did, but I don't know if it's required.  One important thing is to make sure you match the version of windows that came with the license.  Look for the Microsoft sticker - if it reads ""Win 8 Pro"" then use the Pro version, if it just reads ""Win 8"" then use the not-Pro version.

I only had a ""limited"" copy because I wasn't upgrading from another system, which I had to call Microsoft to have them unlock it.

I don't have anywhere near the technical expertise to make it work though aside from just pointing my phone at the screen and crossing my fingers lol  Here's a link to an article about the app I'm talking about: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2015/jan/16/google-translate-new-app-new-york-video  If you combined that with some kind of screen viewing application, it WOULD work but I would have no idea how to do that.  It's a good place to start though.  Emulate the application on your PC then feed a screenview to the emulated application's video feed.  Of course you would have to remember that everything you highlighted was in another language and was only VISUALLY being translated...
