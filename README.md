# reddit-comment-scraper
Scrape just the comments from as many Reddit pages as possible.
All output should contain the number of upvotes, if available, and the text of the comment.

TO DO
-----
* Figure out why the fuck the scrapers stop early for some of the subreddits. That should never happen!
* Generate a proof-of-concept dataset
* Set up script to parse the comment data and feed it to python w2v
* (Optional) Set up additional data from wikipedia or something
* Make project for w2v training and neural net for proof-of-concept dataset
