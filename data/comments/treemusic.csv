treemusic,3dltrt,GeminiVI,3,Fri Jul 17 18:05:34 2015 UTC,Decent.  it's far far more electronic.   It's more synth pop than psych rock.  I think it's a good album.  But i don't think the world needed yet another synth pop record.
treemusic,3dltrt,letstalkthings1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:24:42 2015 UTC,Aww. Bummer. What should I be listening to?
treemusic,3dltrt,GeminiVI,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"The album is definitely far more electronic, and straight up dives into disco, R&B, and synthpop (which I'm absolutely loving). If you're looking for a more ""traditional"" Tame Impala sound from the album, I would suggest listening to ""Eventually"" and ""Cause I'm A Man"". ""Nangs"" is also fucking awesome, albeit a short listen."
