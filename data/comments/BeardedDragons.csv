BeardedDragons,3e4j03,auryncharm,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't understand the appeal of loose substrate.  The beardie's are pretty much living in a giant litter box with it.  It holds bacteria, parasites (if the beardie may be carrying any which can lead to an outbreak), and it retains moisture which can raise humidity leading to respiratory issues as well as allowing the growth of mold.  Having tile or non-adhesive shelf liner is so much easier to keep clean and disinfect, just spray and wipe.  It's also a lot cheaper than constantly having to buy and replace loose substrate."
BeardedDragons,3e4j03,lovethewebs,0,Wed Jul 22 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"I asked yesterday, apparently theres no loose substrate :(.  So only Tile/Reptile Carpet is good...  To make my habitat the best it could be I use sand but I dont do the feeding inside the habitat and bring them to a separate one with reptile carpet/"
BeardedDragons,3e42y9,Sam3323,3,Tue Jul 21 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Buying in bulk will be the easiest and most cost effective option. You can find websites that sell feeders for whatever you're after, and will ship them to your door or local post office (if temperatures are dangerous for the feeders) and most will offer a live guarantee. Some places will offer a subscription type plan, you will just have to check around and see.   If properly cared for, depending on the feeder, you can safely order larger amounts and keep them long enough to feed off. Before you get into ordering crickets in bulk, I will tell you that they can be an absolute pain to keep. They escape easily, smell awful, make noise, and are much more fragile in terms of keeping them alive. You can make things much easier on yourself by choosing another feeder.   Back on topic, the amount you would order will just depend on how much your dragon will eat, and how long you can keep them alive/appropriate sized. You should also account for die offs, just in case. So if your dragon eats 40 small roaches daily, that amounts to 280 per week, and 560 for two weeks respectively. Using this example, if it were me, I would probably order 600 roaches at first to see how long it would last me. This gives me extras to account for any that may die (though feeder orders usually include an overcount), and for days that the dragon might be interested in eating more.   I find that ordering smaller amounts more frequently, either when you are new to online feeder delivery or trying new prey, is easier at first until you can get settled into a routine. Once you're comfortable with how long smaller amounts will last you, you can better account for larger orders.   Either way, just my thoughts on the subject. Hope it helps."

Once all the eggs have formed in the ootheca, she will pull it back in until the nymphs hatch out and she gives live birth."

BeardedDragons,3e1blk,Deicid1,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:37 2015 UTC,Just a quick reminder since you have a water dish. Its hard for beardies to see non moving objects sometimes (like water) so you water bowls are sometimes useless for some beardies while other may learn that theres water. You'll want to hydrate them by spraying their heads with water.
BeardedDragons,3e1blk,lovethewebs,3,Tue Jul 21 06:11:24 2015 UTC,"Looks nice, though I would recommend mounting the UVB fixture inside the tank if you can to ensure your new guy is soaking up as much as he can."

BeardedDragons,3dwol7,Lobos42,5,Mon Jul 20 15:03:31 2015 UTC,You really shouldn't be feeding your beardie hissers.  They have a chemical in their bodies than is numbing and potentially toxic when ingested in large quantities.

BeardedDragons,3dtgey,NathanSurvey,4,Sun Jul 19 11:22:48 2015 UTC,"Most common cause is being housed with other hatchlings that are all underfed.  Usually they just nip tails, but limbs aren't all that uncommon."
BeardedDragons,3dtgey,I_am_a_Wookie_AMA,3,Sun Jul 19 13:37:49 2015 UTC,That's what I assumed happened as well. I got Stumpy at a yard sale when he was about 3 so his limbs were long gone.
BeardedDragons,3dtgey,CiDee,2,Sun Jul 19 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"Aww, what a big fella! Question, how do you know he's blind? Cataracts or something else? And how long has he been blind for? I'm just curious, as I've never really heard much about beardies going blind."
BeardedDragons,3dtgey,CiDee,3,Sun Jul 19 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"I slowly noticed him struggling to find his food at first. It's so bad now that I have to hand feed him, give him water through a syringe and put him back on his basking log because he can't find any of it. Still is very active at least.

BeardedDragons,3dtgey,axolotlaxolotl,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:38 2015 UTC,The way he acts. I'll take him out to run around a bit but usually ends up running head first into a wall.
BeardedDragons,3dwqp4,_Tebro,3,Mon Jul 20 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"I'd feed him as many crickets as he can eat.  This has less to do with you being gone for several days and more to do with the fact that juvies should be eating a ton!  General rule of thumb is as many crickets as they will eat in 15 minutes.   If he is aa juvie still, he'll be growing a ton and can use all the extra nutrients he can get.    And it never hurts to spoil a beardy :p"

Could just be a fast grower though. Does he eat a ton? You'll know if he's not a regular dragon if he starts pushing 2'+ body length. My friend's dragon has a nearly 30"" body alone. Over 40"" including the tail. The thing is a fucking monster and one of the sweetest dragons you could meet"
BeardedDragons,3dvpvs,merlyn923,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:56:55 2015 UTC,He is a big baby he loves my dogs too. God forbid I clean his tank and forget his blanket and pillow he throws a temper tantrum.  The guy I got him from is a neighbor and said his dad is huge no idea on if he's g.g or not. He saw him a few months ago and kept saying how big he is. He used to eat tons but now he's slowed down. Super picky eater too.
BeardedDragons,3dvpvs,drklrdpcky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's bullshit man. The largest beardie on record is like 28 inches, including tail.  Post proof of a 40 inch dragon, otherwise I'm calling BS."
BeardedDragons,3dvpvs,merlyn923,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:49:39 2015 UTC,I'm talking nose to tail. Never actually measure him myself but he looked like he was ~3' total.
BeardedDragons,3dvpvs,drklrdpcky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:33:57 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a German giant anymore.  The bloodline was watered down to the point of being functionally obsolete, as people became more focused on color than size.  People use it as an excuse to sell a big beardie, but there's no longer any genetic basis for it."

We use a normal carpet style substrate and he's been in no contact with other animals. He has eaten crickets in the past and hasn't been receptive to vegetables. He's been eating and drinking medicated food and water/pedialyte out of syringes  No pics bc Tyrone is at my girlfriends right now. Also, we are not cohabitating."
BeardedDragons,3dvacn,chasingcars825,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:11 2015 UTC,Is he alert or sleeping all the time?
BeardedDragons,3dvacn,chasingcars825,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:13:34 2015 UTC,He's sleeping all the time.  He will wake up if you move him around and he does crawl around on your hand if you move it but that's about it. He almost instantly goes to sleep once he stops
BeardedDragons,3dvacn,chasingcars825,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:49 2015 UTC,"I had a beardie like this, he had some sort of genetic defect. He was always small and we think his heart couldnt pump blood to his brain effectively to keep him conscious. He couldnt chase crickets and sadly he just stopped waking up.   All of that to say, if he has a similar problem he may not have a blood pressure sufficient to keep him awake. You are doing everything right with the pedialyte and syringe feedings. If the rx food is chunky, do thin it with the pedialyte to reduce the risk of him aspirating a chunk into his airway. Gerber baby food squash and green beans are also good for variety. How much does he weigh?"
BeardedDragons,3dvacn,xxDeeJxx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:17 2015 UTC,"He's very tiny. About 5"" long. I'd guess a quarter pound. He looks really skinny too, although I'm not sure if I'm just noticing this now bc I'm worried"

BeardedDragons,3dv47q,EpitaphREI,3,Sun Jul 19 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"No matter how good you cleaned there could still be fungus spores. Bleach, steam, nothing really kills it 100%. It can also be in any nooks and crannies. Anything that a dragon with YF touches really should be destroyed. I would not have recommended getting another dragon. It's not guaranteed the new one will get it, but there is a solid chance.  Also, the dragon came from the same store from the same tank. Odds are it has YF regardless."
BeardedDragons,3dv47q,jdolan8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, my vet said YF is highly contagious, and sees it all the time. I had my beardie tested for it."
BeardedDragons,3dv47q,EpitaphREI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:14 2015 UTC,How was your dragon tested?
BeardedDragons,3dv47q,jdolan8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"It was a skin swab type of test, to see if a certain type of protein was present (it said CANV test on my bill). My vet has bearded dragons himself, and swears by it. That is all I know about it!  It was like 70 dollars though. Idk what your financial situation is like"
BeardedDragons,3dv47q,EpitaphREI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP - I don't need any dragons tested. However, I would question the efficacy of that test. YF is not always present on the skin, thus the cells would not show any reaction to it. It can be internal, effecting the skeletal system, and still not show externally despite shedding spores in the feces. That's part of why it is so hard to treat.   This is my opinion without doing research on this particular test, however. I'm interested, but I have doubts. I'll check it out, though."
BeardedDragons,3dthu0,fireside-,2,Sun Jul 19 08:23:40 2015 UTC,"There's one really important question with parted mouths in this pose - does it look like that when he's standing up, moving around, basking, etc?  Oftentimes when they rest on their beards, their lips part a little bit, so if it's only when he's resting on his chin, then it's not likely to be MBD.  If it's always parted, then it very likely is."
BeardedDragons,3dthu0,merlyn923,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"For something like this I would ask the vet during a regular visit, we can't really diagnose with a single photo and without meeting the individual unless something is really obviously quite wrong"
BeardedDragons,3dthu0,Saint_The_George,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell for sure, but that is a symptom of Metabolic Bone Disease.

BeardedDragons,3dthu0,dm1381a,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure about his mouth (I've seen healthy beardies do that on occasion -- not all the time though) but he doesnt look happy; I would review the sidebar info/a good care sheet and make sure he's getting proper temps (dont guess use an infrared checker or a thermostat), light, calcium, uvb, diet, etc...  Again as others said it's one photo. If he seems lethargic and is hiding a lot and you're not sure what to do it might be time to see a vet."
BeardedDragons,3dthu0,Birdie83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'll second /u/merlyn923 on this - it's possible, but not absolutely not a guaranteed sign of MBD.  My guy Warra does tiny bleps like this all the time when he's relaxed, but his mouth closes fully when he wants it to.  As long as you're not seeing limb tremors, other warping of his limbs/toes/tail, and he can close his mouth fully, I'm pretty sure he's fine and doesn't have MBD."

BeardedDragons,3drx4g,auryncharm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:24:20 2015 UTC,I've used a regular coil florescent on the cool side of the viv that is not a UVB emitting bulb.  In fact I have one for mine now and haven't had any eye issues from it.  I would stay clear of the UVB compacts but I don't think that the regular plain fluorescents would do any harm.
BeardedDragons,3drx4g,merlyn923,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"That's not true for non-UVB.  It's the hotspots from UVB that cause the eye damage, not the visible light spectrum :)"

BeardedDragons,3dnnz3,chasingcars825,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've looked into tile before and actually went to newspaper awhile back, because my beardie had just that- impaction!

Thanks for the heads up though! I used to use ExoTerra dirt, and it was horrible! :)"
BeardedDragons,3dnnz3,HastaLaMuerte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:43 2015 UTC,Please switch to tile or paper towel. 99.9% of loose substrate is asking for your Beardie to die.

BeardedDragons,3dnzih,drucius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't breed dubia, they are more meat per insect for your beardie and much better value ordering them online because they survive shipment.  I use DubaiRoaches.com.  200 for less than $30, thats more than a month supply.  They eat the same food as crickets and you can keep them in the same bins."

BeardedDragons,3dnzih,harlequinlette,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"It varies of course but assuming 3/4-1in ""medium/large"" dubia vs ""large"" crickets from the pet shop.  I would say 1 dubia = 3 crickets; so 3 good sized roaches would be more of a meal than 10 crickets.      As I mentioned earlier, i have found that dubia more than make up for the higher initial cost by not dying off like crickets.  I foolishly bought 200 right before my beardie decided to bromate for 4 months in December.  Crickets would have been a total loss; with the roaches i just changed the water pillows every 3 days, add cricket food when needed, and change the egg crate monthly.  I maybe had 6 dead roaches from thanksgiving until labor day when Steve decided to come out of his winter mope and eat again.  Bonus is that dubia cant fly as nyphs or jump.  If you place them in a pyrex bowl they stay contained and you wont have to clean dead crickets out of the vivarium.  Double bonus, NO CHIRPING."

BeardedDragons,3dn0hd,merlyn923,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"You're doing a fantastic job.  I highly suggest looking into dubia roaches as a feeder - they're far healthier than supers, and once you get a colony established, the monthly costs are minimal.  If you have any questions on how to do that, please let me know.  As for the hammock, I have a couple of suggestions:  1) Buy a couple of screw-in hooks to hang it on.  2) Use some 3M Command Hooks to hang it on.  Either of those will work just fine- just remove the suction cups and use the holes they went through on the hooks!"

BeardedDragons,3dkwcw,merlyn923,2,Fri Jul 17 19:19:10 2015 UTC,I have ordered from them three times. First was a starter colony ( Yeah right) and the other two were auctions I won on fb. Took them forever to ship and when I Finally got my roaches there wasn't anywhere near as many as I ordered! Dubideli have been amazing and my favorite!!
BeardedDragons,3dkwcw,harlequinlette,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:37:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, and I'm sorry to hear you had such a crappy experience with them. I too have thought about ordering from them, but to be honest, their shoddy web design (I can't help it, I'm a designer) is what initially threw me off. I will definitely be sure to steer clear in the future.  As for calling themselves west coast, maybe they weren't taught the Never Eat Soggy Waffles rule like we were as kids. :P"
BeardedDragons,3dkwcw,thelefthelix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:08:09 2015 UTC,"This has been very similar to my experiences with them as well. I have ordered, I dont even know how many times now. Its easily 10+ times and I order by the 1000 at a time minimum sometimes 2000 roaches. (waiting for my colony to take off). There has been times were I have ordered on friday and not gotten them until the next saturday and there are times were I get my order within 3-4 days. Which is ironic considering I feel like I'm overpaying for 2-3 day shipping not 3-4.... I have 2 very hungry dragons to feed..  There has been several times where I have paid for cold packs and when my roachesfinally arrive there is no cold pack in there. Luckily though, I have NEVER had even 1 dead roach in ANY of my shipments. I live in Virginia so its not very far away from me, which is one of the reasons I continue to order from this place. I have tried a few other sites and received dead roaches on arrival.  I have also had problems with customer service being so delayed in response. So I feel your pain there. When you are paying good money for this kind of stuff you expect a decent interaction with them.  TLDR: If you are going to order from west coast roach just be sure give yourself PLENTY of lead time in order to have overlap or you will probably have hungry beardies :/"
BeardedDragons,3dkwcw,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:13:16 2015 UTC,"I too live in VA and have had the same hit or miss issues that OP has described.  They supposedly guarantee the shipments, and I've had several large adults arrive DOA, despite using a cold pack at their recommendation, late in the spring when it was not EXTREMELY hot by any standards at all.  So, when you have DOAs with them, they want you to take a picture and send it to them.  And, when they get the picture, they claim ""Oh, that's not dead, that's a shedded shell!""  Despite it definitely not being a shell.  I'm glad someone else has put a review of them on here, the thought of sharing my own bad experiences has never crossed my mind..."
BeardedDragons,3dkwcw,SirSilentBob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"Oh well this is good to know, I haven't had any DOAs yet. That really sucks that the customer service is like this. The reason I chose to continue to use this place is its so much closer to me than any other site. I'm definitely looking forward to the days I no longer have to depend on them.  My local breeders are $20 for 100 small dubia... so its way better for me to order them. I just have to work around their schedules and service in order to make sure I always have my feeders.

They are used in cricket breeding to keep the enclosures clean, they eat refuse and detritus.  They are perfectly safe for your beardie and are clean as they come from the same controlled environment as the crickets.  I have no idea what the nutritional value is though.  I had the same thing, about 30 of these in with 150 crickets.  I made no special effort to prevent feeding them to The George and most of them died before I ran out of crickets.  He ate probably 2 or three of them.  edit: it is not a caterpillar."

They ended up living above & below each other, & when both were near the front of their cages, Baby could look up & see Duke & immediately he'd switch into Gremlin mode & tear up & down the glass kicking up sand like he was making some kind of point.

Idk why they still make them, because they just simply do more damage than harm. Coiled bulbs have a tendency to hurt reptilian eyes, even to the extreme of blinding them.  Hopefully this link works, but if not, search Amazon for 'Reptisun 10.0 UVB bulb' and it should be the first result. It also shows a GE 18 inch light fixture in the 'Commonly Bought Together' section, at about the same price from any hardware store.

BeardedDragons,3dgczn,_Tebro,2,Thu Jul 16 01:40:53 2015 UTC,"The head shaking has me concerned.  This could be from a few different causes.  It could be a calcium deficiency, or a neurological problem, or atadenovirus.  If the shaking continues and she's continued not eating, I'd bring her to the vet.  Is she still a baby/juvie?  You could try dribbling some veggie baby food mixed with her calcium and vitamins on her snout with an oral syringe.  They generally lap this up pretty well.  If the lack of appetite continues, it could be a parasite related issue, which still requires veterinary medication.  Also, is she drinking for you or are you bathing her?  If she's dehydrated, that will also cause them to have a lack of appetite."
BeardedDragons,3dgczn,auryncharm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:55 2015 UTC,"She is still a baby and the only calcium she has had was from the few crickets that she ate Friday and today.

Is there a certain type or brand of baby food that would be best for her to eat?

You just have to look at them (regardless of where you get one) to make sure they are healthy. Make sure there aren't any missing toes, check to make sure their eyes and mouth are clear, and make sure they are active. Also, check the enclosure to see that there is a uvb light, heat lamp, and that they are being given a proper diet.   Better yet, check Craigslist in your area to see if you could rescue one.

BeardedDragons,3de442,thelefthelix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"As long as it's secure, the screen isn't blocking any of the light, and your dragon can't come into contact with it, then I don't think it would be a problem."

BeardedDragons,3dcshu,Spencer_the_dog,3,Wed Jul 15 06:53:35 2015 UTC,"Once beardies are out of the hatchling stages (which would be when a responsible breeder would sell you one), they are pretty hardy little lizards. The main thing to watch out for, assuming all your heating and lighting is correct, is prey size. If you are in doubt on the size, always go smaller to be safe. When they are young, impaction poses the greatest threat in my opinion, and this is simply avoided by solid substrates and proper prey.  For heat bulbs, the best thing to remember is that it doesn't need to be anything special, so long as it provides heat. You can get an indoor/outdoor flood light that will do the job just fine. As for wattage, your mileage may vary depending on your individual setup. If you purchase a bulb and your temps are not hot enough, you can increase the wattage. If they are too hot, you can lower the wattage. The UVB bulb is the one where brand really matters, and for this you will want a Reptisun 10.0 tube. Don't use coil type lights for either.  I do not support the use of any kind of loose substrate, because dragons (especially babies) tend to run around and lick things. Of course, this means that if you use a loose substrate, some will get ingested regardless of where they are fed or how much is used. Instead, I opt for tile, as I imagine most of the users here do as well. A textured tile will not only keep them safe, but it will also provide them with traction, and even file their nails so you will not have to clip them. It also does not need to be replaced, and cleaning is simply a matter of wiping it down for spot cleaning, or the occasional scrubbing. Hammocks are a matter of preference for the individual dragon, but most I've seen tend to enjoy them. I personally prefer a branch or something solid that will warm up to help aid with their digestion. Not only is a large branch great for this purpose, but it also provides a variety of different 'levels', so he has plenty of options for whatever temperature he feels he needs at the time.    Kudos to you for asking questions ahead of time, and doing your homework before you bring your dragon home. If you have any others don't be afraid to ask, most of the folks around here are quite happy to help! Best of luck."

BeardedDragons,3dcshu,thelefthelix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome. If you mean the fixture itself, then no you don't need anything special, so long as it is a florescent tube light fixture with an appropriate wattage and size to match whichever reptisun 10.0 bulb you go with for your setup.   These fixtures can be found relatively easy at your local hardware store, or even Walmart carries some under the counter florescent fixtures for around the $10 price range depending on the size you're after."
BeardedDragons,3dcshu,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:17:55 2015 UTC,"The links on the right hand side of the page will help you tremendously. Specifically the Comprehensive Care Guide and the Nutrition Content should be your go to links for all of your questions. Also as a side note: make sure your tank is a 50 long tank (breeder). You want a tank that's got area for them to crawl and roam. Trying to heat up a tank thats tall is very difficult, and the UVB becomes much less effective if you mount it at the top of the terrarium."
BeardedDragons,3dcshu,hammerpatrol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:27:18 2015 UTC,"This link says not to use soil as a substrate, but you're going to get varying views and opinions from everywhere.   There are also some other substrates that harbor so much bacteria and such that they are not good ones either.  These include soils, mulches, corn cob, millet, and rabbit pellets.    I've never seen or heard of using soil or moss for a bearded dragon, but then again I'm fairly new to this myself.  I would recommend slate tile myself and staying away from sand.   For light, just make sure you've got a heat bulb that gets up to about 100-110F, type or brand doesn't really matter here. And a tube UVB light is recommended by a lot of people here. Reptisun 10.0 is what I hear about more than anything.  As Lobos said the Comprehensive Care Guide will have just about everything you'll need. You sound like you really care about your future pet and I'm sure you'll do fine. Good luck."

BeardedDragons,3dc0sq,v13,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Sorry I'm late but here's some BoP info:  Birds of prey are often ""wed"" to a certain type of prey, meaning an individual bird may have had a lot of success with, say, snakes.  That bird will be more likely to hunt for snakes since it has caught them in the past.  While most raptors are usually looking for a smart meal and the majority of raptor species are specially adapted to hunting furred and feathered quarry, there are a couple of species that are generalists.  This means they are top tier predators that are capable of taking down a wide variety of prey.  Since I live in the USA, I can really only speak for BoPs native to my country-- the Red-tailed hawk and the Great-horned owl are the two you should look out for.  Although they are powerful hunters, they tend to give potential predators--like humans--a wide berth.  They shy away from any critter that might put up too much of a fight as well.  ""A hawk carried my dog/cat away"" stories are a dime a dozen but rarely true.  Raptors are as curious as they are nervous and like to see what's going on around them.  They can also exhibit aggression near the nest.  Most raptors that ""tried to kill your dog"" were trying to drive them away from the bird's territory, not kill and eat them.  Anyway, got off on a tangent there...  Stay within eyeshot of your pets.  The local birds of prey can see you and they don't want anything to do with you.  It is only the rare, desperate, and insanely courageous hawk or owl that will take a pass at your pets if you are in the immediate vicinity.  That being said, I have seen hawks that became very adept at killing lizards (the largest in my area being collared lizards, 8""-10"" long).  Redtails are known to prey on large snakes (bull or gopher snakes) in my area as well.  Keep an eye on your pets and know that it is rare for a bird of prey to attack if you are in the immediate area."

BeardedDragons,3da9t0,auryncharm,2,Tue Jul 14 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Carnivore care is kind of rich and very high in protein for an animal that is not eating well to begin with.  How are her drinking habits?  If she is on the dehydrated side, she will have difficulty eating and digesting food.  I would first make sure that she's hydrated (mixture of flavored Pedialyte and water, any flavor of Pedialyte really, my beardie's favorite is strawberry).  I'd mix the Pedialyte 1/4 to 3/4 water.  Try squirting a very small amount into her mouth via an oral syringe to give her a taste.  Then you should be able to drip it in her lips for her to lick it off.  They say usually 2 to 4 mls per kg of body weight but not all at once.  Split it between several drinks throughout the day.  Once she's sufficiently hydrated, try a gentle slurry, maybe some banana baby food mixed with a bit of water to thin and a little Ensure drink (recommended by anapsid's website- http://www.anapsid.org/emaciation.html).  This is a very gentle food, easy to digest and contains lots of nutrients for her.  My beardie is currently getting slurries from these recipes right now himself.  He has a GI infection of some kind right now and on antibiotics and not eating well on his own.  He seems to be doing better on these than the critical and carnivore care that he was on before."

Also, if your beardie is only a year and a half old, you should be dusting the live feeders more than twice a week. Once they are over 18 months old they need calcium supplemented 3 times a week and a multivitamin once a week.   Lack of appetite could be caused by a number of things though. A little over a year ago I went through something similar with my guy due to a bad case of coccidia. My vet gave him medicine and Carnivore Care too to help his appetite.   If your dragon does have coccidia, I'd recommend this cleaner. It actually kills coccidia while other cleaners like bleach and chlorhexidine don't. When 1 ounce is mixed per gallon of water it's considered to be a hospital strength disinfectant.

Find out what bulb connection is needed and you can get a 60watt Spot Light or Regular (Clear is better than Frosted) from the nearest supermarket (I get mine from Asda). Do not get Halogen bulbs. This is his basking bulb, it should be in one area of the tank and the Beardie should be placed underneath it so he can soak up all the heat.  You should also get a UVB light(which is the long strip bulb) if his is gone but that will cost a fair bit. You can get them on amazon but you need to find out what size you need. It might be easier to check the bulb in there already if he still has it.   Once he's warm, see if he will eat. Does the Brother have any food for him? What the Brother has been feeding him and how often?  Is there any chance you can measure/weigh him at all? Do you know how old he is? Does he look a little thin? Are his toes/legs at odd angles at all?  Where abouts in England are you (assuming from the £), find out where your nearest reptile shop is and ask them to help out."

But as far as I can tell he's never had a strip bulb, I'll bring all of this up with the brother and hopefully get him to do something."
BeardedDragons,3d8nxx,Shubeans,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"Eeeesh. Okay, for him to be 6 years old, but have never had a UVB bulb is really bad.   If you can take a picture of the tank so we can see the fixtures that would be extremely handy! As /hammerpatrol has said a coil is the best short term fix for him right now until you can get a UVB bulb.  The reason he's not eating is likely because he's cold, but there may be other issues there as well.   You can get it done on the amount you have. Get the bulbs- heat him up. Stick him under a lamp wrapped in a towel/blanket for an hour if you have to. Crickets will cost £3 for a tub, grab some reptile Calcium as well, it comes in a little pot. Just sprinkle that over all of the crickets. OR make up a nice veggie dish for him: Watercress, Strawberries, Parsnip. Almost anything except lettuce and citrus fruits, then sprinkle that with Calcium dust.   Where are his parents? because I for one would be screaming at them right now for not forcing him to look after his pets better, and then yelling at him for being a complete wanker. In fact, make HIM pay for the shit, or his parents.   It might be worth getting the beardie to a vet as well, but that will cost more than £40! (Pets at home are great)"

And I'd take a chance of eye problems over a chance of MBD any day though. But, that's just my opinion. Everyone should do their own research and come to their own conclusions.   But I guess I should have stressed that the coil UVB should definitely be a temp fix.  He should be working towards a tube UVB as a final solution. It's just that he's tight on money and a Coil  is a lot cheaper than a Tube and Fixture.  Again, just my opinion."

BeardedDragons,3d75sw,Saint_The_George,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"People are silly, coil ones work fine, they used to have an issue with streaking (brighter and darker areas) which had the potential to irritate beardie eyes and possibly cause permanent damage over the long run.  That is no longer the case with the big names (like reptisun).  Adding a tube as well is still a good idea since UVB throughout the enclosure is desirable as well as a place to bask in with bright UVB and high heat.  I have the same coil bulb and a 18"" t8 reptisun 10.0 bulb as well."
BeardedDragons,3d75sw,merlyn923,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's not true really.  Yes, the streaking issue has mostly been fixed, but the actual UVB output of these bulbs degrades very quickly still.  You would need to replace them essentially every 2ish months for them to output enough UVB.  And despite the fact that the hotspots are supposedly fixed, there are still dragons coming down with UVB induced photokeratoconjunctivitis.  There just isn't really any good reason to use a coil."
BeardedDragons,3d75sw,Saint_The_George,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I know they have to be replaced a lot, the reason I use a coil is to create a high uvb environment in the basking area as well as some uvb throughout.

Slate Tile - Easy to clean, looks cooler, helps keep claws under control when they get bigger.  Tube UVB - I don't have much experience but I can say that the day I went from Coil to Tube is the day that Tigrex finally ate for the first time under my care.  PS: Cool of you to have everything set up before hand. You sound like you know your stuff."
BeardedDragons,3d75sw,hammerpatrol,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Anyway, I was planning on getting tile, but the aquarium has some integrated tubing on the back middle and back sides, and it seemed too hard to measure/cut/blah blah blah"

BeardedDragons,3d4ygj,atomhunter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:16:53 2015 UTC,You're right. I added more tile today so that a majority of the tank is stone. I left a tiny section of sand though because that's where he likes to poop lol

BeardedDragons,3d7ep4,HandsomeWilliam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:36:13 2015 UTC,I'm still a new bearded dragon owner after becoming the keeper of a 2 or 3 year old. What I've found out after a lot of research is that bearded dragons love superworms. Like flat out love. They're the chocolate crack of BDs. They will quickly become spoiled and refuse to eat anything else.  What I've been doing is simply fasting my girl for a few days from bugs until she get's back to eating greens and squash again. Then I'll start up the worms. I'm having to repeat this process every couple of weeks as she gets respoiled on the worms.
BeardedDragons,3d7ep4,Bunnyhat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:42:59 2015 UTC,I keep my supers in a large cricket tank( no crickets) with sawdust cover and the second I pull out the container he will drop what he is doing and pace the glass trying his best to get those worms.
BeardedDragons,3d7ep4,auryncharm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, supers are kind of an iffy primary feeder.  Some will say that they are fine, but they've always given my beardie digestive issues because of their harder shell.  Beardies do love their supers though.  Maybe try giving him some butter worms or silk worms or some horn worms.  These are nice and soft and most beardies like these.    As for the urates being hard, how often do you bathe your beardie and does he ever drink.  Hard urates are usually a sign of dehydration.  I would try to give him some water to drink.  I find that my beardie drinks willingly when he first gets up in the morning, before giving him food.  You could give fluids by oral syringe or by squirt bottle spraying on the tip of this mouth."
BeardedDragons,3d7ep4,auryncharm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:54:48 2015 UTC,"I bath him once a week, spray him down regularly during the week, and spray his veggies down with water right as I serve them. I may try a water dropper or something but I have sprayed water right on his lips and he sometimes opens to allow water but mostly keeps his mouth shut."
BeardedDragons,3d7ep4,Saint_The_George,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:24:30 2015 UTC,He's not getting enough water then.  I'd always had trouble getting my beardie to drink.  I started giving him a mixture of flavored Pedialyte and water through an oral syringe.  He found out that he likes the taste and I've switched him over to a small animal water bottle to drink from now.  The strawberry flavor is his favorite.
BeardedDragons,3d56lh,Akraff96,5,Mon Jul 13 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"looks like it got bit/injured, if it's as bad as it looks to me, that tip will fall off. if you take care of it, and keep the wound clean, he won't even notice it"
BeardedDragons,3d56lh,majorkurn,3,Mon Jul 13 16:48:10 2015 UTC,Yeah when It was like this when I got him but as he is growing it looks more and more like it will just fall off. Any tips on how to keep it clean? I would hate for it to spread or cause him pain
BeardedDragons,3d56lh,FishyJoeJr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"You could always ask your vet for some cleaner. Mine gave me a liquid to apply with cotton swabs for my beadies lip. I've also had ointment, but I can't remember the exact name of it but something along the lines of silver something or another. They both worked really well, but obviously you'll want to ask a vet for the real names."
BeardedDragons,3d56lh,dm1381a,3,Mon Jul 13 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"The tip of the tail is broken, probably from the bite. There is also necrotic tissue. You should bring your beardie to the vet, as necrotic tissue can spread and will make your beardie lose much more than the tip of its tail."

BeardedDragons,3d6pyq,mykidthinksiamwierd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:10 2015 UTC,Boil and scrub the rock. Get in the crevasses too. You're supposed to remove the log's bark and soak it in water/bleach. I've just put sticks in the freezer for 24 hours. I read that kills the germs.
BeardedDragons,3d6pyq,_Tebro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:31 2015 UTC,"You read wrong, many bacteria just become inactive in freezing temperatures and come back when it's warm.  The best way to kill them is reach thermal death point, 100C is too high for almost all bacteria"
BeardedDragons,3d6pyq,Saint_The_George,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"Best disinfectant procedure is to raise the temperature (median internal temp, not surface temp) to 100C for 10 seconds.  That will kill most known bacteria.  It may take a significant amount of time in boiling water to achieve that internal temp though"
BeardedDragons,3d6eyx,gingerbreadman2687,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"if you've got the temperature and the right bulbs (reptisun 10.0, and a decent basking bulb that's not coloured) right then he's probably just napping, if you want to set a specific time for feeding, just wake him gently, talk to him, reach from the side, gently pull back the paper towel, etc. and let him eat for 10-15 min"
BeardedDragons,3d6eyx,majorkurn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:47 2015 UTC,Thanks will do.
BeardedDragons,3d6eyx,hammerpatrol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, but I don't feed mine in the tank. As you shouldn't leave crickets in there when it's not feeding time (they can bite and nip), I think it's best to feed them in a separate container.  I use a tupperware container just big enough for him to chase the crickets down, but not lose them.  Just my 2cents.  But on to your question, it's probably just relocation stress if you just got it yesterday (or the day before). I hear it's recommended to take out their hides for the first week or two until they get acclimated to the new surroundings, otherwise they'll just hide forever.  Mine wasn't really comfortable until about week 2 or 3 and didn't really start eating until a couple days after I got him.   Just be persistent with feedings and make sure he has ways to stay warm. I've had mine for about 2 or 3 months and he still worries me from time to time. We're going through our first shed now he's being a real grump."
BeardedDragons,3d6eyx,hammerpatrol,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:52 2015 UTC,Thanks I put just a few crickets out last night and he came right out after a gentle wake up and started feeding. He hasn't gone back into hiding yet!
BeardedDragons,3d5i9j,B0UNDL3SS,2,Mon Jul 13 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"I would bring him to see the vet.  There are a lot of causes for twitching aside from atadenovirus.  It could be something as simple as a calcium deficiency.  I know it is a symptom of adeno, but don't always jump to conclusions and think the worst (hard to do, I know).  Have the vet check for other causes first to rule them out.  I've seen it where it is something as simple as calcium, and I hope that this is the case for you."
BeardedDragons,3d5i9j,auryncharm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, I give them both tons of calcium every day in their slurries as well as on their bugs and they both spend a lot of time getting plenty of UVB so I feel like it's not that :/ but it won't hurt to ask.."
BeardedDragons,3d5i9j,auryncharm,2,Tue Jul 14 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but depending upon the type of calcium used, different types are metabolized differently.  Maybe he can't properly metabolize the type you are using?  I've seen strange things like this happen."
BeardedDragons,3d6dji,boldaslovex,9,Mon Jul 13 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"Smaug is being dominant by being on top of norbert, but on their own, that's a common sleeping position.   You really shouldn't house 2 beardies in the same tank (except when you're trying to breed them) as one will dominate the other (making it ill from lack of resources or from injuries), or will mate with the other till it's dead.  plus sand in general is bad, due to bacteria, cleanliness levels, impaction risks and it's not like their home terrain."
BeardedDragons,3d6dji,majorkurn,-7,Mon Jul 13 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"Hi there, thanks for the reply. Honestly I've had worries in the past about their dominance but we got them as a pair and I know the signs of dominance (lying on top of one another, hogging food, stealing majority of light source etc.) and the dominant one of the pair appears to change very regularly which is why I feel maybe their dynamic just seems to work. They have lived together for around 3 years now and we've never had any problems apart from a couple of unwanted eggs. They seem happy together and share their food very fairly."

BeardedDragons,3d2h7u,squishybloo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:17:36 2015 UTC,I'm sure they did. Health care protocol is to wash hands prior to touching a patient as well as after you've administered treatment.
BeardedDragons,3d1596,NeakosOK,2,Sun Jul 12 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"I've found that clear incandescent bulbs make great basking bulbs. Personally I've found the Aero-Tech brand bulbs to be a great value and last a long time. Clear bulbs seem to radiate a lot more heat than frosted (soft) bulbs.   If you're just looking for extra light without more heat, LEDs would work very well. You'll want a decent LED driver for the light strips to avoid any flickering. Some of the cheap ones basically use a simple diode to convert AC to DC which means there will be a slight flicker at 60Hz. I'm unsure of whether beardies would be able to perceive this flicker, but it's better safe than sorry.  CFL's could also be used for regular lighting, though consumer CFL's will emit minimal UV light at best. Once again, buy nice ones to avoid any flickering and noise from the built in ballast.  Remember none of the above lights described are a replacement for your UV light! If your dragon spends most of its time hiding away from the light, you may want to take some away. Otherwise extra light isn't going to hurt anything."

BeardedDragons,3cz5sc,bongllama,2,Sun Jul 12 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing I would consider a necessary addition would be another UVB tube for the lower level.

BeardedDragons,3cz5sc,surrogateuterus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:43:10 2015 UTC,I read that incandescent bulbs give off both UVA and UVB that is what I have down below. Am I mistaken on that?
BeardedDragons,3cz5sc,Jerrshington,3,Sun Jul 12 04:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Incandescent bulbs do not have uvb. They make compact fluorescent bulbs that have uvb, however they are generally inconsistent with output and often cause eye issues. You'll wanna make sure you put a long tube fluorescent uvb in there."
BeardedDragons,3cz5sc,SquirrelTactic,2,Sun Jul 12 12:36:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are mistaken. You need a separate UVB bulb for him. Ideally this will be a reptisun 10.0 tube bulb that fits in a long tube light fixture, mounted inside his cage. Don't get one of the small coil bulbs, they're bad for his eyes amd will only give him UVB in one or two specific spots."

BeardedDragons,3cz5sc,chasingcars825,2,Sun Jul 12 07:09:44 2015 UTC,"It was a concern to me too. That's one reason why the net is so wide. So he can't fall off missing a ramp or something. I even considered making another net half way down for him to fall into. But he does better than I thought he would. And he doesn't jump off the top.  He just sits on the very top and basks while looking over watching everything going on. He looks over the edge but hasn't jumped. He runs back down the cargo net then turns around and jumps between the holes in the net to the bottom. But he lands on the soft ""grass"" and doesn't skip a beat. I don't know why he won't go back down the ramp. He will have to when he is bigger."

BeardedDragons,3cyoa6,grease_cat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:30 2015 UTC,Well the white part is the equivalent to urine so as long as it's there he should be fine. A good way to check for dehydration is to pinch part of their loose skin. If it stays standing and does not return to its original shape that means they are dehydrated.
BeardedDragons,3cyoa6,parkmeeae,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've done this trick before, and it always snaps back done. It's actually something I learned from my mom working with elderly patients to check if they are dehydrated."
BeardedDragons,3cyoa6,auryncharm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"The baths are good for the skin to keep moisturized and they do absorb some fluids through their vents, but oral fluids are really the best way to hydrate a beardie (or any other animal really).  If the urates are just firm, not hard, then he should be okay.  If his eyes look a little baggy, or if his skin stays tented when you gently pinch his side, then he needs more fluids.  You know what has worked well for my baby?  He's been ill, unfortunately, and on antibiotics and they need extra fluids while on meds.  So I was initially dripping water into is mouth by oral syringe, which he didn't really care for too much.  Instead, I decided to try a small animal water bottle, you know one with the little ball in the top like they use for hamsters.  He took to this very well. He drinks more in the morning, a little bit after he wakes up, even before he gets food.  He will drink his fill from it."

The two biggest problems are that you have a loose substrate - holds bacteria like a sponge and beardies lick everything which can lead to life threatening impaction.  And you have a red light, which is not good for reptile eyes and will disrupt their sleep.   There is a lot of information out there, we all here want to try to help you wade through the ocean of misinformation and help you have the healthiest happiest beardie possible!"
BeardedDragons,3cvmht,chasingcars825,2,Sat Jul 11 04:21:19 2015 UTC,Awesome advice! Also please be sure to look in to a UVB light and calcium supplement.

BeardedDragons,3cvmht,dickCheeseAndMustard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:56:21 2015 UTC,"thank you very much for the reply, I have been reading as much as I can and I will be taking the substrate out today and switching it with something like critter carpet maybe?"
BeardedDragons,3cvmht,chasingcars825,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:06:20 2015 UTC,Tile is the best liked around here. Homedepot will cut them to size for you when you buy the tiles at the store.  Papertowels or newspaper second. The critter carpet snags nails and is difficult to clean.

I just noticed today when he was eating that he's got this white, kind of flaky stuff in his mouth. A few minutes later I checked it after he was done eating and it seems like there's a cut or something there? It hasn't affected his eating or anything and he doesn't seem to be bothered by me touching his mouth. Still behaving normally aside from a little extra time in his hide every day (though that could just be because he's shedding and uncomfortable). Any ideas?"
BeardedDragons,3cu0ri,squishybloo,2,Fri Jul 10 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"I would keep an eye on it every day or so in case it starts looking inflamed or infected.

BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,tjs1993,3,Fri Jul 10 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm new to bearded dragon care, but heating pads are a no go and you need a reptisun 10 tube bulb IN ADDITION to a basking light. You can't have just one or the other.    Edit: As far as I know , I am by no means an expert. It looks good other than that!"
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,atomiclolz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"This bulb is all in one heating and UVB so only need 1 light. And from the things I have read online I know the heated rocks are a no go and bad but all recommended and said the heat pads are fine, interested on any other opinions on them being bad or not. Thanks for your input though :D"
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,_P1nk13_P13_,3,Fri Jul 10 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"Heat pads are a no no for the same reason the rocks are: they can get random heat spikes and since your beardie can't feel heat through his belly, he could very easily get burned. So there's that risk plus the fact that they aren't benefitting from it anyhow."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,thelefthelix,2,Fri Jul 10 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"I'm actually wondering if I should move the heating pad to the outside of the tank, it has an adhesive stick to it and I originally just had it stuck on the back of the tank right behind tree cave. I can understand it being bad under the tank with the bearded sitting on top of it/it being too hot."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,nizzlethizzle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:41:46 2015 UTC,"With it attached to the outside of the tank, I'm not sure if it will contribute much to the ambient temperature in the tank. If not, you could always use it for a dubia colony. :P"
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,squishybloo,0,Fri Jul 10 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"I do that, works pretty good. I use it so the he can have somewhere warm to sleep. If he was inclined to do so."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,chensley,2,Sat Jul 11 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"You really, really should not use a heating pad for a beardie.  They need heat from above, not belly heat, to digest and warm up.   Additionally, now that you've stuck the heat mat on, if you rip it off you will bend the elements inside and make it either break and not work or break and (worse) overheat.  Possibly become a fire hazard.  Heat mats are not appropriate for beardies.  It's not a matter of opinion."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,digital_mana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about a heat + uvb light but you need to really check that your beardie is getting enough uvb. I'd recommend getting the reptisun anyway,  even if you don't think you need it."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,Robynblue,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:48 2015 UTC,The MV bulb he has probably puts out more UVB than a reptisun...

All in one is totally the best option for me since it gets rid of all the clutter about the cage that in my opinion is a fire hazard :) love the set up! I've personally never used a heating pad for my Indie, since the vet rendered that it would be virtually useless since they have no heat receptors on their belly anyway haha! Burns are a concern more with one-setting heat pads, I don't have an issue with people using good quality ones that have a very low setting, they just don't really contribute much to the dragon haha!  -zoology/zookeeping technology student"

BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,ChurchofSkatan666,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:50:18 2015 UTC,Maybe a bit more vertically oriented stuff?
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,WheresMyDietDrKelp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:08:16 2015 UTC,"This. You've got great basking space throughout, but you can probably make space in the center/right side for something more climbable (depends on the beardie of course, mine have always loved to jump and climb while others just prefer the basking)."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,jung0k,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:08:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things about the combo bulbs, see how it works for your dragon. Do away with the heating pad. The dial thermometers are inaccurate, so get a probe or a thermal gun. The water bowl and a pool are a little much. You don't need either, unless your having problems humidity. Weekly baths are better for hydration. With those features gone there's more room for hides and basking spots. Make sure you have a basking side and a cool side. You got a lot of tank to work with. Trust me you'll be moving it around a lot to fit your beardies needs."
BeardedDragons,3cu9ob,digital_mana,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:55:10 2015 UTC,I'd be careful the little guy doesn't try and eat that moss. Otherwise looks fine. Keep a close eye on humidity with a big dish of water like that in there.

If you can't afford to buy new lights TODAY, you need to get him into the hands of someone with the means to take care of him. Coil bulbs are bad, and even if you had the proper bulb, they last a little bit less than a year if you have a quality bulb. If you can't afford these things, you can't keep him. They aren't optional.   But he needs to see a vet TODAY not tomorrow."

When I told them I think he's got problems with his kidneys, among other things, (your post confirms, or at least validates my concerns) they both just said ""There's probably nothing wrong with him"" which is so frustrating to me. I know this is /r/beardeddragons and not /r/imlookingforcounselling but I'm sick of my worries being invalidated constantly.  My car is being fixed right now, and the nearest vet is like...a two hour walk. It's 32 degrees outside.   I'm honestly mad at my parents for buying him and not knowing ANYTHING about beardies, and burdening me with him. I mean, looking after him, quote unquote, has been fun, and it's opened the door to my love for reptiles, but I'd rather him be healthy from day 1 he hatched until now, then me realize I love reptiles.

BeardedDragons,3ckq2g,mere_iguana,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:12 2015 UTC,You should look into breeding. I'm sure lots of people would love to have one like that! You could even make your own morph. Firebeard. Or something like that.

BeardedDragons,3cnq46,accreditednobody,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"Too much filler. It's like multi vitamins for us. Good if you aren't getting it else where, but better to get it from fresh sources.  Live insects, fresh veggies, will be best. Pellets can be supplimented but For the most part pellets are an attempt to 'normalize' reptile domestication. Look at the ingredient list, and you will find items you wouldn't feed your animal. Insects and rodents are 'whole' foods, which are far healthier, pellet uses freeze dried or roasted ingredients, miss out on ALL the water the animals get from their food.  Realistically, maybe one day it will be feesable, but no product available is better for the animal than it is convenient for the human"
BeardedDragons,3cktfn,mintay,2,Wed Jul 8 18:11:41 2015 UTC,Oh my! She had a really beautiful pattern. Is she a specific morph?
BeardedDragons,3cktfn,axolotlaxolotl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"We got her at a PetSmart. They don't really tell you anything about morphs (from my experience). They had a hard enough time trying to tell the difference between the ""fancy"" and ""regular"" bearded dragons (btw, those ""fancy"" and ""regular"" descriptions are just made up by PetSmart, right?)."
BeardedDragons,3cktfn,Daggartx,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"A fancy is just what they call a dragon that has color or a morph.  They have suppliers who sell them dragons wholesale.  The suppliers tell the stores if the Dragon is ""fancy or regular"", the store has no say in the matter and the store then MUST sell the dragon as what it is labeled as.   But yes, typically pet stores don't know anything about their dragons history, and fancy/regular is a made up term to generalize the dragon. Luckily for us, most morphs and pretty distinctive."
BeardedDragons,3cktfn,mere_iguana,2,Thu Jul 9 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. They have no clue about morphs, they just parrot evrything the distributor said to them when he sold them the beardies.  Beautiful colors on her, though!  Good thing you got her out of that hellhole!"
BeardedDragons,3cktfn,Kat1yn,2,Thu Jul 9 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"We actually  don't get any info from the supplier about the dragon. Not EVERY person in pet care knows, and not even pet care people take on the sale every time, so they for sure may not know. I know from doing loads of extra research. Sometimes my store supplier sends a leatherback accidentally as a normal and we get to pass on the savings.  Don't hate every big chain pet store! It really varies on each and every store! :)"

He's about 16 to 18 months old and it's only been the last month that he has started eating any greens (pretty much only rocket). The only reason this is, is because we started to feed him insects every other day which seems to have done the trick, veg is everyday of course. However the last week his appetite has gone through the roof. Normally he'd eat about 6-8 locusts every other day with a few crickets as well if he was feeling in the mood  Now however he just eats almost everything put in front of him. The last feed saw him scoff 31 crickets before he was full and the time before that it was 16 locusts and 18 crickets. It's just nuts how all of a sudden his eating habits have changed."

BeardedDragons,3cfaf4,rawrr483,2,Tue Jul 7 13:39:57 2015 UTC,"Got the exact same problem with Pip at the moment. Story from the pet store after was that previous owner could only afford mealworms, so that's all he got. So he's a bit stunted, and it's been a struggle to get him to eat greens. Try add in some sweet potato or something colorful to the greens, entice him to eat some of it. Pip just very tenderly picks bits out, though, and sometimes he won't risk eating a sweet morsel of sweet potato (or even a superworm if I've got it crawling under the salad) if it means he might accidentally eat some greens.  As a new owner, it's definitely frustrating. Right now (and hopefully can get a voice as well as you on this issue), I'm making his veggie/insect ratio 75/25% of what he eats, not of what I offer, so he's only getting a couple of crickets every few days, and mostly just to keep his gut in some sort of non-runny-salad balance. Even ours hates a pure-salad diet.  He's eaten more some days than others, but never finished off the couple of tablespoons of leafies in there. So we'll see. He's still pooping regularly, so there's that. Where it's all coming from, I have no idea. He'll happily eat a container of mealworms or crickets in one go, though, so I know he's got the room for it.  Patience, and lots of it."

He was eating salads everyday up until he was about 1 year old. Then he just stopped completely and has refused them since. He absolutely hates greens, to the point where he will spit them out if I try and trick him into eating them, or sneak them in his mouth. What I've been doing is getting something like collard greens (anything that is relatively stiff) and I'll kind of see-saw them into his mouth. Once he opens his mouth, I will keep see sawing it until he takes it and swallows. He does put up a fight and will push it out with his tongue, but once it gets past his tongue, he just naturally swallows it. I wouldn't say this is ""force feeding"" since I'm not jamming it down his throat or anything. I'm just putting it in his mouth until he accepts it lol. I don't get much in, but at least a couple of bites is better than nothing. I've tried every staple green and veggie out there, and I've still found nothing that he will eat. Tried all the tricks known to man, and still, nothing. They can just be really stubborn..."

BeardedDragons,3cdmmn,thefurnaceboy,3,Tue Jul 7 02:23:07 2015 UTC,All of this is in the sidebar.
BeardedDragons,3cdmmn,Kitehammer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"Kitehammer is correct. All of this info is in the sidebar. You should really check out the comprehensive care guide. The sidebar here is a godsend and really has EVERYTHING you will ever need to know (and they're expanding it even). But I'll answer some of your questions anywho.  Substrate - Slate tile is recommended. Sand can cause impaction, especially at a young age. Slate is a lot easier to clean in my opinion and can help keep their claws trimmed.  Swimming - It's not something I would FORCE them to do. They DO need baths every now and again, but I usually just fill his tub up to his shoulders. I've never let mine fully swim, but if you plan to I'd recommend having some sort of rock or something in the tub that he can climb onto that's halfway out of the water so he's not forced to keep himself afloat the entire time. It's kinda really up to them whether they want to swim.  Nutrition - They do eat lots of insects. I use crickets, some here use dubai roaches. You never want to feed them any insects (not including worms) any longer than the length between their eyes. They'll pretty much eat what they want though. When they're younger they do eat fewer veggies and more crickets. Vice Versa when they get older. DO NOT feed them cockroaches or any other insects you find outdoors. To keep away from pesticides and bacteria and such you'll want to buy from pet stores or feeder websites online.  Hanging Out - This REALLY depends on the specific dragon. They all have their own personalities. And yes you can handle them regularly. The more you do, the more attached they'll become. Some actually do cuddle with people for warmth. Mine is still very young so he doesn't sit still for long outside his Viv, he likes to run around and explore. But I've read that as they grow older, they do sort of mellow out. When mine gets really stressed it seems to help relieve some of that when I handle him, so I like to think he enjoys being taken out of the Viv.  One more thing if you get a dragon (probably the most important thing). Buy a tube UVB tube light.  Reptisun 10.0 is recommended by a lot of people here.  And make sure to mount it INSIDE the viv.  WOW. I wrote a lot.   But again. READ THE SIDEBAR. It has everything you will need and more."

BeardedDragons,3cck7b,_Tebro,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert, but I'll chip in my two cents for your consideration. (Long post warning!)   Pet stores are a toss up on the health of the animals they carry. I have seen dragons in pet stores that look healthy and alert, but unfortunately I have also seen some that don't look so good. That being said, the benefit of buying from a breeder is that you can find out whether or not your dragon was raised in a good environment, information about the parents, and other information that may be more specific to your dragon. A good breeder will stand behind their animals, and be there to help you should any problems arise. Again though, just go with your gut on whether to buy from them or not, and absolutely do not be afraid to ask questions. As for bonding, I don't think it matters what age. Chances are, if you're the keeper of the bugs and the one that spends the most time with it, a bond will form between you as it would with a juvenile. I personally believe they recognize their main keeper, my juvie reacts entirely different when I approach his enclosure compared to someone else.  A 2 - 3 feeding session regime is best if you can manage it, but this is not a one size fits all rule you absolutely have to follow. You can cut it to 1 or 2 feedings a day, and this simply results in a slower growth rate as long as your husbandry is fine otherwise. If you prefer the 3 a day regime, you can maybe squeeze in a feeding before work as long as he's had about an hour to warm up after lights come on. Make sure you don't feed him 3 - 4 hours before they go off. For playtime outside of the viv, you can just use your best judgement. I wouldn't keep a youngster out for very long, they can cool down pretty quickly depending on the temperature of your home. Adults are much more flexible, and you can have them out for longer periods, again just don't let them get too chilly.    I've rambled on enough now, but I hope it helps you. Best of luck with your new dragon!"

BeardedDragons,3cbucv,WheresMyDietDrKelp,2,Mon Jul 6 23:18:29 2015 UTC,It is also much more similar in hardness and texture to their natural environment than anything else.  They live on hard packed soil.  Tile helps provide good muscle tone because it offers the proper amount of resistance.

BeardedDragons,3c86c3,Eryemil,5,Mon Jul 6 06:18:13 2015 UTC,"It looks so ugly and depressing though.   I'm considering changing from the fine red sand Argent's been on to larger gravel but even that seems like an aesthetic downgrade.   I'm not sure how overblown the risk of impaction is with sand, as pet communities like this one tend to be a bit neurotic. I've gone halfways and feed him in a plastic container outside of his cage which works really well."
BeardedDragons,3c86c3,WheresMyDietDrKelp,2,Mon Jul 6 07:01:22 2015 UTC,You could go into a home improvement or flooring store and get a bigger variety. I found a cool looking tile that's textured that I think looks pretty neat.
BeardedDragons,3c86c3,WheresMyDietDrKelp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:00:03 2015 UTC,Sand can hold bacteria too and they naturally live on a more hard packed clay then loose sand. Tile is nice too because it retains a nice warmth.
BeardedDragons,3c86c3,RippinReaper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:58:42 2015 UTC,I will most likely change to tile then i hate cleaning everything out of the sand lol
BeardedDragons,3c86c3,Lobos42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:22:13 2015 UTC,It smells better in there now too. She's adjusted well and seems to be enjoying it. The downside is I figured out she doesn't like the cockroaches I fed her last week. Found them burrowed deep in the sand.

What do you mean he looks bored?  Edit: to get a beardie to be more comfortable with you you could always throw in a t shirt you've worn recently. If you put something like that in his tank he will get more comfortable with your smell."

BeardedDragons,3c8n0j,SwigidySwagPooInABag,2,Sun Jul 5 22:48:11 2015 UTC,You should be fine for 5 days without uvb. Especially if you can get him some sun time when you can so he can naturally soak some up. Heat is a little more tricky as he's gonna need a heat source. For the car maybe you can try a disposable heat pad? I don't see why you couldnt have a small heat lamp at the hotel though?
BeardedDragons,3c8n0j,WheresMyDietDrKelp,2,Sun Jul 5 23:15:51 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how I would hang a light in a hotel room. I was thinking about getting some of those hand warmers you can buy from gas stations and put those in his carrier.
BeardedDragons,3c8n0j,WheresMyDietDrKelp,2,Sun Jul 5 23:33:40 2015 UTC,You could get a cheap light clamp and stick it on the side of his cage or a rubbermaid container if need be. Like this from home depot: http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/42/4293c45c-7098-4ffa-8e91-6f3a543fa771_400.jpg

They should be able to hook you up. I've heard of people using 3m command hooks to attach it to glass, if it's a permanently closed wire top, you can just run some 20 gauge or so wire around it, or bolt it through the wire mesh."

BeardedDragons,3c7hk3,chasingcars825,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"I was concerned about this same issue and posted here a couple weeks ago to ask about it. Here was the post.   Assuming a bearded dragon is properly cared for, it seems like droopy eyelids can just be a genetic thing. Mine looks pretty similar to yours and seems to be doing well. It doesn't seem like it's something that will go away though, as far as I have observed on mine. I didn't take my bearded dragon to a vet, but I did submit a fecal sample after I noticed the eye droop, and came back with nothing. I'm definitely no expert on bearded dragon care, but I think you probably don't  need to worry about it too much."

I know, there are tons of horror stories about this, but she absolutely loves Spyro! I've written up a care guide, I've shown her how to bathe him, feed him, and monitor him for anything. Besides, I'm only 45 minutes a way in case anything bad happens! I hate leaving him, but he's in great hands. Anyways, here's the photo of my last night with this guy for the next six weeks. I don't know what I'm more sad about... Leaving Spyro for 6 weeks, or leaving my family.  Well I guess both, since Spyro IS family :)"

I'm really sorry to bear such bad news, but he is likely suffering significantly. :(  The other reason I'm sorry I didn't see this sooner is because you need to follow an extreme sanitation protocol.  Do not touch any other lizards.  Anything in his tank needs to be destroyed, and the tank itself disposed of.  This is the most dangerous and deadly disease out there for beardies.  You should also let whomever you got him from know."

BeardedDragons,3bzsru,haleyp04,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:21:24 2015 UTC,Are you in the UK? I'm just wondering if there are any recommended places to buy the container from.
BeardedDragons,3bzsru,Leeloopants,5,Fri Jul 3 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"I just started a dubia roach colony. The setup is easy. I've got a sterilite tub with a hole and screen in the lid, with a heat emitter on their box and a Zilla thermostat set at 90 degrees so they don't get too hot. They will not breed at room temperature as they are a tropical species. Then just egg crates for them to live on, water crystals, standard roach chow, and I put fresh fruits and/or veggies in their box every day. You should feed them nutritious foods since you'll be feeding them to your dragon, not just potato and grain. NEVER leave food in their box for more than a day. Mold grows quickly in hot, humid environments and mold can wipe out your whole colony. I just give them scraps of whatever I make for dinner. They love apples, carrots, oranges, greens. They're kinda expensive to buy, so breeding them is definitely recommended. They have no smell, don't fly, jump or bite, and my dragon LOVES them. If one escapes, they cannot proliferate at the temperatures inside your home and will quickly die. You should definitely go for it!"

Some things to be wary of:   Avoid feeding them greens/weeds from your yard, as you never know what kind of weed killer/fertilizer might be on it.

In this image Yoshi is blocking the light for Chaos, this is a way to prevent him from getting bigger and could lead to MBD.  Chaos is also showing his stress marks at full darkness meaning he is very distressed.  I would read up a bit on beardie behavior, pretty much any assumptions made based on mammalian behavior are wrong.  Beardies are solitary and territorial, both sexes.  The videos you see are usually a bunch of very young lizards housed together by breeders and they are separated after a few months (i.e. when they get bigger).  Many times it is even necessary to keep them (adults) out of sight of one another.  It is fine when supervised for short periods, like when they are out and about etc to have them in the same area but they need to be housed separately.  They probably won't directly injure or fight each other though."
BeardedDragons,3bw6yf,Saint_The_George,2,Thu Jul 2 23:28:53 2015 UTC,i dont doubt u all at all. and i will for sure read up. but ive seen videos where they are feeding dubias to multiple beardies in one enclosure. maybe its just feeding for a vid?  im thinkin i even that dood on youtube that goes to shows and sells them. im pretty sure his name is Michael and from Florida. doing the same kinda feeding to several.   please educate me on what im not seeing here with the multiple beardies in a cage. i will try to put soyrce links in here. thanks alot for the heads up  but there were others and i could tell they were adults by size.  i also agree with Chaos looking stresed. and he came out of the container like that. so i figured he'd warm up in a day or two
BeardedDragons,3bw6yf,Saint_The_George,4,Fri Jul 3 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience keeping multiple beardies, so what I know is basically what I've said, it comes down to you and your beardies but I just wanted to warn that they do not behave or indicate at all like mammals and that it looks like Yoshi is bullying Chaos in this picture.  They have a fairly developed and specific ""language"" of behaviors and I found that guessing is basically useless; I also had to read up to understand what my little buddy was telling me.  I know a lot of youtube people like to put their beardies together for videos because they will interact and its interesting :) and there are probably some individuals where it just works out despite everything"
BeardedDragons,3bw6yf,Lobos42,2,Fri Jul 3 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"after today i agree with you on what they may be trying to tell you, i did think some of the behavior was friendlier than it seems to be. thankfully i've been able to monitor them alot over the past 2 days. and today i saw Yoshi's body puff up clearly bigger than when they are just basking and there was some mouth opening. after i saw that i did try to keep one out as often as possible. now Chaos is in a tote with a warming pad for the night."

BeardedDragons,3bw6yf,WheresMyDietDrKelp,4,Thu Jul 2 20:01:38 2015 UTC,The bigger dragon will start bullying the smaller one if he hasnt started already. Dont wait too long to separate them. People around here will highly recommend not housing any dragons together.
BeardedDragons,3bw6yf,WheresMyDietDrKelp,-1,Thu Jul 2 21:24:17 2015 UTC,it isnt bullying it so far. it runs up and licks it from time to time but i see Yoshi lick everything almost.  Whats up with the beardies that people are feeding in videos and there are like 5 in a tank? are they all the same sex? or would it even matter at all that Yoshi is a female (pretty confident after checking w flashlight)  how long do you think i might be aboe to keep them like this ?  i have seen the comments since i been here. but wife came home with Chaos as a suprise...  i also take them both out to be handled at the same time. i rub their backs. while each is in a hand at the same time. trying to be fair cause Yoshi did seem a little bothered when Chaos came here. Is there ways to help the cohabitate. im definitely a complete noob with reptiles. but i love animals alot. and i am a gentle giant with these things.  Yoshi is already to the point she wont jump off the bed or anything. and i can let her roam. which seems to be helping Chaos... who was clinging to her cagemate in Petsmart when my wife bought it.

Sometimes the red light can hurt their eyes and cause then to keep shutting their eyes.   The spiral uv bulbs are okay but should be replaced after six months.

I'm new to the whole bearded things so I want to learn as much as I can to give her the best life possible.  As for the bulb is one over the blue uva/uvb bulbs similar to a plant grow light.  So the florescent bulbs are OK read online that they may bother their eyes.  She is about 3 months old and she has a 40 gallon tank with a good basking spot close to heat lamps which are the white daylight similar house bulbs . Keep it at about 100f-110f during the day and about 75f at night. She has a hide and some reptile plants also. She has a bathing pond and water and pellet food dish. She also is fed 3 crickets a day with a supplement.   Is there anything in missing or should do. I really wanna make sure she is really well taken care of.
BeardedDragons,3bxsbu,Reservedtruthfinder,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"you need to feed her more, alot more.   When they are younger then need 80% live food and 20% greens,   She needs to have a bowl of salad/veg available at all times.   never feed her insects bigger than the length of the gap between her eyes because it may cause her to be impacted. if you buy the small baby crickets give (this may seem alot) 20-30, people usually say give them as many as they can eat in 10 minutes but iv'e never followed that rule and my beardie is healthy.   is she pooping okay? keep an eye on their poop pattern to make sure she's regular.   Wish the bathing pond and waterdish, be very careful, the humidity from the water in the tank may cause a respiratory infection. if you have a humidity thermometer keep the humidity between 35-40%.  no many people have many ideas that are generally speculations, i have the spiral bulbs, i always have so have a few people i know, and they also agree they are fine. Yet do need changing every 6 months or so. so it could be a bit more costly, depending where you buy your items from."
BeardedDragons,3bxsbu,theflyinglime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:56:52 2015 UTC,"Is she keeping the same eye shut or does she switch off? Sometimes they like to be lazy and only watch you with one eye. When hungry or eating, both eyes should definitely be open, though."
BeardedDragons,3bxsbu,Doritos_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"Coil or compact UVB lights are neither sufficient nor safe for bearded dragons. Coil lights tend to have streaking, and “hot” and dark spots. The good UVB rays are also depleted very rapidly in these bulbs. The “hot” spots in coils and compacts have been linked to photokeratoconjunctivitis, a serious eye issue. If allowed to continue, this can cause snow blindness, swelling, and infection. Do not use any brand of coil or compact UVB bulb.   From the Comprehensive Care Guide by /u/merlyn923 that is in the side bar.  I'd recommend giving that a read."

BeardedDragons,3bvmax,littlemiss_blondie,3,Thu Jul 2 14:51:46 2015 UTC,It's probably the mealworms.  One bad poop isn't anything to be concerned about - just keep an eye out for it being a regular thing.
BeardedDragons,3bvmax,merlyn923,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:52:57 2015 UTC,He has had meal worms plenty of times before but never from there. I keep seeing things online about how if it happens you should get it checked right away in case it is a parasite our something like that.
BeardedDragons,3bvmax,merlyn923,4,Thu Jul 2 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but think about it this way.  If you had an odd color/consistency poop once, would you rush off to the ER?  Or would you wait to see if it was maybe something you ate, or just your stomach having a bad day?  Same goes for dragons.  They're not fragile creatures constantly on the verge of death.  Like I said, I would watch and see if he does it several times in a row.  If it was just one time, or occasional, it's nothing to worry about. If his next 3, 4, 5 poops are like that, a fecal is probably in order for parasites.  Also, it takes more than the time between a meal and a poop for a heavy parasite load to take root in a dragon.  Watch the quality of his feces for the next few days, but I wouldn't rush to a vet just because of one soft poop.  On a side note, mealworms really aren't nutritionally valuable for beardies.  They have higher fat than crickets and roaches, and less protein than all of crickets, roaches, and superworms. It's sort of like the empty-calorie junk food of feeder insects.  Also, they pose a significant impaction risk in younger beardies (those under ~15"")."
BeardedDragons,3bvmax,merlyn923,2,Thu Jul 2 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. I feel a lot less worried.  And he only gets them on occasion. What would you suggest as a substitute other that crickets? I find them more difficult to keep alive and harder to feed to my dragon. He is a young dragon, probably about 8 months maybe. (Wasn't sure of age when I got him.) But he is about 18 inches long."
BeardedDragons,3bvmax,merlyn923,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"Are you willing to try out dubia roaches?  They're really the best feeder.  High in protein, low in fat, no noise, little to no smell, live a long time, easy to breed.  Superworms are also great as part of a healthy diet.  They're a bit fatty to be the only feeder used, but can definitely be used as a healthy component of diet. I personally use a mix of dubia and superworms for beardies."
BeardedDragons,3bvmax,MissWiggly2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:17:23 2015 UTC,My biggest concern is them getting out because I live in an apartment. But super worms will work? And do you know where I could buy them?

Hose it down when it's dry after coating it extremely well (multiple layers all dried over 24hrs each) to get the nasty extra chemicals off it and you should be ok.

If he's not warmed up it can cause overdose by quickly dumping into the blood stream as the body begins to warm instead of absorbing a steady amount into the blood stream.

He's been grumpy, getting really dark, won't eat much, and spends most of his time in his hide.  His tail is REALLY white as well. His face shedded about a week ago and nothing else.  Never gone through a shed before so it's super worrisome. (If that's even what's going on)  It makes me so happy though because the only time he gets bright yellow and loses his stress marks is when I'm handling him.  That must means that he likes me. :)"

I took her outside for the first time just a few minutes ago to our patio and she jumped out of my hand and tried to run off.  We joke that she's just in her awkward teenage years because Han was the same way at that age, just not as jumpy."
BeardedDragons,3bosrs,melbored11,2,Tue Jun 30 22:49:50 2015 UTC,Active or docile during the day time?   What are you feeding him?
BeardedDragons,3bosrs,Reservedtruthfinder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"Docile, today I just came home and he hadn't moved from where he slept last night. He seems to have gotten weaker (perhaps more appropriate term is less active) the last few weeks tho, especially when I shifted his meat to mealworms (thought he was looking under weight compared to other 6 month olds, so decided on more fat). Other diet, daily rocket, mustard leaf, carrot gut loaded crickets for ages. I know he was the last of that particular clutch, so maybe I got the small guy, but how can i ask that question politely? Feel im being paranoid also, since I took him to the Lizard expert at Lort Smith in Melbourne only few weeks ago, and he said he was tip top."
BeardedDragons,3bosrs,ozguy35,2,Wed Jul 1 06:05:52 2015 UTC,"If he is going into brumation you don't want him to be underweight. It may have consiquences. This may seem weird but I did it with my dragon when he was underweight after bringing him home from the store, you could even try baby food, that got my beardies weight up and his appetite back.   If you feel he is in a state of brumation pop him in a bath. Make sure you're with him at all times and massage his stomach and encourage him to poop if possible. (You don't want any poop inside if he goes into full brumation it will probably harm him)   You also don't want him to be dehydrated. So if possible try and give him water. Whether it's by a syringe or bathing him.   But I would advise a second visit to the vet just to be safe. Mainly if he's looking ubderweight that's not good for brunation.   Keep us updated. :)"

BeardedDragons,3bosrs,Reservedtruthfinder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:03:03 2015 UTC,In your OP you said your dragon weighed 5 grams. I'm sure you mis wrote that. Maybe meant 50?  50 grams if that's what you meant is still seems underweight for a 6 m/o.   Do you have any scales you could weigh him with?

So apart from the first day of having her, it was one night not to long ago I went to put her back into her tank to sleep, and she just grabbed onto my arm so hard and didn't want to let go. Brought her closer to my chest and she ran up my chest onto my shoulder. So I broke down and let her nap for a couple hours on me until I went to bed. She was to tired at that point to bother opening her eyes to see I was putting her back in the tank."
BeardedDragons,3bos2i,Fetusbong,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:05:41 2015 UTC,The prestory is i also wanted one for years and my wife suprised me 2 months ago. A week or two ago me and my kids were playing with yoshi and we were holding her for a while. her belly was feeling on the colder side since we have wood floors in a raised house. so i go to put her back and she just gripped on as if there was no way she wanted in. and as im sure we all have experienced... if theyre cold they will gladly walk onto their bask spot.  this was the face i got.  http://imgur.com/XP1FSQt  she stayed with me for another hour and then went back in to eat.

BeardedDragons,3booto,majorkurn,2,Tue Jun 30 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"personally, i'd say it really depends on the dragon as to how much you handle him, just take your queues from him, if he's seeming like he want's to get away, or he avoids your hands, back off for a while :)"

BeardedDragons,3bkmeq,Spipher,6,Tue Jun 30 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"I assume you are new to bearded dragons since this looks like shed. Shed is quite normal for dragons.   Mine is shedding right now. The reason you may have been worried is because when you think of shedding, you think of snakes. Snakes shed in one go and then its done. Unfortunately for our bearded friends its not as easy for them, since thsy shed in chunks. They go though a 'phase' of shed that can last up to a few weeks, where bits will shed over time. For most dragons it starts with there heads and goes down to the tail. Mine is shedding right now. Be has shed his head and front legs and his belly is the current part thats shedding.  You have to be patient and understanding with your dragon while he/she sheds, since its quite uncomfortable for them. The worst parts for them are the eyes, nose and vent. Because of how uncomfortable it can be, they are often grumpy or have lost their apatite, so don't worry too much.   Some dragons, specially the young ones, will shed every few weeks, while others can shed once or twice a year, like mine. He sheds once a year.  Judging by your pictures, the shed should start falling off in the next few days. There is nothing to worry about.  When the shed does start peeling, try not to pull it off. If you want to help, give him warm baths to soften the shed and gentally rub the shed. Rubbing it will help remove the shed that is ready to come off. If a piece is still attached firmly, leave it up to the dragon to remove himself when he feels like it. Also, make sure he has some wood or rough stones to rub against.   For more help, please refer to the guide in tbe side bar.  Hope I helped!  Also, your dragon is very pretty!  Edit: I suck at spelling  Edit 2: I really suck at spelling"

For moving I suggest keeping the car warm and lining a box with a towel and air holes. The heat pad can cause some burns (rare but possible) so if so be CAREFUL. Otherwise, again, I usually just use a towel and my car as warm as I can stand and she's usually happy with that. Its only a few hours so she should be fine as long as you don't ice out your car with A/C. And again, keep your beardy in the home you'll be at most. Depending on the length of time you'll be gone either just put lots of greens in and feed him lots of crickets the day you leave so hes full while you're gone, OR get a trusted friend/neighbor to feed him and play with him a bit every day that you're gone. Too much moving and change will stress him out"
BeardedDragons,3bkwrb,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"It won't ha e much effect. There may be some initial relocation stress, but even that may not happen. Make sure you're moving the complete set up each time, or, alternatively, have a complete set up at both locations. I've gone back and forth between two states 3-4 times during a year and had a complete set up at both spots.  For the physical journey, approximately nine hours one way, I used a soft sided animal carrying bag. I put a bunch of towels inside to make it cushy and tucked them in. I did not feed the day before travel. Since the temperature was never less than the minimum suggested keeping temperature of 65°f I didn't offer any heat. They slept the whole way. I tucked them in the viv, let them sleep until the next day when lights came on as normal. They never even seemed to notice anything different and were eating and behaving normally with immediacy."

BeardedDragons,3bjaet,MaddeyClare,2,Mon Jun 29 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"The cricket quencher will work for the colony. I've used it in mine. After that's gone, you can buy bulk water crystals, or just more quencher from your local pet store.  As for general needs for a colony, you will need a rubbermaid tote, egg crate, and something to put the chow/food and water crystals in. Really, that's it. Put in your breeders and keep them in a warm place (I keep mine in my laundry room) and they will start breeding!  Drill holes in the tote lid for ventilation and put a ring of clear packing tape midway up if you see that they are able to get a footing on the side of the tote.  Later on, a few 5 gallon buckets for sorting."
BeardedDragons,3bjaet,ishalfdeaf,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"In my experience water crystals are unnecessary as are food trays, I used both at first but experimented, as long as your bin is adequately vented and place the food on the top most crates it will not mold as long as you are not over feeding.  All the necessary water can come from moist veggies such as carrots and celery.  If I've gone a while between feelings I may soak the veggies to water log them before I throw them in.  Crystals and premium roach chow may help speed up establishment of the colony from breeders but likely not as big of a difference as an under tank heater would taped to the side of the bin.

BeardedDragons,3bjaet,ishalfdeaf,2,Mon Jun 29 19:19:34 2015 UTC,Here is the one I have. This seems to be the standard size most people get. It's tall enough to contain the large egg crates while still leaving enough room above them so the roaches can't touch the lid.
BeardedDragons,3bjaet,Got_Ants,2,Mon Jun 29 19:26:17 2015 UTC,caption may not look like much but there are over 1000 dubia in this 20 gallon long. With one birdie eating 10 a day they seem to never diminish the goal is letting them reproduce for about 4 months so that you always have new breeders.
BeardedDragons,3bjaet,Mach10X,2,Mon Jun 29 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping Dubia roaches for over 6 years now.  They are surprisingly easy to raise and care for and can take a lot of neglect once they are established (like 2 weeks at a time with no interaction if necessary).  You'll want to use a plastic storage bin such as this: http://images.justplasticboxes.com/32779-sterilite-18-gallon-lapis-tote-pack-of-8_1_640.jpg  I use an 18 gallon but you can go as big or as small as you like but you'll have more stable colony with a larger bin.  Be sure that the inside of the bin has a glossy finish.  Unfortunately Rubbermaid doesn't seem to fit the bill and baby roaches are light enough to climb out of them, I recommend sterelite, make sure the bin is opaque.  I've tried lots of ways of venting my bins (humidity leads to mold).  If you live in a dry climate cut out about a quarter up to a half of the lid away.  I live I a very humid city so I cut out over 3/4 of the lid away leaving a rim.  I then use a staple gun to affix aluminum window screen to the underside of the bin, you'll want to shoot the staple against something wood then bend the staple down on the top of the lid to avoid sharp points, you can then leave the staples as is or cover them in duct tape or caulking.  I can't stress how important it is that you try to prevent getting flies in your bin if you plan on keeping it indoors.  Aluminum window screen is tough, very breathable and will effectively keep out pests.  If a staple gun isn't your style you can use hot glue but it's messy and takes far longer.  If you use hot glue you'll want a wooden dowel or skewer to hold the screen down in the glue, you can speed up the cooling with an ice cube.  Be sure to rough up the plastic with a knife or coarse sandpaper before you start gluing.  To fill your bin all you need are egg filler flats.  I did a lot of research and in the issue eggboxes.com was the best price and had free shipping I believe.  As for food all you need is dry dog or cat kibble and some high moisture veggies such as celery, squash, carrots etc.  you can use cricket water cubes or water crystals but I've found it a big waste of time and money.  We've split our colony many times for friends and they are thriving on nothing big but pet kibble and veggies.  When you're starting out you'll want to keep your bin above 85F but no higher than 97F.  There is a sweet spot where breeding is maximized.  Once your have a well established colony you can lower the temp to slow breeding to match your needs.  Once every 6-12 months you will need to clean out the bin and cull the weak roaches and reduce the colony size.  I do this by first allowing the colony to go 10-14 days with no food or water, I then place 1 or 2 fresh egg filler flats on top of the old flats and place fresh veggies on top, within a few minutes the flat will be swarming with hungry dubias.  Slowly and carefully place the flats into a second temporary bin.  Repeat until all that are left are the weak and dying roaches that are unable to climb to the top.  You can similarly stop once you hit a certain number if your colony has grown too large, consider seeing if anyone would like the rest, be sure to dump the rest into a heavy duty trash bag and spray inside thoroughly with roach killer or if it's winter time and below freezing leave them outside for a week then dispose of them in  the trash.  Feel no remorse, you can do it, they are cockroaches after all."
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,Love4theBeard,5,Mon Jun 29 22:07:09 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't use peroxide.  It will destroy healthy tissue along with the damage.  You need Betadine (providone iodine) instead, diluted to the color of weak tea. Also, hopefully this doesn't need saying, but don't put your beardie and your gerbil near each other."
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,merlyn923,2,Mon Jun 29 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"Wash the peroxide off. Soap and water is always best in cleaning situations. I would leave it be once washed. Put him in a clean tank for now separate from any others and with no sand/gravel/anything that could get in the wound. Put some greens in with him (they don't kick back when eaten) and give him a log/rock and something to hide in along with his heat lamp. Then leave him alone over night in a quiet undisturbed place. Tomorrow pull him out, check him over and check the scratch. If it needs cleaned, clean it with mild soap and warm water rinsing it COMPLETELY. If its healed enough that you think nothing will get in it then you can put him back in the sand/gravel/whatever you have. If not leave him in the one without. He will scratch without anything to dig in. But its better than getting infected and risking his life. Only put him back in when you feel its safe to do so. If hes big enough and doesn't run too fast bring him into the sun tomorrow because sunlight instead of uv heat lamps usually is all around better and will help him heal. Hope this helps. Give me an update when you can! Source: I owned a beardy with an abscessed broken jaw that was too destroyed to heal due to incompetent previous owners. Lived with it til she died at the ripe old age of 11. Aka she was old AF"
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:42:11 2015 UTC,Thank you all when my husband came home from work he knew what to do.My dragon still don't trust me it hisses at but I have to regain its trust
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,doublepulse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:15 2015 UTC,My husband wants to get a female for Mr.Spiky.My husband thinks that Mr.Spiky is lonely because he barely eats and he is constantly looking at his reflection through the glass. I say he is still a baby and still adjusting to his surroundings.Yes Mr. Spiky has already sheared about three times since we got him in April; yet and still he is still a baby.My fear is that they will attack each other; am I wrong for having these feelings? Let me know what do you think.
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:03:01 2015 UTC,"Bearded dragons are solitary creatures in the wild- they are extremely territorial and can become violent towards either sex. Some people have housed females together with varied success. A female bearded dragon with Mr. Spiky won't make him any less ""lonely"" and he is likely staring at his own reflection thinking it is another dragon. By housing a female in with him you are putting both dragons at risk to fight for food, light, warmth, and title of dominant lizard. One is likely to thrive and the other may perish. And if it doesn't come to that Mr. and Mrs. Spiky will likely make a whole family of Lil' Spikies that you'll either have to take care of or cull.  Instead try keeping him mentally stimulated with fake plants for his enclosure and a nice background. Both of my boys like watching videos on my laptop and become interested in listening to different sounds (loud ones are scary though.) Every once in a while I'll feed them a different type of food as a treat (phoenix worms, small slice of skinless grape, small piece of cucumber.) If your beardie is acting terrified you'll need to establish trust again and it'll probably take weeks to make solid strides. Don't grasp and grab at him, just put your hand inside the cage slowly for a few minutes at a time. Move a little closer each day. Don't try to pick him up unless it is absolutely necessary for a few weeks. I've never picked either of mine up from above and always gently slide my fingers under them. ""The dragon is holding me, I am not holding the dragon,"" is the idea (if they try to dive out of my hand make a loose cave around them.)   My best advice for all pet owners is to use the animals wants and needs as a way to figure out how to make them healthiest, happiest, and associate you with enjoyment."
BeardedDragons,3bk7i0,t3hcyclops,0,Tue Jul 7 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"Also. Keep the gerbil away from the reptile. Most warm blooded creatures have a huge distrust of cold blooded. Cats and domestic foxes will never trust you again if you handle a reptile with them around. If you want to personally soothe him, hold him on your chest or arm while watching a movie or just chilling and pet him softly"

I'll leave the screw pattern up to you but it should be pretty easy. If you're not sure, add another screw. I'll also leave the glass attachment up to you. I'd try the hardware store and talk to someone about glass hinges. You'd want something that the beardie can't push open accidentally. Hope you enjoy. Keep me updated!"

BeardedDragons,3bj8xm,soupy56,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:19:50 2015 UTC,I could change the model if you'd like. All that would really need to be done would be changing those 1.5' in the Side section cut to 2.0'. The three shelves and the tops and bottom would really only need to change.

BeardedDragons,3bjbtp,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:37:05 2015 UTC,Put a piece of bread in with the crickets and a lil tiny bit of water. I've always fed my beardy the dead ones as soon as I can by swinging them in front of her eye a few inches away til she attacks it. Seems to do fine and has for both beardys I've had. Currently im caring for my SOs but my original one I got because this idiot broke her jaw and I always had to clean her abscess in her face and freshly dead crickets didn't hurt her jaw
BeardedDragons,3bjbtp,ForeverFoxyLove,2,Mon Jun 29 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I have the food and water covered so it's probably just a little too cramped in the cricket keeper or something.  It is extremely dry here (Colorado at 5300ft, plains side) so maybe that has an impact"
BeardedDragons,3bjbtp,Quixeh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:12:59 2015 UTC,Just dangle the dead ones and keep em moving and your beardy should eat them fine. Its just like feeding dried crickets but with more protein and moisture since they don't exactly drink water
BeardedDragons,3bjbtp,turd_lurk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"In combination with what others have said, we've found that space (we decant them into smaller tubs with a bit of the egg crate like you'd get from the pet shop but fewer crickets per box) and temperatures (don't keep them above the viv! About 60F works for us) are vital in keeping the bulk of them alive. Probably still get 20% die, maybe more towards end of 3 weeks."
BeardedDragons,3bi4oc,sg4rb0sss,3,Mon Jun 29 12:24:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bathe her in ReptiBoost.  It won't do a thing.  That needs to be administered orally or through the directions given on the package.

BeardedDragons,3bi4oc,merlyn923,4,Mon Jun 29 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but beardies don't really absorb significant quantities of liquid through the vent, and none at all through the vent.  I'm not sure what soaking is going to do at all.  Same goes for the misting you're doing, which also increases humidity in the cage.   It does sound like brumation or shedding woes to me.  See how she does after the shed.  Some beardies are sort of hard-wired to brumate during the Australian winter, even if it's summer here."

I worked where I bought him from, and he always let my hold him there but ever since I brought him home he doesn't like to be handled. Just now for the first time he stopped opening his moth when he is in my hand and let me pet his back and top head...  I think he only allowed it because I sat him in my chest first then my hand..  I'm just worried he hates me."
BeardedDragons,3bcoa6,Kat1yn,5,Sun Jun 28 01:15:09 2015 UTC,KEEP HANDLING HIM! He's probably just adjusting to a new home like any animal would. If you stop handling him he may become indifferent to you and other humans if you invite your friends to hold him. The more you handle him the more he'll bond with you. Mine didn't seem to like it much but let me hold him when I first got him (I got him at 4 wks too) and now (3 weeks later) he runs across his tank to see me. I make sure I hold mine every day to bond with him.
BeardedDragons,3bcoa6,rubyzebra,3,Sun Jun 28 02:40:03 2015 UTC,Keep an article of your clothing that has been worn in your beardie's cage. It'll help him get used to your scent.

What I found that was a nice, concise list, and seems to match what pretty much everyone recommends is this list on BeardedDragon.org  Decided where you're going to buy things; the tank is easiest to buy locally as they're fragile and don't ship well. Everything else? Local or mail order - your preference.  Make yourself a list and figure out where you're going to buy everything. Don't forget tax and/or shipping. That will get you pretty damned close.  Also, don't forget something to keep live food in. You can buy ""cricket keepers"" or you can use a 10g aquarium with a screen top. I had an empty 10g, so I just put a screen top on it."

BeardedDragons,3bdrxe,DylanOakes,2,Sun Jun 28 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"I would suggest against those ""full kits"".

Spyro was expensive (according to the breeder he's a rare variety, which is absolute bullshit and I got scammed) and I got a very large tank and a bunch of backup supplies as well. I recommend having a bunch of bulbs with you to begin, so you can easily change them when needed.   EDIT: The tank itself is 108 gallons, which is probably too big. It's really high as well, which means a more expensive heating bulb, and I had to get a heating pad just to bring the overall temperature up. It also just cost me about $100 to switch from sand (which was VERY expensive to buy and also a stupid move) to a bunch of tiles. Please don't downvote me just because I've used sand. I hate when people do that. Yes, I've switched from sand to tile."

When I said yes and started looking in the box saw this messed up dragon and while I was looking at it, the person left. The poor dragon has severe mbd and probably never had any calcium or uvb. Had the store vet check it out, tried giving it liquid calcium, but he is unable to swallow. After a few days of struggling with him and attempting everything we could and him in obvious pain, he was put down. Im just venting I guess cause this really pretty guy wasn't taken care of and we see it all the time at our store and it gets old."

BeardedDragons,3bargv,iheartbananapancakes,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:59:06 2015 UTC,i would recommend a nice tile. Looks great and cant harm your beardie
BeardedDragons,3bargv,boredENT9113,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:06:29 2015 UTC,I've never considered that!  Is there an issue with the tile and temperature control?
BeardedDragons,3bargv,iheartbananapancakes,2,Sat Jun 27 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"Actually the tile retains heat very well, ive never had any issues of the sort. The tile also helps to keep your beardies nails trimmed. For my beardie, i have repticarpet, and tile on top of that. Almost everyone on this sub would recommend tile. Also they would warn you that sand and other loose substrates are not advisable. Your beardie can eat the sand and become impacted."
BeardedDragons,3bargv,boredENT9113,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:17:49 2015 UTC,Good old fashioned paper towels. I'm going to put tile in his new one when I get it built next month though.

The skin would become discolored first and I know they will claw and mess with their skin to get the old stuff off. The tail will look more black or injured if it's tail rot I think. I thought my beardie had tail rot about a month ago, but he was just shedding 😊"
BeardedDragons,3bd5bq,mandaleann,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:15:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that she is biting herself is very worrisome.  I would get her to a vet.  It may be an infection spreading, but the self-inflicted bites are really bothering me.  It's a very abnormal behavior; either she's in some discomfort or there's something bigger going on."
BeardedDragons,3bcl8k,atomiclolz,2,Sat Jun 27 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you could be describing the colour changes they exhibit naturally. Going darker isn't only just a threat/stress signal but also used to absorb more heat quickly.   I would double check their temperatures first off, your home or viv placement may be significantly colder than your friends, or some heating may have been damaged in transport."
BeardedDragons,3bcfx4,AlexisDreamer,2,Sat Jun 27 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"No.  Ladybugs are at least mildly toxic to beardies.  I'm not sure about savs.  Also, if you're going bioactive, beardies and savs will need xeric (desert) soils and microfauna, which are relatively difficult to find. Ladybugs do not belong in that sort of set up."

I wasn't planning on buying one but my dad's friend's brother got a divorce, and neither of them wanted to take the beardie. So there is a good chance I'll take care of her/him if no one else takes it in. But I didn't know I would get so attached to him :P"
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,Syraphia,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"I think the best place to start is to list out everything about your setup. So I'm going to list the questions out as well as link you to the Comprehensive Care Guide in the sidebar.    What are your temperatures for basking, hot, and cold side of the cage? What is your lighting setup?  What are you feeding in terms of veggies?  Tank size?  Dietary supplements?    I think those are the main things to be answered. I can already see you have a tile substrate. Out of curiosity, how big and old is he?   I will say that you need to remove the crickets that he doesn't eat due to what you said in another comment about the crickets biting and chewing on him. I think he also needs a hide."
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,086bagofcats,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"Have you relocated him to your house, they can suffer from relocation stress that in turn stresses out us as new owners. Basically they troll us by not eating/pooping or behaving! If he's quite thin and you're very worried you can buy some squash/veg baby food (check the ingredients) and pop a little on his nose and he will hopefully lick it off. If it's been a good while since he had protein (live food), then introduce it back very gradually.   I presume you've had help re his set up etc?"
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,086bagofcats,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"It's been almost 2 months since we brought him to my house, so I don't think  it's stress. He did this at the school too.   I put in veggies daily but they just crumble up and dry. He poops once every 2 days so he's eating some crickets at least, I don't know what a thin beardie would look like, so here's a picture of him: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xmvonxmlx1l4xnd/Photo%20May%2024%2C%2012%2022%2048%20PM.jpg?dl=0  here's a picture of him in a fabulous cowboy hat too:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/a3r3y3sb1k7wxqw/Photo%20May%2022%2C%202%2040%2049%20PM.jpg?dl=0  It's hard to introduce the crickets gradually because when I put them in, I use the type of cage where they will climb up tubes and you pop the ones in the tubes down. So I can't really get 3 or 4 in.   A lot of time there will just be cricket corposes lying around, so I had to start putting in cricket food (those orange cube things) by them then taking them out once they dry. They still die but not as frequently. Smells awful too.  This is his cage, it is messy I know but I clean it out every Sunday: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8303lba2xy7qso9/Photo%20Jun%2027%2C%205%2002%2048%20PM.jpg?dl=0  I have many more structures/buildings for him, but he doesn't show intrest and it gives a place for the crickets to hide. I had a thick stick that helped him get up to his hammock, but the crickets would go up it and start chewing on him and basically livng on him, but he wouldn't eat them. I took it off and he can still get up their just fine.   Also, I just thought of something. His flooring is tiles so that when he poops, I can just take it out and replace it. Everytime he moves around it makes a pretty distinctive noise, is it possible that he doesn't move because he doesn't like the noise or it hurts his claws?"
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,Syraphia,2,Sat Jun 27 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"firstly, re the crickets, i would suggest that any uneaten crickets are taken out especially overnight. We dont actually feed steve in his viv, we take him out and feed him on our kitchen floor, using tongs to dip the food in the calcium or vitamins and dropping them one by one. However steve went off crickets completely on us after getting pinworms last year so now he eats locusts and morio worms, locusts are way easier to handle than crickets too. I believe some beardies can get bored of their live food, have you tried locusts or dubias? By taking the crickets out or feeding elsewhere you can maybe put a wee hide or some fake leafy vines in his viv and see if he utilises it more.   we have found also that our (very stubborn!!) steve will only really eat squash, he doesn't show any interest in any other veg. some people will pop a few worms under the leafy veg and see if the movement will help them eat it.   He looks ok, what do his poops smell like, has he had a vet visit or a fecal test lately? Weigh him and keep an eye on his weight. The smell of his poops and/or a weight drop can be indicators of parasites that need vet treatment. I do think his nails look a little long? do you think the tiles spook him? A little kitchen roll under the tiles to stop them wobbling might help."
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,Syraphia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"thank you for your reply. he used to eat turnip greens a lot but again he just doesn't eat it. his poop used to smell extremely strong, but then the smell got better until it didn't smell too bad. Since he is for school, no one had time to take him to the vet and get his nails clipped. I plan on changing that and I am happy to take him to get his nails clipped and checked by a vet.   If we put him on a flat surface with crickets, he won't chase them, making the crickets start to live in our home.  But we have a minature cage, a little longer than he is, could we put crickets in there and then put him in? Or would that stress him out?   Sometimes I wonder if the tiles hurt his feet or spook him, and I wouldn't be suprised if they did. I want to switch to sand or anything other than tiles but I'm not sure my teacher would like that. And with the long nails, that could easily hurt his claws when he walks. And it might explain why he doesn't move much.  I don't know if I already said, but I ordered 100 super worms and I'm praying he'll like them. He loves meal worms but I don't feed them to him anymore because they can damage his digestive organs n stuff.   he doesn't show enthusiasm about anything.  And about the roaches: I want to start using roaches so bad, they seem so much better but my mom won't let me cause they're creepy.   Someone else said that he might be used to hand feeding, and that could be right. During the school year he did this too, but I would lead the crickets to him instead of hand feeding (since he wouldn't hunt them).  He might of gotten used to that, but when I try that strategy he doesn't even eat them. Unless he is bored and they are like, inches away standing still.   Funny story time (this was when he ate some crickets): Since he wasn't eating crickets, I was irritated so I picked him up and would hold him in front of the crickets, he just started eating them like a vaccum cleaner. It was so funny."
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,Syraphia,2,Sat Jun 27 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"Quick note: DON'T switch to sand. That is the last substrate you're going to want to stick him on. I've got my Tatsuya on tile and everyone is happier. They don't normally live on sand like you would put into a cage, they live on hard, compacted earth and he'll end up eating more sand than not, which can lead to a impacted beardie. A rough tile (I use sealed, ceramic-style slate) will also help keep their nails short if you have concerns about that.   Use the smaller cage for crickets, definitely. He'll get used to the routine eventually. Most beardies don't show a lot of enthusiasm for a lot of things other than food. They also have a tendency to stay in one spot for long periods of time, case in point, I'm sure that Tatsuya has been on top of his rock for at least three hours currently, basking. He hopped down once and got some of his greens. So them not moving much isn't alone an indicator of an issue."

BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,086bagofcats,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answering these, this definitely will help.   Sounds like the cage is a 40 Gal breeder, which is the smallest size for an adult beardie, that's fine.   His basking is 95? I feel like that's a few degrees cool off the top of my head, but 95 sounds all right. How hot is the cool side? And what does the temp drop to at night when you turn the lights off?   I recognize that second lightbulb. That is a UVB bulb and it is insufficient. This could easily be affecting his want to eat anything. This is the bulb you want. Which will require a new fixture, something like this is good.   How long ago has that UVB bulb been changed? Because they need to be changed every so often, depending on the bulb. If the UVB is old and not outputting UVB, they're not going to want to eat. I'd suggest getting the light and fixture there. I think the specifics are outlined in the care guide in the sidebar."
BeardedDragons,3bc0pc,086bagofcats,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"it took an entire month to get a response like this... thank you so much. I'll look into ordering them.  When the light go out his basking area is about 70 degrees. I don't know how hot the cool side gets but I'll check tomorrow (He is sleeping right now).  I hope this works, thank you so much.  (also his name is morgoth)"
BeardedDragons,3bbmqj,DrGrumples,3,Sat Jun 27 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"The TLDR is that your lights are too far away.  The long answer is that energy radiating from a source (i.e. the lightbulbs) follows the inverse square law, meaning that the intensity of the energy is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.  All that sounds very complicated but it basically means that 2 inches away from a point source the same energy is now spread over 4 square inches of area i.e. much less densely then when concentrated to a single point.  All this means is that you can either increase the intensity or decrease the distance, but at that height you need a very powerful bulb to be effective.  Don't worry too much about being too close or too hot either as long as there is a basking area with a good range of temps and as long as he can cool off in another area he'll be fine.  I would say 6-8"" for a 75W bulb and especially for the uvb probably under 7"" is best.  The difference between a 75w and a 100w bulb at the distance shown is insignificant, this is why you didn't see much of a difference in temp.  tl;dr: lower the lights or raise (or add taller furniture) the basking area to w/i 6-8""   edit: if you haven't I would buy an IR thermometer (30$ at Lowes/Home Depot) its much more accurate and you can instantly measure the temps throughout the habitat. Also here is a visual of the inverse square law"
BeardedDragons,3bbmqj,Saint_The_George,5,Sat Jun 27 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! You figured they would sell equipment that would actually be beneficial to bearded dragons when they market it as such. I'll see about raising the floor of the cage so the rest of it is higher, this is very good to know when I build his next cage. Do you think you could help me get some good dimensions for the build? Lowes near me lets me get different types of glass cut at any size I want. So I can caulk it and maybe put a decorative trim on it. I bought this setup because it had everything I needed to buy anyway for cheaper, but now I see why.  Thanks for your help!  Edit: Drogon seems to be thankful!!!  http://imgur.com/tZ5sRRi"

BeardedDragons,3bbmqj,Saint_The_George,3,Sat Jun 27 19:58:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! he appreciates it haha
BeardedDragons,3bbmqj,Saint_The_George,2,Sat Jun 27 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, I did exactly the same thing with a NatGeo case, ended up replacing the bulbs, getting an extra light and changing the substrate to tile hahaha. The other thing I notice is everything for reptiles has a picture of a beardie on it despite being designed specifically for jungle pets or being a UVA lamp or whatever.  They will sell you anything for any reason they can ;).  As far as size I would go anywhere from 36x16 at the small end to 48x24 at the large end.  If you're not very DIY inclined there is a step by step build guide, but I assume since you are intending to build you are good with that.  The design I would use would be swinging glass front door, 3 sides and floor from melamine or plywood (minimize reflections and glass surfing) and hardware cloth for the top (its metal but has large holes to let light pass through).  As for height beardies do like to climb so it's good to have some furniture at different heights, me terrarium is 18"" tall and that seems good, gives me about 10-12 inches of height to put stuff in.  I really like doors that hinge and allow you to open the whole front of the enclosure  rather than sliding or or pulling the top off and moving your lights every feeding.  Good luck! you seem like a very responsible beardie parent and I'm sure you guys will do great!"
BeardedDragons,3bbmqj,Saint_The_George,2,Sat Jun 27 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"I'm actually very handy and love DYI. However I love the enclosure they built, I might take the general idea and build my own from their design. I'm excited to be a parent. Our new apartment we are moving to won't accept cats or dogs, and my girlfriend hasn't been without a cat since she was born (Our two cats are going to live with her parents!). So she wanted a fluffy pet that worked with our apartment (ended up with a bunny).  We were in the pet shop and an associate saw me say the bearded dragons were cute and made me hold one. That was a couple months ago, I knew I was going get one. I went to pet smart the other day and I saw this green little guy, and I HAD to have him!!! So I came home with Drogon!

I went to check out some green anoles as I was looking into doing a bioactive terrarium but when I walked by the reptile display The George ran up to the glass and looked me right in the eye so I had the attendant introduce us and that was that!  I like that design in general, it's a good starting point, my only mods would be hardware cloth and hinges, plus there's only so much you can do with essentially a box lol  watch the rabbit near electrical cables, my step sister had one and it ate every single wire on the floor that it was allowed to run around on (a dozen lamps in several rounds, 2 laptop chargers, numerous phone chargers etc) the thing was a menace haha  Double sexy legs"

I do have an insane amount of animals though, so my dogs have been exposed to everything from hedgehogs and rats, to pythons and even my tarantula. It's all about socialisation and taking it slow. Always try to make the experience positive. Maybe start out with letting the dogs watch your beardie through the terrarium...that way nothing bad could happen,worst case scenario, and when they become desensitised to that, start bringing him out to sit on your shoulder while the dogs are near by? Also, letting the dogs and beardie smell each other on your hands will help a lot. They will start to associate the smell of the other critters with you"

I'd recommend either reptile carpet or wood chips. You'll also want some decor, like logs or hides to give the vivarium a more wild feel. A thermostat is also needed, to regulate the temperature of the viv, as well as a UVB light bulb which should only be on during the daytime.

BeardedDragons,3b3k6c,merlyn923,4,Thu Jun 25 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, dismiss all the people with a ton of experience because you think it's a ""myth.""  Would you believe me if I showed you pictures of mealworm impactions in juveniles?  How about nutritional details? Like I said, I'm not worried about the impaction risk with an adult too much, but it's like feeding your beardie nothing but junk food. Here's a nice little chart.  Mealworms have less protein, less calcium, and more fat than both dubia and crickets.  Superworms are also high in fat, but at least they have a ton of calcium and protein."
BeardedDragons,3b3k6c,merlyn923,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"I would feed locusts every other week perhaps as well as using vitamin powders on the worms.

I'm simply trying to figure out monthly costs, because otherwise I simply won't get a bearded dragon. If it goes over 15 quid a month, though I'd like to spend around 10 or 12."
BeardedDragons,3b3k6c,merlyn923,3,Thu Jun 25 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"For an adult dragon, you should be able to feed on that budget.  I would seriously consider looking into breeding dubia - they're really easy to care for, and after your initial start up costs and a few months to get the colony going, all it costs is a some laying chicken feed and an occasional bag of water crystals.  Mealworms are not, however, a viable alternative to healthy feeders."

I'm awfully keen on getting a Bearded Dragon, but, the more I look into it the worse it gets for me. The initial costs are all fine, but the upkeep is what's bothering me the most. Spending so much on live insects will really start eating into my money since I'm 16, I just get pocket money each month."

It is likely, that if you hand feed him, he is associates your hands with food, and goes to get a snack but realizes that it is your hand. I can be wrong, I'm not exactly an expert, but I'd hate for him to bite you one day."
BeardedDragons,3auxxk,artisanz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:51:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, he definitely does :) I've somewhat intentionally trained him that way; I read before I got him that: hand feeding can get you bitten, because of the association of food with your fingers. So I simply never hand feed him. He lazily sits there before licking me when I reach into his cage to pet him/ pull him out.  As opposed to when I actually feed him: his crickets always come out of a white container filled with calcium powder. I shake em up and tip the container, and the crickets all bail ship. This container he has specifically associated with food (the Pavlov effect) - he knows what the white container means, and he gets up and moves to the center of the cage to chase them as they all jump out.  One lick of my hand means: I'm in a good mood. You can touch me.  No lick of my hand means: I'm in a grumpy mood, don't touch me. When I pick him up anyways, he resists, and goes slightly black beard out of annoyance lol. I think he has only bitten me once, and that was a mistake. I tried to push a rasberry into his view from behind a stick, and then he missed the rasberry lol"
BeardedDragons,3auxxk,Ki11erPancakes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:53:57 2015 UTC,The George likes to ride on my hand and/or explore my desk while I play video games.  He always tries to get up to my shoulder/head if I pick him up also haha.  Never had an issue with hand feeding and he only resists being picked up occasionally (mostly if he's shedding).  He likes to ride on my hand while I bring him to all the cricket hiding spots but I don't do that too often cause I don't want him to be THAT lazy XD

BeardedDragons,3awqw3,Burgerkingaka,2,Wed Jun 24 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"A) a day or so of not eating is not a huge deal. Did you just get her? Relocation stress is a real thing and can take some time. If the habitat, care, food offered, etc is correct then this should right itself soon enough.  B) not a huge deal but we generally don't recommend mealworms especially for younger dragons. They are more Chitinous and harder to digest and less nutritionally complete, but again not a huge deal.  C) .... If you do not know the temps of the basking spot and other areas, then you do not in fact know that they are adequate. Beardies require the correct temperatures to properly digest food. Also they shouldn't be too close to UVB sources as that can and likely will cause eye issues. What kind of bulb are you using? That plays a big role too.  D) have you read the care guide and other resources in the side bar? They are extremely helpful for new and experienced owners alike."
BeardedDragons,3awqw3,bongllama,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:38:20 2015 UTC,"A) No, I've had her for two weeks. B) I thought you could feed a couple at a time and it would be fine. C) I agree with you on this, but I don't have access to a laser thermometer. D) No, I haven't Ill take a look!, Thanks!"
BeardedDragons,3awqw3,bongllama,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"How often has she eaten and defecated in the two weeks you've had her? Are you familiar with how to check for signs of impaction/have you checked? Like I said the worms usually aren't a big deal it's just recommended to use a better option. Infrared thermometers are very cheap and extremely handy, I highly recommend picking one up soon, or even a probe thermometer. Proper temperatures are definitely one of the first things to look at when considering many issues. I would make reading the care guide and getting a thermometer your top priorities. If you do all your research and get everything up to par and problems persist then going to a vet is the next step."
BeardedDragons,3awqw3,Lobos42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:12:55 2015 UTC,She has pooped a ton. I don't think she is impacted because of her pooping everyday. I definitely will pick up a thermometer.
BeardedDragons,3awqw3,auryncharm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:17:47 2015 UTC,"When was the last time she defecated? If its been awhile she may be impacted and you need to take care of that immediately! If indeed her temps arent what they need to be she could be struggling to digest that hard chitin on the meal worms.   If everything else is ok, she may just be tired of the same food. And may be just being picky and wants something else. This is of course if everything else is proven to be ok. Mine dragons sometimes skip a meal or two if they are going through heavy shedding. Its def not often but it has happened.  First things first get to walmart or home depot or something like that and get a $10 thermometer and get her basking temps."
BeardedDragons,3avgf4,kirin_fucker,3,Tue Jun 23 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"Set up a dubia colony.    If you have a baby, then buy 100ish extra large/adult dubias, and 2k in smalls.  Get a 27 gallon plastic tote, cut a couple of small air holes in the top, hot glue insect mesh over the holes.  Stand up half a dozen egg cartons, put some carrots in and call it a day.  Feed off the small roaches and you should have a good size colony going by the time you go through the whole 2k.  2k small roaches $55 100 Extra Large $25   Tote $10  Way cheaper than crickets, and better for your dragon."
BeardedDragons,3avgf4,Dravorak,2,Wed Jun 24 00:09:38 2015 UTC,Even if you do not set up a colony (my wife has strictly forbid it because she irrationally fears I would cause an infestation) Dubia's are still far more economical than crickets.      More meat for your beardie / $  Less dead loss as they can live for < 1 year if you feed and water 'em  Easier for beardie to catch (i use a steep sides pyrex bowl to serve them so they don't hide all over the tank).

BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,2,Wed Jun 24 06:55:17 2015 UTC,"What really baffles me is you said 'reputable breeder' but your animal, a hatchling, has parasites!!  How can no other person responding be shocked or point out this issue???  Parasitic worms in a hatchling? Serious red flag, either from yourself, or the vendor, I don't know of any worm parasite that would transfer to offspring,"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,merlyn923,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"The vet told us the worms likely originated with the crickets the dragons eat (which come from a specialized pet shop). I'm contemplating getting them online instead, though."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,0,Wed Jun 24 06:55:12 2015 UTC,"There is little to no chance of that. That would mean the farmer, or the store, has parasites. And I am fairly certain worms that would be able to infest an animal, would be too big to be in crickets. Not to mention, farmed insects are done in a fairly clean environment, with clean sources of food and water, so that sounds like an ill-informed vet.  If it came from the crickets, than numerous animals would have an issue, and in this day and age you would probably hear about others with sick animals making note of it, and of the source.  Parasites just don't happen. They just don't appear. I work at the biggest national feeder farm, and the world's biggest human grade insect farm, and we have NEVER had a parasitic outbreak in the crickets. It would make no sense to sell infested feeders and get sued or loose all your business, I imagine you are American, and it might be more relaxed there, but that's just a load of crap it came from the feeders.  In terms of sources, the most likely. You - if you are reusing items from other animals, outside, or bought used and didn't thoroughly sterilize. Breeder - same reasons. Feeders from Store - same reason Feeder Farm - same reason  But if it came from the stores feeders or the feeders before the store got it, you would think more people would be affected.  Have you asked around locally? Local social media?   We've had vendors try to blame us for issues, and it's never true. Just trying to pass the blame.  Obviously there's a chance of anything. But the most likely is the source of the animal or the home of the animal. And in this day a captive bred animal having worms is a huge mistake on someone's part. Hell myself alone I've imported nearly 30 animals from Africa, wild caught, and haven't had an outbreak. Doesn't mean none of them had anything when they landed, but they all get treated anyway and quarantined."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,2,Wed Jun 24 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely ridiculous. Crickets are known throughout the reptile community to be one of the leading sources of pinworms and coccidia.  Look at any forum dedicated to insect eating lizards and you will find this brought up constantly.  Yes, big cricket breeders tend to have a clean stock. Pet stores? Not so much. Most people buy feeders at pet stores too. Or they breed at home, which is just as bad if the stock came in infected. Why do you think it's such a bad idea to feed wild insects to your pet? The two ""p""s - poisons and parasites."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,jsorrel1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:57:19 2015 UTC,"... Sell over a million crickets a week, for at least the past 200+ weeks give or take a couple. ZERO parasites from the feeders.  Where do you think pet stores get their stock? Farms or distributors, who get from farms. To say that stores are the issue, or the feeders, when OP themselves said after some research the issue is probably from where they got the animal, is fairly ridiculous. Maybe ten years ago feeder parasites were an issue, but today it's far more likely you are getting animals sick from the source, or from someone's mistake, not from the food."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,merlyn923,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:07:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight. I'm in the EU, so not American. And everything in the terrarium was new and unused, straight from the store and packaging.  That means the most likely source is indeed the breeder. Just yesterday I met a fellow (friend of a friend) who wasn't a big fan of the breeder in question - a little too late. I'll definitely keep this in mind for the future, however.  The dragons have been treated and will continue to be treated for the worms, so that problem should be resolved soon at the least."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,cdca,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:29:28 2015 UTC,"Panacure is a god send (Panacur maybe)  If you need a Rx see if the vet will give you one for twenty or thirty ml. Couple year shelf life, kills most internals.  Yeah its important to find as much as you can from a seller or see how well they stay in touch shortly after the sale. It could very well be the vendor bought those dragons themselves, and that person could have the problem, lots of things can happen, and it could be unintentional, but it happens.  There's a ball vendor here that now apparently does good work, nice looking animals, but I know so many stories of his past I would never buy and never recommend him. So the odd mistake you might not know of, but if someone's done this before or habitually, it usually comes out.  Glad to hear you got it sorted! These guys are tanks so hope they bounce back!"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,jsorrel1,4,Wed Jun 24 12:39:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they might be housed together? Cohabitation is not a good idea for beardies. One will become the dominant beardie. It will hog all of the light and the food and there will be a noticeable difference in size of the beardies.   Also, I just want to give you a quick heads up on your substrate as well, because if I don't someone else will. Sand, crushed walnut, and other loose substrates are viewed as bad for beardies. Your beardies can ingest the substrate and become impacted. Most around here would suggest getting ceramic tile, or at the very least just using paper towels instead of anything loose.  Lastly, you should take a look at the comprehensive care guide in the side bar when you get a chance. It goes more in-depth on the things I have already told you about, plus it has a ton of other great information for taking care of your beardies.  Hope the little guy starts doing better!"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,merlyn923,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback. We didn't hear anything about problems with cohabitation from either the breeder or the vet. Same with the sand substrate (which is marketed specifically for dragons, it's not kiddy sand or anything).  We'll try to separate them, get a second UVB lamp running, replace the sand with tiles/rocks and see if we can't improve the situation that way.  I didn't get the impression that one is really dominating the other in any way - I often see him basking while resting on her back, and she allows this."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,6,Tue Jun 23 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"That ""resting on the back"" is a form of domination.  It looks cute to us, but he is literally stealing her heat and UVB.  You should definitely separate them."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,merlyn923,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Co-habitation shouldn't be in issue for babies though,right?"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,6,Tue Jun 23 13:33:46 2015 UTC,"Cohabitation can be an issue for all. Young beardies will still show dominance over light and food. Also, there can be some nipping going on where beardies can lose toes and tails. Overall, it is just not a good idea to have beardies of any age living together."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,B0UNDL3SS,6,Tue Jun 23 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"It's just as much an issue with babies.  They don't usually kill each other, but stress can kill beardies, and nips happen quite frequently."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,-2,Tue Jun 23 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"This is opinion more than fact. Nips don't happen quite frequently, if the animals are fed and housed properly than they should be rather rare.  They key is, housed and fed properly, babies cohab'd should be fed at least 3 times a day, and observed during feeding, and you eliminate the majority of bite accidents"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,B0UNDL3SS,8,Tue Jun 23 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"Only to a degree. My very good friend and co-mod worked for one of the most reputable breeders in the country, if not the world. Even there 5-10% of babies had nips, and that doesn't even count the non-damaging bites.  Now you get someone with little to no experience, with cohabbed babies, and not really knowing what to monitor for? It's very likely. And it happens a lot in those situations."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,accreditednobody,0,Tue Jun 23 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yes but there can also be other factors that lead to nips and such, you wouldn't believe how many people don't cycle their uvbs properly, or what feeders could do, I'm in no way trying to toot my own horn, but from Aug-Apr I've had probably close to 400 babies come in and out, and of those I know for a fact only had 2 bites that caused loss of tail/toe and usually animals under 6 inches have at least one clutch mate. I whole heartedly agree in a pet/owner situation there is never an excuse to cohab pets, and most people don't have the ability to feed the animals what equals several hundred dollars a month in feeders, which stems aggression with proper feeding schedules, but it can be done for the first couple months, but it does take time and effort, and shouldn't be a long term arrangement.    But my main issue with this whole thread is still Worms in hatchlings!! Serious red flag!"
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,B0UNDL3SS,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:34:59 2015 UTC,"false. nips happen all of the time. ESPECIALLY if one dragon is larger. my baby was housed at the pet store and has her tail nipped not once, but twice in a short amount of time. it happens extremely frequently."
BeardedDragons,3atp8t,B0UNDL3SS,-2,Wed Jun 24 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"What do you do for a living? It's probably something I don't do. Now if I were to tell you something about your job with absolute certainty, tell you you are wrong, even thou that is how you make a living, what you are trained in, what you do day in and day out, you are wrong because I read somewhere you were, not because I know more. Would you think maybe I shouldn't speak with such authority since you may have better insight?  Nips do not happen 'all the time'. Injuries caused by animal on animal is always a potential, but can be drastically minimized with supervision, not constant, when it matters (IE feeding time).   Animals of difference size? Human error, animals not being fed enough? Human error, animals housed in too small a space? human error, etc and so forth but you get my meaning.  They don't happen all the time, but they can happen, and it takes more action to care for animals properly when they live together.  You had a dragon in a store nipped, twice? More likely due to lack of care, than defined certainty.  in my career so far, for animals I've cared for and raised in house, animals that have been housed at least at one time with at least one other animal, I'd easily guess about 1500 dragons. Of those things I've had Mayne 20-30 nips and bites, of those easy half to three quarters would be more proper to say a lapse on my part was more responsible for the bite than the animals.  TL:dr - car accidents happen extremely often, car accidents happen 'all the time', not everyone has an accident every time they get in a car, and lots can be done to not have an accident."

Some species lay them, while others (like dubia) evert them post-fertilization, then incubate them within their bodies.  When it is time for them to be born, they stick it back out and the babies come off, and then they drop the ootheca.  It's a really neat process!"

Also, he might have gotten a little debris in his eye.  Try to get some sterile saline solution at a drug store and flush his eye out.  You should also try to up the temps - 110F is really what you're aiming for with a baby."
BeardedDragons,3as4pa,merlyn923,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:33:35 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a few inches away and parallel. I'll try the saline thanks. How do I up the temp? The lights only have an on off switch as far as I know.
BeardedDragons,3as4pa,merlyn923,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"I think the parallel light is your problem.  The UVB waves are entering your beardie's eyes at a perpendicular rather than incidental angle.  The UVB light should be as close to directly above your beardie, 6-8 inches away, as possible.  Probably, your best bet is to raise the UVB, lower the basking spot, and getting a higher wattage bulb to increase the temp.  I highly recommend a dimmer switch for the light bulb if you can't find one that hits the temps you want exactly.  For instance, if a 60W bulb gets you to 100F and a 75W bulb gets you to 120F, get the 75W bulb and a dimmer to slightly dim down the light to get you 110F."

I would definitely try leaving him alone for a few days, and then as someone else said, you can try hand feeding him his favorite treat. If and when he starts to get fearful, use that as your cue to leave him be, and try again the next day or the next feeding.  As for actually picking him up, assuming that you're doing everything to make him feel secure, definitely just limit it to the viv for now, beginning with just having him sit on your hand at a height he's comfortable with. Of course you can gradually increase this as he gets more confident.  Best of luck, try not to worry about him. I'm sure he'll come around in time!"

BeardedDragons,3anaz1,Galactic_Danger,10,Sun Jun 21 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. If its not already too late for him get him some pedialyte for dehydration and get some fatty worms into him. Get him to a vet ASAP.  EDIT: Like what is said below, syringe feed some pedialyte and a small amount of food. I should probably be a bit more specific when I post."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,Galactic_Danger,4,Sun Jun 21 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"Oh my god the ""if it's not already too late"" part made me cry.   I've got pedialyte for him. I read that chicken baby food and pedialyte would help as good. Is that true? He spits up the worms I shove in his mouth and he won't eat fruit."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,auryncharm,4,Sun Jun 21 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry didnt mean to scare you.. But he is REALLY thin.. You should try to syringe feed him baby food. UVB should be your priority right now, that should help with the appetite."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,merlyn923,2,Sun Jun 21 22:29:33 2015 UTC,Ok. I have his light turned on right now and he has a clean cage and clean water. Could he have contracted something from that? I'm sorry for so many questions. I'm calling vets but I haven't found one who knows anything about reptiles yet. That's also stressing me out.
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,auryncharm,5,Sun Jun 21 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Do not feed him chicken baby food right away.  If he isn't eating and hasn't been in a while, then starting him on something so high in protein can throw his system into shock.  Start him on some veggie baby food for a few days before introducing protein.  Pedialyte is a must.  Try diluting his baby food a bit with it to the consistency of pea soup.  I would definitely visit a vet with him."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,Galactic_Danger,3,Mon Jun 22 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"A small amount of chicken baby food would probably be beneficial, but just a very small amount.  But yes, protein shock is a very real risk with this malnourished of a dragon."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,squishybloo,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"I was going to dilute the baby food and use a syringe to get it down but thank you so much for telling me about the veggie baby food. I didn't think about that. I will be visiting a vet tomorrow. If I can't find one I'm taking him to an emergency vet out of town. I will update after I take him to the vet. But seriously, thank you for the veggie baby food tip."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,savannahrhayne,2,Mon Jun 22 08:28:38 2015 UTC,How is your baby doing today?  Did you get to bring him to the vet?
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,squishybloo,2,Mon Jun 22 22:18:38 2015 UTC,Dirty cages can cause problems. Also if that is your cage in the picture get that cricket box out and if that is a particle substrate remove it.   Vet wise its dependant on your area so I cant be much help there.
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,squishybloo,2,Sun Jun 21 22:43:11 2015 UTC,That's immediately after I saw him. I was still at my moms. His cage has reptile carpet in it now.
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,Galactic_Danger,3,Sun Jun 21 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Please do not SOAK your beardie in Pedialyte - it's a myth that beardies absorb water through their butts...He will die of dehydration before he 'absorbs' enough that way!  He definitely needs to either drink it or get a subQ from a vet.  Please try to feed the Pedialyte with an oral syringe if you can get any from a local vet, or put it in a dish next to him and splash it around so he sees light reflecting off the liquid and (hopefully) is attracted to it."
BeardedDragons,3anaz1,forfingerwobble,4,Mon Jun 22 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"You can soak him in Pedialite to help hydrate him, but he'll probably need to see a vet. Does he eat? Do you know if he had the proper heat and UVB?"

BeardedDragons,3anrvy,B0UNDL3SS,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:47:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good idea! For whatever reason my baby constantly digs (in any corner that she can find in her tank) some say it's her atadenovirus, so I made her a dig and it was my best decision yet! Flax is a dark color, so it holds heat much like sand! It is a bit messy, but flax is easily vacuumed up :)"

BeardedDragons,3altlc,auryncharm,8,Sun Jun 21 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"Walnut shell is horrible for them.  It is a major impaction risk and with its sharper edges it can really do a lot of harm if ingested.  You really ought to switch them to tile, non adhesive shelf liner, or even paper towel, unless you want a really sick animal and a large vet bill.  Also, cohabitation is really not recommended.  Unless you have a super large enclosure, the space is too confined and one always dominates over the other preventing the other from getting adequate heat, UVB, and food.  Not to mention the fighting risk.    Are you planning on breeding them?  If so, be prepared for the large cost involved.  You need proper incubation, separate tubs to house babies of different like sizes, and lots of money spent on large amounts of live feeders since baby beardies will eat up to 100 live feeders each a day.  I don't want to discourage you from having these beardies, but I do encourage you to read the care guide and nutrition guide in the sidebar for proper care techniques."
BeardedDragons,3altlc,auryncharm,0,Sun Jun 21 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I appreciate the tip, I've been told by everyone I know that has them that it's a good substrate for them. I now now better haha. I'll tell them too. What do you think of reptile carpet? I have some from when Tusken was a baby."
BeardedDragons,3altlc,Galactic_Danger,4,Sun Jun 21 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"Reptile carpet is okay for them.  But honestly, it's a lot more work to keep clean.  Really, tile is the best (slate or slate-style ceramic).  You really only have to buy it once and it'll last you.  It's not expensive and super easy to clean (spray and wipe).  I got my tile from Lowe's (if you're in the US) and it was actually in the clearance section because 2 of the tiles in the box were broken in shipping (don't need them anyway, there's still more than enough for my enclosure) and it was 75% off original price (super cheap)."

BeardedDragons,3amhbc,Burn1nsun,2,Sun Jun 21 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"You'll want a bigger space, a full sized dragon will need a 4'x2'x2' space, and they get full sized pretty quick.   You'll need a Reptisun 10.0 bulb every 6-8 months, a basking bulb on an as needed basis (ie it burns out), depending on how cold it gets at night you'll need a CHE if it gets below 65 degrees. Plus you'll need some sort of live feeder bug (crickets or dubia roaches for example) constantly as well as fresh salad type veg.   i recommend you read Merlyn's care guide in the sidebar, it'll help you know what's needed and how to care for a beardie if you deem yourself able to take care of one"
BeardedDragons,3amhbc,majorkurn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:14:54 2015 UTC,But what if I made a tank which had 2 floors? EDIT: I think that would actually mean that I would need more lights etc
BeardedDragons,3amhbc,majorkurn,2,Sun Jun 21 18:26:34 2015 UTC,it'd also be harder to ensure the heat gradient is proper as well
BeardedDragons,3amhbc,auryncharm,2,Sun Jun 21 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"The minimum tank size you would need would be 30 inches wide x 18 inches deep x 18 inches tall (40 gallon breeder), but larger is better.  You would need a fixture and UVB bulb, a fixture and basking bulb, decor, thermometers, and substrate (tile, reptile carpet, non adhesive shelf liner, or paper towels).  These are necessary items, not sure how much/difficult it would be to obtain these in Estonia..."
BeardedDragons,3amhbc,merlyn923,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"36 inches wide, acutally, is a 40 breeder.  20 gallon tanks are 30 wide, but not that deep."

Its a living creature and it deserves to be treated properly, and if your biology teacher has any sense he'd let you take it home. You sound like your doing a great job, and it's definitely worth a shot to ask. The only concern I have is that the beardie does sound sick. If you do become its owner, I highly suggest a vet visit.."
BeardedDragons,3akve3,B0UNDL3SS,4,Sun Jun 21 10:03:42 2015 UTC,"No, you are definitely not overreacting.  This beardie is being mistreated and deserves a loving home.  I wouldn't worry about offending your teacher.  As a teacher of biology, I would hope that he would realize that what is happening here is wrong.  I hope that he agrees to let you have her.  Again, as previously mentioned, give the care and nutrition guides in the sidebar a read.  It has tons of great information.  And be sure that she gets seen by a vet for a wellness check (I'm guessing she's never been before). Just like every other pet out there, they need an annual wellness visit as well."
BeardedDragons,3akve3,auryncharm,3,Sun Jun 21 12:04:20 2015 UTC,"This is a beardie that badly needs a new home where she isn't mistreated.  Good for you to recognize this and be thinking about what's in the Beardie's best interests.  If that teacher is going to keep animals in his classroom, he needs to not only provide proper quarters for them, but also better supervise his students so that the animals don't get abused."
BeardedDragons,3akve3,redneckrockuhtree,2,Sun Jun 21 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"be less afraid of offending a human than you are of what will happen to the dragon if you don't. Offending them may be the only way Dovah gets the help he needs.  Do realize beardies take a good amount of start up work, and more so if there's health issues. I recommend reading the care guide in the side bar and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before you take on Dovah"
BeardedDragons,3akve3,majorkurn,2,Sun Jun 21 05:16:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for advice :) that insight definitely helps me see how I should put Dovah first
BeardedDragons,3akve3,merlyn923,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:21:50 2015 UTC,"be less afraid of offending a human than you are of what will happen to the dragon if you don't. Offending them may be the only way Dovah gets the help he needs.   This is the most important piece of philosophy in the reptile world IMO.  People get so offended, but the only ones suffering are the animals. Obviously, putting people on the defensive isn't helpful, since they will be oppositionary. I've found being informative and non-aggressive helps to get people in the right mindset, but sometimes people need their egos bashed a little ;).  OP - just be honest about the state of Dovah without blaming your teacher.  I'm sure it isn't intentional, and hopefully he has seen that you have a strong relationship with the animal.  Point out to him the things you've noticed (the nail, broken toes, dejection).  Offer to leave the cage and furniture behind (they were an expense for him or the school, after all) and provide your own set up for her. If you're able to, maybe even offer to purchase her from him/the school if it comes to it."
BeardedDragons,3akve3,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:21:16 2015 UTC,So if the teacher doesnt agree take it to the principle or some other authority figure at the school. Animal abuse should not be tolerated in any way.

He had Silks, Translucents, Leatherbacks, and the Dunners. He was really excited about his next planned translucent breeding cycle.   He had two Dunners left from this clutch. Dax and her sister. Her sister was sleeker, but I liked Dax's fat face... I don't remember him saying she was a dwarf of any kind, but he also said he liked her because she had those bright side stripes. Would being a dwarf mean she's going to be smaller? That could be cool. I'm already in love with her, so it doesn't really matter to me.   (*edit: formatting the address.)"
BeardedDragons,3aiyc8,EpitaphREI,3,Sat Jun 20 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"Dwarfy, in most cases such as these, means a more compact trunk of the body, specifically the chest and abdomen. Shorter neck as well. It's not true dwarfism, but there is not a better word for it. It's a common side-effect of inbreeding - and Dunners are inbred as hell. Just keep an eye on her growth and make sure she does not get a URI. URIs in dwarfy dragons, with the compacted chest cavity, tend to be harder to treat."

Typically very little growth happens between the end of the first year and start of the second. However, it can. There's no really ""definite"" numbers for age. It's really more of a range. Baby is 1-5/6ish months, juvenile is 6-9ish months, subadult is generally anything from 9 or so months on until they finish growth. It's really subjective and not THAT important.

If you dont mind doing some rehab with the dragon, I'd say take him. You have an opportunity to improve his life.  3 things you would want to do:   get a UVB  tube light (reptisun 10.0 is the most commonly recommended) get rid of the sand and put in tile or even just paper towel for a while. Get rid of the water bowl. It just added humidity, which is the opposite of what you want for a dragon. feed him better food. Those look like pellets.

BeardedDragons,3agpwb,Galactic_Danger,3,Sat Jun 20 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"Picked up this enclosure yesterday. Koka was growing out of his 30 gallon breeder pretty fast. I should start off by saying this enclosure is really, really solid. The sheer build quality feels much higher than the Exo Terra 36x18x18. All the glass can be removed and replaced if necessary,and the top screen is all metal. There are a few issues, such as the screen on the back right that can leak heat, and the weight. This thing weighs a ton! Once you build it you wont be moving it with one person. Also, there's no handle on the door, and you HAVE to lock it using the included key to close it.   Still need to do a bunch to it, such as mount a UVB tube and put more furniture in. Still, I can already tell Koka is enjoying the extra space, and has already found his sleeping spots. Bonus picture of Kola at the end there."
BeardedDragons,3agpwb,Saint_The_George,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:49:16 2015 UTC,I have the same terrarium and I love it! Everything is well or even overbuilt (which is awesome) and the fact that I can leave the front open means The George can come out and explore the desk area whenever :)  It also makes feeding and cleaning super easy compared to top down or sliding  edit: it's definitely heavy as shit
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Kat1yn,2,Fri Jun 19 23:16:47 2015 UTC,A mistake I made when I started was I bought a kit w/ a coil UVB. Coil UVBs can cause eye damage to your beardie and overall not good as far as I know. Get a tube UVB. I have had the Reptisun 10.0 tube reccomended to me and I suppose you should get that too.
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,TittyMilkBongWater,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:21:34 2015 UTC,Am I supposed to just have it lay on top of the cage just as a dome light? I really don't want to cut the wire mesh and screw it up..   Thank you for responding so fast. I appreciate it.
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,mykidthinksiamwierd,2,Fri Jun 19 23:25:45 2015 UTC,Mine is mounted inside the cage. I used industrial strength doublesided tape from the hardware store. Laying it on top takes away its effectiveness.
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,chensley,2,Sat Jun 20 10:18:22 2015 UTC,Mount the UVB tube inside the cage. The screen will block out most of the rays and it won't be as effective.
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,TittyMilkBongWater,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I'm not very experienced myself, but I wanted to share my little knowledge that I have with you."
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,OMFGSteve,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:43:59 2015 UTC,I used command hooks in the back for my light. Pretty cheap to buy 3 at the hardware store or wherever. Happy birthday!
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"You probably don't need the ceramic unless it gets below 65 degrees at night. I would switch the UVB when you get the chance, the Reptisun 10 is great. Keeping the UVB ontop of the mesh can block out a fair amount of UVB rays, so mounting the tube inside is recommended.   My concern is for the basking spot and those damn styrofoam walls. The wall is going to get shredded, I have had two of those exo terra tanks with the wall and my beardies love climbing it. But they tear them up so there was always stryofoam bits laying around. Your little one is climbing to bask, so I would try to elevate the rocks so he can get closer to the light without climbing the wall.  EDIT: Also I see the egg carton. If that was for the crickets never do that. Always either have a separate place to feed crickets, or feed him one by one in the tank. Crickets are bastards that will chew on a beardie while they sleep. Never leave them in the tank unattended."
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"I have my crickets in a keeper. I know they eat on the dragon. I have since went outside broke a stick, scrubbed it and put the carton flat down, small basking rock on top and the stick going up towards the heat. I put him on the stick and he hasn't moved since.. (The carton was like that as a hidey  for him until I buy one friday)  Should I take the foam wall out and get something like a normal back ground and like the ladder? It's the same as the hammock  by I thick zoomed? I'm on info overload right now."
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:31:27 2015 UTC,"So the wall isnt a problem UNTIL he starts to tear it apart. Once that starts happening I would replace it. Also scrubbing the stick wont really do the trick, you should bake it to make sure you kill everything in it. Seems like you are doing a good job overall though! Keep it up!"
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"Would it possibly be OK for tonight? And would you know how high and long I would bake the stick?  And is it safe to do in my kitchen oven?  Sorry for so many questions,  just a worried parent."
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Just verified with the care guide ""If you use any furniture from outside,  please be sure to sanitize it. Rocks and other hard materials should be soaked in a 5%   solution of bleach in water, thoroughly rinsed, and then baked in the oven at 250°F for 30 to   45 minutes. Wooden objects should also be baked the same way.""   And I would just remove the stick until you have time to do this."
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,chensley,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:50:57 2015 UTC,I went ahead and removed it due to paranoia. I read it should be baked at 200 for 2-3 hours if it's just a small stick. So I'll do that tomorrow. I really thank you. I cut a small piece of card board off a box for him to use for the night. I just wanna make sure he gets that heat. :/
BeardedDragons,3aggsd,chensley,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"Make sure you consult the care guide on the right side there.

But I think the CPU was DOA, because nothing is working, and my clients are pissed that their computer is 3 weeks late"
BeardedDragons,3acz9k,mere_iguana,2,Fri Jun 19 03:44:47 2015 UTC,"nah, I meant that's what it looks like the beardie is thinking.  haha I wouldn't expect the cables to be done before the mobo.  with lizards u never know!  I love love love it when cm is done right, it makes a huge difference.  Makes me wanna leave the side off and put the tower up on the desk just so I can look at it!   as for the nonworking rig - it should have either LED flash codes or beep codes to tell you if the CPU is dead or faulty... if you dont get beeps or flashes, your problem lies elsewhere, like the PSU or those pain in the ass case headers.  don't use the extender blocks!"
BeardedDragons,3acz9k,mere_iguana,2,Fri Jun 19 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"No beep codes. Or LED flashes. It doesn't matter if there is the cpu, gpu, or ram missing. The speaker is plugged in, but never makes any beeps"
BeardedDragons,3acz9k,Jake2197,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"hm, see in that case, I would be looking at either the power switch itself (maybe try another switch or just jump the pins with a screwdriver to power on) .. if still no joy i'd look at the PSU.  either test it on another (good) mobo or try a different PSU.   after that, I'd have to assume the mobo is faulty or got zapped.    usually if a component is bad/not working/missing  (cpu, gpu, ram) then you'll still get a power up and then power down with some sort of codes.  if nothing happens at all, it's gotta be a bad mobo.   just mah 2 cents anyway.  process of elimination always works for me!"
BeardedDragons,3acz9k,Jake2197,2,Fri Jun 19 05:29:42 2015 UTC,"I have tried known, working parts (PSU, GPU, RAM) and this is the second motherboard (first one was also determined to be DOA). The only constant was the CPU, so tomorrow I am taking it into a local computer shop to test it"
BeardedDragons,3acz9k,Jake2197,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"Yup that sounds about right, then.  if you find out the CPU is fine,  the only place left to turn is maybe the case somehow is contacting the board somewhere, and you need some little rubber pads or something (like possibly while plugging in the 24-pin or inserting RAM if the board flexes and contacts ground, that could kill the board pretty easily) ..  or the power button/led/reset wires or switches could be grounding somewhere.    I'd also triple check those case headers (pled, pw+, etc) and make sure they're hooked up correctly with the new board.  and don't use the little extender block, sometimes they can be mis-labeled or just the wrong part and crossing the wrong header pins.  I hate problems like this.  and you never seem to have any of the proper equipment to test the components...    anyway good luck with it. persistence is key!  start from scratch to be extra sure nothing's fucky!"

BeardedDragons,3ad87j,Jake2197,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:05:28 2015 UTC,"She will move if she is too hot.  She can't burn herself if the bulb is on the other side of the screen.  You should measure the temps where she likes to bask, though - having the probe over on the wall is kinda pointless, since heat dissipated very quickly in a screen top enclosure. The UVB should be on the the same side as the heat lamp, but also should be 6-8 inches above your beardie.  Having it closer and at eye level can cause serious eye injury.    So... with those two in mind, a lower basking spot and moving the UVB should be your priorities.  If the basking spot temps are too low after that, you might need to bump up the bulb wattage, and maybe get a dimmer if you need something in between two bulb sizes.  Also, what size tank is that?"

Based on the pictures, I would say your top priorities are switching from sand to at least paper towel, getting proper heat lights and a proper thermometer, and getting an appropriate ReptiSun 10.0 UVB tube light.  Other changes can be made as you're able.  Obviously, feeding is also important on an ongoing basis."

BeardedDragons,3a8v60,Spaceneedle420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you will take excellent care of her!  Keep us posted, and don't hesitate to ask for help :)"
BeardedDragons,3a8v60,Spaceneedle420,3,Thu Jun 18 05:58:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like someone already linked you the care guide. That's an excellent place to start.  You should remove the red night light, it can disturb their sleep and they do just fine in the dark. You don't need to warm her overnight unless she's in a room that drops below 60.   You can also remove the water. They get most of their water from food and the rest they absorb through their  vents from sitting in the bath. The problem with leaviny water in the viv is it can cause high humidity and lead to respiratory infections.  For the bath, I use a Tupperware tub and warm 2 bottles of drinking water in the microwave for about 90 seconds. You don't want it super hot just nice and warm. A 15 minute bath about twice a week should be plenty. Redneck Tip: I put a cookie rack over the top of his tub so he can't jump out.  For flooring you don't want a sand substrate.  If they eat it it can cause impaction of the intestines. My preferred flooring is tile. It's so easy to clean and helps hold some warmth. I took some tank measurements and picked up a 5 pack of 12x12"" tiles at Lowes for under $10. They'll cut it free. You can also just use newspaper or a reptile carpet.  For feeding, just google bearded dragon feeding chart. My primary vegetable is collard greens, then various fruits and vegetables from the chart that are safe for them from our regular groceries. The preferred bug is Dubia roaches. Some people cant get over the idea of having a cockroach colony, but once you establish a population and get them breeding you never have to buy bugs again. Plus crickets are stinky, noisy, and will bite your beardie. If you decide to go this way PM me and I'll send you a little starter kit from my colony.  Dubiaroaches.com has food and water crystals for your colony. A Tupperware tub, some egg crates, and a heating pad and you'll be ready to go.   For feeding her - once a day with as much as she will eat in 15 min will be plenty. Some days she wont eat at all and that's fine. On days like this I may make a couple of attempts to see if she is hungry or leave some torn up collard greens in case she gets hungry. They're pretty tough critters when it comes to eating. I lost mine for a month when he was brumating and he was fine!  Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. Beardies are easy and funny pets!"

His spirit and molecules are returning to the earth and universe to spend time with the passed on relatives and bearded dragons.  I would reccommend getting a yellow light. The red one you have causes vision problems  for the lizards.  The humidity needs to be low usually the day lamp and sand will help keep it low. Perhaps move the vivarium to a separate space away from the fishtank hunidity?  These little guys are really cool, great low maintenance pets. just try not to only give them bugs they can become like spoiled little kids wanting to eat only treats like worms."

BeardedDragons,3a7guz,Raedonic,6,Wed Jun 17 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"Start with a vegi baby food, like squash. Feed with a syringe, you can get them at almost any pharmacy. If he's really dehydrated you might want to mix it with some plain Pedialyte. After about a week or two depending on age of successful feedings move him to chicken baby food. You want to let his digestive track get use to food again before introducing something high in protein.   Your vet might have Oxbow Carnivore Care or something like it to start feeding after the baby food if he is still having problems with solid food. It's a powdered meal replacement for meat eaters. It worked wonders for my Nom when he was sick.   Also make sure the vet you take him to has a reptile specialist. I think there is a link to a site where you can find one in the side bar."

BeardedDragons,3a7guz,Grizzlee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"Poor baby. :( just to confirm--you know how to set up his viv properly, correct? Like proper lighting, substrate etc. do you have a basic understanding of how to care for a beardie? Just want to make sure. My dragon likes to be misted with water on the tip of his nose, and he licks off the drops to drink. Once when he was very dehydrated, I used plain, sugarless pedialyte and gave it to him via a syringe. Although, my herp vet said the pedialyte doesn't do much more than regular water. The vet also said to make sure they didn't aspirate the water either, as this could cause them to drown. Giving the beardie a warm bath can help wake up beardies and get them in the mood to eat. Bathe him if he is having trouble developing an appetite."
BeardedDragons,3a7guz,Spaceneedle420,2,Thu Jun 18 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, Thanks for your concern :) I've looked after beardies in the past, and have a pair myself.

BeardedDragons,3a7guz,Spaceneedle420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:23:04 2015 UTC,If you look in your pet store locally. You should be able to find an emergency electrolyte and protien powder that you mix into a paste and squirt in their mouth.  Try to find this product it will greatly ease his transition back to good health.  Please don't over feed him now. I am worried he could eat him self to death.

Mine got really fussy about crickets, but what otherwise healthy - I offered her some supers, silks, and horns, and she got right back on the program.  Do you keep weights of your beasty on a regular scale? Make sure he's not back-sl;iding on weight - mine didnt want to eat for nearly a week, but was maintaining, and then decided that it was food time again.  However, if you are getting really nervous, a trip to the vet NEVER hurts!  (Other than your wallet)"
BeardedDragons,3a7y77,Kamades,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:24:53 2015 UTC,"Ok! I will give different foods a try, he will eat a bit but it does seem like he isn't interested in anything after a bite or two. I gave him meal worms once but it made him turn completely off crickets until he realized I wasn't going to give him more worms.  I've learned since then they may not be the best. Are there options for a staple other than crickets? I can't get roaches where I live.  How do you weigh your bearded dragon? He's pretty small so I wouldn't be able to weigh him on my scale or anything."

BeardedDragons,3a4qd5,ARysen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:26:43 2015 UTC,"In my custom built enclosure the person used a heavy duty outdoor type screen with wider holes.  I specifically requested this because I have her UVB on top of her screen and this will allow for better penetration.  It's also much sturdier and thicker than your standard window screen. Before anyone says anything about my UVB placement, I do this on purpose because I had it inside of her enclosure to start with and last year she developed a skin cancer tumor that needed to be surgically removed.  I don't necessarily feel that the bulb was the culprit, but I am giving extra space between her and the bulb to try and minimize the risk of recurrence, like when people get melanoma from too much sun exposure (supplementing with D3 and routine vet follow-ups every few months)."
BeardedDragons,3a4qd5,auryncharm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:55:47 2015 UTC,"Can I ask what kind of UVB bulb you were using when that happened? I'm just wondering because I have the Reptisun 10.0 T5 and I've read posts saying that bulb should be farther away from the ground/basking spot, unlike the T8. Some people have said having it over a screen top is fine since the output is so much stronger. I just read all of that recently and for over a year I've had the T5 mounted inside the tank. I've been worried about UVB overexposure but it's been so hard to find anything consistent to back that up. :/"

What happened with mine is that when she was young she sustained an injury which dislocated part of her tail.  It's healed and doesn't bother her at all.

They should probably do some blood work and check for any respiratory infections as well.  In the meantime, carefully give him some baby food veggies by oral syringe (like what they use to give meds to a baby, you can get one at a pharmacy).  Try dribbling the baby food on his snout and letting him lick it off. Once he starts to readily eating the veggie baby food, then you can begin to add chicken baby food a bit.  But because he hasn't been eating for several weeks, if you do the chicken right away it can put his system into a state of shock because of the higher levels of protein.  Stay with the veggies first for about a week or so, then gradually add in some chicken."

BeardedDragons,39zbsf,boredENT9113,2,Tue Jun 16 00:31:32 2015 UTC,"I would try to allow him to sleep at a slight decline, meaning head end is slightly lower than the rest of his body.  The reason for this being that if beardies aspirate water they can develop a respiratory infection (not always, but rather frequently) because they do not have diaphragms to be able to completely and effectively cough up fluids.  Having him at a slight decline will allow gravity to draw any remaining water from his lungs."
BeardedDragons,39zbsf,auryncharm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, i will do that. Thanks for the reply! Other than that i should just watch him closely? I also just noticed that he is gaping his mouth slightly, and stargazing. From what i read that is just a way for him yo try to clear his lungs of the water, does that sound right?"
BeardedDragons,39zbsf,auryncharm,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:01:47 2015 UTC,"If he's gaping a bit then he's still having a bit of a rough time breathing.  I would keep a close eye on him.  If he starts coughing or making any popping noises when he breathes, or if he continues to gape over the next day or two, then I'd bring him to the vet."
BeardedDragons,39zbsf,auryncharm,3,Tue Jun 16 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to update you. I read some more forums, and i was suggested to hold him at a decline. I did this for about 20-30 seconds  every few minutes. He did not enjoy it, but some water did come out, and actually quite a bit did. After that his beard went from jet black to back to normalgradually. When i first started, after i layed him back down he would breath deeply again like he did when he just got out of the bath. Now he is just fine when i lay him flat and appears to be breathing normally. No more water is coming out, and he seems to be doing ok now. I found a reptile vet in my area just in case, but will be watching him closely for the next few days. I really appreciate your responses."

The only thing I'm noticing is that he is gaping. The thing is,  he is only doing it while basking,  so I think he is just regulating his temperature.  Also,  when he is gaping I put my ear right up to  his mouth and I don't heat any popping or gargling to indicate an issue.  He isn't star gazing either.  I'm really thinking that he is OK and only gaping to regulate his Temps. Also,  I was curious about his breathing,  as that will be a good indicator if something is wrong.  I will link a video of him breathing.  Does the breathing appear to be normal? What are your thoughts?   https://youtu.be/U8ClTyxE65E"

BeardedDragons,39wn0i,curxxx,2,Mon Jun 15 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"You need a bigger tank by the looks of it. You need a gradient of temperature and UVB so they can photo-regulate and thermoregulate. 110 basking all the way down to around 70 on the other end.   The CFL you have can cause eye damage, so I would try to get even a 12"" tube.   Not to mention that I tested the UVB reading of the exact bulb you have, and at recommended distances you'd get more UVB on a cloudy winter day under a tree and umbrella."
BeardedDragons,39wn0i,curxxx,2,Mon Jun 15 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh I really don't know what to do... I have a shitty tank that I can't do anything with, a UVB that is apparently useless... The tank is pretty large too so I don't see how it is too small.. We spent around $230 yesterday bearded dragon included, so I can't just go buy another tank and more lights etc. Why would a tank for bearded dragons and other reptiles come with a UVB that doesn't do anything? I'm worried and confused. Also, his poop looks very dry, shriveled up, like little raisins.. Is he healthy? Will the tank setup keep him alive?"
BeardedDragons,39wn0i,curxxx,2,Mon Jun 15 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he's just dehydrated. How big is the tank? Dimension wise? I said looks; it's very hard to gauge from your photos.   It doesn't do -nothing-  it's just... Poor. And I dunno. I bought the kit myself and had to replace everything but the cage, I learnt the hard way.   Providing you're at least meeting his nutritional needs, his temperature and humidity requirements, as well as environmental needs (a hide for example); your dragon should be fine!

BeardedDragons,39y97f,fleshexe,2,Mon Jun 15 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"I only have input for the bath question here. Mushu hated baths when we got him. We gave him a big enough water dish that he could play in it, left him with that for a couple months, and just recently tried a bath again. Now he seems to love it. I think he was afraid of the water at first and slowly got used to it"
BeardedDragons,39y97f,amoz2k12,2,Mon Jun 15 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"The glass surfing probably has nothing to do with the temperature from the basking bulb.  She stops when it's off because she gets too cold and no longer has the energy to glass surf.  They really need these temps to properly digest their food and keep their immune system up to par.  If you palpate her abdomen, do you feel anything like eggs?  If she's ready to lay, this may induce her to glass surf.  Or, if she has to poop she may do this to get your attention (it sounds funny but mine does this all the time so that I can clean it right away).  It also might be just her trying to get your attention.  She may just want some time out of her enclosure.  Or, if she sees her reflection in the glass, that may cause this too.  But, I truly don't think it's the bulb.  For the calcium issue, try dusting her salad instead.  Or get some liquid calcium that you can dose her with by syringe orally.  Www.beardeddragon.co has a lot of calcium options.    The eye squinting does likely have to do with the UVB bulb.  If you search out the Zilla brand online there are a lot of complaints about eye issues stemming from these-http://www.uvguide.co.uk/phototherapyphosphor.htm, http://www.repticzone.com/forums/BeardedDragonCommunity/messages/2265422.html,https://www.beardeddragon.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=865585.  For the bath issue, try placing a washcloth underneath her to give her some traction.  If they feel like they are sliding everywhere they will be uncomfortable.  This may scare them.  I had to do this for mine.    I would still provide a hide for her.  Mine doesn't always use one (in fact she rarely does), but on occasion of she's stressed she will (like thunderstorms and such).  For the question about keeping them cool, do you have an air conditioner in your home?  Or do you let your home get to dangerously hot temp levels?"
BeardedDragons,39y97f,auryncharm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"I try dusting the salad, but she avoids it too. I didn't know about liquid calcium though I will give that a look. I just tried to buy everything that was on here https://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/newbies-guide-what-to-buy/ I will be sure to replace the bulb ASAP, likely this Friday on my day off. I'll also try your advice with the washcloth. And if you think it's not the heat then I'll keep the heat bulb back on then and try to figure out what else it could be.    I've tried testing for eggs, poop, reflections, etc. Those never ended up being the culprit of her glass surfing so I thought maybe it's just because it's a new environment. The glass surfing finally cut back after a couple a months but then it's just started back up again. Maybe she does just need more attention. I let her out at least once a day but I'll try letting her out more often and see if that helps...    I have a window A/C at home, or I open the windows but I worry about heat because of the nature of tanks and the way they keep stuff in... I guess I'm just overworrying but I wanted to be prepared just in case. I live in Minnesota so I have an emergency winter plan but nothing for summer."
BeardedDragons,39y97f,Saint_The_George,2,Mon Jun 15 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"I was concerned about this (this= the tendency of terrariums to trap and heat air) too, also especially the tendency of aerosolized contaminants to linger (I smoke a LOT of hash oil, so map gas fumes, ketone fumes, actual just marijuana fumes, also poop fumes from pooping obviously) so I put an old 120 mm computer fan hooked up to a hacked apart phone charger for 5V 1A circulation fan in one of the upper corners.  As far as glass surfing my Beardie does this when he is bored, when he's hungry, when he wants to get out and when he wants to poop (he does not like to poop in his terrarium and always tries to go on my desk, he will hold it for the opportunity to make a mess on my keyboard).  I think your temps are low.  If it gets cold The George becomes very lethargic and just lies in the light, but otherwise he is active and alert and will definitely do things (like glass surfing if he is in need of something).  His basking area is only about 7 inches from a 75W incandescent, it gets to 109-112 degrees (I also have a IR thermometer :D), nearby elevated area gets to 100-105 and the floor under the basking light (36 inches away) gets to ~92 degrees (all in Fahrenheit).  The cold side is down as low as ~79-83 degrees even during the day and is where the water dish is.  With this set up I've made a few observations: The George still does a ton of basking.  Directly after eating or being active and when he first wakes up he spends about 10-30 minutes in the ~110 degree region, but will often open his mouth to thermal-regulate.  During the bulk of the day he will bask nearer to his UVB lamp where it is around 98-102, after an hour or so here he will often open his mouth as well.  He is almost completely inactive for the first hour of the day while he gets up to temp in the hot spot (the ambient temps here are in the 70s at night).  He will eat no matter what, even if he is too cold or its too late, so I avoid feeding him until an hour after he wakes up and nothing after 2 hours before lights out.  He eats veggies, but only if I'm not looking, or if I actively feed him.  Also, when he has been basking his skin feels warm, even a little surprisingly so.  After the night he is cool to the touch.  I have complete faith in his ability to find the temperature he needs within the gradient I have provided.  As far as a hide I don't have one, there are places where he could hide but has shown no interest, except once when he was having some relocation stress.  (edit: think about his habitat: SW Australia is fucking HOT ;)"
BeardedDragons,39y97f,Saint_The_George,2,Tue Jun 16 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"ha, I love your beardie's name.    yeah, this thread has made me realize I think my beardie is just bored and wants more time out of tank or with me. when we first got her she had no trouble with the heat lamp until the past couple of months and I thought warmer weather = heat = too hot? and as auryncharm said when I turned the heat off she would stop which ""proved"" my theory, but really she was just getting cold and lethargic. also makes sense that around the 6th month mark she would finally be comfortable enough with me to want to hang out... when I think about it now it seems obvious but I needed a fresh perspective    I don't think I'll need a fan all the time because wiith the lamp on I have perfect temps but I'll keep that in mind in case it starts getting too hot, I bet I can find an old fan easy."
BeardedDragons,39y97f,auryncharm,2,Tue Jun 16 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"Hehe, thanks :)  Yea the fan and water circulation pump are really more for my own peace of mind than anything else, I just happened to have them kicking around and figured wth  It did take me a while to figure out glass surfing behaviors though, but just like a baby, just respond with different stimuli and watch the reaction, and you'll start to recognize what they want. (e.g. The George bobs his head against the glass when he wants to come out but if he's just bored he'll slide his chest back and forth haha)"

It really depends on the distance to the basking spot, type of fixture (some reflect light better), type of material for basking spot (i.e. dark stone will get hotter than light colors), etc. Its too hard to say, but I'd keep with your 100W bulb at first and then test his basking spot temp. You can then buy a higher or lesser wattage bulb to accommodate."

BeardedDragons,39yyti,sgntpepper03,6,Tue Jun 16 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"I understand that, poison, and venom are two totally different things. Poison is absorbed, when an animal is poisonous, it causes harm when it gets eaten. For example puffer fish, monarch butterflies, poison dart frogs, ect. Im not aware of any posionous spiders. Venom is a toxin that is injected. Snakes, wasps, and spiders are venomous. Venom is comprised of different protiens and amino acids, and it is actually safe to injest most, if not all, types of venom. That is, of course, if you don't have an open wound in your mouth or stomach.... and could get past the taste.  Point being, if somthing has any spiders in their natural diet, its probably safe for them to eat most spiders. Of course, this has nothing to do with the dangers of getting bit by a spider, but as you can see in the video, there was little to no chance of that happening."

(If your interested http://www.extension.umn.edu/b-assets/efans/ygnews/2013/06/19/Hellgrammite%20-%20andrew%20williams.jpg http://www.sqdog.com/forums/uploads/monthly_07_2010/post-3191-1277950426_thumb.jpg http://www.whatsthatbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/eastern_dobsonfly_male_july_10_2008_a_030.jpg  In order, larva, female, male)  Anywho, helgramites are very sensitive  to environmental changes. Because of that, the presence of helgramites are a reliable indicator for a healthy, toxin free ecosystem. If there was any pesticides or anything in the environment,  helgrimites wouldn't be able to survive there."

BeardedDragons,39wr6d,PoopyTwat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"Just a thin plastic one from the pet store, I did have second thoughts about leaving them in it and going to bed, but they've never escaped before so I didn't think today would be any different. 24~ worms say otherwise though :p"
BeardedDragons,39wr6d,Eclypz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:05:12 2015 UTC,I put my supers in a long drawer-like plastic container with oatmeal bedding and throw in carrots and after they go through them I give them some more. It sounds like they were just hungry and were trying to find food. Maybe.
BeardedDragons,39wr6d,Eclypz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:36:07 2015 UTC,It would make sense - I hadn't fed them at that point. He's not eating them anyway lol. Ugh. Waste of worms lol. I've put them in my cricket container for now (Only option) so chances are they'll have a nice snack before I blend them into liquid :p
BeardedDragons,39wr6d,auryncharm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:41:20 2015 UTC,Does he normally eat them or was this a first time trying them out? I mix them in sometimes with Zeus' greens and he likes that. Did that with Wax Worms this morning and he ate a few right off the bat.

BeardedDragons,39wsss,TittyMilkBongWater,5,Mon Jun 15 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"They don't need night lights unless the room dips below 65 degrees F at night. Make sure you NEVER leave crickets in the cage, especially overnight. Crickets are nasty bugs that will chew on a beardie while it sleeps. As for the handfeeding, that comes in time.   EDIT: I saw no mention of UVB in the enclosure. If you do not have a UVB light in there the beardie WILL die. Get a UVB 10 ASAP, as in today. Do not let that wait."

He just WOULD NOT eat.   I bought this exact tube light and like the next day my little Tigrex was gobbling up crickets like no one's business. Just make sure to get light fixture and something to mount it to the side of his viv. And take off whatever cover there might be over the light.   He still won't let me tong feed him. He likes to chase after the crickets. And once he starts eating pretty regularly, get some vitamins to dust the crickets."

I only ask cause there's quite a bit that u have to kno about beardies.  That being said I'm glad that u want to learn how to take care of it properly but u prob should've read up on it first.  I would refer to the sidebar, all the info u need will be there.  Again not trying to discourage or hate just want the little feller to stay healthy!  Enjoy ur new friend!"
BeardedDragons,39wsss,squishybloo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"You should never keep a red night light on.  It disturbs a beardie's sleep cycle.  If the ambient temperature drops below 65F, a ceramic heat emitter should be used instead."
BeardedDragons,39wsss,odubs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:52:27 2015 UTC,This page really helped me when I was starting out. Covers just about everything you need to know and in my opinion is very accurate. http://www.thebeardeddragon.org/bearded-dragon-care.php
BeardedDragons,39wsss,Peggaret,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"You only need two lights. One to create a warm basking spot. The surface temperature of the basking spot should be 100-105degF. You can check this temp with an IR thermometer which you can pick up from amazon for ~$15. The other bulb you need is a fluorescent UVB 10.0 bulb. It is not recommended to get a compact, mini, or coil UVB light. Beardies absolutely must have this in order to metabolize calcium. If they don't, they will leech calcium from their bones, develop metabolic bone disease (MBD go google it), and can die from this if untreated. You do NOT need the red lamp. It will mess with their sleep cycles. All lights out for bedtime. Those two bulbs should be on 12-14 hours a day. I recommend putting them on a timed outlet, it makes life easier.  Diet: Babies will eat mostly bugs and transition to mostly veggies as they become adults. Before you feed him crickets feed greens (mustard, collard, turnip greens) to the crickets. Your beardie can get veggie nutrients from there. If you can get him to eat veggies all the better! cut pieces smaller than the distance between his eyes. I'd also recommend a calcium/vitamin D supplement to dust on his food at least while he's a growing boy.  There's a ton more detail in this document. But what's written above should get you started in the meantime until you can read it all. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4-LK25H4wfvMFJTVXJZaUExT3M/edit?pli=1  Good luck, they're fantastic pets and develop such unique and weird personalities. Feel free to message me if you have more questions :)"

BeardedDragons,39vsao,fyreweasel,4,Mon Jun 15 06:38:52 2015 UTC,They will grow at different rates. Keep similar sizes together. It will stop some of the nips and nubs also lots of climbing stuff. It will help obstruct their view of each other and help stop bites from bullying. I keep max five to a tub and feed five times a day. Almost never lost a toe or a tail end.
BeardedDragons,39vsao,fyreweasel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:12:11 2015 UTC,"does each tub require its own lights, heat lamp, uv light?"
BeardedDragons,39vsao,merlyn923,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:52:02 2015 UTC,I use a 48 inch uv reptisun 10.0 high output fluorescent tube attached across the middle of three tubs  and a 65 w flood bulb for each tub towards the front for good heat differential. I use 16inch w. 12Inch tall. 2Foot length tubs. 100-105 at front 85-90 at rear.

BeardedDragons,39vcj6,Doritos_Man,2,Mon Jun 15 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"you should be checking the temps right under the basking spot and somewhere on the cool side.  i personally do 7am-9pm  your uvb bulb (unless it's a mercury vapour bulb) should extend about 2/3rds of your tank or so. the light from the monitor depends on where he curls up to sleep, if it's not hitting him directly, it should be okay."

BeardedDragons,39uql1,NugginLastsForever,3,Sun Jun 14 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"Well, they are sun worshippers by nature.  I don't think that you need to worry about them getting too much sun so long as they have a properly shaded area to cool off.  My concern would be preventing them from over heating."
BeardedDragons,39uql1,auryncharm,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"That would be my understanding also.  But have seen a few forum post opinions that say they can get too much sun, but I equate that from heat, not sunlight.  Have read they don't sunburn, and seen people that have full time outdoor enclosures in warmer climates, just wondering if anyone has had experience with babies in say, 6-7 hours of sunlight with shaded areas."
BeardedDragons,39uql1,Saint_The_George,2,Mon Jun 15 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"They are from the SW Australian desert, they are adapted to a shitload of sun and heat and very low humidity.  If your set up is less extreme than spending your whole life in the Australian desert I think you'll be fine."

BeardedDragons,39uesx,H4ZD4M4N,2,Sun Jun 14 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"P.S. Here are some of the usual questions answered:  Temps: About 33 on the hot end and 29 on the cool. Diet: Dubias and mealworms, occasional wax worms, watercress and spring greens. Also something I forgot to mention above, he's been very eager to drink water recently, but won't eat. He gulps water until I stop him. Poo: He hasn't pooped since the mealworms, have tried bathing him a few times and rubbing his belly but he won't."
BeardedDragons,39uesx,Peggaret,2,Sun Jun 14 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"33 is too cool for the warm end. Unless that's the ambient? How and where are you measuring the temps? The surface of his basking spot should be 38-40 degC. This lower temp with the meal worms may have lead to impaction.  When's the last time you changed his UVB bulb? what type of bulb is it exactly? The UVB bulb needs to be changed every 6-9 months. After that they become ineffective and your beardie will not have enough UV to be able to metabolize calcium. Tremors are one if the signs of MBD. The compact and coil bulbs deplete faster than the fluorescent and need to be changed more often.  How old is he? watercress is lacking nutritionally, its mostly water. Try turnip, mustard, or collard greens as a more nutritious staple greens. To deal with the lack of interest in food you can also try baby food since he seems to like drinking. Drip some on his nose so he can lick it off like he would water."

BeardedDragons,39sr3w,NeakosOK,2,Sun Jun 14 14:52:42 2015 UTC,it's the same way people do it with the fake rock walls. though i suggest the insulation foam vs regular styrofoam as it's denser and you get better details/shapes from it than the bubbly styrofoam
BeardedDragons,39sr3w,majorkurn,2,Sun Jun 14 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Styrofoam is perfectly safe as long as you do not burn it.  It will not degrade at 110o F.  Grout is also fine as long as there is no weird bonding agent in it (which would then depend on the particular chemical).  Paint is tricky, you will probably want some kind of non toxic organics based paint as your beardie will consantly be touching/scratching/rubbing on his features as well as eating things off it.  Hope you and your lizard enjoy making stuff!  Generally organic or inert materials are safe, think ceramic, clay, steel, natural fibers etc and think about your beardie's natural habitat, hard packed red clay desert.  PS I have a piece of styrofoam near the basking spot that does get to 110+ with no issues"

BeardedDragons,39rgp6,halosos,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:06:45 2015 UTC,Easiest thing to farm is super worms you just put a good sized rock in there and wait then put the beetles in seperate tanks.  You just have to continuelly buy super worms. Ive bought over 6000 worms and I just now got my breeding and hatching started.  They give you a thosand but sum are real small.  so you farm them pretty much.
BeardedDragons,39q1px,lilchap,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:18:59 2015 UTC,Does he seem to climb all right? It's really hard to tell when they're in pain. He might do better with a completely flat environment. Calcium with D3 powder is a must. Poor little guy. A tube fluorescent UVB light. There's a great care sheet in the sidebar.
BeardedDragons,39q1px,ChitterChitterSqueak,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"He struggles a little bit with climbing, but does alright, he seems to like his hammock and scrambling to the top of his basking rock. I'm coating his crickets with calcium + D3, and a multivitamin once a week, and have the ReptiSun 10.0. I've read the care sheet about three times, it's been SO helpful!"
BeardedDragons,39q1px,ChitterChitterSqueak,2,Sat Jun 13 22:53:12 2015 UTC,"He seems in better shape than a lot of the MBD beardies that come along, especially as crooked as he is. You seem on top of things. The only thing I'd say is watch his climbing closely. If he struggles too much or falls a lot consider ramps or other things to help him get up. He sounds like he enjoys climbing."
BeardedDragons,39q1px,ChitterChitterSqueak,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"He does seem to enjoy scrambling over things. Everything is pretty accessible and close to the ground, so he doesn't have to do too much work. I'm hoping/wondering if he will be able to build up his arm strength with the variety of objects I've put in his cage, I think he may have had a pretty basic setup without many climbing opportunities before I adopted him."

Can you try feeding her some blueberries or blackberries? maybe she isn't getting enough water. The longest I let my guy go without pooping was also in the 3.5-4 week range. At this point I'd suggest coating some apple slices or berries (or another ""treat"") in some olive or vegetable oil for feeding to her, then let her sit under the lamp for ~30 mins, then a warm bath. A trick I've also found is to fill the bath a little higher so he has to swim/wiggle at one end, but can stand at the other end of the tub. The exercise/wiggling seems to get things moving and out.  When you rub her belly in the tub do you feel anything hard? What type of worms are you feeding?"
BeardedDragons,39px8r,Peggaret,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:23:58 2015 UTC,"When I rub her belly I feel a little semi-hard mass but im not sure if it is her organs? When I took her to the vet they said they didn't feel anything unusual so I dont know if im being over worried about her belly. I am feeding her reptiworms, crickets, and dubia roaches. I switch between the three to give her more choices. I haven't tried the vegetable or olive oil to get things moving, I will have to try that. Thanks so much for your suggestions, I really appreciate it!! I will also try the higher water so she will have to wiggle/exercise more. Thanks so much!"

I'm pretty familiar with reptiles but it is my first bearded. I've done a good bit of research and I guess I'm just double checking to be sure. I am open to buying new bulbs or fixtures, when money allows.  Currently it has two, two bulb zoo med fixtures. One fixture has a 75w basking bulb, and a 10.0 UVB bulb. The other fixture has the same 10.0 UVB and a 14w CFL. They are both positioned over a basking area, atop the mesh - reaches about 100 with the AC on, and 115 with it off.  He also gave me a 75w red bulb, but I'm not sure which combo is the best, or if I should have a fixture on the other half of the tank, the cool side. It is not illuminated."
BeardedDragons,39oupf,Ashley_DL87,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:23:21 2015 UTC,"The curly UVB lights stop producing UVB rather quickly, best to use a long fluorescent T8 desert light mounted on the inside of the viv. As for the basking light 75w will be find so as long as it gets the basking spot up to temp. Don't use the red light at all. If you need to provide heat at night look into a ceramic heat emitter. The red light will mess up thier sleep schedule and hurt their eyes. The red light will not cause the pupil to retract and allow to much light to enter- damaging the cornea."

BeardedDragons,39o5k1,Jake2197,2,Sat Jun 13 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Well the environment may be partly the issue.  Their temperature gradient is very important and much harder to maintain in a smaller enclosure.  I know Petco periodically does a dollar per gallon sale.  Also, Craigs list is a good place to look for a used one.  Oh, www.beardeddragon.org has a for sale section which may have some second hand supplies you may like.  It's worth checkin out.  I would remove the under tank heater.  With a tank that size, an appropriate basking bulb should be enough.  She may be too warm along with some relocation stress.  Those dial thermometers are terribly inaccurate.  They are influenced by outside air temps.  I would get an infrared temp gun.  You can find one pretty cheap on Amazon for around $20.  The temp requirements are slightly different for baby/juvie beardies than they are for adults.  The kale is also not recommended as a staple green.  Please give the care guide in the sidebar and nutrition guide, also in the sidebar, a read.  There is a ton of useful info.  Please don't think that I'm trying to nitpick on you.  I made a lot of mistakes when I first got my beardie as well (I'm sure a lot of us here can say the same)."

My vet told me they do have a harder shell that can be very difficult to digest. I know every beardie is different so it may just be my dragons have a hard time with these feeders.  If you look at the side bar Useful Links and the Nutrition Content Link they recommend these as an occasional feed.

BeardedDragons,39maar,Lobos42,2,Sat Jun 13 03:13:56 2015 UTC,If you are talking about dubia then I let mine eat as many as they want. Which atm can total up to 30+ dubias each (depending on size). If you are talking about superworms I fed my adult 18 and it impacted him one day. But it hadnt impacted him before that. So I guess it just totally depends on what else they are/arent eating. I would just take it slow and be very mindful to make sure they dont get impacted is all. Just be careful is all! I wouldnt want anything to happen to your bearded friend.  As you can see below some people do it and dont have a problem with it. I have had several problems feeding 2 different bearded dragons supers as a staple.

BeardedDragons,39ltl5,Galactic_Danger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"A steady diet of superworms might be the problem. They're not really nutritious and they're super fatty. I'd recommend Dubias or crickets.   Edit: Not to make you panic or anything, but Kerrigan looks like she has a hump on her back. It might be the angle of the camera. If not, take her to a vet - that might be beginnings of MBD. But again, might just be camera angle."
BeardedDragons,39ltl5,Baffledil,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:41:42 2015 UTC,Worms are really fatty and can create loose stool. Throw some crickets into her diet in place of a few superworms and it will clear up.

It takes about 4 months for a roach to reach sexual maturity so if you start with babies it is obviously a much longer wait. I started with 15 females and 10 males, along with of 30 juvies. I kept the juvies separate until I knew babies were being produced."

I just provided some veggies and heat, and they thrived! It's only been about a month or so and I already got my first yield! that website pretty much has everything you need to know about breeding! Just try not to let any pregnant momies escape or you'll have a bit of a problem :p"
BeardedDragons,39j8id,Chipinators,3,Fri Jun 12 02:39:46 2015 UTC,I'm on pretty much the same schedule as you.   Put your lights on a timer so you don't need to worry about them. have breakfast ready the night before so you can feed before you leave for work. give a bath and dinner once you're back home.    I got my beardie when she was probably 6-8 weeks and now at 6 months she's been doing just fine.
BeardedDragons,39j8id,fiziks07,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"I leave my house at around 6:30 every morning, and I have a baby as well. I think hes around 3 months old. I premake my salad on sundays and wednesday evenings (to keep it fresh) so all I have to do is dust it and put it in his cage. I put a bowl of dubias in there as well before I leave. I judge the numbers based on how many he has been eating and keep it to similar numbers. (I've been keeping a spreadsheet since the day I got him).   Of course when I get home I feed him again, get him out when its not gonna mess with his digestion time, and bath him do all the rest of the stuff then as well. I have not had any issues what so ever with my little bearded buddy. I think you'll be fine, besides it gets easier as they get older since you dont have to feed them protein twice daily.  Good luck on your decision!"
BeardedDragons,39j8id,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:09:15 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear then. What kind of bowl would you recommend using for the dubias? A small glass one? Thank you for your help, definitely going to pick my baby back up!"
BeardedDragons,39j8id,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just bought a deep dish reptile bowl at my local petstore. Its about an inch or so deep and my beardie sits high enough on his log that he can see into the bowl when I place it in his cage. So when hes ready he just runs down and jumps in. He has no problems getting in and out even at first, when he was much smaller.  The only 'issue' (if you can call it that) is putting 15-20 1/4-1/2"" dubias in there they tend to crawl on my dragon so he flicks them off and sends them flying through his cage. I think its just a nuisance to him I couldnt find any where that was a major issue. Even when I put them in there one at a time they crawl on him if hes not paying enough attention. It freaked me out at first because I didnt want to stress him out over it, but I wanted to have a full disclosure of what I have experienced so far. And i am by NO means a professional, just love my beardie!"
BeardedDragons,39j8id,Peggaret,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:06:11 2015 UTC,"Not a problem at all, one of the best things about beardies is how low maintenance they are once you get them set up.   Get a timed outlet so the lights are taken care of  Leave just his greens and veggies in the morning or leave some sort of feeder that won't climb out of a dish or be a problem if left for a while. I love using reptiworms they're soft and wiggle, are high in calcium and low in fat, and can't climb the sides of his food dish.   Bathe him and handle him when you get home, still plenty of time in the evening for bonding. Also, I don't remember bathing my guy every day, maybe 2-3 times a week and he was fine."
BeardedDragons,39j8id,merlyn923,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but if your baby dragon had yellow fungus, he isn't very likely to get better.  Unfortunately, yellow fungus is extremely aggressive, and by the time it is visible on the external part of the dragon, it is already pretty advanced.  I'm more concerned that the pet store took him back - I would suggest you do not buy another reptile from that store at any time.  Yellow fungus is so contagious and so deadly to other reptiles that I wouldn't trust another animal in that store.  I think you could care for a beardie with your schedule, but I really suggest looking elsewhere, especially if the little one doesn't make it."
BeardedDragons,39j8id,merlyn923,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:46:37 2015 UTC,He was starting to get better however some of their other beardies also got yellow fungus as well so the manager decided to send them all back to where they got them from. They offered to keep mine and finish treating him but my work schedule ended up being more intense than I originally expected so I declined. Eventually I'll get another one once things quiet down. As for them taking him back it is their pet sales policy so they don't really have a choice. At least I got a full refund on him I guess.
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,Gurnsey_,2,Fri Jun 12 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"i buy my crickets 1,000 at a time for $35 from my local pet store and i keep them in a big aquarium with egg cartons and veg in there. for feeding time, i knock them off the cartons into a margarine tub or so, till they start to run low, then i scoop them out by hand."
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,majorkurn,2,Fri Jun 12 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"How do you keep the cage clean? The cricket pen I have gets filthy with just 50 crickets, and it's hard to clean it without them escaping everywhere."
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,majorkurn,2,Fri Jun 12 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"i clean it when i get more crickets, so when i'm down to my last dozen or two, i scoop them out, put them in one of the feeding tubs with a lid (they have bits of mesh in them), and then take the egg cartons out, and dump the whole thing onto an open pizza box, funnel the crap from the box into garbage bag, and clean the tank normally, dump the extra crickets back in, figure if i have enough for the next day's feeding, if not go get more that day."
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,Lobos42,2,Fri Jun 12 00:44:51 2015 UTC,You buy a dubia colony and never buy crickets again! <3  I have always bought my crickets from georgiacrickets.com They were always good to me and provided fast service.

BeardedDragons,39iqb8,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"You can get small enough dubias to feed right away.  Insanely cheaper, no smell, no mess.    $30 for 1000 1/8th-1/4th inch for babies, or $28 for 1000 1/4th - 3/8th inch for juveniles.   Get some large ones or adults at the same time, and get your colony started early while feeding the smaller ones off."
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,Lobos42,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yep exactly this! My baby is about ~3 months old and i've been feeding him those from the day I got him at 8 weeks or so old. I got way tired of the expensive cricket purchases being shipped, the stench , and they just arent as nutritious as a dubia. Crickets arent as easy to keep alive or to breed IMHO. My breeder bin gets a heating mat, food and water and let them just do what they do.  My feeding bin is the babies that are ~1/2 or smaller that i just feed off. Nothing to keep them super warm (my house is 70 year round) and fresh food/water daily"
BeardedDragons,39iqb8,Dravorak,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"I also wanted to add, I had that cricket keeper thing and couldnt figure out why I had so many crickets running around my house. Turns out they easily escape by running up the tube and then through the hole. Of course this was for the smaller sizes 'pinheads' and the size slightly bigger than that if I recall correctly. So I had to immediately switch to a small glass aquarium (20 gal or so) and put them in there... no more escapees. Just a warning :)"

There's a blood vessel in there called a quick that you need to be careful and not cut into. Also, wait until after his lights go out to clip his nails. When he's cold and sleepy he can't pull his foot away or squirm. Makes it much easier to manipulate his little toes to a good position for clipping :)"
BeardedDragons,39ciab,Peggaret,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:52:00 2015 UTC,Nice tip! Wish I had thought of that yesterday lol
BeardedDragons,39ciab,curxxx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:35:12 2015 UTC,I'd suggest looking for youtube vids as there are veins in the toes and the beardie will get upset if you cut into them (I know first hand as I had to do it to fix mal's toe.) You can use normal human nail clippers though. If you get rough textured tile then it'll help passively trim them. :)
BeardedDragons,39ciab,majorkurn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:17:52 2015 UTC,"I wait till their lights go out and they're ready all sloppy and ready to fall asleep.

BeardedDragons,39dy92,Fetusbong,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to finally show my new beardie off on this form, but been preoccupied.. I ended up cutting out a piece of 1/4"" ply wood and cut my tiles to fit. I put industrial strips of double sided tape to hold the tiles down to the plywood. Also used a sealant grout in between the tiles to make sure no poop/dirt/food gets in the cracks. I left about 1cm of space on all four sides so that I can take out the floor to scrub it down once a week-ish. Also tile makes daily spot cleaning insanely easier! Tile is the best. Just heavy/awkward to take out of the tank sometimes.  Make sure to get rough textured tile to make sure they got grip and it helps with their nails.  Within the week I'll be posting pictures of my whole setup and my cutie beardie."

Also, what veggies are you feeding her? My beardie gets all his water from fruits and veggies so she may not be getting enough water. Maybe start feeding the crickets veggies right before feeding her? Its called ""gut loading"" and she can get the nutrients by eating the crickets. Ideally, she would be eating the veggies herself, but its a good temporary fix. If she still isn't pooping, try coating apple slices with a bit of olive or vegetable oil. When my guy hasn't pooped in a while I do this and he poops within half an hour or so."

I have cricket food that is this blue gel stuff that the pet store said should give the crickets water and nutrients before she eats them. I tried the bath, but I will try again.

I keep the basking temp for my Laredo around 100o F (about 38C) with plenty of spaces for her to cool off if she wants. Don't feed beardies any type of lettuce - it's mostly water with few nutrients. Try turnip, collard, or mustard greens instead, as well as cilantro (my beardie loves mustard greens and cilantro, which I do, too, so what I don't eat gets chopped up for her and if I buy too much for her, I can always get in it too lol).   Yellow squash I think is alright, as are carrots. Apples I'm pretty sure should be a treat (for similar reasons as the substrate) and have no idea about strawberries & watermelon - check the sidebar for a comprehensive nutrition sheet.  If your beardie is becoming picky, just back off on feeding her crickets and continue to offer fresh greens. Think of it like raising a child: your lil' one won't eat their veggies if they know they can get junk food later (crickets).  When giving your beardie a bath, make sure it's about body-temp warm (again, aroud 100o) and no deeper than the top of their shoulders. Make sure the lizard can get out if it gets too warm and be sure to keep an eye on it. If your beardie's like mine, it'll use bath time as an opportunity to drink as well (they can't ""see"" water, and will only react if they notice its movement).  Hope this helps!"
BeardedDragons,39d1pd,lolwatzki,3,Thu Jun 11 15:42:54 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I have all of the reading materials on the sidebar now. (I didn't even think of that being on mobile)!

BeardedDragons,3987e6,HastaLaMuerte,3,Tue Jun 9 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"Try to see if the temps are consistently more towards 90 rather than 113, that might be the problem. If her temps are to low she won't digest food as well which could lead to impaction. Make sure she stays hydrated too."
BeardedDragons,3987e6,rizzdizzle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:09:18 2015 UTC,I will definitely keep an eye on her temps. I just checked them and they are hovering around 106F.
BeardedDragons,3987e6,rizzdizzle,3,Wed Jun 10 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"If she'll eat roaches most people say they're superior to other bugs as far as nutrients and digestion. You could try getting horn worms too, they have a lot of moisture to them, and usually beardies go crazy for them, but aren't typically a staple. I can't remember if that's just cost or if they aren't a good staple for nutrients."
BeardedDragons,3987e6,Lobos42,2,Wed Jun 10 03:45:23 2015 UTC,My dragons have always had trouble with superworms. I have had to go to emergency vets twice because of the impactions.

BeardedDragons,398etd,redneckrockuhtree,2,Wed Jun 10 00:20:42 2015 UTC,How many did you start with? It looks like you are doing well!
BeardedDragons,398etd,Lobos42,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"I started with 100 0.75"" nymphs and around 8 adults.  I fed Dovah maybe 10 - 15 of the juveniles and one of the adult males.  A few weeks later, I added another 100 nymphs and more adult females.  That was about three weeks ago.  I've since fed a few more, but not many.  Right now, I'm letting them colony get well established and am letting the initial group mature a bit.  I'll thin the males out initially, then feed off some of the bigger nymphs -- I'm hoping to be able to start doing that in a couple weeks.  Last night, I wanted to see how they're all growing as well as see what kind of die-off I've had.  I'd estimate I've had at most 10 of them die, and they're all growing quite nicely. The diversity in sizes tells me odds are good the females have had a few broods, especially since some of the ones I found were under 1/4""."

I'm so glad these are easier to deal with than roaches"

While it's apparently true that UVB bulbs have been fixed by the major producers (ZooMed etc - DON'T TRUST OFFBRAND!) of them, they're still inferior to tube lights for technical reasons like UVB spread, as well as the fact that they lose their effectiveness every 3 months rather than every 6 months like regular UVB tubes.  I would still get a tube."

BeardedDragons,396vbs,squishybloo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"OH!  Hmmmm..    It's difficult to say.  Like I said, the UVB spread of compact flourescents isn't so hot - that means that you need to put the light a lot closer to the animal to get the same effectiveness.  And at that distance, the risk of damage to their eyes is very much increased because the light is so bright.  Here's a decent site that goes over some details if you want to peruse it - it DOES say that the cases have significantly decreased, with case histories and all of that junk.    I'd basically take his word into consideration and read up on it yourself, then decide.  You might just want to put another tube setup in.."

BeardedDragons,396vbs,squishybloo,0,Tue Jun 9 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"Read mentions about bathing beardies - it's everywhere!  People think they absorb water through their cloaca and that that's why you give them baths to rehydrate them.    I mean let's think realistically here - beardies come from, basically, a desert.  ALL reptiles have very water-resistant skin, why do you think alligator skin used to be so popular?  And that's from a water-going reptile!  Being able to take in water from a vent means that water would pass both ways, and they'd lose water badly as well; a very poor adaptive trait.  Sitting a beardie in water and expecting the cloaca to absorb water is like us being badly hung over and dehydrated and sitting in a bathtub to rehydrate and feel better.  It's a laughably silly concept.  Thirsty beardies drink, just like us.  And it helps them poop!  That's why we bathe them. :)  Edit:  LOL, annnnd I get downvoted for speaking the truth.  See?

I'm sure any change from the norm could potentially upset your beardie.  He could also just be a picky brat haha. Nom has done that a few times.

They get bigger everyday and will get a bigger appetite in the process, which means you will have to buy a lot of food if you aren't breeding roaches yourself. Try cutting down to 6 or 8 eggs. Looking after a lot of babies can really tie you down. Shriveling usually never happens to fertile eggs, they just get dimples/dents when they are drying out normally. Make sure you have a lid on the container and that the container is not directly in front of the fan."

They must be really tasty.  o_O     Its frustrating, because superworms are a good feeder IN COMBINATION with other stuff.  And they're super-convenient to keep.     The only thing I've found to work is to really try to shake their diet up - handfeed different fruits and veggies, and do NOT give them any more superworms for awhile.  Feed other live food.     Sometimes, if I've ordered a lot of superworms, I just make sure that they're gut-loaded with calcium-rich veggies and simply cave and let the dragons have their damn superworms.  throws arms up in frustration     Then, once my batch of superworms runs out, then I bust out the tough-love."

It depends on the beardie's appetite and whether it's going through a growth spurt or not.  Beardies need the extra protein as they grow.  That being said, it also depends upon the size of the crickets being fed.  They should never be feed crickets that are larger than the space between their eyes."

BeardedDragons,38g0w1,auryncharm,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"Her temps are around 90 - 95 during the day and 65-ish at night.   The substrate is just vitamin-enriched premium sand from PetSmart. I'm allergic to the ones with treenut dust. I had a reaction at school when we put it in. Didn't know it had treenut dust in it.   Her diet is about 10 crickets per day and some of this in a little dish.   I'm not quite sure if she has a UVB bulb. I probably sound dumb but all I know is that I have a bulb for light during the day, a heat lamp for the day, and a purple bulb for the night.   Also, for some off reason, she won't eat veggies. I keep trying to get her to eat kale and red lettuce, but she just wont. She just lets it sit in the tank and fry."
BeardedDragons,38g0w1,auryncharm,3,Thu Jun 4 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"There is a couple of things that will need adjusting.  Sand, of any kind but especially the reptiles calcium sand from the pet store, is a big impaction risk.  If the beardie swallows any of it, it can congeal in the intestines and form a blockage.  It's recommended that they be on no loose substrate of any kind (sand, walnut shell, moss, etc...)  The recommended options are paper towels, reptile carpet, non-adhesive shelf liner, or tile.  For the diet, lettuce is not really recommended because there is no real nutritional value to it (mostly just water).  Better options include collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, turnip greens, arugula, escarole, endive, chicory, clover, and alfalfa greens.  Kale and spinach are not recommended as a staple because of their high oxalate content which binds to calcium and prevents your beardie from absorbing it properly.  My best recommendation would be to review the care guide in the sidebar-https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4-LK25H4wfvMFJTVXJZaUExT3M/edit?pli=1, and the nutrition guide- http://www.beautifuldragons.com/Nutrition.html.  These are very comprehensive and will give you tons of great information.  I do have to stress how important a UVB bulb is to a beardie's health though.  If she doesn't have one she really needs a tube style Reptisun 10.0 bulb that covers st least 2/3 of the enclosure.  This bulb should be replaced every six months regardless of whether it lights up still or not.  The UVB output diminishes over time.  Without this she will develop metabolic bone disease.  If she's not eating well but looks to have suddenly gained weight, I would have her seen by a vet to rule out any underlying health issues."
BeardedDragons,38g0w1,Peggaret,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:49:43 2015 UTC,"First off this is a horrible assignment, which is not a reflection on you, but is incredibly irresponsible of your teacher. Mind if I ask if this is a high school project? or is this a college class? What happens to the animal when you're done with the project? Bearded dragons live 10-12 years in captivity, just so you know. Also, beardies do require a complicated initial set up, and it sounds like you just grabbed something like a reptile starter kit at Petco which isn't going to be a good habitat for your bearded dragon. I'll try to walk you through some basics here, but from what you're saying, pretty much everything has been incorrectly set up. Not your fault, the big pet stores don't have a good support and knowledge for reptiles. How long is your beardie, nose to tail tip? What are the dimensions of your aquarium?  First off, the bulbs. Beardies need two. One should provide heat and light for a basking spot. The surface temperature of this basking spot should be 100-105 degF. If its not warm enough you can either get a higher watt bulb, or raise her basking spot higher until its warm enough. You can check this temp with an infrared thermometer which you can pick up on amazon for <$20. The second bulb should be a ReptiSun 10.0 UVB fluorescent bulb It will look like a long tube. Do not get the 5.0, or a coil bulb and do not get the mini-fluorescent one. Bearded dragons must have the UVB bulb in order to metabolize calcium. If you are missing this, they will leech calcium from their bones, the bones will become soft and if not treated, she will die. (search metabolic bone disease for more info) The heat lamp and UVB should be on 12-14 hours a day. I have mine on a timed outlet so they turn on and off automatically. Throw away that purple bulb, its useless.  Next, substrate. Get rid of the sand. They can ingest it and it will literally clog their digestive track. This is called impaction and it can also be fatal. (They can also get impacted if their basking spot isn't warm enough and can't digest their food.) Plain glass is better than sand. I would recommend tile since its easy to clean, but there's also reptile carpet and paper that are acceptable.  Diet: When they're young they don't eat many vegetables. Your staples should be greens that are very nutritious. Mustard greens, turnip greens and collard greens are easy to find and good for beardies. Lettuce is nutritionally useless, and those dry pellets can be used in a pinch, but are not ideal. You can also feed the greens to the crickets before feeding them to her. Put some leaves in with them about 20 mins before feeding to the beardie. Also, try a variety of other fruits and veggies. Bell peppers, squashes, apples, blueberries, and peaches are some favorites of my beardie. The rule of thumb is to slice fruits and veggies up so they are smaller than the gap between her eyes.  If your beardie is in fact a female, she will need a calcium supplement to make up for all the calcium she loses making eggs. Rep-Cal calcium powder with D3 is fine and you can buy a tub for <$10 on amazon. She will also need a dig box when it comes time to lay eggs. I've only had males, so I've never had experience setting these up, try checking the FAQ or posting for help on set-up  For the constipation, try giving her some warm baths. Beardies tend to poop in warm water. If that's still not working, get some slices of apple and coat with a little olive or vegetable oil. That can help loosen things up inside.  Sorry, this is a lot of information and I don't think any of this is your fault. Irresponsible pet ownership is a huge problem when it comes to reptiles. A lot of people don't realize how much care they need and don't do their research. We end up with dead beardies whose owners never realized they were doing something wrong, its very heartbreaking for us and the pet owner. Just watch some videos of beardie rescues on youtube. A lot of them have MBD and crooked limbs due to improper care and nutrition, its very sad to watch :(  Please don't hesitate to ask more questions, I'd love to help you out and make sure your little gal is taken care of."

BeardedDragons,38h4f7,Quixeh,3,Thu Jun 4 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"I've moaned about this before in this sub but I'll say it again; UVB metrics are essentially meaningless unless you really understand the physics and so did the person who measured the bulb.   Depending on the type of bulb, e.g. D3, D3+ etc determines what spectrum of light they emit. Here is a typical range of reptile bulb spectra: http://www.uvguide.co.uk/images/phototherapyphosphor/UVAcombospectrawithD3andDNA-AS.gif    What is important here? Its the amount of each graph that overlaps the black D3 action spectra; the area in which the light can be used to create vitamin D3. Anything outside of that area probably isnt doing much, but thats how the phosphor works. Notice how some still have output over 400nm? That's why we see some light from their UVBs, but its a tiny fraction in comparison to how much UV they output.  Now, notice the units are spectral irradiance, that's uW/cm2/nm - its the power per unit area at any given wavelength. A brighter bulb of the same type will show the same curve, just higher up.  So how do you compare that to a unit of uW/cm2? You take the area of the curve. Here is the problem! Two very different bulbs can have very different spectra and 'brightnesses' but still have similar areas under this curve. Furthermore, if you use a measuring device it has it own response curve; two slightly different devices will measure different uW/cm2 even when calibrated correctly.  Another problem: the inverse square law. Imagine looking at a candle in the night. It spreads its light over a sphere; if you double your distance from it, the power reaching your eye falls to 1/4.   What does all this mean for our beardies? Well: * The closer they are, the more UV they get. But - don't let them touch it, its hot. * Don't listen to units of uW/cm2. * Stick with a known brand and bulb design. Read the manual and place it at the recommend distance. * Phosphors degrade and change the bulb. They are consumables, and whilst I somewhat doubt the need to replace quite as often as the manufacturer wants, they do need to be replaced regularly. * Remember what you're trying to do: replicate the sun (see:  http://www.uvguide.co.uk/images/phototherapyphosphor/solarspectrawithD3andDNA-AS.gif ) Too much UVB, or the wrong kind, is harmful. There was a case where people were using UVB phototherapy bulbs (with spectra like these: http://www.uvguide.co.uk/images/phototherapyphosphor/UVBcombospectrawithD3andDNA-AS.gif ) which are designed to emit at slightly lower wavelengths, closer to the DNA damage action area, thus having a higher biological effect and hurting their reptiles.  At the end of the day, there is no easy answer, even when you think you understand the photometry. Personally, I plumped for my local reptile centres advice which is borne from experience."

BeardedDragons,38fyyr,Fetusbong,2,Sat Jun 6 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"I use wood for her to lay on--climbing sticks as well as a hollowed out log so I don't think it's too hot but I suppose it's possible. She mostly lays on the basking side of the tank, just behind all of her stuff.   I ended up making an appointment with the vet. With the humidity having been so high the past couple of weeks in Washington DC I'm concerned she may have a RI. Even with my dehumidifier her levels have consistently been around 50-70%.

BeardedDragons,38ayoo,ChitterChitterSqueak,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"Beardies aren't sexually dimorphic the way uros can be. For instance, both males and females of beardies can have pronounced femoral pores. However, if you've ever sexed a Uro by holding the tail at 90° and checking for hemipenal bulges then you've got an advantage because sexing beardies is exactly the same.   As to age, we probably would only be able to guess based on size, weight etc, and we'd only be able to say whether they were adult or juvenile. From this photo it's difficult to tell because juvenile/subadult beardies look much like fully grown beardies only slightly smaller."

It is an injectable broad spectrum antibiotic, and it is extremely good at dealing with RIs, even recurring or resistant ones. The newer bacterial strains are now resistant to oral Baytril. I haven't seen Baytril work properly in about 2 years now.  Also, please be sure to give the full course of ANY antibiotic, even after she starts to get better, even if she appears perfectly healthy, ALWAYS give the full course.

He suggested either an xray or antibiotics. I asked what antibiotics he would suggest and he said Fortaz (it's called fortum, but I think it's the same thing? Ceftazidime) injection and some anti inflammatory (Metacam?) to be given orally.  He said do the injections in each alternating back thigh, just inbetween the scales every 3 days, so Thu/Sun/Wed/Sat etc, and the Metacam orally every other day, so Thu/Sat/Mon/Wed etc.  We are going to try the antibiotics route and  I'll be taking her back in at the end of next week for a re-assessment, see if anythings changed/deteriorated.

BeardedDragons,388i5z,SydneyRubbert,2,Tue Jun 2 17:50:09 2015 UTC,"7 months is right about that time to start working on separating them. When they're young like that, they may do OK. But once they start hitting puberty  (very very soon, if not already) things will change.  If they are both males, they will fight to the death and must ALWAYS live separately. No exceptions.   If it's a male and a female, the male will breed his sister (possibly to death) and you definitely don't want any inbreeding.   Two females may sometimes get along, and sometimes not. Being raised together helps, but that means nothing. I know people that have had females live fine together for 4 years, only to find one completely mauled when they got home one day.  It's honestly just not worth the risk, even for females. I have over 100 breeder dragons, and every single one of them has their own home. Even my females. It is so much better for their well-being and quality of life to have their own homes."

BeardedDragons,385pev,OMFGSteve,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"Paarthurnax (from Elderscrolls wikia):       Paarthurnax claims it was Alduin's false claim of godhood that turned him against his older brother.  However, Nordic legend states that it was Kyne herself who intervened, and sent Paarthurnax to assist mankind.  Either way, Paarthurnax, along with several other Dragons, betrayed their former master and taught mankind to use the Thu'um.  Mankind eventually prevailed and Alduin was banished from Mundus. As with all Dragons, the lust for power was innate and still strong within him and if left unchecked, he would surely revert to his old ways. To overcome this, he retired to the peak of the Throat of the World and lived in seclusion so that he could meditate and focus on the Way of the Voice, a pacifist creed developed by Jurgen Windcaller that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits.

His other foot is similar but not as bad. His other one looks worn or burned like? His temps are fine and I feel his rock and tiles and they aren't that hot. Barely even warm. What could this be? I noticed this week ago but I waited for him to shed and now it looks worse. He glass surfs all the time. Is he damaging himself? Infection? Or is it healing? I have a reptisun 10 tube and dust his food with calcium D3.

Boo has the same kind of thing (I know it's not a burn because her basking spot is on her hammock, not wood or stone).  My vet believes that it's from a lot of exercise.

BeardedDragons,382cuz,Eclypz,2,Mon Jun 1 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm just looking over the price of feeding my dragon and it's coming out to like $300 a month. That can't possibly be right, can it?? I don't even spend $300 a month to feed myself! LOL  And I would look into the roaches if I weren't absolutely terrified of roaches. I watched an unboxing of 1000 Dubia Roaches today and couldn't even sit through the entire thing. Crickets don't bother me, though. But they're 13 cents a piece and if my baby beardie is going through up to 100 a day....wow that adds up, doesn't it?"
BeardedDragons,382cuz,Eclypz,2,Mon Jun 1 13:39:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you get over the roach fear in favor of saving money. lol.   A JUVENILE bearded dragon is going to cost you some serious money on feeding while he/she is growing! They will eat eat eat eat and if you don't feed them they're not going to grow as quick or as much as they should. It's very important to feed your baby dragon 2 or even 3 times a day and as much as he/she can eat in 10-15 minutes. You'll pretty much know when he/she is done eating.   Honestly, crickets stink, they don't live long, they cost a lot and they sometimes carry diseases that pass on to your dragon. I know it happens...sometimes even big chains have crickets that get parasites.   I spent a few hundred on my dubia colony but NOW I have tons of them and can feed them off to Zeus and don't have to spend money on his staple feeder. He's slowly eating mostly greens and that's what happens as they get older and go into adulthood (18 months). My dragon is not even a year old yet and he's starting to favor greens more...which is a lot cheaper! (I can now get some greens for $0.99 a bundle and that lasts a week or so!)  Keep a dish in there with greens and maybe try dubia if someone offers them in your area. At first...I could handle the baby nymphs and that was it. I was creeped out by the adult females and ESPECIALLY the males. Now I just grab dubia from my colony and don't care what they are. They don't hurt you/bite and my dragon loves them. I've lost that ""creeped out"" feeling for most bugs now having a dragon. Lol. You can't really be afraid of their feeders! Makes things more difficult. haha  Let me know if you have any questions. I'm here to answer them. I've done a lot of research to make sure my bearded dragon is very well taken care of and that he's getting a good diet, etc.   Also, even with dubia roaches I was spending maybe $80 per month for a few months because he would eat 1,000 roaches every couple of weeks. lol.   Good luck!"
BeardedDragons,382cuz,sinprex,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Is there any possible way I could order the roaches and never, ever have to touch them?? lol I want a beardie so bad but not sure I can fork over $300+ a month for crickets for the next year to have one... so I'm actually considering the roaches. That's how bad I want one. If I were to order 500 of them, about how long would that last me? And how long will they survive?"
BeardedDragons,382cuz,Eclypz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:57:52 2015 UTC,"I used tweezers and a cup when I first got mine. You just pick them up with the tweezers and drop them in the cup, shake them up with your calcium/vitamin powder, and drop them out for your beardie to eat. If your beardie is real small and you dont plan on breading the roaches I wouldnt get that many at a time. A portion of them may grow to big for your dragon in the time it takes to feed them. Honestly though you should start a colony though its stupid easy and you will then have essentially infinite feeders. It will cost you a few hundred to establish, due to having to replenish the colony during the first six months, but now it only costs me like 10 bucks a month in food for the bugs. I used west coast roaches for all my stuff. Feel free to pm if you have any questions."
BeardedDragons,382cuz,auryncharm,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"Dubias live to be 2 years (female) and 1.5 years (male)   You could use tweezers and a cup as suggested by sinprex. You'll need to clean out the bin every couple of months (remove the poop) and feed them. If you just want to keep feeders then it's different than if you want to breed them. If breeding they'll need heat, oranges and of course their other food sources. If feeding they just need food and water. Egg crates for both. Look on YouTube for ""Dubia Colony"" and you'll see tons of care guides and examples of setups."

I've never seen anywhere say that they only last for 2-3 days. If I'm wrong, please correct me. But don't buy crickets at petsmart as they are very expensive."

BeardedDragons,37yyg9,thisismeER,2,Sun May 31 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"If you're set up to afford it now, it's more cost effective in the long run to buy their ""forever home"" right off the bat. Instead of buying two enclosures buy one. There's no harm with a little dragon in a big house. Keep in mind they reach full size in just about a year, which is not that long. A baby will outgrow a 25 gallon by 6-8 months.  There is a wonderful care guide provided in the sidebar, as well as an extensive nutrition guide that are both worth reading over thoroughly.   As far as I know, most people on this subreddit would not recommend that exo-terra enclosure you have picked out. Coil UVB bulbs are not considered healthy for your dragons eyes, and the mesh screen between the light and enclosure space blocks out any UVB waves to begin with. As I mentioned before, a baby will outgrow something that size very very quickly. Also there is a necessary stigma against any loose substrate as it is a huge risk to cause impaction and death/suffering.  Please do your research. You are taking a complex life in to your hands and they have many specialized needs. I don't want to be a downer but I see far too many dragons in unhealthy conditions all the time, but when you put in the little extra effort to make sure they are well taken care of, you will have an amazing friend that will stay with you for many years."

BeardedDragons,37x7p3,Caltsar,3,Sun May 31 03:48:23 2015 UTC,"Several months ago, I started noticing signs of MBD in Errol. I went over his diet and environment to see what I could fix in his husbandry. I got a UV meter and levels were already higher than necessary. His diet included all the right foods as well as dusting roaches and salads with calcium and vitamin supplements. I bought an extra UV light and mounted it inside the cage as well as increased the calcium and vitamin D in his diet. His symptoms continued to get worse.  When I brought him into the vet, I explained what was seeing and was given Calcitonin to inject three times a day for a week. He started showing signs of improvement, so we kept it up. Unfortunately we are not able to figure out an exact cause except that Errol has more trouble absorbing calcium than most other bearded dragons. Now that he is moving normally again, he is getting Calcitonin injections twice a week, and a liquid calcium/Vitamin D suppliment once a day. He is also getting monthly vet checkups to make sure his progress is going well. His xrays never showed decreased bone density. However, his joints were swelling. Last week he started on a liquid NSAID that has been bringing the swelling down considerably. Today he started actively hunting and climbing on his own again!  For those curious, my setup is as follows:   18x18x42"" front opening tank with kraft paper covering tile 24"" Reptisun 10.0 mounted in a fixture outside the tank (with a hole cut in the mesh lid) changed every 6 months Second 24"" Reptisun 10.0 mounted inside the tank after signs of MBD were discovered scheduled to be changed every 6 months Basking spot - 110F Cool side - 85F Night time - 72F Lights on from 7AM to 9PM Feeding Schedule: Every morning, Errol is given a salad of collared greens, dandelion greens (and flowers), carrots (shredded, seems to keep him interested), and kale. Chopped fine. He eats all of it, and is given more for dinner. At dinner time, he is given between 3-5 large juvinal dubia roaches. All food is dusted with calcium daily and calcium with a vitamin suppliment 3 times a week. Baths are given two to three times a week. Tank is cleaned of waste when necessary and washed once a week."
BeardedDragons,37x7p3,ChitterChitterSqueak,4,Sun May 31 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"What an odd situation. Your husbandry is great. You obviously have researched and know what you're doing. You got a vet's assistance. You're doing everything anybody could possibly do to ensure a healthy dragon.  Unfortunately, sometimes something is just wrong with them that's seemingly unique. I hope he continues to improve. Humans have millions of odd, small number of population disorders. It stands to reason that our beardie buddies would too. He obviously has his best chance with you."
BeardedDragons,37x7p3,ChitterChitterSqueak,4,Sun May 31 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you! He is the most wonderful lizard I could ask for. Obviously the added expense and effort of a special needs dragon are something everyone hopes to avoid, but doing everything in my power to keep him healthy and happy is my only goal.  Thankfully he likes his medicine. The pharmacy made it strawberry flavored for me. They have never mixed up such a small dose of Tylenol and Prednisone before though!"
BeardedDragons,37x7p3,ChitterChitterSqueak,2,Sun May 31 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"Little love! For some reason the dragons that need you most really grab on tightly to your heart. It's not that you love them more, it's something else. My first dragon ended up really special needs. She's my heart beardie. I even have a tattoo of her. These little lizards are able to just dig into you."
BeardedDragons,37x7p3,ChitterChitterSqueak,2,Sun May 31 15:00:17 2015 UTC,Most cases are certainly the result of insufficient UV and calcium. Reading about MBD and hearing that it's always a husbandry issue makes it embarrassing to talk about though.
BeardedDragons,37x7p3,KerRAWR,2,Sun May 31 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"I can see why that would be frustrating for you. People will automatically assume that you did something wrong because that's the majority of the MBD cases that are seen. Honestly, I'd make that mistake as well. My first inclination would be to question your husbandry choices when, obviously, you've do e everything right."

BeardedDragons,37xkqo,auryncharm,1 point,Sun May 31 12:03:33 2015 UTC,"He has basically crushed walnut shell substrate, he has a UVB lamp, his cage is 90° F average, not sure what you mean about brand and type but he's 3 and a half years old, he gets a bath every two weeks and I mist him daily between then."
BeardedDragons,37xkqo,auryncharm,2,Sun May 31 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"There is a couple of things that are red flags.  Walnut shell substrate is really a no no for beardies.  If they ingest any of it, it can cause an impaction (which may be what your buddy is dealing with).  Also, your UVB should be a tube style fluorescent that covers 2/3 if his enclosure or more and it should be replaced every six months (the UVB output diminishes over time even if the bulb still lights up).  Or, if you prefer, you can use a mercury vapor bulb for basking and UVB in one so long as it is placed within the recommended distance from the basking spot.  Not getting adequate UVB over time will affect appetite as well once the start of bone disease sets in.  I would advise you to bring your friend to the vet to rule out impaction or bone disease as the problem."

BeardedDragons,37u8wm,girzim23,3,Sat May 30 13:03:40 2015 UTC,If theyre really young then yes there is a thing as too big. You dont want them to have to excessivly run around to catch their food. They would be burning more calories than they consume. Im sure the side bar has more information. Good luck with your new little guy!!!!!!
BeardedDragons,37u8wm,Panda_Melody,3,Sat May 30 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this. It can also be difficult for the young lizards to find any food to eat when the cage is too large. I would recommend buying a large cage and then partitioning it into larger and larger areas as the lizard grows, to save you buying more than one."
BeardedDragons,37u8wm,abrown15,3,Sat May 30 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"Height can be an issue sometimes.  UVB losses effectiveness after so many inches (depending on the brand). So 150 gallons sounds like a good size for your beardie as long as it is wide and long, rather than tall.   If it is tall, you can counter it by giving them elevated branched and rocks to climb on to get closer to the UVB.  HOWEVER, keep in mind that bigger tanks need more wattage (or more lamps) to keep properly heated, so keep this in mind when ""designing"" their interior. You don't want an elevated spot that sits close under a bask light, it can bake the little one.   Hope this helps"

BeardedDragons,37quim,doublepulse,3,Fri May 29 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Eryngium foetidum:       Eryngium foetidum is a tropical perennial and annual herb in the family Apiaceae. Its scientific Latin name literally translates as ""foul-smelling thistle"". Common names include culantro (/kuːˈlɑːntroʊ/ or /kuːˈlæntroʊ/), Mexican coriander and long coriander. It is native to Mexico and South America, but is cultivated worldwide. In the United States, where it is not well known outside Latino and Caribbean communities, the name culantro sometimes causes confusion with Coriandrum sativum (also in Apiaceae), the leaves of which are known as cilantro, and of which culantro is said to taste like a stronger version.

You don't want red bulbs, they'll damage your buddy's eyes, and keep him up at night. If your tank gets below 65f at night, then you'd want a CHE.  The downfall of heat rocks and UTH (under the tank heaters) is that beardies have a poor sense of heat from their bellies, so they could end up getting too hot and never realize it."
BeardedDragons,37ouj4,majorkurn,1 point,Fri May 29 06:12:54 2015 UTC,"I have both, and they're both reading close-ish. Analog says 85-90; digital is hovering right around 85-80.  And oh dear!! I had the dark blue bulbs, but one was defective, and then I dropped the other, so this is only my second night using the red bulbs. Regardless, in the morning, the warmest spot in the terrarium is 70ish degrees.   I knew poor heat sensing on the belly is why heat rocks should be avoided, and I was wary of mats for the same reason, but  I'm sort of at a loss. If I stuck the mat to the outside of one of the tank walls, would that help?"

I’m assuming CHE is ceramic heating element?  Because I bought a 100 watt one that’s pretty compact today, and that’s helping quite a bit.  The tank has gone up about 5 degrees in as many hours, and Cyrus is digging in his dig bowl!  I also noticed that he’s just started molting.  Would that make him kind of lethargic?"

If so make sure the probe is ON their basking spot.  If it's stuck on the glass you're going to get a false reading. (If it was on the glass and you move it give it about 45 minutes to give you the exact temperature.)

BeardedDragons,37idmg,Zixxer,8,Wed May 27 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, first step is not to panic.  Some beardies with this disease still can live a pretty normal life.  My Boo has it too and also has appetite issues as well.  She gets vegetable slurries and baby food veggies and fruits that I dribbler on her snout and feed her that way.  She does not touch her salad at all (but I still put one into her enclosure to try and encourage her).  What I do for her (and this has been cleared through my herp vet) is I give her a couple of drops of milk thistle in her slurry on a daily basis.  Adenovirus tends to cause liver issues over time and milk thistle helps to protect the liver and improve its function.  I also give her serrapeptase (a couple of drops) daily in her slurry which acts as a natural anti-inflammatory.  She also gets Healx Booster which is a monolaurin supplement to boost her immune system twice a week (has the ability to kill off certain bacteria and viruses to prevent secondary infections which can be easier for an adenopositive beardie to contract).  I also make sure that she gets plenty of fluids to drink and regular baths a few times a week.  My beardie seems to do well with this regimen.  But, I would also ask Tracie about care as well.  She had done so much research on this and her advice has been so incredibly valuable to my beardie's health.  You can private message her at www.beardeddragon.org.  She is a moderator there (Drache613) and she generally responds within 24 hours.  Oh yeah, I get my milk thistle and serrapeptase here- www.beardeddragon.co, and my Healx Booster here- http://store.harrisonsbirdfoods.com/mobile/BOOSTER/productinfo/BOOSTER/."
BeardedDragons,37idmg,auryncharm,2,Wed May 27 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"Ugh I've been panicking since I got the news :( I force fed her for the first two months of having her because she refused to eat so I know how baby food feedings work.. I knew about how the secondary infections are usually what cause the rapid decline, and I was told by Tracie to invest in some be pollen to keep her immune system up. I'm calling the vet tomorrow to see what they have to say, and I'll be taking a trip to petsmart to make them aware that one of their breeders are selling sick babies. Thank you so much for the advise, it puts my mind at ease a bit."
BeardedDragons,37idmg,B0UNDL3SS,3,Thu May 28 01:43:23 2015 UTC,"My Boo is going strong.  She's now 3 years old and still doing very well.  It's kind of time consuming to care for her, but I remind myself that I need to be patient since this is not her fault.  And to tell you the truth, if she wound up in someone else's care, would she be in as good of health as she is now (guessing probably not with a lot of the people that I've seen mistreat these guys).    I would definitely recommend letting PETsMART know about their breeder.  I did the same for my Boo when I found out.  I got her from Petco actually.  Surprisingly though, they responded very well and the store near me stopped selling then briefly while they found a new breeder after I said something (but they also had employees of theirs that had bought some of the sick beardies).  My vet didn't day much about bee pollen, but did recommend the Healx Booster (even though it's sold by a company that deals with bird products, reptiles and birds are so physiologically close that she felt it would benefit her)."
BeardedDragons,37idmg,auryncharm,2,Thu May 28 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"That's what I keep telling myself :/ even if/when she loses the battle, I adopted her and her cute stubby tail knowing that she was different and would need some extra love, and I tried my hardest to give her a happy home with lots of attention. I'll definitely talk to my vet tomorrow and see what they have to say, but I'm putting all of the things you recommended on my shopping list asap. As well as sanitizing and disinfecting both of my babies tanks and utensils. I fear that my big guy contracted it, but I bought him from Petsmart as well and he could've come from the same breeder... Thank you so much for all of the kind words and advice..."
BeardedDragons,37idmg,B0UNDL3SS,2,Thu May 28 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"I cannot begin to thank you enough for sharing this information with us. I'm sorry to hear about your little one as well, but it's relieves me to know you're taking such good care of him. I'll be in direct contact with Tracie within these next couple days, and will mention the regimen you've posted. She hasn't started star gazing yet, so I'm assuming it hasn't hit her nervous system quite yet. Do you know how long Atadenoviris carriers usually last before falling victim and passing away to the disease?"
BeardedDragons,37idmg,auryncharm,1 point,Thu May 28 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"She may not stargaze at all.  My Boo never did.  That's the thing about atadenovirus, it affects beardies all differently.  Some may have appetite issues, some may not.  Some may stargaze while others won't.  Some will suffer with neurological side effects while others will never have any problems.  And still, some may just be carriers with no symptoms at all.  That being said, there's really no way to know how long a beardie will survive with this.  I think that earlier detection and the sooner you begin a care regimen increases their chances of a much longer lifespan.  I'm very thankful that I found out about Boo early on."
BeardedDragons,37idmg,auryncharm,2,Thu May 28 02:09:13 2015 UTC,"Makes sense for it differing between dragons. Most of her symptoms didn't match besides her hiding, digging, and not eating so I wasn't sure if it was that at first. But that's exactly what we're right away, the sooner she starts a regimen the stronger her immune system will be."

Scared the crap out of me at first until I realized she was ok.  Keep an eye out for that behavior in the future and make her a dig box.

He'll calm down once he gets used to the new tank. A lot of people say to just let them be in their tank for a few days once you bring them home and only go in to give them food and water though I never could do that personally because I was too excited. If you are worried about him running off you could always just hold him in his tank. Probably not as easy or fun but it'll allow him to get used to being held more while also keeping him in the tank if he decides to jump off. Just remember, give him time."
BeardedDragons,37j27n,Chipinators,1 point,Thu May 28 02:47:04 2015 UTC,Just keep handling him so he gets use to you and comfortable. A worn t shirt in the tank might help to familiarize him with your smell
BeardedDragons,37j27n,WheresMyDietDrKelp,1 point,Thu May 28 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"I like using short handling sessions a few times a day in the beginning, to get the dragon accustomed to being picked up, taken out, and put back as a routine. It's a good idea to give a new dragon a few days of non-handling so they can get used to their surroundings and food/light schedule, which will (hopefully) help them relax a little.  If you have an active baby, I really like sitting down, preferably on a bed or the floor, and letting my dragon walk from hand to hand like a treadmill. Be safe and hold them close to the ground or a surface so they don't accidentally slip away from you and fall a long distance."
BeardedDragons,37g4ot,Chipinators,1 point,Wed May 27 11:28:06 2015 UTC,"No reason to wait - dubia are more than tiny enough at birth for a dragon to eat.  However, unless you have a colony set up, it will be a very expensive way to feed your dragon at the rate he needs as a baby."
BeardedDragons,37g4ot,merlyn923,1 point,Wed May 27 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"I've always fed twitch Dubias.  You can get 1k extra small for $30 which is not bad at all while you start your colony.  Twitch took almost 3 months to eat them all.  Then you can get some mediums.  Or smalls, and by the time your beardie is done with them, your colony is up and going. Cheap feeders and good for them too."
BeardedDragons,37g4ot,Dravorak,1 point,Wed May 27 21:09:35 2015 UTC,What site are you ordering from? I ordered the starter option 2 colony from Dubia Deli today. That comes with around 114 XS but I'm not sure if those are intended to be feeders right off the bat or used to grow your colony first then use the next batch of nymphs for feeders (this is going to be my first colony so I'm new at it). Also would XS be too big for a baby beardie? I'm guessing they should be fine?  I'm debating on ordering more small ones so I have feeding ones while the colony gets started. Right now the largest quantity of XXS they have 500 count for $35.

I burnt a HUGE hole in my plastic and I had to air the house out for over 12 hours. Beardie is perfectly fine and all, but it melted quickly into the tank. Thankfully it didn't get on anything.  But good luck with Cyrus! He's a cutie!!"
BeardedDragons,37f4wv,repti_lover,2,Wed May 27 23:41:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!!  I have a digital thermometer, too.  The bit that measures the temperature is mounted near the hammock, but the part that displays the temperature is sitting outside the tank.  That’s so terrifying about the plastic melting!  What do you recommend I do to keep that from happening?"

BeardedDragons,37e1f8,Sam3323,10,Tue May 26 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think so. Ours LOVE my husband. He rarely struggles when he goes to pick him up and seems a lot calmer when being held by him. If he sits on the floor while the dragon is loose in the room, Wazee will curl up in his lap and nap a lot of times. Sadly, he won't usually do any of this for me! But he's still pretty mellow, so it's not totally unbearable or difficult for me to handle him if need be."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,dontcryferguson,5,Tue May 26 23:29:30 2015 UTC,Mine definitely prefers me to my wife or kid. He is far more comfortable with letting me handle him and generally more trusting of me.
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,SquirrelTactic,5,Wed May 27 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Bearded dragons are sociable animals as far as reptiles go, although they do not get along with other bearded dragons."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,parkmeeae,4,Wed May 27 04:47:08 2015 UTC,"Your beardie will DEFINITELY recognize you and assuming you're a good owner, will be more comfortable with you over other humans.  I say this from experience, as my beardie was an absolute demon to my poor friends I suckered into taking care of him when I went on vacation, and then he would be totally personable once he saw me upon my return home (I did not realize he was going to suffer a huge personality change in my absence, which goes to show that reptiles are not oblivious to their environments; lesson learned, if you ever have to go on vacation, leave your beardie at home and have someone come to the house rather than boarding him at their house if at all possible).  Now, whether they LIKE you is a different debate.  You could argue that they don't have any particular feelings toward you, but rather your presence represents stability and safety.  As a rule animals like stability and routine and changes in routine (such as suddenly being cared for by a different person) will make them anxious."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,Rukita,7,Wed May 27 07:49:05 2015 UTC,I was always joke around about how my Bruce is the smartest being alive.

He's also more keen to eat and move around his cage if I'm home and moving around myself."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,Syraphia,1 point,Wed May 27 07:14:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't used to think my beardie was keen on me at all and just tolerated me. Especially as I re-homed her as an adult. But then I had to go away for 3-4 days and had my friend pop round every morning and evening to give her fresh food and stay for a little company. From what I can gather, my friend spoiled her a little and seemed happy enough. The night that I came home, she was sitting on her branch and spotted my feet - no reaction. But when I bent down and she saw my face she got really excited. She had some serious snuggles and fell asleep on me.   I think it's funny because she often doesn't seem interested in me but as soon as I move away my girlfriend thinks she becomes alert and is looking for me or looking to see what I'm doing."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,skyhawks29,1 point,Wed May 27 09:52:12 2015 UTC,"I seem to disagree with most of these comments, but no, they do not ""like"" their owners. They may be able to identify certain individuals vs others and be more scared/less confident around some people or things, but they do not like, need or benefit from any kind of physical interaction with their owners (excluding the fact that a dragon that is scared of people may be stressed out while in its enclosure or being handled for routine procedures - frequent handling may reduce their fear of people which could be detrimental in those situations).  While in the wild, bearded dragons live solitary lives. When they see another living animal they either try to eat it, run away from it, fight it, or mate it. Bearded dragons and most other reptiles have very poorly developed social reasoning.  Edit: You will also notice that most/all of these posts represent personal, anecdotal evidence, which holds almost no weight. Look up some peer-reviewed articles for more, relevant information"
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,abrown15,2,Wed May 27 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, some more recent research says otherwise.  http://www.mlive.com/living/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/10/reptiles_cognition_social_lear.html  Not that this shows they ""like"" their owners, but instead they may actually have some social ability, and social animals tend to be more intelligent, on average. Not to mention, keeping animals in captivity changes their natural, wild behaviors and it is possible that domesticated beardies overtime may actually be driving their traits to a more intelligent and/ or social animal."
BeardedDragons,37e1f8,hstarbird11,1 point,Thu May 28 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"That paper was interesting to read. The sample size of 12 and the fact that they ""used 12 bearded dragons that had never been used in experiments in cognition"" before labels this as more of an introductory paper. The unanimous difference between groups was pretty intriguing, though. Bearded dragons are known to be asocial in the wild, but I could see your point about domestication. I'm not sure how far we have come with bearded dragons in a few decades, however. I know that, at least in Canada, we do not currently consider them domesticated.  I would also add that, as you said, there is still little/no evidence for the original claim, that bearded dragons ""like"" their owners."

BeardedDragons,37dwd6,zbrnwsk,8,Tue May 26 22:31:44 2015 UTC,"What's the point/benefit?  They don't live on a loose substrate in the wild, so it's not like you're depriving them of something they would naturally have?  If your dragon likes to burrow, you can make or buy a small box filled with flax seed for him to dig in. Otherwise, there is no reason to go to loose substrate."

BeardedDragons,37dwd6,majorkurn,-3,Wed May 27 02:22:05 2015 UTC,"I use millet seed. It's literally seed, so if it gets eaten, it's digested or expelled. It clumps kind of like cat litter so I just scoop it with a reptile litter scoop (small holes) every once in a while. I've used calcium sand before, personally I think it gets stinky quicker than the millet. I don't know who suggested play sand, but that's an awful idea. Play sand is silica. It's basically crushed glass, sharp, indigestable, glass. Calcium sand is round, smooth, digestible calcium. Much, much safer."

BeardedDragons,378w2y,YourFriendlyWhiteGuy,1 point,Mon May 25 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"I don't keep mine in something that short. Technically, they need more floor space than height. The only issues would be if the added height of cage furniture made getting out possible in any way and venting/overheating. Since the space is shorter the cubic volume of air will be lessened. Like in any small space with heated air this means the ambient air temperature will be higher. Beardies appreciate a 10°f temperature of ambient air between hot side (95°f) and cool side (85°f). This mat be hard to achieve with a tank that short."
BeardedDragons,377e11,Beardies999,2,Mon May 25 14:13:55 2015 UTC,I would take him to the vet asap. This doesn't look like something for the Internet to diagnose.
BeardedDragons,377e11,hey-im-grumpette,1 point,Mon May 25 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"I would've thought it was MBD as well, but once they get it it can't be fixed unless caught on super early. Was he always like this even before you got him? I know for some reptiles if they get MBD their bones will fuse into place after. That beardie could've been in the wrong position at the wrong time, but I would go to a vet. They could properly diagnose him and maybe give him something to feel better. It's possible he suffered an injury before you got him or he was born with it. It looks like he still catches food and if he poops okay still then he could still have a good life."
BeardedDragons,377e11,tiffers1993,2,Mon May 25 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I bought him from the shop and noticed his back legs were a bit strange but thought I was just being paranoid but as he has grown it hasn't got worse but has become more noticable.   My problem is there are no vets in my area that will help with reptiles, I had the same problem with my last beardie until a vet said they'd 'have a look' and they ended up putting her down because her condition was untreatable and she was suffering.  He catches food fine (struggles with crickets because he stumbles a bit) and poops normally so I suppose he'll be okay. It's just hard to watch him try to walk around and it's a struggle to get him out because he can't sit on my shoulder or anything. Hopefully he'll be okay!"

Either a specific pet-friendly cleaner or a mixture of vinegar and water will work perfectly fine, and be MUCH safer than bleach!  That being said, I give Warra a bath in our bathroom sink and since he makes a big show before doing the deed, I just catch it in my hand and toss it in the toilet, then rinse the sink out without any special cleaner.

BeardedDragons,36zms2,Kitehammer,1 point,Sat May 23 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"Wal Mart carries a store brand 1lb bag of collard, mustard, kale and turnip greens; it's a great mix for beardies. If your young one doesn't want to eat, be sure to give him the greens early in the day and wait to feed crickets until the late afternoon/evening. If he is hungry, he will munch on greens while waiting for the crickets."
BeardedDragons,371pmk,TingPing42,2,Sun May 24 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"You should always feed your beardie outside of their viv, especially with crickets. The nasty little buggers bite and can cause serious damage (including, but not limited to, eating parts of their eyelids, toes, or any other fragile body parts). It also makes removing the uneaten insects and putting them back into their keepers much easier, leading to fewer dead bugs not in your beardie's tummy. Exotics veterinarians recommend feeding outside of their vivs for safety and behavioral reasons. It will help to establish a predictable pattern with yours. Placing them in a separate location for eating signifies it's meal time, and he/she may eat more insects because of it."
BeardedDragons,371pmk,dm1381a,1 point,Sun May 24 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just got my beardy on Sunday. I'm really glad I happened onto your post. I can't get my dragon to eat outside of his vivarium. I've got a separate container for him to eat in.  It's basically a large tupperware bowl that I'll put 5 or 10 crickets in. But he just sits....When I put a couple in his little home yesterday and left him for a few minutes I came back and he had eaten them.  I'm really worried because he hasn't eaten much other then a few crickets and a small amount of greens. I know he's probably just stressed from the move, but I'm really worried about him. Any tips or am I doing things right and he's just being difficult?"
BeardedDragons,371pmk,hammerpatrol,1 point,Wed May 27 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm sorry for the late response.   I think there might be a couple things you could try: First, you could place a vivarium background around a plastic container (that's plenty big for your baby) to help with a sense of security. Four clear walls is pretty exposing, which is scary for young beardies.   Second, depending on the color of the container and if you dust your crickets, they may blend into the container and make it harder for them to see their food. Try feeding your beardie in a container that's under a basking lamp or UV strip. I pull my UV strip to the side of the viv and have my feeding container there. It gives her enough light to see, and UV is important anyways (and increases appetite, but I doubt that the short period of time they're in the corner actually makes a difference). To the same effect, you could put a black pillowcase or something underneath the container while feeding.   Make sure you don't overwhelm you baby with crickets. Start with one or two, gently plopped into the container near their head. They're sensitive to movement and hopefully this will stimulate the excitement to eat.   Finally, if they won't eat the crickets in there try another favorite food. Prickly pears are rarely refused, if you can find them. Maybe try Phoenix worms or pellets too. Dubia roaches are another favorite (and are a phenomenal feeder for so many reasons--I'd recommend looking into it). If you can establish the behavior of eating in the environment they'll do it in the future.   Remember that beardies are sensitive to change, and it takes time for them to settle in. Between the new home and not having a set routine your beardie is under some stress. Just keep trying, and eventually you will have success.   A good option if they still aren't eating is Fluker's Repta Boost. It's a supplement that helps them meet their nutritional needs when they won't eat and also stimulates appetite. It's a powder you mix with water and feed by placing small amounts on their nose for them to lick off (you can put it directly in their mouth, but have to be careful as they can aspirate the liquid into their lungs which leads to RIs).   Most importantly though is to make sure you get your beardie checked by an exotics vet. Usually this appointment should be scheduled for about two weeks from when the come home. Sometimes these behavioral things are harmless, but you should have an annual check anyways so it's worth a visit. Most baby beardies carry coccidia, pinworms, and many other parasites. They'll also be able to give you even better advice and knowledge than I, or the rest of the Internet, can."
BeardedDragons,371pmk,dm1381a,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:16:43 2015 UTC,Hey I took some of this advice and my guy (at least I think it's a guy) ate 22 crickets yesterday!  I got a reptisun tube uvb light. I think that really helped. I tried Fluker pellets but he just made a mess of them and didn't eat any. I tried meal worms but he completely ignored them. He's done a decent job of eating his greens since I got him though. Mustard and Collard. I got him to eat a piece of bell pepper out of my hand yesterday as well. He's got a lot more friendly toward me as well (I think).   I noticed that he changes color A LOT. He goes from dark brown to bright yellow. I didn't realize that they changed color so drastically. I guess it makes it easy to tell when something's wrong. I think he's in the process of shedding now. He has a couple little flakes come off near his mouth nose the other day but I haven't noticed anything else.   Thanks for the tips. I really appreciate it. This is really stressful for a noob like me lol. But I love my little guy already.   Oh and the vet is scheduled for Tuesday!
BeardedDragons,371pmk,hammerpatrol,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad to hear it!! The UVB tubes are an absolute essential. Bearded dragons will stop eating and can actually die without sufficient UVB. I would suggest getting a UV meter when you can so you can continually check when your bulb is no longer emitting enough UV Rays. It's usually somewhere between 4-6 months after installation.   The changing colors isn't too concerning. They tend to do that in response to stress/body temp/excitement/etc. If you notice that your beardie is displaying stress marks or is consistently darker in coloration it does suggest something is off--probably temperature gradient. But if they fluctuate colors throughout the day there's no reason to worry.   When they shed they tend to get a little more dull or dark looking. Giving your beardie a bath daily during shedding will help the process along. Use warm water for 10-20 minutes making sure the level is to their elbows and not above it. Many beardies love to swim, so it should be a good experience for him.   Hand feeding is a great way to establish a bond between you two. I do it every day with her greens. It helps with trust and reinforcement that you provide food, which they like you for (or so I believe--some people think beardies don't actually feel affection but just tolerate interaction. I disagree with that view, but that's beyond my point). Collards and mustard greens are a great staple. I use those or turnip greens, and will add in some other veggies/fruits periodically.   I'm happy to hear you're going to the vet soon. Make sure you talk to your herp vet about your setup with lighting/feeding/supplements etc. so you can make sure you're providing the correct environment and nutrition. I could supply the information I've learned from mine over time, and am happy to answer questions, but I don't have my DVM degree yet so they are better equipped to give advice and instructions. I would suggest even bringing a notebook to take notes about what they say. Also, try to bring a fresh (no more than a day old--preferably less) fecal sample. Testing for parasites is incredibly important with new beardies, but also annually to make sure any bacteria/parasites are within safe limits.   Most vet offices are also really great about answering questions over the phone as they arise, so don't hesitate to call if you notice something is up or just have a general question. The Internet can sometimes give you answers, but not everybody who gives advice actually knows what they're talking about."
BeardedDragons,371pmk,dm1381a,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"Also, try to introduce more variety of fresh foods. For example, Willow is obsessed with strawberries and will eat nearly anything you mash in with them. She loves collard greens and turnip greens (but hates the dandelion greens). They're picky little critters sometimes.   More likely than not it is from the stress of the move. My girl didn't settle in for at least a week or two, and it took much longer for her to trust and be very affectionate with me.   Let me know how your new baby is doing."
BeardedDragons,371pmk,dm1381a,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:36:31 2015 UTC,You shouldn't leave any live insects in the enclosure while he sleeps.  Crickets have been known to bite animals while they sleep.  He should be allowed to eat as much as he can in a 15 minute period two to three times per day.  Then any remaining crickets should be removed.  You can certainly try to feed him in a separate container.  I used to put crickets into a Tupperware container dusted with calcium and carefully tip and hold it so that my beardie could put her front legs and head in to eat.  This way they couldn't jump out so easily and pretty much stayed in the container while she ate.
BeardedDragons,371pmk,auryncharm,1 point,Sun May 24 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"Like everyone has said, feed him in a different container of you can and absolutely do not let the crickets be in there overnight. If you want something that you don't have to worry about getting away and hiding and biting you might try Phoenix or Repti worms. That's what I'm mainly feeding mine while I'm waiting for my dubia colony to get going and Han loves them. I'm still a new owner but I mix things up with crix and dubia still too. I feed him in his viv but I limit how many crickets I give him. I know he will typically eat between. 10 and 15 so I give him around that and then maybe a couple more if he still seems kinda hungry. Saves me from having to hunt down the little buggers usually."

For Dovah, I was having to run two basking lamps to keep his home warm enough until I put a piece of 1/2"" foam insulation inside the bottom frame of the aquarium.

Leaning up against the glass (glass surfing) is pretty normal for babies. They like to climb and run around. As long as you are feeding him normal amounts of crickets or baby roaches he should be fine. Also he should have calcium as well.
BeardedDragons,36x1u9,ImObsessed1235,1 point,Fri May 22 21:32:57 2015 UTC,What is normal. I've basically been feeding him 3 to 5 times a day until he gets uninterested in the bugs. And Yah I use a calcium powder and he eats mostly crickets and dubia roaches (I'm about out of roaches that are small enough) and a couple of mealworms every once and a while.
BeardedDragons,36x1u9,ImObsessed1235,1 point,Fri May 22 21:43:24 2015 UTC,Yeah that is a fine feeding schedual. When my got older I fed it less often but more at a time.

It's normal, all he's known is inside and now there's sun and sounds and more than likely birds, which is their main predator in the wild. If you start out slow, a few minutes at a time and then increase it he will get more comfortable. I would recommend either holding him or having him on a leash or in an enclosure.

And it just never made sense to me; a reptile that lives in an arid environment would have very poor evolutionary fitness if water was easily passable through a major orifice like its vent.  Their entire bodies are built to conserve water as tightly as possible!  Even a human being, immersed in water, would die of thirst well before enough water passed through our butts to keep us hydrated; why do we persisit in thinking this works differently in herps?  I figured this would be an interesting read for people, and possibly start some discussion.  I've attempted to find the research cited, and while I've found some with the citations, the actual papers are sadly behind a pay wall."

A bath gives them opportunity to drink water, but research has shown that they absorb the equivalent of a few drops of water, maximum, ventrally.    This post goes into the discussion in more depth, with research citations.  I'm really not sure why this myth is so popular... If you think about it logically, it makes no sense at all. :/"
BeardedDragons,36r0r8,majorkurn,1 point,Thu May 21 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that.  Mader Reptile Medicine And Surgery, a Veterinary handbook has a whole section on the importance of the cloaca which says ""the cloaca and vent represent the terminus of the gastrointestinal tract.  Although the cloaca is routinely considered nothing more than the terminus of the gastrointestinal, reproductive and excretory systems, it also plays an important role in the absorption of electrolytes and passive absorption of fluids""."
BeardedDragons,36r0r8,TomPalmer1979,2,Fri May 22 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"But that's my point - there's anecdotal ""reptiles absorb water through the cloaca.""  There's no actual evidence.  The actual research done by a Dr. Wade Sherbrook has shown otherwise.  Lizards, especially desert species, get water in all sorts of odd ways - fine evolutionary tuning to make their scales attract dew and chunt it towards... their mouth.  But there's absolutely no indication or study that proves they intake water through the cloaca.  Unfortunately, I don't consider even a vet book to be a valid source without a citing study that says otherwise. And the studies.. do say otherwise  I actually set a separate post today that links to something I found -- http://www.reptileforums.co.uk/forums/lizards/1031252-absoption-water-through-cloaca-vent.html -- I've tried looking up the sourced citations, but sadly I don't have a spare ~$30 to pay for the actual PDF copies of the studies.  Edit:  This is what I could find. Moisture harvesting and water transport through specialized micro-structures on the integument of lizards Hydration Therapy is interesting, particularly this spot:     At times various individuals were seen to lap water from stony surfaces, or “rain harvest”, lick leaves or evenattempt  to extract  moisture  from  wet  sand.  Curiously,  not once did any of them approach a larger pool (6” x 18”) of water that was reconstituted each time the sprinklers were turned on and remained for only 10-15 minutes after they were shut off.  However, one particular female P. cornutum when placed in the pool stood up to her knees and drank some water before scampering off.     Osmoregulation in Amphibians and Reptiles This, unfortunately, is the one I don't have the money to view. ;p  I've got it bookmarked for when I have a bit more free cash next month, personally.  Also, further down in the original thread I linked above, the OP says this:     I would like to give a bit of an update too. I contacted a few authors of the studies Ive read lately regarding this subject (Dr Wade Sherbrooke, Dr Glenn Tattersall, Dr Doug Mader, Dr Paul M Gibbons). The last two are very well known vets (Im sure many of you will recognize the names) who teach other vets and write textbooks and other vet manuals for reptile treatments. They universally agreed that lizards do not exhibit any cloacal drinking, as they called it, and that this was considered common knowledge in the scientific field. One of them actually seemed to find it quaint that I was bothering to ask still. I felt a little foolish for not being more up on current research in the end."

A couple months ago, I started buying crickets from Fluker Farms.  I have a coworker who also has a Bearded Dragon, so we're able to split shipping.  I order 500 crickets at a time for each of us; his Beardie is smaller than ours, so they're two different sizes.  I have a 10 gallon aquarium with a screen top that I keep them in, and I've found that I get the least die-off when I give them both food and orange slices.  Water gel and Fluker orange cube don't work as well for me as the orange slices do.  The upside?  I'm paying around 3.5 cents per cricket. The downside? 500 crickets stinks and it's another enclosure I have to clean and feed.  I also had one batch where a noticable percentage died off after the first couple of days.  I've made 8 or 10 orders.  I started a Dubia colony last week, in hopes that I can quit buying crickets."
BeardedDragons,36n69d,redneckrockuhtree,2,Wed May 20 18:21:02 2015 UTC,Do the dubias stink less?

BeardedDragons,36jswz,palozola,1 point,Tue May 19 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"I got my ceramic tile at Lowe's.  Got a good deal on a box where one of the tiles was damaged but the rest were fine and more than enough for what I needed.  They took half of the sale price.    The 29 gallon tank will last you a few months, but young beardies grow fast and you will need an upgrade quickly.  Honestly, you are best to just use a 40 gallon breeder.  Petco has their dollar per gallon sales fairly regularly.  That is one of the cheapest prices that I've found for these (unless you can find one used).    As for crickets, how often you feed will depend upon the age of the beardie.  Under a year, the beardie will need to eat as many crickets/insects as it wants within a 15 minute period twice a day (this can sometimes total 80 to 100 crickets a day, so be prepared).  If the beardie is an adult, then it will generally get crickets/insects about 3 times a week.  My best suggestion would be to give the care guide and nutrition guide a read in the sidebar- http://www.beautifuldragons.com/Nutrition.html, https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4-LK25H4wfvMFJTVXJZaUExT3M/edit?pli=1."

BeardedDragons,36jswz,auryncharm,1 point,Wed May 20 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"The nutrition guide has a bunch of acceptable veggies and fruits as well as live feeder information.  But, a good life of greens is as follows: Collards, mustard greens, turnip greens, arugala, escarole, endive, chicory, alfalfa greens, dandelion greens, and clover.  I'd always bought my crickets in bulk shipped from a cricket farm (like www.armstrongcrickets.com or www.flukerfarms.com).  I kept them in a large clear Rubbermaid tote with holes drilled in the lid.  I would scoop out the dead crickets and poo daily to control the cricket smell (they are stinky).  You may want to consider trying to establish a dubia roach or discoid roach colony instead.  These can be pretty self sustaining, less expensive and far less smelly than crickets."

If he knows he is going to get essentially junk food later, then he isn't going to eat greens. Only offer greens for a couple days or week.

BeardedDragons,36jpn0,MagentaMoose,2,Tue May 19 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"Correct. Ours only gets insects a few days a week, and veggies only the rest of the time (5 days). We give them fresh every morning. As long as you stick to this and don't give in, they will do better ate eating their veggies. Just try to offer a variety to learn what they like.

This doesn't mean don't play with her, but you shouldn't be moving her around just because you think it might be better for her.  When you put her back in after handling her, just drop her on the hammock. If she goes down, its not where she wants to be, and that's perfectly okay.  Its alright, we've all been there.

Second is absolutely recommend an IR thermometer if you are at all concerned about temperatures, they only measure surface temps but it gives an accurate read in under a second and you can quickly check all the regions of the habitat, especially favored areas.  You can always return it but they're only 30 bucks and extremely useful.  Side note: I really don't like sliding doors that much, they are noisy and they usually suck and you can only half open the front.  Of course they are easier and cheaper than doors which require a flush fit, hinges and a latch.  Another style I saw and really liked had the whole top on a hinge, and held up by automotive trunk struts, when open in this manner the entire front could hinge forward and down as well which made for really nice access but required mounting the lighting to the top door/lid."

I also have never had to block openings or anything.  However, I do supervise her while she's out and never leave her unattended while she's exploring."
BeardedDragons,36axbk,auryncharm,1 point,Sun May 17 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"i've got smooth floors (no carpet) and it's freaking hillarious watching baha or mal run/slide across the floor. I let them out one at a time to keep them from fighting/mating. Baha i trust to be out of my view more, but Mal i shut the bedroom/bathroom/workshop doors and just let her be in the living room and the halls. I think it's just a matter of how used to your home your beardie is, how safe it is for things on the floor (in case they lick/eat it) and how many hidey holes there are."
BeardedDragons,36axbk,majorkurn,1 point,Mon May 18 00:08:14 2015 UTC,"I let mine out several  times a week. I have carpet  and tile. I just make sure the tile is swept and the carpet vacuumed. Also if you have other pets introduce them slowly, my breardy runs around with my two dogs and two cats now and I have no problems."
BeardedDragons,36axbk,51unforgiven,1 point,Mon May 18 00:49:13 2015 UTC,"No, only block off things you won't be able to lift if he decides to camp under there (fridges etc). Apart from that they'll go under most things to explore. No Initially I would supervise him until you start to understand his favourite spots. Then you can kinda block some areas off and leave him alone for short whiles.   I let my boy out in our lounge/dining room and close off doors. Except the one that leads past my office. I can hear him bumping around and check up on him every hour or so. I know all his little hiding spots :P"

Personally after ""losing"" Tatsuya under a bed and also when he decided to hide under a small cabinet, I'd suggest putting a leash on your beardie. That way if he does go under something, you'll know where he is and be able to pull him out easier."
BeardedDragons,36a0or,billybrownbear,2,Sun May 17 17:16:06 2015 UTC,noticed this while giving Han a bath. Should I be concerned? It's already grown. Is he just shedding?
BeardedDragons,36a0or,mapex_139,2,Sun May 17 17:33:16 2015 UTC,It appears to be shed. Could you get a picture from top down?

BeardedDragons,36a0or,dettigersfan,1 point,Sun May 17 19:59:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. Looks like shed for sure now. Just give a nice bath every few days and it should peel off.
