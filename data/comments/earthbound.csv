earthbound,3e2mmy,Mrs_Saturn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:23 2015 UTC,"How much were they US dollars? My sister is going there in a couple of weeks, and she said she would pick me up some mother merchandise. I was wondering how common they are, and what the price is"
earthbound,3e2mmy,tojikomori,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:52 2015 UTC,"I saw the pixelated charms/keychains in Gashapon in multiple places. IIRC they were about ¥300 a bubble. First time I noticed Mother 2 Gasha was I think on the 5th floor of DiverCity mall, but I saw them other places too and unless your sister plans to visit Odaiba (e.g. to see the Gundam statue) it's probably not worth the trek. Just ask her to keep her eyes peeled for the Mother 2 logo on a red background whenever she comes across a collection of Gashapon.  Most of the other stuff in this image I only saw at Super Potato in Akihabara. Japanese street addresses are tricky and there are multiple Super Potatoes in Tokyo, so you'll want to be careful to share that precise map location with your sister (unless someone else knows of a better place to go!) Here's a Street View link. That sign with the multicolored lettering saying スーパーポテト is the store front, but the store itself is on floors 3 to 5. You have to walk under that sign to a tiny elevator or a narrow set of stairs and make your way up. IIRC most of the Mother 2 merchandise is on an end cap on the 4th floor.  I'm afraid I don't really remember the prices of the other merchandise, but I think the last row of charms in the image were around ¥600 each, and they were all out of Ness when I visited.  If your sister's not at all into video games or anime, and especially if she doesn't know much Japanese, the trek to and through Super Potato could be a little uncomfortable/intimidating and is probably going to be quite far out of her way, so you may be better off looking for this stuff on eBay or online import/export stores."

So even though for a higher price, I decided to buy them from super potato in Akihabara. I'm sure there are more places where you can find them for cheaper. However, I'm believe the Japanese people are aware of the popularity of mother in the west too so it seems the prices of even the used games have risen."

Big bottle rockets aren't worth it in the long run tbh.   I always loaded Jeff's inventory with MBRs. I used his bazooka only against regular enemies. I never used his standard attack lol.

earthbound,3e4sgp,lonechallenger,2,Tue Jul 21 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"From what I see, physical EarthBound carts are actually dropping in price due to the Virtual Console rerelease. As for EarthBound being overrated, that's completely a person's opinion and a person's opinion alone, and if you believe the game(s) is/are overrated, then that's your opinion. For my own, EarthBound is nothing spectacular when seen at the bare bones; a basic combat system with a mediocre scrolling health meter mechanic, a modern setting against aliens, mostly simplistic character design, decent enough level design, etc. What truly makes EarthBound what it is is the story, the dialogue, the music, the humor, and everything else in between. Those things allow people to truly be touched by the game, and anyone that plays EarthBound with the expectation of a standard RPG will either be disappointed or blown away by the ideals that are carried through the game. I'll be honest, if Ness was never in Smash Bros, the Mother fanbase would be NOWHERE near as large as it is today. While most people learn about EarthBound through Smash, and while this makes many people aware of its existance, you can't truly understand what EarthBound is until you yourself play it. EarthBound is relatively well known, but it doesn't necessarily receive a lot of attention because of that. I'd say it does deserve all the attention it deserves, because it truly is a masterpiece and something that I believe everyone should at least try. Know that you'll receive a lot of bias here too."

The EB community needs support right now considering how obvious it is that the only reason Earthbound and it's prequel are on the virtual console are to gauge the reactions so they'll consider releasing Mother 3 in the USA. So by emulating the game and not buying it, you're hurting the community. If you or a friend owns a Wii U, I strongly suggest you buy the game on the eShop to lend your support, even if you end up playing the rom on your computer.  That said, if you'd read the side-bar you'd know that it's against the rules for anyone to link you to an Earthbound rom on the internet. It takes less than three seconds to find one by searching Google for it.  Although it is a good thing for you to express interest in the games. :) I hope you end up buying it even if you end up playing the rom, and I really hope you enjoy the game.

If your objection isn't purely a legal one, I highly recommend playing it regardless of the game's official localization status just to admire the work done by Tomato, Jeffman, and the other wonderful people over at Starmen.net.  It should be noted also that Nintendo is extremely well aware of the patch and has never issued a cease-and-desist or threatened any form of legal action / takedown. Considering their usual behavior with this sort of thing, some argue that this is tantamount to an endorsement.  Still, I can't say I don't understand where you're coming from."

earthbound,3dopms,A-_N_-T-_H_-O,2,Sat Jul 18 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe I'm biased because it's my favorite of the three, but my train of thought is mostly that when it eventually comes to the Virtual Console, I'm definitely buying it then, but there's more two it than that.  Besides the ROM having a screen before the game starts stating that you should buy it when it comes out, there's also the reason Nintendo hasn't C&D'd it. That's because they know people want it, and aren't losing money as they haven't released it. In addition, if you're concerned with recent events at Nintendo, maybe this will put your mind at ease.  Iwata believed one thing: That games should be fun. I believe, as he is heavily involved in the Mother series, that he would want you to play it. He believed that games should be fun, and would want everyone who could enjoy something to do it, especially a Nintendo game.  That's just how I feel, and I hope that my idea came out alright in text."

earthbound,3dn5u8,8melodies,5,Fri Jul 17 18:23:30 2015 UTC,I agree. Don't play Beginnings first.
earthbound,3dn5u8,duvangrgataonea,6,Sat Jul 18 01:22:53 2015 UTC,I second this. Mother is a rough start and mother three has some references one would want to know before playing. Earthbound is also the essence of the series.
earthbound,3dn5u8,KrazySteve,3,Fri Jul 17 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"When I commented this exact thing on a post, I got downvoted to Giygas' Lair. I have no idea why, though. I do think that starting with EarthBound will get you the best experience (I also think it's a little bit easier than the other 2 games and is a good stepping stone for people unexperienced with RPGs) and starting with Mother 3's smoother graphics and improved bash system may leave the player slightly disappointed when transitioning to Mother 2. This is just my opinion, because i've heard stories of people who had no problem with Mother 1 or didn't mind the transition of 3 to 2. It all boils down to your decision and preference."
earthbound,3dn5u8,Ness6464,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:57 2015 UTC,yeah whats up with downvotes on actually good posts or comments
earthbound,3dn5u8,8melodies,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:22 2015 UTC,I know right? Recently it seems someone went into my post history and downvoted every post I made about Mother 3. Doesn't really make sense to me. :/
earthbound,3dn5u8,sexymafratelli,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, guys. Everything is subjective, and those who played EB first on the original SNES are going to have an opinion on this.  First and foremost, the reason this sub exists is because EB was our most familiar game. It had a wide American release (albeit considerably unsuccessful) on a console that many of us had, and we spent our waking lives in the state of awe as a new and different format of RPG came to us, spoke to us, and ultimately stuck with us 20 some odd years later. Of course it would be the one many recommend to play first.  With M3, the story is beautiful, and it expands on the Mother Universe that most of us first came upon when we played through our initial runs of Earthbound. Similar weird relatable story to offbeat boys and girls, a battle system that mimics that of Earthbound with a bit more specificity and uniqueness to each individual playable character's skillset.  One of the reasons why I agree with this on a personal level is because of the accessibility of this game. It's tougher, the graphics are more basic, and the story only makes sense to many with a translation. For the hardcore gamers out there, playing the original cart may be an option, but it's still part of the universe. For a lot of people, especially those who played EB or M3 previously, Mother is a tougher game to love, but upon completion, we as fans of the series get a deeper appreciation after seeing what that Universe can become."
earthbound,3dn5u8,PK_Thundah,2,Fri Jul 17 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"That's the best order.    Mother is the weakest game in the series and best saved for after playing the better games.  At that point, play it if you're really hungering for ""new"" material, but you can skip it and won't really miss anything overall.  Mother 3 is a chronological sequel to Earthbound, so it makes sense to play after EB - even if it isn't apparent right away."
earthbound,3dn5u8,DNA128k,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:56 2015 UTC,"They should be played in order.  Like they're supposed to be.  And MOTHER is not a weak game, it's easily one of the greatest RPGs of all time.  I can't believe all the hate that game gets in this subreddit."

earthbound,3dn5u8,grumpnotso,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"It's not ""hate"" it's that the game is dated. Mother was a great game in its day, but now you need to want to play it to get enjoyment out of it. Mother 3 and Earthbound are much stronger gameplay wise."
earthbound,3dn5u8,enragedmanatee,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:59:30 2015 UTC,no we dont hate mother its just that its very difficult and we dont want new fans to rage and hate the series cause the first is difficult
earthbound,3dn5u8,Moulinoski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's got dull, repetitive gameplay, terrible balance issues, and really confusing level design. It's a game with a truckload of shortcomings that you need to learn to willfully ignore in order to enjoy it, and even then both of its sequels are far better games. It was amazing among its contemporaries at the time, but by today's standards it's a complete mess.  What's more, Earthbound is kind of a ""parallel sequel"" like Metal Gear Solid was to the original Metal Gear - nearly everything that's memorable about Mother is just done again, and better, in Earthbound.  Except the music. Game had damn good music."

earthbound,3dn5u8,chasmang,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"Ps mother 1 will ruin your experience with the series   I doubt it. EarthBound Beginnings is fun in its own right.  That said, starting with EarthBound, then Mother 3, and then EarthBound Beginnings is perfectly valid. EarthBound Beginnings is referenced very little in either of the two sequels, with only common enemies returning (some Mother 3 enemies are returning enemies from EarthBound Beginnings that skipped EarthBound!) so it can be set aside with nothing impacting the other two games' stories.  Now, this doesn't mean playing them in release order isn't valid either. You can see the progress made in each iteration and can appreciate the changes that were made (for better or worse). This is also the order that some Japanese players may have played the series in."
earthbound,3dn5u8,nohimn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think you should just do whatever you feel like man. I got EarthBound a while ago and loved it. I recently got Beginnings and played it. It annoyed me but I still loved it, it was an amazing experience. Personally I would have played Beginnings first if it was out at the time I got Earthbound. I probably would have liked it more if I didn't play EarthBound first. I think the right way to do things is in order. But hey, just do whatever you personally feel like."
earthbound,3dn5u8,Numel1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:00:21 2015 UTC,I think all people need to know is that they should play EarthBound before MOTHER 3. I actually recommend playing Beginnings between the two and wouldn't discourage people from trying it like OP. I'm not sure why someone would even recommend playing the game then claim it will ruin the series for people.
earthbound,3dn5u8,Ninjagamer1234,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:51 2015 UTC,I agree with everything except that M1 ruins your experience with the series. What a completely stupid statement. It's a great game in its own right.

Suddenly losing your most powerful PSI user, possibly losing useful items like the Franklin Badge, and getting charged by Mystical Records and burned by Coffee all in a narrow gauntlet makes for a short but difficult dungeon.  I doubt you're very under leveled. If you still have the Franklin Badge, give it to Jeff. Go all out with your offense (even using bombs and rockets with Jeff if you need) against the enemies and try to avoid as many as you can. They move in a distinctive sliding pattern, and the ones at the very end can consistently be outmaneuvered. Try to keep Jeff alive as his items can be really effective against the boss."

It should also be mentioned that while Earthbound is technically a sequel the stories don't connect really, there are a few things that carry over but generally you can play Earthbound without knowing anything about Beginnings. Same goes for Mother 3 in regards to Earthbound for that matter.  I'd say start with Earthbound, then if you really enjoyed it try Beginnings."

I'm so hyped for it lol I want to make more Mother songs with the EarthBound Soundfont but it's hard figuring out what instruments you want to make it with, especially since there's so many of them lol I actually REALLY enjoyed Mother 1 and it's still hard for me to decide which of the three is truly my favorite.

earthbound,3de694,sanchom,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:05 2015 UTC,I guess you could beat the game at a very low level if you keep using save states! The lowest level I've ever beaten Titanic Ant is level 8. Good accomplishment!
earthbound,3de694,Ness6464,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The guides I've read said that once you're past Titanic Ant, it's possible to do low-level without relying on save states. Looking forward to that :) They suggested just levelling up a bit to get past Titanic Ant, but I wanted to see how much of a long shot it would be to actually beat Titanic Ant without the Special PSI attack. Given how many times I had to reload, I can confirm that it's quite the long shot.  Another difficulty is that I had so little cash (due to not fighting) that I could only buy 6 hamburgers for the fight. PSI was needed for hypnotize, so it wasn't available for life-ups."
earthbound,3de694,kylezo,3,Wed Jul 15 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"With save states there's an RNG seed and past a certain point, you're always gonna see the same general behavior from the game, it's not based on your choices all the time, just locked in to a small list of possibilities. Not talking about crits and hypnosis, cuz like you pointed out you can exploit that. But the boss's behavior is limited at that point in the RNG process. This is why with extreme save state RNG abuse in say, Pokemon for example, you need to be 2 turns ahead of where you are aiming in a battle. If you save too close to the event, AI choices will be locked in and you can find yourself in a no-win scenario   As for bursts of steam, he always does it every other turn. You can just defend, attack, defend."
earthbound,3de694,cityofgarbage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"I found the lack of randomness in using save states too. I made a save state right near a Super Starman and was trying to reload each time he wasn't carrying a Sword of Kings, as I had read online that whether an enemy is holding an item or not is decided once they make contact with your characters. But after fighting him a few times, I realized everyone was doing the exact same damage points and getting criticals at the exact same times. I eventually just had to go back to searching around with no save states. Finally got it though!"
earthbound,3de694,chasmang,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"I beat the game a while back this way. Luck is needed against Frank and save states against Titanic Ant, but after that, the rest of the game is possible and somewhat easy to beat if you're familiar enough with the battle system.  Be sure to avoid all possible battles including some scripted ones. For example, you don't have to beat any of the Sharks in the arcade. Running away from the battle makes them disappear.  You can skip Everdred.  You can avoid the slime guarding Belch by luring a fly toward him and then running from the battle and using the invisibility frames.  You can avoid all the sentry robots in the Monotoli Building with a skip sandwich.  You CAN'T avoiding fighting at least one of the mummies in the museum. I tried so many ways short of slowing down frame to frame but couldn't make it out in time.  You can avoid all the krakens in the Sea of Eden.  It was a really fun challenge, but I wouldn't recommend trying it on anything but an emulator. I kept waiting for the boss that would force me to level up, but they never came!"

earthbound,3dbee5,xxharmxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. That's what I would recommend. EB is tied to Mother 3 and you'll get the most out of playing these two in a row.

Mother 1 / EB Beginnings is fine for what it is, but if it's your first game in the series, it'll push you away due to honestly not aging as well.

I finished Earthbound Beginnings last night, the second time I beat it, and was planning to begin my second run through of EarthBound today. As I was about to get started I learn of this news... maybe later.  He'll be missed."

earthbound,3d8at1,Kipst3r,12,Tue Jul 14 07:59:00 2015 UTC,Probably because they knew they could make extra profit off it with how much people clamored for it.
earthbound,3d8at1,XenoBound,8,Tue Jul 14 08:22:45 2015 UTC,"Potentially it was for licensing issues. When Mother 2 first was released in the U.S. licensing and sampling within music was still being sorted out much less in games.    Well the soundtrack liberally makes use of several songs from famous artists.  We are talking, the Beatles Chuck Berry, the Who and more.  Were this done today, quiet honestly it couldn't happen toda, legally it just wouldn't fly. So that  added cost could be towards legal fees involved.   However Trinen told Kotaku in '13 that licensing was not a known issue and that NoA effectively sad the light to push this game to the masses. It seems plausible that the extra 2$ is going towards a nest egg for any potential lawsuit, as well as gouging our collective nostalgia.  Also perhaps NoA is trying to recoup losses from its first launch."
earthbound,3d8at1,pdthorn,9,Tue Jul 14 08:48:24 2015 UTC,Mostly just cuz it's better and hence totally worth a higher price.
earthbound,3d8at1,kylezo,2,Tue Jul 14 11:21:31 2015 UTC,Do bear in mind that they lost a bit of money when it first came out due to failed marketing. Maybe they're trying to make it up?
earthbound,3d8at1,rockincellist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to bet that it costs slightly more because they figured out that it would sell no matter what, and they were right. EarthBound and EarthBound Beginnings are always on the best sellers chart."

Someone who genuinely enjoyed what he did. Someone who put in all that work to give us an enjoyable experience in the games we grew up with.  I have huge respect for this man for who he is and what he's managed to accomplish. Such a shame he had to go so soon.  R.I.P. Satoru Iwata.

earthbound,3d4y3n,scratchcatmeow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend: Play Beginnings first, but not to completion. Beginnings is a very arduous game, but the opening to the game will set the tone for the whole series. If you happen to find it completely tolerable, then by all means finish it. I still haven't really found the motivation to do so myself.  Next, play Earthbound, and play it all the way through. Same with Mother 3. Once you're done, you can go back and finish Beginnings if you are still looking for more to do.  I love the series, Mother 3 is my all time favorite game, but Beginnings simply isn't a masterpiece. I really don't want to suggest getting a ROM when the game just came out for us in America... but... You probably will give up on it like most people unless you really like archaic RPG's."

I can't help but feel a weight in my chest, knowing the world is emptier for his passing. I can hardly appreciate all the hard work he's done for gamers everywhere.

Definitely keep your money in the ATM, because ATM money is safe, but if you die with money in pocket, it halves which can do a hit to your hard-earned savings. Money is made of course by fighting enemies so it's in your best interest to beat as many as you can, and continue to rest up at the hotel. If you're really in trouble, you might need to backtrack to northern Onett or the area surrounding surrounding Twoson and fight some easy enemies there to regain some money, then once you've gotten enough to get Paula and Jeff from the hospital, fight those enemies to level them up, and return to threed once you think you're strong enough to die at a rate that's rare enough not to re-initiate your current issue. :) Best of luck!

There is one in the area leading to Saturn valley, after you get rid of the zombie guards. As for money, you really just gotta find a couple easy fights (no good flys for instance) and avoid the trash can monsters. Ness will be able to take those guys out. Then when you have enough money, revive the team. When you can fill up your PP, just use Ness's PSI to kill everything to level up Jeff and Paula, then proceed toward Saturn valley and use the magic butterfly. Once you get into Belch's factory, you'll be able to level up on Fobbies till the cows come home :)"

earthbound,3ct9ky,Rickyplayer6,4,Fri Jul 10 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like 'oversight' is even a bit of overstatement. The English translation team for Earthbound took a lot of creative liberties with the translation. For English speakers like you or myself it would seem like a continuity issue to betray the game as we played it. Unfortunately our English version is the less 'cannon' version. Plus it's been two decades, thoughts change. That 'Earthbound 2' reference was a bit of a joke, and I doubt anyone at Hal or Nintendo linger on it too much. Originally Mother 3 was going to have the English title Earthbound 64, so I don't think anyone is concerned with keeping in line with a line of loosely translated NPC dialogue that the player could miss."

However, the next game was called Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts. When they put that line in EarthBound, it was just a tease, much like Banjo-Tooie's tease. Hate to say it but it's not confirming the name EarthBound 2, and I don't think it will be anyway. It's hard to believe that it would go from a series with subtitles to define each game and switch to a number. Not only that but it was the number 2, it is the 3rd game."
earthbound,3ct9ky,cvillemade,-5,Mon Jul 13 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.  Calling it EarthBound 2 makes it sound like it's a direct follow-up to EarthBound, and the two games only have one character in common.   You can disagree by downvote all you want, but it's the truth."
earthbound,3ct9ky,Ultimate_Chimera,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Isn't the same issue present in Mother 3 and Mother 2? In fact, the implications are stronger by linking it to both Mother 1 and 2 with the title Mother 3."
earthbound,3ct9ky,chasmang,3,Fri Jul 10 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"It definitely works in Japan, since the sign in the Japanese version says essentially the same thing.  The only thing is, of course, Japan did get Mother 3, and calling it Mother 3 in Japan would (in my opinion) be less confusing since Mother 2 established numerical seriation.    Since we now have EarthBound Beginnings (rather than Zero), affixing a number to the title of a North American release of Mother 3 would likely confuse new players, as well as being out of place with the other non-numerical titles."

earthbound,3ct9ky,arlonarvesu,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"From a story standpoint, the games have almost nothing to do with each other.  The series is already not numbered sequentially outside of Japan, now that we know EarthBound Zero as EarthBound Beginnings.  Having one of the games in the series with a number attached to it would be out of place."
earthbound,3ct9ky,SALMONerd117,0,Fri Jul 10 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"Again, the lack of a connection doesn't really matter. The connection between EarthBound and EarthBound Beginnings is tenuous at best (basically the name of the villain and subtitle outside the game itself implying they're the same being) but none of that stopped Nintendo from naming them the way they did. And anyone remotely familiar with RPGs is most likely aware of Final Fantasy and the fact that they have just as little connecting them together despite being numbered sequentially.  People aren't so ignorant that they won't be able to understand what's going on just because the game isn't a direct continuation of the plot despite the number attached to the title. They'll figure it out. ;cp"

earthbound,3ct9ky,8melodies,0,Sat Jul 11 04:47:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's a horrid title, but the actual truth is that it was a working (read: not final) subtitle for EB64 which got canned a zillion years ago, and that's why you see it mentioned - some people still cling to that as if it has some sort of relevance. IMO Porky's Revenge or Return is a much better name."

Smash Bros 64/Melee: ""Ness? Mr. Saturn? Ohh, from the game with the big box! I should try it sometime."" Promptly forget.  Brawl: ""Lucas? Ohh from the same series! This seems popular, maybe I should check eBay and--TOOMUCH""  Wii U VC: ""This is great for people who missed out, when I get a Wii U I should try it!"" No Wii U till this year.  A few weeks ago: ""I need to use my Club Nintendo coins, and Earthbound is an option...""  Now, in midst of game: ""AGH WHY DID I NEVER GET THE BIG BOX AT BLOCKBUSTER""  Tl;dr - Took way too long to get around to it and I blame my younger self because it's been amazing so far."

earthbound,3cszdm,IXF,4,Sat Jul 11 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"Oh God, I am old.  I saw the hype in Nintendo Power back in the day and it consumed me. I WAS the target audience for all of those ""this game is like living in your gym socks"" advertisements, because I was a child of the Ren & Stimpy generation and totally thought gross humor was the best. I specifically remember saving up my report card money to buy the game on release day, as I had assumed EVERYONE would be running out the door to buy this apparently amazing and hilarious game.  (Hey, I was right... eventually...)  Anyway, I fell in love with the game, and it has been a source of joy and comfort in the two decades since its release. I am so glad to see so many people playing it post-Smash! I worried for a long time that the game would fade into total obscurity once the SNES disappeared, but Smash really saved it."

Melee introduced me to a lot of video game characters, including Ness, so he was no different from the rest. I distinctly remember enjoying learning about the characters from their trophies. When Brawl came out, and when it also introduced me to Lucas, I started looking up videos of EarthBound, then wanting to play it myself until I realized the price of the cartridge and SNES. Now, I'm an avid Mother fan."

I not only played Mario, but a whole bunch of other games - including Earthbound! Well, sorta. See, the intro scene with the ""War against Giygas"" thing kinda scared me as a kid. I thought it was a scary game, so I didn't bother to play it. Fast forward to 2013, and I bought into the hype of Earthbound on the VC, so I bought it.

earthbound,3cu29p,sharknado-enoughsaid,7,Fri Jul 10 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"You should really play EarthBound first, although the order in which you play them isn't going to kill your experience or anything. I'd recommend EB -> Mother 3-> Mother 1, or EB -> Mother 1 -> Mother 3. Starting off with Mother 1 isn't wise because a lot of things about the game will push you away if that's your first game."

earthbound,3ctyai,SuperRitz,2,Fri Jul 10 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend EB -> Mother 1 -> Mother 3, or EB -> Mother 3 -> Mother 1. Despite being the first game, Mother 1 isn't very accessible due to the game aging, and it'll likely push you away from the series if it's your first game. EarthBound is really the best for starting off, since it's easy to get acquainted with and gives you a great taste of the Mother series. Mother 3 is really the best game in the series, but you shouldn't play it first because of that reason. You'll be left unimpressed with the other games by playing M3 first."
earthbound,3ctyai,AwkwardPSI,2,Sat Jul 11 15:35:05 2015 UTC,I say EB - M3 - EBB is the best order to the series in.
earthbound,3ctyai,8melodies,4,Sat Jul 11 19:05:49 2015 UTC,"I recommend playing it in the order we originally did in the West: EarthBound, Beginnings, MOTHER 3.  Whatever you do, definitely play EarthBound before MOTHER 3. But I feel that to truly get the experience we did, you'll want to give yourself some kind of break between them which is the perfect time to play Beginnings. It's closer to EarthBound than MOTHER 3. It can be a bit difficult and not quite as accessible though very impressive for such a simple game, but when you finish, you can move onto MOTHER 3 which is such a huge jump visually, emotionally, and pace-wise. Hopefully, you'll be able to see why we love the series so much."

earthbound,3cqxih,rottedzombie,3,Fri Jul 10 05:58:21 2015 UTC,"I felt the build-up was all over the place. Flint's barely in the game, the Hummingbird Egg means basically nothing, I spend a chunk of time caring about Salsa before he becomes completely irrelevant...there's so many gears to this game and they just kept shifting.  Sure, the later half of the game builds up to this moment, but everyone saw the reveal coming (honestly, for how obvious they made it, I'm pretty sure they wanted you to know all along), and the big surprise was just the ending to the battle. I felt, like during the whole game, it just felt overly dramatic and too on-the-nose.  And then the ending happens that leaves the player questioning again. It's a good game, but it's certainly a messy game."

earthbound,3cqxih,pinkdratini,3,Fri Jul 10 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't cry, but I did enjoy it.  IMO the most emotionally raw part of the game was Flint's immediate reaction to his wife's death.

earthbound,3cqxih,Kcori,2,Fri Jul 10 07:24:06 2015 UTC,"even though I already had the mask man's identity spoiled to me the ending made me sob. the fact that the moment claus remembered his mother and regained his humanity was right as he was dying in his brothers arms made me just lose it. just remembering the flash back of flint and hinawa naming the twins is making me tear up. earthbound had me sobbing at the end partly because I felt that childish feeling where you tear up because you finished a game you loved so much and wanted it to not stop, (had that experience with chicken little on GBA as a kid and with ocarina of time recently) but mostly because of how tragic it was to me how all of ness' friends had to leave. the ending sequence where ness drops off paula while the world is peaceful and returns to his family was so beautiful. but with mother 3 I was hurting, it was probably the saddest ending ive ever experienced and it was executed so well, and I feel real bad for lucas. hes the most relatable mother character to me because of him losing a parent early on in life and him feeling weak and sad, and I can just resonate with him the most. but after the needle is pulled... I think lucas is back with his family... theres no way duster and kumatora arent like his aunt and uncle now, but I'm digressing"
earthbound,3cqxih,Silverpie,2,Fri Jul 10 09:14:05 2015 UTC,"I did, and I don't cry often. It's such a well crafted emotional ending ;_;  The only other thing that made me cry that much is Lost's finale, which is interesting because it shares some key things in common with Mother 3's ending.  LOST SPOILERS (pls watch the show first. it's good)  Itoi said in an interview that he watched Lost and he compared it to Tanetane Island, saying that the two share the same ""flavor"". Though of course, Lost's finale wasn't until 2010 and Mother 3 came out in 2006."

I teared up during the Earthbound ending.  Mother 3, however, left me a sobbing, snotty mess.  The Masked Man's identity is obvious from the moment he shows up but that doesn't make that ending any less of a punch in the gut.

I assume it has Ness's face on it because it's trying to warn Giygas about him.

It's a Gameboy Advance game, which are currently only emulated on Wii U aside from 10 specific Ambassador games that aren't for sale.

Some of them are the system's must-haves, but others are a little bit odd (like Super Circuit when MK7 had just come out, and Amazing Mirror even though multiplayer is impossible.)  Incidentally, if you have two of them on your 3DS, that means you also have the Ambassador certificate and can definitely download the other eight games as well as the 10 free NES games. I'd look into that."

earthbound,3cqt15,enragedmanatee,8,Fri Jul 10 05:17:22 2015 UTC,It would essentially look the same as on GBA. That's not how HD works.

earthbound,3cqt15,Sheeeeepyy,2,Fri Jul 10 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"It's not bad. I bought it day one and I play it in spurts. There are some things I wish Nintendo would have done differently, like splitting the ranked game modes. I get the idea of rotating the maps and game modes in and out, but I REALLY love one of the ranked modes and really dislike the other. Also, which we could just have a map rotation like cod. Those are my only gripes.   Downside for you, finding the Splatoon amiibo will be hard. They add fun challenges to the short single player experience.   For $60, it's up to you. If you want a fun and fast paced shooter, yes buy it. If that's not you, I wouldn't."
earthbound,3cqt15,disturbedfan65,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:50:20 2015 UTC,Alright. I might buy it then. I'm actually not huge on amiibo (except that Lucas one) so I don't really care about the Splatoon ones. It seems fun anough.

Disabling your A moves. B moves are fine. Just puts you to sleep. Leaning towards this one    Down B- Buy a T-Rex bat - The telephone gets raised and slammed down. Any dollars on the floor get burned, making a PK-fire-like hitbox, but for a significantly shorter time.  F-smash - Long ranged smash attack that launches the phone via the coil and retracts back. There's some endlag when the phone back latches on   D-smash - Phone base slams the phone on the ground, creating a shockwave. Kinda like PM Wario's D-smash  U-smash - Same as fsmash just vertically.

earthbound,3cekts,Kipst3r,2,Tue Jul 7 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"I'm still skeptical of Mother 3 coming out in America, honestly. I know that this year the release of EarthBound Beginnings was tied to a Mother Series Anniversary, but Nintendo, and Itoi, have skipped over a lot of anniversaries in the past. I'm not sure an anniversary is enough.   Also, Mother 3 just breaks soooo many rules about what kind of games, specifically first part titles, Nintendo of America will release. Without going into huge detail, NoA does not allow explicit references to death to be in any first party releases. I'll let you think that one over.   It's certainly not impossible for Mother 3 to come out. I hope it happens in the way you've outlined here. I guess I'm just a jaded Mother fan who's afraid to get his hopes up.   As for Mato's translation. He has offered it to Nintendo for absolute free usage, but he has also said that he thinks there is a 1% chance of them using it. It would be amazing if Nintendo hired Mato as a consultant of sorts to help with their own inhouse translation, though."
earthbound,3cekts,WheresGeno,2,Tue Jul 7 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"I always assumed they could just slap a T rating on the game and bring it here. I mean, in Japan it has the ""all-ages"" rating."

earthbound,3cekts,WheresGeno,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"I would have to read up on whether or not Xenoblade counts as a first party developed game, because that whole process gets confusing for me. For example, with the Smash Bros scene, if Nintendo is partnered with an event, commentators cannot say that a character has died. It must say KO. This is also why, for example, recent Zelda games have really been clear that villains are being sealed and not killed (even though Zelda has always been this way)."

Those are two different things.  Basically, a lot of whiny kids wanted a Chrono Trigger level detail on every single RPG, and they never thought that sometimes getting the most out of the graphic hardware might be detrimental to the aesthetics of a game. Could you imagine how ugly would Earthbound look if the artist would make every single sprite and tile as detailed as it is in Chrono Trigger?   I mean, CT is a great game, but it had a specific art style made to be used in full power with what the SNES could produce graphics wise. It just doesn't work for everything."

earthbound,3ca3v7,GwenCS,3,Mon Jul 6 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the higher quality graphics would have taken up more room on the cart, and they were already using a 24 megabit cart, 8 megs of which were already filled by the music. If they were to have done higher quality graphics they would have had to either cut down on the music, skimp out on some other area (possibly cut out entire areas of the game), or use an even bigger cartride, ignoring the fact that 24 megs was already fucking huge at the time (even though it equates to 3 megabytes, and not that many games were bigger; Chrono Trigger at 32 comes to mind, as well as Star Ocean and Tales of Phantasia which are the only ones released at 48).  When you consider how much there is on the cart that would have to be sacrificed for higher quality graphics, the decision to use the now classic art style was by far the better option."
earthbound,3ca3v7,wetterdew,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"No.  I disagree.  I am usually one to distinguish between technical and artistic nitpicking.  But in Earthbound's case, there are valid complaints with its art.  For example, the pixel art in Earthbound is all outlined in black, which is not pulled off successfully like it is in games like Yoshi's Island.  In Mother 3, they improved their art style so that edges tend to be darker colored, but not black, and it looks much better.  There are also some messed up perspective in Earthbound, but it could possibly be argued that it's part of Earthbound's charm to have confusing perspectives, though I think that's a stretch.  I still like Earthbound's art style, but I don't pretend it doesn't have problems that some people might very validly dislike."
earthbound,3ca3v7,ActionGamemaster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"That's a very fair point, but do you think any of the people complaining about its art style back in the 90s even thought about that? No, all those people ever say is ""it's too simple"".  But I do agree, Earthbound's anything isn't a perfect, polished gem. It's a great flawed game."
earthbound,3ca3v7,wetterdew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"They might not have explicitly said it, but generally speaking, there are a lot of elements of a style that you don't consciously notice that still affect whether it looks good to you.  (For example, if a game has poor color decisions, a player might feel like a game looks really bland, but might be unable to tell exactly why)  sometimes people are able to tell that something doesn't look good but can't articulate why.  Generally I think Earthbound has a strong art style!  I think it definitely improved with Mother 3."

earthbound,3ca3v7,sadult,2,Mon Jul 6 08:58:00 2015 UTC,"Y'know, in my opinion, when you have a game confined to 16 bits and you try cramming a bunch of detail in, it doesn't look so hot. Ya catchin' my drift pal?   Really though, I think earthbound looks great. It's beautiful in it's simplicity. You don't need super detail to look super good!"
earthbound,3ca3v7,abstractdrawing,2,Mon Jul 6 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"Look at Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii. It uses very few polygons, and uses very blurry textures for landscapes. This causes many people to whine and turn to the next COD. However, the game has the best aesthetic I have ever seen. The only reason why there aren't many polygons is because of how giant the game world is. It's the same thing here - because of the grandeur of the world, things aren't as detailed. The aesthetic is amazing, but when you look at sprites, they use the same color a lot. For example, a patch of grass would be one shade of green, not five. There isn't much lighting or shading, either, but they still look good because of their design."

earthbound,3ce044,shadow85,2,Tue Jul 7 07:33:48 2015 UTC,No. You cant. Emulation has lag. On real hardware you can get 16-hit combos almost everytime.  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRO9P1bMCoA

Side B - PK Beam, does a beam that is similar to ROB's (eg, it charges the longer you wait to use it), and will eventually turn into PK Beam γ, where it does launch similar to rest. Down B -  Hypnosis, causes sleep, or confusion (stun) Up B - 4th-D slip, works sort of like mewtwo's recovery Final Smash - Asthma attack (brain cyclone), you start choking, and cause a brain cyclone cause you can't breathe, the other smashers are flung around and damaged by debris, you eventually get your inhaler and go back to normal."

earthbound,3c8pg3,hero_light,4,Wed Jul 8 16:43:08 2015 UTC,Ninten would most likely be another derivative of Ness (I did give him a moveset if anyone wants to see it). I get why he'd be chosen (would rep Mother 1) but there's more interesting choices available.

Functions similarly to Robin's Thunder in that it can be charged. From an uncharged PK Beam α to a fully charged PK Beam Ω.  Side B - Paralysis. A short ranged attack, but can stun the foe for a few seconds.  Down B - PSI-Block. It blocks any projectiles from harming Ninten for a short amount of time. Has a cool-off period.  Up B - 4th-D Slip. Teleports in a similar way to Sheik's Vanish."

Random encounters and grinding (like he mentioned in the video, but mentioned it like it was a positive aspect for some reason) all put a damper on the game that makes it less fun for me to play. Itoi-sama said himself that the team did not test Mt. Itoi's difficulty. Earthbound made a lot of improvements gameplay wise. In-battle background screens, the odometer-like HP gauge, autowin, surprise attacking by how you approach the enemy, actually displaying the enemy on the screen and a lot more are what make Earthbound's (what would have been traditional RPG-like if not for said features) gameplay a hell of a lot more enjoyable. Earthbound Beginnings lacks all of those features and is short of any real innovation gameplay wise except for a run button. Earthbound Beginnings, while still enjoyable and a great 8-bit JRPG by any standards and filled to the brim with great personality like other Mother games, still suffers from the lack of the features Earthbound set in place and did 1,000 times better."

earthbound,3c60q5,MotherFan,2,Sun Jul 5 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest themes of Earthbound is destiny. Ness's parents, and Paula's mother understood this (maybe even more so than Poo's father or Andonuts). From the early days of the chosen fours life, no doubt were they destined for greatness.  Earthbound also portrays elements from eastern philosophy, the most prominent Ying and Yang, good and evil. Different entities take up the embodiments of Ying and Yang. Ness and his friends aren't so prominent as being the champions of Ying from the start. After destroying the last evil from his soul (Mani Mani), Ness essentially becomes the Buddha or some shit (polar opposite to Giygas).  The video is well made but I hated watching it from how much I disagreed."

earthbound,3c0bkp,enragedmanatee,2,Fri Jul 3 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, PK Ground is basically a way to reward people who got overleveled by giving them a ""you win"" button against NKC and the penultimate boss. It's not that hard to beat the game without ever learning it, and I would honestly say that's probably the way it's intended to be played. Basically, you can either strat your way past those two bosses, or just grind and then PK Ground them to death.  Not getting it until the final battle just means you got an actual challenge at the end of the game. I'd say it's a happy mistake."

earthbound,3c02ci,VoodooPup,2,Fri Jul 3 15:31:01 2015 UTC,(I can see why the game came with an strategy guide now)   You can also look at what your moves do by going to 'Status' and then pressing 'A' on one of your party members.

earthbound,3bz2ag,Lelshetkidian,5,Fri Jul 3 08:48:33 2015 UTC,"Well first, I'd say grind money to buy those items because they're super helpful. Give all your items you'll use (pencil rockets, sprinting bombs, healing items) to Boney because Lucas will be occupied with PSI attacks.  In-battle, use PK Love with Lucas and sprinting bombs with Boney to get rid of his allies. Then, just repeatedly use PK Love and pencil rockets and he'll go down quickly. Of course, take a turn to heal with PK Lifeup and Boney's food items when necessary.  At your level, it won't be too hard to defeat him."
earthbound,3bz2ag,XenoBound,2,Fri Jul 3 09:19:44 2015 UTC,"If you have shield a, put it up. Use pk love until bass's friends are gone, then defense+ offense up yourself while saving pp for healing until you reach max offense up. Bash until he is dead. Remember, it is crucial to save pp for healing. Guarding is useful before you have max defense. As a side note, practice getting his heartbeat down"
earthbound,3bz2ag,Ness6464,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:56:41 2015 UTC,"Jealous Bass is probably the only really poorly-designed boss fight in the game, where I would argue that truly the only way to really beat him is by grinding or getting really lucky. I know it's very unappealing, but I would go get a few more levels before going back to this fight.  Usually, in Mother 3, the right strategy will help you beat a boss several levels before you were intended to be able to. This is sadly one of the big exceptions to that."

earthbound,3bxts2,dudebro117,3,Fri Jul 3 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Earthbound seems grindy at first but the grinding's actually pretty much all front-loaded, you have to take some time to get strong enough to beat the first two or three bosses and then as long as you aren't avoiding encounters or managing your resources poorly you'll be fine for the rest of the game.  That said, it's still pretty damn old-school. You'll die a lot and the penalty for a wipe is pretty hefty, so be sure to save frequently, and use save states before boss fights (assuming you're playing on an emulator or Wii U.)  When you get Multi Bottle Rockets, start saving those for bosses. You can essentially 1HKO most mid-late game bosses with them.   The most important skill to succeed in Earthbound is managing your PP. Once Paula joins, the battles change drastically as you'll no longer just be attacking and healing and the enemies become a lot stronger. Get Paula up to your level as quickly as you can, and learn when you should and shouldn't use PSI to end battles faster. PP is very difficult to restore until you're nearing the end of the game - don't be frivolous with it.  Keep in mind, above all, that both Mother 1 and Earthbound were deliberately made to be played with a guide. There are parts of both games where you essentially need a walkthrough to proceed, so don't be afraid to look one up when you get really stuck.  When you get to Mother 3, change your mentality. IMO it's the most well-balanced of the three gameplay-wise. Grinding is no longer the only answer to many of the obstacles early on or later, having the right strategy in-battle and mastering the rhythm battle inputs will bring you a long way. You'll also never need a walkthrough to get through Mother 3, unless you want to find some of the more obscure side content. I like Mother 1 and Earthbound a lot, but in my opinion Mother 3 stands above the rest as one of the few truly perfect games in existence. You will appreciate it more after playing Earthbound, though, so definitely save it for later."

earthbound,3bxts2,Jollyolroger_,2,Sat Jul 4 07:23:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for your input!  I think I'm going to hold off on Mother 1 until after Earthbound at least - I've never been very good at/patient with RPGs and I think it would be better if I appreciated the series before I went for that one.  I've played a little bit of Earthbound now (just beat Frank) and I'm extremely charmed.  It's interesting because some aspects of the game seem very of-their-time and other things still feel fresh and avant-garde.  And the writing is phenomenal....but I'm sure you all know that :P  But since I'm going in blind, I'm worried there might be permanently skippable items or quests I could accidentally miss out on - is there anything like that in these games?  I feel like old RPGs are big on those."

Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings were top sellers on the virtual console, and Lucas was added back into Smash 4 by popular demand. I've seen so many reviews/retrospectives on EB over the years, and they're overwhelmingly positive. Mother 3 has an amazing English translation (as well as several other languages). There's a Mother 4 fangame in the works (which I'm not that excited for, to be honest, but I'll totally play it when it's finished). The only big issue is an official English release of Mother 3.  What I'm getting at is: a large portion of Nintendo-brand gamers know about this series, and anyone that talks about it does so in a positive light. The Mother community has always felt like it was the underdog, being second-fiddle to the main Nintendo franchises. While this is still true, I don't think we should be feeling like it's unrecognized right now. We should be enjoying the recognition it's already received!"

earthbound,3br1hb,NickFalcon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:41:53 2015 UTC,That's interesting. What moves does auto-fight do against Ness's Nightmare?
earthbound,3br1hb,amanitus,2,Wed Jul 1 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"Auto-fight isn't based on your enemy but on your party's status. It prioritizes restoring HP and curing negative status effects. When there's no immediate threat to a party member, it defaults to the basic attack. So, you can only bash/shoot, LifeUp, and Heal with auto-fight. This works against Ness' Nightmare because you're one-on-one and can stem the loss of HP with LifeUp for as long as it takes him to run out of PP."
earthbound,3br1hb,chasmang,2,Wed Jul 1 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember, it just does normal attacks and heals. It seems to be the most efficient way as it attacks and heals much quicker then you can normally (and also you only have Ness, which also speeds it up.)   Also this only seems to work on Ness's Nightmare, not sure why :P"
earthbound,3br1hb,NickFalcon,10,Wed Jul 1 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, PSI Flash does not as much touch a select few enemys, and Ness's Nightmare happens to be one of them. If you saved in Magicant and aren't a save-state-only scrub (JK) you can reset and go back there to grind and stock up on magic pudding. If you're too lazy, just keep in mind that you do not need to use offensive PSI, and it should be saved for lifeups. Just patiently bash and you will be Kay-O in the long run. I won't spoil it, but after you beat Ness's nightmare, there will be a wonderful surprise. ""Don't be nervous, you can do it!""-Mother 4 FanGame team"

earthbound,3br1hb,Ness6464,2,Thu Jul 2 04:11:57 2015 UTC,"The battle against Ness' Nightmare is the ultimate display of what the rolling HP counter can do. You'll often hear that the best strategy is to use Auto-Fight. That's because all Auto-Fight can do is bash and heal. And since Ness is alone, you can bash away and stay alive with a simple LifeUp alpha no matter what the Nightmare throws at you until he runs out of PP because it takes so long for your HP to roll down."
earthbound,3br1hb,chasmang,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:51:09 2015 UTC,You may need to grind. Or save as much PP as you can to keep healed.
earthbound,3br1hb,funbob1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"While not conventionally possible via normal play, it is technically possible to get Ness' Nightmare to Emit a glorious light (PK Flash Omega) at himself, making him OHKO himself in the process.

earthbound,3bg0lu,Cheatscape,4,Sun Jun 28 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Woah there's a lot here. First off congrats on beating Mother 3! Glad you seemed to enjoy most of it.   ahem So your levels here, let's see.    Level 63 across every character.   That's around the level I hear most people hit the end with. I actually fought most everything on my way and hit the end in the low 50s (like 53/52/52/50) so the ending was actually pretty tough for me. I see you were using levels to gauge about where you are in the game.., but I mean everything was kinda building up to New Pork City. The Chapter Name ""All Good things..."" is from a famous quote ""All Good Things Must Come to an End"" and they've been setting you up to confront King Porky the whole game. I dunno, to me Chapter 8 was actually super drawn out (though in a pleasant way). By the time I caught up with King P, I was ready to throw down and end the game. But I did notice this..   But compared to Earthbound where I had reached the level cap with all the characters (Lv. 99) it seems so much lower.   Wow, man. That's some grinding right there. Everytime I finish EB I end up in the low 70s and I fight every encounter on my way to anywhere. Your 63s in Mother 3 would still be lower than this but it's a lot closer of a gap than the 99s you managed to hit in EB.    By comparison, in Mother 3 it felt like something they did just because they did it in EB. They ask you right at the beginning of the game what your name is and make a point that it should be forgotten that they had even asked for it. And the way they use it (after the ""THE END?"" screen) it wasn't impactful. It felt cute more than anything. It was nice that the characters reached out to me directly and let me know that the world wasn't completely destroyed, but it felt lacking.   The END? section wasn't just about the characters addressing you (though it is part of it). It's also about the doorknob. It had been passed around the whole game from character to character, and at the very end, they give it to you, the player. I feel that this point here was Mother 3's real angle in incorporating the player.   Also, I know you haven't played Mother 1 but all 3 games incorporated the player in some way. Mother 1's was probably the least impactful in hindsight though it was probably cool at the time. EB worked it into the final battle nicely. Mother 3 handed you the doorknob.   The final boss kinda was what it was. It was very different from Giygas, that's for sure. I personally liked the little touches like ""For some reason Lucas won't attack."" and how Flint and Hinawa jump in. I also think it's somewhat poignant that the series recurring item, the Franklin Badge, winds up playing such a significant role in the end. Edit: Looking at what has become of Claus is sort of where you take a look at the Mother series as a whole and just look back at the chain of events from even before the start of Mother 1 that all led up to where we are now. EB's is probably more memorable for me, but Mother 3 had a lot going for its ending too. Also Claus aside, the whole resolution with Porky leaves lots to be wondered about too. Was he really just playing around all this time? I mean he was a huge dick about a lot of things, but even though he impeded Ness's progress throughout EB, he's devoted a nice chunk of his world to Ness. Does he consider him his best friend despite whatever we think from our perspective as Ness? It kinda makes one want to play Mother 2 again and think about that.   Anyways, just some rambling thoughts about your thoughts. I just played Mother 3 recently too. It certainly was one hell of a ride."
earthbound,3bg0lu,Alinier,3,Sun Jun 28 22:39:09 2015 UTC,"Really awesome insight from both of you. I had a thought a few days ago and i haven't shared yet, but did porky's tower seem kind of rushed to you?   I believe it's that way because the different areas of the tower represent what the designers weren't able to finish. In the early years, they had some decent coverage of a swamp with the hippos, but it only ended up there at the tower. There also seemed to be a ness type character helping out lucas and claus.   The game was said to be cut a lot shorter than it ended up being. I think it was supposedly 13 chapters and took place over 10 years rather than just those 3-4.  Maybe its crazy, but this is a little believable, i think."
earthbound,3bg0lu,flintconfirmed,3,Mon Jun 29 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you there. I actually thought New Pork City as a whole felt a little flat and rushed. Mother 3's narrative may have been stronger presented as a whole, but I like the expansiveness of Earthbound's world more.  It's a shame that they might have had to cut content, but such is life."
earthbound,3bg0lu,jakeonaut,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:39:21 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by AFTER the (The End?). For me, nothing happened afterwards. :( It might be my emulator though, I wasn't able to save in-game the entire time, I just saved on the emulator."
earthbound,3bg0lu,gordonthecat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"When you get to ""The End?"" you can move around and talk to a lot of people. You should check it out either in a save, or look up a video."

For a little while you'll be able to use the ""The End?"" for a reference point but afterwards you'll have to stumble around for a bit."
earthbound,3bg0lu,Alinier,3,Tue Jun 30 02:45:18 2015 UTC,You should pay Mother 1. Terrific game to wrap up the series because of its difficulty. I think it is just as good as the other 2 games.
earthbound,3bg0lu,Ness6464,2,Sun Jun 28 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on the fact that Mother 3 had better story overall, but EB's ending was better than Mother 3's.  When I was finishing EB, I very nearly died multiple times. Mother 3's ending wasn't as challenging imo.  However, I still get stuck whenever I'm asked which I like better, because they're both just so good!"
earthbound,3bg0lu,Geffro,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure if Mother 3's ending was incredibly easy, or if I just did enough grinding to make it a cakewalk.  I ended up in the low 80s and did the grinding to get all of the rare stuff for everyone (Friend's Yo-Yo, Mystical Stick/Gloves/Shoes,Thud Charm, Awesome Cloak, etc.)."
earthbound,3bg0lu,Meta4X,2,Mon Jun 29 12:35:38 2015 UTC,"I think Mother 3 is definitely the ""Better"" game from a design standpoint. Thats what happens with sequels most of the time. I think Earthbound hits people harder because its realistic and closer to our lived experiences."
earthbound,3bg0lu,pkjamming,2,Tue Jun 30 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Earthbound comes off as more...""avant-garde"" to me. It's less traditional and structured, and the gameplay can vary from captivating and strategic to monotinous, long stretches of Auto Battling and walking.   But it's also more humorous in that it's consistently...weird, while still being in a relatable setting. We can relate to its environments more, even if we can't quite relate to the weird things going on (zombies, cavemen, barf monsters, etc.)   Mother 3 is more grounded, and has an explainable reason for the weirdness through the Pig Army and Chimera projects. The gameplay is more consistent in how fun it is even doing basic battles, and long stretches of walking or bus rides are shortened up greatly from Chapters. The story is less scattershot scenarios as you're on your way to the big baddy, but there's still a hidden layer of depth beneath the wackiness.   It almost reminds me of the comparison between No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle. NMH2 is the better, more structured game, but while the original is a little more frustrating and less polished than its sequel, it has a weird charm that can't be ignored and still makes it a great game, despite gameplay flaws."
earthbound,3bg0lu,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"I hate Mother 3, I can't get the attacks right and the music, while good, does not fit the game at all. The pacing and chapters with different characters blows too.  Im at that haunted house area with the limping middle aged southern guy btw"
earthbound,3bg0lu,homelessscootaloo,4,Mon Jun 29 04:00:47 2015 UTC,"Ya know, I actually had the same feeling with Mother 3 the first time I played it. You're in chapter two right now. After switching to Duster (that's the limp guys default name) I felt like all my work with Flint was gone because now I was back to a low level. But the game actually has a pretty nice difficulty curve (up until the end) regardless of being reset. And you're right, it sucks to switch characters after getting so invested in a character, but trust me, if you can make it to chapter 4, it'll be worth it. That's when the game really picks up.  And the reason you can't get the rhythm attacks right probably has to do with your emulator (assuming you're using one). Tiny bits of lag can throw the rhythm off so much that you just can't get the extra hits in. What my roommate does when he uses an emulator is he just puts in a cheat so that he always get's 9 hit combos out of the possible 16. That way he still gets some of the extra hits without getting overpowered. He's got a pretty good sense of rhythm anyways, so if he could actually run the game as intended he'd probably do even better than an average of 9. I'd recommend it if it means you get to experience the story.   And I really stress that you try to make it to chapter 4. A lot of people say chapters 2 and 3 are the most dry. The rest of the chapters make up for it."

The instrument on the middle-right is indeed a ukulele. It's a borrowed instrument so I'm not super familiar with it (or ukes in general). However, I do know that ukes shaped like that are known as ""pineapple ukuleles"". I guess they resonate a little more than regular sopranos. I've never recorded a regular one, so I can't compare the two shapes, but I did find that this one records really well."

But I recommend, instead of playing the original versions or even the GBA translation playing the 25th anniversary NES hack. It balances the game, but not in the ""oh my god this is toooo eaassyyyy"" way that the GBA did. All the graphics were replaced in a positive way, especially the enemies."
earthbound,3be29l,ActionGamemaster,5,Sun Jun 28 10:36:42 2015 UTC,Seconding the 25th anniversary hack for the NES. It's a fantastic translation and the kids don't have diamond heads.   Thank you for showing support and buying the game!

earthbound,3be29l,a_link_to_the_passed,2,Sun Jun 28 19:12:19 2015 UTC,It does
earthbound,3be29l,ActionGamemaster,8,Sun Jun 28 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"I will be buying the VC version   Then your only option is EarthBound Beginnings.   EBB is just EB0 on Virtual Console with a slightly less cool name.   Since you said you played Mother 3 I'm assuming you aren't 100% against emulation. With that said, the Mother 1+2 fan translation is considerably better than the one in EBB, so I would highly recommend that."
earthbound,3be29l,IronicTitanium,2,Sun Jun 28 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"There are four forms of the game available to play (at least that I know of).   Mother -- Famicom   Available hacks: 8 / Available fan translations: 0 Best hack: Mother 25th Anniversary -- This hack reworks the entire game from top to bottom. It uses Tomato's Mother 1+2 translated script, and all of the sprites have been reworked to fit more with the Earthbound visual style. Areas are reworked to be less frustrating, as well. The original version of the game. Available only in Japanese.  Earthbound Zero -- Nintendo Entertainment System   Available hacks: 0 / Available fan translations: 0 The leaked official English version of the game. Was never officially released. Certain sprites and situations are censored.  Mother 1+2 -- Game Boy Advance   Available hacks: 0 / Available fan translations: 2 Best fan translation: Mother 1+2 -- Translates Mother 1 using an altered, more faithful script. Includes an Easy Ring item that can be equipped to raise the amount of XP gained per battle and lowers the encounter rate, which makes the game too easy if you wear it for the entire game. Mother 2 is not translated. A compilation of the first two Mother games. Some of the sounds have been altered and some music has had instrument removals/changes, to compensate for the GBA's capabilities. Otherwise, it's basically just a portable compilation of the two games.  Earthbound Beginnings -- Wii U (VC)   Available hacks: 0 / Available fan translations: 0 The only version of the game officially available for purchase in English. Practically identical to Earthbound Zero.    I'd actually recommend playing Mother + the Mother 25th Anniversary hack. It offers the best experience, with many areas being more forgiving without sacrificing difficulty or faithfulness."

earthbound,3be29l,MotherFan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"The original translation/difficulty is perfectly fine, especially after turning the battle text speed all the way up to 5. The retranslation is more accurate, and interesting to check out, but be sure to buy the official release!"
earthbound,3be29l,vince94_1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"While the 25th anniversary rom hack is very fun and overall better to look at, you should still go with Earthbound Beginnings to support the series, especially because of Nintendo's recent comment about never saying never to MOTHER 3."
earthbound,3be29l,robinamiibo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Is there anyway to get the anniversary hack working a phone? I'd be able to play it anytime if I could figure it out!

There is a moderate level of grinding but I am a huge old school RPG fan that had not played this series prior expecting a portable version to eventually surface. When the made the announcement at the World Championships I bought it right away and haven't been able to put it down since. If you're worried about difficulty save states are available to help as well. While I haven't played any other versions, the WiiU VC version is highly recommended!"

HOWEVER, what I find most compelling about him as a villain is that ultimately, he is still a child. There are not many similar child villains in all of fiction (most compelling example I can think of is the girl in The Bad Seed, which I highly recommend). We see Mani Mani screwing over all these adults that ultimately escape or whatever, but Porkys parents, in EB at least, just enable him. And that bitch killed Buzz Buzz, fuck her. I wonder what Buzz Buzz was like as a non-bee."

earthbound,3bd9y6,Kipst3r,11,Sun Jun 28 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"That is a good point, and I think one that the series touches on very deeply.

Several times, other more influential people under Giygas' power saw the error of their ways after Ness defeated them but not Porky. He always chose to maintain his grudge against Ness and mess with power he couldn't possibly understand until it led him to ruin peoples lives."
earthbound,3bd9y6,Numel1,3,Sun Jun 28 10:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but all of them were broken from his power somehow. Mr. Carpainter was fought, the Mani-Mani was destroyed in Fourside. Not only was Porky completely unfought, but it's implied in the original MOTHER 2 that he was going to convert back to being a regular kid before Ness ignored him outside of Happy-Happy Village."
earthbound,3bd9y6,MotherFan,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ever explicitly stated, but my belief has always been that Porky was influenced by the Mani Mani (practically lived right on top of it) but clearly had the ability to resist is, at least more so than people like Carpainter and Monotoli. But even after the statue is destroyed, he continues to follow through with Giygas' plans and even tries to usurp him in the end. It seems to me that Porky was naturally evil and used the knowledge and guidance of Giygas to gain power more than Giygas used him.  Also, I'm not sure what you're referring to with Ness ignoring him outside Happy Happy Village. I always assumed he was just being the same old jerk he always way when he backs out of his offer right there. I don't think we were supposed to read Ness' silence as him ignoring him. Otherwise, Ness ignores literally every character in the game. :cp"

earthbound,3bdpaw,NostalgicNerd,2,Sun Jun 28 06:28:59 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to use a DCMC pamphlet then...I am a bit worried about it freezing near the end though since this game seems like a (worthy) time investment. Do you know of any reputable sellers?
earthbound,3bdpaw,TheDobber,2,Sun Jun 28 06:35:45 2015 UTC,"Happened to my Cartridge when Mother 3 is supposed to enter. I suppose it was probably linked to the fact that when the mechas entered, it was blank text, as well as ""Dance"" and ""Toughen Up"" freezing the game."

earthbound,3bdpaw,killer4u77,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:49:10 2015 UTC,"I believe it was flashed incorrectly -- this is due to the fact that using the moves ""Toughen Up"" or ""Dance"" will either cause the game to freeze, or rarely spit out garbage text.

More evidence toward being a UK spoof, as opposed to Canada.

Many may disagree, but that's okay. I am very sad, however, because my parents hate Video Games and I wouldn't be able to afford a Wii U or a copy of a Mother game if I could.I'm forced to emulate:(. If you are able to get a Wii U, you defiantly should so you can support the series and get other good games.

earthbound,3baaxt,vince94_1,2,Sat Jun 27 10:06:54 2015 UTC,"JUST for EBB alone? No, but maybe for EBB, EB, and another game like Smash.  Beginnings is sort of outdated, and is not as enjoyable as EB or M3. It has that distinct EarthBound charm, but it's more difficult and not as well balanced (lots of grinding necessary).  There are random encounters, which occur way too often (more so than Pokemon), and it doesn't have unique battle backgrounds like EB or M3. It doesn't have a lot of EB or M3's unique mechanics, like back-attacking and combos.  I will say that its music is amazing, and it's still fun to play just for that EarthBound feel. But it's your call. It's always great to support this series and perhaps help increase chances of getting Mother 3 localized."
earthbound,3baaxt,XenoBound,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:01:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who owned a WiiU before EBB was announced, and who subsequently bought and completed it, the game has aged beautifully. The simplicity of its graphics and environments, complexity of its battle and item system, and maze-like dungeons all add to its overwhelming charm. Its music is nostalgic and timeless, having been featured in multiple Mother games. This is all before mentioning its storyline and characters, both of which are genuine and captivating. I enjoyed EBB so much, I have already completed it a second and third time.  Whether or not you buy a WiiU depends on your available funds, but I can tell you this; if you buy a WiiU the first game you should purchase is EBB."

earthbound,3b4erc,Lone_Star_,-4,Fri Jun 26 07:02:07 2015 UTC,Ech... the 3D models in this video look so ugly
earthbound,3b4erc,PleasePleasePepper,5,Thu Jun 25 23:06:31 2015 UTC,I actually rather like the look. It's got that surreal 'imperfect' charm I feel Earthbound was all about.
earthbound,3b4erc,TheLimeyLemmon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"it's kinda like Earthbound, it wasn't good in terms of graphics for what was possible at the time"
earthbound,3b4erc,PleasePleasePepper,-1,Fri Jun 26 02:58:31 2015 UTC,But Earthbound is still visually appealing. This is ugly.
earthbound,3b5u7s,Ninjagamer1234,8,Fri Jun 26 05:25:08 2015 UTC,"That's insane... I dropped out of the ""hunt"" for a cartridge a few years ago when I bought just the cart for $150 on eBay, so I'm not sure what a complete set goes for now a days. I recall it being about $500 in fair condition complete around that time though. I would say hold off on that deal, just feels way too steep..  BONUS Story Rather than investing in a complete earthbound big box when I finally wanted to try and buy it, I actually got a complete copy of Mother 2 from Japan, the American earthbound cart, a Japanese super famicom, swapped the boards of the carts and BAM I had a complete Mother 2 in English, playing on a snazzy Japanese Super Famicom.  Because let's face it, the Super Famicom looks way cooler then the NA Super Nintendo.. At least in my opinion.  And I spent roughly $260-270 on all of that.. Still half the price if I got the Earthbound Big Box.. Haha. Just thought I would share the story."
earthbound,3b5u7s,Existavail,4,Fri Jun 26 05:41:43 2015 UTC,Jeez might as well just play it on Wii U for that price.
earthbound,3b5u7s,heavyxfriends,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:05:44 2015 UTC,I already have the game on an emulator and stuffs.
earthbound,3b5u7s,homestar92,2,Fri Jun 26 18:18:57 2015 UTC,I got a complete big box set for under 100 a couple years ago... Someone failed to do their research before selling their old games...
earthbound,3b5u7s,homestar92,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:52:02 2015 UTC,I go to every garage sale I see hoping that someone has it for like 10$
earthbound,3b5u7s,Amauriel,2,Fri Jun 26 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Mine was $70. Which is weird to me. That's way too high for someone who's completely clueless. So they knew enough to know it was worth more than a typical SNES game, but not enough to know that they could have asked for like 7 or 8 times that price."
earthbound,3b5u7s,Red-Blue-,2,Fri Jun 26 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"My local game trade store just put out a copy, cart only, with $285 on it.  I'm so glad I got Earthbound when it first came out."
earthbound,3b5u7s,AnBearX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"That's a bad deal imo, unless you're in canada."
earthbound,3b5u7s,grumpnotso,2,Fri Jun 26 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"That price is actually down from what a sealed big box would have costed. Last I saw one, it was around 1k."
earthbound,3b5u7s,SC2_Bench,2,Fri Jun 26 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, god. You unlucky person. I spent $330 on the game, then added $50 for the box.."
earthbound,3b41ja,Mitch_Plz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Woah this is crazy cool! Do you think you can do a version with a red background? Like the Japanese Mother title screens? Great work!
earthbound,3b41ja,TheOswaldo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah.  I lost the original files, so I'll have to start from scratch haha."
earthbound,3b41ja,TheOswaldo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Oh man if that's the case, no worries. Still impressive work!"
earthbound,3b41ja,bluebaron,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"I found it, but I'm actually making a similar rendition of the Japanese Mother title, haha, your inspirational!"
