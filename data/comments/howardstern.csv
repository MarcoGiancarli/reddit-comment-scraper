howardstern,3e2oes,urboro,0,Tue Jul 21 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"He didn't fire them, Sirius did."
howardstern,3e2oes,aTOMic8,7,Tue Jul 21 17:56:07 2015 UTC,They weren't employed by Sirius.
howardstern,3e2oes,newyork89,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"But the department was funded by Sirius as part of the contract. Once they decided to cut the funding, they were basically fired."
howardstern,3e2oes,Stingertap,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I think it's more likely HTV had an expensive set-up, some cheap company pitched entirely new camera-set-ups, reduced staff, digital photography, and upon HTV ending Howard brought in a new, tiny crew."
howardstern,3e2oes,newyork89,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"HowardTV is run by InDemand. InDemand leased (at a great rate) studio space from Sirius for the control and production room that was onsite. Most of the work was actually done off-site at InDemands studios in Manhattan.  So when HowardTV didn't generate the necessary profit and provide the desired services (independent internet streaming), both Howard Stern Productions and InDemand had to close down shop with the show.   Who was at fault? InDemand primarily. The weird ass agreement they had with cable providers did not allow them to keep up with the industry/market and offer HowardTV as a stand-alone streaming service. The subscriber count dwindled and the money wasn't there."
howardstern,3e2oes,vektorblake,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"It could be that a new company took over production but they have a non-compete agreement with InDemand, which employed all those guys. howardTV was let go late last year? It could be that they have to wait a year to release anything new."
howardstern,3e2oes,aTOMic8,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, I doubt it will be called HowardTV, but it's interesting that they're going through all this trouble for not currently having video services available."
howardstern,3e2oes,TeegSOA,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Doubt they will run it under HowardTV, but I don't see why they couldn't. Howard could have easily bought the trademark to the name and such after Sirius got rid of the team."
howardstern,3e2oes,onesillyoldman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's pretty weird that they would be still recording the show but maybe it'll be available backlogged? Shouldnt we have heard something about Whalerock by now?"
howardstern,3e2oes,LegitIAmjack,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"My theory: Once he announces his signing 5 more years with Sirius, part of that same deal will be the launch of a new video service of some kind. Might even have videos of the last year backlogged. Only a wild guess, but I have a hunch a new contract would include an updated subscriber-growth incentive (since the one that caused the lawsuits clearly went to shit), so he's holding off on that new video service for the new year to use it as a spike on his new growth incentive.  I'm probably way, way off here. Only conjecture. Maybe they're just working out the kinks."
howardstern,3e2oes,sonoma12,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:34 2015 UTC,"If they're getting close to launch, they'll do test shows. All of the transmission equipment, production workflow, etc. needs to get worked out before they launch.  HowardTV (and TV in general) is super expensive to produce. Howard/crew knows that he's got to do this on a (relative) budget, so things have to be really efficient before they launch.  It's got to be efficient for 2 reasons. #1 - The amount of subscribers will be relatively low compared with radio. #2 - In order to make money and still offer the product at a price that people will pay vs. torrent/steal, it's got to be cheap.  Now that Whalerock cuts out the middle man, they've all ready got a big leg up on efficiency. Now they just need to optimize production and distribution, and they'll have a pretty sweet business model."
howardstern,3e2oes,sonoma12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"K Rock and his syndicate studios gave howard shit for even mentioning ""eh EH eh"" (sirius) back when he was getting ready to move over from terrestrial and howard loved sticking it to em. Sounds like maybe Howard is being more respectful to Sirius if he is going to leave, leaving the announcement for closer to the end of his contract to delay the inevitable exodus of sirius subscribers to follow him.  edit: also there's also the possibility he'll stay broadcasting  his show's audio on Sirius, and provide video & archives through whalerock website."

From most buildings in midtown you wouldn't be able to see downtown, unless you happened to be very high up in a building that was significantly taller than the surrounding buildings.  (and of course he was in a studio so there's no windows in any event)"
howardstern,3e33qd,xaa933,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was just in NYC a few weeks ago, and you really can't see anything from Midtown unless, like you said, you are in a building that is much higher than the surrounding buildings. I went down to the new Freedom Tower, but it wasn't until we were pretty much on top of it that we could actually see it."
howardstern,3e33qd,sink620,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah. I didn't think there were windows in the studio, just thought they might have sent someone out in the street or up on the roof if it were possible. But that would make sense that too many buildings were in the way."
howardstern,3e33qd,Revere12,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"It's about 4 miles from midtown to the World Trade Center.   In midtown Manhattan, you can't see the horizon. You're surrounded by skyscrapers. And the Avenues are not absolutely straight from north to south so it's not like you can just look down the street.  Sometimes, if you stand in just the right spot, you can look down an Avenue between buildings and see One World Trade but not everywhere.   Even if you're on a high floor of a building, you can't necessarily see much other than the buildings directly across the street.   Anyway, the KROCK studio did not have a window. I remember when David Lee Roth was coming in, he demanded a window in the studio and Howard made fun of him for it."
howardstern,3e33qd,8976r7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:06 2015 UTC,their building is in manhattan and they were close to the world trade center. but there are no windows in the studio. they might have been able to see them from some other windows in the building if those windows were facing the right direction and not blocked by buildings.

I recall one story where he was trying to go to the bathroom and people were waiting around outside for him.  As out of touch as I feel Howard is today I still think he's fairly down to earth when it comes to stuff like meeting fans. He doesn't love it but he puts up with it and will at least acknowledge people and be polite to them. He's not the kind of guy to be rude to someone's face anyways.

I don't remember if the caller was Chris from Floral Park though.  We've got to find this guy!  Who the fuck would make calls like that?  I wonder if he's a family man or some deranged psycho.

I respect people saying she's annoying or arrogant, that's fair, but the people who said she's just really lucky are deluded.  She cares so much about the show she worked while she had a grapefruit sized tumor.  We should all be so lucky to have someone believe in us and support us the way she does with Howard."

He doesn't want to discuss it because he is very sensitive to any legal matters.  He is a radio broadcasting rebel, but only within the confines and parameters established by attorneys.

howardstern,3dy4uk,africanlivedit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:55 2015 UTC,"If true that may explain why it's gotten so far. Howard probably saw it as a shakedown. The plaintiff probably just wants to be paid and doesn't care who does it. So he filed against Howard too even though I imagine the case is weaker against him. He figured the negative press which eventually may happen might trigger Howard to resolve it because he's got deeper pockets. It was almost a half million dollar remodel job and he's asking for a tiny amount that wasn't paid. Still if I was in Howard's shoes I wouldn't pay the guy either, it sounds more like it was the other contractors responsibly ultimately."

More fun to listen to, as it is now, was the dysfunction that occurred in several markets. Some of the time, Howard would pick up on a caller who was calling from a new market that had gone live that week, and no one had any idea that there was a new market coming on. Or, they would have a rogue program director who would chop up the show and would have to be dealt with by the ""C.I.A-holes,"" out-of-market listeners who were deputized to listen to their stations and report any irregularities to the broadcast.  Even more was to realize just how staggeringly popular Howard Stern was in New York. A great example that you likely heard from the HoHS was the episode with the guy who was going to jump from the bridge. When they didn't believe that the caller was on the bridge, they asked other motorists on the bridge to honk their horns, and quite a few people started honking. If a particularly funny segment was airing, and you were stuck in traffic, you could look over to other cars and see those drivers laughing as hard as were."

""DeBella is the talent and Stern is the no-talent,"" Del Colliano says flatly. ""DeBella is a comedian. Stern is just a guy who can say words that other people don't readily say on the radio. He's the Morton Downey of radio. Morton Downey's only talent is to chain-smoke cigarettes on TV and not develop lung cancer. He's disgusting.  ""Listening to Stern is like watching an X-rated movie. After you watch it for 10 minutes and you've seen enough T-and-A, it gets boring. John DeBella does not have to say every disgusting thing that passes through his mind to be funny.  WMMR's biggest problem is whether DeBella is going to continue to work there. I'm sorry, folks. You're just not gonna grow another one of him. When he goes, they're dead.""

One time, they had on Burton Cummings (from the Guess Who) as a guest. Cummings made a joke and then made a reference to Howard Stern. They hit the dump button immediately and their producer was whisper yelling ""Nooooooooo!"" During the commercial break, Brian semi-lectured Burton Cummings about ""mentioning the name of our nemesis on the air."" It was very uncomfortable to watch. Mark and Brian were nice guys and they thought their niceness would win the day, but they really had no chance. I think Howard was number one in one ratings book period."

It was awesome because he came in and clearly wanted to win L.A. And he did."
howardstern,3du4kk,metrofeed,11,Sun Jul 19 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"I started listening in the mid to late 80's when Howard came to Krock.  I was born in '81 but my father was/is a huge stern fan and it was always on in his car or at the house.  It was definitely a cultural phenomenon, and I got swept up in it.  Howard was always very vocal about his perceived persecutions, and it rallied all the stern fans together.  It was great to be a stern fan.  Howard was the ultimate underdog and who doesn't love rooting for the underdog?  It's much much different now but I still enjoy the show (mostly the interviews.)  I went a 3-4 year period without listening to howard when he moved to sirius until my father got tired of having no one to discuss the show with and bought me a sirius package.  I'll always remember using the show as my primary newsource during the OJ trials, and the attacks on Sept 11."

I know some things probably bothered Eric's family but ultimately you are right, it gave him so much joy. They may just not want to be a part of that and left it to him to be ""his"" thing and not theirs as a family."

Since Don Buchwald is the agent of Fred and Robin, they will not sign until Howard's contract is complete.  Howard may be moving to something called ""Whalerock"".    Benny's vortex or schtick-coma became so chaotic that he was effectively banned from ever discussing his personal life, Alisa Jordana and his mic is turned off unless spoken to directly.  JD has a semi-live in girlfriend who is exposing him to the finer things in life, but JD is unable to order Chinese food at restaurant that isn't buffet style or has pictures of General Tsao's chicken on the wall.  Jeff the Drunk is convinced that Eric Ándre is a caller impersonating a non-cancerous lump on his back.  The Wrap-Up show was rebranded and retooled. Essentially it's now a 10 minute show hosted by Jon Hein and a random comedian/guest.  Sometimes the guests are better than Hein.  Since the hiring of Brent from Bubba's show there has been a reliance on a terrible pre-recorded ""interviews"" with piss poor impersonators.  Charlie Sheen calls in several times a week from 2011 to say ""winning"".  Jason Kaplan & JD allegedly routinely monitors this sub reddit for YouTube links...so please don't post or request.  RIP Todd Packer."

howardstern,3du1ya,VonBjeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:27 2015 UTC,Bobo (annoying caller) was banned from the show until mid-September   what was he banned for?  edit: I just searched youtube for a video of this and apparently O&A also have a caller named Bobo that they banned? wtf. never in my life have I met anyone named bobo. is this a common nickname or something?
howardstern,3du1ya,8976r7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"IIRC, his name is Bob Bowie."
howardstern,3du1ya,blokeski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Stern & Sirius staffers routinely monitor this sub.   YouTube links while fun to watch, unfortunately lead to the removal due to copyright infringement. TODD PACKER's YouTube collection was recently removed and was also posted almost daily to this subreddit.  Hanzi commented infrequently from this reddit account, which has now been disabled."

howardstern,3du1ya,VirgilHilts68,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:45 2015 UTC,did he really talk about Whalerock on air? Anyone have a link?
howardstern,3du1ya,asr05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:14 2015 UTC,I did not know Jeffs lump was Eric Andre. TIL. I was super impressed by how wity the lump was. I enjoyed thinking it was just some brilliant random caller.
howardstern,3du1ya,PurpleLeatherCouch,3,Mon Jul 20 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"No, Jeff is convinced the lump is Eric André. Eric has confirmed via Twitter that he is not the awesome lump."

howardstern,3du1ya,fedora_nice_guy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:57 2015 UTC,best show of the last year!
howardstern,3du1ya,bigdwb1024,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The fallout from the Bobo-banning over the plugs for General Hospital are just beginning.  RALPH is Bobbi's probation officer. This premise is potential Comedy Gold.  Bobo's paranoia has led him to believe that any contact via social media and sms text messaging will be monitored and reported to Ralph. Bobo also believed that recently his ss# and phone number were comprised as a former federal employee (mailman?) and that Egyptian Terrorist are calling his cell phone but handing up. ""Egypt"" appears as the incoming caller-ID."

howardstern,3du1ya,bigdwb1024,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:41 2015 UTC,I thinks that's a case of trying to capture lightning in a bottle again.  If there was a massive sting/test of all wackpackers from Beetlejuice -- Marianne from Brooklyn that would have been something. King of All Blacks would sell out the the show for a new iPhone.
