Rochester,3e2h3b,qwerty-qbert,6,Tue Jul 21 14:12:34 2015 UTC,That's it!  Thanks for the article!  I had a feeling it might have been a fountain.    Too bad it never worked. That would be a cool feature.
Rochester,3e2h3b,qwerty-qbert,8,Tue Jul 21 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"That would be a cool feature.   I agree. I don't think a 40' column of stinky river water blowing everywhere is the right direction.   We have 12 sister cities, so why not have an equal amount of smaller fountains to represent each one."
Rochester,3e2h3b,Rocmonkey,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, well good point."
Rochester,3e2h3b,XDOAYA,5,Tue Jul 21 14:48:33 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they didnt try this using the river head pressure from upstream?  But I guess silt  and debris would always be a problem.

Rochester,3e49s5,skaara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"Their mac salad has their mustard game on tight  Actually Dogtown excels in the side game. Live in Chicago now. Most plate places you're chasing the burgers/dogs/proteins. Dogtown, every bite, be it primarily mac salad. homefry, or burger, it's a good bite"
Rochester,3e49s5,cgjones1,-17,Wed Jul 22 04:04:04 2015 UTC,I see a lot of Dogtown fans here and it makes me think they are either really good or just reinforces my theory this sub is only low class hipsters with horrible tastes in everything whow dont hAve cars so only recomend places they can long board to.  I haven't tried them yet because I'm pretty sure the latter is the most likely option.
Rochester,3e49s5,IPbanned,3,Wed Jul 22 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"Dogtown can certainly turn into hipster central at times, but they do have a legitimately delicious garbage plate. The double fried home fries do it for me, and the hot sauce while not completely conventional is also very good. Dogtown had slowly replaced Mark's as number 1 in my heart for plates. I'd say the deserve at least one chance, you likely won't be disappointed."
Rochester,3e49s5,unclexbenny,4,Wed Jul 22 03:26:33 2015 UTC,It's the best because it's not greasy and the home fries are a perfect golden color and not soggy like most places.
Rochester,3e49s5,skaara,-3,Wed Jul 22 00:45:56 2015 UTC,Ask for the sauce dry and you avoid the inch of greece.  I used to like Marks on Monroe for late night plates.  Pro tip call in a take out order from the line then just snag a seat.
Rochester,3e49s5,IPbanned,6,Wed Jul 22 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"I love Charlie's plate out on Empire in Webster. Mayonnaise-y mac salad, crispy home fries, good size burgs, and a really generous application of a sweet/spicy hot meat sauce."
Rochester,3e49s5,Stumblin_McBumblin,2,Wed Jul 22 00:12:18 2015 UTC,Charlie's is truly the bomb.
Rochester,3e49s5,DickMcMuffin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:53 2015 UTC,I've tried probably 50 different places in Rochester and Charlie stands out among the best. Cobbs hill pizza used have a great garbage plate but it's been along time since I've been there.   A lot of people are saying dog town hots But I'm just not a fan.
Rochester,3e49s5,qwerty-qbert,4,Wed Jul 22 02:39:50 2015 UTC,I like Henrietta hots or Empire in Webster. The whole plate is ruined if the hot sauce sucks.
Rochester,3e49s5,currypotnoodle,4,Wed Jul 22 00:23:22 2015 UTC,Wimpys. Nothing spectacular but it satisfies the plate cravings.  A Bill Grays plate once in a while too. Their sauce has the unique sweet taste to it.
Rochester,3e49s5,bucky716,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"I love wimpys plates. Mostly because I can get as many sides as I want and they don't charge extra, so I don't have to pick between only 2 sides"

Rochester,3e49s5,DowntownBootyBrown,2,Wed Jul 22 00:56:49 2015 UTC,Decent is what I'd call it.  They go a bit overboard with the hot sauce.  Maybe because they only give you one cheeseburger.
Rochester,3e49s5,zoltans_of_swing,2,Wed Jul 22 02:02:56 2015 UTC,"I get it. Totally understand your criticism. I'm a white hot plate guy, so they give me two dogs as usual. And I really, really like my plate spicy, so I don't mind the sauce."

Call me old fashioned, but I think they have always done it right and will continue to do so. There's a reason they are packed every night."
Rochester,3e49s5,inflightandflames,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:32:08 2015 UTC,"My best friend lives in Atlanta and whenever he comes up, he usually is on a flight that will arrive around 11:30-midnight, and the first thing we will do is get a plate from Steve T's. There is nothing like walking past the on-sight, armed security guard to order your plate and load up on cups of ketchup and Frank's. That grill probably hasn't been cleaned since the place opened, and it just adds that extra layer of flavor that you can't find at many other places.  In terms of the plate itself, the homefries are perfectly fried and then left in a pile on the corner of the grill to keep warm. The patties and hots are legit, and they use a brown mustard which (IMO) is the only mustard that should be on a garbage plate. The meat sauce is the right combination of slight spiciness and greasiness. And maybe most underrated, the bread they serve along with your plate has always been good."
Rochester,3e49s5,OpabiniaGlasses,0,Wed Jul 22 05:07:30 2015 UTC,Cash only. That makes it real tough for me to go there.  I also find it intimidating to order.

Rochester,3e49s5,CaptainHedgehog,2,Wed Jul 22 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"Hear me out on this.  I have been to all of the notable hots places around Rochester, searching for the best place. I will not content on the homefries because it is the easiest thing about the plates.  It never makes the plate great, but had the power to completly destroy it.   I will only comment on the cheese burg Mac home fry everything combo.    Yes Dogtown is good.  The standout ingredient to me is the meat sauce.  Very flavorful not too much heat but just enough. Mac salad was slightly above average in taste.  Definitely worth a trip to try.  Like everyone is saying.   Empire Hots is also very good.  They have just the right amount of grease that combines very well with the Mac salad.  Overall very good and easy to shovel down while not getting too tired of the flavors.  I will say the consistency isn't always there.   Not a fan of the Charlies plates.  I know I'll get hate for this but the meat sauce is just too damn hot.  To much spice and 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through,  I just can't stomach anymore even though the hunger is there.  Very over powering.   I feel like I have to mention Tahou's just because.  Every experience has been very meh. Almost to much grease and the Mac salad was just ok.   The portions were probably the smallest out of anywhere.  It's OK for a quick lunch but sadly thats about it.   The consistently best plate,  in my opinion,  is from Vicari's in Ontario.  It is worth the drive.  By far the best burger I've ever had.  They are thick with something of a spice or seasoning that compliments it very very well.  Apparently they make the burgers by hand and put them on the char. Not many places use the char.  Mac salad is spot on.  Meat sauce is also very flavorful with just the right amount of heat for shoveling down a plate.    Also if you have the munchies very late at night when everywhere else has closed,  save your palette from the disaster that is Mark Texas hots.  Some love then. My burgers were always too dry,  Mac salad tasted a little funky and it was just not great.  Still a plate but eww.   If I didn't mention somewhere they probably had shitty home fries. Originally haven't heard of it, which is unlikely."
Rochester,3e49s5,WhatDoYouCrave,3,Wed Jul 22 03:00:18 2015 UTC,I like Fairport Hots. Huge portions and a really good (spicy) sauce.  Been meaning to try Dogtown but haven't yet. Seems like Reddit really likes them.
Rochester,3e49s5,xtrexjpsouz,3,Tue Jul 21 23:00:02 2015 UTC,Jimmy Z's. Getting real home fries and not the deep fried squares is fantastic.
Rochester,3e49s5,Addonexus89,2,Wed Jul 22 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"""The real Jimmy z"" is a douche and everything is way to overpriced an honestly vary odd tasting. This is coming from someone who has eatin there since they opened and have family that still work there to this day. You might know him as the fry master. But Jimmy z and his father will tell you, they came to Rochester from Greece, the country or wherever the hell they call it. seen the profits and opened up a plate location in a college town that literally rakes in all the business from the drunk mass of students. It works for them an I suppose that's all it rly takes. W/e"
Rochester,3e49s5,old-tobie,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:22 2015 UTC,"I can't really speak to what Jimmy or his father are like as I never worked for them. From my customer experience they've always been friendly. Their garbage plates prices are actually on par or cheaper than others in the area. Cheaper than P hots, Greece hots, and Fairport Hots. I do agree that their plates definitely taste different from others in the area but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I can't really blame them for seeing a prime opportunity to open a hots place and jumping on it though."
Rochester,3e49s5,Addonexus89,3,Wed Jul 22 02:32:47 2015 UTC,NOT Bill Gray's! Their meat sauce is really weird.
Rochester,3e49s5,kevan,2,Wed Jul 22 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"Truth! I really like Bill Gray's and go there once a month or so for their fish fry and burgers, but the meat sauce is way off for some reason. The first time I got it, it was like a solid lump on top with gravy dripping around the side. I didn't get it."
Rochester,3e49s5,Temporarily__Alone,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:23:59 2015 UTC,It's also spicier than most others but it seemed like they made it spicy for heat but not for flavor...if you get what I'm saying.
Rochester,3e49s5,kevan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:42 2015 UTC,Charlie's Plate kicks ass for burger joint plate. Maa's Diner in Webster is great for more of a diner quality plate (LOVE their hotsauce.) And The Gate House at Village Gate has an interesting and somewhat fancy spin on the whole thing. Overall for me? The classic burger joint style from Charlie's all the time.   I've taken folks from out of town to try a variety of plates and their garbage plate virginity palettes all generally agreed with these places too!

I don't often go to Henrietta but when I do, I like to eat at Pickle Nick's subs or Sticky Lips BBQ (depending on my mood and price range); but, there's just about everything else if subs or bbq aren't up your alley.  As for playgrounds, I'm not so sure (again, not in that area all that often) but I'm positive that there's got to be one somewhere nearby. Maybe a park in the vicinity?"
Rochester,3e5lyd,bnielsen96,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:00:13 2015 UTC,I90 goes just south of Henrietta   This is dumb nitpicking but I believe it goes through Henrietta
Rochester,3e5lyd,kevan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"There's two Rochester exits that are in more populated areas.  One is I-390/Henrietta.  Veterans Memorial Park in Henrietta has a decent sized playground.  As /u/bnielsen96 mentions Henrietta has a lot of food options, any national/local chain you can think of, most are along Jefferson Road.  The other Rochester exit is I-490/Route 96/Victor.  There's a mall there and a lot of restaurants around the mall, head north on 96 to drive by them.  I guess Powder Mills Park would be the closest with a playground off that exit.  I haven't personally seen it but I found this post where someone talks about it.  Both areas it's not uncommon for families with kids to be around.  Henrietta is a little more college-kid-focused when school is in season but around this time it's more locals, families with kids.  There is a third exit that's labeled Rochester... I-490/LeRoy.  Honestly wouldn't suggest this one, the area is a little sparse nearby and you'd have to drive a fair bit to get restaurants/parks."
Rochester,3e5lyd,madmarigold,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:43 2015 UTC,"There is a Chuck E Cheese on Hylan Drive which is pretty much right off the thruway.   Red Robin on Jefferson, while it doesn't have a playground or anything, is family friendly.   Veterans Memorial Park (again, off of Hylan) has a playground (I believe) if you want to grab some picnic food and go there or split your off thruway time between a restaurant and there.   I don't know how far or long off the thruway you want to come, but its 15-20 minutes of highway to downtown and you could visit the Strong Museum of Play. Fun for the kids (and you) and a Rochester classic."
Rochester,3e5lyd,ComicBookNerd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"Others have mentioned Henrietta and while it will most likely serve your needs, please note that Henrietta is really just a huge series of plazas and strip malls. Tons of convenience, definitely some great places to eat but no soul at all. There's probably 20 national chain restaurants and maybe 10 or more local restaurants, Target/WalMart, Home Depot/Lowes, Dick's Sporting Goods/Field and Stream, Best Buy/Staples and 2 major grocery stores, Tops and Wegmans. There's also Marketplace mall with everything that comes with a large mall. I don't go to Henrietta unless I need to get stuff done.   The Victor exit is actually half way between the mall to the west and the village to the east, oth right on 96. So you could get the convenience of the mall and the charm and character of the village of Victor. The village does have a couple of nice places to eat and the kids could play at any of the parks there, and you could probably even take them to the school which is right near the village. There are a couple hotels between the mall and the village.   Rochester is weird in that we have 3 major malls, all three of which are as big or bigger than the one mall that most cities 3 times our size has.  I'd personally recommend Victor as it will be nicer on the eye and you can avoid the endless choices of Henrietta. Good luck!"

The general feeling of the staff was that it wasn't going to last long, but I don't think anyone anticipated that it would happen so suddenly. Staff had obviously formed personal relationship with many of the members so certain people were warned of the state of things with the hope that word would spread, unfortunately once the bottom fell out completely it was too sudden to tell everyone. The staff was staying almost exclusively because of loyalty to the members, but sadly, loyalty doesn't pay bills.

Rochester,3e0rn9,IPbanned,9,Tue Jul 21 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"This stereotypical depiction was ubiquitous at the time. If you remove any artwork that adhered to those conventions, you remove nearly every period artwork depicting black people.  The struggle here is that the exaggerated features of the stereotypical depiction were used to great effect toward racist ends (e.g., minstrel shows). But that doesn't mean every such depiction was, by association, racist.  Or does it? Plenty of Confederate soldiers fought for their state and way of life, but regardless of their personal feelings toward black people, their cause ultimately was racist.  This is not an easy question to resolve and you have to give kudos to anyone who acknowledges that."

I never had more than basic exams/cleaning.  FWIW, I have got a crown that I'm starting to use as a temporary test case ever since I had an Aspen Dental dentist barely save me from a pushy desk-worker who was trying to tell me I needed it replaced immediately. (It doesn't need replaced yet, 6 years later; it has a minor, purely cosmetic issue that isn't visible during any natural smile.) My WNYDG dentists never pushed for a replacement - I got the sense that they were always happy to explain issues and my options honestly and clearly.  I haven't been there in a year because I moved out of state.  Hope that's helpful, and that you get someone with more relevant and recent experience.  Edit: For clarity, I went to Aspen first, then WYNDG at my next cleaning, and returned there until I left the area."

Typically cavities have been $50 or less, root canals are usually roughly around ~$100 unless it's been like 3 roots like in a molar where it's a little bit more, and post/crown can run as much as $350 - $400 depending Overall I've found it extremely reasonable compared to private practices"

They have a significant turnover problem with hygenists, every 6 months we had someone new because they just don't stick around.  Some were really nice and did a great job, some were borderline insulting and were crazy rough/painful and some were just pushy like they were selling used cars.  I don't know if that is typical of the industry but it always bothered me that the good ones NEVER stuck around for even 6 months (felt to me like it was reflective of work environment) .. but that was my experience.  We've since switched to a smaller dentist (they're small enough the dentist does the cleanings ) and includes the former pediatric dentist from the Southtown plaza WNYDG practice."

Rochester,3dvy7m,liquidh20,-5,Mon Jul 20 00:08:05 2015 UTC,LOL.
Rochester,3dvy7m,IPbanned,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"You say LOL, but I filed an FCC complaint after I got tired of them throttling my connection to death and daily outages, and once I got my response, my issues mostly cleared up. I strongly recommend everyone file complaints against this awful company. They're gearing up for a merger with Charter, and FCC complaints complicate that, so they seem to be taking them pretty seriously."
Rochester,3dvy7m,TeamLittleFinger,3,Mon Jul 20 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"Seems like you worked with the techs quite a bit, but you didn't go into too much detail about troubleshooting your stuff. A few things that might help -   1) are you using a router / WiFi point that's attached to your cable modem? And if so, have you ruled it out as the problem?   2) do you have more than 1 computer /laptop / phone that's trying to use the internet, but can't when it goes down? (As opposed to only the computer, so you wouldn't know if it's the computer or the modem since there isn't a second device to confirm it's the modem.)  Not saying it isn't their problem, but routers can be notoriously obnoxious with random connectivity issues. I've also seen brand new computers, laptops etc that have driver issues causing WiFi to randomly fail for a while.  Anyway, aside from more troubleshooting, I'd flat out ask them to cancel the service and give you a refund. Sooner the better if you're going to do it.   If they refuse to refund, there's not much you probably want to bother with doing. You can file a complaints, but it won't do anything, especially over 1 month of service. Fighting them won't be worth the time and effort for you, and certainly not the legal costs."
Rochester,3dvy7m,Kungfutrip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:40:22 2015 UTC,Have a few devices that all go out at the same time.  We use a wireless extender but tech support claims it wouldn't be that. Is there something they could be missing?   Also thanks for replying
Rochester,3dvy7m,Kungfutrip,2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:45 2015 UTC,"OK good, multiple devices rules out a lot of issues. Your problem absolutely could be something with the WiFi though.  Try plugging your computer / laptop directly to the cable modem using a network cable. (There should be one or more network ports on the back of the modem.) If you can, I'd also turn off WiFi on whatever device you're plugging in to really make sure it's getting internet over the wire.  Next time everything goes down, if the wired device still has internet then you'll know it's a problem with the WiFi. Otherwise it is very likely the modem or their line.  Let me know if that doesn't make sense."
Rochester,3dvy7m,Muppetz3,3,Mon Jul 20 10:33:57 2015 UTC,"You can login to the modem when the connection drops and see if the cable signal is down, or if you try to login to the modem and it does not respond it is a bad modem.    If it is a all in one modem/router sometimes they have issues with some wifi devices, I know mine from TW would crash all day long, it did not seem to like when the phones would connect, I replaced the router with my own and no issues."
Rochester,3dvy7m,misanthropyFTW,2,Mon Jul 20 13:15:26 2015 UTC,"If it is a problem on their end and not yours (make sure it's not your WiFi!), then call billing and explain how often your service has been down and that you shouldn't have to pay for time that the service was unavailable due to their technical issues. See if someone on that end can light a fire under tech support to actually fix the problem."

Most bars will put the game on for you because there usually aren't that many people out and about that early (even the 1230 games). I know one of the bartenders at Magpie is a Liverpool fan who always has the games on.

Rochester,3dpv90,TheFecalJesus,5,Sat Jul 18 07:48:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully people will do this as a normal action soon. Its amazing how often this happens and people are surprised that their stuff gets taken.
Rochester,3dpv90,StuBeck,4,Sat Jul 18 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"I keep mine locked and I go through the whole song and dance of making sure no valuables are visible, but I hate that I need too.  I don't know why so many people in Rochester think that a car and its contents should belong to anyone who walks by it. I really wish this city wasn't so accepting of theft.  EDIT: grammar"
Rochester,3dpv90,odds_arrgh,5,Sat Jul 18 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"It's not like this is a Rochester-specific problem. Sure, maybe you can get away with it if you live in a hick town in the Midwest, but it amazes me when I go places where people don't lock their car or home doors. It's such a basic precaution. Even if I lived in the middle of the woods, I'd still lock my doors."
Rochester,3dpv90,TeamLittleFinger,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"I've been to cities (mostly Canadian) in which people don't lock their doors. I'm always envious.  Rochester is the only city I've seen so far in which citizens insist the city is safe and crime rates are overblown, yet claims it's the fault of people who act improperly when crime occurs. Rochester insists that it's a safe city as long as you lock your doors, lock your car, hide your valuables, and aren't out after dark in 3/4 of the city. If you fail to do any of the following than its your fault and you deserve what happened to you."

It only takes 30 seconds to break into a car and steal something.   This is not unique problem for Rochester, Texas and California for example account for 1/3 of stolen vehicles.

Thats why I lock my car, but at some point we have to come to the understanding that if we've told someone something 90 times in the last 100 days, and they don't do it, that we can't be surprised that it happened. It still sucks, but we can't be surprised by it."
Rochester,3dpv90,StuBeck,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"Why should I be told to lock my car? Why can't we say ""taking items that don't belong to you is bad""?  I'm sick of the hypocrisy of this subreddit. /r/rochester gets up in arms if anyone suggests that crime actually occurs within city limits, but then when crime does occur it's because the crime victim didn't act appropriately, not because anything is wrong with the city."
Rochester,3dpv90,odds_arrgh,3,Sat Jul 18 18:02:56 2015 UTC,I never said taking items that don't belong to you isn't bad. I'm sorry that you are continuing to misunderstand what I'm saying.
Rochester,3dpv90,StuBeck,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"I understand you just fine. You're saying that if someone doesn't lock their car, then the car and the stuff in it are up for grabs.

Rochester,3dpv90,odds_arrgh,3,Sun Jul 19 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying that at all. I'm not sure why when I keep on saying I'm NOT saying that that you insist that I am saying that."
Rochester,3dpv90,StuBeck,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:43 2015 UTC,The way I'm reading your posts is that you're saying people who don't lock their cars deserve to have their things stolen.
Rochester,3dpv90,odds_arrgh,3,Sun Jul 19 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"No, I never said that, nor did I imply it. I'm saying people should lock their cars so they don't get their stuff stolen. Does this make more sense?"
Rochester,3dpv90,StuBeck,3,Sun Jul 19 01:30:07 2015 UTC,On another note sometimes it can be beneficial to just take everything out of your car and leave it unlocked. It might save you a window.
Rochester,3dpv90,r1y23,2,Sat Jul 18 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't advise this. I used to think the same way, until someone tried to steal my car by smashing the steering column open with a rock.

Rochester,3doq9k,jwill602,7,Sat Jul 18 00:48:39 2015 UTC,"They could in theory save you money. Maybe scam isn't the right word for it, but the way they ask for your RG&E bill and basically try to trick you into signing up with them, especially people that just don't know any better, is ridiculously shady. I listened to their whole speech last time they came by, they were trying to convince me that my energy supply charge would magically disappear if I switched to them, which is a lie. I'd just get another bill for it from someone else for it."
Rochester,3doq9k,unclexbenny,5,Sat Jul 18 03:14:54 2015 UTC,Multilevel marketing companies (pyramid scheme) tend to resell telecom and other services including energy. Odds are a third party provider is this.

They don't say ""I'm from Energy Supplier X, and I think you should switch to us.""  They at least imply that they're from RG&E.  They avoid telling you the name of the company they represent.  They talk about you being due a refund on your bill, but avoid telling you that you're switching suppliers to get it."

For a full list and information on how to pick a supplier, see this page  This page has natural gas suppliers and this page has electricity suppliers  edit: Definitely read up on this since alternate suppliers can be more expensive, depending on your usage.

Boy was I wrong! I seem to recall that my December bill was over $600, possibly more that that but I'm trying to be conservative and not exaggerate.   When I called the company on this they told me their costs were competitive and that RGE costs would be just as high or higher. I confronted them on RGE'S rates that I was quoted from an RGE rep earlier in the day and the person I was speaking to indicated that RGE wad either wrong or that RGE's rates would be going up higher than the alternate supplier soon.  I quit and had to work on paying off about $900 in bulls from the 3-4 months I was with the other supplier. I would strongly recommend against going with one of these groups and if they insist upon you that you could be saving 10% or more, just tell then that you'll take your chances or ask for real comparative rate data.

Well basically he supposedly used them and then they were investigated for their citizenship or something and lost pretty much their entire involvement including any chance at ownership in the restaurant. Long story short, owner exploits Mexican couple and fucks them over in the end.  I have absolutely no idea how true any of this is but that's the story I heard."
Rochester,3dn1pz,kevan,3,Fri Jul 17 18:30:07 2015 UTC,That's one version of it. Another is that he partnered with them because they made amazing food and said they were in the country legally. When he found out they weren't he did what he had to do to protect his livelihood because they were breaking the law.  No clue which one is more accurate.
Rochester,3dn1pz,ParkAveMoonface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"What I never understood about this whole story is that Lyjha is a landlord... I don't know about you, but whenever I've rented an apartment from someone, I had to provide all sorts of personal information to the landlord; driver's license, SS card, references, proof of employment, bank statements, etc.  Then they'll run my credit and possibly do a criminal background check if they're paranoid.  Even though I have stellar income, perfect credit, and an immaculate record, I get put though the ringer as if it is not.  That said, it's hard for me to believe that he first let them rent the space at the Public Market without having SOME idea of their legal status.  Later, when he entered a business with them at La Casa, he rented them an entire house; part of which served as their living quarters.  Wouldn't there be some kind of paperwork, or personal documentation, background check to go along with it?  Why enter a business without verifying who you are going in with?  I just feel like there is too much of the story that is missing here, why would this situation be any different than his most basic rental?  Did Maria and Omar present Lyjha with forged documents, or did he just forget to do his homework and get burned in the process?  Alternatively, did he know from the beginning and throw them under the bus when it blew up in his face?"

I wasn't aware he rented that to them. I'd think the Public Market did.  I lived in and around Park Ave for over 12 years and never had more than a credit check and/or to show my paystub. I've never had a background check, criminal record check or been asked for references. I've also rented places without giving any more than my driver's license. I rented from someone I knew for years beforehand, and she didn't ask for anything, I just signed the lease. We don't know the context and if there was any sort of pre-existing relationship.  While I have no clue what actually happened, in this scenario if they were illegal, said they weren't he didn't ""do his homework"", they would still be waaayyy more at fault then him.

My family was there last week; seated at 6:30PM, and it took another 20 minutes before the server came back to take the order.  Then it took about an hour for the entrees to arrive.  As my family waited, the server apologized several times and dropped off more chips, salsa and ""queso on the house!""... ugh.

Rochester,3dldqz,Ilmara,2,Fri Jul 17 05:23:22 2015 UTC,"D&C article: http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/07/16/rochester-wall-therapy-street-art-murals-return-erich-lehman-ian-wilson/30273509/  Tianna Brooks couldn't decide what to make of the massive mural that covers the front of a former church at South Clinton Avenue and Meigs Street.  Completed earlier this month, its centerpiece is a female figure that's one part Hindu icon, one part pin-up girl. It's a bit creepy, said Brooks, 18, a city resident who works as a home health aide, but it might also be cool.  ""This would be an amazing tattoo,"" she murmured, gazing up at the building as she waited for a bus.  Her final judgment: ""I think anything that makes the city beautiful is perfect.""  That's the kind of reaction that WALL\THERAPY organizers hope to provoke with public art — a gentle jolt that prompts conversation, emotion or inspiration.  ""It gets people to take a pause, to look and think about their environment,"" said Erich Lehman, co-curator and lead organizer for WALL\THERAPY, a citywide street mural campaign that has become an annual affair.  ""They're talking and they're having conversations that they wouldn't normally have.""  WALL\THERAPY 2015 kicks off Friday with an exhibition at Lehman's 1975 Gallery, showcasing artists who will work across the city for 10 days. This will be a more focused effort than other recent years, featuring fewer murals, but introducing a new partnership with artists abroad.  The mural on South Clinton — the future home of a bar and arcade called The Playhouse/Swillburger — is the work of Netherlands-based artist Handiedan, who pasted up her artwork early due to a scheduling conflict.  The art project began on a smaller scale in 2010, though it wasn't called WALL\THERAPY until 2011. Dr. Ian Wilson, a University of Rochester Medical Center radiologist, founded it in part with hopes of bringing inspiration to youths in challenged neighborhoods.  The project swelled to more than 30 artists in 2013 and two dozen last year. This year's event, funded partly by a successful $35,000 Indiegogo fundraiser, features 14 artists. Organizers expect to add about a dozen murals to more than 100 that already transformed blank walls across Rochester.  Urban Nation, a Berlin-based organization that hopes to open the world's first museum dedicated to street art, selected half this year's WALL\THERAPY roster. In return, WALL\THERAPY plans to curate a show in Berlin for Rochester-area artists.  The two groups struck up a partnership when Urban Nation director Yasha Young came to Rochester to visit another Berlin artist who was working here — perhaps a sign of the city's growing reputation as a canvas for street murals.  Visitors this summer include returning New York City graffiti artist Daze and such far-flung talents as Sweden's Andreas Englund, Switzerland's NEVERCREW and Brazil's Eder Muniz.  Four artists are from the Rochester area: Nate Hodge, Matt Roberts, Joe Guy and Brittany Williams. Hodge, a Brockport native, plans to paint a wall off Atlantic Avenue on a theme of buildings and villages perched on clouds. He's produced large works before, but not one as high-profile as this.  ""It makes you a little bit nervous, almost, but I feel like those nerves leading into it are good,"" Hodge said. ""They make sure you're bringing the absolute best you can bring to it.""  This year's theme is the surreal and the fantastic — concepts that clearly already were at play in past murals like the three-eyed sea creature staring out from the side of Sun Fish Market.  Lehman said organizers want to protect artists' freedom to provoke thought, but they also don't want to offend residents who have to look at paintings daily. Organizers sometimes talk to neighborhood groups — though a community meeting for every painting would be difficult — and they work closely with building owners to secure permission, he said.  ""It's a leap of faith and trust that we take very seriously,"" Lehman said. ""We also understand — and this is the beauty and curse of art — you can't please everyone.""  Daniel Morgenstern owns a St. Paul Street building where a 2012 mural of sleeping bears drew some criticism. But he said he likes that this painting and five others on his properties still generate conversation today.  ""I would do 10 more murals if I could,"" he said.  Murals in the neighborhood surrounding the Rochester Public Market helped to add a ""wow factor"" to the residents' own beautification efforts, said Judy Douglas, a member of a community group called the Marketview Heights Collective Action Project.  ""I think they add a lot to the community as far as showing pride,"" Douglas said.  The artwork is sometimes, by nature, temporary.  One 2011 mural, for example, was painted over as part of renovations to a wall. Street artists for the most part are satisfied as long as they get a photo of the final product, Lehman said.  ""They understand the ephemeral nature of art in the public sphere,"" he said.  Other products are less tangible. Local artists learn new skills and build relationships with out-of-town painters, Lehman said.  But at its core, the goal is still to inspire inner city youths. Interactions with budding artists show that the project has done that, he said.  ""If we inspire one kid to stick with it,"" Lehman said, ""then we've succeeded.""  DRILEY@DemocratandChronicle.com"

Rochester,3dldqz,KonKreete,2,Fri Jul 17 13:29:52 2015 UTC,"You would have to contact the artists individually for anything private/inside.  I do know quite a few places have been contacting local artists, like the place on Canterbury and Highland Hospital.  I'm sure if you contact Wall Therapy through their website they can give you contact info."

Rochester,3dldqz,KonKreete,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"Two or three years for any mural is amazing.  Other festivals and areas like the Bushwick Collective, the murals are only temporary before they are painted over in a year or so."

Rochester,3dm9zu,Combogalis,8,Fri Jul 17 12:35:59 2015 UTC,"Carmax and Auction Direct USA's entire model is predicated on ""no haggle"". That said, at that price range you won't find much if anything at those dealers.   Your best bet is to find a car you're interested in from a private party on Craigslist, have a mechanic do a pre purchase inspection (with the understanding that any 3-4k car will have issues), and buy it."

Rochester,3dm9zu,wsender,0,Fri Jul 17 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"That's more of a sketchy dealer and/or craigslist price range. Most reputable dealers bottom out at around $8k for a car,  since they don't like selling cars with rust, dents, age,  etc. Also fuck Spurr, don't buy from them."

Rochester,3dm9zu,nimajneb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:33 2015 UTC,I was commenting on how a lot of dealer cars have rust and they try pretty hard to cover it up in order to make that sell.
Rochester,3dm9zu,xzzz,0,Mon Jul 20 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"Most reputable dealers bottom out at around $8k   Most dealers that sell cars below that are trying to scam you out of money buy overpricing their shitty cars. Carmax, Auctiondirect, new car dealers, etc don't generally sell cars in their used lots with rust on them and they are actually selling reliable cars.  Have you ever shopped for cars in the different price brackets?"
Rochester,3dm9zu,nimajneb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of cars at ""reputable"" dealers like Dorschel and West Herr that have rust problems."

Rochester,3dm9zu,nimajneb,0,Mon Jul 20 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly at 3-4 grand you're not going to find a dealer with cars at that price range. You'll need to bump up around 6-10 to find ones at a dealer. You can pay cash for part and finance the rest. The place I bought my Volkswagen was select euro cars in Waterloo. They have audis and vws with some other trade ins as well. They have some older models around 6-10k but higher mileage. No haggling either, the owner Joel is very honest and prices the cars fairly."
Rochester,3dij8w,Bastion2k12,22,Thu Jul 16 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"if you’re looking for a better steak in an arcade setting, you are shit out of luck."
Rochester,3dij8w,sdubois,11,Thu Jul 16 16:36:39 2015 UTC,It's only fair that the upper management of the bar get together to talk shop over top notch steak and some video games.
Rochester,3dij8w,Mantaeus,4,Thu Jul 16 17:01:16 2015 UTC,For sure. Let's talk bonuses.
Rochester,3dij8w,sdubois,6,Thu Jul 16 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"I was just in the mall yesterday, and that wing is getting deserted. The former Uniform Village space is empty, deb's and delia's are gone, Game Craze is gone. Hopefully D&B's pulls some more foot traffic down that way."

Rochester,3dij8w,flcl4evr,3,Thu Jul 16 19:49:33 2015 UTC,That's weird; the chain as a whole seems healthy enough.
Rochester,3dij8w,LtPowers,6,Thu Jul 16 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"All of these new entertainment venues in Henrietta are great for the area hotels. We already do quite a huge chunk of sports business year round on the weekends but we can always use more. Tournament organizers are always looking for regions that not only have available play space (fields, rinks, etc) but also lots of restaurants and entertainment for the sporting families for when they are not playing matches. Tournaments that start out small can grow larger and larger year after year from word-of-mouth experience testimonials from the teams.   Also, us a hotel managers really appreciate having fun places to recommend to our sporting guests to get them out of the hotel when they are not playing...they drive us crazy just hanging out in the lobby!"
Rochester,3dij8w,jrrhea,8,Fri Jul 17 05:29:03 2015 UTC,So there are going to be two of nearly the exact same thing? I love the idea of both but seems a little excessive.
Rochester,3dij8w,hesbunky,15,Thu Jul 16 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"You're saying Dave and Busters is the same as Lasertron? I don't see any video games at Lastertron, and I don't see any Lasertag at Dave and Busters.  Seems pretty different to me, but very complimentary.  Makes good business sense (in my mind anyway) to have the Lastertron, Dave and Busters, and the Go-karts all near each other. I'm probably wrong though, admittedly I know nothing about business."
Rochester,3dij8w,I_DONT_CAR,7,Thu Jul 16 16:51:07 2015 UTC,Lasertron has a bar and arcade as well as alot more things that Dave and Busters doesn't have.
Rochester,3dij8w,hesbunky,7,Thu Jul 16 16:56:01 2015 UTC,Ah ok. I've never been there and I looked all over their website but could not find any mention or pictures of arcade games. Thanks.
Rochester,3dij8w,I_DONT_CAR,4,Thu Jul 16 17:50:37 2015 UTC,Back in my day there was laser tag and a decent arcade in Pittsford but now it's a movie theater with wanna be AMC Webster seats.  Also Jillians.   I'd give d&b 1 year till they fold here unless they have good beers and cheap games.
Rochester,3dij8w,IPbanned,3,Fri Jul 17 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"When you say ""my day"" how far back are we going? I don't really remember any laser tag/arcade that turned into a movie theater other than Funscape, which was actually just next to the Regal at Eastview so that doesn't really fit due to not being actually in Pittsford and didn't turn into anything really besides a vacant section of their building."

We only did the ""Heist"" arcade game thing which was fun, we didn't golf."
Rochester,3dij8w,TeamLittleFinger,13,Fri Jul 17 12:18:57 2015 UTC,Why? Isn't it just great that Henrietta's going to be  filled with abandoned strip malls in a decade because they've never done any semblance of urban planning?
Rochester,3dij8w,chumprock,10,Thu Jul 16 16:29:00 2015 UTC,It's been like that for almost 40 years.. their planning is as much commercial zoning as possible.
Rochester,3dij8w,TeamLittleFinger,10,Thu Jul 16 16:43:58 2015 UTC,As much extremely-low-density commercial zoning as possible   FTFY. It wouldn't bother me so much if they bothered building upwards every once in a while instead of making the entire town a fucking strip mall...
Rochester,3dij8w,chumprock,5,Thu Jul 16 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"Hahaha.. yeah. Or instead of using any existing structure, just rip shit down and lay a new pad.   I'm old enough to remember when 390/590 hadn't made it's way through Henrietta yet. It was such a different town back then, but W Henrietta was always like that."

Rochester,3dij8w,DowntownBootyBrown,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:39 2015 UTC,Henrietta has kept all the commercial development on the north side of town and wide open spaces in the south part of town where people actually live.
Rochester,3dij8w,TaterSupreme,6,Fri Jul 17 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Henrietta's going to be filled with abandoned strip malls in a decade   People have been saying that since I moved here 20 years ago.  I bet they were saying that before I moved here, too.  Granted there's not a strip mall without some empty space here, but I don't see a huge collapse coming anytime soon.  (heck, did you see the D&C article a few weeks back, we're home to the highest-volume Dairy Queen in the country).  Oh, and have you seen our tax rates... Suckers! :)"
Rochester,3dij8w,DowntownBootyBrown,2,Fri Jul 17 12:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, Tater. Grew up here. Moved away, lived in a few different parts of the country. Came back. So many people seem to perceive Henrietta as being comprised solely of Hylan Drive and Jefferson Road. Then you have people misidentifying what highways pass through the town, or thinking parts of Brighton or even Rochester proper are in Henrietta.   It's all pretty funny. Meanwhile, for those who bother to look, we have parks, horse farms, wide-open spaces and super-low taxes."
Rochester,3dij8w,Ilmara,3,Fri Jul 17 16:20:28 2015 UTC,"My father was visiting and we went to the Outback Steakhouse on Jefferson Road. (My aunt wanted to have dinner there - don't ask.)

Rochester,3dij8w,LastOfTheCamSoreys,4,Thu Jul 16 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"because it is Rochester's retail dumping ground.  While Henrietta's population is low, if you look at the total population of the areas within 10 minute drive of Henrietta it's pretty understandable that everything stays open."

Rochester,3dij8w,LastOfTheCamSoreys,3,Fri Jul 17 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You can't go into Henrietta expecting it to be park ave with nice houses and local restaurants and shops.  The chains have to go somewhere, might as well have them all grouped together, and henrietta is a good a place as any to do that.    As far as restaurants, Sticky Lips and Delmonicos are pretty solid non-(huge)chain places.  Heard good things about Mama G's, a pretty unassuming Italian place on E Hen .

Rochester,3dij8w,dxk3355,2,Thu Jul 16 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, Jillians.  Their biggest issue was the arcade games were in awful shape."
Rochester,3dij8w,IPbanned,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"Nice pool tables, bowling, 2-3 very different clubs.  Location killed it.  Much like Centers.

Rochester,3dij8w,PapiMagnum,4,Thu Jul 16 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"With an arcade boasting ""Over 25 classic arcade cabinets and pinball machines that will appeal to both the novice and veteran gamer. The mezzanines will also feature rentable classic gaming consoles like Atari, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis"" followed by a list of mostly boring old games, I highly doubt it. D&B=money=exciting modern games.   There are older niche games that would be exciting too, but even as a hardcore Sega fan I'm sick of playing House of the Dead, and couldn't give a crap about most of that list."
Rochester,3dij8w,balladofwindfishes,3,Fri Jul 17 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"Boring old games? I see a list of timeless classics like Street Fighter II, Galaga and Marvel vs Capcom.  Weird omission of Donkey Kong and Pac-Man though. Especially since Pac-Man is shown on the page itself lol.  Over time I'm sure they'll grab stuff like Pole Position, Dig Dug, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Punch Out, some 90s racers, some 90s light gun games and some newer stuff like Street Fighter IV or Mario Kart. Arcade machines are hard to maintain or in some cases even find to purchase if it's an older game."
Rochester,3dij8w,PapiMagnum,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's 2015 and I can play timeless classics on any console or PC. Arcades are supposed to be about experiences you can't get at home.   Don't get me wrong, I'm a beer snob and a casual gamer and can't wait to go to Swillburger, but it's unfair to compare it to the totally different experience that D&B's will be."

Rochester,3dij8w,crtjer,3,Thu Jul 16 23:42:38 2015 UTC,I think the Kickstarter alone was more of a sign of they didn't realize how much money it would cost to open this business. The Kickstarter page didn't do the best job explaining why they needed the extra money. Remember this project has been like years in the working.
Rochester,3dij8w,StuBeck,4,Fri Jul 17 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I totally understand that. My issue is more with their attitude about it on here, rather than being understanding and explaining it in a friendly manner they acted like we were jerks for questioning anything."
Rochester,3dij8w,crtjer,6,Fri Jul 17 13:14:21 2015 UTC,Agreed! I honestly think they should have explained way more as to why it was taking so long. They had the hype and PR right out of the gate but they provided no information. Kinda like Greenlight :)

Rochester,3dij8w,StuBeck,9,Thu Jul 16 23:59:28 2015 UTC,"People were making comments about how a kickstarter can be a poor sign for a company. Rather than answer the question in a friendly matter, they took a very ""screw you idiot"" tone and cried about how hard it is to open up a business. I think the problem is a lot of businesses forget that potential customers remember these interactions.  I hope it goes well, but I probably won't be one of the people going there based on their comments."
Rochester,3dij8w,IPbanned,3,Fri Jul 17 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed, owners come off as dick weeds.  I'd be suprised if they even open let alone last until their credit dries up.

Rochester,3df21w,EmDeeEm,4,Wed Jul 15 20:45:39 2015 UTC,I haven't heard someone spout more disingenuous bullshit than I heard on that show for a long time.  Red light cameras are nothing more than a thinly veiled tax on suburbanites. If you need evidence of this go read the lengthy conversations about this from Washington D.C. They have more cameras than anywhere.
Rochester,3df21w,OhhhSnooki,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the interesting thing about red light cams here in Los Angeles County, some municipalities still send them out but the court refuses to act on them.  So, if you receive one in LA county, you're totally ok to summarily ignore it and throw it in the garbage, and the court will not come after you.  Anyone who's ever received a traffic citation knows that you have to sign the ticket, and that is your promise to appear in court on the date and time listed.  Red light tickets just arrive in the mail, with the court date, but the court acknowledges that you never promised to appear, so they will just keep your ticket on file and basically forget about it.  It makes sense, with these tickets you never were actually obligated to appear before the court.  The catch with all this is if you call the court asking about the ticket, send a letter about it, basically do anything but completely ignore it, they will prosecute it.  They want to prosecute these, but really, the city can't do anything about it until they get the people to sign their citations."

Rochester,3dgcu4,carpy22,8,Thu Jul 16 01:33:44 2015 UTC,Interesting read. I think people nowadays forget how bad MLS back in the early 2000's. Rochester had a legitimate chance to make the jump. The point is the ownership group and the city screwed up bad and obviously no chance now due to the popularity of MLS.  I did find it funny how KC was the team looking to relocate. Now SKC is one of the most supported teams in the league in one of the best atmosphere stadiums.   It would have been interesting to see if the stadium was built in a different location. I bet if we stayed in the NASL with a decent stadium we would draw better.
Rochester,3dgcu4,The_Norton,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"There still is a chance to make the jump, but for that they would need an owner with actual money.  More than enough people to support MLS in Rochester, not to mention drawing from Buffalo and Syracuse means the regional market is 4 million strong."
Rochester,3dgcu4,Eudaimonics,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:33 2015 UTC,"Isn't the expansion fee pushing $100 million at this point? If we couldn't even get $5 million together when we had a legitimate shot at making the jump back when this all went down, it kind of seems impossible at this point, or at least in the near future.  I do agree with you though, fan support would not be an issue if a miracle were to happen and the Rhinos ended up in the MLS."

Rochester,3dgcu4,r1y23,4,Thu Jul 16 14:33:08 2015 UTC,Very sad story. I remember being at the opening game of the first rhinos season and followed them religiously through the late 90's. I still catch a game now and then but I think the biggest crowd I've seen to date was when they brought back some of the alumni to recognize them. Hopefully we'll see the team popularity re-surge and make a come back but I'm not holding my breath.
Rochester,3dgcu4,wewanttaro,2,Thu Jul 16 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"I remember having season tickets from 1999 until 2008, and I haven't been back since. I have a lot of fond memories of going to the games with my parents, watching the Soccer Sam Show on Saturday's and cheering and chanting the team on in the Stampede section as a teenager.   I've thought about going out to see them play this year. But I don't want to think about how depressing it will be to watch them play among a sea of empty seats and a generally listless crowd."
Rochester,3dgcu4,OpabiniaGlasses,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"I wonder if everyone that was tired of looking at the empty seats went to games, would the stadium then be full and lively again?"
Rochester,3dgcu4,OpabiniaGlasses,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder too. Unfortunately, I think there is a lack of casual support for the team now. Season ticket holders and your hardcore fans are extremely important, but you need those casual fans to help spread the team's popularity and get them into the subconscious. Ten years ago, I could talk to kids in high school who were not soccer fans at all, but they would at least know if the Rhinos were playing and how they were doing in general. Now, I feel like they have a hard enough time getting the media to cover their games. I follow their facebook page, and they'll get, maybe, 10-15 likes for a post talking about when the team is doing well. As a fan of the team, even I struggle to keep up on how their doing now.  I think a decent litmus test will be when the USWNT comes through Rochester for their victory tour. That should give some idea as to if the city is apathetic to soccer in general now, or the Rhinos specifically."

Rochester,3dgccm,dstam,4,Thu Jul 16 01:29:35 2015 UTC,TWC sends a mix of QAM and NTSC signals out around here. If you're not paying for at least the super ultra basic cable (~$7/month) there might be a filter on your line that blocks the QAM signals or something.  Do you get any HD or digital stations? If you don't you're only getting the NTSC signals and they might not carry PBS or ABC on those for some reason.  Could also be that ABC and PBS aren't on the channel you expect them to be on.
Rochester,3dgccm,iangoround,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"Did an auto search, we had pbs for a while but it's gone now. ABC has never come in since we moved.

Rochester,3dgccm,iangoround,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:54 2015 UTC,They can block whatever they like because they own the system.  You should be able to get all the local stations with an antenna. If you're in the city you're not more than 5 miles from the hill where all the TV transmitter towers are.
Rochester,3dgccm,zoltans_of_swing,3,Thu Jul 16 11:13:04 2015 UTC,"I used to rely on QAM without paying for basic-tier through TWC (I did have a Road Runner connection).

Rochester,3dbome,I_DONT_CAR,3,Wed Jul 15 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for checking out the map. I spent over 100 hours developing it! Because Redditors regularly BBQ anyone submitting anything with a hint of self-promotion, I hesitated to submit the link to /r/Rochester.   The sliders have 2 handles so you can set limits to the ranges (ex. 2-4 injuries.) Tooltips are a good suggestion.  Yesterday the map received so much traffic that we exceeded our daily limit of counting requests from Google's free Map service. When this happened, Google returned an error instead of an incident count. It was originally programmed to display ""No incidents found."" if something is returned that's less than one. Since then I've updated it so that it says ""limit exceeded"" if we exceed the limit again. More info on the map can be seen on my blog, Free Help"

My very first thought was to see if I could find bike & pedestrian accidents. And then accidents between bikes AND a second object, like a telephone pole. Hilariously, it took a minute for my sleep deprived brain to realize that the map only makes sense if you assume all accidents involve at least 1 car. (I kept wanting to the checked types to be like the intersection of a Venn diagram) Sadly, if there was a drunk who walked into a telephone pole, I don't think I could easily find their crash information here :)  But despite this limitation, it's really cool to be able to visualize accident patterns.

Rochester,3dc8lm,ryanjeff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"A small but growing solar company with a research and development facility at the Eastman Business Park has moved its corporate headquarters to Rochester.  Natcore Technology Inc. announced Tuesday that it recently completed the move from Red Bank, New Jersey, to offices at 189 N. Water St. in downtown Rochester.  The company also announced that it has extended its lease by an additional two years for a research and development center at the Eastman Business Park. Financial details of the lease were not disclosed. The company is not expected to receive public funding as part of the move.  “Rochester has been very good for us,” said Natcore President and CEO Chuck Provini. “We’ve found some extremely talented and creative employees here. Eastman Business Park has everything a research company could need. And the business and investment communities have been consistently helpful to us.”  Natcore has been working on a number of efforts to improve the efficiency of solar panels by increasing the surface area exposed to sunlight. Just last week the company announced that it would pursue license agreements for a new solar cell structure it has been developing out of a 27,000-square-foot R&D facility in Building 308 at the Eastman Business Park.  Natcore, which has about 10 employees, has been working out of that space at the park. It was Congresswoman Louise Slaughter (D-Fairport) who helped announce Natcore’s arrival to Rochester about four years ago and has been working to concince the company to move its headquarters to Rochester.  “Whether it’s offering access to unique manufacturing tools at Eastman Business Park or providing a highly skilled workforce, Rochester continues to attract state of the art companies and create the jobs that will power the 21st century,” Slaughter said in a statement.  In recent years, the company has formed new partnerships with large manufacturers for its products. Natcore announced about this time last year that it partnering with Denzo Pty Ltd., an Australian alternative-energy company, to produce solar cells and panels there. That work was in addition to partnerships with companies in China and Germany."

I was getting my hair cut there for about 2 years, but stopped going because he was the only reason I went there and then he gave up his chair. That and my schedule doesn't permit me to make hair appointments a month in advance."

Rochester,3d9k70,alsimone,2,Wed Jul 15 00:14:40 2015 UTC,Yup the app is worth your while. I get notification several times a week (sometimes several a day) with openings popping up randomly.
Rochester,3d9k70,jtwood2780,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"He is. I've been going to him when he was in that back room at Henry's Salon.

That said the other barbers (Pieter, Sean, Colton, and Drew) have all given me a haircut and beard trims, and they all do a good job."
Rochester,3d9k70,jtwood2780,2,Wed Jul 15 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a big fan of Drew. Mike had been cutting my hair, like I said, for upwards of two years. He knew what I wanted and for the first time I felt like I could have a decent conversation with the person cutting my hair. A change from previous barbers and a bigger difference still from the days my mom would bring me to Supercuts (shudder).  I understand why he did what he did and I'm glad he's doing so well, but he lost my business for the aforementioned reasons."

Rochester,3db1fu,DjFeltTip,11,Wed Jul 15 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to convince you to stay.  See, I don't know you. I'll admit, this place isn't for everyone. We do have a lot of taxes here, and winters are kinda lousy. (The two are related.)  But Rochester is on the cusp of a turning point. No guarantees that this turning point happens, but it could. And if it does, Rochester will be growing again. That means house values go up and (eventually) taxes become more competitive. Our schools are already among the best in the country. And no other city our size has the same combination of accessibility, diversity, and culture.  Every city has pluses and minuses. Only you can determine if the pluses outweigh the minuses for any particular location. But Rochester is consistently ranked among the best places to raise kids -- both because of the educational opportunities and the plethora of recreational activities.  How many other cities have a children's museum as good as The Strong? And then to have the RMSC on top of that? Not many other cities have as much water access as Rochester -- the Canal, the Lake, the River, the Bay. Top-notch minor league sports? Freakin' waterfalls right in the middle of the city?  Again: Rochester isn't for everyone. It may not be for you; I don't know. But don't leave just because the grass might be greener elsewhere. Only leave when you find a place that speaks to you. Or stay if you already have."

Rochester,3db1fu,r1y23,4,Tue Jul 14 22:49:14 2015 UTC,If you need to go online for reasons to stay somewhere than you should probably leave. I personally think the Rochester area is a good place to raise a family.

I guess I just think that life could be easier elsewhere, both financially and mentally(this climate is wearing on me).  What you get here for a $300k house will cost you 10k year in taxes. That same house out west where I have looked will cost you $450k and will only cost $2k/year in taxes which is cheaper on a monthly basis than the $300k house.  Combine that with the 10-20% increase in both of our incomes, I just am having a hard time coming up with reasons to stay beside the obvious(family and friends)."

I would recommend staying conscious of the value of community and social networks, and be careful about assuming that it will be easy to connect to people elsewhere. I've been pretty stunned by the solid social coldness I've experienced in the NW - don't know if it's just the people I happen to live around, or if it's a wider cultural phenomenon in the NW/West. I'm pretty introverted, but it does get to me when people walk right past me when I nod/smile/say ""Good morning,"" and it happens more often than not in my neighborhood here. I suppose it's a fantastic place to live for people who don't want to be bothered acknowledging the existence of neighbors."
Rochester,3db1fu,IPbanned,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"It's a double-edged sort of argument, really.  Yeah, on the one hand, you could stick around and see if Rochester truly comes into its own again.    On the other hand, you sound like you're young enough -- move!  See the country!  A lot of people move away and still come back to Rochester after a time.  It's not like you wouldn't necessarily have that option."
Rochester,3db1fu,SHUT_UP_PEDANT,2,Wed Jul 15 12:35:41 2015 UTC,"While I do think you should try living somewhere new, especially while you and the children are young, it will be a challenge probably for the first three years.

But seriously, you can always come back!"

I was all gung-ho to move away, make more money, live in a bigger house, have more opportunities..etc. What I found out in reality was that I was making less money than I make in Rochester, lived in a smaller home for far more money, and found out that the all the opportunities I desired were all available for me back home. After a few years of living away, I gave it a long hard thought and turned down a job opportunity in Seattle and in Boston to come back to Rochester. I haven't regretted it for one second. Now I find myself becoming more involved in this community and appreciating all that it really does have to offer."

It's one of those in the middle places.     Out west (California) you have a lot of water issues. I was just reading the mid-west is going to have a big water issue within 50 years. Something about the aquifer that supplies quite a bit of their water not replenishing fast enough. Now you may think, well I'll be dead by then, but your children won't be."

Also it can be hard to get a leg up in a lot of career paths here, better make it somewhere else and then come back when jobs are easier for you to get with your seasoned resume."

You'll be glad you moved when you're making more money and exploring better places than ROC.  Best of luck.  Pack up the car and go, YOLO!!!"
Rochester,3db1fu,rightontimetoday,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"As the quintessential Rochester-hater, I feel I must chime it.  Leave.  I don't think you can contest the argument that ""you don't know the salty without the sweet"". It's ignorant to claim how great or bad a place is if you've only ever seen is Rochester and the beach in front of a timeshare in Florida. Perspective is the key to life.   With that said, move. You will soon realize that a lot of things are better elsewhere. Sure, there are disadvantages in comparison, but they are minute. And don't stick with just Denver and Rochester as your choices. If you end up not liking Denver, then move elsewhere to gain further perspective. And do it again if you need to.  But definitely do your research. Identify what you're looking in a place and research 10 possibilities. Education, job market, traffic, taxes, everything you can, all available via the internet, of course. Make an educated decision on your choice(s). Visit and do the non-touristy things, daily commute, grocery shop, mail a letter, etc. Experience the place as best you can without being there first.   Also, get a job before you move. The job market is quite different nowadays.  I moved to Charleston after extensive research on eastern coastal cities. I made an educated decision of Wilmington and Charleston at first, and let the job market take me to paradise. I have state pride for once, I am proud of this area, proud it's voted best city in North America 4 years running, proud people come here just to see it. I can make my own garbage plates for novelty if I need to and the only things I miss are cheap golf courses, Bill Grays Italian Sausage, and some friends and family. All petty reasons to stay somewhere.  I miss some family, sure. Some people mentioned it's nice for child-rearing. That's quite the selfish dependent attitude. You're living somewhere just to get reprieve from the child you obviously dislike and need a break from? You can't build a support circle in a new place? Ignorant. Family is important, but it's a shitty reason to stay in a shitty area: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3b9mVYP14OwVXYtOGtHeE5oNDQ  Good luck, friend."

If you're looking to get a little ""high class rowdy"" I would strongly recommend opening your bar tab at Revelry instead of Good Luck. They're a little more tolerant of you getting sloppy, and the scene for late night drinking is a little better overall.  If you want an interesting, memorable meal with your friends, I'd recommend the private dining room at Avvino. It's in the basement (but doesn't feel like a basement), has a huge medieval style dining table, a projector, iPod hookups so you can play your own music, and they have a laid back attitude about hosting you.

Rochester,3cx0vg,IPbanned,8,Sat Jul 11 18:08:01 2015 UTC,NYC can be easily 300-400 or more a person after hotels and 15 dollar drinks and transportation.  There is plenty to do in Rochester that fits with my budget and goals for the night--I even posted 3 of my brainstorms that I'd be perfectly happy to choose from. I thought I'd reach out to the community to see what else I have overlooked.
Rochester,3cx0vg,rightontimetoday,3,Sat Jul 11 18:17:04 2015 UTC,He obviously is completely clueless to costs in NYC. I was going to point out the same.
Rochester,3cx0vg,rightontimetoday,-13,Sat Jul 11 18:22:39 2015 UTC,Yes I feel every time I go out in Rochester is a waste of time and money.  I would rather go to nyc to spend that kind of money.  Plus spending $100 each in Rochester is looking for a stay in the ER.  In NYC you will drink but with much more class.

Rochester,3cx0vg,despreston,-5,Sat Jul 11 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"this guy wants to spend a great night out and spend a few hundred bucks with his friends and the best rochester can suggest is spending the entire night (read: until 1:30 when everything closes) at a restaurant bar, the basement of a restaurant, or box seats at a triple A baseball game. jesus christ  if anything stop being close minded and appreciate that rochester is driving distance to a bigger city. 6-8 people $300 each they could spend a night in NYC. things are open all night, its more exciting, theres way more shit to do, and you dont have to drive home."
Rochester,3cx0vg,despreston,15,Sat Jul 11 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"This ought to piss you off, but seems to me you're the one being closed minded here, my friend. A ""good time"" is relative to the person looking for it.  Your idea of a good time might be railing line after line of cocaine in the meat packing district until 4AM, hollering at some platinum blondes drinking cosmopolitans, fighting 30 people to get a $14 cocktail at the bar, fist pumping to some Tiesto, then collapsing in your $500/night hotel room with the 5/10 drunk college chick that you dragged back at last call.  This guy's idea of a good time might be catching a ball game with his friends, drinking some beers in the sun, having a solid dinner, then changing it up from the dive bar to drink some good whiskey, have some laughs, and enjoy actually seeing stars in the sky at 2am on the way home from the bar.

It happened too quick to register but looked like a white SUV rolled down the hill from the ramp that goes over East Henrietta with the engine smoking and blindsided the two cars that were ahead of me. All three vehicles were totaled and I saw at least one person seriously injured. Cops were quick and fortunately a large amount of drivers stopped to help those involved in the incident.

Rochester,3csnlv,sdubois,21,Fri Jul 10 13:24:13 2015 UTC,This car was two cars in front of me and I witnessed everything. We were headed west on Elmwood just after crossing Mt. Hope when the truck seemed to try and pull over up onto the curb by mt. Hope Cemetery. We were stopped for a little while and then all of the sudden the car slowly starts taking a left (now moving perpendicular to Elmwood) at about 5mph and despite my honking he drove straight across the median over the oncoming traffic lanes and up onto the side walk and directly into B&N. It seemed like he had lost consciousness with his foot on the gas pedal. He was just pronounced dead. Very sad

Hope Ave and how frustrated they are with speeding, dangerous cars.  Given what a humongous player UR is, hopefully this will light the fire under someone's butt to do get some lane reduction and traffic calming features for that road. Seriously, they've been marketing College Town as this walkable urban village. Well, until someone puts Mt. Hope on a road diet, that corridor is never going to be truly walkable. I'm an experienced and generally fearless urban cyclist and a regular bike commuter, but even I won't bike anywhere on Mt. Hope.  EDIT: Turns out, that's not what happened and I'm sorry I automatically made poor judgment on the late driver's character. But given the behavior of cars on that road, it was a natural assumption."

Rochester,3csnlv,TeamLittleFinger,8,Fri Jul 10 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, sort of.  I think College Town is actually quite walkable, and pedestrian-friendly.  The more time I spend over there (either driving past it or through it), I like it.  However, as someone who used to live in the South Wedge, closer to Mt. Hope, the drivers are fucking CRAZY.  I sent letters to the City for a bit, trying to get speed bumps installed on our street in order to curb the speeders who'd drive through -- only to be told that no, they couldn't build them because it'd just move all the speeding traffic to some other residential street that ran from South to Mt. Hope.    But I digress -- my point is that people have flown down Mt. Hope like it's 390/490/590, going over the speed limit and changing lanes sans turn signals.  Now that College Town is in full effect, people still have this attitude that they're entitled to drive this way -- and they don't consider that it's not going to work anymore for them.  They'll try to speed around the Ford Street Bridge; they'll try to speed around the 390 interchange.  But in between, it's not.going.to.work.anymore.    Your assumption is completely valid; I can talk about this sort of entitlement happening on Mt. Hope, but it's everywhere.  Lately (and I don't know if it's just my bad luck or what) I've seen many more examples of idiotic driving, which makes me proud of the fact that I try to stay seriously alert of other people.  I can't trust them.  All that being said, I still love driving."
Rochester,3csnlv,icedcoffeeblack,3,Fri Jul 10 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"People drive like psychopaths on Park Ave, too. I don't get it. Rochester drivers are fucking snails on the highway and in the suburbs, and they're speed demons on city streets with heavy pedestrian traffic. It's actually fucking infuriating after moving here from Massachusetts. People drive 80+ on the highways there, but most people drive sanely in urban areas. Here, everyone drives under 70 on the highway like a bunch of old ladies, but the second there's pedestrians you can kill, you do 20 over and blow red lights like there's no tomorrow. No wonder NYS has such a high rate of traffic fatalities..."
Rochester,3csnlv,DowntownBootyBrown,4,Fri Jul 10 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"True.    Had a guy on West Henrietta Road try to rev his engine and swerve through lanes (this is roughly across from Jay's Diner) in his white Corvette.  I couldn't figure how this guy figured (a) he was impressive, (b) he was going to get ahead of anybody, and (c) how he thought it was worth speeding up, just to hit the light (going south) at West Henrietta and Brighton-Henrietta Town-Line.    Jefferson Road's just as bad.  I could cite a bunch of instances where people don't care; I don't think it's drivers in general, but it's people with a gross sense of entitlement who don't take other people into consideration -- and it transcends driving.  These are the same kind of people who can't get off their phone to order a cup of coffee.  Rudeness is, unfortunately, quite pervasive these days."

As other have indicated, it unsustainable -- especially given the failing infrastructure of many of the older buildings. And I'm pretty sure that the academic side has doubled in size in the approximately 20 years since I graduated (then CIMS was the only new building).  Part of the reason is that it's easier to get funding to build than it is to repair.

Rochester,3crj5w,ExcitedForNothing,5,Fri Jul 10 16:03:06 2015 UTC,The growth rate is unsustainable. I wish RIT would focus their fundraising efforts on reducing tuition instead of building more buildings.
Rochester,3crj5w,wsender,3,Fri Jul 10 11:44:42 2015 UTC,"While I think the endowment has finally grown under Destler (part of the reason he was initially hired), the fact is that RIT is still primarily funded through tuition dollars. Hence the desire to grow the number of students on campus (and historically, the reluctance to let any students go -- in particular those who are fail).  Cynically, that's also why the school had to institute an ""honors"" program -- because in general, classes are pushed to be more ""inclusive"" (read as lower expectations on student work) to ensure the widest amount of student success.  Basically, they couldn't reduce the tuition if they wanted to... And that's before we get to the radical bloat in the administrative side of the institution and the growth of non-academic infrastructure on campus."
Rochester,3crj5w,mattBernius,4,Fri Jul 10 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"100% agree with this, they have been growing like that since I was there 06-10.  It would also be nice if they didn't always put these buildings over parking lots that they never replace either."
Rochester,3crj5w,WordMasterRice,-2,Fri Jul 10 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"lol.  thats what colleges do.  they care deeply about their students, and try to reduce their economic burden.  building buildings is one way colleges hide all the money they're raking in."
Rochester,3crj5w,oranjuicejones,6,Fri Jul 10 12:56:00 2015 UTC,The issue with that is none of the money for this is from the school. It's all from the state or companies for this specific purpose.

They are renovating existing buildings, but the process has been slow and there are a LOT of infrastructure issues. In the past the Deans ended up doing a lot of shifting of infrastructure funds towards new buildings based the promise of future work on their existing buildings.  The SAU was renovated, but it still remains that most of the older buildings need a lot of infrastructure work. This isn't really a dig on the campus, it's just that the original buildings are now 40-50 years old.  And I have no idea how things are on the Dorms side of the campus."

When I moved in, the contractors they used installed shit wrong outside so it took 3 days to unfuck it. I was taking summer classes so I had to go to coffee shops to do my work and it was inconvenient as fuck.  The base speed is the same as cable, and the speeds we all want are pricey to say the least.   They use an answering service for calls so you can't get ahold of anyone. You have to leave a message and wait for someone to call you back.  They arent exactly the second coming of jesus, but they aren't twc, so there's that."

I had them briefly before I had to move, and they did have to come back to fix my internet after the initial install, but that was because my old place was a shithole and the electrical wiring was all fucked up. Now I have TWC again, and my internet loses connection daily. TWC double billed me, their support took hours just to do an install, and they throttle the shit out of my connection. Greenlight called me right back (the tech that came out for the electrical issue actually gave me his cellphone number), and I never had an issue, except that they're taking forever to install anywhere else."

That's $100 total  I can do 1000/100 for $75 extra. That's $125 total  Sure its nice that I could get crazy high speeds, but damn that's a lot of money.  Those prices/speed beat twc obviously. Maybe my expectations were too high. I picked this place specifically because of greenlight (its a great apt too) and seeing the speed on the base level and cost to upgrade plus my first experience with the company being without internet for 3 days when I really needed it just sort of dampened my jubilation.

Upon checking the website, they actually have conflicting information on their internet plans page. For my zip (14620) they show their 300/20 plan for $65. When I go through and try to buy it, they throw an error, and when I go back, it shows only 50/5 max for the $65 I pay. If I refresh the page, it'll still show 14620, but it'll show the nicer plan structure.  If they'd actually get their dicks out of the FCC for a few seconds, maybe they'd actually upgrade service in my area to the point where I'd be more than happy to pay $65. But something tells me they're selectively upgrading in areas with Greenlight so that they can compete, and a website glitch is periodically showing me that ""please don't leave us"" structure. 300/20 and 50/5 is a huge gap when I could have probably moved in a few blocks away and locked in that speed; I can't seriously imagine they would be pricing competitively on internet service..."

From the stories he used to tell me, the Cadillac is dangerous but interesting to say the least."

Rochester,3cp4eq,sdubois,2,Fri Jul 10 11:01:51 2015 UTC,I actually called them once. They said they don't have an hourly rate.

Rochester,3cqvzy,Cornhillthro,6,Fri Jul 10 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"There should be a booth set up tomorrow around Adams/Fitzhugh where you can pick up parking passes.  They allow you to park in the resident lots, one of which is the Nordon parking lot, during the day of Saturday and Sunday (7 am - 7 pm) since the roads around Corn Hill will not be accessible.  You can bring your car back during post-festival hours, but it needs to be gone again by the morning when the streets close.  If you get a Corn Hill Gazette mailing, there will be information in there with which streets are closed off and where the parking lots are.  As to the number of permits per household vs car... not sure on that one.  Hope this helps!"
Rochester,3cqvzy,typicalinnocense,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:41:33 2015 UTC,Thank you for the explanation!
Rochester,3cqvzy,milkforbabyghost,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"The Gazette says it's two per household, but the festival page says only one because spaces are limited to 200. I'd go with what the web page says. It does also say no parking starting 7am on Friday and ending 8am Monday, which I think is hooey. People will start setting up their tents in the afternoon on Friday, so I'd try to be clear by then because things will get pretty congested. If you need to stash a second car somewhere for the weekend, PM me and I can hook you up with a safe, off-street space that will be blocked-in during fest hours, or you could take your chances trying to find a space on an open street tomorrow night."

But again, thanks for the offer. :)"

Rochester,3cr3xk,havearemotecontrol,4,Sat Jul 11 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"this is a tough one. There are all the museums of course, but there are hidden spots that area really worth seaking out. There's the subway of course. and there's the cobb's hill water towers. Both are lit up with beautiful street art. In the same note, look up Wall Therapy the international mural festival. They're going on the week you get in so look it up and try to see some artists at work.   There's also the 3 Water Falls."
Rochester,3cr3xk,flameofmiztli,5,Fri Jul 10 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"UR graduate here (not in your field, though)! I lived there for 6 years and hope to move back. I loved taking walks in the Genesee Valley Park. Some of the trail goes along the west side of campus. On the other side of campus is Mt. Hope Cemetery, which is awesome, especially at peak fall color. Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass are buried there.   I also loved attending compline at Christ Church (Episcopal) downtown, which is an entirely sung/chanted service by candlelight, about 30 minutes long, at 9 p.m. It's a Christian service based on monastic prayer before bed, but I also know people of other faiths and non-religious people who loved going - people just come in quietly, sit and listen/meditate/pray, then leave quietly. There's no sermon and no proselytizing. Most of the singers are affiliated with Eastman, and on the first Sunday of every month, it's preceded by a concert (always something quiet and relaxing, in keeping with the atmosphere of compline) that starts at 8:30. I highly recommend trying it out during any intensely stressful times, which are usually part of grad school.  Some of my favorite restaurants were Dinosaur Barbecue (expect a wait at peak times), Thali of India, and Tap and Mallet (food was sometimes good and sometimes just okay, but the beer list was always great).  If you want to drive out of town, check out Letchworth and anything around the Finger Lakes. Sodus Lighthouse on Lake Ontario is picturesque, and you can go up into the tower. There are also a lot of farms around the city where you can pick apples and get fresh cider and donuts in the fall.  In the spring, there's the Lilac Festival. I don't care one way or the other about the festival itself, but the lilacs in Highland Park are glorious.   I also miss the public market - plenty of cheap, local produce.  In conclusion, I would like to move back to Rochester soon, and I hope you enjoy yourself!"

Rochester,3cr3xk,Ilmara,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:14:25 2015 UTC,It is! It starts in October and runs through April.
Rochester,3cr3xk,idk2000,7,Sun Jul 12 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"The RocWiki is a great resource, especially for shopping, dining, and city neighborhoods. I personally recommend ARTISANworks and the Memorial Art Gallery, and not to mention First Fridays at the Hungerford and Anderson Alley buildings.   As a graduate student, you will likely need coffee. We are very fortunate to have a strong local coffee culture here instead of being overrun by Starbucks. I strongly recommend our third-wave places: Joe Bean, Fuego, and Pour Coffee Parlor. But Press Coffee Bar is the best study space, IMHO."

Rochester,3cr3xk,FlourCity,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:45:58 2015 UTC,I really like the Village Gates. Best piercer ever there.   When I first moved here everyone told me to see a lacrosse game and get a trash plate. Never saw either before. Lax was interesting. My tummy didn't handle the plate well and I only had about a third. Pace yourself.
Rochester,3cpxtq,abx2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"Information from HotShots regarding the event:   The Flower City Four Man (formally the Ten Ugly Men Volleyball Tournament) will be held July 25th at Genesee Valley Park, Rochester, NY.
