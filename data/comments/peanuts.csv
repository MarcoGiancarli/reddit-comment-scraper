peanuts,3aacht,yttrium13,2,Thu Jun 18 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"I too have been repeatedly watching the trailer, even downloaded it to have it on demand as I want! You've brought up a very good thought that I too have been wondering. Those elements you've listed, I would described as the ""magic feather"" format.  I predicted in another thread:   I have long predicted that the plot will involve Charlie Brown going for The Little Red Haired Girl, and it's nice that fully confirmed. I will further predict that Charlie Brown fails getting The Little Red Haired Girls attention, but turns out to be a hero for inadvertedly succeeding at something else.   This is a rough outline, in addition I imagine there will be some complex plot twist that's subtly set up throughout the entire movie. If this happens, this will become my favorite animated movie ever.   And the trailer looks to be downplaying (though not completely ignoring) the more depressing side of Peanuts.   Compared to the trailer of A Boy Named Charlie Brown, which jumps straight in with the failure face scene, it would indeed appear to be downplaying. However, I think the trailer suceeding at a uniform balance of qualities, managing to capture the spirit of each character so perfectly.   I don't think A Boy Named Charlie Brown quite lives up to its potential   That's something I really wanted to admit, but you now mention it. While it's still a great movie there were some things about the cinematic, production and execution of it that I thought really would have completed it."
peanuts,3aacht,anjumahmed,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does a lot of things right, but it does have issues with pacing (kind of feels like a double TV special padded out to a full length movie) and uneven animation quality. Which is why I like the idea of a more elaborate and polished reimagining of ABNCB. Almost no one besides hardcore Peanuts fans remembers it anyway."
peanuts,3aacht,anjumahmed,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:46:14 2015 UTC,"No doubt that this movie in animation and cinematic quality will comparitively be off the charts. The pacing, I have strong hopes for."

peanuts,3a8qe4,anjumahmed,2,Thu Jun 18 10:35:11 2015 UTC,"It's truly impressive how much work went into a single strip (especially on Sunday), and even more so when you realize that Schulz produced these, by hand, every single day for decades.  In today's digital world, we won't see craftmanship like that again.  Also, I'm always blown away by how beautiful his printing was - so distinctive and precise."

peanuts,39a0n5,Sno0pyBo0,4,Wed Jun 10 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"Peanuts were always part of my life. I remember watching the holiday cartoons before I could read. I had coloring books and toys too. Once I could read I would read the funnies in the paper, and buy the paperback collections. My wife and I even made a side trip to the Charles Schultz Museum in Santa Rosa while on our honeymoon in Sonoma."

peanuts,39a0n5,Rheul,3,Wed Jun 10 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"My grandfather was a minister for about 75 years.  He started when he was 17 and stopped going to professional functions in his 90's.  I probably saw him preach about 50 times in his life.  He was an old school love and warmth kind of preacher.   His sermons, either as an integral part or as an addendum, always included that day's Peanuts.  He's the only person in the world who could read a comic strip out loud and make it just as good or better than reading it yourself.  It was magic.   He died in June at 97. His great-grandkids now all have the peanuts books and memorabilia his parishioners have him over the years."

Watched the holiday specials every year religiously (pun intended) and my cousins and I all prided ourselves on our 'Cyclopedias and McDonald's glass collection. I only have one now but I'm still planning on snapping up a set of the tall glasses, at least.
