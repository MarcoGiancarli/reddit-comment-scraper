I understand that without being eligible to get a security clearance a lot of jobs are out. That's out of my control. But almost all of non-cleared positions are either internships or they want someone with a lot of experience, there are no junior/mid level jobs in Reverse Engineering positions.   Maybe I do not have the needed skillset, I do thick client projects at my current job around half of the time but due to time constraints I cannot do a lot of RE and am mostly proxying and then reversing traffic. Think one week for a client/server app.  Every time I interview with a company, they offer me appsec positions (webapps, mobile apps, source code review). These are things that I can do decently but they are not the things that I am passionate about.  How do I build up my skills to be considered for RE positions and not appsec. How to do I get out there?  Thanks for your time.  PS: If this kind of question is not intended for this thread, please let me know and I will remove it."

There is a ""Replicate"" button in development mode that pushes all of your changes from the primary server to the secondary. It is recommended by Tech Support that you replicate once a day while doing development, but it is not seen to be needed during runtime.   However, we use a lot of internal memory variables that need to the same on both servers in case the primary fails. It is not catastrophic if some values are lost, but we figure they should be accurate to the last day or so.   My question is this: How can I make a script to force this replication? I need to determine exactly what the button does and what it sends to the primary server to trigger the process. The trick I learned from this sub last time was to check for command line parameters in the Task Manager. This will not work for me this time as everything is run as a service.  I have determined that ServerFramework.exe does most, if not all, of the work, but when I try to run it myself, it simply creates another instance.   I know this may be a tall order, esp for someone like me (a SCADA programmer, not a decompiler), but is there a way to pick up on this communication so I can script my own button?  Tech Support has already told me that there is no other way to trigger a Replication than from the button they provided, but you guys helped me prove them wrong before, so I am hoping you can do it again.  Thanks!"
ReverseEngineering,3dmq6d,Parsia,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"I am not quite sure about how exactly things are deployed. I am going to make some guesses.   I assume that the ""button"" is in an application running on machine A, when pressed it will run ServerFramework.exe with some parameters and then some traffic is sent to machine B. Is that correct?  But I am going to make two guesses:   You want to see the command line parameters that are used to run ServiceFramework.exe. You want to see the traffic.   For 1: You can use Process Monitor, which is part of Microsoft Sysinternal Suite. Process Monitor or Procmon will list events. You can filter through these events. Be sure to run it as admin (I usually forget).  For the first filter you can have something along the lines of ""ProcessName contains ProcessWithButtonName"" (exact filter ""is"" can also be used but I usually prefer ""contains"" as it gives me more leeway). If button spawns its own process you can add that. Note that you do not need to press the button to start filtering, you can run procmon before and also put your own filter in place.  After this, you can save the event logs for later use.  Another good filter is ""Operation."" You can filter by different operations. One operation that is going to be of interest for you is going to ""Process Create."" If will let you find child processes. This may or may not work, as I am not sure how the button is passing info to ServerFramework.exe.   For 2: You can use different tools. Take a look at this comment that I wrote a while ago. But instead of that netstat command you can use ""netstat -B"" to look at connections by process. However, I would suggest to use tools (Wireshark or any of the Microsoft tools).  This will show you raw traffic. If traffic is sent in plaintext then you will be able to see it. If not and the application is using TLS you will be able to see the handshake. Assuming you know the destination, you can filter traffic by destination IP address (or from netstat).  In procmon, you can also filter by ""Operation is TCPSend"" to see if there is traffic. It will also show you the endpoint.  Another tool is Echo Mirage. If the button is using TLS with popular libraries (or plaintext) it will allow you to see plaintext traffic.  Hope this wall of text helps.  EDIT: Forgot to actually link the comment initially."
ReverseEngineering,3dmq6d,Sut3k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"So the button does not start the ServerFramework, it is already running. Using the Process manager I can see the TCP send and receivea but I cannot see what it is actually sending. I don't see another column go add to show this information. Do I need Wireshark for that? Although, if there is handshaking to verify security, I'm not sure I will have the technical knowledge to replicate the command. Could I get around that by running my command locally?"
ReverseEngineering,3dmq6d,Parsia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"yes, you will need Wireshark or Netmon to be able to see raw traffic.

So we want to do all graphical updates in the vertical overscan/retrace region. The amount of stuff we can have moving on the screen at once is limited by how quickly we can do these updates. To get the best performance, the update functions are in the form of unrolled loops. When we reach the end of one loop we need to jump into the right place in the next one (depending on the size of block we need to draw next).

I am really sorry for the inconvenience of your seat :( It will take place in the same place of last year :( You are the first to tell us this feedback. I will discuss that with the rest of the team, maybe we could provide a solution (like a cushion) for people that have a problem with the seats. Thanks for this feedback"

This blog showed how to bypass each check. But bravo to the Subway app developers for at least trying to do it right."

ReverseEngineering,3clfzc,samppaaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"It said in the video that it's not detectable by current anti-debugging techniques, why wouldn't they detect them injecting .so into the process? Also you need to write the bootstrapper into the memory, wouldn't some kind anti-debugging guard be able to detect this? I am quite a noob when it comes to RE so excuse me for my stupidity."
ReverseEngineering,3clfzc,0xDEADB00B,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"With the current implementation on Windows and Linux it is indeed easy to detect the presence of the .dll/.so, however, on Mac and iOS Frida manually maps its .dylib into the address space of the remote process, which means it won't show up when enumerating the loaded libraries. It will however be visible as additional mapped memory ranges, just like the bootstrapper, but recognizing those ends up as an arms race, and on general-purpose OSes it is quite hard to account for all the memory ranges due to ever-evolving system libraries across different OS releases."
ReverseEngineering,3clfzc,berryman13,2,Wed Jul 8 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"You could also manually map the PE files on Windows, which is a good way to avoid detection.  Gonna read the source tomorrow. Thanks for the release (even though I suck at JS which requires me to do a big rewrite)."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,alain_proviste,-4,Tue Jul 7 21:23:12 2015 UTC,downvotes.. unbelievable.
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,_patois,5,Sat Jul 11 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe the downvoters don't believe in (or don't want to support) gender discrimination. I understand OPs points about girls hiding in the corners, but I myself believe that both genders should have equal rights to participate in things like these."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,tssge,-4,Sun Jul 12 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"Gender discrimination? With a less narrow minded and selfish attitude, this should actually be seen as a huge chance and enrichment."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,_patois,6,Mon Jul 13 04:55:41 2015 UTC,"It is gender discrimination. I mean the very definition of gender discrimination applies to this.  I have nothing against women in IT, apologies if you see me as selfish and narrow minded. However, I am against gender discrimination, whether it's women/men in IT or women/men in any other industry.  It's great that people make workshops like these. I mean I'd like to attend myself if one would be held near where I live. But when you start separating genders on purpose, you will start broadening the gap between sexes. I just don't believe that's the way to go."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,tssge,-5,Mon Jul 13 11:02:55 2015 UTC,"In contrast to your opinion, I do not believe that this is gonna separate genders in IT (and especially in RE!) at all but instead it's gonna bring more women into the field in the first place! If this step just remotely raises the chance to have any/more female reverse engineers as coworkers in the hopefully near future, how can you grudge? Sorry to say so but don't you think calling this ""gender discrimination"" makes one sound like a real pussy?"
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,_patois,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether you consider it justified or not, it is gender discrimination.   ""discrimination"": treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit.  The category in this case being gender."

ReverseEngineering,3ch336,CastrumFiliAdae,5,Sun Jul 12 20:06:42 2015 UTC,Well it sucks if you'd like to attend events like these and you can't because the thing between your legs is of wrong type. Not a huge fan of sexual/gender discrimination myself.
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,tssge,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"It does suck to be shut out of neat things, doesn't it?  https://www.google.com/search?q=reverse+engineering+workshop+2015  I'd put money that most of these are male-dominated. If you feel shut out because one focuses solely on women, congratulations, you have a glimpse of what it can sometimes feel like to be a woman in the tech industry.  Help make the tech industry a better environment for people of all genders, and then female-only events like this won't be necessary!"
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,CastrumFiliAdae,4,Mon Jul 13 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"You do realize that making events female-only (or male-only) just broadens the gap between genders, right? I mean it separates the genders on IT even further when you start separating them on purpose. I get that we need more women on IT, but gender discrimination is just not the way to go.  It might sound good on paper, but it has a lot of implications for employers (this particular case of discrimination might not though).  For example in Finland there are companies that give internships to people based on their gender. In the eyes of an employer he can't trust that this internship is something that was acquired with motivation and skill but rather gender and the employer has to consider this when employing. Now when there's women who get internships because they're women and men who need to do work in order to get one, this will skew the table into wrong direction, not the one we wanted...  A lot of times it sounds that ""positive"" discrimination like this helps things, but it actually pushes things further away. That's why I believe in what you said in your last paragraph: help make tech industry better environment for all. That's what I believe in."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,tssge,2,Mon Jul 13 10:58:07 2015 UTC,I think people sharing your opinion need to try to look at it from the point of view of this conference organizer. Obviously she feels from personal experience that this is a good idea. Yet you are only attempting to rationalize the event against your own (fatalistic) perception.
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,shuffle2__,3,Mon Jul 13 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"I understand that the conference organizer likes to make these events happen and she feels she is making a difference, a positive one at that. However my point was trying to explain that usually you end up doing more harm than good when you discriminate based on the gender, even when your intentions are positive.  ""Positive"" gender discrimination is a very worrying phenomenon on IT that needs to stop, as a lot of people doing it do not understand the implications and innocent suffer as a result. Women are people and they should be treated as equal. When you start treating them as something else, you are doing it wrong."
ReverseEngineering,3ch336,tssge,3,Tue Jul 14 07:34:20 2015 UTC,"I think there's no need to explain anything here. Obviously, the problem is not gender separation, but rather the average (while you were mentioning 'usually') male IT worker who fails in behaving appropriately. Maybe a good thing to include in a female-only-RE training would be a warning of/preparation for the kind of stereotypical coworker that one is very likely to encounter when working in IT (security)... on a daily basis. RE work/vulndev requires you to be resistant to frustration more than often and you need to be willing to fight this frustration... but don't underestimate the ""social"" (or lack thereof) factor. Your comments on this thread sound like you're afraid of a general separation of genders in IT to become reality. Dude, chill :) This is a single training giving women the chance to have a peek at RE, maybe just in order to find out whether they wanna go down this road!  https://twitter.com/kyrah/status/618754592097087488 https://twitter.com/rebeccaslatkin/status/588061034822377472"
