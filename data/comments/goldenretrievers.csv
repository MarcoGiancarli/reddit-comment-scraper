goldenretrievers,3e32cr,pertsix,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:40 2015 UTC,Guadalupe near Austin?  Does your pup handle the trip pretty easily?  I've always been hesitant to bring mine due to 1. me drinking pretty heavily and 2. the mass amount of people

Cost me so much money, as soon as he turned two, its like a switch went off and bam. He only chews his toys now. I suggest when he chews something tell him off, take it away, then give him what he can have and praise that. Every time he has a toy he is meant to have, praise him."

goldenretrievers,3e0eus,bezbum,0,Tue Jul 21 01:57:29 2015 UTC,"Ugh I know your pain. Zep used to chew on the corners of the walls, eat my mums expensive glasses and one time, he even ate money. He ate a $50.00 note lol. All I can say is just keep at it. It does get better as they get older. I know its horrible now. Maybe can you keep him confined away from rooms with carpet, like with a baby gate or something?"
goldenretrievers,3e0eus,pavandal,2,Tue Jul 21 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. I still swear my wife and the dog are in cahoots, as she was bugging me to put in hardwood floors since we moved in.. then we got the dude and he ripped up the corner of the carpet so bad we had to move along with the process.   Have you tried a taste or smell deterrent? We use this stuff on some of our furniture that he decided he liked, and it got him to leave it alone. You'll have to be vigilant in spraying what he's going after, as it wears off rather quickly, but eventually he should get the idea."
goldenretrievers,3e0eus,prljm40oz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:08 2015 UTC,"You might have already tried this, but have you looked into spraying just that area of the rug he goes back to chewing with bitter apple? my golden (now 10 months) had one area of carpet she would pull at and made a mess of, but has left alone once we sprayed it.  Other than that, maybe try to make your daily exercise more intense.  If its just on leash walking, perhaps try getting him running w/ some fetch or even going for a run alongside him.  Hang in there, our golden is close in age to yours, so i truly truly feel your pain here.  Seems like things are fine one week and then the next shes can be a terror."

My Golden wanted to chew on things when he was young, this included DVDs and Blurays but this stopped when I provided him an outlet. He is free to chew on his ropes and stuffed animals but gets disciplined when he would chew on non-approved things."
goldenretrievers,3e0eus,IntoTheWild_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:13 2015 UTC,i second this. my golden is 1 1/2 years and has learned what he can and can't chew because i provide him so many toys. i open a new toy and i put it in his mouth so he knows its his and he's free to chew it. he literally has a laundry basket full of toys so he doesn't become bored. everything from ropes to bones and rubber toys.

goldenretrievers,3e0eus,Jabujie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:49 2015 UTC,Have you considered taking him to those doggy training classes?  It would be good to have a professional train him and he'll get the change to socialise with other doggies.

goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,Kdennis19,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:02:51 2015 UTC,"Hehe, she went through the same thing. We just did 'shake' on each paw separately, then she just started doing this as a shortcut!"
goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,Chantasuta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:23 2015 UTC,Well what's really weird is he has no idea how to shake. We have tried since he was a baby and he just never got the hang of it.
goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,PonderingWaterBridge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"If it helps, we just pushed gently on her paw so that she would lift it, then rewarded her each time she lifted."
goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,Chantasuta,4,Sun Jul 19 23:57:17 2015 UTC,Don't have a full-body harness for ours but we do use a halty and he will happily sit and give you his face if you show it to him. He also comes back or stops if you hold his lead out to him. They are such obedient dogs.
goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,tickif,2,Sun Jul 19 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"Came here to say the same about the Halti! Mine will try to help shoving her face in place for those that dont know how it works. Although they usually have it upside down or something. The Halti is amazing, I was just reflecting that our pup was still just a pup when we bought it and now she is 12 and it is still going strong."
goldenretrievers,3dsuaq,bickets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"Not had ours quite as long, but man he is just a different dog when he has it on.

So when you take it off him, it's a signal to him that he can run further ahead!"

They enjoy walks on the intellectual level, but they truly need hard exercise.  Ball chasing, swimming, running, etc.  They're amazingly loyal and love everybody.  Goldens can be food greedy... we had to break a counter surfing habit.  But food is also a great motivator which makes them easy to train."

goldenretrievers,3dp5wj,akbeedy,3,Sat Jul 18 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"We did the same, kept the counters clear.  When we first got him at 11 months (rescue dog) he was jumping up on the counter.  That disappeared with age and the breaking of the counter surfing habit."

They may lounge around and sleep when you're there, but they definitely don't like being left alone. They love being part of the family.  Also get the best food you can afford. High-quality food improves their overall health, including a thicker, smoother, shinier coat, and  more energy. The difference between poorly-fed and well-fed is visibly evident."
goldenretrievers,3dp5wj,milesofnothing,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:21 2015 UTC,Its tough to find one. Goldens seem to be really popular right now.

goldenretrievers,3dg5ar,Foibles5318,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:10:55 2015 UTC,Serious question: are there any health concerns to this? I was always told never to give my dogs people food but when I think about it I have no idea why. I always thought it was unhealthy but now I'm thinking it is so they don't beg at the table or something.
goldenretrievers,3dg5ar,whynotboidzerg,2,Thu Jul 16 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"Dogs can't eat certain foods, like chocolate, grapes, and onions. The begging is a factor as well."
goldenretrievers,3dg5ar,frogdude2004,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"Dogs have different digestion systems than humans so certain foods can be dangerous or just bad health wise.  Judging that OP's dog looks very healthy (not overweight) and mentions an annual cheeseburger, I doubt she is getting much table food so it shouldn't do any harm for the dog."
goldenretrievers,3dg5ar,swlabr82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"My vet said we can feed our golden any human food that is healthy for us except for the usual stuff dogs can't have.  He said things like boiled chicken, white rice, and fish are fantastic.  Also fruits and vegetables (minus grapes and onions of course).  As far as the begging, it happens.  The dog would much rather have some of that chicken on your plate than the boring old dog food it has every day.  But if you never feed the dog from the table and put everything in the dogs feeding bowl, it seems to help curb the begging a bit."

goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,mtam6,3,Tue Jul 14 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"You usually clean it with hydrogen peroxide and water (50/50) and apply an antibiotic ointment.  Try to keep it dry and clean, and stop the dog from irritating it more."
goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,grand_royal,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"This is the first time in the past three years that my pup hasn't gotten one in the summer.  Basically, I managed to start flea treatments before the fleas showed up this year.  The first time cost me $300 and ever since if it happens I basically just keep it clean and make sure he doesn't mess with it.  If it didn't get better I would take him to the vet.  It should start to get better after 2-4 days."
goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,janus5423,2,Tue Jul 14 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"My dog had a few on his paws and legs this summer.  The hot spot spray from the pet store has worked for him, just have to put a cone on him for a few days when I'm not around him.  He does pretty good about leaving it alone if I'm home but he has to wear the cone when I'm not there.  A few days usually does the trick to just get past the irritation."

goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,milesofnothing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"The most important thing that we do is to shave the area around the spot completely so that it gets exposed to air and isn't trapped under the oily fur.  Comsetically, not so hot, but it's often the difference between a one or two day sore and a big vet bill from an infection.  After the area is completely shaved down, I usually treat it with gentamiacin and a lidocaine spray to keep my boy from scratching.  Sometimes the cone of shame will come out, but since he's a Golden, he voluntarily puts his head in because he knows he gets a treat!"
goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,Pave_Low,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's very important to shave the area too.  We don't have clippers for him so a pair of blunt ended scissors will do the trick, too.  Just cut off as much of the surrounding fur as possible and as close to the skin as you can get, clean the area (with hydrogen peroxide and water or just water), and apply ointment.  We usually have Surolan around the house or Fuciderm.  Then cone him!  It's important to keep him from licking the wound and even when we're home, he'll try to sneak a few licks.  Thankfully, our pup is also food driven so take out a treat and he pops his head in the cone."
goldenretrievers,3d9vu0,nouse4ausername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"From a previous post:  Like many golden owners, we've been through the hot-spot/rash cycle: is it food sensitivity, environmental allergies, space aliens, etc.? It can take a long time to find the 'root cause' if there is any, but until then:   First, really helpful to use tiny scissors and carefully trim the fur. It'll help keep the area dry. For moist rashes that are red and itchy, like around the groin or belly, we apply goldbond powder all around. If the dog is still going at it, you can very gently work some bitter apple around the edges to discourage further nibbling. If the skin looks really red or angry, I use a q-tip to apply some sulfodene directly to the rash, then cover in goldbond. If the skin looks scabby red, or has some pus, or seems infected, we spray disinfecting chlorhexidine solution on it, then cover in goldbond. Most importantly, you might have to cone-of-shame your golden if she's still going at the spot to prevent it from getting uncontrollable. Most dollar stores carry Goldbond-ish medicated powder (be sure to get the one with Menthol + Zinc Oxide). A small bottle of sulfodene costs less than $10 at Petco/etc., and we've yet to go through a whole bottle. A spray bottle of chlorhexidine also costs less than $10 at Amazon.   Good luck!"

It also cools the water that is already cooler than standing water because its coming from pipes that are underground, making the water between 55-60 degrees F.  If you fill a shot glass with tap water, let it sit for a while, it will be room temperature and the air will have dissipated out of it. Right out of the tap definitely tastes better."

goldenretrievers,3cassz,Hermago,3,Mon Jul 6 19:44:35 2015 UTC,Mine does it about 30 percent of the day. But I am rubbing her belly about 30 percent of the day too. So who knows :)

goldenretrievers,3cdulj,duck__butt,5,Tue Jul 7 03:31:40 2015 UTC,Ours seems to be a bit picky but she's been doing really well on Acana Junior & Puppy. We were feeding her their sister brand Orijen (both grain-free) but the high protein content was upsetting her stomach. It's also decently priced (relatively speaking). Cute puppy!!
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,sharksndanger,2,Tue Jul 7 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"I second Acana. Also agree with being careful with Orijen due to the high protein content, especially for younger dogs."

goldenretrievers,3cdulj,Pave_Low,2,Tue Jul 7 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I fed all my Goldens Hills Science Diet and they all lived a minimum of twelve years with few health problems.  I think the sad truth is that if you keep your Golden well exercised and he/she has no congenital issues, the diet isn't going to be the thing that makes or breaks him.  The only reason I would go with a more exotic brand is in the case of allergies, which I have experienced.  I have a Golden now who I switched to Wellness to keep his allergies in check.  We also have a 17 year old dog and she's been eating Wellness for some time.  tl;dr Feed him what he likes so long as he has no allergies and his weight is good.  Benefits from super-premium dog food are marginal at best."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,boneguy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"tbh....my wife an I have become ""those people"" that feed their golden human food. We cook her meals in the crock pot once or twice a week. She LOVES it. We throw a couple of chicken breast in the bottom, pour some chicken broth on top, add quinoa, sweet potato, carrots , can or two of green beans, and some frozen spinach on top. Cook it on low while we are at work and freeze any extra food that won't be used in the coming days. We used to feed her Beneful ""healthy weight"" but switched off of it once we heard how well my folks dog was doing while eating a crock pot recipe. It does come out to be a little bit more expensive each month but not too too much.Just gotta look for the deals on the meat is all. Worth it though cuz like I said...she LOVES it."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,stormeegedon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:39:41 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't the topic of the conversation here, but that doesn't sound like a complete diet at all. It's missing calcium and I'm not seeing much in the way of essential fatty acids. And chicken broth is ridiculously high in sodium, which isn't going to be good in the long run. There's also no organs present, which should generally make up something like 5% of the diet. You have a very limited diet here, meaning you should be adding supplements as well.  Really, lots of dogs do amazingly well on home cooked diets, but I highly suggest you consult a nutritionist and not an online recipe. Dog's have very different needs than humans and it can cause lasting damage to your furry friend if you don't provide him with adequate nutrition in the long run."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,boneguy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Totally not off topic! We are talking about what we feed our golden right? I guess I didn't think to put the supplements that we do put in her food, was mainly putting the base of what we use. We DO though give her supplements such as fish oil for fatty acids, and a product called Dinovite which has a lot of vitamins and minerals that she needs. We are in the process of figuring out a better source of calcium for her diet, we were using a different supplement that starts with a K that I can't quite remember. Have heard from many that egg shells can provide just that though and that they aren't as hard to digest as one would think. Also, we use a very small amount of the lowest sodium chicken broth that you can get. It all mostly cooks in chicken broth flavored water."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,stormeegedon,2,Tue Jul 7 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"Ground egg shells is a common calcium source, and while you're at it might as well add some egg in there too. You could probably get away with just tossing in some water in there and letting it soak in the juices instead of broth. I'm sure the stuff she's getting is palatable enough without the broth. I'd also look into going to the butcher and getting some organs, specifically liver and heart (kidney too maybe? look into that one before buying). These are super cheap to get and you can lower the amount of chicken you're adding to reduce cost. While chicken is good for them, it can only go so far as a main protein, and beef heart and liver are fantastic sources of iron, which a lot of homemade diets tend to lack despite best efforts. I still highly recommend getting in contact with a nutritionist to make sure everything you're doing is going well. Homemade diets are notorious for always lacking something, so might as well double check with a pro. :)"
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,boneguy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:22:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the good suggestions! We often throw egg in there her some variety but have never thought of putting in the shells until recently. Will definitely talk to someone on what else we can do to balance out her diet as best we can!
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,stormeegedon,2,Tue Jul 7 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"To amend some of my harshness, you're definitely on the right track! And it's good to hear you're slowly modifying it to get closer to what your dog needs to have a complete diet, especially by adding oils and supplements (it's impressive how many people don't think about those things). It's also nice to mix up your main protein every so often, just to give your dog some variety as far as palate goes. Heck, once my dog is off puppy food, he'll get a rotation as far as taste goes. I don't think any of us want to spend the rest of our lives eating nothing but chicken and rice formula lol."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,boneguy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"I wasn't taking it as harsh. We are pretty new to the whole homemade dog food world and definitely understand that she needs different supplements in order to get her complete diet, but also totally understand that we have a lot to learn. She has been diagnosed with osteosarcoma recently so right now more than ever we are trying to make ourselves as aware of ALL her needs as possible. People like yourself lending help in the form of advice is always a welcome ""harsh"" :)"

That's heartbreaking to hear.  Is the recipe you use online at all? I'm considering making something similar for my dog as a supplement meal when he has long hunting days. I much prefer kibble out of convenience and it eases my mind knowing someone else did the work in formulating a complete diet, but I'm sure my little dude would love a special meal like that once in a while."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,boneguy23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the morning ruiner!!! Was just trying to explain better why we decided to change up her diet. Had heard and read some not so great things about what goes in to some of the name brand dog food. It is metastatic osteosarcoma being that it has already spread to her lungs, and we just recently had to amputate one of her hind legs to try and help alleviate any pain she was having from the actual bone tumor. She is happy though, and we are trying to give her the most kick ass quality life we can give her! Dogs are the best and she is the coolest tripawd ever. As far a recipes go I will look around and see if I can find one close to what we use. What we give her is a modified version of a bunch of different recipes. i.e. read everywhere to give her brown rice but switched to quinoa because the rice wasn't being fully digested."
goldenretrievers,3cdulj,stormeegedon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been considering adding organ meat to my dog's diet (on occasion when I can get it) but I'm a little hesitant since he's only 10 months old. Even if you all you have is some good, credible sites that can help to formulate a good meal, that would be great. Would also be nice if someone reading this is considering a homemade diet and can do it right."

goldenretrievers,3btvaa,asudan30,13,Thu Jul 2 04:13:21 2015 UTC,Trimming is okay as long as it's not excessive.   Goldens rely on their coats to both heat and cool themselves. If you shave them down it interferes with their ability to do that.
goldenretrievers,3btvaa,admiraljohn,4,Thu Jul 2 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"also, it can cause alopecia and it's not really possible to tell if a golden will suffer from that until you do the shave down and they never grow their fur back.  We actually brought our golden in for a shavedown and got one of the more experienced (older) people there.  She told us all about it and suggested against it.  Apparently a lot of people will just do it and not tell you about the risks of doing a shavedown.  I'm really glad we got her for our first visit - just had them do a wash and trim then went home and educated myself on shavedowns.  I won't ever do it personally.  The really sad part is that shavedowns don't really help keep the dog cool anyway."

goldenretrievers,3bqu9f,insomniac365,9,Wed Jul 1 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"Meh, I wouldn't say this applies to ALL goldens.   Story time: About 10 years or so ago we took my golden - Apollo (~3 years old at the time) to a puppy birthday pool party at my best friends house. This was the first time Apollo had been around a pool and he was so CONFUSED! All of the other dogs there had were jumping in a playing around in the pool. They would do these beautiful leaps into the pool and looked much like the one in the picture. After sitting on the sideline for a while, Apollo finally wants to join in with the other dogs. ""Hey guys!! Hey Hey Hey! I wanna play too!!"" So my beautiful baby was decides to literally walk into the pool. When I say this, I mean he tried to step off the edge of the pool onto the water like it was solid (Like a doggy Jesus). This caused him do do a nose dive straight to the bottom of the pool. I have never seen a dog look so surprised, embarrassed, and insulted at the same time. It was hilarious. He eventually got the hang of jumping into a pool but I'll never forget the first jump."

He's since calmed down a lot, introduced himself to the neighbors, and always greets everyone with a toy and a golden smile. I'm so happy we were able to take him.

She's a bit of a handful at the moment, going through a biting phase at the moment, and nothing seems to stop her. From when we first got her we tried all the usual recommendations, like stop playing, stand up and turn your back on her, yelping. The only thing that stops her is holding her muzzle until she let's out a cry, then she becomes all apologetic, but I feel real cruel doing that to her. Any other thoughts 9n curbing this behavior?"
goldenretrievers,3bgksl,Sparky718,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"I love how she thinks she's a cat trying to get in that box, haha.    In term of your question, there's various things I tried with mine. I'd maybe add a bit of a growl or stern voice when you hold her mouth, that's what their parents do. Dogs react to the tone of voice pretty well; they can understand when you're disappointed or angry versus happy. Dogs with litters will usually use this and hold the puppy's mouth shut and growl at them if they get a little too rambunctious.    By far the best thing to do is just get them tired. They're just trying to take out that residual energy by chewing on stuff. Give them chews, take them to the dog park, or go on runs, all work. Mine specifically would chew on door frames so we started using a jalapeno water spray around specific places and he'd start leaving them alone. I've heard some recommendations about a sour mixture having the same effect."

Good name for a dog, also fitting with the Christmas spirit, so we did.  Little did I know though, that they decided her AKC name would be Miss Princess Hollywood, and that's also how they registered her at the vet. So, being ""my"" dog (they both doted over her 24/7) I was the one to take her in for routine checkups and what not. Needless to say when ""Miss Princess Hollywood"" was called, and 19yo guy stood up with a full-sized, regal golden, a few odd looks were given."

goldenretrievers,3anx13,EnticingKangaroo,5,Mon Jun 22 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"12 hours a day 4-5 times a week is a lot of time for the dog to be by itself. Goldens, especially as puppies, need a large amount of play time/walks/interaction. Unless you really want a dog and can work it out with friends who will walk it etc, hold off on the dog until you get a better work schedule. I am glad you asked though, obviously you care about the well-being of the dog :)"
goldenretrievers,3anx13,ChillyOlive,5,Mon Jun 22 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"Based on the work schedule, I wouldn't do it. Wait until you are in a better situation with work. Your dog shouldn't have to suffer loneliness like that.  I don't intend to be mean, or callous, I just would hate to be a dog in a situation like that. I'm sorry for the harsh sounding opinion. That said, I'm sure after you get better hours, that a dog would be lucky to have you as an owner, since you are caring enough to ask if you even should get a dog, not just ""what kind should I get?"""
goldenretrievers,3anx13,serrol_,2,Mon Jun 22 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"Just a few suggestions on your situation if you really want a golden... and just to preface, I always advise that if anyone wants to get a dog, a lifelong commitment is absolutely needed, period!  With regard to apartment living, it is absolutely doable.  From what it sounds like, you have a good foundation around you to let a dog run off some energy on a regular basis.  But with that said, you will need to be prepared to walk the puppy a lot (less as they get older), sometimes in the middle of the night, and sometimes in bad weather.  Pitfalls of not having a backyard, unfortunately.  If you can deal with all of that and adjust your schedule around this, great!  As for working long shifts, I agree with everyone about holding off until you can get a better schedule.  12 hours 4-5 times a week is a long time for a dog to be alone  But if you really want to make it work, you may have the option to put your dog in doggy daycare a couple times a week, on top of hiring dog walkers/sitters.  Daycare would be a great way to get your puppy socialized, as well as allowing him to burn up some energy.    So I think it is something you can pull off, but please keep in mind the welfare of the dog (as you clearly are) first before you pull the trigger."
goldenretrievers,3anx13,whimsical_cheesehole,2,Mon Jun 22 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, everyone. I appreciate the honesty. I feel one possible saving situation would be if I dropped him off at my buddy's before work. He's got a couple of young labs that get along with all dogs, as well a a big yard. He'd have buddies go play with and room to romp. I'll definitely take everyone's concerns to heart. I wouldn't pull the trigger on this unless I had everything mapped out and had been going through the motions with an imaginary dog to make sure the timing worked beyond just the blueprint. Thanks again!"
goldenretrievers,3anx13,whimsical_cheesehole,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that I think we're in a very similar situation, and even though I had moments of doubt in the beginning, I'm glad I finally got my golden.  It can be challenging at times, and it was definitely challenging when she was a puppy, but with the resources and support, it has worked out.  I wouldn't trade the love, friendship, and loyalty for anything!"
goldenretrievers,3anx13,admiraljohn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"How long can a puppy be alone?    There's two things to consider... how long the dog can hold his bladder and bowels and how long a dog can be alone without being lonely and bored. A good guideline for bowel and bladder control is one hour for each month of age +1, so at two months your pup could hold it for three hours in a pinch.  12 hours 4-5 times, IMHO, is far too long for a dog to be alone, especially an energetic, intelligent breed like a Golden. They want to be with people and being alone that long isn't conductive to their mental well-being.   Honestly, I'd wait until you can devote more time to the pup. As others have said, not trying to sound mean but from what I've learned raising my Golden I don't think you're really in a position now to given a pup the time and attention it would need."
goldenretrievers,3anx13,Hermago,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:44:22 2015 UTC,You can absolutly have a Golden in an apartment. Your working schedule is a problem. Puppies need to pee every other hour or so and even when they're grown up leaving them alone for that long is not an option. You can still get a dog if you are able to get people to keep it company when you're away. It might take some extra effort on your part but I don't see any reason you can't have a dog if that's what you really want.

goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Taste_like_Burning,14,Thu Jun 18 13:34:43 2015 UTC,"Curious, why is his beautiful coat shaved? D:"
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,RitsBits,5,Thu Jun 18 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"My immediate thought. Every time I see a golden with a shaved coat, I cringe so hard. Double-coated dog breeds should absolutely never be shaved. They have an ability to regulate temperature so that shaving is unnecessary...without their coat they are at risk for serious sunburn and the coats never return to normal because they grow at such different rates. Most groomers actually refuse the business of an owner who requests to have his/her double-coated breed shaved. OP, please don't do this again...although, the damage is already done. :( Source: everyone, everywhere."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Regerton,6,Thu Jun 18 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"One of my Goldens (who is now deceased) had a thick double coat, and the first time we shaved her, she was visibly cooler in the Texas heat. So, we did so again one time each summer. Our other Golden has much thinner fur (no or little undercoat) and doesn't exhibit such misery in heat. We shaved him one time, though, and he promptly got a skin infection. So, no more haircuts for him. I think it depends on individual dogs."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,tippiedog,-1,Thu Jun 18 20:08:01 2015 UTC,Always have shaved my goldens.
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,RitsBits,5,Thu Jun 18 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"I realize it probably does make grooming easier and I know how something we've always done before with no problems can seem odd to think, ""Why change now?"" but I would highly advise you or anyone else to re-think the choice. Removing their coat does not make them cooler and actually makes them more vulnerable to the sun thus making them hotter.    He is a very handsome boy non-the-less and he has a very beautiful coat!"
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,godisdead30,5,Thu Jun 18 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"My golden gets 2 haircuts a year. I usually get him shaved down too. He still has plenty of hair that his skin is never going to see direct sunlight. He pants and slobbers just as much as he does with a full coat, no more, no less. Your dog isn't going to die because you trimmed his coat down. These nuts need to pump the breaks on their preaching."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,husky54,6,Thu Jun 18 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"Or, perhaps, you should consider doing more research about your dogs and the way in which their coats evolved. Goldens are not to be shaved unless in case of things like hot spots."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Regerton,4,Thu Jun 18 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"No, no. It's important that people don't think this is preaching or dismiss what is a very real concern. There is a reason why any veterinarian will tell you absolutely do not do it. If you do not believe that it's harmful, that's fine  - but it's certainly not beneficial in any way. Like you said, he still pants and slobs the same with or without a full coat. The only reason I can think anyone would do it is because they want grooming to be easier or can't tolerate dog hair anywhere. In which case...you chose to care for a golden retriever and that comes with the territory, ya know?  I'm certainly not saying you're bad owners - you're just uninformed. I am encouraging owners to do their research and get educated"
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,godisdead30,2,Thu Jun 18 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm so sick of anytime someone posts a pic of their pet here and there is any opportunity to criticize out come the soapboxes. Do you really think that OP is going to care what any of you have to say? Do you walk around the rest of the day with your head held high thinking to yourself, ""I saved a pet's life today!"" What do you think you're achieving?   Either say, ""Oh! Cute pet!"" or shut up. No one wants to be ""educated"" by you clowns."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Regerton,7,Thu Jun 18 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"Haha, you're really weird. I thought this was also a place for discussion about our goldens as well as a place to post pictures and fawn over how cute they all are. But because you know better...  Oh! Cute pet!"
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,RitsBits,2,Thu Jun 18 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't the end of the world that he shaved his dog. There are far, far worse things you could do to a dog. However, for those that may be uninformed, it is very good info to KNOW. If you choose to make the decision to cut a double coated breed whose coat is designed to protect their skin, then that is your choice because...your dog. I don't see anywhere with what I said as rude or demeaning.     What is the point of human interaction if we cannot have a simple discussion? If we all replied ""cute pet"" what is the point of even sharing your dog when you know what everyone will say? Since when was it offensive to learn? If you already knew then disregard what that person says and move on? Sorry, but if you make a post on a public forum, people will reply. That is what people do on a discussion board. You cannot control how they reply and this world would be incredibly boring if everyone thought the same or didn't interact because we were afraid our thoughts differed from theirs.   As stated, double coated breeds shaved down still pant the same, shed the same, have the same amount of hair. You aren't reducing the number of hairs, only the length and the length is what regulates the temperature and keeps them cool. Thinning by shearing can cut down on the amount of hair. I've also found supplements work great and are pretty cheap if you buy in large amounts. Grooming with under-coat brush and bi-monthly baths do wonders. No problem if you are too busy, the groomers are just as good. The dust bunnies and panting will reduce :) I'm not worried if my advice wasn't needed... as knowledgeable people before me thankfully weren't worried when they shared their tips or I may have never known. I've gladly taken that info, put it in practice and have been satisfied with the results. If it helps you, awesome, I'm happy for you! If not...move on."

goldenretrievers,3aa85l,sesquipedalian22,0,Fri Jun 19 20:24:49 2015 UTC,Probably for summer.
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Thaloc,5,Sat Jun 20 01:28:12 2015 UTC,And there's no reason for summer unless it has hotspots. In that case your shave the fur so it heals. They use the fur to cool. It doesn't make them overheat.

goldenretrievers,3aa85l,husky54,2,Fri Jun 19 16:45:23 2015 UTC,What happened to his coat???
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Regerton,0,Thu Jun 18 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"He just woke up like that. That's what he said, but I know he got it shaved.  He's grounded now."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,husky54,3,Sat Jun 20 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"Note - my dog is not outside in the sun a lot. Our backyard is very shaded. We have a lot of rooms with rugs in our house. He finds the cool spots, so I think being shaved helps him overall.  Also, the shedding gets out of control. We had him shaved a week or so ago, so come mid July and August, he'll be fine."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,husky54,2,Sat Jun 20 16:31:48 2015 UTC,"Also, the shedding gets out of control.   Then maybe you shouldn't have gotten a double coated breed--but that's none of my business."
goldenretrievers,3aa85l,Regerton,-3,Thu Jun 18 22:29:03 2015 UTC,"Then don't comment, because I don't recall asking your opinion."

goldenretrievers,3a6uds,dudeReallyoc,3,Thu Jun 18 02:38:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! And yeah we recently lost our 14 year old golden and wanted another because of all the capacity we have for caring for a dog and providing it with love and wanted to rescue/adopt one in need so the goldens from Turkey were a perfect choice. Ellis is so sweet and you can really tell he's confused and appreciative of everything that comes with your own family and home

goldenretrievers,3a6uds,fourarmedpirates,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"That's awesome to hear. It may take some time, but he'll come around once he finally realizes that he's got a safe and loving home. I rescued a yellow Lab that wasn't abused as much as she was pretty much ignored and left outside for the first four years of her life. I adopted her in 2011 and she was very subdued and reserved for about a year as she wasn't used to having someone care for her and let her sleep on the couch and bed, etc. Now she's easily the sweetest dog I've ever met. She never leaves my side. I'm sure Ellis will be much the same way. Really happy he's found a good home"

goldenretrievers,3a1rfi,H_is_for_Human,3,Tue Jun 16 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"My husband and I had a golden that had seizures after a wolf attack, long story short they eventually start to build up an immunity to the phenobarbital. Our vet added potassium bromide, I believe, to help boost the pheno. Good luck and I hope your pup feels better!"
goldenretrievers,3a1rfi,UpvotingMyBoyfriend,3,Tue Jun 16 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"(Not a vet) In humans it is not uncommon to have very infrequent seizures while on seizure meds, but if they increase in frequency or are bothersome to you or your pet, it could be reasonable to increase the dose or add another medication.  Depending on your comfort level, you are probably safe watching and waiting for now, if there are more seizures it would probably be worth a discussion with your vet."
goldenretrievers,3a1rfi,frizzielizzie83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:09:39 2015 UTC,This at least makes me feel better.  Thanks for the help.
goldenretrievers,3a1rfi,Cptrunner,2,Tue Jun 16 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, I am very interested in this thread!  Our year old golden actually just had her first seizures (three over the course of one evening) last week and has been prescribed phenobarbital. May I ask how many seizures your dog had before you started medicating?  I only ask because we're hesitant about starting the drug if on the off chance her bout was an isolated incident.    Edit: I just reread your post and see that you already answered this!  I'm sorry!  I was just so excited to hear of another golden owner with the same issue that I forgot how to read haha."
goldenretrievers,3a1rfi,Vennomus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, no problem!  Ours had 6 before going on phenobarbital, two of which was while he was on another med (zonisamide).  We didn't go on it sooner because he went 9 months between his 1st and 2nd seizure.  He had 3 in 2 weeks, after which we put him on zonisamide.  He lasted 3 weeks until his next one, then 3 more weeks after that he had another.  We added the pheno and he had gone 7 1/2 months until last night, but it wasn't as severe as before and it took him much quicker to recover.    I should note that we opted out of any MRI scans because of cost.  We did a TON of blood work and the vet concluded on the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Also, we were told that with seizure management, it's not uncommon for seizures to still happen, but of course you want them to be much less frequent."

Then you look down at this big, daft and beautiful dog, who stares up at you, their panting gaze putting a huge smile on their face, and the eyes, that never truly grow up from puppy age, and then you crouch down, wrap your arms around their neck and hug them. For they are the dogs that love unconditionally, and you never regret the choice of getting a retriever."

goldenretrievers,39ix78,no_other_plans,3,Fri Jun 12 01:10:12 2015 UTC,"I think your key determining factor is that he still wants to play. Most dogs will shy away from playing if they're in pain. The only problem is, dogs have no concept of ""you'll pay for this later"".  Ours started showing signs around 5 years. She loved to play, but you could tell she'd be slow getting up later that night if she overdid it. We eventually just understood when enough was enough so she wouldn't pay for it too badly later.  Keeping active is important, otherwise you risk letting him get overweight, then that just compounds the problem.  I would say definitely keep playing ball. Flat ground is a great idea, and maybe a couple less tosses than usual, but I wouldn't stop. Especially knowing how much he enjoys it."
goldenretrievers,39ix78,salacious_c,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:28:41 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! This makes me feel better. We are trying to modify our routine to make sure he's not running too much. He definitely still wants to play. In fact I didn't even mention that he wants to play ball inside for a good part of the day apart from his two designated outside times - we only oblige sometimes.  Thanks again!
goldenretrievers,39ix78,salacious_c,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"No problem! Our golden's favorite game was look at my toy/keep away. She'd stand there with a toy in her mouth, tail wagging, and wanted you to go for the toy so she could turn away and run off, just to bring it right back again. She'd love nothing more than to have you chase her through the house, but that's not always conducive to watching TV ya know?  Anyway, for what it's worth, she had HD pop up around 5, and lived a very happy life to 11 years old. You could tell she was in pain occasionally, but it was hardly debilitating. We opted not to go for surgery, because it was pricey and had mixed results. If it was a 100% guarantee it wouldn't have been a question, but even the vet recommended against it unless things got a lot worse."

goldenretrievers,39an88,quartknee720,18,Wed Jun 10 13:30:54 2015 UTC,"My condolences, I like the santa hat picture :) (please forgive the long post in advance)  Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to “death”, don’t really understand this. I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must.  Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk.  It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.  However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.  When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.”  When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)  Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.  But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are."

goldenretrievers,39auop,backspacecentury,2,Thu Jun 11 01:30:19 2015 UTC,Okay I'm convinced. I will call her Phoebe :)

goldenretrievers,38c6hs,susuyoungyoung,2,Wed Jun 3 07:23:28 2015 UTC,It really depends on the dog.  I suggest getting your golden used to having a crate as his safe place.  Both my golden and shiba sleep when nobody is home and I usually leave the radio or TV on for them.  The first thing I do when I get home is take them outside for a long walk.  I do a short walk with both of them and then a longer walk with the shiba because the golden has less energy.
goldenretrievers,38c6hs,matt_the_spike,2,Wed Jun 3 09:55:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend making sure there aren't any things he can chew/eat that's lying around your house when you aren't watching him. If you don't know him you won't know if he'll eat the couch or chew on cords so keep an eye on him until you know him! Goldens in general should be okay alone for a while if they're properly exercised.
goldenretrievers,38c6hs,Hermago,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:31:14 2015 UTC,Toys. Toys. Toys. My golden will sometimes get bored during the day and if she has toys she stays out of other stuff like cords and remotes. I also recommend crate training so beneficial in the long run! The first couple weeks/months I recommend being home as much as possible. Being one year old a lot of what you will need to do depends on what the previous owner did or didn't do.
