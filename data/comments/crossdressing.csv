crossdressing,3e1nzj,queeniet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I can walk in them, but so far I haven't found a good enough occasion to wear them outside the house. I'm a little hesitant to scratch up the pretty red shoes too much!"
crossdressing,3e1nzj,littlemissfuzzy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:32 2015 UTC,"I tried them on in the store. Walking on carpet was fine, but once I hit the hard floor, it was awkward giraffe time.    One thing you can do is take them to Nordstrom and they'll have a cobbler put color matched red rubber soles on the bottom. It lessens the slip factor and keeps the bottoms looking nice. There are some cobblers that specialize in doing this and you could also go directly to them."
crossdressing,3e1nzj,LikeSkirts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely more difficult on a hard floor. I'm pretty good at walking in 4"" heels, but 5"" is expert level for sure.  I had heard someone else mention the red rubber sole protectors... I'll have to look into it. I'd like to see a pair of them already installed first, to see how they look."

crossdressing,3e15zd,simplerhythm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:25 2015 UTC,nice. cute figure. nice eyes. imo you could tone down the lippy for this outfit- the red just seems a bit harsh. something like a more neutral pink or something might work better.

crossdressing,3e08ba,sissy_monique,4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"I hope someone else comes in with a more thorough answer (short of HRT) but what works for me is that i do tons of cardio and nothing else.  I run three times a week and bike to work five times, which since i started a year ago has majorly reduced my overall body fat, improved my posture, and toned my muscle, especially my butt and abs.  I'd say i have a more androgynous frame these days but definitely not feminine, which really is about as much as I think you can do ""naturally""."

Something like runnin +5k every other day (think about marathonists bodies), combined with a protein and calorie deficit (avoid red meat). Avoid High intensity workouts since they increase testoterone. And of course inactivity is the enemy of muscle."
crossdressing,3e08ba,mistselkie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:29:31 2015 UTC,If its just losing muscle mass that you're going for get lazy for a few weeks. Really really lazy. Like dont get out of bed except to go to the bathroom lazy. NASA is actually paying people to do that right now as part of a study. Id link you but i didnt save the link. Just make sure you cut your diet way back too or you'll replace the muscle with fat. Its not the healthy way to do it but it will work.

crossdressing,3dzqfj,littlemissfuzzy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:09:09 2015 UTC,She almost certainly hasn't forgotten.

It's mostly for my own enjoyment while lounging around the house (I don't typically show off my toes in public) but I've got a fairly ""alt"" appearance (I shave my legs as well) and I haven't got any negative comments from friends who have seen them.  In fact, I actually had a fun experience one day finding out one of my punkish friends had painted his toes the same color by coincidence.

And her name is almost Rachel too! (it's Rochelle.) And the first time I put on my wig, I looked in the mirror and my very first thought was ""Oh. I look like Rochelle.""  I don't mean to be presumptuous, but based on the name and the location, am I right in inferring that your cousin Rachel from Long Island is, like my cousin Rochelle from Long Island, Jewish? This has been one of the most unexpected funny things to come out of my crossdressing. I'm Jewish. 100%. It's not like I actively try to hide it or anything, but I think in my male life I ""pass"" (lol) pretty well as non-Jewish. People are always surprised when they find out. But as Martina I look SO JEWY. The first thing one friend said when I showed her my pictures in the leather jacket was ""wow, you look like a rebellious JAP!"" (that's Jewish American Princess for anyone who doesn't know.) Lol. It's obviously because of my nose -- bigger, pointier noses aren't that uncommon for men of any ethnicity but I guess you rarely see a nose like mine on anything but a Jewish woman.   Anyway, bottom line is, thank you for saying that -- as long as I look like any version of a recognizable female person when I'm doing this I'm happy :)"

I don't know all the JAP stereotypes, but she's the first one to tell you them all and check them all off like items on a grocery list. She graduated from Brywn Mawr and promptly got married to a nice young Jewish doctor. She's worked in media, publishing, finance and now she's a full-time mom.

crossdressing,3dwjv6,BepperNZ,0,Mon Jul 20 04:00:03 2015 UTC,She likes the bead too much. I'm not passable in makeup so we were thinking of making it more ridiculous by keeping the beard
crossdressing,3dwjv6,_stiletto,2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"Well, my opinion is that the beard should go for the outfit, but not knowing you or your beard's place in your identity, I can't give a researched answer. Go for it ;P"

crossdressing,3dwjv6,Hollied,0,Mon Jul 20 15:19:04 2015 UTC,Appreciate the comments I have a large beard.   It's part of my style.  I hate shaving it.  Don't like the look  I guess my question for everyone is can I get away with the beard and wear a dress on halloween.  I think it would be less serious and therefor more acceptable to the general crowd
crossdressing,3dwjv6,Jenniferlookingglass,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"On Halloween, you can usually get away with whatever you want, especially if you have a fellow conspirator.  Whichever, I'm sure you'll rock it!  But don't be afraid to try something new if it feels right."
crossdressing,3dwjv6,tinariddle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:38 2015 UTC,I think that you can get away with a beard. I just think that if you are going to be your twin you need to look like her.

crossdressing,3dvlfx,itsfuntofeelpretty,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"I echo many of your sentiments. In attempting to start up a SoCal ""Chapter,"" it's important to me that the culture and values of /r/crossdressing are reflected in any in-person meetups.  I started communicating with one person from my area, met them in person, then set another date for a future night out. At that point I'm inviting others from my area (Los Angeles) to join us. The date is already set and the worst case scenario is it'll just be a night out with Kris. So far I haven't seemed to get many bites, but hopefully if one other person shows up it'll show the rest of the people in my area that there's a safe and inviting in-person community who can help them break out of their shell, should they desire to do so. I guess we'll see how this strategy plays out.  I am a little surprised in that despite having a huge number of crossdressers in the area, few people seem interested. I tried to pick a place with food, beer, and wine, to get varied interests. Some people think an event like this should be hosted at a person's house, I kind of think that's creepy. Maybe we'll be able to get a little something for everyone over time, though. We'll see."
crossdressing,3dvlfx,_stiletto,3,Mon Jul 20 10:34:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I hope you have some success with organizing some regular gatherings with others there in SoCal; reading about it makes me wish I lived there too! (Not that one really needs any additional reasons to prefer southern California over southern Indiana.)  I agree that meeting at a person's home would be weird (and potentially unsafe), particularly as a group is just forming and people haven't really had a chance to get to know others in the group and vouch for them as non-creeps. Nobody wants to spend an evening feeling stuck at a creepy person's house, and definitely nobody wants a creepy person to be at their own or to know their home address for future reference! At the same time, from a different personal safety standpoint, I do understand the suggestion: For those who may be worried about being the target of violence or harassment from intolerant non-CDs, or who just feel a need to maintain their discretion and avoid potentially being outed by running into people they know while dressed in public, at-home gatherings make sense. It's definitely an option I'd consider with an established group of people who really knew each other well, but I think it just highlights that, as far as personal safety is concerned, crossdressers just have no ideal options.  It also strikes me that a lot of CDs in LTRs with women seem to be looking for more of a support group than a social one. I get it: Even with a supportive wife and friends, there are still challenges, and in any such gathering those challenges are likely to come up. Still, what I'd most like to have in my life is some other CDs who want to go out and just have some fun!"
crossdressing,3dvlfx,littlemissfuzzy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:48 2015 UTC,"You and I appear to be in very similar situations :) And yeah, you're right about our category being kind of special among all the other trans-somethings. Personally I'm not really looking to meet folks, but that's simply because I'm not very sociable :) So unlike you I don't really mind the difficulties.  Anywho... Maybe you can pipe in with your general location? Then maybe someone'll popup in here? In from western Europe, to put it very generally ;)"

I think that trans groups would be great, and a good resource, but I can't help but feel that my ""journey"" if you want to call it is much smaller and simpler than theirs.

And it's really hard to find others like me who I can have mutual interests. Like I wanna be able to talk about mutual interests, and the dressing just happens to be a part of it.  A genuine real person. I do have a couple of friends but one lives in CA and one lives in WVA. But they live far away. And I'm miles away from any city to find others and go to gatherings. Too many trans women just wanna talk about being girls and ""the life"". Or, they just want to meet up with you in some cheap motel for hanky panky, which is not why I live this way. Which is fine and I'm not judging anyone. It's just not for me. And travel is limited for me also.    I'm not saying all trans *women are this way. And while expressing ourselves this way is who we are, I'd like to meet people I can talk to, hang with, and have as much fun as a regular dude or in heels.   I feel the pain of a lot of you on here. that's for sure. But I try not to lose hope."

crossdressing,3dutol,LaurenJ_CD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Hey! Welcome. So, before I say anything please know that I'm quite noobish at this as well and I only really started a few months ago, but I have been learning as much as I can so hopefully I help a small bit.  First off your foundation. To me the color looks very well matched to your torso and arms. But your neck looks darker? I can't tell if this is just the shadow of your head, or if you have a farmer's tan going on that you corrected on your face but not your neck. Simple solution is to extend foundation to neck, no reason not to do that especially if you are wearing a shirt with the kind of wide neck you are here.  Lips: I can't tell if you are wearing anything on your lips or not? Not necessarily a bad thing if you are going for a natural look :) In any event, most people will tell you to go with a pinkish color somewhat like this as it looks more delicate and feminine. I'm personally partial to very dark colors but that is because I'm still not out of my teenage angst goth phase. But this is probably not the best approach. I would suggest, if you can, lining your lips just slightly outside the edge of your natural lips to make them look fuller. You can use lipliner (personally I like clear lipliner) and then go carefully over that line with lipstick.  Eyes: Don't feel bad about anything here because this is the hardest thing to master and I am worlds away from doing so myself. You naturally have pretty big eyes relative to your face -- this is great, this is a very feminine trait! They are a nice almond shape too. It looks like you lightly went over your lids with some dark eyeshadow. If you're like most genetic males, your eyes are more deep set than your average genetic female. I think mine are much worse than yours from what I can see, but I think this is still good advice: a key goal should be to make your lids ""pop"" more so that your eyes look more prominent. The way to do this would be to use a beige or ""nude"" (not a term I like using because it presumes we're all caucasian, but unfortunately that's how it's often labeled) eyeshadow on the lids. Then, if you want something more dramatic (as I usually do), you can outline the top and sides of it with a darker color, or apply dark eyeliner close to the eyelashes. (VERY close, which is tricky -- good tip I heard was ""if you don't see the lashes move, you're too far away). Another good thing to do is to put white or beige eyeliner on your lower waterline, this is the part between your eye and your lower eyelashes, and if you're like I was you are shocked to realize that you can safely apply cosmetics in this sensitive seeming region, but you can! That helps your eyes pop more too. And mascara is always a good idea -- long thick lashes are a key indicator of femininity.  Hope this was helpful, good luck!"

Finally is there any CC anyone on here might be up for giving? I'm looking to improve my contouring, especially my nose, chin and jaw as they all scream male to me.

Looking through your history, you have improved SO much and I really do think all your pictures read clearly female now. I understand what you are saying about how some of your natural features might be starting out in a more male-tending place but you have done such an amazing job de-emphasizing them and playing up your female-tending ones. You don't ""scream"" male in any way, I'm sure you would pass on the street (maybe you already have?).

crossdressing,3drvw4,kyliebiboyny,3,Sat Jul 18 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is incredibly fortunate for someone who crossdresses! I really enjoy hearing stories of people who naturally have more female tending physical traits who happen to also have this urge, it kills me to see men who I know would be able to crush it at crossdressing if they wanted to but almost certainly don't and in fact probably desperately wished they were more ""masculine"" looking.   Personally I feel lucky just to be a height (5-8) where I think I can manage to come across as a tall girl but not freakishly so. Heels are not really my thing but I don't think I'd feel comfortable being in public wearing them if I wanted to. Height has got to be a huge marker of gender but you don't hear it discussed much here since obviously there's nothing you can do about it. So I guess all I'm saying is go you, I'm happy for you :-)"

I wear heels more then my gf does actually lol. only a size 10 in women's shoes here. How come you can't dress up at home more often? if i was that cute i'd be dressing everyday. You look very cute and i bet if you went out in public everyone would be checking you out.
crossdressing,3drvw4,ariannacd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"its because of my job, being under the trans umbrella in any was is grounds to be fired, hopefully in a year or so that will change.

crossdressing,3drvw4,HeadBandHalo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:55 2015 UTC,when i do it dressed as a boy i always get the most interesting looks. sometimes good sometimes bad but if i have a girl with me they just assume i'm buying it for her.

crossdressing,3dso4j,Alisonchainz,2,Sun Jul 19 03:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think the burden is on him to explain why god has a problem with it.  If he can't explain it, and he's a cool dude, maybe he can come around.  Turn him onto Eddie Izzard and David Bowie.  I think part of the weird part for people is that there just aren't really a lot of examples of men doing gender non-conformity."
crossdressing,3dso4j,MeHoney,4,Sun Jul 19 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Well as a Christian, I can say that, but it wouldn't be right to just accept something that's even potentially questionable without researching it for myself and praying about it. I think he's just glad that I'm at least taking those steps and not throwing God to the wind since, after all, Jesus matters infinitely more than my crossdressing fun."
crossdressing,3dso4j,Alexandriia,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm less ""Christian"" and more ""Christ follower"" these days. That transition has happened slowly over the course of several years largely as a result of coming to the understanding that the standard Christian lifestyle is nothing like the life Jesus lived. All that gives context for the next thing I'm going to say:  The burden is not on him to explain why God has a problem with it. The burden is, however, on anyone who wants to look down on us to explain why that's an acceptable attitude when Christ was so hard on judgemental people and so accepting of ""sinners"" while he was on Earth.   I'm cutting this reply short before I wander off on a theological tangent that I'm sure no one is interested in. No, really, I could probably write a book on this subject."
crossdressing,3dso4j,Alexandriia,2,Sun Jul 19 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I still like to use the term Christian because in its strictest sense, it still means Christ follower (Or at least it should). I appreciate my dad's attitude because he's not sure if he thinks it's wrong yet, but I feel confident that after he does some research he'll come to the conclusion that it's pretty silly to call someone who enjoy a different sort of outward appearance sinful. Especially when it's not explicit, but rather nice. (And when women have been doing the same thing for ages. :P)"

crossdressing,3dso4j,thubtop,2,Sun Jul 19 14:46:30 2015 UTC,Absolutely. That's flipping things on their head if I ever heard of it! XD
crossdressing,3dso4j,thubtop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"I like to remind people that there are only two groups that Christ didn't show love to before he condemned them: the Pharisees and the moneychangers in the temple. The Pharisees he called out constantly for being so judgemental of others that they lost the point. The moneychangers were actively keeping people from learning about God by setting up in the Court of the Gentiles. I kinda feel like a lot of modern Christians do both. They look down their noses at ""sinners"" and harass them to the point that most said ""sinners"" are never going to consider stepping foot into a church.  Like I said, I could probably write a book."

crossdressing,3dslf0,PolishedMike,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:03 2015 UTC,"First thing, the facial hair. For some reason makeup makes facial hair stand out way more than it normally would (that's a fact I learned the hard way during my theatre days). If your going for more of a Conchita Wurst type look then it's not an issue, but if you're trying to pass you'll never do it with even the tiniest bit of facial hair. But hey, it works for Conchita so if that's the look you want then by all means go for it.  As for the makeup itself, it looks good. What lipstick are you using? I really like that color.  Also, you freaked me out for a bit. You look uncannily like one of my closest friends. And the room you're in looks about like what you'd see looking a certain direction from his rec room. I had to look back through your other pics and see that you don't have a certain tattoo to realize you're not him. Shame though. I thought for a second I was about to have someone to go shopping with."

I will take your advise and use it to improve myself.  this is the first time I have ever had anyone see me with makeup on other than my wife.  As for the lipstick, it is Covergirl Lip Lava #800 and I outlined with NYC Expert Last Lip Color #438 Candy Rush.  I used a very fine paint brush to do the outline with."

crossdressing,3dr1th,Jallin92,3,Sat Jul 18 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"there are a plethora of reasons why people might do a thing, let alone the variety of reasons one might do a controversial thing. I once explained to a different user that sometimes actions aren't for any other purpose than themselves. In other words: it is the end in and of itself rather than an end to some other means. The short version is: when we ask why we often think 'goal,' but not all actions have goals. I don't see for some other end, seeing is the end in and of itself. I might choose ends that I see, but the seeing itself is done for itself. Crossdressing might be this kind of end. This is a difficult concept to explain because the western tradition, especially following the christian tradition focuses on ends and goals of actions. Our language has this baggage.

But on the other hand it can also be quite easy: because it makes me feel more relaxed and doesn't harm anyone else. Why does it do that? No idea, but does it matter why?  I think CanadianCasualCD makes a good point by saying that sometimes thing just don't have a reason, they just are.  I'm also more curious about why they care? Does it really matter why you're doing it? Are they somehow harmed by your crossdressing?"
crossdressing,3dr1th,oox8ue0G,2,Sat Jul 18 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"Hearing other people talk can be really helpful, but you have to be really clear in yourself before it gets easy to talk about.  It's especially hard to verbalize when you haven't really talked about it before. My advice would be to find other people to talk to who aren't your parents, and aren't going to get into fights about it.  It could be a support group, or a group of supportive friends, or someone you just met, or anyone.  Just start talking about it in supportive environments.  That will help you figure it out, and be able to explain to better. And you don't have to have a complete answer before you talk about it.  You can be clear that you are still figuring it out yourself.  Be honest about that.  And that you deserve their love and support through that process, and that you aren't doing anything wrong, and you are committed to doing what you need to be happy, whatever that ends up being, and if they don't like that, then at least they can get out of the way.  You don't need people in your life who are going to hold you back. So.  Get in touch with yourself.  You can at least say that it feels good.  That you are drawn to it.  That's a start, and it's true for all of us.  But the burden of explaining why you shouldn't do it on them. That's the harder thing to explain.  You like it, it doesn't hurt anyone.  Make them explain their reasoning for being against it."
crossdressing,3dr1th,Alisonchainz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"Good question, wish I had an answer for you. For me, it's always been there from when I was young and I think it always will be.  There's been multiple times in my life where I've purged and successfully ignored it for a little while but it always comes back.  I've just gotten used to it being a part of my life at this point."
crossdressing,3dr1th,Stacy_sometimes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"You know, it is a very strange thing for me. I just started thinking about it in the last few months, even though I'm in my 30s. I'm not sure what I get out of it, but part of it is I like how different I make myself."

crossdressing,3dr1th,Lyn724,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"Why do I crossdress? Hell if I know. All I can tell you is that the urge to do so is all but irresistible. The only time in my life I've been able to resist that urge was a few years between moving out of my parents house and my wife moving in when I didn't have any access to female clothing. I tried to explain it to myself once and utterly failed. At this point in my life I'm at the point of ""It doesn't matter why, it's just something I need."""
crossdressing,3dr1th,MeHoney,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"As my tagline says: for fun and comfort  You can read about my first steps as crossdresser over here. In the mean time I've repeated my reasons a few times in other threads as well. But to summarize:   I love the looks of many clothes for females I love the feeling/comfort of many clothes for females (cozy sweaters, breezy dresses) Spending time doing my nails or shaving my legs has become a special and very personal method of relaxing   I don't want to pass, I'm very happy as a male and in my marriage, I don't want to transition or change into a woman. I just like girly clothes and feel very nice and a bit special wearing these clothes."

I'm sure a lot of you can relate to the fact that that's a tense feeling when you have a strong urge to perform the other gender sometimes...if I'm not at least somewhat convincing I feel like I'm not able to do this thing I have a need to do."
crossdressing,3dphyn,StacyLeeUrbanTaylor,3,Sat Jul 18 05:11:27 2015 UTC,"What look are you going for? Saying ""female"" is like going to a bar and asking for ""beer"".

crossdressing,3dphyn,Hollied,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks Stacy :-)   I guess I meant I was underwhelmed because I was expecting, with professional help, to look close to as good as possible and completely female. I had a moment of stress feeling like I still looked so clearly male... I can't tell how much of those thoughts are due to me obviously being familiar with what I look like and feeling like if I can still recognize myself, I'm still seeing male.   The pictures are growing on me though and I'm also reminding myself that the person who helped me is by no means the grand master of all makeup abilities anyway. Still amazed by how stressed I get about this but comments like yours definitely help :-)"
crossdressing,3dphyn,Hollied,2,Sat Jul 18 07:15:30 2015 UTC,I went to this place that caters specifically to CD and TG. I knew places like this levy an embarrassment tax on people who are afraid to shop where ciswomen do so I would never buy clothes or makeup or anything there. But I figured they would know better than others how to do CD makeup. I did learn some helpful-seeming things but I guess I was hoping the results would be more spectacular...
crossdressing,3dphyn,Jessica_Red,2,Sat Jul 18 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I really like your third, fourth, and fifth shots, Martina!  My advice would be to take the lessons you learned from this one, use what you feel works for you, then try other things and look into makeovers at other places (like Sephora or BareMinerals).  You're likely not going to get all of the answers at one place, but soon enough, you're going to find the right combination that works for you.  Stay the course.  You look great so far!"
crossdressing,3dphyn,MyWeekendShoes,2,Sat Jul 18 06:52:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice Hollie, I should definitely figure out how to do the Sephora thing... My comfort level in being open about this is definitely progressing pretty rapidly but I don't know if I'm quite there yet!"
crossdressing,3dphyn,JerricaNicole,2,Sat Jul 18 07:17:58 2015 UTC,"When I did one at Sephora, I was in a suburban mall in a major city and nervous as hell.  When I made the reservation (you can reserve on their website), I dropped in at the location a few days before while in guy-mode to let them know up front what they were getting into.  They were very reassuring and made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire experience, plus on the day of, they walked me through everything they were doing and even wrote up a template to help me do my own makeup later.    Oh, one other thing.  If you look into Sephora, go to one of their free-standing locations, not one of the JCPenney stores.  The JCP stores don't do the full makeovers."

We all like taking photos of ourselves all dolled up, but none of those usually end up on official government documents. Cis-women (and men) always complain about their DL photos, but when they pull their cards out at banks, bars, and airports, it represents them as individuals. And you are now represented for who you truly are."

crossdressing,3dn4d8,Sillyboysillyboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I love a lot of your clothes, but few of them go together. I think the jeans go great with the shoes, but the shoes don't go with any of your tops. Picture 7 kind of works, but I think if you traded out the skinny jeans for boot-cut jeans it'd work a little better. Tops like that seem difficult to pull off though so idk. I think the sneaker/sweater (Cardigan) combo is a little much. You have a white sweater with a red blouse with a white cami over blue skinny jeans on grey sneakers. There's a lot going on there, and not a lot to create the illusion of curve.  Try the white cardigan, white cami, jeans, and white heels. There'll be a lot of white going on there, but those shapes are my go-to outfit. The cami will create the illusion of a narrower frame, the cardigan will add curve around your waist and hips, and then the heels raise and arch your frame a little bit. The skinny jeans might not work well for that outfit, but it's a combo to try until you can access some more colors. The other issue is those are very summery sandals, and that cardigan is very wintery.  I do think pictures 16 and 17 are pretty nice, but don't feel complete yet. Maybe a grey cardigan to match those grey sneakers, along with the skinny jeans and white cami would be perfect. Of course, keep the pendant for that outfit.  Again, love all your clothes, I just don't think many of them go together. I have built entire outfits from that realization before. ""I love these pants but I have nothing to wear them with. Time to build an entire outfit around them!""  Hope to see more soon!"

They make me feel very feminine.   I love the white cami, white sweater and white shoes combo. Didn't even cross my mind. I can't wait! Thank you. Not concerened about the too much white. White is very pleasing to my eyes and I can change it up with a different colored cami.  Congrats on your venture out shopping. You look great, happy and confidant. I'm working up the courage and hope I find as much joy as you showed.   Thanks again for your input. Keep it up and feel free to contact."
crossdressing,3dn4d8,_stiletto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"All those pictures are massive improvements over the originals. Switching out the sandals for the open toe wedges looks really nice with the red blouse, not to mention Red-White-and-Blue is a good go-to ;P  When I dress, I have to ""work around"" and hide my shoulders and arms, and for similar reasons I feel 5 & 8 fall a little short, but are still better than most of your original pictures. The dress and both pairs of black shoes work wonderfully, though, because they're adding curve you wouldn't otherwise have, arms or not. I think the closed-toe pumps work a little better than the open-toe patent pumps, but they're both pretty regardless.   And thank you for this:   You look great, happy and confidant. I'm working up the courage and hope I find as much joy as you showed.   <3 keep it up!"
crossdressing,3dow00,MeHoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"My Merkur safety razor has served my face faithfully for 5 years now, i'll never buy another one...for my face.  I had a very very bad experience shaving my legs with it, i cut the hell out of myself and got really bad razor burn & ingrown hairs.  Since then I've found two razors that i really like for shaving sensitive areas: the Venus Divine and the Gillette Fusion.  Both are about the same price and do a really good job of giving me a smooth shave with minimum irritation.  No experience with dollar shave club though, but if they have any triple-blade razors that have some flex for the shin bone, knees, etc that safety razors don't have, they'll probably be fine :)"
crossdressing,3dow00,d89560,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard good things about the Merkur. Maybe if I ever decide that it's ridiculous to be shaving with a razor older than my dad I may pick one up.  The Venus Divine and Gillette Fusion both have the same problem that prompted me to go looking for a new razor in antique shops: the blades are just too blasted expensive. $2.50 per blade isn't sustainable on my current budget unless I take the time to sharpen them when they get dull instead of replacing them (which I don't want to do). I don't expect to find anything that can match the cost of DE blades, but I'd like to be under a dollar a cartridge at least."
crossdressing,3dow00,d89560,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the cartridge refills are a scam.  One thing i do that saves a bit of money is i shave with hair conditioner instead of shaving cream.  Cheaper, a bottle lasts way longer, and doesn't dry your skin out."
crossdressing,3dow00,JerricaNicole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:28:16 2015 UTC,I love them. I am afraid to use them for other things besides my face.
crossdressing,3dow00,Hollied,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:57 2015 UTC,I usually use the disposable lady razors from Target.  Be gentle on yourself when you shave those area other than your face and be sure to exfoliate before and use soothing lotion afterward.  Your skin will thank you later.
crossdressing,3dow00,_stiletto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:46:06 2015 UTC,"I love DSC. I use their 4X and it works great on my legs, underarms, and ""bikini area"". I get new blades ever 2 months, so every 2 weeks I'm on a brand new blade to keep things fresh and smooth. All for $3/mo (Because I space out the orders). I typically shave w/o cream in the shower, but every time I use shaving clean it's just a little bit smoother. Highly recommended.  Not to pander, but if DSC is something you opt to go for, it'd be cool if you use my referral link. Gets you razors, gets me $5 off my next order. If you do it naturally through their website or go for something other than DSC, nothing gained nothing lost! <3"

crossdressing,3dlpsz,Aprilweather,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"It helps to have a little meat on the chest for creating cleavage.  Moobs or whatever you want to call them.  You can force them together and use some medical tape to create the deep looking valley.    I'd also recommend an attachable set of forms, something with a strong adhesive backing that will stay in place.  There are many good options at several sites that sell forms, and ebay/amazon.    As for blending, something I have tried with little success, I would suggest a silicone skin as opposed to a poly-urethane skin.  That way, the make-up blends as opposed to smearing like they do on my poly-skinned forms.    Been thinking about the silicone skinned forms lately though, for that exact reason.  The other option is to blow $1500-$1600 on a set of realbreast forms, they look pretty smooth and easy to make cleveage with."
crossdressing,3dlpsz,level5miniboss,2,Fri Jul 17 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"I have a set of $200 silicone breastforms, and they're great. They feel really natural and sexy, but like everyone says, cleavage isn't what you're going to get with it."
crossdressing,3dlpsz,KieranPole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"They feel AMAZING they are single handedly the best purchase I have ever made maybe next to a proper wig. I had to go get a little help from my neighbour once as I got a zipper stuck (story for another time) and we were just talking about them and I let her feel them and she returned the favour, they are really realistic in size, weight, feel wise they are a bit firmer than real boobs (or at least my neighbours) and they don't provide as much ""Jiggle"" as you'd think but they do bounce a bit.  For making a cleavage do what I do, get a cleavage booster which is like a stick on bra, I got on fairly cheap and it has done me wonders then apply a little bronzer to the cleavage to try and form a curve of boobs. The booster also pushes out your forms a bit and will really make them stand out a bit more :)"

crossdressing,3dimaj,anoncd33,11,Thu Jul 16 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"Quite passable  and I know others may disagree but if you want to blend in, in addition to tucking you may wish to tone down the boobs just a little.  A large rack draws attention which for your public debut may be not what you want  but that is just my option."
crossdressing,3dimaj,Sarahjan,3,Thu Jul 16 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I feel it's more the shape than the size that makes them stand out (pun very intended) in this case. Larger boobs do not stick outward in a cone shape like that, their weight pulls them into a rounder, more tear drop shape and they tend to sit a bit lower, even if wearing a push up style bra.  I would suggest a smaller size and a more natural shape - I was given the same advice early on, and now use a very subtle form (slightly enhanced by the small breasts starting to form underneath) and it looks far more natural than early photos I have of my attempts.  Other than that, looks great!"
crossdressing,3dimaj,decultured,3,Thu Jul 16 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling they might be big. Fun for home dressing, but maybe less so for public."
crossdressing,3dimaj,unixbeardxd,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"I think so.  One caveat though... If you are wanting to pass completely, your tucking game needs to be on-point."
crossdressing,3dimaj,privatecarnage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:26 2015 UTC,Nude or black leggings with a skirt might work better? Or just actual (tight) jeans I suppose.
crossdressing,3dimaj,littlemissfuzzy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"I would make the breasts either smaller or a more natural shape (so they kind of hang down a bit, not quite to the point of ""sagging"", but so that they follow gravity).   I would also perhaps try waxing your eyebrows?  Eyebrow shape can make a huge difference for whether someone passes or not.  If you can't wax them, maybe shape them with an eyebrow pencil?  Only if you reallllllllly know what you're doing though.  Arch them a bit and thin them.   I also recommend bangs!  Not entirely necessary, but they frame faces really nicely and make you look particularly feminine.  I don't think jeggings will be a problem as long as you're passing everywhere else.  No one is going to be staring down at your crotch if they have no reason to suspect anything.  If you're really worried about that, maybe wear pantyhose underneath with the compression top?  You look really pretty :)"

crossdressing,3dimaj,laurenCD415,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"Jeggings don't really hold your parts in, so really focus on that. Also, if you want to keep large breasts an option, round them out, and drop them a little bit. Natural boobs are almost never that perky. A little shaving here and there and no one will really bat an eye."

crossdressing,3dimaj,tinariddle,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:55 2015 UTC,Just buy breast inserts on eBay from user dreamform. You can usually get them for about $20 plus shipping. They come in sizes 4-12 and look much better than rice in pantyhose

crossdressing,3dimaj,DiggingNoMore,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"What I do is I have the bra a little tighter than where girls would have it usually, but still kind of low. I gather as much skin and fat between my armpit and pectoral, as well as beneath it, and I place the padding right there under the gathered mass. Repeat on the other side, and the effect should be the bra pushing on the rice, as the rice pushes  on your skin to create some cleavage. What that also does is round it out by providing more mass under your pectoral and around it, while leaving your natural pectoral to do the rest of the work in filling out the middle."

If you happen upon the jeans photos I post on here, I wear mostly jeggings. First and foremost, Jeans are such a bitch for me and most of us, because A) every brand's sizes are different, and B) Not all of us have the luxury or the confidence to walk into a clothing store to try stuff on. Jeggings makes it easier due to the stretch. Keep in mind though, our boy hips are different than a girls, so you gotta watch for that. If you wear skinny jeans/jeggings, make sure that you tuck properly, otherwise, your junk and/or camel toe will be glaringly obvious.   You started out well here, just play around with looks that you feel comfortable and happy with, we all started somewhere. And you look far better than I did when I started dressing all the way, that's for sure ! Cheers ! =)"

She knew that I dressed as a girl for halloween a couple years in a row and she figured it was something that I would like to do it more often. I am happy that she was fine with it and being a crossdresser. We just went out yesterday and we had a great time went to the mall and tried on clothes and we actually went to a movie also went to a packed restaurant for lunch. It was fun being a girl for about 6 hours in public. I wish I didn't lose my pictures from yesterday or I would post them here. She might come around and she might help you go out in public and have a girls day.

crossdressing,3diym3,way2michelle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard of this option before, sounds potentially messy/leaky. Many people use birdseed or other solids to build breasts"
crossdressing,3diym3,Paula_56,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"One gallon food storage bags that you can buy at the super market, double them up, I've had no problem with leaks.I have breast forms now. Works very real.  another method use the absorbent materiel inside a dsipoable diaper take about a cup of that and put it into a large latex balloon one that can go up 36"" you can get them at any Party store. then add water this feels just like silicon breast forms.  bird seed is not very real."
crossdressing,3diym3,Aprilweather,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"OK these aren't the best, but they do work in a pinch and I used them before I got forms.  Baloons.  Filled with water, but not water baloons if that makes sense.  The ones designed to be thrown by kids at other kids are designed to burst easily and you don't want that.  Just get the ones that are typically designed to hold helium, a whole pack should only cost 2 bucks or so.  Pros: there's a weight and a droop to them, and they do wobble kind of naturally.  Cheap, easily replaceable and discardable.  If someone makes you angry enough, you can throw it at them and soak the sucker.  Cons: They burst kinda easily, even the sturdier variety.  The will not hold their shape as well as silicone or real breasts.  Although they feel and move somewhat natural, again, pales in comparison to good silicone ones.  I have also heard that nylon stockings filled with birdseed, like the stuff you would feed to a parakeet, works well.  No firsthand experience to offer there though."
crossdressing,3diym3,Lady_Fiona,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:32 2015 UTC,I was a fan of rice filled balloons for a while.  I finally decided on how big I'd like to be and pulled the trigger on some forms.  Just wear tops/dresses that cover your chest and you should be fine.
crossdressing,3diym3,_stiletto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"I always go the rolled up socks method. I've never done breast forms to confirm or deny this, but I always feel like they'd get hot and sticky or something. I don't want to ""apply"" them. Getting dressed is enough work, packing a bra with some socks is much easier. Granted, I have to watch how much cleavage a shirt has and make sure a cami is always pulled up high enough, but otherwise it's a fantastic solution for me."

crossdressing,3df59t,Jessica_Red,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"Quick question, do you use a beard trimmer or something like that to trim your leg hair before you shave it? That should help with the destroying razors part if you don't.  Also I'd recommend exfoliating both before AND after. I use the St. Ives sea salt thing and haven't felt any razor burn or bumps or anything. Obviously everyone's different but take that for whatever you think it's worth."
crossdressing,3df59t,DunmerPrincess,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"This.  Whenever I do my legs, I have to pre-shave with an electric grooming razor to shorten the hairs before I finish the job.  Most of the time, I will do the pre-shave one day, then the final shave the next day in order to spread out the time it takes me.  I haven't had the destroyed razor issue as much as I've had the clogged-up-with-hair-razor issue.  However, when the hair I'm shaving is much shorter than before the pre-shave, my razor doesn't get clogged up near as much.  For the most part, I don't exfoliate quite as much as I should, but when I do, I do it beforehand...........and I use the St Ives as well.  Afterward, I use a peppermint lotion that I buy from Whole Foods, which soothes pretty much anything.    Finding the right way to shave down seems different for everyone.  I hope you can find what works for you."
crossdressing,3df59t,Hollied,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:13:27 2015 UTC,I do use a trimmer when it's been a while between shaves but I'll try using it more often and the St. Ives peppermint lotion combo sounds like a win.  Will give it a shot and let you all know how it works n_n

I started shaving my legs occasionally a year ago and started getting bad razor bumps and ingrowns. I stopped shaving for some two months last fall but my legs didn't seem to get any better in that time. So I decided it's better to have a smoother Mordor than hairy one, and continued shaving ;)  Do ingrowns heal miraculously by themselves if I stop shaving now?

crossdressing,3ddiqn,crossbabe123,10,Wed Jul 15 12:39:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I know of no one for whom therapy has helped them stop cross dressing.  I've known plenty who work on acknowledging that part of your psyche and accepting that it is how you are, and to come up with strategies for dealing with the dysphoria or other feelings.  It's one of those things that can be repressed and cause depression and anxiety further down the road.  Honestly, I know no one who was ""cured"" of cross dressing that didn't develop other problems later.  Best of luck if this is what you want to do though, it won't be an easy road."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,unixbeardxd,6,Wed Jul 15 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"The only thing that a good therapist would do is help you to accept yourself as a crossdresser. No ethical therapist would attempt to ""cure"" you. There is nothing wrong with being a crossdresser and it is not something you can or should fix. Trying to do so will just cause you more pain. Please consider a healthier route by coming to terms with who you are, regardless of what your sister thinks. If she really does love you, she will support you."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,LukeWarm92,2,Wed Jul 15 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"Came here to say exactly this.  See a therapist if you want, OP, but what you should be working on is self-acceptance."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,pancakeonmyhead,2,Wed Jul 15 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"I have said this many time to many people; it is only clothes. The human you are inside is who you are.  Do you run  down the street ripping clothes off other women so you can wear them? Probably not, so what harm are you doing  to anyone.  I am a male, I am a cross dresser (really more of a fetishist) but none the less,  I love to dress up and act a role and have fun.  I like females, I may have a bit of a bi side and an open mind , but my head turns for women.  Cross dressing is just a bunch of fun that harms no  one,  so have fun,  embrace it, enjoy it when you can and let it runs its path in your life.  It is only clothes.  You can cover yourself with mud, but the person underneath does not change."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,archangel7164,2,Thu Jul 16 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sure no one will be offended and that's your choice regarding what do you think is best to do about it.  The question is, are you happy when you cross dress? Does it make you feel better or are you feeling like you don't want it all and will never need it? Cuz there's a difference there. Because if you feel good about it, it might be healthier to do what makes you feel good even of society dictates otherwise. If the therapist is good he'll try to convince you that it's ok and is part of your personality ratherk than try to change your nature.  Best of luck to you, regardless of your decision."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,Alexa-Doll,3,Wed Jul 15 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"Really good comments have been made here and I just want to add that being straight puts you in the vast majority of crossdressers. There is a stereotype that crossdressing is a primarily gay thing, which is completely inaccurate and based on 1. the relative prominence of drag queens, which is a totally different thing; and 2. the offensive notion that a man who is attracted to other men must not be much of a man at all. In my experience almost every man who crossdresses does so with a simultaneous sexual attraction to women/femininity and often it is in fact related to their reasons for wanting to dress."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,DunmerPrincess,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:37 2015 UTC,Ask your sister to read this: http://cdwives.blogspot.ca/2015/05/you-are-not-alone.html She will understand you are not the only straight male who likes to have a femme persona now and then.
crossdressing,3ddiqn,Diane60CD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"straight male who likes to have a femme persona    Heck, a lot of us don't even assume a persona and just love the clothes ( ^_^)"
crossdressing,3ddiqn,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to add my experience to what others are already saying.  Crossdressing is a part of my identity, part of the core of who  I am.  You could no sooner get me to stop wearing (and especially wanting to wear) feminine clothing & makeup than you could change my sexual orientation.   What has worked for me, is years of talk therapy and open & honest communication with my wife that lets me indulge this part of me in a way that's healthy and doesn't deny my wife of her right to have me as the husband she married.  If she had told me to simply stop being a crossdresser we would have gotten divorced long ago.  This is nothing to be ashamed of!  I'm very proud of who I am and open & willing to talk about it with anyone who has questions.  Not everyone has been receptive of it but generally people are positive and curious about it at most.    In short, yes definitely seek a therapist who specializes in gender / crossdressing identity issues but don't waste your time going in with the mindset that they'll get you to stop.  Instead you need to start thinking about the healthiest way you can live your life with this."
crossdressing,3ddiqn,d89560,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"she would want me to stop though because she cares about me and doesnt want people to make fun and judge me.   Careful there, sometimes suppressing feelings out of fear of being judged backfires. Do you really care about what random people on the street think?  Even though crossdressing in public is unusual, it doesn't generally lead to more than stares. Tell your sister I think she's overreacting."

crossdressing,3dd933,_stiletto,2,Wed Jul 15 10:42:28 2015 UTC,"Also I haven't really given too much thought to +1 guidelines. Meeting people from the internet can be weird, and going out crossdressing (especially as a first) can be terrifying, so on one hand it'd be nice to be able to bring a +1. On the other, the point is #1 to have a chance to dress up in a safe crowd of people, and #2 to meet and interact with those people. So long as your +1 is cool with us, if you want the support then go ahead and bring them.  On a related note: Meeting people from the internet is totally weird. Doing that while crossdressed is totally weirder. Though I'd understand people wanting to tackle those one at a time by showing up NOT crossdressed, then maybe attending future meetups dressed up, I'd place a strong preference on people going the extra mile to make this a really special, recurring event. It takes some serious balls to do what we do ;) Look at my flair. Embrace it <3 Be you for the night!"

crossdressing,3dcbvv,DressesAreManly,2,Wed Jul 15 03:58:57 2015 UTC,"I would vote for yes. I came out to everyone I know on Facebook a few weeks ago, it was a great feeling and the response was far more positive/enthusiastic than I would have expected. I posted a detailed account of how it went down if you want to read it. Everyone's situation is different of course and I wouldn't presume to say what worked for me works for everyone. But if you are reasonably confident that your family/friends are going to be okay with it (even if there is a bit of initial confusion, which is understandable), I would say go for it. You will feel much better not having to keep a part of you a secret. And plus you can feel good about doing something to be visible and help break down the idea that this is weird or dangerous or wrong."

crossdressing,3dcbvv,Mandi_Mischief,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:44 2015 UTC,"God damnit you just reminded me of the time in Middle School when the two girls my male friend and I were out with dared us to do a full crossdressing thing and because I wasn't even CLOSE to out of the closet yet I had to machismo my way into a No.  Thanks for dredging up that repressed memory -_- <3  Anyways, coming out is a totally personal decision that needs to correspond to    The role you want Crossdressing to have in your life How comfortable you are with that role/how well you've ""Accepted yourself"" Your personal social or family environment   It took years of mental preparation and coming to terms with myself and learning about myself before I was ready to come out of the closet. If you do want to come out, there are a couple things working in your favor, as there has literally never been a better time to come out with ANYTHING that falls under the LGBTQ umbrella than right now, with Caitlyn Jenner's coming out and the recent SCOTUS ruling on Gay Marriage.  Since it was your mom making the ""This would look great on you"" jokes, it clearly shows that she hasn't completely dismissed the idea as ridiculous. Granted, that idea coming to fruition is a totally different experience, but you'd never see ultra hardcore religious rightwing mom make a joke about putting ""her little boy"" in a dress.  I have no idea how old you are, so maybe this is something best left until College or later, or at least until you're 18, but being able to start exploring that now might be very beneficial to your growth. More importantly, being able to talk about it will give you vast amounts of knowledge and self-awareness."

crossdressing,3dbkk8,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:45:30 2015 UTC,Yeah and they're usually downvoted pretty quickly. A person doing a digital makeover is not crossdressing. They've put forth no effort to clothe themselves or apply makeup. They took a selfie and let the phone do all the work. There aren't rules against it but the community has already made its opinion known.

So how is that not crossdressing? I for one don't even try to pass, have a beard and only do my nails. Wear cute dresses and other girly clothes. Not CD?"

Upon further reading of my original comment, my compliments to the dress and shoes would show that I am, in fact, aware that aforementioned digital makeover by OP eclipses the 10% of submitters who put forth effort.  It's not cross dressing when someone takes a selfie of their face and applies digital makeup. If you do your nails and wear cute dresses then yeah that's cross dressing.

Everything beard and south gets a shave/nair/epilator. Then out comes the light-duty shapewear, medical tape, corset (Which no longer fits right), breast forms and bra, stockings and garter belt... Fingers and toes get nail polish, skater dress, heels, makeup, wig.  Sure, it takes a couple hours and I'm plum tuckered out by the end of it, but even my wife thinks I look good, and she's 99.5% straight... And no, the .5% is not femme me."
crossdressing,3d94mc,unixbeardxd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:19:39 2015 UTC,⬆⬆⬆⬆This! As femme as is humanly possible.
crossdressing,3d94mc,StacyLeeUrbanTaylor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Almost no one's 100% straight. Almost no straight person wants to admit it.  But yes, as girly as possible."
crossdressing,3d94mc,MeHoney,8,Tue Jul 14 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"for me I need to do all or nothing. I can't simply put on shoes and a dress, because then i simply feel like a guy in a dress.  I need to  start from the ground up and go through an entire transformation, full gender change."
crossdressing,3d94mc,TheWizardKara,3,Tue Jul 14 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, when I'm a guy I want to be a guy; when I'm a girl, I have to be full on girl. That means completely shaven all over, makeup, hair, breastforms, hip and buttpads, and perfume. The whole 9 yards. It's hard, time consuming and initially expensive, but totally worth it."
crossdressing,3d94mc,level5miniboss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:48 2015 UTC,Samesies. Shaving is a requirement. I will try my darndest to remove every bit of me that doesn't say girl. :)
crossdressing,3d94mc,0rangeJuic3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:38 2015 UTC,all or nothing. i hate anyone seeing me half way between each. it's a very very vulnerable time for me. when it's all finished though i find a new confidence.
crossdressing,3d94mc,TheWizardKara,2,Tue Jul 14 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Seconded. I know a lot of CD's like to ""underdress"" and that's never held any appeal for me at all. Like you said, all or nothing."

If I'm leaving the house to walk around in heels it's all or nothing. As you stated, I don't want to cast the impression of being a ""guy in a dress."" For me, if I'm drawing stares, I want it to be for all the effort I did put in to my makeup and the outfit."
crossdressing,3d94mc,_stiletto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:19:09 2015 UTC,I will admit I did go to a mall once with high heel boots under guy clothes. It was a nervous experience and not one I wanna repeat

But I agree, when I'm dressing up I need to go 100%--clothes, makeup, wig, forms, heels, shaved, and flirty :)"

crossdressing,3d94mc,StacyLeeUrbanTaylor,2,Tue Jul 14 22:23:15 2015 UTC,"I only go all out about once or twice a month, and it feels so amazing when everything comes together. But sometimes when I'm alone I'll just put on a skirt and camisole for comfort and play around with eyeliner. I find most women's clothes more interesting and comfortable than men's clothes, so I like to wear them even if I'm not all dolled up."
crossdressing,3d94mc,AlpacaJess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:13:25 2015 UTC,I actually feel feminine really easily. If I'm just wearing heels or some dangly earrings I already feel great. But that makes it all the more amazing to do the whole shebang! The one thing I haven't tried yet is perfume but I'll be sure to once I get the chance!
crossdressing,3d94mc,ana07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"I consider my style more androgynous than girly, mostly because my face and body are both still very masculine even when I'm presenting in a feminine way, which I like. I make it work and it looks nice imo."
crossdressing,3d94mc,janinso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:30:15 2015 UTC,"I only recently started cross dressing (3 months), but people have always questioned my sexually and/or gender role, even my ex-wife. I have always been the blurred line between the 2. So I have no real way to tell. I think the attitude just comes from the situation I am in and what is ""needed"" or fits well. I am never really self conscious of my actions in that regards, mostly because I genuinely do not care what other think about me. I am me, deal with it.  I cross dress in public and I openly let people know I do so. I do it as a form of activism. I find it appalling that it is even an issue that needs to be made a big deal of. The only way to get people to see it as normal, is to make them see it."
crossdressing,3d94mc,DreamQuixotic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:54 2015 UTC,"I always go all out.

crossdressing,3d6p41,Plaidskirtgurl,2,Mon Jul 13 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"By request of @Speada's comment, I will tell a bit of a story. Many years ago, I started exploring some feminine expressions through crossdressing as a form of kinky sex play. It was fun, but was merely the entry point into something that was about identity, not sex. I have been slowly dressing more and more just to be myself in my home with my family. I would write, edit films, read books about gender philosophy and just enjoy a part of me that I didn't understand until fairly recently.  I had gone out to a trans-friendly gay-bar a couple times to dance with peers, but nobody really cares, nobody really sees you there, and I still felt like I was, ""hiding""...   So these photos were taken after months of thinking about it, fearing it, and making excuses to avoid it. I kept thinking, I should organize something with my cd/trans friends, or I should make plans to go out with my partner and child, and then it finally hit me a few days before, I'm a fucking adult, this is my adventure, I need to own it, Do it.  My goal was to make this a, ""slow pitch"", just to get an easy victory. So I cruised around town a bit and found a quiet little spot of shade beneath a tree. I could be seen from a distance, that was intentional, as a pretty girl in a dress by herself in the woods is a bit... you know... But I was far enough to feel comfortable. I didn't speak to anyone, I just relaxed and took it easy.  My neighbor might have seen me driving when I pulled in, but whatever, I just can't keep giving a shit.  It is a step I needed to make, I'm way too self conscious about my gender identity, I just want to be me, and being less than is becoming more taxing than coasting as cis-gender identifying.  Thank you all for the support and kind words, it was a great experience and if anyone needs advice or encouragement to be more visible or authentic in whatever way that works for them, please don't hesitate to reach out, you are not alone."

crossdressing,3d4pr0,_stiletto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"Well you certainly get to try easymode (like me!) with your body. That outfit you built is exactly what you need to be doing: Creating curve around the hip/waist. You might want to try lighter colors below your waist because darker colors make things look shorter, whereas lighter colors make things appear longer, and it might flatter you to lengthen your legs. Conversely, trying to reduce the breadth of your shoulders (The reason I always wear shirts with sleeves) could give you some additional help.  Regardless, I think you look great! Love the outfit! It's very well put together! Hope to see more :)"

Even women are watched in public, so one cannot avoid that for the moment. However, one also gets positive feedback. At work etc it is no longer a topic, many people like it. I approached this state slowly, first with kilts. Today I will wear anything -- it should be elegant. Most important is your attitude. Best wishes."

crossdressing,3d56rg,thubtop,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! It takes courage first, later it is only fun.  I wore a summer dress today and had to shower in a men's dressing room but I don't care -- although this is relatively my least favorable place. Later i ate at my usual Turkish buffet where I am always well received.. Before I was at work. BTW, while riding a bicycle barely anybody notices -- or reacts.   Last week a woman showed me photos of her cross dressing friends. I like such  happenings."
crossdressing,3d56rg,DeeDeeInDC,3,Thu Jul 16 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say it like this, and some may not agree with me... but I don't think there's any way for any man who HASN'T had some kind of surgery to ""pass"" in public. (maybe another exception would be if someone under 16 cross-dressed, they might still have the per-pubescent body to pull it off) People, especially women, are going to know the truth as soon as you enter a certain proximity. -and I don't even count if you talk or not. The male figure is impossible to conceal with only clothes and makeup, therefore, I would say if you like the way you look in the mirror, go for it. If you REALLY feel self-conscious, well, have a female friend give you pointers. I do it all the time. She'll be pretty honest and tell you how close you get. I mean, really, there isn't a way for a non-modified man to pass as a women. It's a goal that is unattainable and if you keep worrying about how close you are, it will just feel all the more out of reach. This was a lesson I quickly learned and ever since I accepted it, I have felt less bothered about it. The ""line"" is also without a hard definition. It's basically limited only by your own imagination and ability to free yourself from the opinions of others. I admit I still wonder if every person that walks by me thinks ""that's totally a GUY in a DRESS"" but you know what, it's not my fault male and female fashion standards fell into place before I was born. I think so long as you continue to radiate confidence you'll be fine."
crossdressing,3d56rg,amberontheinside,3,Mon Jul 13 17:14:33 2015 UTC,"See, I don't want to pass. I have no desire to pass. I do not want to conceal my masculinity. I want to wear sexy, fun, colorful, clothes that reveal more than a pair of board shorts. I agree with you, it's not my fault fashion standards are this way. I do not want to wear the same knee length shorts as everyone else, why can't a guy wear a bright orange skirt and a triangle top?   I guess my concern,  If I am breaking society norms by wearing female clothing as a male Who Says I have to follow society norms by trying to be a woman when I am a man.  Why Can't a man wear women's clothing, while still being a man?   Nevermind, I found what I was searching for.  Going to the beach tonight!  I don't care if someone says that's a man in a woman's bikini, dress,skirt, whatever."

crossdressing,3d56rg,_stiletto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"ahh, ok, I misinterpreted that. Well, isn't this what the women's slutwalk is all about, being able to wear what you want in public without being harassed or judged? I'm not sure, but it seems like so long as don't think you'll get arrested of indecent exposure, you're fine."
crossdressing,3d56rg,DeeDeeInDC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"I believe the Slutwalk, is a reference to sexual violence. Being told ""don't dress like sluts you won't get raped"". Essentially you can wear whatever you want but that doesn't mean you are asking to be raped/abused/assaulted.   Yea I don't have any issues covering everything up.

You haven't really given the right photo for anyone to really tell if you would pass, unless you walk around posing like that :p which might be suspicious.   You absolutely have what it takes to pass, (jealooous) but first thing I noticed is your eye make up is a little bottom-heavy. Perhaps try only applying liner to the waterline on the bottom if at all, and only at the outer half of each eye. Maybe a little more on the top outside corner with a bit of a wing. This should lift your eyes a bit and look more feminine.  I think the only other things holding you back is just a little tidiness with your wig and brows, your hairstyle is cool but it could definitely be tidied up, and I can't see your brows properly but probably just a clean-up as well.  Body/outfit is on point. You can totally pass with a little practice, but remember it's more important to feel good about how you look than to appease society. :) Good luck girl xx"

They were meant for my younger sister, but they fit girls my age. In the bag were a couple of denim skirts. When I had the house to myself, I of course tried them on and was hooked.   That's a long way of saying denim skirts are cute, and hold a nostalgic place in my heart. You look cute!"

crossdressing,3d11bj,bsb2001ca,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie - I probably don't take as good care of it as I should, but I've had it for about 6 months now and it's still in good condition. You're supposed to hang them up when not in use, but sometimes I have to keep it folded up and hidden in a box. And you're supposed to wash them after every use, but sometimes I have to put it away quickly without the time to do that. And finally, I don't use actual latex polish, but rather the dressing aid lubricant that can double as polish (but something designed to be polish would probably be better).  That said, I just give it a wash with warm soapy water every now and then and use a dressing aid lubricant to shine it. Any seam-breaking is super easy to fix (a dab of rubber cement), though actual tears would probably be harder and so I'm careful not to stretch it in a way that it might tear."

crossdressing,3d13en,DunmerPrincess,2,Sun Jul 12 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"Heck yeah. I can't leave the house in girl mode unless I am immaculate. As a guy, I can go days without a shave and unkempt. It is more than just passing, it is a defense mechanism. I know that many won't care, but if I get the wrong kind of attention, I won't be able to defend myself."
crossdressing,3d13en,unixbeardxd,4,Sun Jul 12 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there's two things there, if you unpack that a little:   In general, society permits men a degree of slovenlinesscomfort that it's not as willing to extend to women.  Women get judged rather harshly if they go out looking ""not put together"", whereas men don't. For many CDs and transwomen, ""passing"" as a cis-girl is a matter of direct physical safety.  Fail to pass, and you may be subject to assault or even murder--trans people get murdered just for being trans.  And looking ""put together"" helps you pass."
crossdressing,3d13en,pancakeonmyhead,2,Sun Jul 12 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"Trust me, sister, you're not alone.  There are lots of cis-girls that struggle to get out there unless they look perfect.  It's called self-consciousness and it's normal.  I also agree that it can be a sort of a defense mechanism for some as well.  As for me, I can relate in the sense that, guy or girl, I don't like doing things half-assed (no offense meant to anyone with differing opinions) and will only step out as Hollie when I feel like I am all put together and I like how I look.  In male mode, I do put effort into myself, but it doesn't seem to take as much effort for me to feel all put together in male mode as it does in female mode.  We keep plugging away, however, and we cherish those moments when we take that one glance at ourselves and say, ""DAMN, I look good!"" As hard as I can be on myself, I try to do that at least once whenever I dress..........I guess it's my own validation.   I am going in for a makeup lesson at one of those transformation type places on Friday so hopefully that will be a good next step.    This is great!  I'm so excited for you!  I might also suggest doing a full makeover at Sephora (free if you spend $50 there) or at a BareMinerals boutique (also free).  They will work their magic AND give you lessons.  They will also write up a template of what they did and the product they used as well.  I have learned a great deal from my two makeover experiences (one from each place).  The most important thing afterward is practice, practice, practice.    Happy dressing!"
crossdressing,3d13en,Hollied,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"I had similar emotions about a month ago. I felt like no matter how hard I tried to be feminine, I'd always look like a guy in makeup. While in that negative headspace, I'd start imagining my friends mocking me, my family being embarrassed, and my girlfriend wishing I was manlier. It sucked.  I took a break and realized that I was judging myself based on trans or cis women and very talented crossdressers instead of my own progress. I've been doing this for less than a year, but I think that each time I put on makeup or put together an outfit, I look a little better. And since I don't plan to live as a woman, whether or not I pass doesn't have to impact my day-to-day life. I also have support online and offline. My girlfriend and the handful of friends who know my secret are accepting, which is great. Also, when I did get back into it after a few weeks, just putting on a skirt made me smile.   Taking a break really gave me some perspective. I don't know how strong your urge to dress is, so your mileage may vary.  Have a great time at the transformation salon! I'm planning to go to one later this year."
crossdressing,3d13en,AlpacaJess,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"Also a note re: jealousy. Sometimes I see people post on here looking completely fabulous and of course it's impossible not to feel a twinge of it, but I'm generally pretty good at getting past that because 1. I know this person has a strong need to crossdress just like me and it's fairly easy to convert that feeling into being happy for them because I truly do empathize with everyone here, and 2. like I said before I know I'm far from mastering makeup and I still have legitimate hope that I can get to a level like that if I keep working hard at it.  But what absolutely kills me is when I see another guy who I know has facial features that would make him amazing at this if he wanted to do it but almost certainly is part of the 99+% of the male population who doesn't give a fuck and in fact probably wishes he looked more masculine.   Like, for instance. This is a ridiculous thing to bring up but whatever. There was this shortlived reality show on TBS about 10 years ago called ""He's a Lady."" The premise was that a group of guys thinking they would be competing on some kind of all-American manly man contest were, in fact, going to compete at, essentially, crossdressing. The show would probably never be made today as presenting men embodying femininity as an embarrassing spectacle is offensive to transwomen not to mention crossdressers but anyway. Most of the guys had pretty burly hyper-masculine body types/faces and therefore were not very convincing. But there was one named Albert (aka Alberta) who looked SO GOOD. Even though at times he did seem to get kind of into it (they were competing for a quarter million dollars after all), at one point he said that the process was ""close to my worst nightmare."" I mean, I would kill to look like Albert and he not only didn't care, he actively hated it.   Of course this feeling is not very different from what all kinds of people feel about all kinds of different things all the time. There are not very many people who aren't their harshest critic and find all kinds of flaws in their own appearance that others don't see. I'm not trying to say that crossdressing is totally exceptional, although the gender illusion/""passing"" element is a fairly unique wrinkle. But it's still so weird to find myself in this emotional place again because of it when it's been largely absent from my life otherwise lately."
crossdressing,3d13en,AlpacaJess,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. I remember that show. The only thing more offensive than its attitude towards crossdressing were those horrid sweatsuits they always wore. :p  I felt the same about Albert(a). The chance to have a bunch of professionals help me crossdress for a six-figure prize would be a dream come true for me, and there he was, living my dream and hating every minute of it."
crossdressing,3d13en,anoncd33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I also recently started dressing and am still trying to figure out clothes and makeup most of all. I also have an obsessive type of personality and feel that if I'm doing something, I may as well do it the best that I can. I have not gone out in Public yet, but may soon if I think I can at least somewhat pass."

crossdressing,3cyocd,Booty_hoe_2000,5,Sat Jul 11 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"Ensure you are doing a hot towel compress before your shave. If you are not already do a second pass with the shave again with the hot towel compress. Personally I shave with and against the grain (there are a lot of folks who get all sorts of butt hurt about that but for me it really helps - try it); so in essence my first shave is with the grain, the second pass is against it. Once both passes are complete I perform a cold water compress - the hot water opens your pores, the cold closes them. I always moisturize (never after shave) afterward and let that soak in before makeup. Honestly outside of laser hair removal this is  about as close a shave as you can get. Some gals here also make a pass with an electric shaver with some success. Hope this helps."
crossdressing,3cyocd,jenna_cd,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"I do almost the same thing, minus the hot towel before. I take a long warm shower beforehand so it probably has the same effect. (AKA luv2cross)"

crossdressing,3cyocd,MistyLuv,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:45:06 2015 UTC,Stubble will always be present no matter how much. Over one night it can get quite annoying. There is for some black specks inside the pores with the hair which makes the stubble darker  which can be pushed out like pimples.  What I do is pluck the hair with a tweezer after letting it grow for a night or two.

crossdressing,3cwoth,ElizaRei,5,Sat Jul 11 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"People here are defending the crossdressing, but you already said you're fine with that. And that's the good part!  Now the very bad part is, that he cheated on you. There's nothing right about that and people saying it's somehow ok because he was embarrassed are wrong. You didn't do anything wrong if it's like you described. Crossdressing is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about, and people doing shit like this only makes it harder for other crossdressers.   I don't think he's gay, since you say you have a healthy sex life. He might be bisexual, but it can be the same as me, that he's only attracted to femininity. Although he can't give you a reason for the cd-ing, I feel like you can ask him why he went behind your back, and ask him what he wants with your relationship after you thought about what you want. The most important thing is to just talk about it as open as you both can."
crossdressing,3cwoth,ElizaRei,0,Sat Jul 11 14:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna call my partner peter so as not to confuse you in my reply. I talked to him a bit about crossdressing and he said as far as he was aware nobody knew and it had been a secret all his life and that he could go for very long periods without dressing up but he said the internet opened up a whole new world to him, I think he only spoke to other male cds and eventually arranged a meet, he said he had arranged a few before but one or the other chickened out. He drove up to this mans apartment after work, peter said that the other fella wanted to get dressed up and that peter stay as a man, peter went along with this and had sex with the man and he said when it was over he felt awful and even though he came he didn't enjoy it???? He says he went looking on same web site a few months later and same man looking so he says at least it was going to be safe, no fear of being jumped or beaten up and he went up again and brought his own clothes but again the other man didnt want peter to dress up so he put on peters clothes and changed a few times, peter performed oral on other man he says he didnt enjoy it. Peter tells me it's all about the clothes but he wasn't wearing them, which surely a crossdressing encounter is about? peter getting dressed up? he was being unfaithful as plain him, i don't see how he wants to be with a woman when he's dressed when it was only men he sought.Thanks for answering me i'm really confused i thought we we're really happy. We have  children so i have to try and get my head around this because no matter what i have  to look at this man for another 10+ years"
crossdressing,3cwoth,jawide626,0,Sat Jul 11 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"In my eyes it doesnt matter whether he was unfaithful dressed like a girl or as a boy. The thing is, clothes dont change who you are as much as some would like to. He's still Peter when he's dressed as a girl.  It seems to me he wanted to have sex dressed up but there other guys didn't want to for some reason. I don't know the specifics of their arrangement, but a meeting between two crossdressers is the same as between any other two people. Meeting up doesn't have to be sexual, sometimes it's just to hang out together as friends. He obviously looked for sex though, and it's not just about clothes, clothing don't change what or who you like.  It's possible it's something he isn't interested in sharing with you, and that's fine as long as he doesn't cheat. I know the crossdressing muddles this all a bit but please try to approach as him cheating, and deal with the crossdressing later, cding is not an excuse to go off and do whatever you want."
crossdressing,3cwoth,xdresssarah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me, i'm trying to understand things more before i talk to him again. That's my take on things that he doesn't want to share the cding with me, he said it's all about the clothes that he has no interest in men dressed as men he did show me some of his clothes but i think more to validate his story.And i would also like to say that i don't necessarily believe all he says. Thanks again for talking to me i think you're right when you say deal with the cheating because the cding  hasn't much to do with it and can't be used as an excuse to be a cheating creep."
crossdressing,3cwoth,meappr01,2,Sat Jul 11 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"my girlfriend found out about my CD-ing in a way i didn't want her too as well (again she was snooping in my phone and found a couple of pics) and after a bir of a weird argumenty night she ended up ok with it and whatnot. I explained the why's and all that as much as i could, but in the end the ultimate reason i could explain it by was ""it just feels right and comfortable"" so your partner is probably the same, most CD-ers will probably testify that it just feels comfortable, some of us get a sexual kick out of it at the same time, some don't. If you have a healthy sex life and he has been with guys then it sounds like he's almost certainly bisexual, which is no crime... the fact he didn't tell you may be the same reason i didn't tell my partner of 5 years initially, embarrassment and lack of right situation or words. I can testify i REALLY wanted to tell her, but i could never find the right situation or words really. sometimes you have to take one step back to go two steps forward. I know how you're feeling, and i know how he's feeling and in my opinion, even if you suspect otherwise, believe what he's said and go from there. Involve his CD side in your bedroom if you want, perhaps even try pegging with yo in sexy undies if you think that's what he'd like. I'm REALLY REALLY lucky that my gf is accepting of my CD side, but is also very accepting of my bi/gay side and has given permission for me to have safe sex with other guys, the flipside being she's also bi and has my permission to go have her girl-on-girl fun if and when she wants. but all that is beside the point, i get that you're pissed, it's very understandable, my advice would be just to sit down and talk about where you go from here, i get cheating is just not on, but i also get that he probably was looking for something you don't have... but as i said, if you, say, got a strap-on and are adventurous in the bedroom then you'll be a perfect partner to him and he won't be going anywhere else when all he has is at home."
crossdressing,3cwoth,oox8ue0G,2,Sat Jul 11 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"First of all thanks for the reply and I feel I have to make clear that I wasn't snooping in his phone, he put his phone in my hand to show me a video of a family thing and a message came in at that time that i could see, i am not a snoop. I feel I can never take him back because he cheated on me and male or  female it's cheating and if i had him back i feel it would turn me into a phone checking phscyo bitch and that's not who i am, we have been together for nearly 20 years and i thought we could talk about anything but he said he felt embarrassed about telling me and i get that but i don't get him being with someone else. I know i would of given it my best shot with his cd side given the chance, sex and sexual satisfaction is very important to me so would assume the same of others. I've always been wiling to experiment. He has a need i cant satisfy and I'd be into monogamy as i said game for anything if just the two of us but I have no desire for an open relationship. But i think your right about him be bi"
crossdressing,3cwoth,oox8ue0G,2,Sat Jul 11 15:00:35 2015 UTC,I recently told a friend that i crossdress. she understood and is encouraging it. But the fear of people not accepting you is very real for most of us. she doesnt understand why i didnt tell her before. She's a good friend and we've known each other for a year or so. It's a hard thing to come to terms with. for me at least. The scariest thing is when i get a girlfriend (because i am straight) she might not accept me. It happens and that fear is what keeps people from telling others.
crossdressing,3cwoth,Honeybud_Reese,2,Sat Jul 11 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"This is what is so frustrating about kink thing (either CDing, Fetishes, BDSM, or other kinks) and one person of a marriage does not clearly state what they like to the other person. The majority with those with the kink will go outside of the marriage to find fulfillment in their kink. I use to be that way until I told my wife what I truly liked.  She is okay with it. So here are two major things I see, first the TRUST is destroyed. Two, the high risk of some sort of diseases being brought into the household. You might want to get tested.   The cheating part is the where things cannot be fixed. If he would have opened up to you about the CDing, you might be in a better position."
crossdressing,3cwoth,Honeybud_Reese,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:23:17 2015 UTC,I agree with you in what you are saying he should have been honest but it's hard and i get that. The trust is gone forever the more people i talk to the more i realize is a trust/cheating issue and he hoped the cding would make it justifiable.And being tested was one of my first thoughts i have made an appointment to do so.
crossdressing,3cwoth,Kongmanshow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"There's a saying in Dutch: Trust comes on foot and goes by horse.  I'm afraid I have no practical advice here, other than communication to work out if the trust can ever be rebuilt. Without trust, anything else is going to be seriously complicated.  Good luck."
crossdressing,3cwoth,MeHoney,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:30:52 2015 UTC,"He was telling a load of lies in hope of sorting things out. I felt he wasn't telling the whole truth and I was right, it's been going on for 7years and he says he has met 10+ men but is only admitting to having sex with two of them, but the biggest shock is he never used a condom so has left me at risk of who knows what."
crossdressing,3cwoth,MeHoney,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. It sounds like you started digging and every time more stuff came out and at each step he made up more lies to avoid you digging deeper. Have you reached the bottom yet? You have to make clear that if he wants any hope of forgiveness he has to stop the lying and confess everything.  What happens next depends on what each of you wants. Everything can be saved, if you both want it to. Except perhaps the blind trust of love. There are different levels of trust: do you trust him to take care of your children, do you trust him enough to loan him money, do you trust him not to steal things? There are all sort of ways to the future and since this isn't really crossdressing related perhaps /r/relationships is more appropriate.  I wish you a lot of strength for the future."
crossdressing,3cwoth,Alexa-Doll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for answering but i'm done with him. up until a week ago i trusted him with my life now i don't know. I don't think he's a threat to the children he's just a slimy cheating creep and crossdressing has nothing to do with it, he was just using it to try and justify being a sleaze."
crossdressing,3cwoth,_stiletto,2,Mon Jul 13 07:44:57 2015 UTC,"Crossdressing does not necessarily mean that he is gay, and since the two of you are having sex, he is most likely not. Wearing women's clothes can be incredibly embarrasing to a man, it can be accompanied by feelings of guilt, and fear that, if the truth were to come out, it would mean rejection even by family and friends. It seems like your man made some wrong choices, which could have been born out of desperation or (misplaced) fear of rejection."

crossdressing,3cpncu,Lady_Fiona,3,Thu Jul 9 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. I used to use the strongest antiperspirant I could find and i still had sweat dripping out of my armpits (gross). It was just a mixture of antiperspirant goo and hair. It wasn't getting onto the skin where it needs to be.  I trimmed for awhile to get the skin more used to contact with itself and then started shaving it. I use almost no antiperspirant now (like one click of the stick spread among both sides) and I stay dry and its just so much nicer. If they do sweat, it is a bit more noticeable to the skin but it also dries up fast because there is no hair for it to be stuck in."

Instead of getting her to do it for me, I brought my own stuff and she walked me through how to put on some basic makeup so I could do it at home. She just told me what to do and I applied it.  I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. It's a relief, I've been trying for so long to learn makeup but my depression makes it extremely hard to learn. Whenever I made a mistake I basically had a breakdown. But now that I know I can do it I'm not afraid to keep trying and get better.  I even went out into town dressed like that.

crossdressing,3cmv6w,anoncd33,8,Thu Jul 9 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"link: http://imgur.com/a/hy9ND  So I only started dressing a few months ago. I did it a few times when I was much younger and then basically stopped. But I did dress up for Halloween about 10 years ago. I feel like I've taken some big steps in a short time such as going out to a thrift shop by myself and actually trying things on. I also told my wife right away and she wasn't thrilled, but just told me to do what I gotta do. I was thinking of going out in public soon as well if I think I can pass. I also think I did too much reading on reddit and the internet thinking I was trans, but I think I have come to the conclusion that that is not the case. I feel like I'm venting a little and very nervous but it feels good to get some of this off my chest."

crossdressing,3cnikn,laethin,3,Thu Jul 9 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"It is not weird, it's how a lot of us started out.   These days I use a pre-shaped bra, which by itself arranges for a nice slight breast shape. This photograph is of me wearing said bra under a normal t-shirt. It's not a huge result 'cause it's an unstuffed 80A (EUR size), but it works for me :)"
crossdressing,3cnikn,littlemissfuzzy,3,Thu Jul 9 13:26:11 2015 UTC,You're asking if a crossdresser wearing something to give the illusion of breasts is weird? That's one of the least weird things I can imagine!
crossdressing,3cnikn,DunmerPrincess,2,Thu Jul 9 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"That's kinda par for the course.  Women's clothing, off the rack, is typically made for between a B and a C cup, sometimes up to a D.  Without tits or an analogue, the clothing just doesn't drape right.  Here are a couple ideas for you if you can't afford to splash out on breast forms.   Use the bra size calculator at http://www.brasizecalculator.tk/ to determine your band size.  A male torso will sometimes be a band size higher and a cup size smaller than the calculator shows.  All that matters for you is getting the right band size.  Once you know your proper size, eBay.  I am a fatty, and I fit snugly in a 36B without any enhancement.   DIY breast forms.     Fill nylon stockings with rice.  One bra cup size is equal to roughly 200ml, each side.  Once made, it will deform easily, so full-coverage, padded bras  and high-necked outfits are a must. There are other DIY breast forms out there, my favourite is taking a mix of the fake worms you get in a fishing shop, blending them, adding dih soap, and sealing the slurry in a plastic bag, tying a knot that goes where your nipple would be.  Use microporous medical tape, and tape your nipples together.  It'll create cleavage but not volume."
crossdressing,3cnikn,unixbeardxd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:37:42 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha, wow that second tip :D Holy heck mate you go the extra mile."
crossdressing,3cnikn,littlemissfuzzy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:43:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that second tip came from a website for helping women who had a mastectomy to treat breast cancer, but could not afford a prosthetic to replace what had been lost.  Sobering, I know.  I now own a pair of silicone breast forms, that actually need to be replaced. Trying to find a decent pair through Ali Express that doesn't cost more to ship than the sale price, and is suitable for a 38 year old woman is tough."
crossdressing,3cnikn,unixbeardxd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:08:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that. You're right, it's a sobering thought. I'm in CD for fun and comfort as the tagline says, but it's good to be reminded that many are here for much more than just a little fun. Thanks :)"

crossdressing,3cnh24,femmedude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"Funny that there's two topics at the same time about this subject :D  As I wrote in the other thread I use a pre-shaped bra, this one to be precise. It's lovely and it gives off a subtle boob-shaped curve. This method of course doesn't work in all cases and the results are modest (80A in my case). If you want double D's you're gonna have to pad in some way :D"
crossdressing,3cnh24,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"Basically you start with a bra and fill it out. You can use a small bra like the other poster, no padding needed. A larger size needs filling, which can be done with sandwich bags with rice, or with real breast forms, or any number of other possibilities. Socks are also common. Measure yourself to get your band size and then pick a common cup size. If your goal is to pass then you might not want to attract extra attention by choosing something unusual.  Try stuff out, it's not hard to get something fairly believable (as long as you don't want to show cleavage, that's a whole other ball of wax)."
crossdressing,3cnh24,oox8ue0G,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"by choosing something unusual.   Aye, another reason I went with the A-cup. It's dainty, but it's there."

I'm sure Amazon would have this as well.  For wigs I've used Amazon, but it's sometimes hit and miss because the way the I imagine how the wig looks is a bit different than how it actually looks. Just a heads up on my experience :)  And finally, for cheap clothes and shoes I head to eBay. I'll enter my query and set a price filter. There are so many listings on eBay that even at pretty low price filters, you get a load of results. Good luck!"

I live in Europe and I'm a fan of H&M and New Look. I also like River Island, especially their jewelry (got most of my earrings from there), but they're a bit more expensive.  I can't suggest much for wigs and cosmetics. I bought my lipstick from a store called Superdrug and nail polish from a local supermarket. This may help though: https://www.reddit.com/r/crossdressing/wiki/dress-up-guide"
crossdressing,3ciqdw,ana07,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"For cheap wigs and skirts to start with, you can get basically anything from AliExpress, quality is variable, as is the sizing, so order one of something (like $2 panties) before you commit to multiple pairs. I have started only buying things that list the size ranges in centimeters haha.   You can grab a cheap pair of girls glasses from Zenni Optical - Actually all of my glasses came from there, occasionally I will have problems but the cost is so low I can write off multiple pairs and still be good to go :)"
crossdressing,3chjje,saralovescd,5,Tue Jul 7 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"It might be helpful if you share your shaving routine.  Things that generally help: Use an electric shaver to get everything short before you shave with a blade. Exfoliate. Take a long, hot bath to open up your pours. Exfoliate.  Shave in the tub, especially WITH the grain with a SHARP razor. Use shaving cream/foam. Exfoliate. Finish in a shower, and finish the shower on cold (this closes your pores and forces out oils/dirt.  Use a high-quality oil-free moisture lotion (Neutrogena is expensive but totally worth it in my opinion).  Source: Trans woman with flawless skin."
crossdressing,3chjje,SharpAtTheEdge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"I use a similar method of electric to trim/safety razor to clear.  I find it helps to have water running over the areas about to be shaved for 5 minutes before applying shaving cream, or at least have the area wet when applying the foam/gel.  Afterwards, a dab of coconut oil (extra virgin, organic, no chemicals) spread over the newly hairless area seems to do the trick for me."

crossdressing,3chjje,SharpAtTheEdge,2,Wed Jul 8 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"I also use it in my hair.  Basically, comb in a few dollups, sleep in a shower cap, rinse out the next day and shampoo/condition as per usual.  Maybe a once per week/once every two week treatment.  Helps the scalp to stay clean and healthy.  Blasts dandruff.  Makes the hair silky and smooth.  I remember reading somewhere that stuff has a bazillion uses."

crossdressing,3cdpxp,josie29,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional here, but I think you could do with a little color on the cheeks. You are looking a little washed out. Also, adding some bronzer to round out your cheek bones. Lining the inside of your eyelids will get rid of the red look, if you can stomach doing it. It took me a while to get used to it.   If anything, there are a ton of videos on YouTube that will give you pointers. Male to female transformations are great, but the makeup advice videos are invaluable. Good luck lady, I know you'll be great!"
crossdressing,3cdpxp,level5miniboss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"Just on first impressions: -Find you a good beard cover in your shade. Its not too severe on you since you have light hair, but there is a ver faint shadow. -That eyeshadow may be a bit too neutral for you. -Lip color wioll make everything else pop. -You need some bronzer and maybe a little rouge to add some depth. Or else look at trying some contouring. -I would recommend a good skin primer for your skin type, but also a good eye primer. Some eye primers come in smokier colors, which makes the smokey look look even better. Also, if new to eyeshadow, learn to tape your eyes to keep it within limits. That helped me. -Consider a gel eyeliner to emphasize the size of your eye and to outline it, while seperating it from your eyeshadow, especially if you use an eyeshadow color that is similar to your eyes. But eyeliner just makes an eye pop too. -Concealer is a handy tool as well. -last tip, look up gossmakeupartist on youtube. Hes a great makeup artist in his own right, and he uses his own face as an example most of the time, so you sort of get an idea on how to apply makeup to a male face. Good Luck!"

Many African American women wear wigs so if you live in any but the smallest town there will be several shops in your area. And they are used to having guys come in to since your local drag queens probably shop there too! Bring three bucks for a wig cap and try some on. The display models are only the style. They usually have different Cora in the back. Expect to spend $35-50 for a decent quality wig.   Alternately go on eBay and search for "" lace front wig"" and browse. Just be sure to search for US only."

crossdressing,3ccgmb,BiToTheBone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:24:12 2015 UTC,I think if you've just started dressing you're better off going to eBay and picking up several different budget wigs to let you try different styles and colours until you find your match.

But heck, I'm no expert.  With regards to your looks. No you're not ugly, as you yourself say. But I have to ask: is the look in your profile picture your daily look, or looks for a party?

crossdressing,3c8on5,shynycd,2,Sun Jul 5 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"Hi all, It's been quite a while since I last posted - a lot of experiences, personal growth, and CD self-acceptance since then. Much of it thanks in part to the amazing people in this subreddit.  Since last December, I've finally been out in public while dressed (Amsterdam and NYC) and had a first manicure, first bar visits, first shopping (Ikea of all places), and first time getting pulled over by police - twice in one night - while dressed. (Not for CDing, but for traffic stuff - they were very respectful and professional, didn't bat an eye, gave me the appropriate warnings and sent me on my way). I hope to write a longer post with details, to perhaps inspire others like I was inspired here too.  In the meantime, I've gained a lot of confidence, more of my wife's support, and feel like I'm on a roll... Next stop is a business trip to San Francisco starting next week. My plans including dressing up and going out as much as possible when I'm not working. Can anyone recommended CD-friendly bars, clubs or restaurants in the SFO Bay Area?  Or better yet, any CD groups, meetings or events that are open to visitors? This one's important since I admit it's been thrilling to be finally out, but actually a bit lonely. Or if someone just wants to hit the town together, that be we fantastic too!  I'm hoping to reach what I think is the next milestone, meeting other crossdressers like me.  Also...any recommendations for a local Sephora or MAC location that's good with CD makeovers and instruction? I'm willing to try on my own, but would rather go to someone recommended.  The two pics are from my outing in Amsterdam. Sorry for the quality - it was late at night and didn't want to use the flash."
crossdressing,3c8on5,Hollied,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"Back in March, I was able to spend a weekend in San Francisco, dressed the entire time.  I got my nails done at Quince Spa in the Potrero area........the ladies there did an excellent job & didn't bat an eye.  I found a great deal there on Groupon.  For makeup, I had mine done at the flagship BareMinerals boutique in the Westfield Mall downtown.  Needless to say, I was very happy with the results.  I found the whole city easy to get around in while dressed, but for bars, clubs, and restaurants, the Castro and/or Haight-Ashbury would be good.  There are at least a few here in the community that hail from the Bay Area.  Liz (MyWeekendShoes) and Marie (MaybeMarie) come to mind.  Perhaps you could drop one of them a line.  I hope you enjoy your time in San Francisco.  If you ever find your way to the Phoenix area, feel free to hit me up."

I think the whole existence of the feminism movement and projects like Everyday Sexism surely show that is the case.

crossdressing,3c74u3,casualcrossdresser,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"While sexual orientation is a separate thing from a motive to crossdress. I hypothesis that there is some crossover with some crossdressing guys that has less to do with actually being attracted to other guys and more about a desire to know what it's like to be a female having sex with a guy. A desire to be desired the way men desire women. I could be wrong. I'm not the kind of crossdresser that takes on a female persona. So I'm still trying to understand the motivation behind that. I'm thinking that for some people that might be a component. But even if it is, I'm guessing it's more about fantasy than actually doing it, unless you really are bi/gay."

crossdressing,3c77co,Hollied,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"Well let's not forget, men used to wear high heels and I'm pretty sure paint their nails too. Jewelry was similarly worn by both sexes universally. Kilts are still worn by men in Scotland, and the Romans wore skirts.  Obviously it's the same for women too. Many men see suits, ties, tattoos, and even shirts as unflattering on women. Not to mention all the menswear you get in other 'unisex' types of clothing, like men's jackets, trousers, jumpers, cardigans, and so on that provoke a similar reaction.  So you are right, it is just social norms that (Western) women wear jewelry, cosmetics, heels, skirts, dresses, blouses, etc. and men wear suits and ties, and that's what influences people's opinions. If someone tries to contradict that, point out the history if possible. Men don't look good in high heels? Not what people used to think: http://qz.com/409254/why-did-men-stop-wearing-high-heels-anyway/.   Anyway, although you might have a hard time convincing your girlfriend or anyone else, especially if there's no point to be made from history, by far the most important thing is that you convince yourself."
crossdressing,3c77co,ana07,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:25 2015 UTC,"To expand on the whole high heels were originally a men's shoe, they were actually military shoes. They were designed to hook into the sturips on a saddle. You can even see this reflected in modern cowboy boots which have a slightly raised heel. But still either way gender is just a social construct, it's all in our heads (collectively)."
crossdressing,3c77co,L1lly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"I'm already convinced. My goal now is to convince the world so that others coming into this won't have to struggle so much with acceptance.  Plus to be honest I would like more acceptance for myself from others. Who doesn't... really? Even if I'm confident about how I present myself to the world, I would like to get men to the level women are at, where we can go out in a dress or jeans and most people think nothing of it."
crossdressing,3c77co,pohlished-swag,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"It is my opinion that at least half of all males out there would love to have painted nails at least half of the time. I know 'am a sucker for nail polish! and other ""female"" ""only"" items and attire. And I still struggle to quiet my inner voices of guilt and shame. Every now and then. Yes, deprograming my mind is not an easy task. Just imagine the rest of the people who are so very mind controlled? But, then again I question the hell out of everything that I am told. I also entertain my self with dissecting my own beliefs, ideas, thoughts, views, theories, so as a result there is nothing set in stone for me I feel so sorry for those humans who think their and other humans' ideals, views, etc, etc, are set in stone. High intelligence; More importantly wisdom, comes at a high price. It gets very lonely at the top. And conversely I am immensely satisfied and fulfilled and very happy with who I am. True happiness that only comes from within. So my friend, I advise you to do the same. Remember the pursuit of happiness is: HEART AND SOUL, OVER, mind(brain) and matter! Much love."

I took everything with me despite the weight of my case, I was all geared up, I had shaved my chest, was all ready to show my new boobs off....and I choked.  I have gone out before, this wasn't the first time, which is why I felt so seemingly okay with it. I was putting all my make up on but I just couldn't get it right at all. I hadn't got the eye shadow I wanted with me which i think set me off slightly, then I just was getting mad/worried it wasn't working right.  The time i dressed up before just casually, went down incredibly well so i was really looking forward to actually going out this time and showing that effort off, but when i get nervous i sweat, and it was already really hot here in the UK last week so i felt gross despite just showering and I eventually passed on dressing up. My friend insisted that I try again and she said she'd help but i was just bit mad (and secretly) upset and I didn't want to waste her time so we could go out.  Has this happened to anyone else? Did I do the right thing? Was it just performance anxiety? Any help would be appreciated as I have a pride festival next month and I don't want to miss that one the same way."

Going outside dressed is a huge hassle for us and it does suck when you just can't get your makeup right.  You just feel like someone is going to out you and give you a hard time in front of the whole world because you chose the wrong shade of lipstick.  I'm pretty sure GGs go through something similar.  You need to take up your friend's offer and let her help you get ready.  It'll be a lot more fun and she can make sure you get your makeup just right.  Just take a deep breath, remind yourself it's all going to be okay.  I have to do this before I go hang out with my friends.  No matter how I feel, at least I can get the satisfaction that they're going to be there for you.  You're lucky that you have someone so accepting of you who will help you out.  I can't wait to find a friend like that."
crossdressing,3c77vu,Lyn724,2,Tue Jul 7 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"Now that I've come out to everyone that I want to come out to(at this moment), I'm kind of lost now. Of course I want to express myself the way I really want to, and continue with exploring my non binary identity, but I think it would be weird for me to just immediately begin painting my nails in public, or dressing more feminine. Eventually I want to do this, but I feel like it might take time to do so. I'm still unsure about a lot of things really."
crossdressing,3c77vu,Hollied,3,Sun Jul 5 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"There's no real hurry unless you feel there is.  Just be yourself, whichever gender that may be at any given time.  Things don't have to be immediate, just do whatever feels comfortable.  We'll be there for you no matter what.  hugs"
crossdressing,3c77vu,Lyn724,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:49:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. I appreciate it. All this support I've gotten in the last few months has been extremely helpful.
crossdressing,3c77vu,casualcrossdresser,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give the opposite advice. Death could be upon us at any time. So don't waste a minute not being who you are.  When you think about it, we live such short lives in the span of the universe. Why artificially limit ourselves for any longer than we absolutely have to? It's stupid that society concerns itself so much with things like this (men in women's clothing) when there are far more important tasks at hand. Really it should be no bother at all that there is a guy in a dress and lipstick over there. It's so stupid when you really think about. Do what makes you happy if it doesn't harm anyone else."
crossdressing,3c77vu,ana07,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, maybe not just start walking around fully dressed in public during the day, but try and find some events to go to which you can dress up for. Like a simple night out in a club/bar or any other event where people are going to be more accepting (in the case of going to a club or bar, so drunk and having too much fun to care).  Or, if you don't want the exposure of being in public, maybe just be around the people who you've come out to more often (dressed of course!). Especially if they're women, talk to them about your outfits and fashion and other stuff which interests them, and helps you explore your identity too."

crossdressing,3c77vu,Lady_Fiona,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:59:31 2015 UTC,+1 for the rice idea.  I am trying to figure out what size of boobs I want to buy right now.  I've been using balloons filled with rice.  It gets the job done.  Start out with 3/4th cup and go up.  Get some pretty large balloons so you can shape them.  The smaller ones want to stay in ball shapes instead of staying the way you mold them.
crossdressing,3c77vu,oox8ue0G,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"I used what I think are called ""sandwich bags"" in english. They don't have much shape of themselves, so when filling them with rice you could sort of squish them into the right shape. And you can weigh them to make sure they're equal size.  In my experiments it seems you need a lot less than you think for believable breasts. You do need a bra to fill to make it work."

If said person comes to the conclusion that they are trans, they can begin hormone replacement therapy which, provided that they are trans, can result in a huge improvement in quality of life. The earlier this is done the less they suffer needless pain and the more effective the hormones will be at effecting the body. Also, in regards to you thinking it wouldn't be an option for you, if you think it would be right for you if it weren't for such a masculine body, you may want to check out /r/transtimelines especially best of all time.

And by ""half my life"" I mean once every 4-5 months for an hour or so.  In the past year, I've bought my own clothes and shoes and I crossdress whenever I have the chance too. Which is still maybe 1-2 a month.  I live at home and I long for the opportunity to have a place of my own to where I can dress to my hearts desire.  But this is where my fear comes in. What will I discover about myself when I have all that time to dress? When I can just come home from work, strip out of my boring man clothes and into something sexy or slutty? When I can take more pictures and practice my makeup and enjoy my toys?  I've never really considered myself to be trans, as I do enjoy my male self and identity, but would that change when I have the freedom to fully express the female side of me?  It's scary."

So i transitioned, pretty much because i didnt really have a choice anymore. i had to become who i knew i was"
crossdressing,3c3nez,thehalfwit,2,Sun Jul 5 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of feeling that as well. But you mentioned that you tried to convince yourself that you were a ""straight crossdresser"".

I too am into forced fem, even make a decent living writing forced fem and crossdressing erotica.   i've known some trans people who have changed orientation   Thats one of the fears I have.

When I started counseling more than 10 years ago, in the first session I mentioned I had this private me and public me, and I needed to reconcile them. Over the years, I asked a lot of questions. And in time it became clear I'm not transgender; I just like to dress.  To a certain extent, I've found an outlet. I do standup, and last October I introduced a female character that's over the top. And people love her, even more than my regular shit, and I find that conflicting. But it feels so good."

I thought about it a lot, and I realized my experiences don't equal yours, even given the similarities.  For me, I relish the fact that I can go out and do standup dressed in the hottest open mic in Northern Nevada. The greatest thing is people are cool about it."
crossdressing,3c3nez,NaughtyAlena,2,Sun Jul 5 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"I started off cross dressing in secret. Then dated a girl who was (kind of) into it a little bit. Then cross dressed more and more after her and I broke up. It's taken me many years to realize I was trans and that transitioning is right for me. I don't know if it's right for you, only you can know that. But be open with your therapist. The first few sessions will likely be hard as hell to open up about. But it'll get easier.   If you ever have questions or concerns there are a ton of us over at /r/asktransgender who were only crossdressers for many years.   EDIT: After 5 months HRT I can't say that it's better. But I can say I couldn't go back to who I was before, for whatever that's worth. Yesterday I went out in girl mode and it felt amazing to be out in a dress on a beautiful day. And that's a feeling I have never had as a guy, and it felt like me. Which may seem confusing since I said I couldn't say that it's better 5 months in, but those moments like I had yesterday are worth it. And worth pushing on and figuring out ""how to girl"""

I had a look at your pictures and personal find you very attractive (irrespective of gender --read label) If you continue down the counseling route then may I suggest that it is only a way to find your self. A good concealer / physiologist will never tell you to do this or that but rather help you find what you are looking for.. and I wish you all the luck in the world in doing that.

Not something I would do personally but shouldn't be anything creepy or weird about that   Or twisted, like the psychotic killer in The Silence of the Lambs.

crossdressing,3c53u3,nylonbritches,10,Sat Jul 4 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"a normal human being?  seriously, you're just a guy who is comfortable wearing whatever the hell you want. If it's what you like, have at it hoss. You are you and you don't need to fit in so much as you just need to accept who you are. It's as plain and simple as that."
crossdressing,3c53u3,CanadianCasualCD,9,Sat Jul 4 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"More of an underdressing crossdresser (people who wear panties/bra/tights under their normal clothes out in public). As far as the nightwear, simply a crossdresser. It's nothing too far out of the ordinary. It's really cool that you and your girlfriend share like that, though in my perfect world we'd just do away with the boxers altogether ;P   I'm not gay, but   Can we do away with this, though? x.x It's a huge misconception that crossdressing has anything to do with one's sexuality. Idk the last time we had a poll but the overwhelming majority of crossdressers are straight or bicurious. I mean, I like the femininity, and I want to find someone who enjoys being feminine as much (or more) than I do, so men isn't a great place for me to start looking. And that's probably a common and blaringly-obvious theme that so many people overlook when they think about crossdressers.  I hope it doens't look like I'm calling you out on anything, you just provided a great springboard for me to bring up that topic."
crossdressing,3c53u3,_stiletto,5,Sat Jul 4 22:56:34 2015 UTC,I am a guy and I love wearing women's underwear would have been the appropriate way for me to start this off. Please forgive me !
crossdressing,3c53u3,DunmerPrincess,6,Sat Jul 4 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not gay, but love wearing women's underwear and other items of ladies clothing.   I'll tell you one thing this doesn't make you: like the vast majority of gay men. The notion that crossdressing is primarily a gay thing is an inaccurate stereotype that came about because of the combination of drag queens' relative prominence in the public eye, and the offensive idea that any man who is attracted to other men must not be much of a man at all.  I would hope it goes without saying here that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay, but I would like this pervasive stereotype to be eliminated, because it's pretty obvious from spending time on this sub that the majority of crossdressers are straight."
crossdressing,3c53u3,Lyn724,5,Sat Jul 4 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"I apologize in my wording. There is nothing wrong with being gay and I guess the point I was really trying to make was more like I wear the women's clothing, yet don't go all out like in wearing the breast forms and wig. I really don't know what draws me to this, but I'm glad I'm not alone ! I really wish all clothing were considered unisex clothing."

crossdressing,3c4jo2,casualcrossdresser,9,Sat Jul 4 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! :)  First of all, I support you a full 100% to dress the way you want, to be called/addressed the way you want.. and to behave in a way that feels good and true to you.  Secondly, it's okay if you don't understand why there are CD's who do what I do (I can only speak for myself), i.e. dress up with breast forms for all the feminine curves, put extra effort in the make-up to shape a male face to something somewhat more feminine, who watch their step while walking in heels. I still don't understand exactly why I want to do it.. just that I want to and that it's important to me. My friends don't understand either, but they accept and support me.. and they're cool with it. :)  And perhaps, for some.. it's pretending or acting or role-playing to be a women. For me, it's another part of me.. and this is how I express myself. And for me, 'just' putting on a dress is not enough.. I might as well not dress up.  So, my attitude for everyone,.. male/female/whatever.. wear what you like in whatever way you like! And feel awesome, true to yourself and free from whatever restrictions society has put upon us.   But please, I'm not 'pretending' to be anything else than me.   And one particular day, that might be me in a t-shirt with my university logo, beard and sneakers.. and on another day.. it might be me in a gorgeous dress, 5 inch heels, fantastic make-up.. and you can call me ""Tassia, dear"". :)"
crossdressing,3c4jo2,natcrys,2,Sat Jul 4 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. More power to you. I guess for me I just have an interest in human nature and I like to try to understand what motivates people to do what they do. For myself, I'm more like a dimmer than a light switch. I have what some might call a feminine side but it's less like a side and more like half of a spectrum that is continuous and fluid and that's a separate thing from the way I dress. The clothing is just clothing, it doesn't represent anything to me that would cause me to act differently when wearing it or adopt a female name. In other words it's not a prop or a costume required to get me in character. Which is how I feel like a lot of crossdressers use female clothing.  Which is why I use the word pretend. Because even if they have that side of their personality inside them, why do they need to dress that way to bring it out? Why do they need to adopt a new name or pronouns? It's like they need a new name because they feel like they are two different people rather than being one person with just a wide range to their personality.  I guess if I do have a problem with it (which generally I don't as I support people doing anything they want that is nonharmful) it's that by doing it that way, we continue to draw a line between male and female using fashion. Whereas I would rather see us blur the lines to the point where a dress or nailpolish or a one piece bathing suit is no longer considered female attire, it's just another article of clothing a person (of any sex) might wear because they like it. I want to get rid of this idea that clothing defines or highlights your sex, whereas a lot of traditional crossdressers use female clothing not to try and blur that line but to further highlight it. Acting more like a light switch where they flip from male to female mode and the clothing becomes a prop to express which mode they are in.  I guess I see myself differently. I am one person. I am one physical sex. My personality has a huge range but I'm always me. I don't need to divide myself up into a male version and a female version. I am a spectrum unto myself. My clothing is an expression of my personality to an extent. But the fact that I'm wearing a dress or a pair of pants has nothing to do with whether I'm feeling more masculine or feminine, just like it doesn't for a woman who puts on either a pair of pants or a dress that day. The expression of my personality is more in the style, color, pattern or slinkiness of that garment. Like if I'm feeling self conscious I might wear something more baggy versus tighter fitting. If I'm feeling cheery I might wear brighter colors.   I'm just trying to fight the good fight to get men more fashion freedom. But sometimes I feel like traditional crossdressers hurt that cause (for the time being) by helping to further associate clothing items with gender/sex and by taking on a female persona (even if it is part of them) when dressed in female clothing. Because I think it's harder for other people to understand that. That's where most everyday people get weirded out and start looking at us all like we're creeps or perverts or something. They don't get the whole putting on a dress and calling yourself Lisa thing. It seems fake and crazy to them, like you're schizophrenic or something. Like you're trying to be something you are not, a woman. Especially if we aren't passable. But when you instead say ""I'm just a man who wants to wear dresses and makeup and stuff because I want choices."" That's still hard enough to swallow for them because of their peconceived notions about gender, but with some convincing they get where the inequality exists in that lack of choice for men.   So while I personally have nothing wrong with it. I am trying to better understand the motivation to do it and I do think it kind of hurts the progress of acceptance in society when it comes to fashion freedom. As much as I hate saying that because I want you to be you."
crossdressing,3c4jo2,natcrys,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thanks for the long and thought-out reply. :)  Not going into everything, because frankly, I think we are in different situations with different goals (even though there might be a practical overlap). I just think a reply like yours deserves a reply back.   My brain is wired differently than yours,.. and while I wouldn't mind knowing more about the how and the why.. ultimately, for me, it's irrelevant to my day-to-day activities.  I think you should look to society. Because it is society that needs changing and it is society that needs to accept that people want to dress and present themselves as they want. And I don't think you should be having a problem with the fact that lots of crossdressers do like to draw sharp lines between a feminine and a masculine image.  For me, clothes matter.. wearing high heels matters.. they all bring out that part of me that is considered feminine. I still call it my side, I don't act or pretend. My brother likes wearing suits.. he feels more powerful when he walks into the boardroom dressed like that as compared to jeans and t-shirts. He's still the same guy.  Why do people need to dress in a certain way to make them feel and behave in a certain way? Don't know.. but that's how it works with a lot of people, not just crossdressers. Girls will say that they feel more feminine in a cute polka-dot dress. Give a guy a good fitting Italian suit.. and he will feel like the freaking man!  Anyway, wrapping up.. it's great that you're fighting the good fight for guys to have more fashion freedom. And if hyper-femininely-dressed crossdressers think that you're hurting their cause because you supposedly 'don't make an effort to present a feminine image'.. I'll be standing right next to you.  So.. fight the fight with the society.. not with crossdressers who also just want to dress the way want to."

crossdressing,3c4jo2,Boob-Philosopher,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"I guess it's like a spectrum thing, at one end of the scale you have guys who occasionally like to wear girls clothing or makeup but still identify as guys (""my name is Bert"") and would only sleep with cis woman, somewhere in the middle I guess you would have a guy who occasionally likes to wear girls clothing and but also allow the feminine personality to take over (""my name is Wanda"") and would sleep with either sex, then finally at the opposite end you may have a guy who identifies solely as a woman and through a combination of HRT and surgery becomes a full transgender female.  It was quite a revelation to me when I realised alot of cross dressers still identify as men while wearing a skirt and high heels and are not the slightest bit interested in cock.  Going back to where you're at right now, in reality you are free to wear woman's clothing however because you've prophesized that people will be ""making comments or looking at you funny"" you're really only left with three choices 1) Conform and dress like society wants you to dress, 2)Don't conform and dress how you want therefore being the change you wish to see in the world and ignore any funny looks etc or 3)Patiently wait for society/fashion to catch up/get to the point where a man can wear a dress without people ""making comments or looking at you funny"".  It has to be noted that woman have the best of both worlds, they can wear guys clothing or girls clothing. Sometimes in the past when a new Girlfriend stays over they always seem to want to wear one of my shirts to relax in, can you imagine if as a guy when you stay over at a new Girlfriends you asked to wear one of her dresses to lounge about in! :)  The male Stereotype is strong, Gentleman or Geezer, if you want to wear woman's clothing you will be breaking a common stereotype and therefore will stand out (unless your passable)."

Generally most of the make up they do, plus a bit of extra foundation and cover up, will go a long way. Else if you know how to shave your face, you can pretty much do the rest of your body.

I think I did message you before but yeah haah :P
crossdressing,3bw8qf,alicia2468,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:04:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! How did you do it?
crossdressing,3bw8qf,alicia2468,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:21:40 2015 UTC,I tried to do face to face but it's tough with most of my friends at different universities.  But yeah I'd suggest that versus online since it's easier to avoid the topic there.
crossdressing,3bw8qf,thatladyjinwaiting,2,Fri Jul 3 00:29:33 2015 UTC,I've initially came out to friends who I believe will be receptive/supportive of my choice based on previous conversations with them and how they've reacted to LGBTQ news and similar situations.  So far I have about 90+% support.   I don't know if you're in a situation with friends/family who give off a vibe of being okay with your choice so its hard to tell you to try it the way I have.  I may be lucky or just lucky I have great people in my life.  Good luck to you when you tell the lucky few!
crossdressing,3bw8qf,rofrangiselle,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"Told my ex when we first started dating almost a decade ago. Was fine, but then she used it against me after we broke up.  fast forward to now, and my current gf and i are super happy together. She encourages my dressing up and i am super happy for it.  i've come out to many of my friends, other friends im hesitant to tell. It's funny when you tell someone and find out that they're super happy for me. But it really just depends on the other person. My general rule is, if you can come out to a friend about your dressing up, and they dont accept you, they were never really your friend. I have found though that the more people I come out to, the happier I am. Some of my family members know, like my mother and my sister (i don't live with my father), several of my cousins know as well and most of my close friends and coworkers know. The majority of people I've told has accepted me and understands my situation. My advice to you is feel people out, listen to their ideas on LGBT issues and when you're ready, tell people. Most people I feel are understanding, and if they're not, they just need to be educated and exposed to issues like this. Good luck with everything! I wish you well on your journey =D"
crossdressing,3bw8qf,_stiletto,2,Thu Jul 2 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"There are several posts about people coming out to friends with good results, and I've been talking to others on the subreddit who have also been pleasantly surprised. Mid 2015 is a really, really bad time for people to be closed-off to LGBTQ issues/people, especially in the wake of the SCOTUS ruling and Caitlyn Jenner. But to a nervous crossdresser, that only goes so far...  Here's what I will say: Pick a friend who you think will probably be okay with it. There are no guarantees in life, but if you're anything like me, you gave off enough vibes (as much as I played it off) that people haven't pigeonholed you into Macho-Macho Man role. So given that...  The first person you tell is going to be nerve wracking. It just is. This is a secret you've probably sat on for years. That's not an easy thing to start talking about.  The second person is going to be nerve wracking too, but slightly less so.  The third person will also make you pretty nervous.  The 4+5 might come together because you'll be telling a couple (Or you won't but whatever, roll with me).  6+7 will be the ones you were wary about from the start, but you already had 5 before them so it might go well; it does.  8 will be pretty nerve wracking, too.  Then after you tell 9, you'll look back and realize 4-9 actually weren't all that bad.  Then, again if you're like me, the frustration starts building up that you have to be closed off with everyone else in your life when after telling 9 people you've concluded that no, you're actually not a freak, and this isn't as freaky as you think Hollywood has made it out to be (I've been there. Fuck you Hollywood).   Anyway if you truly feel that your friends wouldn't be accepting then I'll suggest pick the person you think would be the most accepting and work down the list from there. Or make more friends (Because that's sooooo easy... not).   As for makeup, uhh... *ducks* not my realm of expertise. /r/makeupaddiction and YouTube are helpful for that."
crossdressing,3bw8qf,_stiletto,2,Fri Jul 3 08:47:27 2015 UTC,"I actually read your posts when you first posted them, and its one of the reasons I've been thinking about it lately! I like your idea of exposing yourself to a group of facebook friends, and then a larger one. I just have some questions about it if its okay!  Were most of the friends that you told male or female, and which order? How did you go about telling them? And lastly, does your family know?"

crossdressing,3btme0,_stiletto,2,Thu Jul 2 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"Most people don't notice a lack of something subtle, like body hair. Unless you're a woolly mammoth and it's kind of something you're known for (like it or not). Then people might notice when you come in silky smooth one day.  Also if you let the stubble grow out they might.  Look all I'm saying is that I started shaving in 10th grade in what I'd consider a very gossipy (but small) school, and only one person EVER noticed (while he was picking at his own leg hair then happened to look down at me), asked if I shaved (yes) and why (""I don't like body hair"" (not a lie; not the full truth)), then dropped it and moved on with his day."

crossdressing,3bu2z0,Paula_56,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a sheath dress... Long sleeve and high neckline, too. I will say that this dress doesn't work for everyone, and that ""Sheath"" look is acquired by hugging curves most crossdressers don't naturally have. That means either great genetics or proper padding.  I love the look of this dress and many like it, but couldn't ever pull it off, and that's a reality I've had to come to terms with. I mostly stick to knee-length A-line or belted dresses, nowadays. Anything that pinches near the waist to create curve and then flares/falls outwards naturally to add dimension/hips.  If none of this applies to you, so be it, but I'd file it under ""General advice"" for crossdressers discovering how to pick female clothes for a male body. I'm assuming the picture isn't you because you were specifically asking about the dress. If that is you, or if you look like that in that dress, then god damnit please rock the hell out of that dress in my stead."

crossdressing,3bsvos,pohlished-swag,2,Wed Jul 1 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"Thus far I have only worn either leggings or yoga pants or yoga capris. I pair them with a male shirt that covers the (bulge) for decency sakes. And even though the (bulge) is very minimal, I just don't like to make anybody else uncomfortable! The only underwear that I wear is; Regular underwear i/e, boy shorts, hipsters, etc, etc, since the leggings or yoga pants already have some control built into them. However; on some occasions when a flat front is needed, well, then! you know the more control the underwear has, the better! I hope this helps."

crossdressing,3brlyf,sissylexie93,3,Wed Jul 1 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sizing is weird. People come in lots of shapes and sizes. Manufacturers take average women's measurements and squeeze them into a scale. And then do the same for average men's measurements. Guess what? There's no real relation, sorry. Depending on various ratios you'll go up or down sizes depending on the item.  Just grab a measuring tape and measure yourself. There are plenty of guides online.  The general issue you'll have for dresses is that while the waist and bust measurements might work, you waist will likely be too small. That's ok, them's the breaks. For other clothing, just uses the measurements and compare with online charts.  Good luck!"
crossdressing,3brlyf,oox8ue0G,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:39:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I'll try my best and might post results after my shopping spree in a couple days! If anyone has any suggestions for things they like id be so excited to look and add them to my list!   _^
crossdressing,3brlyf,sissy_monique,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"It's a little trial and error, but if it helps I am 6 feet tall with a 30 inch waist and weigh about 170 pounds. I would characterize my body type as slender. I would wear a suit off the rack 40L jacket with 30x34 trousers and a 16/33 long sleeve shirt. The corresponding Women's sizes for me are Large knits and blouses, size 12 dresses, size 8 jeans and shorts. 8 Long women's trousers. It it's also dependent on US versus European sizing and dependent on the whim of the manufacturer. Go and try some stuff on. The retailer where you're shopping, for the vast majority of the time won't care, they just want to sell you stuff. Congratulations and good luck."
crossdressing,3bpthm,DunmerPrincess,3,Wed Jul 1 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"Congrats :)   although I'm pretty sure my mom is convinced it means I'm gay (she kept bringing it up), which is annoying and based on a really frustrating old stereotype   Well, did you specifically -say- that you're not gay? I mean, apparently you said ""Happy pride, from my alterego""... Which refers to gay pride, which implies that you're coming out as gay :)   Just have a chat with your family. They'll be fine and so will you."
crossdressing,3bpthm,littlemissfuzzy,3,Wed Jul 1 13:16:04 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't say explicitly I'm not gay, I did make clear that I'm not trans and that I'm as excited as ever for my upcoming wedding to my girlfriend. I don't think there was confusion on that angle from anyone but my mom, I think that was due to her personal experience knowing a few drag performer types when she was younger."

I don't take pictures of myself very often so posting a selfie would've felt weird, but this was almost a perfect ""accident."" I got to have someone who supported me show me off and the response has been great. Or at least the haters are keeping their mouths shut. Either way the weight of trying to keep it somewhat hidden has lifted and I feel A LOT more comfortable with myself. Happy Pride to you and all the other girls out there!"

The extent of my Facebook outing will likely be a separate profile for my alterego, along with the blog I'm about to launch.  Other than that, I have to be careful as outing myself to everyone may cost me one of my jobs (I coach high school sports at a charter school).  So happy for you & hope everything goes well with your parents."
crossdressing,3bpthm,LeelaBaileyGW,2,Wed Jul 1 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I thought about doing the same but I've heard both good and bad things could happen if you go out and do a big statement on such a wide platform like FB. I'm still somewhat ""in the closet"" and portray myself as a normal straight guy, but I consider myself bi and bi-gender/fluid to some extent.. And I get the feeling that most of the people on my FB would take it as that I was gay. Which I'm not. I've only told a couple friends that I was bi but I haven't mentioned anything about being a CD to anyone I know. Anyway, congrats! I hope I can figure out one day how to feel free to be who I really am without the feeling of guilt or fear. You rock!"
crossdressing,3bpthm,kira_paige,2,Wed Jul 1 20:41:07 2015 UTC,Keep tearing down the walls.  Everyone that comes out and sharing their story to the world pushes new people to be aware of Trans and gender non conforming issues.  I am super proud of you!!   hugs
crossdressing,3bpthm,_stiletto,2,Wed Jul 1 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"This honestly sounds so much like my experience two months ago. I'm four years out of high school and I was getting responses from people I haven't seen since ELEMENTARY. Mine was a little more planned than shotgunned, but now is a fantastic time to be coming out of the closet for crossdressers. I know we ""barely"" fall undre the LGBTQ umbrella. LGB sexualities have absolutely nothing to do with the majority of us who are straight, and most of us aren't really T, and Q is largely undefined. We fall under it via gender-nonconformity, but baaaaarely.  Anyway, with the Caitlyn Jenner story and now the whole LGBTQ community having parades all over the place, the iron could not be hotter right now to come out. My responses, too, were overwhelmingly positive.  Good luck with your family. My dad's side was disowned a decade ago. My mom is supportive. My grandparents are kind of forced (by my mom) to be okay with it. My cousin has always known. One uncle is totally for it (guess who the black sheep in the family is?), the other uncle avoids the topic.   Good luck to you! Congratulations! <3"
crossdressing,3br496,susanking1956,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the amount of jewelry is fine. I like the layering of the Cami under the dress to alleviate cleavage concerns; I do that all the time as well. I do think a knee-length dress might behoove you, but I like the colors on that dress as well.  Also if you start coming out to one person at a time, eventually you'll hit critical mass where NOT being able to be open about it is more frustrating than anything else. If coming out is really something you want to do, try telling 1 new person (who you honestly think will react positively) every 3-4 months. You'll work up MORE than enough frustration (or courage) by the end of 2016."

crossdressing,3bqu8s,Zeema101,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the group and best of luck to you!   whats the best way to find you're size's ranging from shoes to dresses to skirts and everything basically?   Empirical evidence. Trial and error.  You can start by taking basic measurements using a measuring tape and then use some tables from clothing websites. But from there on, you'll really just have to try. Also, don't forget that many clothes have different fits, so one size EU38 might fit entirely different from another EU38 ;)   how do you go about trying on clothing at stores? do you call ahead and ask if its okay?   I haven't done this yet. But no I wouldn't call ahead. I'd go in and get a feel for the atmosphere of the shop. Take a few looks around and if you're approached, you could tell what you're looking for. Also ask for the fitting rooms :)   do you drive to far away towns/cities to buy clothing?   I for one don't. I shop locally or online.   for those who are gay, do your partners usually mind you crossdress?   I'm straight and my wife's fine with it. Couldn't say anything about the gay-angle. Sorry :)"
crossdressing,3bqu8s,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"Hey there, welcome to this awesome subreddit! :)   whats the best way to find you're size's ranging from shoes to dresses to skirts and everything basically?   seriously, just google it. There's plenty of size converters from women's sizes to your shoes/waist/chest in inches/cm.    how do you go about trying on clothing at stores? do you call ahead and ask if its okay?   I actually don't bother doing this, and just take my chances with the sizes I know I am, but yeah I would guess so. Mostly in England you need to show the shop assistant the clothes you're trying on, so it'd raise a few eyebrows, ahaha. I got away with trying on some women's jeans once, though.   do you drive to far away towns/cities to buy clothing?   I live in London for 75% of the year and in a large town for the other 25%, so it's never a problem for me! But if i lived in a village i guess I would, unless I was able to shop online and get stuff delivered   is there anyway you can pay someone to personally help you in definieing your look showing you how to put makeup on, dress properly, walk, talk and basically a person to feminize?   Well you can always ask around here! But I know a few UK fashion chains which have proper fashion advice services, and most retail assistants are meant to know quite a bit anyway. YouTube tutorials are also very helpful. But honestly I'm not sure I'd pay anyone, I'd just ask around here or on other places online and see what people say :)   for those who are gay, do your partners usually mind you crossdress?   heterosexual here so I can't help with that, sorry :)   how do i sound more girly?   If you mean with speech, then I've no idea how to go about that. If you mean with writing, there's a ton of things which are generally seen as more feminine in terms of written language. Trust me, I spent two years studying it for my A-levels (advanced school qualifications), haha."
crossdressing,3bqu8s,ana07,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"G'day :)  1) For sizing, I second the ""empirical evidence"" suggestion. Bust out the old measuring tape! However, make sure you good how to measure women's body measurements. There are a few ways that there measurements are taken differently :)  2) I haven't personally tried this, but as someone who used to work in retail, I'd say it's not a problem for most larger retail chains (Kmarts, Targets, ect)   3) Personally, I do. But I live in a country town, so that's more for access to the better shops then privacy. I have bought a few items from the local township before.   4) I have heard of a few places in Melbourne or Sydney that offer this kind of service, but nothing outside those cities really.    5) I'm hetero, but I have heard there's not really any difference in terms of acceptance between hetero and homo relationships. My experience is limited, so I could be wrong!  6) Practice, Practice, Practice. It's not something I've tried, but I've heard the Eva apps for iphone are really helpful  I wish you all the best in the crazy journey!"
crossdressing,3bqu8s,Lucybat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:45:41 2015 UTC,Something else: look around second hand stores. That way you can try out lots of stuff without spending too much money. Then you're also not stuck with whatever is in fashion right now.

crossdressing,3bng7f,sandyd2001,2,Tue Jun 30 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"Latexcatfish quality is pretty solid, I think - the zippers are a tad cheap, and I'll occasionally have to re-glue a loose seam after some wear, but that's super easy (just a bit of rubber cement and it's good as new). The latex itself feels good and isn't too thin or thick (you can have it thicker if you want for a bit extra).  This is the second piece I've gotten from them (the first being their Hatsune Miku cosplay costume, which is by far one of my favorite outfits to wear) and I'm satisfied enough to keep them on my list of go-to latex stores.  This dress wasn't custom sized - just the generic Male Large - but they do offer made-to-measure for a 20% price hike."
crossdressing,3bng7f,mikuasakura,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:39:12 2015 UTC,Haha! I was totally drooling over that Hatsune Miku costume!  Did you buy it in Male?  I'm wondering how that would look.
crossdressing,3bng7f,Bobsli,2,Wed Jul 1 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bought the generic Male XL, and it fits pretty well considering it's not custom-fit. The stockings that come with it are awesome, they stay up without needing a garter or anything.  I got it with the top + skirt attached and the gloves separate from the sleeves and I'm quite happy with it, though I kinda wish I'd gotten the gloves attached (they fit and all, but it'd just look better if they were seamless with the sleeves).  I've gotten a variety of dresses, minidresses, pieces and parts, and the miku outfit is by far my favorite in terms of both look and feel."

crossdressing,3boefh,ijustlovecutethings,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for introducing yourself and sharing your story. I'm sorry to hear about what happened with your ex. That is a really frustrating sounding situation -- I can't believe she would be enthusiastic and helpful about your crossdressing as friends, but then intolerant of it after getting into a relationship with you -- that she initiated! =/ Anyway, that's great that you have returned to feeling more comfortable about expressing yourself in this way. This community is amazingly helpful and supportive and I'm glad you're here and look forward to seeing you around :)"
crossdressing,3boefh,DunmerPrincess,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the encouragement. And yes, it was a bit surprising, but I guess it just became a different story just treating me like a girl friend who happened to be a guy to a boyfriend. There's lots of reasons it could have been and things that could have happened differently, but that's over and now I'm just looking forward to dressing up. I've talked to people about my urges before, but I've never just told someone flat out how it really makes me so happy to do it. I'm looking forward to being out and about while being dressed up."
crossdressing,3boefh,Jessica_Red,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:49:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing and might I say I am so happy for you to be able to move on to bigger and better things(and be yourself in the process).  I understand how hard it can be having your personality restricted by family or friends or whatever the case may be.   I wish the best for you and hope to see updates soon! 😘
crossdressing,3boefh,Ryunohato,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"I will not welcome you like the peoples above since its my first time here, but first : hello. As someone who doesn't crossdress after reading your whole story there i wanted to ask you (no one force you to repply) ... Is the fact that you like cding linked to your sexuality ? I mean as someone who like being f instead of m and want sometime to be with the opposite, so with a man ?  Since you said  you were bisexual i was thinking maybe you were more suited to be with a man instead of with a woman ?  I'm probably wrong, i'm not a crossdresser myself but i find this subject interesting as a guy (probably) bisexual myself. Im not the subject he, just sayin don't take me bad im just curious.  Anyways hope  you'll atleast stay friend with her, its always sad to end a long relationship when people are that close to each others."
crossdressing,3boefh,Maddy2015,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:58:12 2015 UTC,"Well to answer your question, it's a bit of a hard question just because ""related"" is such a broad term, but I can say neither of them caused the other. I'm sure they're related on some deep level, but I don't understand that because I'm not a psychologist.   And yes, it is sad to lose a friend like that, especially one I used to feel I could confide this sort of issue in, and in fact if she was still with me I'd probably be talking to her about my issues instead of posting in this board, but as I said, I'm 20. Many things came up in both our newly beginning lives. It took me a while but I've moved past that relationship and now and just looking forward to living on my own and being me.   Really, my being here isn't looking for approval. My friends all are okay with what I want, but they're all typical guys. I came here looking around for tips and the like because before my ex was my girlfriend she was the one that would help me figure out girl stuff and just talk about how it made me feel in general and now I need to find that help elsewhere(places like this)."

crossdressing,3biw8q,mousie74,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"Start believe in yourself. Take little steps, go outside for 2 minutes and see how it will boost your confidence. I guess nobody went outside for the first time to spend night in town or event go to a houseparty, everybody starts small. Be proud of yourself and be confident. And I say this, after going outside 3 times, boymode in heels and skinny jeans, nothing special, just outside my flat, where I can be seen by lot of people. It was in the evening, so little darker, but I've made it. Not very impressive when you compere this to other girls on this subreddit, but as I said, everybody start small. So compere my very little experience, to you, when you're totally beautiful, you should be proud of who you are, and the confidence will eventually come and you will know when this moment will come."
crossdressing,3biw8q,sissysarah84,3,Mon Jun 29 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"I have gone outside a couple of times, hated it. I did it really late at night, I was so scared, did not enjoy it what so ever, I felt like such a creep walking in the shadows.. I live in an apartment building with younger people, which means the odds of running into my neighbours is high, even late at night. The city I live in is rather ""small"", and the odds of running into someone that know who I am is high. And even if I somehow in the future got the courage to go out, I would have no where to go, but around the block which is pointless, so I just stay inside, because there really is no point for me to go outside."

It's been quite an amazing journey over that relatively short period of time.  I had hoped to put together a nice comparision photo between my first time dressing and today. However, I've just not been able to find the time dress since May so I've just put one up from my last session and one from when I first started, so any of you interested can check out my progression. If you are interested in seeing more I have put together a photo from nearly every single time I've dressed in this album.  For any of you left who might be interested in knowing a little more about me and my feelings on my crossdressing I wrote a piece on it on my blog. I'll get round at some point to posting the rest of photos of that dress ;)  Hopefully by the end of summer things will have calmed down and I get dress again and share more with you guys as I do love this community and you all. Thank you for allowing me to share my experiences with you <3"

He seems to agree though that everyone deserves to be themselves. I don't know for sure but I think he will be fine with it."
crossdressing,3bjnfl,pancakeonmyhead,2,Mon Jun 29 23:19:08 2015 UTC,"I too recently came out to my SO. She's supportive of LGBTQIA, but even she admits that it's totally different when it's s much closer to home. Granted, the father - child relationship is vastly different to the SO relationship.   That being said, don't let the fear of a reaction prevent you from coming out. Come out for you, not for the sake of others."
crossdressing,3bjnfl,thatladyjinwaiting,2,Tue Jun 30 06:47:54 2015 UTC,"don't let the fear of a reaction prevent you from coming out   On the contrary, for young people still financially dependent on their parents, coming out can bear a heavy cost if the parents are heavily trans- or homophobic.  Anyone in that situation needs to do a serious assessment of the likely reactions.  One study I saw reported on fairly recently says that 40% of homeless youth are LGBTQ.  Often they become homeless after they're rejected by their parents, or after emotional and/or physical abuse make their home unlivable.  Fortunately such dire consequences are becoming less common than back in the era when I was a youth but they still happen distressingly often."

crossdressing,3bigdw,bobwilc,6,Mon Jun 29 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing when I kicked my dressing up a notch last year. I would often become aroused, even though dressing isn't a fetish for me. Talking with a counselor I was seeing, he told me that my excitement from finally be myself was what was causing it to happen, and that once the excitement wore off, so would the arousal. Sure enough, that's what happened. As I dressed more often, it become less exciting and more of ""this is just who I am"" kind of thing, I wasn't becoming aroused as often."
crossdressing,3bigdw,el_cataclismo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:35:43 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. Now I just need to get into a position where I can be myself more often.
crossdressing,3bigdw,jassymine,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"Its just because you havent crossdress much before, happen to every CD initially but after a while (I can't really say how long, for me maybe 1year) you gets used to it and be able to control more. Its like DBZ super sayan mode during the Cell Saga: basically Goku and Gohan train in the Room of Time to be able to stay Super Sayan even when they dont need to fight and not just when they got angry. Same thing with CD, you need to stay in CD more and slowly you will be able to control your arousal! so the solution is, just crossdress more often. :)"
crossdressing,3bigdw,Lyn724,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"I thought my crossdressing completely a fetish, and at this point, I'd say it's like a tiny bit of one. I get aroused when I put on clothes, but it's very temporary and then I feel l girly and all comfortable, etc."
crossdressing,3bigdw,Hollied,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough (or not), once I fully dress, my male part always seems to cooperate and go dormant.  Perhaps it's because psychologically, I truly feel womanly, if that makes sense."
crossdressing,3bigdw,cee_zed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"Ha I was always worried it WOULD go away.  Yeah I'm still aroused. I kind of think of it as a kink and kind of an identity. I don't see good science on it but its like putting two identities into the one body.  When I go out, I go to scene events. Not sure I could have done that when I was in my teens for decency reasons.  For a lot of dressers I think it remains a sexual thing throughout life. If you look on line you can see people of all ages experience eroticism through it."
crossdressing,3bigdw,cloudnine_15,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:11:00 2015 UTC,"My fascination with girl's clothes started when I was very young too, but it's stayed mostly a sexual thing. Sometimes I'll wear panties or more for an evening to try to get into feminine mode for a while. But it's always just temporary for me.  Sorry, that doesn't really address your question, though.."
crossdressing,3bigdw,Boob-Philosopher,-1,Tue Jun 30 12:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think you should have another go at explaining the problem sweetie, it's coming across a bit confused? . . . from what I see you get aroused in a non sexual way by cross dressing? . . Is it possible to be aroused in a non sexual way? . . do you mean you feel happy when you cross dress or?"
crossdressing,3bigdw,Boob-Philosopher,3,Mon Jun 29 15:43:41 2015 UTC,I meant I don't do it to get aroused. I do it because I feel comfortable and want to be more feminine. However despite my intentions I still get aroused by the act of dressing.

crossdressing,3bftnn,xdresssarah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"I picked the best photo, out of like 20, to post here haha.  i'm sure this photo leads me to be more passable than i am.  i've been out in public before.  i'm in the closet in the sense that i haven't come out to most of my friends and family.  i find it easiest to go out in a city where you know no one.  that helps keep the paranoia down.  and it's nice to go with someone for support.  and go to a lgbt friendly area of that city.  i went to new orleans in the french quarter with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary.  On one of the nights, we both got dressed up and went out partying at all the bars and clubs.  i don't know if i was passing or if it was the welcoming culture of the city, but i didn't get assaulted or anything like i'd imagined lol.  no one cared and we had so much fun.  the fear that goes along with the anticipation of going out is immeasurably worse than the actual thing as long as your first outing isn't in a saloon in kentucky or something, y'know?  so if you ever find yourself traveling, maybe pack some makeup and a cute outfit!  also, the movies sounds like a wonderful idea."

I'm wondering that if they still communicate because of the children do you think it's possible your Dad has informed your Mom that you dig wearing feminine clothes? or have you made them promise they won't tell Mom? . . . If they have told her (which is possible) then maybe your Mom is just being respectful and showing a high level of emotional intelligence by just simply waiting for you to approach her and talk about it? . . . just a thought! :)"

crossdressing,3benll,lithiummethoxide,2,Thu Jul 2 21:22:08 2015 UTC,I just wanted to share that I recently bought more clothes and panties! I'm so excited for them to show up in the mail soon. I don't have much female clothes so it feels good to get more yaaay :)
crossdressing,3benll,Nikki_Tron,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:38:55 2015 UTC,I know what you mean! I love buying things even as simple as a new tank top that is in a different color to start matching differently. What brand of panties do you like? (If you dont mind my asking. Just curious and making conversation).
crossdressing,3benll,MattBinYYC,2,Fri Jul 3 00:01:05 2015 UTC,its all good - ask away! :) I just bought the 5 for $27 off of victoria secret I'm super excited to try them on since I only have like 2 pairs of panties. And also a pair of short purple shorts. I really need to get some bra's but I'm low on $ so it will have to wait :( But in all I don't have much female clothes.. Just a pair of shorts and some panties.
crossdressing,3benll,Nikki_Tron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:28:06 2015 UTC,That 5 or 7 deal they have all the time is ridiculous. I have WAY too many panties from there now. Haha.

crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"I did too! i've bought a couple before but that was during a time when I bought a lot of stuff that was way too ""feminine"" and inappropriate for my skinny male-like body that can't properly fill out tighter dresses.  This new one i think is a lot more reasonable in that it's modern & fashionable without looking like i'm about to shoot a porn video, lol.  Like you said though it's tough buying online because you never know the fit.  I took some measurements and bought the size i think will match but you just never know until you try it on.  sigh, maybe some day i'll have the guts to just go try on dresses in a store :|"
crossdressing,3benll,ana07,3,Fri Jul 3 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Are there ppl like me here? -- I wear skirts and dresses etc, but I do not hide that I am a male. I.e. no wigs and makeup. I feel transgender, but stillbtry to be myself. Society's binary need not define my self-expression. Best wishes anyway ."
crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,2,Tue Jun 30 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of like that I suppose. The main thing I care for is the clothes, and I don't wear wigs or usually put on makeup (except for lipstick). However I do love wearing heels and accessorising. I still feel great when wearing a nice blouse and pair of flared/skinny jeans, dress or jumpsuit though."
crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,2,Wed Jul 1 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I dress ""female"" all the time. But I don't try to impersonate a woman. Many ppl like it actually. Best wishes."
crossdressing,3benll,lithiummethoxide,2,Thu Jul 2 08:46:35 2015 UTC,"me too, i love everything. no wonder, whatever is nice is considered female. i rather don't understand cisgender men how they can be content by what is given to them."
crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,2,Fri Jul 3 11:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked that! I have been thinking about that very same question as most of the people who post pictures here are usually wearing wigs. I know this is a very supporting community, but in some ways I feel like I am a minority in a minority (ha!) by not going 100% femme almost ever.  My crossdressing merely involves shirts, shoes, and pants. I've always dressed very slimming for years and the way most ""womens' "" clothes are cut, it is inline with my looks.  Occasionally I get a bit curious about buying a wig, but it's never been a huge priority for me."
crossdressing,3benll,d89560,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"i bought some cheap wigs, but i would not wear them. it does not fit for me. it is ok to be male and not wear boring clothes :-)"
crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,2,Fri Jul 3 11:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way!  I go through a lot of effort to dress up, i shave my face & body hair so that there isn't even any stubble, i paint my nails, and generally try to ""round off"" any explicitly masculine features, but otherwise I don't think the finished product could be reasonably called ""passable"" in the sense that anyone might mistake me for a natural female.  There are just certain aspects like my fat distribution & bone structure that are a dead giveaway and any attempt to cover them up with wigs, breastforms, etc. feels too fake, like i'm trying to disguise myself.    Instead i stick to an outfit that feels like more of a celebration of my androgyny.  Which is in no way meant to say I don't support people who do go all the way with those things, just that I still identify as a male and present accordingly."
crossdressing,3benll,Ihliana,3,Fri Jul 3 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"great. i think that it is a good idea to work with what is available and not merely strive to be somebody else :-) maybe i am a perfectionist thinking that anyway i would not be the woman i would prefer to be :-D so i remain who i am, but in clothes considered ""female"". it has a political side as well: transgender in the usual sense does not question the gender binary. we do :-)"

crossdressing,3benll,thubtop,2,Tue Jun 30 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"yep, that's anxiety and I've had it my whole life.  A constant feeling of vague dread, like something terrible is just over the horizon like a black cloud. I couldn't even tell you what I think was going to happen if you asked, which makes it worse because you don't know what action you could take to course correct ,if needed.    The only thing that has worked for me to make it easy to live with is years of (ongoing) weekly talk therapy with a professional, no drugs or booze, and going for a 30-minute run at least three times a week.  A busy mind worries less than an idle one."

If the panties are being warn by a size 0 model and Have very little material it's not going to work.  I find that I go for panties that have a lot more material. Those fit better.

Standing next to a person who's a mtf transgender... How do you know who's trans and who's just part time and into the clothes only?"
crossdressing,3bcbyv,bsb2001ca,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:45:39 2015 UTC,"Gender is a social-construct. Historically it is one that has limited about half of the population and has allowed the other half to get away with it. Today we are finally much more aware of this, and I for one try my best not to think of gender since it very much so is a spectrum instead of a binary-gendered system. The point is, you define your gender. I wouldn't consider myself a ""male"" nor would i consider myself ""female"". I enjoy considering myself fluid and if people had to ask i would explain what the non-binary lifestyle is like. With that being said, i do love looking like a ""guy"", but confusing the uneducated as I'm walking around in skinny jeans, a slim-fitting shirt, pink-tinted aviators and my black leather purse."

Do not point the muzzle at anything you are not willing to destroy.  Be certain of your target and what is behind it.  Keep your finger off of the trigger until ready to fire.

Hair holds in filth and when you can't shower for a couple days/weeks, shaving it is the best:) I've been shaving all my hair off for about three years and only recently started crossing :) go for it yo."
crossdressing,3b7i3d,Wake_pandaa,2,Fri Jun 26 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"Go for it. I'm 33 and get waxed from the waist down every six weeks. I'm totally straight, married and a dad, and I just do it because I like how it feels. So does my wife :)  Protip #1: Buy some of those really light baggy yoga pants and put them on (commando - duh) right after you shave. It's the most amazing feeling ever.   Protip #2: Consider waxing over shaving. It isn't all that painful or expensive, it lasts a lot longer and you get fewer ingrown hairs.   Protip #3: if you do want to shave, use conditioner or Shave Secret instead of shaving cream. Again, fewer ingrown hairs."
crossdressing,3b7i3d,vinzclortho37,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"I can relate. My girlfriend is totally accepting but getting to the point of shaving body hair felt like a big/nerveracking step for me. Putting on clothes and makeup that can be quickly taken off is one thing but it felt like actually altering my actual body (even though it's obviously not permanent) felt like a hurdle. I was also nervous because I felt sure I was going to come down with horrible ingrown hairs, amplifying negative feelings. (Luckily that didn't happen at all -- exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate!) Anyway, I don't have much of a point other than I eventually just did it and while there was probably a momentary ""huh, weird"" moment from my gf just because of the differentness of it, ultimately it didn't faze her at all and at this point she probably barely even notices it."

crossdressing,3b4llo,cee_zed,2,Fri Jun 26 05:41:24 2015 UTC,Yeah its tricky.  I think you have to decide what you want and go for it.  Are you doing those things? Or is dysphoria putting you off realising what you want?
crossdressing,3b4llo,cee_zed,0,Fri Jun 26 10:06:13 2015 UTC,"I'm doing plenty of things. I work and study and am generally pretty busy, i just can't seem to escape this life. How i present myself would have little impact on my life other make it more stressful/dangerous."
crossdressing,3b4llo,cee_zed,4,Fri Jun 26 10:35:46 2015 UTC,I think vanilla people have the luxury of not needing to build their lives around their sexual or gender identity. So nobody is going to tell you get those bits right and then build the rest of your life around that. Because for average person that's bad advice. But for anyone in the GSM it's best to keep it in mind.  Even though I don't dress outside of occasions I need still need to build around it. I might have gone about things differently.  But I guess my plans now only make sense to me.  Yeah the whole dressing in public thing is still unfortunately risky. I keep to events.  Finding a partner feels like cryptozoology.

Of course I have no idea how serious you two are and maybe you'll be with her longterm and maybe not but either way, I would hope this experience (as well as the positive experiences of so, so many people on this sub) would help you feel like it's totally possible for a healthy relationship and crossdressing to coexist and that your gf isn't so crazy after all. I mean, we're all crazy in one way or another, and there are so, so many people out there who don't do things they want because of societal pressures, internalized shame, etc. You should be proud that you are not one of them, AND so should your gf for being not just accepting but enthusiastic about it."

I can't really give you much advice because our situations are pretty darn different. I've never considered transitioning and only CD for fun and comfort. Also, I've been married for over fifteen years now so our storylines have diverged quite widely since our 20th birthday :)  There's one thing I've recently written on another post here in /r/crossdressing. Someone was wondering the same thing as you are: ""who’d date a guy - quite strange guy anyway - who wants to be a girl?""  This CD thing we do isn't just something outward, it's part of our mentality, of our thought processes, the way we are. So even if we're not dressed up, we're still the same person. Our thoughts, motivations and emotions are still the same. And it's often those parts of a person that one comes to love.  As an anecdotal example, there's me and the missus. We haven't been ""in love"" for ages now, but love eachother a lot. And while she thinks my beard and hairy chest are attractive features, she'll also readily admit that I'm not attractive in crossdress. But that's alright because she is still attracted to the person in that silly outfit, so to speak. And the fact that I want to crossdress is part of what makes me my (as you say) ""quite strange"" self.   So don't worry too much. And talk with your girl. Communication is key in any relationship.  Best of luck to you!"

I only know you a little but you seem really fun and I know your great in bed. Sorry to hear you feel like your in limbo but it's very likely you will break out the other side, it's a complex situation your in so I can see how your confused. I think maybe you just need a girlynight out/in to pep you up babes, your probably just needing a cuddle and a chitchat to break the 9-5 routine. I hope you have a lovely birthday honey xx"

I'm not sure that I would be in a relationship where that ""spark"" had vanished but each to their own. I don't find mousies situation strange at all, what I find strange is why somebody who finds so much joy in dressing as a woman is trying to blame her unhappiness on the very thing she loves.  My point is mousie can have her cake and eat it too, seems like the hot date is coming so I have my fingers crossed.  I've been there, a prisoner of my own mind and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, I think Mousie would blosson in an enviroment where she could just hang-out and be herself and have some fun with like-minded people without fear of being judged, she is being repressed because of the ""small community"" mentality where she lives . . .

I can then clean it up a day or two later with a razor if I need. DO NOT SHAVE THE SAME DAY YOU USE THE CREAM...OUCH!"

crossdressing,3b18vc,chrkchrkchrk,5,Thu Jun 25 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"Good point. For anyone who's curious, MarWenCol is a documentary about the photography and life of a man who was beaten in a bar for being a crossdresser, so severely that he lost almost his entire memory of his life before he woke up in the hospital. There's a hilarious scene when he is with a friend at his house (after getting back from the hospital) and he sees a closet full of high heels and asks, ""did I have a wife?"" To which his friend replied ""no, those are your shoes"".    It's heartbreaking, funny and inspiring."

crossdressing,3b1fs2,Morethanalittlecrazy,2,Thu Jun 25 04:56:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well, I've never done what you're describing myself, but the calling ahead, asking to speak to a manager and then being as honest as possible about what's going on seems like your best bet. I guess I would also throw out there that, based on my sense of both stores, I'd feel a lot more confident about VS than Macy's. Lots of positive stories about VS shopping on here, I am pretty sure their salespeople are trained to be accepting. Whereas I feel like Macy's can always be a little sketch (in general; I'm not speaking from experience when it comes to CD shopping )."
crossdressing,3b1fs2,DunmerPrincess,2,Thu Jun 25 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any situation where calling ahead is a bad idea. If they're good then they will put you at ease even over the phone. That's good for you and good for them.  Also, you are not the first and will not be the last to ask this. Their job is to sell bras, not to judge. Sure, some people are weird but calling ahead can help you avoid that. There have even been stories of stores actually asking people to come around closing time and helping you while the rest of the store is empty. A sale is a sale after all.  As for taking breast forms with you, there are plenty of women who need breast forms (after surgery for example) so they'll know what to do.  A final point: you can always leave. If you are uncomfortable say so. You do not have to stay for any reason if you don't want to.  Good luck!"
crossdressing,3b1fs2,oox8ue0G,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"Both of the comments have valid points.  I live within ~45minutes of a major college town, so I think I might go for the VS at that mall.  I mean college kids are always up to crazy stuff (Not to bash all college kids), so they might be a bit more accustom to it.  I never thought about women who had to wear breastforms for some medical condition.  That eases my mind a bit because I'm not totally sure where to attach the forms to my chest.  I know the general idea, but if I drop the money on decent bras, I want them to fit right.    I am kinda hoping the SA are on commision, as I plan to buy several when I do go.  That would give them the incentive to basically ""shut up and take my money."""
crossdressing,3b1fs2,morecoffeepower,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:47:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't want to discourage you from your present plan; it doesn't sound unreasonable.  It is not the path I took.  I measured my bra size by following directions online and then bought a cheap bra from target.  It fits fine.  My only tip is to measure the band width above your nipple because men have bigger lats (gives us the V shape on top).  I also bought a few pocket bras from crossdresser.com."
crossdressing,3b1fs2,Kunavi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:17:24 2015 UTC,"Hello.  I know it's shallow but the best advice I could give you based on my experience, is go in and shop as you normally would. Pick a few things you like, try them on, ask the staff for advice on size. Have fun with the process as all you're practically doing is buying clothes which is always good fun. Be open about it and let the staff helping you know that the clothes are for you. There's no need to call anyone in advance either.  That's how I go about it, in a country where being different in any way, shape or form than the average Joe next to you, is seen as a legitimate reason to get openly bullied, mocked and otherwise harassed- Down to physical contact... The bad kind."

Having such a high profile person who openly dresses is awesome!"
crossdressing,3azicv,ana07,2,Wed Jun 24 22:49:02 2015 UTC,Ick.  I admire your strength and courage.
crossdressing,3azicv,thatladyjinwaiting,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:26 2015 UTC,It's unfortunate to hear but I'm glad you took it like a champ. I commend your courage for doing this publicly. I sure don't have that confidence. Reminds me of an article I was reading on noisey about a transgender woman who got attacked at a show with a transgender singer. The god damn nerve of some people. I've never understood how somebody can detest what someone else does to that extent.

crossdressing,3azicv,romulussecundus,2,Wed Jun 24 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"Awe. That's not cool. Can't stand people like that. I usually start talking some stil if if I hear/see things like that. In my hometown (redneck town in ks) there was only ever one openly gay guy when I was in school. I got tired of listening to some necks at another table talking crap n eventually snapped on them. One was a sort of friend, and after school that day I saw him walk up to the guy and say he was sorry. So yea, I would have popped that dude in the jaw for ya ;)"

crossdressing,3azicv,ZeldaFreak980,2,Thu Jun 25 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"Not picking, just not clear on something.  Does presenting as a guy in women's clothing mean you.  look male but dress in women's clothing?  I've seen two or three people like that on this sub.  How common is it?  Is there a term for it?  Spread some knowledge.  Please."
crossdressing,3azicv,pohlished-swag,3,Thu Jun 25 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty common. I'm one of three to four bearded ladies I've seen around here the past month. I don't care about passing, I just love the clothes that women usually get to wear :)"
crossdressing,3azicv,Kunavi,2,Thu Jun 25 10:22:35 2015 UTC,No worries. Haha. Yeah I mean I dress totally femme and have some stubble or a goatee whatever. Sometimes I dress fully with makeup wig but most times I just put on women's clothes and go do my thing. I'm not sure what people call that but I always identified with it being gender non conforming. I suppose its cross dressing but I dont care much for that term. I've seen a lot of other guys kind of dressing without presenting totally female I think its really cool actually.

crossdressing,3azj52,whosoevers,2,Wed Jun 24 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think you just need to try them on. Different brands and types of shoes vary quite a bit in size. This is true of men's shoes too. I have a pair of cowboy boots in size 8.5 and a pair of insulated boots in size 12 (I'm usually a 9.5 mens). I've noticed I usually fit in smaller size heels than flats, not sure why."
crossdressing,3azj52,verbenasFaros,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I love in a pretty conservative area so trying on in store isn't exactly an option. Even buying then outside of Halloween is a bit of an uncomfortable experience sometimes. :(  I am thinking about buying a nice pair of sandals since the heat is killer. I am just going to buy them in size 12 to test out my theory."
crossdressing,3azj52,DunmerPrincess,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think women's shoes in general do have a bit of a ""vanity sizing"" thing going on due to what I presume is an assumption that women don't want to think of their feet as big. I generally wear 9 in men's, so I ""should"" be 11 in women's, but have found that 9 1/2 or 10 usually fits me."
crossdressing,3azj52,_stiletto,2,Wed Jun 24 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"That's... two sizes in the opposite direction, lol. Maybe your real shoe size for men's shoes is different than what you think it is? It's true that sizes vary among brands, but not by 4 whole sizes... unless you're purchasing from China (because all clothing is tiny over there)."
crossdressing,3azj52,chrkchrkchrk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"Well, her 10s don't fit me. It would be going from a mens 12 to a womens 12. Still a bit of a stretch, but it's the only explanation I have for everything at the moment and Occam's Razor."
crossdressing,3azj52,MistyLuv,2,Thu Jun 25 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"In fashion, standard sizes are sometimes just a suggestion, and rules of thumb like ""add two sizes"" don't always apply.  Best thing to do is just measure your feet according to the manufacturer's size charts next time you shop for shoes."
crossdressing,3azj52,love2cross,2,Wed Jun 24 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second the ""try them on"" method.  I wear 11 mens, I have a pair of 13W flats that I have a ton of tissue stuffed in the toes of.  My Torrid boots are 12's and I tend to wear a pair of athletic ankle socks over my tights to snug them up.  Womens shoe sizing is very inconsistent. :| A lot harder to fudge sizing on sandals.  I have my eye on a pair of strappy heels, which fortunately comes with a sizing guide in inches.  If you can find places that have that, measure your foot and go with that over ""Size 12"", etc.    Good luck!"
crossdressing,3azj52,love2cross,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"I'm also a 12 in Men's and an 11 and/or 12 in Women's (U.S.). You can go to www.payless.com and print out their shoe sizing guide for both and try them out, or even overlap them to see how they match up."

crossdressing,3ax87y,Thumbs0fGlory,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"Well first, don't let your body stop you from trying it. Not all of us were graced with that passing look. (I'm terribly jealous of a few physiques I've seen looking through photos on here) But no one but yourself can choose if it's something you even want to take outside of your own home. I don't, I also think that other than my chest and rear I don't look feminine. But when then if I look in the mirror and I'm feeling it, I think I look alright below the neck. If I shaved and put my wig on I'm sure I would fell pretty happy about the whole package. You should try it if it's something you're interested in. The only one judging you is you (usually). You can wear as much or as little as you want. You can put on a dress, you can just put on panties, add a bra if you feel like (that bit is a little rewarding/frustrating for some), and then put on a whole outfit. Personally, I feel fine as all hell with a garter belt n hose on. At first I just tried on some panties, and they were not cute in the least, they were pretty much granny panties hehe. And then I put on a bra and it felt right almost. It really took me a while to go past that, mostly because I was still a kid. And then I put on a dress. I was sold then. It made me feel better about my life at the time and better about myself. I had a few more things, generally random things I got my hands on. I found a shirt that I really liked, and a skirt my stepmom didn't take when she left my dad, and that was the first full outfit I had. I was in my own place then, and had broken up with a chick I dated a while prior, so I would come home after work, shower, and put the outfit I had on, then do whatever I felt like. Only thing I wish I had was a cute pair of shoes.  Well at some point all my old stuff was taken from me (I still miss that skirt. Short but not too short) and since then, as an adult I've expanded a lot more and have grown to love this side of myself. If you are interested, start wherever you please. You'll know whether you enjoy it or not, but don't ever think that you shouldn't do it just because you don't have a woman's shapes. Bras might seem awkward after a bit because of your general lack of things filling them out. Well you can buy some if you want to have that feeling. I have two sets even tho I have a bit of a chest naturally. If you ever have questions on anything pertaining to dressing up, you can bet that any one of us here will be more than willing to offer help or tips or at the very least direct you to somewhere to help."
crossdressing,3ax87y,Ihliana,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:59:32 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you so much for the thorough answer. What you said about not letting my body stop me actually made me feel better about it. Secondly, I actually have a lot of things I'd like to learn about as far as dressing up is concerned.  I'd actually have no issue of taking this outside my house. I generally don't even entertain the idea of someone else judging me for my lifestyle choices just because I am different from what they are used to. I don't really have access to any clothes that would fit me in any way at the moment. My mother is a very large woman, and all of my female friends are extremely petite. On top of that, as far as buying my own clothes. I really don't know where I'd begin. Maybe I'll do what you did and just start with panties and a bra, I actually have a pretty good bust for being a semi athletic looking guy. Again, thank you. I was really worried that this kind of post wouldn't be well received here."
crossdressing,3ax87y,Ihliana,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"You probably want to do a search to convert your sizes over. I usually just buy from online if I see something I like.

crossdressing,3ax87y,ana07,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"Hi Bryce! Welcome to the sub, I actually turned 19 a few days ago so we're like a similar age :)  Personally, I am a completely closeted dresser, I'd actually say I've gone so far behind the closet I'm into Narnia. It is by far my biggest secret and I'm not considering telling any of my family or friends (except maybe my roommate). It's nice to have it out in the open, but I'm happy with it being my little secret.  I began when I was around 12/13. My stepmom had recently moved in with my dad and I was starting to like her style, especially her shoes and earrings. So I decided out of curiosity to look through her clothes, and instantly fell in love with the huge variety of colours, fabrics and garments I saw. I had the same reaction to her jewelry, shoes and makeup collection. Now every time her and my dad are out of her house, I always go straight to her bedroom and dress up. I keep thinking to myself that I will get bored at some point, but it really is my favourite hobby, and that's not changed for a long time.   When I'm at college I have my own clothes. I can also paint my nails there (something I really love) since I can just hang around in my room.  My main bit of advice is, how you feel when dressing is more important than how you look. If you feel amazing in a dress, cute blouse, jewelry, heels, nail polish, whatever...that is more important  than how well you think it suits you (which is often better than you might make it out to be).  Keep us updated on how it goes! I hope you enjoy dressing up as much fun as everyone else :)"

crossdressing,3ax87y,L1lly,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"If you're anything like I was at 18 you probably don't have much cash on hand. My biggest suggestion to anyone starting out is to make your rounds at the local thrift shops, You can find some pretty rad stuff there. Although for any sort of undergarments always, ALWAYS, buy new, you never know who the last owner was or their standards of personal health or hygiene. Walmart or any other large low price retailer is great for that. You're going to get sizes wrong at first, it just happens. So the less money you can spend figuring this out the more you can spend on more clothes later on when you've got that down. Secondly don't worry about your physique, look at the women around you, none of them are the exact same shape and size.  And third is have fun. Who cares what you look like or what you d on as long as you're not hurting other people. It's your life not theirs, fucking own it.  With Love L1lly"

I look In the mirror and I don't see that stunning 22year old blonde that's in my mind- far from it.     my window to go out dressed starts in 48 hours.  I have a checklist of things that are and could go wrong....the clothes aren't right, I'm too fat, will there be people I know still hanging around town, am I crazy, will my persona crack?

Now I sleep in a pair of her satin pajamas and wear tights under my jeans in the cold weather. Today we share an underwear drawer and its just not an issue. She wears some of my things and I wear some of hers !

crossdressing,3aw2uw,Alisonchainz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I had always had the thought in the back of my head. I had started out small with underwear before my girlfriend and I were ever together. One night with shaky hands I told her over Facebook. She thought it was weird at first and then one day before sex she asked me to wear a pair for her and I obliged. Well a few months down the road we are hanging out at her house and I asked if I could try on one of her dresses and she happily agreed. Now mind you this woman is very openminded and is bisexual so she's still thinks I'm attractive whether I'm wearing my steel toed boots or high heels. The best thing you can do is be honest with her. Hiding things will only garner resentment, or if she catches you it could lead to insecurities about you not wanting to be open and honest with her."

Keep at it :)   I've been hiding this from my wife for years    That's the first thing you' better work on :) It's a scary step but it needs to happen for the sake of your marriage.   In my case it was like ripping off a bandaid: ""Honey, I may look odd but I would like to start wearing feminine clothing around the house. I very much love how comfortable some of these things are and I adore the looks."" And that was that :)"

crossdressing,3atvry,Gdc1330,3,Tue Jun 23 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of websites you can find that show you how to take measurements and figure out your size from there.  However, I'll give the same disclaimer they do; women's sizes are all over the place so don't be surprised if two garments that claim to be same size fit really differently.  Here is one such link.  Not saying it's the best or anything, just what came up first on a search:  http://www.lauras-playground.com/size_chart.htm"
crossdressing,3atvry,Billie_CD,2,Tue Jun 23 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, taking the measurements and using each brands size chart is really all you can do. Women's clothing is anarchy in terms of sizes. But you may also find that the clothes in S/M/L as opposed to numbers have a little more flexibility. Since they're designed to fit a couple different number sizes. I'm 5'8"" and 135 lbs and a M/Size 8 usually works out for me."

crossdressing,3atvry,Ihliana,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"Psht. You shouldn't be worried about how your body is shaped, you can change some things by just doing the right kind of exercises and whatnot, depending on what exactly you want to do. But never think because you aren't built like a traditional woman that you can't be beautiful. If you feel sexy, you are sexy, and that's what matters. I'm not exactly shaped the right way either, although I do have a booty, but I'll be damned if I don't look in the mirror and not think I look good. Yea I sometimes think ""I wish my this or that"" but it's all just icing for a cake that's already delicious. Weird analogy but I think it works :p"

crossdressing,3as507,lizzyk001,7,Tue Jun 23 01:55:17 2015 UTC,"For legibility, not to judge but to help.  \================  This may be a bit confusing but I had to say this out loud and put it out there for others to hear, even if they are just anonymous strangers. I apologize for any grammar, spelling and punctuation errors in advance. I have never said what I'm about to write.   I have never said to a living soul, and it took a long time to even admit to myself, but with out further ado: I'm a crossdresser and quite frankly more I am gay or bi or trans well I'm not exactly sure where i lie, but I do know that I am not your normal straight male.   So let me tell you why this was hard to even type. I grew up in an ultra-conservative household where saying anything that was contrary to the word of God or my parents would land you in a world of hurt. I was taught that appearances are everything and that if it made you or your parents look bad, it was a sin. I'll be honest: I'm not quite sure where to go from here, so I guess I go to when I first started wearing woman's clothing.  I was about eleven when I tried on my sisters bra and somehow it just felt right, and over the years (nearly 15, I will be 27 in July) I have suppressed everything or tried to. In those fifteen year I have dressed on and off and always try to pass it off to myself as some jacked up sexual fetish. Along with that every time I would find myself attracted to guys, I would push it deep deep down never to see the light of day.   Although I will add as a caveat that I do find women attractive. However, more recently I have found myself looking at a girl's boobs and thinking ""I wish I had those"", or looking at her and thinking ""nice outfit"" or something along those lines.   The next thing i have to say, I have never said to a living soul either, but part of it is that I served in the United State Marine Corps and served in two wars but part of it has to do with who I am. About two year ago I was in a bad place in my life, and I took my pistol with a normal keepload. And I don't know why it was not and if I believed in God I would thank Him that it was not. Well I took my pistol, put it in my mouth and pulled the trigger. When that gun did not go off I told myself that I had to rethink my life. The first consultation that I came to was that I had to stop lying to myself, and when I did that I found that I enjoyed crossdressing and that it made me feel better about myself. As well as when I would look at hot guy and let myself have sexually explicit thoughts about them, it did not feel wrong anymore.   And now that brings me to a couple of weeks ago when a friend came to visit from out-of-state. I wanted to tell him so bad, but of course iIdid not. But it did make me realize that I'm tired of lying to everyone I know and everyone I meet. The double life is hard on me sometimes and I just want to be me, although I am still not completely sure who that is.   So this last weekend I got all dolled up and posted a few pics in this subreddit along with making a few other social media accounts, most just to pump myself up for this. This was really hard to write and I know it got lengthy and there's a lot to the story I left out. But I just had to finally put thought to words and let others hear me. So thank you and once again I'm sorry for bad grammar and punctuation.  Sincerely yours,  Elizabeth S. Kingston A.K.A AJ Newton"

The fact that you would share the pictures you already have, as well as this post itself, is wonderful and inspiring and I hope you feel as proud of yourself for it as you should -- many many people go their entire lives without honestly confronting their gender or sexuality questions! Doing so is rarely easy for anyone, and it sounds like you have unfortunately had an especially rough go of it. It sounds like you are in a better place now, but still having a hard time being completely open about everything which is 100% understandable and something that almost everyone on this sub probably still feels to one extent or another and please please please realize you are not alone in the least. I would also maybe recommend checking out /r/questioning if you haven't already as that community is specifically focused on people who are wrestling with unsettled gender and/or sexuality issues. They have a great list of resources on their sidebar that might help you. One in particular I want to highlight is The Trevor Project - if you ever need someone to talk to they operate a 24-hour hotline (866-488-7386) for LGBT people. And please keep posting on this sub! I have found it to be incredibly supportive. You can also certainly PM me if you want. Thank you again for sharing your story and I look forward to continuing to see you around here :)"

crossdressing,3as507,Billie_CD,2,Tue Jun 23 09:25:25 2015 UTC,"I second the recommendation to speak to a gender therapist.  As nice as the internet is, it is extremely helpful to be able to talk about these things face-to-face with a person in a safe space.  You might want to also check out some of the trans* support subreddits.  They are helpful and welcoming not just to trans* folks but also to people who are in the questioning stage."
crossdressing,3as507,pancakeonmyhead,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing an intense and deeply personal story.  Please, if you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself again, call a suicide hotline, or go to an emergency room.  I think we're all glad you're still here.  And I'm going to echo the thoughts on finding a good therapist who specializes in gender issues.  We're a pretty friendly bunch, and can serve as a sounding board and compare our experiences with yours, but AFAIK nobody here has credentials as a counselor or other mental-health professional."
crossdressing,3as507,love2cross,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"I can attest to feeling better after telling someone you know personally, rather than anonymous people on the internet (although that was a huge help for me too, don't get me wrong). For me it was telling my wife. The dual life was killing me too. I also grew up pretty conservative/Christian and had the same conflicted emotions. You can go to my post history and check out how everything unraveled a few weeks ago for me. :)  I am in awe of the members of the military. Thank you for your service, we owe you one!"

crossdressing,3ast08,sonyaCD,3,Tue Jun 23 05:44:15 2015 UTC,"Just remember: crossdressing does not harm anyone. It's just clothes.  As for your parents, that's a bummer. It happens that when parents are given the choice between their children and their beliefs sometimes the children win, but not always. There are plenty of people here who never tell their parents. It's a bit difficult for you given you still live at home, but remember there's the rest of your life ahead of you.   All I would ask is to be accepted for who I am.   That is the greatest gift anyone can receive. Accept other people for what they are and they are more likely to accept you. In any case, women come in more variations than you can possibly imagine. As the saying goes, for every jar there is a matching lid.  Stay strong, you time will come."

crossdressing,3ast08,littlemissfuzzy,2,Tue Jun 23 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Another problem I have is that I have never been in a relationship (thats not totally bad though), but I am so scared to tell my future SO about this, when the time comes. I know this is thinking so far in advance, but how could I be seen as an attractive man to women when they know I like dressing up as a woman myself?    Because, as you say yourself: ""All I would ask is to be accepted for who I am.""  Crossdressing is a part of who you are. It's not just physical and about looks, it's also about your mentality and personality. Even if you don't dress around your SO, you're still a crossdresser at heart which affects the choices you make in daily life.   Case in point: my wife is perfectly fine with my crossdressing, but she does not find me particularly attractive in my CD outfits. Basically I quite literally look like a guy in girls' clothes. But that's not an issue because she's not attracted to women anyway :) The thing is, what she -does- find attractive is me and my personality. The fact that I crosssdress says something about me and she loves seeing my personality evolve.    Can I really blame someone for not finding a person like me attractive?    No because taste is 100% personal and it can't really be changed by force. Taste matures with age and evolves, but you can't force change and the person in question can't do anything about it.   Best of luck to you!"
crossdressing,3ast08,_stiletto,2,Tue Jun 23 06:20:37 2015 UTC,"Thats really nice that your in a good situation like that. I dont see anything wrong with crossdressing, and i dont expect to ever change, thats for sure. I just hope to someday find someone else who doesnt care."
crossdressing,3ast08,verbenasFaros,2,Tue Jun 23 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'm only 2 years older than you so let's see what I can add...  It's great that you've accepted this part of you, because I don't think I've ever read a story where someone purged and it worked, or where they tried to suppress it with long-term success.  My family is my mom and her side of the family; dad and co. aren't in the picture. My mom was shocked by it in the past and that's a story in itself, but eventually she came to accept me and regularly tries to talk about it with me in all the best ways possible, but, she's still my mom so it's totally awkward. The rest of my family kind of doesn't have any other choice but to accept it. I don't crossdress around them because I'd be just as uncomfortable as them, but they know about it and have given words of encouragement. Still, any time anything related comes up, they all fidget, so it's nice to see that they're trying but it doesn't add up to much. If you really feel your family would flip on you then that's rough, and your best chance to start exploring this will be when you can get your own space.  I, too, have never been in a relationship. Yes, that fact drains on me frequently, but there's not much to be done about that for me, for now. I'm crossing my fingers that finishing college and getting a job and my own place will help with that predicament.  I will say, moving to or living in a fairly liberal city will help you out. Vegas is a great place to take a vacation for a crossdressing weekend (Still on my bucket list... then hopefully on my hobby list). Portland, Las Vegas, Seattle, San Fransisco, and to a lesser extent the Greater Los Angeles Area (where I live for now) can all be great places to be a crossdresser, as people there generally just don't give a shit, or they embrace your uniqueness. Where do you live?  You can try to be who you ""should be"" or ""are expected to be,"" but eventually that facade will fail, or eventually crossdressing will take over your mind in such a way that it'll drive you insane until you can provide an outlet.   If you read through my comments and submissions, you'll see I'm no longer in the closet, so this secret has already escaped the grave. It's extremely liberating, as crossdressing is simply a hobby, and now being able to talk to women about fashion and clothes and show off my heels is fantastic and amazing. That took a long time and a few trusted friends, but it was worth it, and being able to embrace myself has been very good for my self esteem. I hope some of this helps!"
crossdressing,3ast08,Ihliana,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:29:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sort of sucks being along all the time, but thats the way it goes sometimes :/. I live in Denver, which is basically neutral ground (even though we have a Democratic mayor and governor, Colorado is quite varied politically). And thats great that people are supportive of you, you look amazing in your pictures! Is it alright if i pm you? :)"
crossdressing,3ast08,Ihliana,2,Tue Jun 23 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about telling your parents now if they would be unsupportive. I know a year sounds like a long time but it will go fast. Work hard to put yourself in a living situation that will make it easier. I kind of regret not starting to fully dress sooner but in that time I finished college, got a good job, started a relationship, and bought a house. All these things make dressing much easier now. As far as finding a supportive SO, there are lots of people on this sub that have found someone supportive and accepting. There are fewer girls who are going to be as into it as you are but they do exist."

crossdressing,3ast08,Alisonchainz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well hi there, literally just signed up to reddit.   The first thing I'd like to respond to is about parents. When I was younger I was stupid, and didn't conceal my activities very well from my parents. Honestly I think I started dressing up because of my father. He was always very physically abusive as well as mentally abusive. Also the fact that I've had breasts my whole life (maybe an a cup) played a factor. I think at some point I subconsciously started wishing I was a girl, as then I (hopefully) wouldn't have been smacked around as much. Well when I swiped a bra and panties from my step mom and was later caught with them it opened up a whole new can of worms. My step mom wasn't accepting of it entirely, but I think she understood. My father, well I haven't seen him in about 5-7 years now. If I were you, and my parents still didn't know, I wouldn't stress to much about telling them. Maybe one day, but for now you will be ok. Try not to stress about it too much.   The second thing I'm responding to is the concerns of your future SO accepting you... I've been with my woman for about 5 years now. Somewhere in the first year we were under the influence of some illicit substances and i flat out asked if I could wear a bra as she was already playing with my chest. In hindsight that was probably stupid, but she accepted it, even encouraged it. She went out n bought me a few articles of clothing, bras (like the push-up I have on now that makes my chest feel womanly), and some undies and some other stuff. Since then I've ordered things from online (garters, breastforms, etc) and she's never been unsupportive about it.  Really what I'm trying to say is not to worry about such things yet. If whoever you are with cannot accept the other side of you, then you should move on. Also it will be better if you tell them when the time comes.  Stop fretting, all will be fine"

Better times will come!"

crossdressing,3aq3gs,verbenasFaros,4,Mon Jun 22 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky subject and really comes down to how you decide to raise your kids.  Unfortunately these aren't your kids so you really have no say in the matter.  It's mostly up to your girlfriend and what she thinks is best.  I'm assuming that he has primary custody and it's usually best to try to stay on good terms with the ex whenever possible.  On a side note, when my wife and & first got together she was fine with the dressing. she didn't care for it but tolerated it.  Then she got pregnant and the closer the baby came the less ok she got with it to the point of saying that she didn't want the kid(s) to see anything.  I agreed to not do anything around them (obviously not ideal) and as the years of gone by she's gone to not tolerant at all ... so back into the closet really. <yea not a happy ending, sorry>   I guess my point is. just because someone is ok today doesn't mean they are going to be ok tomorrow or next year or 5 years from now.  And it all comes down to what is most important to you."
crossdressing,3aq3gs,crushdvelvet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry your wife has become less tolerant of your dressing. I agree in this situation, its up to my girlfriend. She told me it would be okay after she saw that I had packed all my things up. She also offered to take her son out for an evening if I ""need"" to dress. That being said, I don't think she has fully considered some of the potential consequences. I have no problem hiding it for the limited time that we have him. It has made me think a lot about how we would deal with this if we had children together."

crossdressing,3aq3gs,littlemissfuzzy,3,Tue Jun 23 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"Anyone open about crossdressing with your kids?   I'm open with my daughter, who is six like your girlfriend's son.   The first few weeks I hid it from her, only switching clothes after she'd gone to bed. But then I started slipping CD into our daily lives: wearing yogapants here, a cute sweater there. She's now seen me in knitted dresses and in the negligé (various kinds) I sleep in. She goes ""ooooh that's a pretty dress!"" :) I'm not yet wearing skirts etc around her, but who knows.  Because of this, I also came out to (parts of) my family. My brother and sister are in the know and I wore a knitted dress/sweater over my normal jeans at a family gathering so others also have a hunch. That was to pre-empt any blurting-out of ""Daddy's got a beautifull dress!"" at dinner :p"
crossdressing,3aq3gs,littlemissfuzzy,2,Tue Jun 23 05:03:19 2015 UTC,That's really cool that you can be that open with your daughter. I think most kids would probably react positively like her if you make it a normal part of life (not something to be ashamed of). I think I'm more afraid of what certain adults would think if I had kids and was completely out. But that's mostly in my head and I'll get there eventually.
crossdressing,3aq3gs,MeHoney,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yeap, I understand how you feel.   I also worry about her friends and their parents. Yeah, I've opened the door to one of her friends in that knitted dress... googly eyes"
crossdressing,3aq3gs,DunmerPrincess,3,Tue Jun 23 14:15:07 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a father here. My kids know nothing. It's not something I feel ready to try to explain to them. And yeah, that's all about me, not them. There's also the fact that I live in an extremely conservative area and my kids have a habit of telling everyone every secret they're entrusted with, so unless I want everyone I know to know that I'm a crossdresser I don't have a lot of options in that regard.  Then again, I'm completely closeted. I stuck my nose out of the closet several years ago and...well lets just say I'll never do that again. Suffice it to say my wife was far beyond ""not OK"". I almost lost her over it, which probably greatly influences my views on the matter."
crossdressing,3aq3gs,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:09:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. That's a good point- telling a kid this is essentially the same as coming completely out. I'm sorry telling your wife did not go well. Right now I'm in an awkward partially closeted situation. I'm open enough that its becoming likely that the wrong people will find out which could be bad (very conservative family and workplace).

I think you may need to rethink your eye makeup colours when going blonde, with the dark make-up, dark-glasses and dark eyebrows the area around your lovely eyes is a bit ""dark"" . . . What colour are your eyes actually? . . . I'd be interested to see some photos of you in different coloured glasses, or no glasses at all, keep up the good work babes!"
crossdressing,3ao8lm,Boob-Philosopher,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:56:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! My eyes change color between blue/green and blue/gray. What colors would you recommend?
crossdressing,3ao8lm,Boob-Philosopher,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:27:02 2015 UTC,"Honey, I'm not makeup expert so I hope one of the girls can give you some tips.  I'm not 100% what it is but something needs adjusting to make you look perfecto with blonde hair, it may just be the glasses.  Your eyes are a very strong feature for you so it would be lovely to really make them dazzle, it could be just a case of having a girly makeup evening and playing with it.  So who is doing your makeup now babes? your girlfriend or? . . . do you have any CD girlfriends also? . . . I suspect you will be shocked when you see yourself in girl mode without your glasses! . .  of course you will have to put your glassses back on to see the pictures, keep up the good work babes! :)"

crossdressing,3aobvg,Jodythejujitsuguy,5,Mon Jun 22 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting! What a fascinating situation to find oneself in. These unexpected windows into how gender and sexuality sometimes intersect but sometimes don't is one of the really interesting things about CD'ing in my opinion. I can definitely understand why you wouldn't know what to think right now!   In my experience, lesbian friends often seem to have an interesting  perspective on all this, being people who inhabit the female experience yet also have a sexual attraction to femininity, which probably describes what many CD'ers feel like -- not to say that most straight CDers would think of themselves as lesbians while in fem mode per se, but that some combination of it is happening for them as well at various times in their everyday lives.   Anyway, one of the best/funniest compliments I've received was from a lesbian friend -- after I showed her a picture of Martina for the first time she said, ""Wow dude. No offense but you look way hotter than I was expecting."""

crossdressing,3amzgr,DunmerPrincess,2,Sun Jun 21 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"You look nice, great style and very strong eyes.  The lighting in these shots is very unforgiving though, if it was diffused it would be kinder to your skin.  I think one of the girls needs to help you experiment with your eye makeup but they are a very strong feature so with the right eye-makeup they could be out-of-this-world.  http://i.imgur.com/bZ1FrvQ.jpg  Whats your influences for fashion then, I'm getting a little bit vamp, little bit mafia and a fair amount of pink girly girl.  I wish I could try that dress on! ;)"
crossdressing,3amzgr,Boob-Philosopher,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. Any thoughts on how to diffuse light better? I just stood next to a big window in my apartment and thought the lighting would be great, but clearly it didn't really work great.  Agreed on the eye makeup too. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but it never seems to look quite right. I keep trying to go for a goth-ish smoky eye thing but it always ends up weirdly blue-gray. I put on eyeliner and mascara too but I guess it's not heavy enough because it never really shows up in photos.  As for my fashion influences, a lot of the time (like with this outfit) I'm just trying to let my inner punk/goth/badass chick out. I love your description, I think it makes perfect sense! A good friend of mine said in this outfit I reminded her of ""a young Lady Gaga before she dyed her hair blonde,"" which was an amazing compliment."
crossdressing,3amzgr,Boob-Philosopher,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"Hiya babes, sorry in delay getting back to you, hope your doing good.  You have alot on your plate atm in terms of learning curve, hair, makeup, dressing, modelling/posing, photography/lighting etc so don't be too hard on yourself by expecting perfect results in everything.  From what I can there is alot more good than bad here so that's encouraging.  Ideally it would be cool if you had a photographer girl/friend who could do your photos for you while you worked on your makeup and poses.  I think you have a great sense of style but I would still experiment with your wardrobe, the current look is sophisticated but to my eyes I find you a bit intimidating and would probably not approach you in case you shot me! ;) . . horses for courses I guess but I would love to see you in some lighter pastel colours and really figure hugging pretty dress, like really girly girl.  I've had a look through your photos again and have to say the hair is working for you and you have really beautiful eyes.  Its your eyes that lets me know what a soft friendly woman you are inside but the black and spikes kinda seems a bit protective? . . . this is just my personal opinion of course ;) . . . so I guess we can chat about a lighting.  Ideally you should take your photos during the Golden-Hour which is either quite early in the morning or quite late in the evening, during the golden hour it's possible to look directly towards the sun without squinting.  By shooting directly into the light you reduce the amount of shadows which appear in the pores of your face, by shooting at an angle to the sun you create much more shadow in your pores so without good diffused lighting this is best avoided.  If you can't take your photos during the golden hour then you can either make yourself a DIY diffuser from either a very thin white sheet or perhaps some opaque plastic sheets, when the sun light hits the sheet the photons scatter a bit as they pass through the sheet diffuser and the result is a softer more flattering light.  I think your gonna have to put a little time into practicing your lighting on a suitable object like an orange or anything else which has an uneven surface, then with your camera on a tripod you can put different diffusers between the source and the object and you will be able to see the difference but take a few shots anyway for your photographers notebook (you got one of these right?). You can buy readymade light diffusers but its not cheap and you could fix up something yourself as your needs are modest.  Another thing you can do is to make a reflector and shoot against the light (with your back to the sun) and use the reflector to bounce the light back.  I think what I would do to give you the quick fix your after is to buy/make some kinda opaque sheet that you fix up/hang from the window and then put the camera in front of the window and then you just face the window, pout/pose and start taking pictures.  The last tip I'll give you about photography is don't rush it, in the olden days the early photographers spent hours and sometimes days setting everything up and waiting for the lighting to be just right but fast forward to 2015 and we have all this fancy equipment that makes everything so much faster, however my point is that even though we live in a click-go culture the very best photographers tend to consider their image more slowly and patiently tweak everything just so therefore when they actually click the shutter button its job done, I notice these days some people can click through 1000's of images to get the odd one or two.  Work out your makeup, workout how your face looks the best and then just practice honey.  On another topic I would say that although good lighting and good makeup will work wonders for your photos you have to pay close attention to looking after yourself girlfriend! . . . by this I mean getting your 8 hours sleep a night, drinking plenty of water and paying attention to your diet.  Treat yourself to a nice facial now and then to get your pores all cleaned out and make sure you really clean all your makeup off before you sleep.  I think that's it, this is the longest reddit post I've ever done, interested to see if there is a limit.  Can't wait to see more of your work and I whizzed one of your pictures quickly through Photoshop just to show you how pretty you are and what lovely eyes you have! . . . big hug babes! x  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xor60ug1k9pxt8i/DunmerPrincess.jpg"
crossdressing,3amzgr,CD-REN84U2C,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is probably the most incredible reply I've ever gotten! Thanks for all the advice...I definitely appreciate all you're saying about how to improve the lighting. Doing it during the Golden Hour is probably doable, I'd also like to try to figure out a diffuser at some point too. I also should probably figure how to edit them in Photoshop better, I just did auto tune and auto color but that didn't do anything for washing out all the extreme pore/line action that was happening on my face lol. Anyway thanks again!"

It's going to be so much fun, I'm doing like a cross between a dilophosaurus and a Dior new look. Diorlophosaurus if you will. I've got a green top and a full skirt in like an acid yellow, and my makeup is going to be based on the neck frill pattern. I've got some bright eyeshadow shades to do that, tried using them with a damp brush too get more intense colour. I'm making a cape with a large stand up collar too!"

Luckily, I discovered that NYC has an ID card program where they'll let you choose your own gender without tons of paperwork. So by mid-July I should have a new ID with my female picture, an F for my gender, and (unfortunately) still my male name. They won't let you change that without the court order. I thought about changing my legal name to just a girl first name, my male legal first name as my middle name and then my last name. Then I'd be like Rebecca John Smith. So, for work, I could still legally go by John Smith, but my licence would say Rebecca Smith (just an example). Still considering things..."

crossdressing,3alyk9,lululemon118,2,Fri Jun 26 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, I come here because I need some answers and advice. I am female, and only interested in males and as you might guess, I am here because of my bf.   My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and he never cheated and I always thought he is ONLY interested in girls. However, recently, I found out through his phone (sorry, not the smartest idea, i know) that he's looking for a hookup with male cross-dresser. This is going to be his first time and he's looking for someone who has very feminine look but a CD. This bothers me a lot and I am wondering if he's gay but not ready to come out or is he bi or??? He did mention in his message (to meet-up a CD) that this is totally discrete. (What does that even mean?!!) For the past years, all his past partners are females and we have been sexually active (although the frequency for the past one year has been dropped). His behavior really confuses me because I really don't understand what's going on. IF someone was/is like my bf or has any experience with this, can you give me some insight? (This is a question that I asked on r/ainbow) I figure that I will be cool with him CD but I feel like he's more interested in gay? or idk??? (Or even he's gay, he's interested in feminine looking CD?) There're just so many possibilities here and there and I am just REALLY CONFUSED and anxious now. I hope some of you can discuss this with me. Thank you!"
crossdressing,3alyk9,chrkchrkchrk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"Many otherwise straight-identifying guys have an interest in transgender women and crossdressers. Your boyfriend's interest in crossdressers might be a fetish or kink, it might be a genuine bisexual attraction, maybe he's gay and super in denial, but you won't know unless you ask him... but he might not even know. Putting a label on sexuality is tough when you start blurring gender lines.  The ""discrete"" thing is likely just a shorthand way of saying ""please be aware that I'm cheating on my girlfriend here"". No matter the circumstances, you need to confront this dude."

Our rule regarding NSFW content now reads   No nudity, lingerie, or sexually explicit material allowed.   Previously it only specifically mentioned sexually explicit material, which I think has been a little too open to interpretation. This change is just a clarification to help simplify the issue for our users and give the mod team something clearly worded to point at when removing offending posts. Enforcement of this rule will remain the same as it has been."

crossdressing,3amg42,BiToTheBone,3,Sun Jun 21 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely think you've got the right idea with loose, floaty blouses/tops and tighter jeans or leggings, if you love your legs (and don't be ashamed that you do!) but aren't too keen on your upper body. My style would be to pair a loose, feminine blouse with some skinny jeans and heels. Generally if you have something loose up top, you might want to wear something tighter down below, and vice versa.   Heels and boots are obviously great for showing off your legs. Flats are fine too though, especially if you're wearing tight jeans or leggings already. One of the main reasons I love women's fashion is because it's so versatile. If you want to wear flats, but still dress up for a night out, you can add statement jewelry (a necklace, earrings, rings, bracelets, bangles, you name it) or a bold lip/eye, and look ready to go instantly, not to mention painting your nails, and different hairstyles and fragrances. And that's assuming you stick with the same top and jeans!  My advice with the short skirts is, if it feels good to you, do it! If you feel happy with how you look in them, that's more important than anything else. If you can hide your figure with a really flattering, loose blouse, that will look stunning with a mini skirt (again, loose up top and tight down below) and heels or boots. That will show off your legs like no tomorrow!"

crossdressing,3amg42,IsabelladeCarrington,3,Tue Jun 23 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"Well, you're thinking about dressing for your shape which is a start!   One thing you haven't mentioned is colour, dark colours recede so make an area look smaller, whilst brighter colours stand out. So if you want to hide an area (for me it's usually shoulders) wear black on that part. I like to team up a black top with a colourful skirt, which looks quite chic.   On skirt length - I think going too short is a trap a lot of cds fall into, it doesn't balance with the shoulders and torso and makes a very manly silhouette, unless of course that doesn't bother you. Depends what sort of look you're trying to achieve!"

But that's fine, because synthetic wigs can look really good and supposedly human hair ones can be harder to take care of. Lace front is some kind of transparent mesh thing at the front of the wig that supposedly makes it look more like the hair is really growing out of your scalp. It might be a good idea but it depends on what kind of style you're going for. Personally mine doesn't have lace front and I think it looks fine."

Try some darker foundation on the sides of your nose - it looks like you put on something the same colour of your face, but it just flattens your nose and makes it look wider than it is.

You can find my story in my post history. Now that it isn't a big deal anymore, I feel incredible, with everything, not just dressing. I can also walk by women's clothing in the store now without getting depressed for 3 hours afterwards. :)"

I've got to lose 40lbs so I understand your lurker status but I posted a full body shot where I know I look like a big booty mama and I hate it but it serves as great motivation to get more trim and sexy, also when your target weight is acquired you have great before and after photos which will inspire other ""chunkies"" out there to get trim too :)"

crossdressing,3afq1y,LeelaBaileyGW,4,Fri Jun 19 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"I've told some of my friends and I do post my stuff on my guy Twitter now (without officially coming out).  My biggest piece of advice is don't expect everyone to come with open arms and say they accept it.  People are curious, and even though supportive still might not understand why you want to do things.  That's my biggest take away.  A lot of my friends try to just hold in their ""huh"" moment, but want to learn more about it in order to just make me feel comfortable.  Have I dressed around them? no.  Do I feel a huge weight?  Not really.  In the end it needs to be you wanting what you want versus thinking their validation is what makes you want to succeed.  I didn't mean for this to come off as harsh, I just want to express my experiences and help if the ""worst case"" scenario happens. :)"
crossdressing,3afq1y,alicia2468,2,Fri Jun 19 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"Its all good - I prefer to get the real answers than sugar coated. So I appreciate it! I know some people wont take it well (especially my dad, even tho we are close) I've heard some of his conversations with my mom about gay people or similar subjects and I know he doesn't understand it and also doesn't like it very much. So that makes me bummed. But other than that, I know some of my super manly buddies will probably be like wtf? So I know it will be a big shock to them.. I just don't know if I can handle that metally.. Others I think would except it. And most of my roomies are girls so I think they would be ok with it.   My mom always taught me: if it feels good, do it. So I think I will go with that mentality. Honestly, the weather is getting nice out and I just want to wear short shorts and light clothing and not have to feel weird or judged by people."
crossdressing,3afq1y,alicia2468,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"Oh parents I haven't even tackled.  Most of the gay, trans things my parents kind of brush over (my mom always talks about my ""wife"" and stuff in the future) but I know there is also this ""sexist"" stigma in my family against girls.  My sister is treated poorly.  So I don't know.  I feel it's a problem that needs to be resolved but not at the moment once I'm still at home.  I'm glad you thought I wasn't being too harsh!  I feel sometimes people don't like my opinion (and alienate themselves from me) but my big take away is yes, you are the only one who can provide happiness for yourself, don't feel letting others know think it will make you happy."
crossdressing,3afq1y,alicia2468,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"thats too bad.. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it works out! I feel lucky that, well most of my family are pretty open minded and relaxed when it comes to gay or trans people. Except for a few like my dad and/or some other conservative relatives. But I really don't care what they think except for my dad. My parents rarely ask me if I'm dating or seeing anyone and they have never mentioned anything about marriage. So I think I'm safe in that regard. But I'm bi and I love girls more aaaaand thats a completely different subject I don't need to get into right now. What matters is that I am happy and right now, because I'm in the CD closet, I'm not happy. And thats all I want to be."

crossdressing,3afq1y,cee_zed,3,Sat Jun 20 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: While I did tell my girlfriend I never actually told my friends and family. It's just the way I want it to be.  There may be a way to do this naturally, but I have yet to hear of such a story where the attempts to bring such a subject up 'naturally' hasn't ever lead to 'we knew the moment you brought up X topic' response from the community. Most of the coming out stories that i've read revolve around just taking the plunge. Either it results in gathering everyone together and just saying it or doing it more or less privately (one on one or in small groups).  I would advise you to keep the following psychological phenomena in mind: people who don't have opinions or who feel pressured to give one in a social situation MIGHT take the opinion of others. In other words, if the first person to speak up shows a negative response, those without opinion might do so imply in order to prevent conflict with others and complete the social obligation to respond. If you think this might happen in your social circle, you might want to tell them individually.  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about what they will think of you. You say you're worried about ""being judged and looked at like I'm some kind of weirdo."" I wonder how much of this is your own internal worries, or what you expect from your social group. If you think your friends, family, or roommates would disapprove outright then maybe you need to be around different people. At the same time you never know how people will respond until they are presented with the opportunity.   I hope everything goes well, whatever you decide to do. There are also likely more people here who've come out to social groups like yours that might be better able to help you."
crossdressing,3afq1y,Lyn724,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:18:33 2015 UTC,"thanks for the input! I'm thinking I might tell only certain people of my CD'ing. 1 on 1 or small groups. I don't think I could tell a large group of friends or family. Especially since most of them dont really need to know anyway. And yeah, I'm almost positive most of my worries are of my own. I think its because I've set a standard of myself of what I am for so long, it would be a shock to some people. Because internally, I am so not the normal straight guy (i'm bi) that I portray that I am. Either way, if some of my friends don't like it then they arn't my friends. I'm sure most of them wont care, since most of them are very open minded and excepting (I live in a very liberal friendly city) so I don't think I will have any problems outside of that."
crossdressing,3afq1y,Lyn724,2,Fri Jun 19 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"There's pros and cons.  Telling relieves the pressure of holding a secret. It means they won't judge you on some things but will on others.  It's hard to say if people ""get it,"" as nobody really understands it so one can really say they ""get it,"" even dressers. Then there's the whole sexual hierarchy.  An annoying pattern as a lot of people will be ""good tolerant socially liberal people"" who will initially accept it but from then you will be either slightly ""other"" or even worth distancing from. You have to accept this may happen. It's kind of the flip side of ""nobody cares."" It's like they ""nobody appears to care.""  Expect gossip. All round you might need to expect that people may know.  People will say they ""get it"" when they really have no idea who you are. Everyone will make incorrect assumptions in every direction even people in the community.  To me the workplace is the worst. Most people will have people at work who will be openly negative about GSM. Work for yourself if you can.  But...its all kind of worth it. There's no stress if you are no longer holding a secret. You kind of pass on society's judgement from yourself on to them. Plus you no longer have to ""Gender police yourself"" as much.  Not everyone knows but if asked I would be open."
crossdressing,3afq1y,stacylynncd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"I could see that happening.. I feel like I'm in an odd situation, at least with my social group. I don't have too many close friends; but I do have lots of friends. The down side is they are mostly old co-workers that work in the same industry as I do. And I don't want this decision to effect my reputation. So thats one of the biggest issues thats holding me back."
crossdressing,3afq1y,Alisonchainz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"Sad to say I think people will still judge.  If you can find some form of work that will not judge you. Put your sexuality first and build round it because everyone else will say career first without knowing that if you end up in a super conservative office in 10 years with no way out, that will drive you crazy. Do you want to be gender policing yourself for the rest of your life?  Better to be yourself and not care if people know."
crossdressing,3afq1y,mousie74,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:12:34 2015 UTC,I def dont want to have to police myself anymore. That's why I want to tell people in the first place - because its getting too heavy on me mentally. And my career is very important to me.. so I've been fighting with myself about it for a while. In the end - I just want to be happy. So I will do what I have to in order to be happy!
crossdressing,3afq1y,mousie74,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. This January after finally realizing something was going on, I told my best friend (who is female), through a letter and then a few months later i told her sisters and brothers (because I'm really close with all of them) just recently I told a few friends and kind of just was really blunt with them. I haven't told my dad yet, but I plan to someday."
crossdressing,3afq1y,mousie74,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:07:52 2015 UTC,good for you thats awesome! How did they take it? I think I too will only tell a small group of people.

crossdressing,3aesxs,MyWeekendShoes,2,Sat Jun 20 16:35:46 2015 UTC,:)
crossdressing,3aesxs,carrie001,3,Tue Jun 23 11:50:53 2015 UTC,I care. It's something about acceptance and then getting the full treatment as a woman. I think.  But I don't - at leSt not yet.
crossdressing,3aesxs,lsimpson444,2,Fri Jun 19 21:29:09 2015 UTC,I don't care about passing in that it doesn't particularly bother me that it's obvious that I'm a guy when I go out dressed. But I really enjoy wearing makeup and improving how feminine I look.
crossdressing,3aesxs,verbenasFaros,2,Fri Jun 19 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Passing was once important to me early in my crossdressing years. Though I didn't have the finances to acquire a day's worth of female clothes when I did I felt discouraged that I didn't immediately pass for a woman. I want to be clear about this: I am 5'5"", 140 lbs cyclist. I have a beard, and a classic manly man's body (strong inverted triangle with broad shoulders) minus the well defined muscles of a greek god. I am not the manliest man there's ever been, but you would not mistake me for a woman in guy clothes. When I tried on my first dress, this simple fact could not be more obvious. My broad shoulders were very noticeable. I do not have a gender neutral physique. This was the first time I ever experienced what most women experience all the time, body image issues. I never felt more overweight, more wrong in my own skin than I did at that moment. It was crushing. Then it hit me: what on earth gave me the expectation that I would pass? This is not to say that I can't theoretically pass with the right outfit and body, but the idea of passing gave me an expectation of my body that was so unrealistic, so impossible, when it didn't happen I felt bad about myself. I felt like I had failed somehow at something that had only become an issue because other people could do it.   It's still hard for me to completely accept that I likely won't pass in my lifetime. The residual effects of that one time body-image problem I still feel today. It was so ridiculous I considered for a long time waist training despite that fact that my 'problem' with passing is in my skeletal structure at the upper torso level. It's strange how I think about feminizing my body when all I really wanted to do was wear women's clothes. I never started out with the idea that I would be able to pass as a drop-dead gorgeous woman when I was dressing, why did this become such a problem later on? So no, you're not the only one who doesn't want to pass. I'm sure there are plenty of others just like us too."
crossdressing,3aesxs,CanadianCasualCD,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:55:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. It's good to know I'm not the only one who has problems like this.
crossdressing,3aesxs,L1lly,2,Sat Jun 20 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"That all really depends on your general motivation for dressing in the first place. I myself dress for simple shameless self indulgence, and to take myself out of my normal mindset and unwind. So passing isn't really an issue because I dress for me and no one else. I know there are a lot of girls here that feel differently about this but this is just my personal reasons."
crossdressing,3aesxs,jijithrowaway,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:16:43 2015 UTC,I'm built like a mini linebacker. I couldn't pass if I lost 60 lbs. I love the shoes and pretty clothes. I've gotten good at walking in heels.
crossdressing,3aesxs,Zeusifer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. I don't care about passing at all. I love to wear makeup and girly stuff, and I love androgyny and genderfuck.  I get it, I mean, there's a certain thrill to fooling people, and I used to be able to do it occasionally in my younger days (at least unless they heard my voice) but it's really not a big deal to me."
crossdressing,3aesxs,BiToTheBone,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:04:00 2015 UTC,There's still a bit of me that would love to pass and although I know it's daft there's still a little bit of disappointment each time when I realise I don't. I look a little better each time though and I'm becoming more comfortable with me as well.

crossdressing,3aecle,oox8ue0G,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:15:22 2015 UTC,That's sounds like that could have been fun. Sometimes I halfway want to run into somebody from work or another part of my more restrained life to see what the reaction would be (but the other half of me is really scared of the consequences).
crossdressing,3aecle,tht_girl,2,Sat Jun 20 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"People see what they expect to see. The brain spends a large amount of effort to recognise relevant things quickly, and one way to do that by using various cues to cut down the search space quickly. So if you pass the first ""looks female"" test then they won't even consider the possibility it's you. Recognition is a largely unconscious process and easily fooled.  Especially if you are wearing a wig, make up or even just a completely different style from your usual clothes (which is probable given they're women's clothes) it's unlikely people will recognise you without some other hint (some unusual backpack, or your car)."

I hope you hear from someone.  I just had a little look through your photos and yeah . . you look really hot darling, so pretty, great outfits and shoes and your legs are to die for.  Do you play around with different hair styles like pig tails, bunches and hair clips? . .  Theres one thing I wanted to say and it's a personal observation of your posture, your upper thoracic back looks very tight babes so treat yourself to a nice massage or go swimming to stretch it out, there is also tons of videos on youtube for simple stretches, heres one you may find helps:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32E07vWRvhA  Look forward to your future work :). . that's all for now darling, big hug"

crossdressing,3abvjd,jawide626,3,Thu Jun 18 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe with your size you could suit a bohemian style. Like bright, bold patterns and loose, feminine pieces of clothing, accessorised with statement jewelry. Add heels, wedges, flats or even go barefoot, but paint those toenails and show them off with an open-toed shoe! And it is peak summer season and boho chic suits it perfectly.  But since you're more into 'classic' styles like rockabilly or red/black evening and cocktail dresses, then your tastes will probably be quite different, which is fine. I'd definitely suggest wearing heels to give you that extra height, plus they're almost essential with any smart dress. Red lipstick is always super sexy and looks even better if it's matched with a dress of the same colour (http://pixel.brit.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lipdressred.jpg). For accessories, go for the show-stopping approach with a cocktail dress. Choose a stunning necklace or pair of statement earrings with some bracelets/rings. Since rings draw attention to the hands it could be an idea to paint your nails too. This looks great regardless of what size you are.  A couple more tips: black enhances your silhouette and evens out your figure, so maybe go for a dress in that or other dark colours. And use accessories to draw attention to where you want. Wear bracelets/rings to show off a manicure. Necklaces draw attention to the...neckline. Earrings enhance the face. All of this could help if you want to draw the focus away from your dress size.  Sorry for the long post...hopefully I've come up with a few half-decent ideas :)"
crossdressing,3abvjd,ana07,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"The longer the post the better!!! Gives me much more to go on. Thanks for the reply, i'll have a scoot around the interwebs and my nearest shopping/city centre (which fortunarely is Liverpool so it has every shop imaginable) the bohemian look intrigues me but i do prefer the rockabilly type thing so will be looking out for a bright red one of them dresses.

crossdressing,3abhys,EllieRo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"Without knowing anything about the cut or style of the dress or much about your body shape, I'd say you should probably go with fits waist / big in the hips. Better a slightly ill-fitting dress you can wear than something that might be too small to put on.  Depends on the dress, though. If it's a stretchy bodycon type thing it probably won't make a difference what you pick."
crossdressing,3abhys,chrkchrkchrk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"Neither. Go for the bust/chest size, as that's usually the part that's out of proportion the most going from male to female sizes!"

crossdressing,3a858u,ChainedProfessional,2,Thu Jun 18 01:57:27 2015 UTC,When doing chin down you should turn your head to give a cleaner neck line...almost as if you're looking to the side or over your shoulder for a profile shot

crossdressing,3a837x,dgener151,2,Thu Jun 18 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Quite interesting and unique. The sets and costumes are fantastic. We unfortunately only saw three or four of the ""scenes"" as we chose to explore rather than just follow the actors around."
crossdressing,3a837x,girlfaye,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"I'm so jealous. I saw Sleep No More last year in May and absolutely LOVED it. Did you have any unique experiences with any of the actors?  If I knew how to use the spoiler tag here, I would.... So instead: POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!  I walked into the ""bar scene"" while a bartender stood around a crowd of people playing games. I walked right up to the bar and waited. He glanced over, placed 3 shots of liquid on the bar and 3 face down cards. Three people were chosen to flip a card, I flipped the Jack of Clubs and ""won"". The 3 shots were bait, the bartender went below the bar and took out a box containing another shot. Handed it to me and nodded. It smelled like whisky and it sure as hell tasted like whisky so I think I came out ahead there.  My girlfriend had another cool experience. She was standing at the front of the elevator by the actor and on the first stop, she was grabbed off the elevator while the rest of us were left staring blankly at the closed door. She was then placed in a wheelchair and a nurse wheeled her around the hospital floor while whispering things to her. It freaked her out a bit and she was eventually wheeled into a room and the chair was tilted upwards so she only saw the roof. Then a little light display showed just for her, talking a bit about the plot.  I found myself exploring a lot of the areas too, but I also managed to catch all of the critical plot points which I lucked out on. The final scene was amazing, did you catch it at the dinner banquette?  On a final note, you look great! I was actually day dreaming about doing the same thing when I was in NYC for the show. What a perfect way to escape and be unnoticed and en-femme!"

In September I'm planning a trip in girl mode and something like airport restrooms makes me so nervous. That's not a bar, that's kids and families and stuff! And in the South! But I have to pee! And check my hair and makeup too!  But, I've used tons of ladies rooms and never had issues at all. Most people don't pay the slightest attention. Everything sensitive happens inside a private stall.    Here's a thread I posted to /r/AskWomen a while back with this question. The responses were overwhelmingly positive!

As a long time nail biter (who bit from age 3 to 33), I was so happy with how they looked, especially with a manicure like in the above pic. What annoyed me was the constant fretting that one would get messed up (my left middle finger likes to split down the middle, wrecking the whole thing), and also that once they got long basic things kinda got difficult...such as typing, using my phone, etc. I did discover that you can get tips at the nail salon if one of your nails does get messed up. But typing...never gonna be easy. I like having them sort of long, maybe a millimeter or two past my fingetip. Anything more is annoying.   But, in September, I'm taking a trip and spending the whole time girled up. Before that I am definitely going to see how long I can get them, annoying or not!"
crossdressing,3a6o5d,letterstosnapdragon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'm about that long now - and i have a layer of clear (UV) gel on them to keep them from splitting. I buff the gel to dull so they are not obvious - have yet to get a comment, flinch or stare at work.  The side effect is that the gel is yellowing a bit after a week....time to clean and re-coat this weekend."

crossdressing,3a5f91,letterstosnapdragon,2,Thu Jun 18 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"Nice! I remember one time my female roommate painted her nails the exact same shade as I did earlier (Berry Stain by Maybelline). I was actually wearing it on my toes at the time, hidden behind my socks, after I'd removed it from my hands. I casually said I really liked that nail colour on her, which she laughed at before looking at her nails again and saying ""thank you"".   Sometimes I get quite jealous of how women can wear manicures. I would love to just walk around with pink, purple or red nails. I'd never get tired of looking down and seeing my nails look so pretty!"

crossdressing,3a4pj0,letterstosnapdragon,2,Wed Jun 17 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"For breast forms, I bought mine from Janet's Closet (https://www.janetscloset.com/), but through Amazon.  Janet's is a shop in the Detroit area owned & run by transgender women.  You can browse the selection on their website, but can get some of them cheaper on Amazon.  I kept it simple and went with 36C silicone, teardrop shape.  The girls have lasted me about 2 years so far.  Looks like there are other sellers on Amazon, but look at each one a little more in-depth to make sure they're legit.  Did you get the silicone pads with the LMB boyshort?  I have the regular foam pads.  To subtly show more hip, I cut two thin foam pads about the same size as the ones my shorts came with, then stuffed them underneath each pad.  If you have a corset, you may not need as much padding as you think.  I'm looking into a small corset myself, focusing mostly on Frederick's.  Happy hunting, Jess!"

crossdressing,3a50p9,cee_zed,3,Wed Jun 17 07:32:52 2015 UTC,"I must admit the phrase ""tolerate"" makes me cringe.  Who wants their identity to be tolerated by their partner?  But I understand the reality, interested women are rare. Being a straight crossdresser can feel like trying to have a gay relationship with a straight person.  Straight crossdressers overwhelmingly start out as closet dressers. The advice they get on dating is advice given to regular people, advice that is missing the crossdressing aspect of their identity.  Even when crossdressing is known most people are urged to hide it, hide it from, friends, especially hide it from potential partners.  I think that's advice from well meaning people that haven't thought through the issues.  I think crossdressers need to be picky. They need to be open from the start, preferably having partners that know first rather than going through the hide and reveal charade. Hide and reveal is awkward for both parties. It makes the dresser sneaky and it ends up offering the woman to make an ultimatum that looks a lot like ""are you a good person?"" rather than ""are you into this?""  I think the dresser should let them know first to avoid getting caught up in this game. Better to move on to interested parties.  That's probably not what you wanted to hear but I wanted to share my thoughts."
crossdressing,3a50p9,Honeybud_Reese,2,Wed Jun 17 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend loves it. I Think it turns her on, and she buys me things, and helps me out when we go out together. I find that a lot of girls like when i dress up, and are friendly and talkative.  I am lucky with my girlfriend i guess. I had another, who wanted me to be a man, but thought it was fun seeing me dress up every once in a while.  My point is, that most girls like guys dressing up for fun at least. While it can be harder for them to get used to a partner dressing full time.  If she loves you for who you are inside, I'm sure she could accept it on some level. She might even enjoy it as much as you do. Good luck :)"
crossdressing,3a50p9,lordthadeus,2,Wed Jun 17 11:22:11 2015 UTC,My ex only tolerated it. She never wanted me to do it around her so it was always something I did when she was not around. I don't think she was attracted to me when I dressed and I'm fairly sure she thought it was disgusting and fetishistic. So glad she's my ex now.

I think that's one of the biggest things that hurts CD relationships - your partner finding out something that happens to be a huge part of your life. These questions begin to circle in their mind, like ""How could they hide this from me? Did they not trust me? What else could they be hiding?"", etc.  I'm all for honesty. If your partner doesn't accept it, you should find someone who does."

crossdressing,3a08n6,kristiwithani2002,2,Tue Jun 16 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"It's an eyeshadow brush  that works well for blending.  The letter ""C"" can mean many things to many people. To me, it means ""crease"" i.e. the half-moon area above your eyeball. It also refers to the motion you use when applying it. For example, imagine that your brush is a pencil and you are writing the letter ""C"". Now apply that ""C"" by outlining the outermost portion of your eyelid & crease. With practice, you can achieve some wonderful effects!  Hope that helps. Feel free to PM with more questions :)"

crossdressing,3a275x,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"Lol I might be swinging through Vegas next week (Unplanned roadtrips ftw) but idk if we'll be stopping long enough for me to have the chance to crossdress. Last time I was there (My first time) my only irritation was that I couldn't be dressed in the city, as it was an unfamiliar space, being my first time there, and as I was not out of the closet yet.  Don't know what to tell you on the phone front. Most women don't have large, bulky phones, you're right, but if you think you can risk simply trying to hold on to it for 1 night, decasing it could be a good bet. Or keep it in the purse and enjoy the city ;P  My only difference in night/day makeup is black (for night) or brown (for day) mascara. And if you look through my photos you'd see I'm lying about that, but that's only because I don't have brown liquid mascara after switching to liquids. When I tried to use pencil in the past (and failed because I hate pencil eyeliner) I was using brown for day activities. As for the rest, in low light you're probably going to pass better, so try to avoid stressing out.  Wish I had more to give you! Just try to pack the necessary outfits for your suitcase."

I had this really cute leotard for a performance that was magician themed. It had pink and white sequins and a cute matching feather boa around the legs.

crossdressing,3a2ba0,MTV1994,2,Tue Jun 16 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience you'll have to do a bit of experimentation, but there is a way to get a good estimate that will help you find what you like in terms of fit and not style. Not every place makes panties the same way but each provides their own size charts. How to measure you sizes can be found with a quick google search. Carefully take your measurements (hips and waist) and compare with the chart. You'll find that either you fit in the waist or hip category, rarely both. This is where you'll need to experiment: either you'll like the way the hips fits or the way the waist fits.   I recommend using a sale as an opportunity to experiment with both style and size. Most places offer X pairs for Y price type events. Pick the sizes that you think would fit you best, the styles you want to try (both cut and material) in a bunch, and try them on when you get them. Your first batch is likely to have more fails than successes, this is normal. As a result avoid spending too much on panties it just won't be worth it. Eventually you'll have a sense of what you like and you'll be able to make better purchases.   Best of luck to you!"

crossdressing,3a2ba0,cheertina,2,Tue Jun 16 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"Thrift stores like Goodwill often sell panties that are new or practically new, with tags still attached.  That way you can get some cheap, and find your size before you start buying really nice stuff."

Also, I didn't realize the dress came with the ribbon when I ordered it (Thought the belt was just sewn on or something) but oh my GOD IT IS SO AMAZING!!!!! Giant bow on my back, it's like a dream come true... A dream I didn't know I had! (Edit: Oh yeah, and it made for a decent phone holster for photo-taking xD)  The cap sleeves want to pop off and I'm running into some putting-female-clothes-on-a-male-body issues because my shoulders are barely too broad for the dress, but it's slight and I can make it work."

crossdressing,39y7xo,KieranPole,3,Mon Jun 15 19:35:30 2015 UTC,Hey Reddit. So I bought this costume a while back and today was my first time trying it all on at once.  I was really wanting to focus on my breasts today and getting them looking as real as i can. I was really proud with just EVERYTHING today that I took and I think this is the first time in a while I have had so much fun when dressed.  I also think that my happiness shows in the pics which is rare for me and I have some pictures here that I think really just show how happy I am to be doing what I am and how amazed I was with how I turned out.  I am trying to get these breasts looking better so any tips on make up or anything to do differently with them is totally welcome :)
crossdressing,39y7xo,msjordancd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:38:22 2015 UTC,Very sexy and the look on your face is one of satisfaction and accomplishemt! You look great from head to toe!!

Keep the lines of communication open with your wife, it sounds like she getting used to the idea of her husband being more then she thought you where. I haven't been here that long myself but I've seen partners of dressers on here asking questions and getting a lot of good (piece of mind) answers, so may be that's an option for you two.  Once again welcome and don't feel you have to be the prettiest girl in school, it isn't a competition it's about you being you."
crossdressing,39xkw9,upholdyou,2,Mon Jun 15 17:38:59 2015 UTC,Thanks. I have been kind of freaked out about all of this. Hiding something for 25 years and finally telling some one feels great but kind of scary at the same time.
crossdressing,39xkw9,jenna_cd,2,Mon Jun 15 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"Came out (so to speak) to my wife last July. It was the most single hardest thing I have ever had to do (and I have been deployed to Iraq, twice). She was super supportive and while she is not interested in participation she is totally cool with me CDing (within reason). You have a special bond there with your wife; especially with her being so understanding. Do not force (or guilt) her into anything she is not comfortable. I, like you, am a ""man's man"" in the sense that I am an ASE Master Diesel Tech, restored our house, rebuilt my 97' Dodge Ram ect ect ect. But I also find deep satisfaction in dressing to the ""9's"", getting my heels on and being out in the world. It will take a unspecified amount of time for her to adjust; let it happen naturally. I find now that my wife asked me questions about her clothes and makes comments about other ladies hair/makeup that she never did before she found out about my CDing. So this is a ramble fest: be sure to PM if you need advice or have questions. Best of luck!!!"

Yeah as the title says I don't really dress up like this much anymore, life has been a big bitch for a while and I just haven't had the energy or been in the mood, which is also why I haven't really been an active user on here.. But I went crazy online shopping recently and I got myself some new outfits. This is the one of them and I thought I would share it with you guys :)   Also after 2 years of having stored all of my stuff in a black plastic bags, so that I could easily hide them quick, if someone was to come over, I have now moved all of my stuff into the closet (picture in album). I don't have people over often (ever), so it is just so much easier and more comfortable and clean. It also made me realise, just how much stuff I have gathered. It's just insane, I am definitely done buying new stuff for a while..."

crossdressing,39tn1f,AbbyCats,3,Sun Jun 14 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that life has been getting to you recently. We all go through periods where things in our lives mean we don't feel like dressing. There are even times when dressing can actually make us feel down. Breaks can be good, allows to focus our minds on other important things or re-evaluate others.  Personally dressing has been on my mind way too much recently. So the fact that other things in life mean I have had to take a break could not have come at a better time.  Nice to see that you have put your clothes where they should be, in a closet and are no longer in black plastic bags!  I had noticed a few comments from your recently, dressing or not it's great to see you back. I hope life gets a little less bitchy and more chilled out for you soon - take care :)  p.s. Lovely new outfit too, the pink and navy work really well together! Looking fab :)"
crossdressing,39tn1f,mousie74,5,Sun Jun 14 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks Abby, and I'm glad you are able to focus on other things!   It's kind of hard to explain exactly how I feel about it, as it's not that I don't want too, it is that I want it too much and it is taking over my life, and whenever I do, I don't like what I see in the mirror and that I isolate myself, I am stuck inside my apartment living a double life. It is just easier to try and ignore it and do other things, like watch a shit ton of Netflix."
crossdressing,39tn1f,thewaisian,2,Sun Jun 14 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"Sadly my other 'things' has been to throw myself into work, it's 8pm on a Sunday and I'm sat doing work for a client I'm sure I could do better :S  While I can just about stand what I see in the mirror I can empathise with the rest. My dressing is what I think about morning, noon and night and it's gotten a bit too much for me recently, it's affected my sleep and such.  I've just complained about my discraction being work but at least it is productive. Part of my problem with my dressing is it seems so unproductive, I don't know where it's going, what is the goal, whats the point. I like to know where I'm going and what I'm doing in life, I've yet to figure out my crossdressing and without knowing it's left me a bit of spin.  I would suggest you don't isolate yourself, there are plenty of people you can talk to on here. I sometimes find it's good to dump my thoughts more often than not there are others on here who feel a similar way. Plus since I since I've started my blog on tumblr a lot of my followers and people I chat to are transgirls and that has given me a different perspective to some of my feels.  There is plenty of support here and elsewhere for you, you might have a lot to work through but don't isolate yourself :)"
crossdressing,39tn1f,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that does not sound healthy, everything in moderation, and when things like this takes over your life, I agree that it is good to stop up and re-evaluate, granted that is much easier said than done!   I can relate to the thoughts on it being unproductive etc. I have had those thoughts my entire life. Even now that I've admitted to myself that I'm trans, I still have them, which is illogical, because it isn't a choice, it is who I am, but the thoughts are still there constantly.   I hope you get a more tolerable work schedule and figure out this crossdressng soon :)"
crossdressing,39tn1f,AbbyCats,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Part of my problem with my dressing is it seems so unproductive, I don't know where it's going, what is the goal, whats the point.   The unproductive thing completely paralyzes me with guilt. I dress up... now what? The times i've just sat for maybe an hour or so  doing nothing, staring at my computer screen. Do i play a game? Do i read? I just get totally stuck."
crossdressing,39tn1f,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"Haha. I know how you feel. I take some pictures, maybe watch something on Netflix. Then I deconstruct and it's over..."

crossdressing,39tn1f,kristiwithani2002,2,Sun Jun 14 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, Emma!  It's great to see you again!  You look adorable in your new dress!  I understand how both you and Abby feel.  I'm managing a crap-load of things going on in my life as well........work, family, my high school team, Hollie, travel, etc.  When I get stressed out about something, I often ask if I have too much going on.  Though, like you, I think about dressing, fashion, and makeup A LOT, I consciously have to tell myself that it may or may not be the right thing to focus on at that particular time.  The hardest struggle for me is giving up one thing in my versus another (can never bring myself to do so), so my focus then becomes balancing everything out.  I wish I could dress more often like some in our community do, but I have accepted the fact that I have to pick and choose occasions to do so.  On another note, I'm glad both you and Abby have been able to take breaks to refocus on things that are important in your lives.  I hope you both remember that regardless, you are beautiful and inspirational people inside and that's what counts more than anything, whether you are wearing a dress, a cute top & leggings, a t-shirt/shorts, or a suit & tie."

My daily schedule consist of work, eating a bunch of unhealthy food and Netflix... My life really isn't stressful in the sense that I have a lot going on..  As you say I might refocus, but I wouldn't call watching a shit ton of Netflix important, I'm kind of just stalling in life.. Because I can not figure out what to do with myself, as nothing I do makes me even remotely happy anymore. (Well that was depressive, sorry about that..)  Oh and I'll definitely not wear suit and tie, never have and never will ;)"

I hope you find a balance that works for you and your family.   I hope so too.  I would like to think I am doing so, but it's not easy.  I have to work at it every day and remember that there are others depending on me (like a wife & 9 year-old daughter).  That's what stresses me more than anything.  I just don't want to let them down in any way.  I would like to think that balance is the one thing that keeps me from doing so.

I understand it would not be a cheap undertaking, but I wonder if you saved up for it, maybe a few changes of scenery might help.  It does wonders for me and I've seen it do wonders for others.  In fact, here's an example of a friend of mine who saved up and took a round-the-world trip to get herself out of a rut (http://www.aroundtheworldl.com/2009/07/).  Feel free to give it a read, but start from the very beginning (July 2009).  The trip changed her life......and in a good way. BTW, if you read it, the 3rd post covers how she booked the trip..........I booked it for her.  Hope it helps. hugs"

I actually did travel, I backpacked for 3 months on my own in Southeast Asia. It was a good trip and all, but nothing came of it really. I saw a lot of stuff, but I was still the messed up person when I got home, as I was before I left. I hadn't resolved any of my issues."

Personally I don't see any pores in my make-up mostly because like you I have heavy beard shadow and need plenty of foundation to cover it.  If you want to give depth to you look I would say work on your contouring. A basic start would be to purse your lips and draw bronzer a long the line created.  Remember as well when it comes to taking a good photo, angles, lighting and a half decent camera are just as important as make-up!"

I used to be awful at makeup because of two things: 1) lack of practice and having no idea how to actually apply anything. And 2) crappy makeup. I'm not saying you have to buy mac or anything in sephora, but it does help having nicer makeup which is generally more pigmented. Maybe look for foundation that is meant to be more pigmented/full coverage.  Honestly I don't really like the makeup addiction subreddit. I used YouTube to help.

Here are a couple of youtube tutorials that might be helpful   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joj-0W5WyTA, this one is for girls with acne, but I would think it would be a similar idea with making heavy coverage work  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6azk0t5wvWI This one is basically what I do for an everyday look   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uSG7KT9zlE and this is an explanation of how contouring works and I have found it super helpful.

The harder situation is probably because my dad is cloes-minded, like he have some opinion and even you have got very good reason he can't change his mind, so telling him about crossdressing could be the most complicated thing.

Honestly, when she found my stuff she found some lingerie that clearly wasn't hers and that got her upset. However, we did eventually tall about it. It was hard to open up about that sort of thing, but my wife was more angry at the fact that I was hiding this side of me from her more than the fact that I like to dress. I initially opened up about it and over the course of a few more days, we would talk more and more about it until we understood each other."

It was really nice to have all of it out into the open. We have a kind of close/long distance relationship so we never really got to the girl's night thing yet.  While I agree with Lucybat that you should keep communicating, don't let the fear of 'her opinion might change,' get in the way. Communication is part of a healthy relationship, so nipping things in the bud is important, but don't get too fixated on finding a problem. Enjoy yourself, just don't get so caught up that you forget you have a wife who has her own needs."

I was after some green gel eye liner, which is maybe a niche product. Had some help in boots, which didn't have one in stock, then went to Kiko, which had what I wanted! Ended up buying some green mascara too.   Both sales assistants were super friendly and helpful, the one in Kiko especially when I told her about my plans for dinosaur themed drag!   So if there's anyone on here worried about buying makeup, just go for it!"

crossdressing,39t5qq,thesunisthemoon,2,Sun Jun 21 14:46:12 2015 UTC,"Crossdressing and Aggression Reduction  In the process of trying to understand and accept my possibly transgender self, I'm doing a bit of learning. As I read and hear stories from other crossdressers, transgender persons, and their loved ones, I seem to have noticed a small thread that some of them have in common.  Many of them have mentioned having periods of generalized aggression in the times before they became comfortable with themselves. A lot of overreaction to seemingly trivial things, general negative attitude, ect. Many people also report that after beginning their transition, this negative aggressive tendency seemed to abate, sometimes significantly. This same experience seems to be reflected in a few stories I've read online (including this forum), stories I've heard in the gender support group I'm attending, as well as my own very limited personal experience.  So, I'd like to throw the concept out there for general discussion. It's one of many topics that have been floating through my mind during this whole journey. I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts!  :)"
crossdressing,39t5qq,AlpacaJess,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"I've always had a chip on my shoulder, probably because I was a scrawny geek until I was fifteen. As I became an adult, my attitude caused a lot of problems. But things have changed. I think crossdressing does have something to do with it. I've been fortunate enough to travel and now crossdress, two things I've always wanted to do, and I feel more comfortable with myself. I still get pissed off, but it's easier for me to let go of the anger."
crossdressing,39t5qq,Aenonn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"Aggression, negativity, (other) may be rooted in frustration in not being able to express self, or even a feeling of lacking something and not knowing what. Or a third thing that is not that general, but very specific to the individual.  What ever the case, as self-aware adults, we can examine our behavior, look inside for the root of it and just try and be honest with ourselves.  Sometimes, people need to learn, or be shown how to 'look inside.' I went to a counselor for a while in my early 20s. While 'we' never got to the 'root of my issues' - it did give me more clues on researching the how-to of self examination, evaluation. From there I asked myself those questions.  Now: Change. Rather ""Self-change."" That is difficult because like any other habit, it's your ""go to emotion"" or ""Go to Outlook."" Reacting with anger, or teeth gritting, snide commentary... changing that is HARD. It takes time, effort and a full commitment to change those habits. Don't despair, it CAN be done, if you want it bad enough.  All I can say is Don't give up on yourself!!  Whew...I ran on there... I'll take my soap-box and go.  (: /"

crossdressing,39t5qq,LeelaBaileyGW,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:12:00 2015 UTC,So where's a good place to buy clothes? Does everyone just buy online or do they prefer to go to a store to try things on?
crossdressing,39t5qq,letterstosnapdragon,2,Tue Jun 16 22:44:36 2015 UTC,If you don't know exactly what you're getting then you can get seriously ripped off buying clothes online. Especially since so many Chinese manufacturers starting practically spam posting on eBay/Amazon.   Try thrift shops! They are a great option for picking up wardrobe items super cheap. That gives you the freedom of trying lots of things and seeing what works for you.
crossdressing,39t5qq,LeelaBaileyGW,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:28:42 2015 UTC,yeah I can see that happening.. But the thrift store sounds like a good idea. Now if I could only find some fellow CD's to go shopping with I wouldn't feel so awkward :/
crossdressing,39t5qq,ana07,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:32:31 2015 UTC,"Bought most of my clothes from Primark (UK-based cheap/fast-fashion retailer). My heels, bomber jacket, blouse, skinny jeans, necklaces and bracelets are all from there. The quality isn't that great but dressing up in women's clothes, shoes and jewelry is too fun for me to care! Besides that I bought my makeup and nail polish from a local store with a self-service checkout to avoid awkward situations, and I got my earrings from a slightly more expensive retailer (River Island).  I would shop online but my parents check my card history occasionally, and I don't want to leave any clues. Unless I have vouchers, then I can shop online all I want :)"

Online is just easier, because there is so much more choice, they ship it to your house, you can try everything at home... test-drive different outfits.  Going to a store and shopping in general (with friends) is just much more fun. Going in and out of stores... getting immediate feedback... finding unexpected bargains. And then having lunch or dinner with friends.  Outdoor shopping for me is about having a good time. :)"

crossdressing,39t5qq,alicia2468,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"More a question for the mods, (because I'm not too familiar how reddit and privacy works) and I will delete this if it's false since I don't want to spread false information.  I was in conversation with someone as I was told that the subreddit actually can redirect to r/all where the general populous can see.  Is that true?  I know of the risks of the internet where posting and stuff already regardless is dicey, but I was just kind of confused to hear especially if people want more privacy in their posting.  Is there any option to not redirect there or would it change something in the subreddit?"
crossdressing,39t5qq,alicia2468,3,Fri Jun 19 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, /r/crossdressing does appear on the /r/all feed, it's an option that's enabled by default. I've thought about disabling it, but we're not making posts with 3K+ upvotes nor are we ever in the running to be a trending subreddit so it's not like we've got a spotlight shining on us. Only folks browsing /r/all/new will ever be likely to see posts from here (and we've had people leave comments saying that's where they came from) but I'd wager it's a pretty small amount of traffic.  I like to think that a small amount of public access is good - it's a chance to show the ""normal"" side of crossdressing to the curious, and also maybe someone who belongs here will accidentally stumble across it? I dunno. At any rate, we've got 12K subscribers, so whats a couple more :P  But if this makes users here uncomfortable, I don't see a problem with disabling it. Gotta say you're the first person I've had even mention it so far, though. Maybe a quick straw poll is in order. In the meantime, there's always /r/cdsafehaven."
crossdressing,39t5qq,Aenonn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:43:27 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks! I can definitely see the positives a bit more now in the sense it is advertising to someone who might be a bit shy and might stumble upon it and  might consider if it is for them.

But I really recommend moving away from Arabian style liner unless you KNOW you have the skill to apply it with liquid liner, and can finish out the wings in just the right shape. If you're just using a pencil, go over the top, and maybe a tiny bit under your eye. It'll make your eyes seem less round and give it a more effeminate and slim look."

Now, I only need a checkered blouse. :)  The desert is really the opposite of the Netherlands! We're surrounded by the North Sea, a number of internal lakes and huge rivers. Half our country is under sea level.. so if the dykes and dams don't hold it.. it will get wet and cold quite quickly! :-P"

crossdressing,39rn1b,LexiForNow,3,Sun Jun 14 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"First, and this is important, coming out is almost always better than being in the closet. The freedom that comes with not having to hide everything is quite wonderful.  That being said, if you do have to keep things hidden, consider hiding things in plain sight. It depends on what you have to hide, but I, for example, am a big gamer. I would hide my panties in empty magic the gathering playing card boxes (the large fat packs). I also have outfits hidden amongst old clothes hanging in my closet. If you have a suit in a zip up protection bag that is a great place to hide things. I've hidden shoes in desk drawers and underneath the couches in my basement where I hang out. Consider other places where family members generally don't go, so if your mom has a habit of cleaning up your clothes or poking about your room, be careful of leaving things lying it about.   No hiding place is perfect so coming out is truly the best option."

crossdressing,39pes2,CynthiaLaFleur,2,Sat Jun 13 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"I have that same problem... my left foot is slightly larger (not a full size though). And my size is actually 39.5, so it's either 39 or 40.  It depends on the type of shoe and the material. Leather and suede will stretch.. so I will just usually go for 39.. and wear the shoes until they are comfy.  With boots and strappy heels.. I usually go for 40.  Michelle Phan has a great YouTube tutorial on how to stretch your shoes by placing small bags of water in the shoes.. and then freezing them."
crossdressing,39pes2,natcrys,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:26:36 2015 UTC,Most people's feet are slightly differently sized. My right foot is roughly a 1/2 size larger than my left one. It depends on the shoe which size to get but remember that nylons are slimmer and socks are thicker; use each as needed for the size you're wearing.

crossdressing,39o4f1,pohlished-swag,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:31:56 2015 UTC,"Amen to the nail polish. If I could wear it all the time I would, it's such a shame I can only wear it locked in my room."

crossdressing,39o4f1,ana07,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"well men's clothes literally don't fit me cause i'm small and fuk american sizes, but that's not really why as much as it is the way female clothes feel and how it makes you feel"
crossdressing,39o4f1,cthulhumysterio,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"yes, at least partially"
crossdressing,39o4f1,taylor-cdgirl,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:08:36 2015 UTC,As my username suggests I crossdress casually. Mostly it's underdressing with the occasional Homme Mystere bra. Yeah it's technically not crossdressing but they fit my torso properly without puffing out my chest unnecessarily. I also have a very inverted triangle shape so getting men's clothes that fit can be a pain. I do find some women's wear fit me better since they have smaller waists. Sometimes I'll blend my guy clothes with girl clothes. Does it fit better? sometimes. I like wearing whatever I want because it looks good on me.
crossdressing,39o4f1,CanadianCasualCD,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:48:30 2015 UTC,I do it because it makes me feel good.   Although I do like the way female clothes fit.They are a lot more tight and fitting.
crossdressing,39o4f1,peartrans,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:01:34 2015 UTC,"I am a natural 46B and male clothes don't fit my chest.  I put on a bra and then blouses, stretchy tops and dresses fit a lot better than the normal male clothes.  I am still a size 26-28 and not everything in those sizes are for a B cup. I know, first world problems."
crossdressing,39mjel,intothegarbagechute,2,Fri Jun 12 20:07:33 2015 UTC,"AAH! I'm not alone. I love lulus. I wear almost all their non legging pants just as per normal in guy mode. I don't have a big frame to me, and maybe thus my package isn't giant like some of the male lulu models they have online, so i really don't have much more of a bump in front than my gf does."
crossdressing,39mjel,bsb2001ca,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:48:27 2015 UTC,Fantastic! Is the feel better than normal leggings?
crossdressing,39mjel,Tverskaya,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"It's a bit different than other pairs I have, maybe stretchier and holds its shape better. The wide waistband makes them fit better and make my butt look reallllly good ;)"
crossdressing,39mjel,Bobsli,3,Fri Jun 12 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"I can agree, your bum does look realllllly good ;))"
crossdressing,39mjel,bsb2001ca,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"I find once you go lulu, it's hard to go elsewhere just cause of the feel and look. Some leggings look shiny and kinda really fake looking, but some how they don't and feel super soft."
crossdressing,39mjel,bsb2001ca,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:49:36 2015 UTC,"If you want them to last and feel like new, best thing you can do is wash them alone (or with other lulu products only) and then let them hang dry. The tag usually says it can dry on low heat, but I find that some dryers are too warm still and can make them feel used after awhile. I've been washing on cold and hang dry my most recent pair of pants and they still have the shape, feel, and elasticity of new pants."
crossdressing,39mjel,tinariddle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:59:48 2015 UTC,Didn't realize these were a big deal. Hahah! Good to know I can now find quality leggings/yoga pants. I was never really a brand shopper...
crossdressing,39mjel,CDFantasy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:29:04 2015 UTC,How did you buy them - Did you try on in store? Or did you buy a few sizes online and return the ones too big/small?  Just curious as I'd love to have a pair myself :)
crossdressing,39mjel,bsb2001ca,2,Sat Jun 13 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"I been shopping there for a while. I would just try them on. The brand is very anti/non judgemental. I was finding patterns for my gf, and in a certain size and there's always someone at the pants area and she asked if I wanted to try any of them on, or needed help. Honestly I don't think lulus and guys are that shocking just based on how casual she asked it, and based on their feedback website. So many guys buy the women's line cause the men's line kinda sucks for guys that do actually yoga. The guys line is more like gym work outs or running. Anytime the ""fit changes"" like if they change the design you have to see if your still the same size."

But if you're concerned about it, you can play down your shoulders and arms with strategic clothing choices. Notice how the spaghetti straps and broad neckline of your top in the first pic accentuate your chest and shoulders, whereas the deep V of the other top helps draw the eye elsewhere.

crossdressing,39jc2a,MrPirateman,3,Fri Jun 12 03:09:37 2015 UTC,Luckily 11s should not be that hard to find.  Payless is a great source for sizes up to 13 and I have really liked DSW lately for some nicer stuff.
crossdressing,39jc2a,cdnicole,2,Fri Jun 12 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"Famous Footwear definitely has size 11 as well.  Payless, DSW, and Shoe Carnival (not sure if they're in SoCal) work too."
crossdressing,39jc2a,Hollied,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:04:17 2015 UTC,Payless is my go yo.  Online or in the store.
crossdressing,39jc2a,curiousbrandi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:22:46 2015 UTC,I have found with my size 10.5 in men's that I can easily fit into an 11 wide and wear them for an extended period of time. Great places for wide width shoes are like torrid a plus sized women's clothing store and debs. If you can find others I'm sure the rest of us would love to hear about them. Oh by the way check your local second hand stores I found two pair of sluty heels this last Monday and only paid $12 for the two

crossdressing,39ejlt,love2cross,3,Thu Jun 11 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"This all sounds so very familiar.  After two-and-a-half decades of living in shame after being found out and disowned by (what I thought were) close friends, I spilled the beans to a close lady friend a couple years back. Essentially, I do comedy, and I dress, and I embarked on a plan to combine the two.  Last October, I introduced a female character in a very public comedy venue. She's gone up another 7-8 times since and has been well received.  After that first time -- which was the most difficult thing I've ever done -- I started letting other people close to me know what I'm up to, and they couldn't be more supportive. You're not kidding it feels good.  Congratulations on everything great happening in your world!  Edit: While re-reading this post, I realized I left out the most important point: being able to be who you are and go out and interact with people without fear is the most incredible thing you can experience. I am so thankful to have found my way and have so many people support me."
crossdressing,39ejlt,thehalfwit,2,Thu Jun 11 09:05:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment! I remember seeing a few of your videos you've posted. I admire your bravery too. I'm still switching gears and getting used not feeling so guilty about it.
crossdressing,39ejlt,mousie74,4,Thu Jun 11 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"Not to be a downer but i'm just feeling like i have to share.  I came out to my family and one of my closest friends and i'm beginning to wish i hadn't. While i now have the freedom to do it a bit more (i still keep it quite private) i feel like every decision i make is scrutinized based on my crossdressing. I lost some weight recently, the first thing my mom asked ""Is it cause of... your hobby?""   I can see one of my friends constantly scanning my face for signs for makeup when i talk to her and usually looks for an excuse to counsel me on it when i just wanna hang out.  My sister seems the only one who doesn't truly give a shit."
crossdressing,39ejlt,AbbyCats,2,Thu Jun 11 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"You're not being a downer. It's good to talk about our frustrations right? I'm sorry to hear about that though. I hope it doesn't turn into that for me. I haven't told my parents or siblings. Only a select few know so far, and I only told them because they've already shared secrets about their lives/marriages with us in the past. So we have some established trust."
crossdressing,39ejlt,mousie74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"The scrutiny is one of the main reasons why I do not want to come out. I feel like every move I make is already heavy analysed, adding crossdressing as another layer might be more than I can bare.  Likewise my weight is already an issue for some and if I came out as a crossdresser I'm sure my parents especially would be convinced I have an eating disorder."
crossdressing,39ejlt,AbbyCats,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:29:15 2015 UTC,"My weight became such an issue i eventually gave in and ended up going to the Doctors, i have a very energetic job, its no mystery why i've lost weight. Guess what? I'm a perfectly healthy weight and got some blood tests done too to rule anything out."
crossdressing,39ejlt,mousie74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"While I've never been driven to see the doctor I have checked my weight against various health checks and I'm normal in all, not even close to underweight. I think my problem comes from being over weight for much of my life.  Since I lost the weight to those around me the physical change has been dramatic and I don't think, even after a good number of years, they've been able to truly reconcile the difference in my appearance. From a large unhealthy size to a normal healthy one."
crossdressing,39ejlt,AbbyCats,0,Thu Jun 11 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I used to be overweight too  I'm gonna sound like a real bitch too now, but all the comments about my weight are from overweight people. A lot of my friends are generally happy for me and think i look good slim."
crossdressing,39ejlt,mousie74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"Snap, although rather than friends the worst culprit is my Dad, who due to his own weight problems is borderline diabetic. I worry about him too, so any discussion about weight can lead to quite heated words."

crossdressing,39ejlt,Hollied,2,Thu Jun 11 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I actually forgot to have fun when I was out. I was pretty terrified, combined with thinking I was losing everything back home as a direct result of my night out (turned out to be the opposite! After just a few days of talking with my wife, it has actually strengthened our marriage)."
crossdressing,39ejlt,Hollied,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:55:45 2015 UTC,Well at least the scary part is over! Now you can just have fun!

crossdressing,39ejlt,tinariddle,2,Thu Jun 11 06:10:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, Jadine and Pedro did an excellent job!  However, you didn't do too badly yourself either.........that dress looks amazing on you!  The photos you posted look amazing!  I'm glad you got to connect with Viv while you were there......sounds like she and your brother-in-law were huge in setting your mind at ease.  I usually get to Vegas at least once or twice a year (only 4.5-hr drive for me), but have not been able to do so as Hollie yet.  One of these days......  If you ever get to the Phoenix area and have time for a girls' day/night, feel free to contact me."
crossdressing,39ejlt,tinariddle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:03:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Literally everybody that I came into contact that day helped me out. I hit the jackpot. Pedro is also a hairdresser so he helped with my wig and getting it straight. Everything fell into place, that's for sure.  I'll keep you in mind for hanging out. I'll actually be back in LV the week of August 17th! My wife said she'll seriously consider going out with me while I'm dressed, if she can make it out there (I told her I didn't want to rush her and we could visit that topic in the coming weeks). We're taking baby steps right now, but eventually we might get to the point of hanging out in a group setting too."
crossdressing,39ejlt,vivchen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it!  I'm happy for you that your wife is becoming more and more accepting (and supportive, I hope) of this part of you.  I'm somewhat out to mine (married 13 years), but she's not quite at the point of going out with me while dressed yet.  Having a 9 year-old daughter also kind of complicates things a bit as well, but we make it work.  I'll be back in Vegas in early September for a week for a sporting event that I am working, but I have to be in guy-mode for the vast majority of my time there.  I am, however, trying to go a day or two earlier to eke out a little Hollie time before the event starts.    On another note, I have had the Sephora makeover done as well and it also came out amazingly.  Next time you're in Vegas, you may want to also try out a makeover at a BareMinerals boutique.  I had one done at their flagship location in San Francisco and it was also amazing.  Theirs is actually complimentary with no obligation to buy anything (I spent over $100 there anyway)."
crossdressing,39ejlt,_stiletto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"I understand how kids would make it difficult to get ready at home for a night out. We have 4 kids under the age of 9. That's another reason LV was the perfect place for me to start out. My wife understandably had a hard time with it at first. It's a lot to process and requires separating a few different ideas/thoughts that most people assume are one-in-the-same. It's difficult to hear ""wearing women's clothing"" and not jump to conclusions. At the end of the week, she realized this is just a little quirk of mine and it's not detrimental to our marriage. Also, that she loves me enough to work through it. I'd say on day 1 she was shocked and willing to be supportive without fully understanding. Day 2, 3, 4 were pretty intense and we were at risk of going our separate ways. We told a mutual friend (a lesbian married to another woman) and they were able to talk about it on day 5 while I traveled. I think that helped her out an incredible amount, and to put things into perspective. When I finally got home to her at the end of day 5, we made up. Today is only about day 9 and we're still getting better."
crossdressing,39ejlt,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy for you that things are getting more and more positive!  My wife was actually relieved when I first told her..........she was just glad I wasn't having an affair with another woman.  Of course, she had lots of general questions that I was more than relieved and happy to answer.  These days, she seems to let me have this as ""my thing,"" which is fine with me.  It seems to me that every girlfriend/spouse/SO approaches this differently.  At this point, I usually have to pick & choose & sometimes plan when I can dress, but I tend to find ways to make it happen."
crossdressing,39ejlt,Lucybat,2,Fri Jun 12 05:23:04 2015 UTC,"You kept it short, but I assume there was a lot more in the form of emotion and sentiment behind what you've said. I'm glad you have people you've confided in, and I'm glad you were able to go out on the town like that!"
crossdressing,39ejlt,natcrys,5,Thu Jun 11 06:49:07 2015 UTC,"I could seriously write a few pages about the week I just had. This is something I've been hiding for two decades and finally realized it shouldn't be that big of a deal. Even though I can't directly relate to Caitlyn Jenner, seeing her transition has been pretty inspiring and makes my own struggle seem small in comparison. I've read stories of other cross-dressers who regret waiting so long to tell their wives and have wasted a lot of years. I've also started watching the show Transparent. Ultimately it came down to not wanting to be 60 years old when I finally realize that I'm sick of keeping it a secret. I want to take what they've learned and apply it now while I'm 35."
crossdressing,39ejlt,thesunisthemoon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:56:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I confided early, and it was nice. Glad you were able to find people though, as crossdressing in secret does take its toll."

I very quickly came out to her best friend, who's been involved with CD and trans people for much longer than we both have. Yesterday I came out to my brother and sister.

Strangely enough, I haven't told a single one of my own family members. Most of them have proven to be very bigoted and I don't think they would benefit in any way from knowing. Or maybe they'd finally realize the error in their ways if someone close to them struggled with things they publicly criticize? I'll be thinking about that possibility."

They're kind of difficult to apply, but hopefully I did it right. I styled my wig differently and used a hairpin to style the bangs. Most importantly, I used an actual camera to take these pictures. I think this is an improvement over my last set, what do you all think? Any criticism welcome."

crossdressing,39cbep,Lyn724,5,Wed Jun 10 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"I know i'm not trans, at least not yet lol   What is this knowledge based on, your own introspection? Introspection can get things wrong. It is fallible. I once thought I ""knew"" I wasn't trans - after my divorce I have come to realize that I am trans. You seem to be leaning in that direction.    If i haven't made my point already- I like to identify with being more than just a crossdresser, but not transgender--maybe something in between.   One perspective is that crossdressing is already on the umbrella transgender spectrum. Crossdressing is one extreme end of the spectrum and transexualism (surgery, etc) is the other extreme. By being ""in between"" somewhere you are already farther along the transgender spectrum than your cut-and-dry CDing. There is nothing wrong with being in the middle of the spectrum, or a quarter of the way through or being anywhere. There is no one single way of being trans. There is not one way to transition. Everything comes in degrees. Your position on the spectrum can change overtime. Nothing is static.   Just saying. My 2 cents."

crossdressing,39cbep,AbbyCats,3,Thu Jun 11 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know the reason why I crossdress, it's a question I often get asked and ask myself. While I can give some kind of answer, an attraction to women and their clothes I'm never fully satisfied with my answer.  Since joining tumblr a lot of the people I chat to are trans girl and at times I feel that's just clouded my feelings even further. There have been times in my life when I hated the body I was given and even wished I had been born a girl. Still looking back I can't say I hated the fact I was male, more I just was wishing for a better situation to be in.  I can't say I'm even happy with my body today but I know that transitioning would not solve my hang ups. If anything it would probably just make things worse as I know I would not be the girl I'd actually really wanted to be.  I would just like to know really why I do dress, is there some end goal? I still feel like before long I'll just get up and quit. At the moment I'm single and the assumption at the back of mind is when I meet the right girl and settle down this will all just disappear but will it?  I lay in bed with thoughts like this whizing round for far too many sleepless hours :P"

For most of my life i've hated my body but i can't say i wish i was born a girl.  Looking for a goal or purpose to dress can be quite stressing too. There is a absolutely a sexual side to it for me, so sometimes i dress to entertain it's something i thoroughly enjoy and my dressing lets me express a side of me i don't feel like i can show otherwise. Then there are nights where i just have to dress, i don't know why, i just have to. You can try and explain it to people but its impossible because its just a feeling."
crossdressing,39cbep,CanadianCasualCD,3,Thu Jun 11 00:47:52 2015 UTC,"Hi Lyn, sorry to see you're still struggling with this but we'll help you through it. I'm also happy to hear you're having more success on the coming out front, so good for you. My reply will be a bit philosophical, so if you need clarification on something just pm me and I'd be happy to explain this stuff ad nauseam until you understand it.   Your questions seems to carry the language of purpose. What is the end of the thing that I'm doing? Why do I do it? These are questions that are goal oriented and force us to focus on the ends (or goals if you will) of actions. So the question: 'why do I eat,' is answered with, 'because it sustains my existence.' The trick is, 'purpose' in the western tradition carries with it the baggage of ends. In other words, when we speak of purpose, we want to know the why. We want to know what comes at the end of that action, and it's very difficult to get out of that little circle of language. It's like evil. Being a strong moral person is not choosing between good and evil actions, it is being able to identify which is the greater good between two good actions. The language of evil prevents us from seeing that actions are not merely black and white, but sometimes about choosing between nearly indistinguishable shades of light grey.   This language of purpose also suggests: actions are means to other ends. This is where we get the question: what is the meaning of life, because it is asking: what is the ultimate end? What is the end to which all ends lead to? But this isn't the only kind of action we do. There are actions, things that we do, which are ends in and of themselves. They are complete from moment to moment and are not simply means to other ends. So the question: why do I eat, its answer also allows us to achieve other ends. Maintaining my existence through sustenance allows me to achieve other ends, like answer this question for you. The purpose of eating is to achieve other ends. But some of my actions are not merely ends to other ends, they are complete in the doing of them. This is an old Aristotelian distinction. Seeing is the classic example. Seeing leads to no other ends. In seeing one might choose ends out there in the world that one sees, but the seeing itself is complete once I open my eyes to see. The end you fixate on when seeing is not an end achieved through seeing in the same way that eating helps you achieve other ends. I think crossdressing is this kind of thing, it is not always a means to other ends beyond itself, as it might be the case for those where crossdressing is a sexual activity, it can for some people be ends in and of themselves. There isn't something you lack that crossdressing fulfils other than a basic identity need. You aren't lacking anything for which the end of crossdressing fulfils. Crossdressing is complete when you engage in that activity.  The simple answer to your question: crossdressing might be for you it's own purpose. It is the end you seek and it is not to achieve any other end. You're not doing this to fulfil any lack or deficit. The pure and simple reason is:  it's a part of who you are and you want to do it. It is an end in and of itself. I get that this doesn't seem helpful because when you ask: why do I do a thing, and the answer is: because it is the end you seek; it doesn't have the same therapeutic response as a Freudian answer about the mind and why humans do what they do. But not being hung up by language and acknowledging this simple fact that there are two kinds of actions and they lead us to different kinds of ends can be helpful in moving away from things that lead us to non-answers. The fact that so many people are hung up on the question: why do I do this, should be a sign that maybe the question, or its language, trip us up and force us down a road we don't need to go.   I hope this was helpful. Again, if this sounds confusing you are welcome to ask me as many questions as you need in order to understand it."
crossdressing,39cbep,CanadianCasualCD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:56:52 2015 UTC,"That was a great post, and sensible analogy. That, I understand the most--doing something, because I like it, and its a part of who I am. End goal? I couldn't tell you. It hasn't even been a year yet so there's still plenty of time to figure this out. I do appreciate you taking your time to write this all out. It helps a lot."
crossdressing,39cbep,dazeyhazel11,2,Thu Jun 11 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"The beauty of it all is that you don't have to care about the end goal. If it is a means to another end then it will manifest itself on its own; if it is not, then you needn't worry about 'figuring it out,' because there is nothing to figure out. If it is done for its own sake then rejoice, you are who you are and no seeking of non-existent goals will change that. If it is to some other end, be patient, I'm sure it will become clear to you."
crossdressing,39cbep,Hollied,2,Thu Jun 11 19:40:34 2015 UTC,"I totally understand what you mean. I'd never identify as a girl, I don't mess around with pronouns or anything and certainly don't plan on being trans (not that I'm against any of that, obviously). Yet for some reason I still do this.  I don't know if it applies to you but for me, it's almost a split personality deal. I'm happy in both boy and girl mode, just in their own different ways. Guy-me likes different things to what Hazel likes and there's quite stark personality differences, yet I'd never say I'm unhappy as either. Crossdressing is just me indulging in and unlocking that second half of me.   Maybe your the same as me, who knows."
crossdressing,39cbep,ana07,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"This.  I'm not entirely sure if my personality is completely different between male me and Hollie, but the two are definitely different in many ways.  Pretty much everything else you describe fits me as well.  I don't think I would describe myself as full-on trans, but bi-gender seems to fit for me at this point."
crossdressing,39cbep,tinariddle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:33:44 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, and I don't think I'd ever want to be a woman for the rest of my life--i have no problem whatsoever with being male, it's just that the female style and activities seem a lot more fun and maybe meaningful, if that makes any sense. It's funny how quick I can change my attitude, like I could be talking about makeup with a female friend and then get super excited about Star Wars Battlefront the next second. Im still trying to figure this all out so, I don't know really, but I appreciate your two cents."
crossdressing,39cbep,tinariddle,2,Thu Jun 11 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that labels can be bad, especially with something like crossdressing which can definitely involve LGBT, but that doesn't mean everyone who does it is from a certain place in the sexuality spectrum - I would say just feel how you want to feel, and until you think you fit a certain label, or somewhere clear between two labels, be happy wherever you think you are :)  My answer is surprisingly simple, I love dressing mainly because of the huge variety in outfits women have, and how they look and feel so amazing. But it also really turns me on, and I like how it's meant to be forbidden or taboo. Whenever I know I have the house to myself I always get really excited about trying on my stepmom's clothes, since we have the exact same size in everything, and I love her style. But I've never considered transitioning and I am very comfortable as a straight young man as well as a woman. If I stopped getting the same excitement out of it, I'd be happy to stop. Overall I'm just taking it as it goes and not really thinking about the long-term :)"
crossdressing,39cbep,letterstosnapdragon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:30:02 2015 UTC,"Most of us, especially when we're young, are trying to figure out what things are and where they go, and labels are useful until we don't need them anymore. Once I discovered the term crossdresser, and the amount of people that were doing it, I felt a freedom, and that I wasn't a freak. Now I don't need that label, though I use it sometimes to find subreddits like this. :)  Labels are good for now, to help you understand where you're going. People outgrow labels, and your pursuit of figuring out yourself and who you are is going to be a long and arduous journey. The anxieties you feel now are felt by many of us too. I hate it when I go out with my male friends and female friends I haven't come out to yet because when we pass by a mall or a store, I can't just go to the women's section and start browsing it, and even walking out with a bag or two of my own.   So I figured I would hang out with like minded people, and confide in people I trusted. You might want to consider hanging out with gender fluid people, with trans people, and even those that identify as bigender. I sometimes like to identify as bigender, but sometimes that label doesn't fit either.   Good luck, we're all here for you!"

Personally I like creative games so City Skylines is one I've been playing recently. I also like a good open world sandbox type games, like those from Bethesda.

Mods really helped to keep games fresh when I was kid with no money. These days I can throw cash at anything and while it's great I can own whatever I want, it spoils it too because I don't get invested in games like I used. Still that might also have something to do with not having the time these days to play anything. I've got a load of games on steam I've yet to even load up for the first time :(  I enjoyed Minecaft, again loved the creativity involved especially when you throw the mobs in for random lols, but had to give up on it again as it ate up just too much time."

Some of my favorites are Dark Souls, Witcher, Mass Effect, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Bioshock, etc. I thought about this for a while and I think that younger people are less interested in preserving classic gender stereotypes then previous generations. A long time ago, 20 year old boys were expected to be good at fixing cars, sports, able to do lots of physical labor, etc. Some even wanted to go into the military and be as tough as they could possibly be. But with the increase in computers, young men tend to not want to go out and do blue collar work as much as previous generations did.  I think computers and video games made today's men less manly. I know a lot of my friends that play video games don't fit 1950s stereotypes of manliness. Similarly, I can't imagine a plumber, mechanic, security guard, or construction worker sitting around at home playing Final Fantasy, WoW, or any other sort of video game.  In conclusion, maybe video games are making today's boys ""soft"", and the softening process makes boys more interested in things like crossdressing rather than hunting and working out at the gym."

As for games that include crossdressing, Persona 4 (also my favourite game of all time by far) is the best example I can think of, with the crossdressing pageant at the high school with you, Yosuke, Kanji and Teddie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy9C0qooyp0). I thought it was treated quite well, especially when Teddie makes his appearance!"

I'm into video games too, but I'm a bit older, so more into retro stuff. I can't hack FPS anymore due to crazy bad motion sickness, but I still enjoy a lot of games. Played my PS2 to death twice, and got a PS3 very recently so I'm enjoying the large library and inexpensive games."

crossdressing,39b9ga,Ihliana,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:33:42 2015 UTC,Well the internet attracts people who enjoy using computers/internet/technology in general. It's not hard to see why most people on the internet would enjoy a game now and then. Personally I would be playing league of legends or monster Hunter right about now but don't have a way to connect those things to the internet right now. :/

crossdressing,39bfte,tinariddle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:39:40 2015 UTC,"Yah, if your in Canada, easiest way to get heels for your self. Just pick a time like during school hours on a week day if you can and then it's slow, and usually if it's slow there's only 1 person at the cash so they have to stay there, and if they're in a pair and its slow... They sit and chat. My experience, it's best if you can just go try them on. I fit 4 different sizes so you almost have to, but when you find the brand you like, it's easy from there."

Although the 11 gets a little big at time. Also, don't forget that your feet are not exactly the same. One is most likely larger than the other, so use that as a guide and use gel padding for your smaller foot. I would estimate my difference is somewhere around a 1/4 size."

Told them I like wearing women's clothes and didn't want to do it in private any more (cause it was annoying having to change before leaving my room or wait for a weekend where they were both out). They said it was cool. I told them if it made them uncomfortable at any point, they just have to let me know. Granted these friends of mine are women so, it may have been easier.  Although really, my male friends that know do not care at all. My female friends make a big deal out of it. Not in a bad way, but in a supportive ""yeah you do what you want"" and ""you're one of the girls now."" While my male friends don't even acknowledge it. I got one comment from a male friend a few weeks ago while I was wearing short shorts and a tank top on a very warm day; the comment was along the lines of ""With this temperature, I wish I had the balls to wear something like that.""  The responses from my male friends when I first told them were along the lines of ""Okay"" or ""Whatever. As long as it doesn't get weird."""

Makes finding a reason to wear it a bit harder, but when I find clothing in good condition that fits me, I'm not going to be too picky in what I buy.  The uneven hem doesn't really bug me too much; most of the times the short parts are too short though. In this case, it worked out nicely.

crossdressing,392dtu,Sophia_White,4,Mon Jun 8 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"So, I have been crossdressing secretly since the age of about 12. I'm now 22 and have moved to a new city. I'm still dressing in secret, but last week I went out for drinks with an old work colleague. We got pretty drunk and loose lipped, he's gay so I reasoned if anyone would accept this side of me then he would and so I came right out with it and told him that I am a crossdresser. He was so supportive, and I showed him the pictures on my Flickr page and he said I was a really cute girl and that I am welcome to go out with him and his boyfriend any time, to a club in London and they will look out for me and make sure I am comfortable! I literally couldn't be happier with how it went - I know it's only a baby step but it was a huge thing for me to tell someone who wasn't anonymous through the internet - so onwards and upwards! To celebrate, here's a couple of photos of me in a new super cute tartan dress (sorry for the selfies!)  TL;DR - I told my gay friend I am a crossdresser and he said I'm cute and he'd love to take me clubbing."

Good luck with the liquid eyeliner, I've yet to try any out but I hear it's a nightmare!  I would also suggest giving contouring a go, bit of bronzer under the cheekbone and highlighter on top would really make your cheeks stand out.

crossdressing,3915no,CDStacy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"Coconut oil does wonders.  Here's an article I read recently about some beauty uses for coconut oil.........makeup remover is #5 on this list:  http://www.prevention.com/beauty/coconut-oil-cures-your-skin-and-hair  Besides makeup remover wipes, soaps, and exfoliating scrubs, coconut oil not only does the job, It's good for your skin in general."
crossdressing,3915no,Hollied,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"Wipes get most of it off, but I personally use an Almay oil based eye makeup  removal with q tips. Q tips get right next to your eye, making it easier to remove it without scrubbing. Lipstick usually comes off easily with soap.  You also might want to consider moisturizer, because you might be putting on too much makeup. Makeup goes on easier after moisturizer, and you might have too much oil from the wipes and soap, and not your own.  You can even just use neutrogena face wash made for men, as our face and oil composition might differ.  If you're scrubbing your face, you might also be damaging  your skin. So moisturize, and hopefully the makeup goes on light enough that you can remove it without scrubbing."

I'll use warm water and a soft cloth to remove the top layer, then smear the cold cream over my damp face, rubbing in circles with my fingers.  Then, another swipe with my warm damp soft cloth.  Sometimes I'll need a wipe to do the final clean, or a q-tip with eye makeup remover to finish the eyes.  If I wore makeup every day, I might try some of the other products, but this works great for my occasional makeup days."

crossdressing,38ykb7,CantThinkOfAName62,2,Sun Jun 7 23:00:22 2015 UTC,"What color tops do you have?  If you have a navy top, you can do pretty much light color skirt, but I would recommend white or tan to make the colors contrast."
crossdressing,38ykb7,Hollied,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:33:08 2015 UTC,Normally I would say the matching should go the other way around.  I know that's not always easy because us girls normally have a very limited wardrobe.  I'd pick the skirt and top first and then select a colour of tights to match because the tights are more of an accessory.
crossdressing,38ykb7,TheWizardKara,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"White is definitely an option, however, black is a very universal color. I personally would say just get black to have something that goes with all the tights, then experiment with colors. You can even google certain fashion styles to see how they look together.   I personally get tights just based on what I'm wearing on top and what skirt/shorts I'm wearing. You might want to consider that as well.   A nice look would be a black top with white polka dots, a black skirt and navy blue tights, maybe some black heels or black suede lace up wedges. That's what I'm imagining in my head. You can definitely go ham with anything else that might be available to you."

crossdressing,38wvyu,tinariddle,2,Sun Jun 7 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like wearing tights, but they're necessary for me, as I have been incognito/rarely take care of my legs. I am doing better now, especially my face. But I learned why girls take so long. They deliberately take their time, as so not to rip or tear anything. Once I began being more graceful and feminine in my acts of things like makeup and putting on clothing, I found myself tearing less and actually reveling in the experience as well.

For pantyhose, I now only get a couple certain brands/styles that end up lasting me quite a long time............Spanx & Hanes Smooth Illusions are my go-tos.  Yes, they are a bit more expensive, but I have only had to replace them once or twice in the past year.  The thicker tights I've bought at Target have lasted about a year......and counting."

crossdressing,38wvyu,tinariddle,3,Tue Jun 9 10:45:17 2015 UTC,"I recently broke up with my SO after a very long relationship, and honestly, I'm very on the fence about it. On one hand, I'm ready and willing to move on, but I know I have to be respectful of the fact that we just got out of the relationship. Not saying that it doesn't hurt, just saying that it was a long time coming, and things didn't end well. I wanted to end on a sweeter note, but I guess things didn't go as planned.  So now I'm in a rather strange state where I'm definitely free to shave my legs and whatnot, however, I don't have the urge to just because I'm still upset and don't want to move on too quickly, because I'm afraid that's disrespectful and wouldn't honor the good times we did have. I'm riding an emotional rollercoaster, and being at work doesn't help....  Edit: I guess the anxieties come from the fact that we've had patterns like this, but she would usually call me, or I would call her and we would find our way back to each other. This just somehow felt final, especially since she's moving back home, which is a couple states over. I just want to crawl under a rock, or go out and make a fool of myself. Either way, I don't want her to call me in either of those states, though being under a rock would make more sense than being out and trying to drown my sorrows..."
crossdressing,38wvyu,cd_account,3,Mon Jun 8 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"I went through similar with my divorce, but ultimately came to the conclusion that if dressing killed my marriage (which it did but not solely) then I was damn well doing it do if it I wanted to now that I had the opportunity.   I get the whole worrying about being disrespectful thing; I had similar thoughts although in my case it was helped by the behaviour of my ex shortly after we broke up. Give it time and see how you feel.   I haven't been on this sub long but this seems like a friendly community. I'm sure you'll get lots of support :)"
crossdressing,38wvyu,AbbyCats,2,Mon Jun 8 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear about your break-up especially that is didn't end well.  I understand not wanting to dress because you feel it would be disrespectful. If you're anything like me then even if you have all the time in the world to yourself, you can still not dress if you're not in the right frame of mind. Dressing for me while a lot of fun is not necessarily relaxing and I've found really mess me up if I'm not right in the head.  Hope you start to feel better soon, big hugs and take care :)"
crossdressing,38wvyu,Hollied,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your breakup.  We're here for you.  As for your current thoughts on dressing, the best thing IMO is to be true to yourself.  I understand your feelings about wanting to be respectful, but that goes both ways.  I know this hurts, but now you both have time to re-assess yourselves and figure out where to go from here.  For you, if that involves going on hiatus from dressing, OK.  If that involves dressing more and exploring more of this side of you, great!  Wherever things go, be true to yourself and embrace this new beginning.  Warm hugs :)"
crossdressing,38wvyu,dazeyhazel11,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"I had deleted my Reddit profile and purged most of my stuff a couple months ago after being active for almost a year. I guess I wasn't feeling satisfied with my dressing.  After two months, I feel like I want to get back to it, still not knowing what I want to get out of it.   Hopefully this time I stick around and figure something out. Having to get all new stuff sucks though.

In case you feel like purging again, just remember that dressing up is a hobby in a way, and as with most hobbies you will go through phases where you just don't feel it anymore. If you throw your stuff out because of that then you'll be kicking yourself when you come out of that phase like I'm sure you are now. x"

crossdressing,38wvyu,LastArg,3,Tue Jun 9 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"I went through this cycle all through middle school and high school (started early). Once I found people did support me, and I wasn't a ""freak,"" (though most crossdressers still get a bad rap from people who troll craigslist) I was able to accept that crossdressing happens when I least expect it, and when I feel feminine. It's hard to explain, but so is love, and that's rather universal. I say do what feels comfortable. Guilt and shame come and go, but I'm sure that we;ve all felt it. Just keep in mind that you aren't alone, and that those clothes were expensive!  At least donate them! (jk, but seriously, try to hold on to them, just in case.)"
crossdressing,38wvyu,lithiummethoxide,2,Thu Jun 11 07:24:08 2015 UTC,"It's easy to go through times when you get down on yourself and want to find an aspect of your life that may be to blame for the sad or unsatisfied feelings. That's what happened to me for many years, and I would go through a big purge and vow to forget about dressing forever.  But I had to realize that is only repressing it. Now I have the attitude that the purging impulse will pass, and so far it has helped a lot just adjusting my viewpoint like that."
crossdressing,38wvyu,dazeyhazel11,2,Tue Jun 9 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"So I don't do full cross dress, but after wearing a pair of Miel Sisters boy shorts in rocky horror I realized I really liked wearing panties. Best brands/styles for men? I'm not packing and wear a women's large pretty well in the two pair (boy shorts both) I own, and just bought some more in similar styles to see what else feels good. So...suggestions?  EDIT: got my styles wrong. They're hipsters, not boyshorts."
crossdressing,38wvyu,LastArg,3,Wed Jun 10 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"I really like Pink brand panties from Victoria's Secret. Regarding the best style? Personally I just try to stay away from any seam going down the direct middle of the crotch fabric. I have found it makes it very uncomfortable throughout the day and nothing stays in place; i constantly have to readjust and stopped buying them. The ones I prefer are ""cheekster"" right now. Not the cheapest but they are pretty well made."

crossdressing,38wvyu,natcrys,2,Wed Jun 10 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has been the lack of sleep (I work from midnight to 8am, so getting sleep during the day is difficult), or if it has been a lot of personal stuff in my life, but there's a little thing that's been bothering me.  The use of the word ""hon,"" or ""dear"" are really starting to rub me the wrong way. When certain crossdressers use it to feel feminine, sure, I get it, but it's something a grandmother would say, or someone who was trying to passive-aggressively comment on something.   ""That looks cute hon!""  ""Thanks, hon!"" ""Where is that, hun?"" It just makes me feel like you're trying to be an old endearing grandmother, or trying too hard to be that one aunt that likes to dress young.  I don't know if I'm just angry for no reason, or my female persona still feels young. Or maybe I actually think my female persona basically my male persona, but dressed differently with minor mannerism changes, and that the extra add on words are unnecessary. Is this just me? Am I going to piss off the cattier crossdressers (just kidding, but seriously, I've ran into a few, but not on here)."
crossdressing,38wvyu,AbbyCats,3,Thu Jun 11 07:34:30 2015 UTC,"While 'hon' and 'dear' have been around for quite sometime I think they're still relevant. While I have to admit day-to-day I don't hear them very often my female friends will often use them in texts or other messages.  I am, however, in my mid-thirties so perhaps I am deemed to be 'old' these days :P  Just quickly touching on your point about about feeling more feminine it's not a feeling I have, even when crossdressing. Although I would say I don't feel more masculine the rest of the time either.

I get what you mean, there shouldn't be a distinction in the first place, as they are just words, but I just felt people used it in some female persona (with pink text, might I add) and it just bugged me. That's just me though. I would rather not label things, but I find it easier than having to explain sometimes. Hahah."
crossdressing,38wvyu,tinariddle,2,Fri Jun 12 10:38:49 2015 UTC,"I do understand what you mean (especially about the pink!) that's why I added the bit about femininity and masculinity. I don't feel I have a masculine or feminine persona, so when I see someone write '... I feel so girly', it makes me feel funny. Lets throw away these labels haha."
crossdressing,38wvyu,tinariddle,3,Fri Jun 12 11:01:41 2015 UTC,I use it all the time with my friends (IRL and on the internet)... just like I use 'dude' and 'mate' for my guy friends.

Of all the idiosyncratic things people do online, it ranks pretty low on my list of pet peeves.  That said, I know this particular behavior drives some people crazy for whatever reason.

I might try something more casual to see how it works out. It sort of feels like cheating to only do maid dresses hehe.
crossdressing,38wvyu,PantyMan77,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"It's up to you how far you want to go with your crossdressing. Just do what feels right. Technically I am right now by wearing work shoes from Forever 21 and knee-high nylons at work even though I'm also wearing a polo and khakis. Speaking for myself, I personally think that in order to ""crossdress"" one doesn't have to go completely to the other side. I believe it is more of a desire to look femme and to remove any masculinity. While I am not exactly a masculine person I don't overly try to hide it as that is not my intention. I am not trying to be a ""trap""."

crossdressing,38vchw,PetraB,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:53:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone uses a little editing sometimes to clean up things. 99.9% of my photos are the real me. And I don't use Adobe. I use a combination of BeautyPlus and YouCam Perfect edit.   I don't have someone to take photos on my phone or take photos of me. I use my old digital camera for my full body shots. And since it's old. I do the best with what I have.  It's a lot of work going through and picking the best shots out of a ton of photos and then spend hours cleaning them up and getting them to look right. And because I'm not 100 percent open about my trans life, I have to be on the constant lookout when I take these. I don't have all day to get the lighting and scenery just right.  We risk a lot getting out there and displaying our femininity. You should know that by now. Guess I can't please everyone."
crossdressing,38vchw,PetraB,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:34:14 2015 UTC,"I was being serious saying you look nice. But you shouldn't feel you need to edit the pictures. If you want to, fine.   And ill let you in on a secret, if anyone you know sees your pictures here they have just as much explaining to do as you."
crossdressing,38vchw,littlemissfuzzy,2,Sun Jun 7 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"I don't edit out of any insecurity. I do so because of my location and where I shoot them. Plus I don't mind cleaning up some of the rough edges. I'm very picky about the presentation, and I'd like them to look great !  Like I said 99.9 percent of my photos are the real deal. A lot of us do some sort of editing.   The location I use (in front of my neighborhood) is probably the most secure one I have right now. It's a rather quiet hood and I like my privacy, but there are those time where there are neighbors out and traffic goes by of people that I know who doesn't know about this yet. So my shoots have to be kind of guerilla photography sometimes, so I don't have time to get everything right sometimes.   I have a digital camera that is 11 years old. My iphone is better, yes. But I don't have some one to take photos for me or else I would use it much more. The digital camera is fine until the sun goes behind my building. My problem last night was then the shadow started forming in front of my place, I forgot to turn on the flash. And the editing is mainly used to brighten it up cause the originals are way too dark.  My apologies if I came off as hostile earlier. and I thank you for the kind words regardless."

crossdressing,38vero,LightSpectrum,2,Sun Jun 7 03:57:54 2015 UTC,There are some very good videos on Youtube of how to do your makeup as a CD.  As far as heels are concerned look around at CIS women and look at what heels they were in a majority of cases they are not the type of heels that many CD's seem to end up buying.   A lot of shoes carry larger sizes if that is an issue.  As you can order on line from some stores and even collect in stores.  Clothing again look at what CIS girls are wearing what is best if you can is go for more classic pieces that way they rarely go out of fashion and are great to mix and match.  A lot of stores do mail order or order on line and collection in store.   This allows you to return things that don't fit or just don't work.  Depending on your height their are specialist women's stores like Long Tall Sally if you are tall.
crossdressing,38vero,Sarahjan,2,Sun Jun 7 08:14:49 2015 UTC,"Shoes: I have a few pairs of vans and chucks that would work, but half of the fun here is heels is it not? If I were to buy one pair to go a few different looks what would they be?   Black pumps. Closed toe. Platform. 4-6"" range. Suede if you can manage. They'll go with almost anything a beige/nude pair of heels won't. If you want to mix in more color, we can keep talking."
crossdressing,38vero,_stiletto,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:39:49 2015 UTC,"I seem to be having a hell of a time finding suede, and I definitely agree they look a lot better!"
crossdressing,38vero,dazeyhazel11,2,Sun Jun 7 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"For a wig, especially when you are just starting out, I'd just keep it cheap and look around sites like amazon, keeping an eye on reviews. If you look hard enough you can find some decent looking stuff without spending a lot of money, it's where I got mine! Hair colour is something you might experiment with but for now I'd just either stick with your natural hair colour or pick the colour you'd like to have ideally. You can always change it later (which is the beauty of this!).  For makeup I would again just stick with sites like amazon (infact for pretty much everything, honestly :P) and the basics you need are lipstick, an eyeliner pen, mascara, foundation (liquid is the easiest in my opinion) and an eyeshadow pallet of some kind. Blush  and contouring stuff, powder etc are all great to have but in reality you don't need it when you're starting out so it's better if you just learn the basics first; you'll stress yourself out otherwise.   If you'd like to talk more I'd love to give you a hand in picking out makeup and clothes with you, and being a mentor for a while. Just drop me a pm and feel free to check out my blog (linked in my flair) and my other posts here for inspiration and a few tutorials :)"
crossdressing,38vero,dazeyhazel11,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"The part you wrote about makeup, is ~exactly~ what I was looking for!!!! I tried searching for like a starter kit, but they all had 500 colors and 30 brushes.  Lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, foundation, got it! Do I need something to apply the foundation with or does it come 'included' like with the other items?"
crossdressing,38vero,tinariddle,2,Sun Jun 7 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"Lipstick, eyeliner and mascara are all tools in themselves, mascara comes on it's own brush, eyeliner normally in the form of a pen or a pencil (maybe also a brush if it's reeeaaally fancy) and lipstick is pretty obvious. Foundation doesn't need a tool either, normally you just dot it around your face and rub it in until it looks even, I suppose there are some types which may need extra tools but don't worry about that at all for now :)  I'd be careful with foundation though, it's difficult to find the right shade. my first bottle of foundation was the wrong shade and looked a lot like I was wearing fake tan. Unless you go to a store and test it, I'd recommend just buying cheap stuff online for a couple dollars until you really know what shade you are.   Now, eyeshadow is normally better with brushes when you start getting better at it, but it really is quite an art and I normally go without anyway because it's so fiddely. A lot of girls I know just apply it with their fingers anyway so I wouldn't worry about any brushes for now honestly."

My suggestion for a clean shave is using a normal, not electric razor, and to shave slowly, the length of an inch or two at a time, so that you thoroughly get the hairs instead of roughly getting them, and then they're too short to trim further."

crossdressing,38pmgp,DunmerPrincess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:42:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think that modern society prohibits men from wearing dresses, it's just that it is seen as weird, unnatural, and freaky to wear dresses if you're a man. Society looks down upon people like us, who for whatever our reasons, like to wear clothing that society deems fit for only one gender. Wearing dresses is comfortable, I really like wearing them although I feel uncomfortable if, on the very rare occasion, I leave the house wearing one. Clothes are just clothes and even though some items of clothes look better on certain genders people should not be made to feel uncomfortable wearing anything they want.

crossdressing,38p9u3,cee_zed,2,Fri Jun 5 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"We all think we're secretive about these things, but we are surprisingly obvious to the people around us. Just think about how many parents know their child is gay before they come out. You think they weren't being secretive about their sexuality? It's the little things. Of course being caught or finding strange clothes are a give away, but little things like traces of make-up, sudden focus on the way your clothes sit and sometimes even just the way your clothes sit (depending on what you wear beneath) can be tells. These things may not seem like much but they've known you your whole life. Ever wonder why parents seem to be psychic with their ability to just know when something is up? That's what watching someone live for many years will give you: a keen ability to tell how they behave in certain scenarios. They probably knew something was up the moment you started getting all secretive. They may not have known what exactly it was, but they probably noticed your change in behaviour. He probably has some idea that this is going on, even if he doesn't have proof."
crossdressing,38p9u3,CanadianCasualCD,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:39:31 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I know what you mean.. I have no idea though. Im still planning to come out to him someday though. Maybe it's just time to do it sooner than later.
crossdressing,38p9u3,cee_zed,2,Sat Jun 6 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking these things don't get easier with time. In many cases the worrying makes it harder on you so you're really only doing yourself a disservice. But you should do it when you're ready. He's always going to be your father, don't let this create a divide between you when you can do something about it. I know what it's like to have a troubled relationship with a father (and it's not about crossdressing either). It's not pleasant. I hope you tell him someday, and I hope he understands and accepts you for who you are. And if not, give it time. You might be surprised who gifts you a dress for your birthday. Best of luck to you."
crossdressing,38p9u3,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:37:00 2015 UTC,Not so sure it's like that. Parents don't have magic powers.  We know what we're hiding the rest of the world does not.  People can be oblivious or interpreting in a very different way.
crossdressing,38p9u3,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:39:23 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I said it 'seems' that way. Of course they don't have magical powers to just divine what is happening in your life. But they've watched you your whole life. They've seen you when you're happy, and when you're sad. They know how you act when you feel contempt and disgust. They know how you respond to certain stimuli. They know when you're secretly bothered and pretending to be upset. Hell, my mom knew when I got bullied a bit that day. They've seen you and watched how you've acted for years, decades even. It's not a magical power, it's just what happens when you watch someone grow up for that length of time. So yes, only you only ever know what is happening in your life, and yes, they can be mistaken. But I highly doubt that someone who's watched you for 20 years (or whatever) doesn't know when you're hiding something, or suddenly start acting differently. No, they might not immediately assume you're crossdressing or whatever, but they know you. They know you, in some ways, better than you know yourself. Because they've seen how you act and respond to all kinds of stimuli, and we behave in predictable ways. I doubt his father knows everything, but I do think he has clued in that something has been happening."

crossdressing,38kys7,justalittlequeer,3,Thu Jun 4 22:00:08 2015 UTC,"Constructive criticism: you probably should learn how to smile better. It's actually a very minor problem, since most of your photos look fine without it: only 7 stands out, because that pose you're trying to do looks a bit weird with a straight face. Doing at least the smile of 9 would help.  That tiny detail at that one photo is pretty much the only real flaw I can find, so yeah, you're amazing."
crossdressing,38kys7,DR6,2,Fri Jun 5 19:35:57 2015 UTC,I actually did a double take. You pass amazingly well

crossdressing,38i3ph,MyWeekendShoes,2,Thu Jun 4 11:38:56 2015 UTC,What kind of camera do you use? Your photos always turn out really nice.
crossdressing,38i3ph,MyWeekendShoes,2,Thu Jun 4 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"I use a Panasonic Luminx FS35, its a bit dated now but still a decent snap shot camera.  However, colours will look a little washed out if you don't take photos in natural light or with additional light sources, the flash can also washout colours too. Longer shots, and I'm only taking a few feet away look a little blurry but could well be down to my poor lighting and not being able to focus properly as I have to set-up the shot without me in the picture.  So it can be awkward but I've still been able to take some decent photos.  I would highly recommend everyone buy a cheap tripod too, really helps take long shots, they look so much better than those taken in a mirror.  These photos here are also helped by me adding some filter effects, I don't usually use filters though. Really happy to hear you like my photos though Chelsey, yours come out great too :)"
crossdressing,38i3ph,Iakel,2,Thu Jun 4 11:38:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips- that's really helpful. Think I'm about ready to upgrade from taking pictures on my phone.

crossdressing,38lr7q,bsb2001ca,2,Fri Jun 5 01:11:24 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I feel like I am more gender fluid or even bigender. Its not just crossdressing I like. I enjoy looking at dresses and just girly things in general. It's hard to say really.
crossdressing,38lr7q,Lyn724,2,Fri Jun 5 02:55:53 2015 UTC,I know exactly how you feel having my girlfriend told me the same thing. I still shop at victoria's secret and I still go out crossdressed and I even do so with her present. She does not mind it but at the same time I feel bad that I can only take it so far with her.
crossdressing,38lr7q,CielIvy,2,Fri Jun 5 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"We do girly things all the time, sometimes she's even excited to go out do my make up and go for a stroll. She likes the easy access that a skirt gives her. She just doesn't want me to get my own real boobs is all."
crossdressing,38lr7q,TheWizardKara,2,Fri Jun 5 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"i personally hate the word crossdresser, it's a label and is inaccurate for my own situation.  I'm not transexual because I have no desire to get surgery, I'm not a crossdresser because that implies it's taking clothes and just wearing them.  I feel that I have a female part to my personality, same way I have a sense of humour, an interest in cars, a love of adventure sports and a kinky taste in sex. Just cos I like kinky sex doesn't mean I want to be a 24/7 sex slave, or that I will change my career to build a car. they are all aspects of what makes me the person I am. When I slip into a female persona, or more likely those traits come out stronger I will wear the clothes that feel comfortable and right; those happen to be heels and skirts. I don't see them as girls clothes, I just see them as my clothes.  My gf knows all about it and she says it's just part of who I am, it's not a kink, or a fetish, it's just another varied part of me.   hmmm i hope that makes some sense."
crossdressing,38lr7q,TheWizardKara,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:13:22 2015 UTC,You can't hate a word just because it doesn't describe you perfectly. There are plenty of people who do fall into that category otherwise there wouldn't be a subreddit for it.
crossdressing,38lr7q,DunmerPrincess,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:46:42 2015 UTC,"it's just a personal thing, that's all. if you hear it in general conversation it is usually associated with non flattering imagery to everyone. to others i may fit the description, but i personally don't use it to describe myself.  each to their own!"
crossdressing,38lr7q,BepperNZ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:03:16 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying -- I feel like ""crossdresser"" kinda implies it's JUST about the clothes. Like a guy who has, say, a purely sexual fetish for women's underwear and that's it. That doesn't describe me accurately and I don't think it does for most people on this sub -- it's true that clothes are a big part of it but for me anyway they are a means to an end, which is sometimes wanting to completely inhabit a feminine persona and presentation as much as possible. I agree that ""crossdresser"" doesn't seem to intuitively capture all of that."
crossdressing,38lr7q,carrie001,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, everyone to their own,  You have to be comfortable with what you do, just as your girlfriend needs to be equally comfortable.  You need to temper your desires to suit you both of you if you want your relationship to endure."
crossdressing,38lq3j,Jodythejujitsuguy,2,Fri Jun 5 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"I personally would get a seamstress involved, unless you trust yourself with scissors. What you can do is cut the fabric that makes up the shelf. Try cutting along the inner side of the top, and make sure to be careful. You might end up snipping the actual cami. Don't cut on the seam, cut before the seam, towards the shelf fabric. Good luck!   If you still need help, I'll show you what lining I'm talking about. I have a cami with a shelf bra."

crossdressing,38hylg,jesstouchme23,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:50:28 2015 UTC,"Your makeup is coming along well! I would suggest for your lower eyelid to either get closer to your eye, or if you can't, make it a bit lighter. Try going halfway instead maybe?   As for your foundation, sometimes it's harder to see with cameras that don't shoot at a higher quality, but it looks fine. Maybe try something a bit redder, it looks a bit yellow in the shot. It just might be the computer lighting though, who knows?"
crossdressing,38hylg,tinariddle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:33:32 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestions! I will definitely try getting the lower eyelid closer to my eye! Thank you!
crossdressing,38hylg,dazeyhazel11,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Looking good, my advice is to just try taking pictures with the camera looking down on you, rather than you looking down on the camera. The difference it will make in lighting and just general cuteness is insane sometimes. There's probably some psychology in there about this how making yourself look smaller gives you a more femme look but who knows :)"

crossdressing,38dufs,SirEnder1,3,Wed Jun 3 20:34:42 2015 UTC,you're VERY pretty. so lucky too! it sounds like you've got a great support group around you!
crossdressing,38dufs,dazeyhazel11,2,Thu Jun 4 08:48:22 2015 UTC,"Really amazing stuff, my only real advice for you is to experiment and try new things! You're doing this to have fun so play around with poses, expressions and camera angles to see what you can create.  Sticking on the theme of experimenting, why not try some new hair styles. Your wig looks super well-kept (so jealous here) so why not try ponytails or my personal favourite half-up-half-down. Essentially that's made like a ponytail but, but run your fingers through the centre of your hair, collecting half of it and leaving half behind before making your ponytail. It'll give your front-side a whole new thinner look and give people behind you something to look it while admiring you :)"

crossdressing,38id5a,gothy_princess,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:25:52 2015 UTC,To me it seems like black items with sleeves help to downplay shoulders.  Posture is also big here - keeping the shoulders back.
crossdressing,38id5a,urRoommateKyogre,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"This is my eternal problem!  I can't buy a lot of things with sleeves because it's very hard to find women's clothes that will fit across my shoulders.  Most dresses, jackets, etc are impossible for me to wear because I can't put my arms into the sleeves without ripping the fabric across the back.  I've had some luck with strapless gowns and very stretchy bodysuits.  Of course, if your question is how to hide wide shoulders, my answer would be big hair (Ha!) and finding the right pose for any pics because any full-on shot will show big shoulders no matter what you do."
crossdressing,38id5a,sandyd2001,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"There's this guide from /r/femalefashionadvice:  http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/21bn2i/on_dressing_your_body_type/  It has lots of useful tips, it's worth reading entirely. In particular for shoulders it says:   To give them less focus: raglan sleeves, dolman sleeves, deep sccop/V necks. Also, try emphasizing your hips."
crossdressing,38id5a,oox8ue0G,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:46:36 2015 UTC,"Some really good advice on here, thank you!"
crossdressing,38id5a,tinariddle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Wide shoulders are the worst. I cope with it by always covering them with something a bit loose, but feminine. Cardigans and Bolero jackets are your best friends. 3/4 sleeves are cute too, and if you're daring, off one shoulder is bold, but may work. Avoid scoop necks, double off the shoulder sleeves, and anything else that might draw attention to them, like lace sleeves. If you want to go sleeveless, try spaghetti straps with a high cutoff towards the top, and avoid wide straps, as they also make them look broader. Good luck!"

People don't realize it, but sometimes, when I don't have what I need to complete an outfit, I go into my male wardrobe. I used my white shirt by unbuttoning and tying up the bottoms to make a cute top to go with a cardigan and skirt, or used my Chuck Taylors to complete a casual skater girl outfit, and I've even used some of my ties for some punky looks. You just gotta use what you have sometimes."

crossdressing,38f07e,Jallin92,3,Wed Jun 3 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"my advice is dress appropriate for the location. We all want to dress in the most amazing outfits, but that's not always a good idea if you want to blend in.  If you're going shopping on a saturday afternoon you don't want all the glamorous bling that is more suited to a friday night in a club. it's tough to do, but a normal outing means normal clothes. the goal is to try to look great without it looking like you're trying too hard. look at what the girls wear in that setting and try to blend in   oh, and have fun!!!!"

crossdressing,38f07e,Alisonchainz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:21:23 2015 UTC,What specifically do you need advice about?  The hardest part is just going out the first time.

crossdressing,38f07e,MajaRyan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"Go to a big area with lots of people.  You will be feelings all kinds of feelings, everyone will barely notice you.  Find queer friendly spaces to start.  The worst people will do is ignore you.  If you are a drinker, I'd recommend a little bit of liquid courage.  Helps loosen you up and let the girl out."

She use to clean my room cause it bothered her and she found some of my sisters girly clothing she didn't wear and tried to convince my dad that this was the case. Honestly I don't think you can rely on us. If you have a gf or sibling who knows your dad, ask them. But in my opinion, if you think he'll accept it, and it's already leaking out and your friends are cool, then you should do it sooner than later. Send the email and see what he says. I feel like worse case scenario, you have to hide it at home and once your off to class, you'll be able to dress freely there and leave the dorm? Dressed when you want."
crossdressing,38fkdf,bsb2001ca,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:51:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately, it's just my dad and I. I'm an only child too lol."
crossdressing,38fkdf,oox8ue0G,2,Thu Jun 4 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"I've said elsewhere that I'm not a fan of just sending emails, you don't know in what context they'll be received and you're not there to ask questions. It is however a good idea to write the email and make sure it says exactly what you mean and anticipate the questions you'll get, don't wing it. After you've written it, print it out and do it personally, either reading it aloud or handing it over at an appropriate moment when you know they have time and aren't in a rush. Over the phone might work, though the lack of physical presence makes it different.  Then again, I've never done it myself so all the above may be just the ramblings of an idiot. There's something to be said for not making it sound like the world's going to end. Keep it light, you're not doing anything wrong. Hopefully other people here also have good advice.  Good luck in any case!"

They're both loving, even if they don't get why I am this way. I did it through email. Now, I'm sure my circumstances are different than yours, but I encourage you to at least write down what you need to say to your father. You don't have to send it, but you'll feel better that you can at least articulate your feelings. Best of luck!"

crossdressing,38dhl5,tinariddle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"that is the kind of top that needs pants, I say. Get some leggings or shorts since you seem confident enough with your legs :)  The skirt needs a top that's shorter in length, and with sleeves. With skirts I'd aim to keep the bottom of the top in line with the top of the skirt in terms of length, having a big overlap like that can break an otherwise cute skirted-outfit and make it look unplanned!  Just keep doing what you're doing!"
crossdressing,38dhl5,Hollied,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"This. Exactly what I was going to say!  To add, you could also try matching colors based on their shades.Darker shades go better with white and like shades. Same with summery/eastery type of colors. That's why you usually see girls with that kind of top and maybe some mint or white denim shorts or something."

crossdressing,38g97g,IwishIweregirly,4,Thu Jun 4 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"don't think addiction is the word you're looking for. but yes, people who do it get satisfaction out of it. and many find it to be a release, relaxing. it could be just like anything else that makes you happy, like buying clothes or dunking on middle school kids at the rec. and of course it's especially satisfying for those with dysphoria."
crossdressing,38g97g,cthulhumysterio,2,Thu Jun 4 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to your personal issues of depression. I'm no psychologist. But being a selective closet crossdresser for years, i have noticed something that might be important for you. Crossdressing is not really something you do so much as it is something you are. (Yes it's an activity, but it's also an identity thing) You enjoy crossdressing because it's part of who you are. You miss it because you have to hide it. It makes you feel good because it's when you feel most true to yourself. Imagine if you were gay but you had to pretend to be straight. You would deny that part of yourself engaging in behaviours and activities you wouldnt identify with. You'd be constantly hiding yourself. It's madening and it takes it's toll. But when you finally get to be yourself, it's like heaven. I doubt you have a gender dysphoria or something like it. If you are concerned please consult a professional, but i dont think there's anything wrong here. You sound pretty normal to me."

I own a lot heels more than shoes, tops are about even since they're harder to fit a male frame but own quite a few sleeveless, and of course dresses and skirts. And my fav type of underwears cheeksters and boyshorts ;) but yeah shopping online or in store is stress relief and even just painting your nails"
crossdressing,38g97g,littlemissfuzzy,2,Thu Jun 4 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not addicted, but I have gotten used to it quite quickly :) Even my daughter doesn't think it's too weird that daddy wears a nighty to bed :p   I've been in a bit of a depressive bout, and the thing that seemed to fix it was browsing female clothes such as dresses and skirts and whatnot.   Well that's a common thing :) A lot of people go shopping to deal with their bad feelings.   Putting that aside: best of luck to you!"

crossdressing,38d30k,verbenasFaros,4,Wed Jun 3 13:00:45 2015 UTC,"Crossdressing is definitely an exclusive thing from homosexuality (as many or most of us know firsthand).  The only two people I've come out to are gay, my housemate and his boyfriend.  My housemate said ""I don't really understand crossdressing, but of course I don't judge you.""  He dislikes drag shows.  I've changed my mind on this since I last discussed it, and do believe that CDing falls under the trans umbrella.  Now, I'm not saying someone who CDs and still likes being a guy has it as hard as someone who always feels they were born into the wrong gender.  But CDs still don't fall into the strict gender binary that is (unfortunately) the standard we are expected to follow."
crossdressing,38d30k,urRoommateKyogre,2,Wed Jun 3 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"I've changed my mind on this since I last discussed it, and do believe that CDing falls under the trans umbrella.    Agreed, but I have also heard another term in recent posts that seems to describe me pretty well: bi-gender.  It seems to describe one who is comfortable in both gender roles.  For example, when I am dressed and presenting as Hollie, I feel feminine, like a woman named Hollie.  When I am presenting as my male self, I feel masculine, like a dude.  However, I always feel that there is a small part of Hollie deep down inside of my male self and a small part of my male self deep down inside me while I'm Hollie.  For me, the most important thing I feel in either gender is balance.  When I don't feel balanced, that's when I realize something's wrong.  Now do I think ""bi-gender"" falls under the Trans umbrella?  Absolutely!  I just feel that the Trans umbrella may be much larger than any of us (or anyone else) may fathom.  Just my $.02 USD."
crossdressing,38d30k,Hollied,2,Thu Jun 4 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts.  I can identify with the ""balance"" concept.    For me, I can't say I dress because inside I ""feel like a girl"", which seems to be what a lot of TG people say (so obviously the psychology is different).  I was born a male, raised a male, and have generally had a good life that way, comfortable in my skin.  However, there is some sense of femininity that needs to be released sometimes.  I feel out of balance when I have all my girl clothes locked away for a long time, and I also begin to feel out of balance if I've been dressed all day.  The thing I find difficult with the concept of gender fluidity is that most of our concepts of ""gender"" are social constructs.  Besides sexual organs, literally everything is feminine or masculine because people decided it was so.  To me, liking heels /= feeling like a girl.  I like heels because they're sexy, and something that compliments who I'm attracted to (girls).  In a different universe, heels might still be worn by men.  My end game is really, ""screw the norms"".  My personality doesn't like following rules because ""that's just the way it is"".  That's not a good enough reason.  Yeah, I still have a fear of social repercussions if I were to become more open with it, but I'll cross that bridge if I get to it."
crossdressing,38d30k,urRoommateKyogre,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:36:19 2015 UTC,I also like that term and find myself identifying as bi-gender more and more. You described how I feel about gender almost perfectly.
crossdressing,38d30k,jessicas65,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. Depending on motivation, cds often have a lot of commonalities with trans people. I think your housemate's reaction is pretty typical. It's a hard thing to understand if you don't do it."
crossdressing,38d30k,urRoommateKyogre,5,Wed Jun 3 14:37:00 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to be very clear on the differences between CDs and transgender people, but I think there are plenty of times when it's really important to stick together.   At the end of the day, we all get attacked by the same people for the same reasons."

crossdressing,38d30k,sexymcluvin,2,Wed Jun 3 15:32:13 2015 UTC,My understanding of queer as a term is that it's pretty broad.  Which is nice.  I totally identify as a queer person at this point.

As you can see, there is room for both. Gender queer I think fuses both sexuality and gender expression.  Either way, I feel like it's a good fit and the broad term of LGBTQ can include straight crossdressers. There were all sorts of identities present at my city's pride parade.

crossdressing,38cjko,BiToTheBone,3,Wed Jun 3 09:51:40 2015 UTC,"I have a fun story for this!  I was in college, and I had already admitted to my roommates (and the two girls that could have been our bros pretty much ) one drunken ""tell your deepest darkest secret"" nights that I crossdress. Well, I was changing in the bathroom, and one of my roommates said they were going to meet an old friend of theirs and asked if I wanted to go. I said no, since I was almost fixed up, with makeup and everything, but he said, nah, just go like that anyways. Don't know what came over me, but I said, sure, why not?  So I get there, and it's normal, but I can't talk since I don't have a voice. My cover story was that my name was Tina, 2nd year poli sci major. Totally not my major, and the name was randomly chosen by my roommate,but I went with it. Anyways, the guy keeps trying to get me to open up, but I still kept my mouth shut and looked all awkward, until I finally decide to let him in on the joke. He said he knew, but he totally didn't.   I kept the name, because my roommates were so open and willing to let me be myself.   I say choose a name that means something to you, and that's how you choose. It also helps to see if it fits you at all."
crossdressing,38cjko,tinariddle,3,Wed Jun 3 10:19:58 2015 UTC,"for me, it's silly and i don't like to explain it, but sure it's all safe here.  I'm a little bit of a nerd, and at the time I liked animated series, I liked Supergirl.  Her name is Kara, so I took that. I felt that it suited me since as a girl i'm a little stronger than the majority of other girls (being male has that advantage) it was also a little bit of a smirk because of the secret identity thing.  the name is short, cute, easy to remember. i just felt it worked.  i also didn't like the female version of my own name. i like to joke that i am my own twin sister so that means the name has to be different."

crossdressing,38b5fi,ana07,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:42:43 2015 UTC,"Passable is dependent on each person. Your mannerisms, how you wear your clothes and how you carry yourself are all ways to pass. Just find your look, then fine tune it to go move towards passing. Your wife is very supportive and you're lucky. If she's willing, she can help you with mannerisms and the general direction of passing better than most of us. Just be careful and ask how she feels about it, because as supportive as they can be, they might also want a man around the house, especially if you came out to them after dating/being married for a while, unless you want to transition. Or they might judge you as selfish, as you might be looking in the mirror more often at yourself than at her. If you both have been doing this for a while, then you know what I'm talking about. I've just heard stories of women being supportive before and all of a sudden change their mind. To each their own, I guess."

They are too busy with their own life. The problem is in your head. You have the gift of gender fluidity. There many benefits to that gift.
crossdressing,38a9pl,susanking1956,2,Tue Jun 2 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"Movies seem like a decent idea actually. Maybe start off with a few discreet items, then slowly work my way up. Thanks!  Now all I need is money to go to the movies with, heh."
crossdressing,38a9pl,letterstosnapdragon,2,Tue Jun 2 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"What worked for me (and this was back in the mid-90s when no one had heard of transgender people), was coming out to a close female friend. You're coming out of your shell at a great time to be doing so.   Accept that you're going to be bad at dressing for a while. For a long time I was awful. It will take practice. Confidence takes practice too! You're going to be awkward and nervous at first. You've just got to girl up and power through it!   As for your mom finding out...I went out dressed up when I was 16, in the 90s, in suburban Georgia, with parents who were super Evangelical Republicans. If they ever suspected anything, they never said so. You can hide it till college (don't worry!).   Just find a cool friend to confide in, who'll help you through the early stages! And accept that it all takes time. You'll be fine and you'll be fabulous!"
crossdressing,38a9pl,letterstosnapdragon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"I have some close friends who do know, however, the sheer majority are across the ocean, over in America while I'm here in England. I know friends who I would probably come out to if I had that confidence, but it's just taking that step is always difficult for me.  And yeah, I know I'm gonna be bad, practice makes perfect after all. But if I manage to get the confidence, I am gonna need help for Halloween. No way I can improve that much in so little time.  And that story does actually help somewhat. Your situation was a lot more precarious than mine, so thanks for that, seriously.  Thanks for the advice though!"
crossdressing,38a9pl,letterstosnapdragon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"Halloween? It's barely June! You have so much time to experiment and play around with looks. You'd be surprised how much you can grow in 6 months. If you're not confident yet, maybe try practicing in private first. That'll help you get up the confidence to come out a friend (or find a friend online!).   I don't mean any of this to say it's easy to overcome your fears. It is super difficult, but you can do it!"
crossdressing,38a9pl,GBBL,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, for the majority of those six months, I am unable to practice at all. My mother has campling planned for basically the entire summer holidays, and during school time she gets home shortly after I do, and has weekends off. The only real time I might get to practice is during half term, or during inset days, both of which are few and far between. :c"

At Halloween, no matter how you look you will still have so much fun. And you'll be at a party and some female friend will compliment you and say ""Next time I'll do your makeup for you"" and you'll be in!   Just have fun. Confidence will grow with time."
crossdressing,38a9pl,GBBL,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is to find a close female friend to come out to and have her show you the ropes. After that, fake it till you make it honey. Even if you dont feel confidant, act like it and people with believe you. The first time going out is always the worst and then it gets easier every time. Good luck and feel free to PM me if you need any help with makeup, colors, or confidence!"
crossdressing,38a9pl,susanking1956,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"^ this.  You'd be surprised how much girls are willing and eager to dress guys up. Whoever you ask, have her help with makeup and clothing a few times and you'll just naturally pick it up. Also, go as someone that could be fun but easily covered up as a Halloween gag in case your mom were to somehow find out. Marilyn Monroe ? lady Gaga ? You get where that's going. Oh and one thing I've yet to master but read is a HUGE confidence builder is ""the walk"". If you can strut like a girll, everything else will fall into place. Good luck and enjoy yourself :)"
crossdressing,38a9pl,tinariddle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:27:36 2015 UTC,Yup. Strut like a girl. Adjust your body pose to that of a girl and you will pass :)
crossdressing,38a9pl,tinariddle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I actually have a friend who I would ask if I had the confidence, I know she's accepting of transgender people, we've had conversations about drag queens and she honestly seemed rather curious about them (though honestly I'd rather not go drag queen style, because that tends to focus a tad too much on being ott and being obviously in drag) but you get the picture. The only thing I need now is to get over my anxiety issues and actually ask her."
crossdressing,38a9pl,CDHunter,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:59:54 2015 UTC,That is how I started. I went to a few matinees.

crossdressing,388w7j,pancakeonmyhead,2,Wed Jun 3 00:30:21 2015 UTC,Thanks I trying to look as passable as possible! Thank you for looking out for me!
crossdressing,389zj6,urRoommateKyogre,2,Tue Jun 2 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"The only advice I have is do things at your own pace.  Don't feel like you need to do everything at once.    Going out in public is thrilling and I definitely recommend it.  Your experience will vary based on where you are and how passable you can get.  In any case you'll find most people are concerned with their own business, and you can take comfort in that anyone who does notice will be more uncomfortable than you (their problem)."
crossdressing,389zj6,tinariddle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I have crossed dressed in public before, although only wearing a small bra and pair of knickers under my street clothes as not to draw attention to myself. I would like to do it again as it was a bit of an exhilarating experience and allowed me to step out of my comfort zone for a little while. But I agree that I should go at my own pace."
