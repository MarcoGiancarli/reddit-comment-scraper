Given that their first reaction to any outsiders has been violence it's possible that they have other less than friendly societal traits: what if they're into things that we call barbaric? Cannibalism, human sacrifice, and similar practices weren't unheard of in societies of similar tech levels.   There is nothing ""pure"" about their situation. Much like those who romanticize the past, stating that societies such as this are more pure or natural than ours ignore the facets of those societies that we would find anathema to our own sense of morals or basics of human society. At the very least, it ignores that life ""back in the old days"" was riddled with disease, poor nutrition, and overall less comfortable and shorter lives.   Not attacking you...just that people calling uncontacted tribes, native american societies, and ancient peoples ""pure"" ignores the fact that life was, in Thomas Hobbes' words, ""nasty, brutish, and short.""

Same goes with the Balkans.

Even when I was 10 years old or so there wasn't enough foot room for me.   The straw that broke the camel's back was the roof leaking constantly (in a city with some of the highest rainfall in the US), and doing so on live TV during a big basketball game being broadcast.   A lot of plans were put on the table, but all of them except the Bass Pro Shop were going to cost the city money, where as Bass Pro Shop were willing to give the city money.   That money has been used to do things like rebuild roads all over the city, tear down and/or rennovate buildings that have been vacant since MLK was shot, and build bike lanes and paths all over the city (which have been a massive hit, for everyone regardless of demographic).

Several OTH radar systems were deployed starting in the 1950s and 1960s as part of early warning radar systems, but these have generally been replaced by airborne early warning systems instead. OTH radars have recently been making a comeback, as the need for accurate long-range tracking becomes less important with the ending of the Cold War, and less-expensive ground based radars are once again being considered for roles such as maritime reconnaissance and drug enforcement.

CivPolitics,3102zh,captainfranklen,2,Wed Apr 1 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"It was a craze to rival the Hula-Hoop, and even less explicable. For a mere three dollars and 95 cents, a consumer could buy ... a rock — a plain, ordinary, egg-shaped rock of the kind one could dig up in almost any backyard.  The wonder of it was, for a few frenzied months in 1975, more than a million consumers did, becoming the proud if slightly abashed owners of Pet Rocks, the fad that Newsweek later called “one of the most ridiculously successful marketing schemes ever.”  Gary Dahl, the man behind that scheme — described variously as a marketing genius and a genial mountebank — died on March 23 at 78. A down-at-the-heels advertising copywriter when he hit on the idea, he originally meant it as a joke. But the concept of a “pet” that required no actual work and no real commitment resonated with the self-indulgent ’70s, and before long a cultural phenomenon was born.  A modern incarnation of “Stone Soup” as stirred by P. T. Barnum, Pet Rocks made Mr. Dahl a millionaire practically overnight. Though the fad ran its course long ago, the phrase “pet rock” endures in the American lexicon, denoting (depending on whether it is uttered with contempt or admiration) a useless entity or a meteoric success.  But despite the boon Pet Rocks brought him, Mr. Dahl came to regret the brainstorm that gave rise to them in the first place.  Mr. Dahl’s brainstorm began, as many do, in a bar.  One night in the mid-’70s, he was having a drink in Los Gatos, the Northern California town where he lived for many years. At the time, he was a freelance copywriter (“that’s another word for being broke,” he later said), living in a small cabin as a self-described “quasi dropout.”  The bar talk turned to pets, and to the onus of feeding, walking and cleaning up after them.  His pet, Mr. Dahl announced in a flash of bibulous inspiration, caused him no such trouble. The reason?  “I have a pet rock,” he explained.  A pet rock, Mr. Dahl quickly realized, might just have legs.  “People are so damn bored, tired of all their problems,” he told People magazine in 1975. “This takes them on a fantasy trip — you might say we’ve packaged a sense of humor.”  He recruited two colleagues as investors, visited a building-supply store and bought a load of smooth Mexican beach stones at about a penny apiece.  The genius was in the packaging. Each Pet Rock came in a cardboard carrying case, complete with air holes, tenderly nestled on a bed of excelsior. Mr. Dahl’s droll masterstroke was his accompanying manual on the care, feeding and house training of Pet Rocks.  “If, when you remove the rock from its box it appears to be excited, place it on some old newspapers,” the manual read. “The rock will know what the paper is for and will require no further instruction. It will remain on the paper until you remove it.”  Pet Rocks hit the marketplace in time for Christmas 1975. They were soon featured on “The Tonight Show” and in a blizzard of newspaper articles. In a matter of months, some 1.5 million rocks were sold.  “I had one phone to each ear,” Mr. Dahl recalled in a 2011 interview. “I taught my P.R. guy to impersonate me so he could also answer my calls.”  Mr. Dahl traded his Honda for a Mercedes and moved into a house with a swimming pool that was larger than his cabin had been.  Gary Ross Dahl was born on Dec. 18, 1936, in Bottineau, N.D., and reared in Spokane, Wash. His mother was a waitress, his father a lumber-mill worker. After studying at what is now Washington State University, the young Mr. Dahl made his way into advertising.  While Pet Rocks were the must-have gift of the 1975 holiday season, they soon went the way of all fads. The idea’s very simplicity proved its undoing: Though Mr. Dahl trademarked the name, there was nothing to stop someone from putting a rock into a box and selling it, and many did. Nor did the spate of auxiliary businesses that sprang up around his creation — the official Bicentennial Pet Rock, inscribed with an American flag; mail-order college degrees for Pet Rocks ($3 for a bachelor’s, $10 for a Ph.D.) — bring him any compensation.  In the late ’70s, Mr. Dahl was sued by his original investors, who claimed they had received too small a share of the profits. A court found in their favor, and he was obliged to pay a six-figure judgment. His later inventions, including the Original Sand Breeding Kit, which let buyers grow their “own desert wasteland,” never matched the success of Pet Rocks.  Mr. Dahl’s first marriage, to Barbara Eisiminger, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Melinda Aucott. His survivors include his third wife, the former Marguerite Wood, who confirmed his death, in Jacksonville, Ore., from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; a sister, Candace Dahl; two children, Christine Nunez and Eric Dahl, from his first marriage; a daughter, Samantha Leighton, from his second; a stepdaughter, Vicki Pershing; and seven grandchildren.  On the proceeds of Pet Rocks, Mr. Dahl opened a saloon and ran a sailboat brokerage before returning to advertising. He was the author of “Advertising for Dummies,” first published in 2001.  Mr. Dahl, a resident most recently of Jacksonville, was also vastly proud of having won, in 2000, the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, which honors deliberately dreadful prose. (His winning entry began, “The heather-encrusted Headlands, veiled in fog as thick as smoke in a crowded pub, hunched precariously over the moors.”)  But in the end, it is for the Pet Rock that he will be remembered. Though the rock made him wealthy, it also made him wary, for he was besieged ever after by hordes of would-be inventors, seeking his advice on the next big thing.  “There’s a bizarre lunatic fringe who feel I owe them a living,” Mr. Dahl told The Associated Press in 1988. “Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn’t have been simpler if I hadn’t done it.”"

After 10 years, Jordan can choose another supplier.   They must be playing with a mod cause deals are usually 30 turns (or 30 years in late game right?) that allows shorter deals (which is a great idea). However when that deals up Jordan has a few options for uranium from other countries, like Kazakhstan who makes 37.8% of all world wide uranium production; or Niger the next-highest nation close enough to supply them cheaply (#4 with 7.6%).  However they could also make a deal with Australia (10.7%) OR Canada (15.7%) for different nuclear reactors (Canada sold China nuclear reactors and Uranium)."

And possession is 9/10ths of the law unfortunately.   Whether something is ""true"" or not doesn't matter in the realm of geopolitics.

Are you really naive enough to think that every single country's world map interpretation is the same? I hope not.   And when I said unfortunately possession is 9/10ths of the law what did you think that meant for International borders? That there is an actual line there everyone will automatically respect forever? That land is actually cordoned off into 'territories', retaining 100% of their area regardless of who currently owns it?  We have been seeing disregard for them quite a bit lately. And not just in the Russian region. Again, I never implied any of this was good.  Recently, land has been relatively stable, but who is going to stop a land grab by a motivated nation? The UN because these are ""internationally respected borders""? That's not going to happen.  There is a huge emphasis on de facto and de jure borders in the rest of the world, things are not so set as the 50 states.

And it's not just greece, even on the national level in Germany this is going to explode, since the local governments are in a similar boat.  The only two countries that openly defied that logic are Island and Argentine.

Nuclear power is overwhelmingly safe, at least in the west (safer than coal, statistically). I get about 1/3 of my electricity from a nuclear power station, and I wouldn't mind seeing that proportion increase.   Nuclear power is clean, safe, and reasonably cheap, we need it if we're ever going to do away with fossil fuels.  EDIT: Wait, how did we jump topics like that?"

And I disagree with both of you. Systems that need to be actively moderated lest they go critical are bad design. In terms of capitalism it is trying to constantly adapt redistribution of excess, until that system fails. In reactors it is the same idea.  Both are not inherent in the base concept, but the specific design. And in both there is very little interest in seeking a solution, because people think that either can be answered with a ""yes/no"" question."

In that way we are acting the role of policemen; but as Smith so eloquently states, we are also policing for the sake of our own interests, in this technologically advanced and ever shrinking international community."

CivPolitics,2uebdm,Cordapio,9,Sun Feb 1 10:35:40 2015 UTC,"It's fascinating what he is doing, but I feel like limiting archery to either ""quick movement combat"" or ""hollywood/sport"" is negatively affecting the message.  It feels like ""long range stationary precision shooting"" is as valuable to a commander as ""mid range mobile shooting"". Just with different applications."
CivPolitics,2uebdm,DaHolk,3,Sun Feb 1 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this video kinda feels offensive to any professional archer. There have been people who have been doing archery for decades and then someone comes out and says they're doing it completely wrong. The techniques he shows off aren't lost but just replaced with often better ones. Most archers aren't doing these tricks (which are cool don't get me wrong) but instead focusing on accuracy."
CivPolitics,2uebdm,Purplegill10,5,Sun Feb 1 19:25:59 2015 UTC,professional archers would be the long distance archers like the mentioned in the video. the purpose of the video was to point out that archery has changed with the onset of firearms (or even crossbows). The mid range mobile archery discipline went away with no one really passing it down except in old pictures like what this guy observed.  professional archers are also not combatants like what archers of the past would be. if archers became combatants again then these styles would probably be revived.
CivPolitics,2uebdm,Purplegill10,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but I just feel like him saying that the way archers are currently shooting is wrong is, well, wrong."
CivPolitics,2uebdm,DaHolk,5,Sun Feb 1 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Lets put is this way. This way is more flexible, resource efficient and had more diverse practical application. So from that perspective one could say it's ""better"".  On the other hand the applications they have are entirely different, so ""right and wrong"" is something arguing outside the scope.  So.. I see where it comes from, but I agree that it is worded to strongly, to the point of being contentious. I would argue it is ""wrong"" that this aspect has been ignored over the common one, though."

CivPolitics,2uck8f,SahinK,6,Mon Feb 2 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"That thing is mobile? How long has that been possible and how mobile is it?  I remember that the Metal Gear games would usually come up with some kind of mechanism using rocket engines or railguns to actually make them mobile, so I've kinda assumed it doesn't exist IRL.  However, in MGS they have a much longer range than that thing IIRC, which might be a reason? However, I'm not certain about the range since it can be confusing to just hear 5000 kilometres and not have a map or proper measurements to go by, 5000, might very well be almost the same range as they have in MGS"
CivPolitics,2uck8f,grey_lollipop,12,Sun Feb 1 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Mobile ICBMs have been in military service since the 1970s. Several other countries have developed them, though only China and Russia have really made use of them. Western nations decided that sub-based ICBMs were a more reliable option, and various treaties also squelched their deployment."
CivPolitics,2uck8f,Watchung,3,Sun Feb 1 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that I think about, it does sound odd not being able to fire them anywhere, however, that 40 ton thing you linked to isn't exactly what's in MGS either, I'm guessing it needed roads and was pretty slow withouth them, not the kind of all terrain high speed things you see in MGS, so that might be why they didn't just put ICBMs on a normal vehicle. Also, what would MGS be without giant unrealisticly cool mechs?"
