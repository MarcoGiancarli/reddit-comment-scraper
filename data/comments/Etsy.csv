Etsy,3e66yl,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"After doing a bit of research on the Etsy forums and crunching numbers, I've decided on 15% off most of the items in my shop.    I feel it's too spam-y to post the code here, so PM me if you'd like it!"
Etsy,3e66yl,kinyutaka,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:41:33 2015 UTC,"You can see if the code can be limited.  Just as an example 20% off to a maximum of $10.  If they buy $75 of stuff, they'll get $10 off.  But if you have no room for a discount on the $50 items, maybe they should be priced a little higher."
Etsy,3e66yl,vintagekaren,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"I generally use 15% off coupons. I know you can set a minimum purchase, but haven't seen one for maximum."
Etsy,3e4al6,Branical,4,Tue Jul 21 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"No, but on Kickstarter you're helping ideas get off the ground. On etsy you'd just be pledging to buy more stuff, yay capitalism. It doesn't really make sense.  There are places that promote goods from Etsy stores, but even those have largely turned into a pay for feature model which means they're taking money away from stores.   I'm on Etsy to make money, so I wouldn't be pledging a percent of my income to other people on Etsy. I buy there first when it makes sense, but laser toner is expensive so I can't see ever signing up for this sort of thing.   I think most stores still don't turn a profit so many of the pledges would be symbolic or lopsided.  Etsy does now have an affiliate program in the US, so there's nothing stopping someone from making money off of a site that shares Etsy stuff and setting something like this up."
Etsy,3e4al6,courtneyj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:32 2015 UTC,Not that I know of.  /r/etsy allows users to share their stores and offer them up for constructive criticism. We also offer a lot of positive troubleshooting and assistance to other sellers in a safe environment which is outside of the standard etsy forum.  This allows us to freely share about all things etsy related -even competitive sites and best practices for sellers to grow outside of sales only on etsy.  I know that for me the growth that I have had from participating here has accounted for some of my growth. That's a big part of why I'm always here (many others too) helping others out.
Etsy,3e45bt,dilly_pickle,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"There are other platforms, but the draw of Etsy is that it has millions of users searching for products. There are some places like Storenvy and Artfire which have similar setups but don't get a giant traffic draw. When you build a site using Shopify, WooCommerce or BigCartel you're responsible for drawing all your own traffic, which comes at significant costs. Lots of people end up spending more time on SEO, social media and marketing to get their shops off the ground. That's the biggest plus in etsy right now, a large built in organic audience."
Etsy,3e45bt,courtneyj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:49:17 2015 UTC,I'm interested in this too. I eventually want to branch out. I think Etsy is a good start because it can be sort of an initial test to see if there's a market for your product. You can test to see what items sell and what items don't.

Etsy,3e1wym,LittleBlueEyes,2,Tue Jul 21 09:19:25 2015 UTC,"i'm a photographer, but don't sell any photos on etsy. some thoughts on a few of your questions   --Most of what I shoot is nature photography. How saturated is that market? The jewelry market is so full that my little shop isn't getting noticed!   Try marketing to specific areas where the photos were taken. You would be surprised how many people are looking for art from their hometown. I am a return customer of a photographer on Etsy who shoots what appear to be a simple forest, but are actual trees from my husband's home state. Photos like that can be memorable. Perhaps tags, titles and descriptions targeting their location can help with saturation.   --I hear it's best to print your work, frame it, and show a photo of THAT when listing the actual photograph for sale. Less theft of your digital photo, etc. I can't do that. Better to use lower-res images on the item listing, or what?   This is a great idea. However, a mixture would be great as well. I enjoy browsing larger prints when they are displayed to show scale. Perhaps, being held up by someone. But ensure that you remain consistent with that method. Show a photo of your work in someone's home. In a frame on the wall, etc. If you could create a template of some sort so that all you did was switch out your prints in the staged photo using Photoshop, that would be easiest.   --How on earth does one figure out prices? I know the standard formula: (hourly wage x hours spent) + supplies + any profit = price to charge. But how does that work for photography?   This sort of goes along with your next question, but I would include the price of your work in the price of the cost of shipping supplies. Have you ever ordered anything from Shutterfly? They handle it very well. Cardboard envelope with cardboard sheet for small prints, and cardboard tubes or oblong boxes for larger prints. It is expensive to ship photography, so this is a tough one. Include the cost it takes to print, and do a comparison to other photographers in your area on Etsy. It's not about being the cheapest, it's about offering the best work. Like I said, this is a tough one.   You could always try selling your work in 'batches', too. Buy 2 get the 3rd free, or something along those lines...  Good luck!"
Etsy,3e1wym,mollyjoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:35 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of marketing to specific areas!  I know the location of almost all of the nature photos I've taken.  Great idea!  I'll add the location into the title/tags.    How can larger prints be displayed to show scale?  If I do open a shop, I was going to list different size options under ""variations"".  For example, a 3x5 print, a 6x8 print, etc.  All the standard sizes, plus the option to order a custom size.    I don't have photoshop, and am not talented with any free photo editor, either.  I don't edit my photography.    How DO I figure the price of my work, though?  I know to include shipping costs.  I'll look around for other photographers.    Thanks for the help!  The idea of a print being held up by someone is great.  But I'm low income, and can't just go making prints of a certain photo in a certain size and just HOPE it sells.  I was planning to not print the photos out until/unless they are purchased!"

The moolah is an incentive (because my hobbies are expensive to maintain) but I wouldn't do it if I didn't like what I was doing as well. I felt the same as you when I first started off selling crochet items but I tried to find little details that would differentiate myself some other people's item. I like to make practical items so, when I was designing my mason jar cozies, I added handles and used wool to make carrying easier and to soak up condensation. I also tried to think up some more unique/cute designs like my Frakenstein's monster cozy and cat cozy. Anything I could do to make my items a little more different and unique.   After a while I came up with a new idea of making origami tea bags which (as I can tell now) are still unique to the Etsy market. It takes a while to come up with new ideas but half the fun is brainstorming and coming up with new ideas that you want to make into reality. Prototyping is always fun for me so that motivates me a lot."

Etsy,3dw91e,scottishpride,3,Mon Jul 20 03:56:40 2015 UTC,When you post items onto etsy you can add options such as different colors or finishes but I would suggest posting what you have and see how they do. It does take a while to get your stores name out there so people see it. Check out /r/etsy for how to advertise.   I would definitely suggest getting some sort of hanger for the back it will not add that much cost and will improve the value.

Etsy,3dw91e,StitchyFox,4,Mon Jul 20 03:57:35 2015 UTC,"I would finish the edges on the square pieces so that the edge is in the same finish as the front of the piece, instead of pine. I might add an option for buyers to choose a metal bit for hanging or not. I can see how it might be frustrating for some people to have that on, and i assume it's just a quick hammer tap to add the metal bit.  For the pieces that are trunk cross sections with actual bark, I think you could charge more than the square designs. I might put a $10-15 premium on them, depending on the size/quality of the wood.  I really like the simple style of the designs - it's a really beautiful aesthetic. I might design some animals that are a little more elegant -- I'm not quite sure what I mean by that, but I guess your pieces have a childlike joyfulness in them. I could see some people wanting a carving that was a little more stern than the designs you have so far. Like this or this. But I think your pieces are beautiful, and what I suggested there is only if you want to expand your audience more and more. I wouldn't change the current designs at all, and I think the consistency of your aesthetic is great.  Your work has a great opportunity for custom orders, which you can also charge more for. People could choose their own designs, their finishes, and their wood type, and you could do custom orders that way. In addition to your standard carvings that you've shown us here, you could design digital drawings for people to select from.   The first user's input on pricing is right though. you should be paying yourself - at minimum - $20 an hour for labor, plus material costs, x2 (minimum) for retail. It's better to high-ball than to lowball. Then work your way down if product isn't selling.  :)"

I'm flattered that you like the designs, and I completely agree with what you said about possibly adding more serious-looking designs (it has actually crossed my mind before). I'll also probably charge a premium on the pieces with the bark (which should work out great for me, since they're actually cheaper and easier to make than the pieces without bark), and I'll definitely leave an option for custom orders (do some people make custom orders on etsy? I'm not sure how I would approach that, because most of the stuff I've seen haven't been custom orders, I think...). Thanks again for the help!"
Etsy,3dxzw3,PureMerakiDesigns,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:47 2015 UTC,Your stuff looks very nice and I'm surprised it isn't selling. I'm no expert on SEO but my first thought is the beginning of your listing title is VERY specific. Perhaps that is limiting your views. I don't actually have any advice on how to fix that though. There are some very smart people that follow this subreddit that should be able to help you though.
Etsy,3dxzw3,locustandplum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"Thank so much for the kind feedback, I appreciate it :) SEO seems to be never-ending and very difficult to achieve, lol. I've tweaked tags and titles so many times, I just need to find that sweet spot."
Etsy,3dxzw3,maria_ivanovna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"I would also change primitive in the title maybe to minimalist. Also the best way to get ideas to your tags and titles is to search for similar items and see how people describe it. When you were getting 100 views a day when did these views come from? Did they come from search or promotions? I was looking at your never stop dreaming piece and the color of the piece is slightly different in couple pictures: some show silver letters, some show white letters. And instead  of photographing your art outside, take photos at home, so the buyer can imagine how it would fit in their home decor. EDIT:  another quick look at your shop: if I was searching for your kind of items, I would probably be searching for inspirational sign, inspirational wooden block, motivational art, etc. maybe try to include that in your tags titles."
Etsy,3dxzw3,jmk816,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the tips, Maria. After you pointed out the color of the lettering being off, I did look and I see what you're saying. I'm thinking it's probably the angle of the shot as well as the sunlight hitting it that's making it appear white. I have starting taking some photos on a white background at home instead of out in nature after some feedback. I personally think the ones outside come out better looking but have been told they are too busy. I'll definitely add in the tags you suggested, thanks again!"

At that point, my photos weren't that great, my tags were terrible so I'm not sure how I was getting them."
Etsy,3dxzw3,locustandplum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"I can help you figure that out! If you go to the dashboard, under the quick links, there is one called stats. Go there you'll see a drop down menu that is stats for: xxx. You can do it for specific dates- so set that to when things were going well. Through that you can see traffic sources, specifically etsy sources and keywords.  My guess is that in the beginning you were adding a lot of postings. New postings are the best way to get more traffic. Instead of putting everything up at once, it's better to post one or two a day for a longer period of time.   Also on a production note, I think it would be good to look into including hardware to hang the pieces. I feel like a lot of people looking for decor want stuff they can hand on their walls."
Etsy,3dxzw3,locustandplum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, JMK I was planning on editing the listings to offer installation of the hardware, some of the listings already have it I just need to add it to those that don't have it.

Etsy,3dwi1y,tom8o,3,Mon Jul 20 03:48:05 2015 UTC,it depends on what the item is and what your queue is like. I make made to order items and explicitly remind my customers that the longest wait is 5 weeks. in most cases I complete early and in return get a positive review. it's best to give yourself more time than you need so that your customers will not get frustrated.
Etsy,3dwi1y,mollyjoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on the time and skill that goes into making the item... I've heard of couturiers with 6-month waiting lists. But for simple made-to-order items, I think up to 6 weeks is reasonable. I think it's better to tell customers it could be ""Up to 6 weeks"" and then send it after 3 weeks, versus saying ""2-3"" weeks and taking the same amount of time... I always get excited about receiving items ""early""."

Etsy,3dwi1y,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:57:14 2015 UTC,"I think as long as your shipping profiles/policies reflect the wait, no customer really has a right to complain if you actually do take that long.  For me, my custom orders are all in the 1-2 week range (and I can usually get them out within a few days if time permits), but I'm not super high volume.  If I was looking to buy, I would be willing to wait a month for something I really wanted. Maybe even more if it's not a gift for someone and/or I'm not in a hurry to get it. As long as the shop was clear about the wait, I wouldn't worry about it, personally."
Etsy,3dw3gs,et_fingers,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"Did you email them directly, or did you just use etsy convo? If you haven't emailed them directly, try that first. If they don't respond, cancel the order with a note explaining the situation. I've had to do that and the customer immediately responded and repurchased the item.   Edit: also, I'm just curious, is there a reason you don't have the band size as a variation choice? Seems like it would be easier that way."
Etsy,3dw3gs,bubuloobu,2,Mon Jul 20 00:58:13 2015 UTC,Is sending them a convo not the same as emailing them? Isn't the email address attached to the account?

I am still in the trial and error phase though.
Etsy,3dw3gs,bubuloobu,3,Mon Jul 20 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"No, sending them a convo doesn't necessarily mean they'll get a notification in their regular email, and if they don't often log into etsy, they won't know you messaged them. You can get their actual email address from the order.   I understand what you mean about feeling less discriminatory, but I think I would still list a handful of average sizes and a  ""custom- leave message"" option just to make it easier.

Etsy,3dw3gs,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"I had one customer purchase the most expensive item in my shop.  I was thrilled!  She sent me a message saying that she wanted to discuss her choice of colors.  I was expecting to hear that.    What I was NOT expecting was for her to disappear off the face of the planet after that.  I waited over a week, I think closer to two, and then refunded her money with many regrets.  (After I messaged her through Etsy and her email but heard nothing back.)    How long has it been since the buyer ordered that item from you?  I asked on the forums of Etsy and was told to wait 1-2 weeks before refunding, which I did."

Natural light is great, but you want indirect light. Set up in the shade. Direct light is very harsh, creates strong shadows, and can mess with your colors. Be aware of surroundings - we have a red patio umbrella, and shooting under that gives a red cast to the pictures. And absolutely experiment with your camera settings, particularly for white balance and focus.  I try to do as much in-camera as possible, then adjust the levels in a paint program.

Personally speaking, I've never seen an item like this in any store.   If you need them immediately, have you considered trying to search for a DIY tutorial to make your own set? Best of luck!"

Etsy,3dswa5,puzzledflamingo,0,Sun Jul 19 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"A decent seller will respond to your shipping request fairly quickly.   But, I think enough info is there to get a good idea. She says she ships every day during the week and ships first class, depending on where you're at it shouldn't take more than week.  She says she ships from KC. I used to live near there in zip 66213. Take it to usps.com and run a quote for 3oz package from 66213 to your zip...the very last option will be first class. If you run a quote for any specific service just to get the quote started you'll probably need to click a ""see more options"" link. It'll give you an estimated delivery date. Just assume if you buy today she will ship it on Monday. Or if you buy on a week day it will ship the next day."

Etsy,3dnp28,spacydoge,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"Your tags and titles look fine.  I compared your photos to 3 bird nest and they're at least as good, so that's not the issue for slow sales.  My recommendation.  Best bang for you buck is social media sharing.  Preferably through a website, as that leaves a permanent trail of page rank and equity (I'm not just saying this because I happen to sell websites--I sell websites because it happens to be true!)  Next big thing is building a mailing list and engaging with them on an ongoing basis.  Sending interesting and relevant things that build a relationship with your customers.  Third big thing is the blog circuit.  Getting bloggers, vloggers and podcasters to talk about you is easy money and easy credibility.  Pitch them, and make the pitch count.  I wrote a very basic blog post to help Twitter Noobs from Etsy get their feet wet without getting frustrated.  Find it here.  http://beeswaxwebsites.com/blog/4089      hopefully it will be helpful to you.  It's pretty basic stuff, but you'd be surprised how many Etsy sellers don't do these basic things."

Etsy,3dnp28,vintagekaren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"I also agree on putting a lot of effort into pinterest and facebook.  The reason you want to do this is because there is sooooo much competition in the clothing niche that it's very difficult to even be seen from the massive amount of other shops. Find a niche outlet through social media and promote your clothing there. Don't focus on broad products, focus on targeted products and build around that.    EXAMPLE LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/218772045/mens-space-shuttle-launch-tshirt-in  You could target space/NASA/space x/galaxy or other ETC facebook groups and pinterest boards.  I don't think the tags are that good.  ""Clothing"", ""shirts"", ""ETC singular massive competition tags"". Yes it's clothing/a shirt, but that's damn near impossible to rank high when someone searches for clothing/a shirt. Seems like a waste of a tag(s) that you might never reach the top for. It would be nice if you could drill down and see which of your tags drew the highest amount of visits.  techno, rave? Why not ecstasy? You never know.  What I would do and I hope this is allowed. Create another shirt/listing w/ a slight title/tag variation.  Use different titles/tags in each listing and see which shirt brings in more sales. You don't have to put ""in stock"" in the title. This shouldn't give someone an incentive to click. If anything it should be obvious that it's ""in stock"" since you're selling it and the listing popped up. Seems like a waste of word, but if you think it helps then go for it.  I also listed titles in the examples, but left out stuff after ""SHIRT"". You might figure out ETSY's policy on keyword stuffing titles, if they even have one or care. Seems like the customer might have more of an issue. As long as it doesn't look spammy. You can continue adding words behind all this.  You could also blend them in w/ the title: ""TITLE: Men's NASA Space Shuttle ASTRONAUT Launch SCIENCE SHIRT"".  EXAMPLE 1: NASA Shuttle Shirt #1 TITLE: Men's NASA Space Shuttle Launch SHIRT TAGS: ""MENS SHIRT"" / ""NASA"" / ""SPACE"" / ""SPACE SHUTTLE"" / ""SPACE X"" / ""ELON MUSK"" / ""SCIENCE"" / ""GALAXY"" / ""ASTRONOMY SHIRT"" / ""GEEK"" / ""NERD"" / ""NEBULA"" / ""ROCKET SHIRT""  EXAMPLE 2: NASA Shuttle Shirt #2 TITLE: Men's NASA Space Rocket Launch SHIRT TAGS: ""MENS CLOTHING"" / ""NASA SHIRT"" / ""SPACE SHIRT"" / ""ASTRONAUT"" / ""SCIENCE SHIRT"" / ""GALAXIES"" / ""ASTRONOMY"" / ""GEEK SHIRT"" / ""NERD SHIRT"" / ""NEBULA SHIRT"" / ""EARTH SHIRT"" / ""INSPIRATIONAL SHIRT"" / ""AIRCRAFT SHIRT""   ""Shirt"" will still pull up for ""t shirt"", but ""tshirt"" and ""t shirt"" output different results. So you might try the variations of ""shirt"", like ""t shirt"" and ""tshirt"".  You could double up on keywords/tags that you think might perform better, EXAMPLE: ""NASA SHIRT"" / ""NASA T SHIRT"" / ""NASA TSHIRT"". These will all spit out different results. There are also the variations of words, like ""NERD"" and ""NERDY"".  The reason ""galaxies"" / ""galaxy"" (also the same for ""ASTRONAUT"") is used without ""shirt"" @ the end of it is due to those terms maybe not having much results. Therefore you probably being able to reach the top spots w/ only the basic root word, rather than the full word.  That's why I deliberately left ""shirt"" out of it. You might add ""shirt"" &/or ""t shirt"" / ""tshirt"" @ the end and end up w/ a goldmine of a tag/keyword that brings in a lot of sales.  Just make sure to vary the tags from listing to listing. It's a gamble though. I think marmalead let's you know which tags actually perform the best. Rather then having to do all this experiment crap.  IF you sold 100 shirts of shirt #2 within a month and only 30 for shirt #1. It would be nice to see which keywords brought in sales for shirt #1 so you can add them to shirt #2 so you can create a mega seller, but ETSY isn't that friendly.  How did you come up w/ your pricing? Are the margins really high? Have you thought of dropping it just a tad to see if sales increase?  Also, why did you link the ""CA"" Canadian url format""? That might throw someone off to the point where they don't click it. People on ETSY know that the site will automatically convert the currency based on their IP location, but someone not familiar w/ ETSY might think it's only available to ""CA"" visitors.  I don't care for the shop sections either, but that's just me.  The above is not meant to be taken as a blueprint, then you find out things are worse and come egg/toilet paper my house.  The above is just for you to get an idea of how to think about using keywords/tags differently.  Hopefully all goes well.  /walloftext"

The quality of the items in the store looked really great, but there was no information about the store (whether they handmade it themselves or sourced it, and where they sourced it from.)  There was no about page and I messaged the seller asking if they made it themselves, but got  no reply.   Even though Etsy changed their reselling policy, this makes it really difficult for people who really handmake things to compete in terms of pricing and even getting found by potential buyers among the sea of resold goods.  I'm still in the beginning phase of figuring out SEO.  I agree with Mattsy kun- you can usually check from their about page whether or not they make it themselves. Also, if they have an instagram account, you can usually tell if they are really handmaking things as they tend to post pictures of the process."

This way you give the customer some sense of comfort that what they're buying is handmade and that you're not out to screw them if for whatever reason they think you're products look shady in regards to being handmade.  You can even combine multiple images into one, like a collage. Just have to be careful and not give too much of the process out and have someone repeat your DIY process and try to take over for that product."

On etsy if they shit you down because of trademark or copyright issues that's it. You will not have an etsy shop at all forever. You can't open a new one.  If your business is based only on recreating popular characters, imho you may want to rethink your business. Or look into liscening."
Etsy,3dk94q,figment81,8,Fri Jul 17 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I actually just had a Trademark Infringement sent to me via Etsy that was filed by Instagram. I make wedding signs... and a popular style is one that uses a #Hashtag that represents photos from your wedding. You put the sign up at your wedding, and friends & family can share their photos of your fun-filled day/night. While it's extremely popular now (out of the tons that are similar on Etsy), Instagram picked mine specifically to report. Etsy immediately took my listing down and said I had to change it before reposting / or just not repost it at all. Within that same hour, there were pages and pages of other designs similar that were infringing more than myself. It's like running a stop sign. Everyone does it, but you might be the one that DOES get caught & that gets a ticket for it.  I altered my design, and reposted. I actually even spoke to Instagram via email and they were really chill about it. They said mainly not to use ""instagram"" in the title of my listing as people can be led to believe Instagram made the sign or supports the sign. Be careful! I literally had the listing up for only a couple days before they found it."
Etsy,3dk94q,aycockdesigns,5,Fri Jul 17 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Etsy doesn't do anything actively about copyright infringement, but if the copyright holder finds your shop and reports it, your listings will be removed and your shop may be closed. You may also be open to getting sued for damages if the copyright holder registered their work and feels like going after you.  If you don't want to get sued, then don't sell any infringing material. Or ask for a license from the copyright holder."
Etsy,3dk94q,sneaky_dragon,2,Thu Jul 16 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"Catching copyright infringement overall is technically not Etsy's place. They could create tools to catch certain things if the copyright or trademark holder's companies asked but since some people legally license things they wouldn't want to auto kill anything and be accused of shutting shops down invalidly and prohibiting commerce. Reporting violations is the responsibility of the owner of the mark or piece.   Companies generally hire outside companies and counsel to police trademarks and no one really knows what method they use. Sometimes, especially with large properties like movie studios, comic books or Microsoft one day all the items related to one character will just disappear, thousands of them. Sometimes you'll get a take down notice and 800 other things that are exactly the same remain.  Regardless, legally, it's your responsibility to not sell an item nor appear in the marketplace as if you represent the company that owns said copyright or trademarked item. This is something you need to know before you start your business. Also, it is the best path to success. When you're using someone else's ideas and artwork then there's a ceiling already set that you will reach and never grow past. You'll never get beyond Etsy, some conventions and maybe a few local boutiques. You'll never get to experience your own characters being licensed, or bigger stores with purchase orders asking to carry your goods in multiple stores because you can't get big or penetrate a market already handled by true licensees who can mass manufacture items.  Be glad you learned now. Check out the videos linked in the sidebar, and come up with some new ideas that are all your own. Keep a little notebook and every day try something and eventually find something you like that you want to keep improving on, something you'll be proud of making."
Etsy,3dk94q,courtneyj,2,Fri Jul 17 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"""Fan art"" is okay because it's not for sale. The minute you're profiting from it it becomes copyright infringement. There are tons of people doing it on Etsy and tons of people getting away with it, but you always run the risk of getting shut down. You can get your entire shop shut down and run the risk of never being able to open another shop again. Also the copyright holder could sue you.   Never use ""what other shops are doing"" as a way to justify what you're doing."
Etsy,3dk94q,StitchyFox,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:46 2015 UTC,This is a common misconception. It can still be infringing even if it's not for sale.
Etsy,3dk94q,pixelkrafter,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"According to financial docs filed recently as a result of Etsy stock going public we now know that Etsy shuttered 160,000 shops in the last quarter for TOS violations.  Some of those will have been for selling non-handmade work as handmade (looking at you china), while quite a few were certainly as a result of copyright violations.  The simple truth is that you have chosen to create works that are based on work owned by others, and selling it is the problem.  Fan art created for fans by fans with out attempting to make money is no problem at all, but the moment you attempt to make money off it then you are riding on the coattails of a designer that can decide to shake you loose with a lawsuit anytime it suits them to do so, and assuming you lack deep pockets, you will almost certainly lose (likely by simply being forced to remove the content due to the threat of a lawsuit you can not afford... their favorite tactic).    My honest advice to you is to develop your own voice creating your own designs.  However if you do try to keep making money on fan art type work, make damn well sure you are adding something original and not copy/pasting, and never under any circumstances use keywords directly associated with trademarked content (never, ever, ever use Disney based keywords in particular... they have short leash lawyers hunting for infringement)."
Etsy,3dk94q,woodeye,2,Fri Jul 17 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"I believe it was something like 4,000 shops that were shuttered for intellectual property takedown requests.  None the less if it is licensed, either pay for the appropriate license or I would steer clear. You could come up with your own characters! And like others have said, never ever take on Disney."
Etsy,3dk94q,pigandpeacock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm an idiot on this issue, but if the original work/piece isn't of your own creation, then you're on illegal grounds I assume.  When you say fan art, you mean others creations? Or do you just mean that you're a fan of something and you create art surrounding that niche/topic/character/ETC. If other fans are making creations and you're pocketing based off that, then that's like a 2 birds issue.  You would have to take it up w/ the copyright holder or just wait until you get a more educated response. You might try ETSY forums and make a post w/ a more in-depth structure of your business and see what response you get. There are a lot of people that get away w/ this, but that doesn't mean that because they get away w/ it, that you should partake in a slaughter/takedown that could take place.  PS: Don't target disney. They're notorious for getting shops shut down: https://www.etsy.com/teams/7722/discussions/discuss/15084283/  I think it's more about characters, rather than themes of stuff. Like for instance you may get your butt handed to you for creating a stuffed animal character of a movie and be okay if you made a piece of jewelry or dress that portrays what a character wore in it. I could be wrong though."
Etsy,3dk94q,PawedUp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I first opened my shop I didn't realize that it was illegal. I was selling Harry Potter house themed felt owl plushes. They were very popular and then I started reading more into copyright infringement and I no longer sell them. It sucks because people can make really cool things based off something you love but its illegal so its frowned upon. So many people do it, and even really popular shops still haven't been shut down. For example, there is a clothing shop on etsy that sells only clothing related to game of thrones, harry potter, Lord of the Rings, etc and has over 10,000+ sales which is a lot on etsy. Etsy just doesn't care. It's the companies who care so its basically just goes on if they catch you or not."

Etsy,3dk94q,SamOldman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:32 2015 UTC,I wonder why no one ever mentions or seriously discusses fair use or transformative or parody when this topic comes up. Those terms exist for a reason right?
Etsy,3dk94q,pixelkrafter,3,Fri Jul 17 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"parody has to be just that - a parody. And that decision has to be determined by the court. So one can parody something, but the copyright holder can still take them to court and the judge will decide who is in the right or wrong.  Transformative is also in a similar vein - it gets decided in court."
Etsy,3dk94q,figment81,0,Fri Jul 17 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. But it IS possible. Most discussions I've seen don't even note the difference though (including this one). And it remains a legal grey area because it is often not tested in court. It will probably always remain a grey area because it will never be tested frequently enough for there to be any precedents or further narrowing of the definition by the system. Unfortunately.  So, the notion is always, ""if it invokes the mere idea of Batman, you're screwed"". Which frankly sucks."
Etsy,3dk94q,pixelkrafter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the trademark part of things. If you draw say a shadowy figure on a rooftop with a cape that's totally cool. The minute that figure has a yellow bat on his chest or cape. You are profiting off a trademark and yeah... If batman wants to get pissy they will.  Now if you draw a shadowy figure with a cape and it doesn't look like batman meaning no trademarked bat on it you might be just fine.... Unless you say anywhere the word batman. You use batman in a keyword. Nope. Trouble.  Same is true for anything. You have a really cool vintage dress that is right out of the world of don draper. Good for you, call it mid century modern but don't tag it mad men because it's trademarked and you are not affiliated with the show.  If you look at the op's shop there really isn't any fine line here that she is walking. They are illustrated characters that look exactly like the characters jut in pixel format. There is no transformative work, there is no parody, there is no social commentary.  Even with parody it's up to a court to decide, and what one may consider parody could in some cases be considered brand dilution or infringement of trade dress.  There is a great blog on some copyright and trademark cases that are really informative and interesting if you want to see how more things play out in real life http://www.vegastrademarkattorney.com"
Etsy,3dk94q,figment81,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"No, I'm really not. You stated a few obvious examples of trademark; names and symbols. I'm talking about copyright, the idea of a character being invoked by a transformative work or a parody. It's been done, and safely. And it should be ABLE to be done, imo.   Lots of people like to boil it down to black and white for simplicity's sake, but there's nothing simple about it: the law implies fair use but never explicitly defines it. There's not enough case precedent to further define the meaning. There probably never will be. So we're left with endless discussion where people spout ""rules"" and interpretation back and forth that are untrue, because it's a deliberately vague subject. That's the situation we're in and that's what I think sucks."
Etsy,3dk94q,pixelkrafter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"If one wants to parody a character, they can feel free to do it. It may result in a DMCA file from the property holder, which you can file a counter claim. At that point the property holder can decide to take the situation to court. It will then be up to the judge to determine based on evidence and past cases of the work qualifies as parody ( or satire which is often a harder sell).  The artist may feel like it's parody, but they are not the decision maker.  Fair use is often cited when the work in question is being used for the greater good of society much like news or text books. A very famous case of this was time magazine, who purchased the rights to the JFK assignation video, and tried to keep it from airing anywhere else. The courts decided that any news outlet had the right to air the video because of the fair use clause."
Etsy,3dk94q,figment81,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:28:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. Only a judge can make a decision on whether it is fair use or not.   It does seem to me that different arts are treated differently too. Music, for example, seems easier to sample than illustrated works of art. I mean, there are tested commercial cases with whole lifted samplings of the original artist's recording (not even reproductions) incorporated into a rap song that have passed the fair use test. Mirror that with a fan's chibi stylings of the Avengers though, and all of the sudden the guy is a scumbag."
Etsy,3dk94q,pixelkrafter,0,Sat Jul 18 18:50:57 2015 UTC,"You might be really surprised to learn that most of those samples were paid for, either  before or after use. It is just kept more quiet, and most artists/producers have a contract clause that states they have received music clearances from the copyright holder. Music copyright and royalties are even more complicated than comic character trademark and copyright, however, in most cases, those samples are paid for, and paid for very well. (No one samples a crappy song, lol.)   Some artists sample the work of other artists on the same label, so if the label owns the copyright, (which they usually do, at least for a period of time) they can basically clear the way for sampling, even if the sampled artist objects.   As I said, this is WAY simplified, but it is also a big issue.  For example, Donald Trump used a Neil Young song when he announced his run for president. As it was broadcast over networks, Trump needed permission. Young was VERY angry that his song was used. (Young was performer and songwriter, which is important, and he dislikes Trump) Not sure what happened, monetarily, but Trump is not using that song anymore. His use was NOT fair use, and he did not have permission. Trump was really stupid to do that, too. He (or his handlers) should know better."

Etsy,3dk2w3,briekachu,3,Thu Jul 16 22:44:21 2015 UTC,"It's wise to use mockups, even if you have physical prints.  For one, they protect your work (especially at a slight angle) from unauthorized downloads and piracy.  It's incredibly easy to steal unmocked-up images from Etsy.  I've never done this for personal gain, but I have done it just to see how dangerous it is to post an unmocked-up image on Etsy (it's very dangerous, don't do it!!!!).  Mockups help you not get stolen by Alibaba.  MOCKUPS HELP YOU NOT GET STOLEN BY ALIBABA  Everyone dealing in digital graphics should be using mockups as protection.  I cannot overstate this.  It's imperative.  Additionally, mockups show your work in the best possible light, literally.  It's a lot easier to mock up an image digitally than it is to find an appropriate empty wall with good lighting, photograph them well, and edit that photo so it looks good.  All digital artists should be using Mockups.  Mockups are often free.  They're easy.  Use the dang things."

Etsy,3dj20r,figment81,5,Thu Jul 16 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"Sample requests for hard goods are usually people looking to get free stuff unless you are selling supplies where the customer needs to very color/texture/style/usability.  Here is what I do. If I believe the request might be legit, I will offer to sell the sample to them at a discount (even at cost). Then, if it is a fit, I will apply the amount they paid for the sample to the final large purchase.  This method compensates you for the sample if the big deal does not go through but still gives the customer an incentive to complete the final sale.   Businesses that make large, bulk purchases understand things are not free. They don't mind paying to purchase a finished product. It is only fair.  If your customer does not agree, then you know they were either fishing for free stuff or would be an unreasonable buyer that would likely not be worth it in the end."

Most places require sample purchases before a discounted bulk. I don't see why any legit customer/business would have an argument w/ this.  Do you think they're making a reseller purchase? Or is it something like, ""oh I need a shirt for everyday of the week"", and they're just purchasing solely for themselves or their household/small group."

Etsy,3djrpn,meow_gusta,8,Thu Jul 16 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"A copyright or trademark owner can file a DMCA claim with any company, such as Etsy, hosting infringing material. Upon receipt of the claim, the company must remove the material.  So, those stores that are selling such merchandise are likely doing it illegally (in that they are violating intellectual property laws) but have not yet been shut down. Etsy can take down those stores on its own, or it can wait until it receives a DMCA takedown notice to do so.  Further, the IP owners can sue the owners of the stores selling infringing property regardless of what Etsy does. Damages for infringing items can be significant, and don't have to be based solely on the value of the item. I think statutory damages can be between $250 and $30,0000 per item. This means that if someone sues you for infringement and you lose, you'll have a judgment against you for a lot of money.

Aside from the fact that they feel it's a ""grey area"" since they're putting their own spin on it... the reason why some people feel like they can get away with referencing copyrighted things is because SOME companies openly state that they're going to turn a blind eye. If you go to a convention, you can see heaps of people selling various forms of fan art. It would be easy pickings to tear these people down. But some companies realize that it greatly helps them keep their fanbases alive so they don't outright say ""GO WILD!""... but they also won't say ""don't you dare"". Disney/Marvel are examples of companies that absolutely say ""don't you dare"".   Example: Here's a press statement from Funimation. This is the company who handles the North American IP of Dragon Ball Z, One Piece and some other animes that I can't recall at the moment. It's just from a few days ago and it's been very publicized over the news for being so ground breaking because it's being very clear about how they feel about selling fan art:      ""Despite Funimation's legal stance on this issue [fan art + copyright infringement], Funimation appreciates the entertainment, education and skill that goes into and arises from the imitation and creation of works derived from existing works of popular manga and anime. Funimation likewise realizes that the “Artist Alley” area of most conventions can be a good showcase for these works and therefore Funimation tends not to enforce its copyright rights against those in Artist Alley who may be infringing Funimation's copyright rights. Funimation's trademark rights, on the other hand, cannot go unenforced. This stems from a key distinction between U.S. Copyright Law and U.S. Trademark Law—in short, if copyright rights are not enforced, the copyright stays intact and the copyright holder generally will not suffer any harm beyond the infringement itself. But if trademark rights are not enforced, the trademark can be cancelled. ""      You can read the rest of the press statement if you want but yeah, they say STAY AWAY from their TRADEMARK (symbols/logos) or they WILL come for you because they have to, by law. Like what kind of company says ""JUST SO YOU KNOW, we probably won't enforce the copyright. But you gotta stay away from the trademark"". They even tossed in a subtle ""great work on the fan art btw"". They could just issue a release saying they're serious about enforcing their copyright and trademark, this is what Disney/Marvel do. It's not because this didn't occur to them, it was entirely intentional. They're not giving you a green light to profit off of someone else's IP. They'll never say yes. It's never okay to use someone else's IP. They're just pointing out they're not going to bother unless you poke their trademark... they're probably going to turn a blind eye. Probably. They can throw down the hammer whenever they please still.   Parody is also protected under ""fair use"" laws. There was a famous case using an advertisement and everything - parody for profit. Again, very grey area, you don't want to go there.   So yeah, this is the kind of thing that makes people think they can get away with it. People who don't see in black and white/have a poor moral compass see this as a green light and hence Etsy copyright infringement left, right and center. I'm not endorsing it, I'm just showing the other side.   It's never okay to profit from other people's IP. Morally speaking, you should stay away, absolutely. YOU would hate someone referencing your product without some sort of agreement between the two of you. But yes, that's why some people feel like they can get away from it. The ones that imply they're going to turn a blind eye can change their mind at any second. It's not a good strategy."

How would you feel if you spent almost a century building up public goodwill, name and brand recognition, and love for a creative work that you came up with only to have some joker show up and start spewing out products that you : 1) Have no quality control over. 2) Are not getting paid for. and 3) May not agree with.  All those decades of hard work can get flushed down the toilet when some stupid spaz creates a ""Mickey Mouse Straight Razor for Kids"" and little Timmy cuts his pecker off with it.  The news won't say ""an unauthorized bootleg"" - they will just say ""MICKEY MOUSE TOY CUT TODDLERS PENIS OFF"" and boom ... damage done.

You have spent $0, and you think it's fair to ride on their coattails. It's not fair to their brand it's also not fair to the rest of us who are working hard to develop our own brands while you get the luxury of selling off someone else's hard work.  On Etsy they do not remove anything until a request is issued from the copyright holder, and as far as I know they do keep up with that, unlike removing their top selling alibaba resellers. So you can't say, ""BUT others are doing it"" because it's not Etsys responsibility to police infringers."

Etsy,3dg55b,figment81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"It really depends more on the product/niche I think.  If you've done everything by the book before on ETSY (tags/SEO/promotion/ETC) and you still had very little sales, do you think that energy could had been better used for your own website?  How are you current sales now compared to how they were on ETSY? How long has it been since you promoted your product(s) on ETSY? ETSY has really blown up since the past few years. So I'm sure your target market has much more potential customers.  I would give it a run and see how things go for a few months, then gauge your output/sales vs each selling platform (ETSY vs your website). You should be spending your energy on the best sales performers.  I agree that you shouldn't have all your eggs in one basket. I do believe though that some eggs are rotten and you must discard them. As said, you must be consistent on each platform to gauge which is the better performer. Even though, if both perform well then just make sure that you have a system in place to deal w/ both of them or other ETC selling platforms. You don't want to end up stressed or insane.  You did good though w/ having your own website first, then gauging greener pastures. Some people on ETSY don't even have their own website or backup plan when ETSY throws shit fit and closes their shop for whatever reason. Granted, most shops are not infringing on any copyrights or against an ETSY policy, but it's a scary thought that @ the end of the day you're just a button press away from getting the rug pulled out from your feet."

Because of the vagaries of the Etsy search engine, the more favorites you get, the more sales you're likely to have.  Your task is to convert those views, whether through favorites (less valuable), or directly to sales (extremely valuable).    The best way to get views in the nearterm is through social media sharing.  The best way to convert is by having your keywords and tags closely aligned to what people are actually looking for by making them very specific.  The 10:1 favorites to sales ratio is pretty reliable (not guaranteed) but you can get a lot of views through haphazard keywording that won't do you any favors.  Concentrate on the long tail (multi-word tags), and increase your social media profile to get the best efficiency here."
Etsy,3dgfqp,skunkhaus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:12:52 2015 UTC,Opened up shop on 3/25 and have slightly under a 43:1 ratio of views to orders.  This month so far I'm operating on a 26:1 ratio.
Etsy,3dedx9,oxosmooches,11,Wed Jul 15 16:51:24 2015 UTC,Etsy's standpoint is that it is spam.   My standpoint is that it is spam. I generally don't want that type of email coming into my inbox.
Etsy,3dedx9,locustandplum,-7,Wed Jul 15 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"I would like to see the policy write up on it being spam.  I think people would be excited or maybe that feeling people get when they feel like a company cares or that they haven't been forgotten as being a customer or favoriter.  I think if you're pissed about it, then it's probably not your ""favorite"" shop and you should stop favoriting shit you don't favorite. At least understand the meaning behind the word favorite before you take part in taking an action w/ that word based around it."
Etsy,3dedx9,PawedUp,5,Wed Jul 15 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"HERE  ""Spam is unsolicited marketing or other messages intended to benefit the sender"""
Etsy,3dedx9,RogueVenus,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that.  That pissed was meant for someone else. Either way, displeased/not wanting it, whatever the feeling, my original argument still stands.  It does give permission though. The only purpose of favorites would be to see new product updates via the ETSY homepage.  http://i.imgur.com/sd6TijE.jpg  Don't participate in the favorite system or just turn off those notifications. If someone still wants homepage updates, then they would still get them.  If it's a problem for customers, then they should just make it an ETSY only thing and just not allow this type of marketing to ever reach your email via ETSY.  I hate spam like everyone else, so maybe they should popup that you're actually opting in to a promotion queue or something."
Etsy,3dedx9,PawedUp,6,Wed Jul 15 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"The only purpose of favorites would be to see new product updates via the ETSY homepage.   I disagree. I favorite items when I might want to buy them later, or want to come back to them to compare them with another similar item. I favorite shops when they have multiple items that I might want to buy/compare, rather than favoriting each individual item.  When I have the time/money, I pull up my favorites and look through to see what I might want to order  If you want to have a giveaway, I think social media is more appropriate. If I want to see stuff like giveaways, coupons, etc, I look for a Facebook or Twitter link (I wish Etsy had a link to connect to Instagram)"

I need a coffee or a nap.  I think that ETSY is the more viable place where giveaways should be. Appropriate I guess is for others to decide. Social media can gain a lot of steam though. You might have only 30 shop favorites, which doesn't give you very many people to target. Social media on the other hand has no real limits, especially since they involve sharing/pinning to others. Not sure why instagram isn't in bed w/ ETSY. Might be a guideline issue in instagram for product promotions."
Etsy,3dedx9,PawedUp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"Also, would like to point out that I don't fully 100% agree that just because you're opted in to that email system, doesn't mean that it's still not spam.  I look @ it from a frequency position.  SHOP A: Issues a coupon code for the holidays that's 20% OFF (or something along those lines) and usually only does this for special occasions.  SHOP B: Issues coupon codes monthly or weekly @ a certain % OFF. SHOP B marks up their prices 10% and issues coupon codes frequently under the guise that the customer is getting a 'good deal', when they're actually paying the same price. A method that is only used just to get inside the potential customers/customers email box.  There are many ways to look @ it. There are good/bad ways it can be used, but if someone is under the position that all is bad, then I guess it doesn't matter either way which method is used. Not sure how a better system could be constructed to combat to combat the bad shops. I guess just reporting them to ETSY that the messages from them are too frequent."
Etsy,3dedx9,PawedUp,3,Wed Jul 15 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Where did I say I'd be ""pissed""?   As far as I know, ""favoriting"" an item doesn't give the shop permission to contact you.

I would like an email that I was automatically entered into a giveaway for an item I favorited (or better yet, that I was automatically entered and won!)

I dislike how we sellers are made to feel obligated to cater to people with unrealistic expectations just for the sake of a good review.   Honestly this is bad policy, it shouldn't factor into a decision on something like this. It's not your job to restore balance to the world and punish stupid people, it's your job to make money and get customers.  In the end it's about whether serving this person will help OP do that better or worse."
Etsy,3dc1om,mollyjoon,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider it bad policy. It's fair policy. Saying no to the customer doesn't need to be conveyed to the customer in a way that makes them sound ""stupid.""  What would be bad is delaying the orders of the customers who did leave enough time for making/shipping, in favor of the one who didn't.  It depends on the seller (or on OP in this case.) I'm busy enough that I'm not able to take rush orders at all, because they screw up my schedule, and I can afford to cancel a sale or two here and there."
Etsy,3dc1om,mollyjoon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:11:53 2015 UTC,"true, if someone sends me a message voicing their concerns, i put customer service first. even if it does go against my policy. it's best to have the sell and positive review. stressing out about getting orders out in time is my life, that's just how the handmade business works.   *this is only a night-time 'job' for me, but hoping to be full-time within the next couple of years."
Etsy,3ddm0o,AVERAGEJ0ES,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:16 2015 UTC,Are you concerned about losing return customers?  Are you asking how it works?  What info are you looking for?
Etsy,3ddm0o,mollyjoon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"Just wondering if it proved beneficial to shops that have changed their name.   Here's my personal pro's and con's:  Pro:  --Increased SEO  --More fluent branding (from boxes, cards, to just remembering the name)  --I've moved, and having my shop named after a town I don't live in isn't really relevant   Con:  --Costly domain name change (for own website)  --One of my top 10 searched terms is my business name"
Etsy,3ddm0o,Christypaints,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"Well, as the business started in whichever place you started it, it's still relevant in that way. Its your roots! I would worry about changing my name, but I'm still a baby shop, and it seems like that would mean a lot of money/work ahead to make sure all my ""old"" customers could still find me.  That being said, I don't have the actual experience of doing this. Just my .02"
Etsy,3ddm0o,PawedUp,2,Wed Jul 15 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter too much I think. Unless you have customers searching your shop name into google/ETSY to pull back results.  What does ETSY do when they let you change your name?  Does the shop URL redirect to the new name? If not, you lose all your listings. If I found a link to your product on pinterest and click through to it, I get taken to a page that it either no longer exists, or a similar product results page. If that was a sell, you've just lost it.  The domain name change shouldn't be costly, unless you're purchasing a auctioned domain. It's only $10 or so dollars and you just 301 the old domain to the new, then change any instance of the old name to the new name within the template. Maybe even make a blog post stating the name change and the reasons, so that old customers on your website don't think you've sold the business or got hacked.  I've moved, and having my shop named after a town I don't live in isn't really relevant >   That itself is also part of branding, differentiation. Not sure why that's even an issue as it doesn't seem you have a local business."
Etsy,3ddm0o,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Wed Jul 15 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"Your old etsy store link does reroute to your new etsy shop name. I changed mine close to 1.5 years ago, and I just tried it. My name wasn't doing what I wanted, and I have no regrets in switching! :)"
Etsy,3ddm0o,GoodVyybes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"I did. I started out selling mostly vintage flannels and sweaters, so last year my store's name was CozyWhiskers. As I started putting up more customizable jewelry, I realized that's what I should be focused more on. I knew CozyWhiskers didn't make since for mainly a jewelry store, so I changed the store's name to VYYBES in April. I've probably actually gotten an increase in sales, I'm not sure if the name change had anything to do with it but I spent a lot of time making a logo to go along with my new name, so that could definitely be a factor too. When I changed it, I basically just printed an extra note on the back of the packing slips I put in packages letting my customers know about the name change about a month in advance. So unless your product and name don't match at all, I don't think changing it should impact your sales."
Etsy,3ddm0o,thejoyouknow,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:00 2015 UTC,(CozyWiskers is/was a fantastic name for a flannel/sweater shop...)
Etsy,3ddm0o,mayhaps,2,Wed Jul 15 23:34:31 2015 UTC,That's a great idea about letting people know of the name change. Thank you!
Etsy,3ddm0o,swxw,2,Thu Jul 16 04:06:15 2015 UTC,"i don't have a very established shop, but i changed my name recently. when i search etsy for people/shops with my old shop name, it still pulls up my shop. you can also put your old shop name in your item tags."
Etsy,3dedgh,ArdhaChandrasana,4,Wed Jul 15 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"I would add it as a listing variation, but make sure that at least one of your photos shows the safety eyes on a finished product."
Etsy,3dedgh,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:52 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Make sure you are as clear as possible in the item description explaining the two differences.
Etsy,3dedgh,locustandplum,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:20 2015 UTC,I would just switch to the safety eyes and have done with it if most of your orders are for children. Why ask for trouble when we all know customers aren't...always very bright...
Etsy,3dedgh,5bi5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:37:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I have had so many people ask me if they are child tested and I say for playing yes but not for kids that chew on things? It's too ambiguous so I might just have to change and avoid the headache
Etsy,3dedgh,Christypaints,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:48:01 2015 UTC,I would make it a variation but be REALLY clear in your descriptions and photos the differences
Etsy,3dedgh,pi_prints,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:14:53 2015 UTC,Depending on how many items you have in your shop I would make it a separate listing and have links to the other variation in the description. This way your shop would look like it has a larger selection but if you already have a lot of items listed just add it as a variations like the others suggested.
Etsy,3dedgh,thejoyouknow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:53 2015 UTC,This one makes most sense to me - even if there are a number of things in the shop.  Wouldn't the extra tagging and item recognition be worth it?  Essentially you have two things: one version that is suitable for everyone and another that is suitable for a certain age group and older...
Etsy,3dedgh,pigandpeacock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"You could add it as a variation, or set up a second listing. The one with safety eyes would specifically call it out for children under 3 or something to that effect. It will also give you more listings. Then in your felted eye listing you could link to the same item (or shop section) for the safety eye ones."
Etsy,3de1z8,BrokeAssBuilder,2,Wed Jul 15 15:23:46 2015 UTC,I would give it a try. Keep your single item listings but make another listing with all 3 together and link to it in the single item descriptions and vise versa. Since they aren't selling anyway some money for stuff you put effort in is better than no money at all.
Etsy,3de1z8,pi_prints,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:23 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea! Save money and don't have three listings when you can have one.  :)
Etsy,3de1z8,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:50:20 2015 UTC,What is your usual workflow for renewing those items? Do you have any thoughts as to why they don't sell as well as your other items?
Etsy,3de1z8,thejoyouknow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it is they are too specific. I might have 10 templates in a mint green with a floral border all set at $6.00 (table numbers, programs, program fans, invitations, save the dates, response card, menu, bar sign, DIY signs, Escort Cards, Gift tags, Straw labels, Cupcake labels, etc.) but only one or two will sell. Then I renew them, one or two different ones will sell. So the color might be popular, but it costs almost $2.00 every month and it's a massive process setting up that many listings when I want to intro a new lineup"
Etsy,3d9hfl,erinalexa,26,Tue Jul 14 15:29:21 2015 UTC,Bring it.  All that factory made stuff brings etsy way down.
Etsy,3d9hfl,tom8o,9,Tue Jul 14 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just try searching for ""skull pendant"" and seeing which ones are actually handmade. It's kind of tricky to drill down since there is a cheap Chinese knockoff of something that fits almost any search word you put in."
Etsy,3d9hfl,WiretapStudios,5,Tue Jul 14 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"I wish that etsy had some serious upgrades to search capacities. Right now it is nearly impossible to get meaningful search results.  I think a lot could be solved with one simple option - let people search by country of origin.  If a seller is in the U.S. and the goods are from overseas I don't want anything to do with that.  I just don't think that etsy really cares about being artisan and handmade anymore.  They sold their soul a long time ago and as it's ""their marketplace"" and ""their forums"" any truth is redacted any complaints ignored.  We have to have a non-etsy community with non-etsy tied usernames to be halfway honest.  But even here - many people cross link back to Etsy for the hope that somehow it will increase sales.  At they are real people.  And I've come to love this group."
Etsy,3d9hfl,tom8o,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:18:59 2015 UTC,Etsy does accept factory made 'skull pendants' as it is a supply for making jewelry.
Etsy,3d9hfl,Caramelpaper,2,Wed Jul 15 04:56:28 2015 UTC,"I know, that's part of the problem. Cheap Chinese metal pieces listed by the thousands dilute finding something unique and handmade. It should be in a separate section of Etsy and not in the main search results."
Etsy,3d9hfl,WiretapStudios,2,Wed Jul 15 05:32:25 2015 UTC,"There is already a way to separate handmade from non-handmade on etsy. There's also nothing wrong with selling factory made supplies on etsy and it has every right to be on the main search results. A good portion of sellers who grew Etsy to what it is sell wholesale/commercial beads, charms, chains, and other supplies. A lot of people who make custom jewelry to sell also buy from these people. It would be unfair to lower these people's shops from the search results."
Etsy,3d9hfl,Caramelpaper,2,Wed Jul 15 06:27:37 2015 UTC,"Which way can you separate them? Is there a checkbox for handmade necklaces with pendants that will rule out any pendant supplies? Because every time I've drilled down, they are still there. Also, you realize part of this overall discussion is that there are hundreds of thousands of those that are just junk from Chinese resellers right?"
Etsy,3d9hfl,WiretapStudios,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:58:27 2015 UTC,"There might be nothing 'wrong', but that is not the point of the discussion...The point is that those items belong in another platform. It is hardly fair for unique, handmade items to be lost in a sea of mass produced made-in-china products."
Etsy,3d9hfl,astronautas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"There are many supply shops that are local businesses and they have been on Etsy since the beginning. They get their items from China, do you suggest they get booted and told to go on another platform? I remember Etsy does article features on these supply shops time to time and like any business, they have grown because of Etsy and in return, they gave etsy more business. These shop keepers have also supplied many sellers. Because they have grown and become established, they hired many employees. If they get thrown out, that would be a big hit for them. I know this thread is targeting mass produced things but we are also putting a big bullseye on our neighbors who sell supplies on etsy and have been an important members of the etsy community.   If etsy deleted, restricted, deactivated, removed, suspended every single listing that was a commercially made supply like how people want them to do, it would definetely end etsy. People  will hate etsy and sympathize with those who have used etsy as their full time job. It is also something they allowed since the beginning and probably goes against the terms and agreements that they can't suddenly decide to do these to their sellers."
Etsy,3d9hfl,Caramelpaper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sites like this are the problem. https://www.etsy.com/shop/BestSellerSupplies  They are handmade, but hand made by dirt cheap labor in china."

I think supplies should go in a ""supply store"" section of Esty if they want to carry them. I don't walk into a department store and look for handmade shirts in the middle of tens of thousands of stacks of buttons, thread, and material. They are diluting the search results."

Etsy,3d9hfl,pat52210,15,Tue Jul 14 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's that they shut down all the ones with the lowest sales though, sort of a complying without actually losing money type thing."
Etsy,3d9hfl,WiretapStudios,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"The crackdown on non- handmade goods started at the same time as a crackdown on trademark violations, which was instigated by a shareholder lawsuit after their IPO."

Shareholder pressure might actually help clean up Etsy."

Etsy,3d9hfl,Seamstome,5,Tue Jul 14 20:37:35 2015 UTC,I call BS. There's many stores I've personally reported that none of which have been closed.
Etsy,3d9hfl,Orgran,5,Tue Jul 14 19:21:42 2015 UTC,"first transparency report   Bet they're feeling the heat from amazon.  Read the .pdf report, not convinced that easily.  Until I report a shop for reselling and that shop get's shutdown, I will continue to stay in disbelief to them taking actions (which hasn't happened). The only time I seen them take action on a shop is if it got media/viral publicity. Even then, some shops continue to stay open because they make a killing from them and end up getting a policy changed so that they can keep them.  Resell a mass produced product that you didn't design nor create, do a lot of business/commissions for ETSY, claim legitness through whatever means neccessary (oh I purchase this and then add some random flare shit to it), policy gets changed to reflect they're/you're within ETSY's guidelines because the original product was 'handmade' at one time, but is now mass-produced, equals win for you (you become legit and you no longer have to prove handmade) and a win for ETSY/shareholders. Everything thing on the face of this Earth has been handmade at one time (except for natural stuff please don't quote me or do I don't care, I do maybe). Just because you mass produce it doesn't make it still handmade by you. Products in china are handmade by other people and are supplied by designs by people from the West mainly (just pulled that out of my ass, but I'm sure the vast % of products are)."
Etsy,3d9hfl,PawedUp,13,Tue Jul 14 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. When their top selling resellers get taken down, then I'll take their transparency ""efforts"" seriously.   A quick look at Craftcount and two of Etsy's top ""handmade"" sellers are obvious resellers (ThreeBirdNest and PoshPeanut lift their shit from alibaba), and the rest are either personalized knickknacks (generic, soul-less CafePress kind of print services), or printable products."

I would just get a square reader for now.   edit:// or you just enter the card numbers manually until your request with Etsy is processed.
Etsy,3dc7p9,dearerin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would buy the etsy card reader if they would let me buy it. But no.......they have to play all this mystery shit. I tried emailing them too and they keep saying my email address isn't valid even though I use that email address for my shop. I didn't know before that you could enter the card number. I know that could make customers nervous. But thank you briekachu! Ps, I currently have a paypal card reader, but it's only compatible with my ipad."
Etsy,3dc7p9,i_dont_love,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"You can order square online for free. I signed up to receive etsy reader around Christmas, and only couple month ago they sent me an email asking to fill out some more info: what kind of craft fairs I participate, and how often. Last week, they finally sent me an email saying to confirm my order for etsy reader... Sooooo it's a loooong wait. I don't know if it helps, but your local fairs sometime make etsy events that you can rsvp to."
Etsy,3dc7p9,locustandplum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. I skipped the craft fairs this summer b/c I was busy, and not everyone really knows about etsy unless they're addicted to pinterest Lol. I actually had to make another profile on pinterest after quitting that site b/c pinterest addicts are good for marketing, did the same for tumblr."
Etsy,3da3ua,anglophilie,10,Tue Jul 14 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"I designed my own cards and went with vistaprint.  I tip them into all of my etsy and ebay shipments and also designed them to double as packaging: http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r4gAAOSwyQtVmvug/$_58.JPG    It's cool.  I poke holes in them for earrings and cut little notches for necklaces, and its got all of my info on the back."
Etsy,3da3ua,5bi5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing.  I punch little holes in to mine and hang the item so it dangles beneath my logo.  It's an all in one!  :)  I also used VistaPrint with great success.  I have a set made as mentioned above and then a second set with care instructions for my items.  It was easy to create a design, fast turnaround and if you take advantage of the right promo it can be incredibly cheap."
Etsy,3da3ua,HolyTanuki,6,Wed Jul 15 00:25:16 2015 UTC,i designed my business cards and ordered them from moo. the basic card quality is great and you can print different images on each one to show off your products. i included an illustration on one side in the hopes that people would like it enough to keep it.
Etsy,3da3ua,mayhaps,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:58 2015 UTC,Yours are super adorable! I would definitely keep it around for a little while.
Etsy,3da3ua,5bi5,2,Tue Jul 14 19:31:36 2015 UTC,Your cards are so cute! I would put it on my fridge because I like the animal designs so much

They're just not entirely uniform in size since I'm cutting a piece of cardstock one at a time. No one would know since it's not like I give a single person a stack of cards.  I hand-write a thank you on the back when including it in a shipment to a customer :)"
Etsy,3da3ua,Vanetia,3,Tue Jul 14 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"I don't use business cards in my orders, but I did order a ton in preparation for a vendor booth later this year.  I designed my own and ordered them from gotprint.com."

Like u/5bi5 said, I also put them in Etsy + Ebay sales, plus hand them out at fairs, and it's easy to hand it to someone who asks about Etsy in general or about seeing more of your work.    ;)  PS: I went with Vistaprint also."
Etsy,3da3ua,Aphid61,3,Tue Jul 14 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"I have two sets of cards. One that has all my social media links on the front and a thank you note on the back to include with purchases, and then one of similar design that has my links more spread out to pass out to people. I printed mine at zazzle, but I went with a completely custom design. I used a few images my husband took of my store set up and products as the backgrounds with some opacity so you can clearly see the text and then uploaded to zazzle. I think they look great and very professional - especially for the price paid!"
Etsy,3da3ua,SometimesISewThings,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"I do use business cards. Because I buy and sell vintage things, I particularly use them for folks who are considering downsizing some of their stuff. I bought mine off Zazzle...they have about a million designs to choose and frequently have sales on them. They've come in handy for me :)"
Etsy,3da3ua,vintagekaren,2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"I ended up getting two different business cards- one that I send/give out after a purchase that has a coupon code on it and one that has all my social media sites and contact info on it.   I always keep the second one with me in case I'm talking to someone about sewing or my shop, especially since some of the things I sew I use for myself too."
Etsy,3da3ua,cherryfristado,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:21 2015 UTC,I am thinking about ordering a second set of cards with my email/phone number on them for friends/family/people I know personally.

Etsy,3dbkxc,SaqibChowdhry,3,Wed Jul 15 00:21:46 2015 UTC,Hey Saqib my fellow Norcal artist! (:  The only place you can really post your items is in the one weekly post I see you've posted in. After you get a shop set up then you'll start working on advertising and more on social media.   Your items thus far are all copyright infringing. Disney is a defensive company and especially likely to shut you down for using their stuff at some point. Just a heads up if you want all this time you're spending to mean something.  Your next step is to add your items and read the Etsy Seller Handbook (https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook). On all future print I'd recommend finding a nice frame mock up and using that for them. You'll then need to find a better use of keywords (https://marmalead.com/ is very helpful with this). Fill out your welcome message and shop policies.   Are you printing your prints on a high quality printer that you personally own? If not - you'll need to apply for outside manufacturing and get permission from Etsy to sell them (if this is the case you can transition to selling the digital file for printing instead / while you wait).  Once you've got all of these things straightened out then you should post in this forum asking for a shop critique and we'll help you improve on anything that we can. We're also a pretty helpful community so I hope you enjoy your stay.
Etsy,3dbkxc,briekachu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:03:46 2015 UTC,I'm new too. Just started to figure it all out. I have... nearly 0 views but I can tell you that there are some really useful links over on the sidebar. I've read a lot of advice using those links on how to use social media and get your name out there.
Etsy,3dbkxc,therealac,0,Thu Jul 16 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"Hey briekachu!  Firstly, I would like to thank you for your time and help!  Secondly, I completely understand what you're saying about the Disney items, I just needed to populate my shop but I intend to remedy that issue soon.  Thirdly, thanks for the tips about the handbook and marmalead! I will get everything sorted soon and submit my shop for a critique."
Etsy,3d9xry,figment81,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:12 2015 UTC,I wonder what success rate that Etsy will be happy with.
Etsy,3d9xry,locustandplum,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:10 2015 UTC,to continue? - I dont think they will truthfully.  I dont think their hearts were behind it - just their open wallet.

Etsy,3d9nko,GoodVyybes,3,Tue Jul 14 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a twitter junkie so it's never been a problem for me. :)  One thing you can consider is using bufferapp.com for auto-posting.  Unlike other auto-post apps it only posts what and when you tell it to, and it makes sharing pictures/links from other parts of the internet a breeze.  The cheapest account is $10 a month and you can connect 10 different accounts to it.  It supports twitter, facebook, pintrest, linkedin, google +.  The only thing it doesnt do (and I really wish it did) is tumblr & instagram, but I hear they're working on it.  I write ebooks under several names and it makes keeping up with multiple accounts a breeze.  That being said, I am good with twitter and need cash, so if you need hand I'd be happy to give you one."
Etsy,3d9nko,5bi5,2,Tue Jul 14 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"That's a really great idea, that might be what I end up doing (:"
Etsy,3d9nko,ilovemydoodles,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Been looking for an app that can do this, manually keeping up with 4 accounts across all platforms is hurting my brain, not to mention time consuming on a level that i can barely cope with running two businesses, thanks for the reccomendation!"
Etsy,3d9nko,briekachu,3,Fri Jul 17 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to go that far. I think the key is picking a social media outlet or two, rather than trying to go for them all. I use Instagram primarily (I'm working on Pinterest now - and I /have/ a Facebook that I'm not worrying about). Since you're working on your orders on a more daily basis I think Instagram would be good for you since you can post a lot of ""in progress"" shots and get followers that way.   By not trying to be on all platforms you're saving yourself time and also being more effective as you drive good content through the media outlet (since you're not rushing to just post things everywhere)."
Etsy,3d9nko,skunkhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"I thought that too, I mainly only use Instagram right now but I've had my store opened for a little over a year and I'm planning on launching an actual website with my own domain soon. Most legit stores I've seen have accounts on pretty much every social media platform even if they're not super active. But that being said, most stores that are actual brands have more than one person working, so trying to stay on top of all my orders and making my site seem professional is getting a little overwhelming on top of taking new product pictures, posting on Instagram, making new listings, etc. it's just a lot for one person to handle and I'm trying to think of things I need done for my store that I don't have to do myself so I might be able to get some help. I just feel swamped. -.-"
Etsy,3d9nko,Christypaints,2,Tue Jul 14 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I think you can definitely get a lot of bang for your buck from social media, but unless you are either rolling in cash or extremely strapped for time and imagination, a professional marketer is really a big investment for any small/micro business to undertake.  It's an ongoing expense that can easily cost $100/hour or more.  Before going down that road, I'd take a close look at whether some kind of social media marketing automation might not solve the problem you're facing.  I personally use Buffer and IFTTT, and manage my twitter accounts with Crowdfire and ManageFlitter.  I also use Klout (occasionally) and Twitter analytics (often) to check my post reach.    These tools are essentially the same that you'll find in a social media firm, and while it may take you a frustrating minute or two to organize your strategy, it's a very set-it-and-forget-it routine, once the strategy is set.  Best advice I can give for social media is focus most of your efforts on Twitter and Pinterest (better exposure than facebook, and links are clickable, unlike Instagram).  Plan to post 10-20 times/day on Twitter (this can be automated), pin frequently, hashtag on both platforms, and reuse only your best 1-2 posts on Facebook to escape the dreaded ""post reach throttle""  If you really think hiring a pro is worthwhile, I'd encourage you to have them concentrate on promoted facebook contests.  Those have very good ROI, but can be pretty complicated for a non-pro to run."
Etsy,3d8z4o,maria_ivanovna,3,Tue Jul 14 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"I have an item that's been a month in process.  I called the post office to find out what's going on, they said it's still in the sorting facility and there was something wrong with the address.  They are going to send it back to me.  I messaged the customer to tell them and they said they got their item 2 days ago! I'm glad I have such honest customers:) now I will sit back and wait for the post office to send me my item lol"
Etsy,3d8z4o,mandanastudios,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:49 2015 UTC,One time I sent a package and the tracking info didn't update until after the package was delivered. But that was a two-day package. I would contact the buyer.
Etsy,3d8z4o,k80k80k80,4,Tue Jul 14 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking. I'm going to give it another day, and see if anything turns up.  I talked to a post office, and they told me that even if package wasn't scanned in transit, the postman would def scan it upon delivery."
Etsy,3d8z4o,Vanetia,2,Tue Jul 14 13:57:32 2015 UTC,"I've made it a policy that it's up to the buyer to let me know if there's shipping issues. There's been a few that weren't updated and I was freaking out, but turned out the person got it and it just wasn't updated in the system so I was worried over nothing.  I know if I'm buying something, I feel the onus is on me to ensure I get the thing I paid for. I can't expect a shop to track every single sale."
Etsy,3d8z4o,briekachu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that contacting the seller about lost item should be buyers responsibility, I am not a busy shop, and If the package is lost, I prefer to resend them a package rather than issue a refund.

Etsy,3d88fg,ediblecheese,8,Tue Jul 14 07:26:26 2015 UTC,"You're not being phished.  Phishing involves tricking you for account numbers or passwords.   Is it the opening for some sort of scam?  I don't know.   Reply to them and ask for more information on their company.    Perhaps Google that company name and call the main phone number asking to be connected to the person who is emailing you -- see if he even works for them.     Before you commit to making pieces,  ask for references and a payment up front.   And don't start work until that money clears."
Etsy,3d88fg,funchy,4,Tue Jul 14 11:59:27 2015 UTC,Was the email address from the company domain? I would ask for a company website that you can review for legitimacy as well as customer referrals.

Etsy,3d88fg,Dustdown,4,Tue Jul 14 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"It looks more legit than a scam, but it's hard to know these days. One of the trademarks of scams is to include a few grammar mistakes etc and this looks tight.   My recommendation would be to google the company he represents, then google the message in its entirety and see if something pops up. Try including keywords 'etsy' and 'scam' - If nothing comes up you'll at least know you're the first person to fall for it. Or, more likely; this is a legit request. :) Good luck!"
Etsy,3d88fg,fribby,5,Tue Jul 14 07:45:04 2015 UTC,"A good sign is that they actually mentioned a specific item you sell, they didn't just say they are interested in purchasing ""the items you carry"".   What's up with item #2? Do they want free samples or do they want you to travel to present your items to a selection committee (where you'd be competing against other artists for a chance to have them purchased?)?   I'd be extremely cautious here."

I am leaning toward scam but it is a little hard to say, I might be too jaded haha.    Just be extremely cautious.  Request a non-refundable deposit.  Do not accept cheque or money orders and make sure to wait for the funds to clear before starting work on anything.  If you're still feeling uneasy request that they call to you to speak in person, or like someone else said, set up a Skype meeting.  Chat them up and request to see some sort of photographic sample of their work...  See how you feel after that.    Good luck!

Etsy,3d88fg,LikeTheCircus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like a variation of scam emails I've gotten trying to buy paintings (they've just moved out of the county, and want to decorate their new house, are interested in X painting, and have a shipping agent that will make arrangements)   The scam is that eventually they'll want to send you a money order, and it will be for too much money, they'll ask you to repay the difference, and then the money order turns out to be fake, but by the time the bank gets back to you, they've made off with your money.  It always seems to involve an individual or company abroad from you, and they seem to be getting better at mentioning specific things from your site to make it a little more convincing- but have a bit of an awkward writing style.  Knowing that, there is no harm in asking more questions to be sure, just don't under any circumstances send money."

Etsy,3d7hno,holyshmoke,2,Tue Jul 14 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"Not legal, just not uncommon. Someone out there DOES hold copyright over these books, and unless that seller has explicit permission to copy and distribute them then they are in violation. Problem being, Etsy wants DCMA DMCA takedown notices from the copyright holder rather than allowing us plebs to report a thing we know isn't right and investigating it themselves. There's a LOT of copyright violations going on at Etsy, and equal amounts of speculation that without copyright holder complaints they won't do anything because it makes them money - especially if it's a popular store. (Just speculation, of course...) Etsy would probably say it's because they don't want to or can't be responsible for each member's store content.  The sidebar has a link to the Crash Course youtube series on intellectual property, if you want to watch those for more info.  ETA: I typo'ed, that's DMCA"

I'd want to be fairly compensated for my labor, materials & dry cleaning, so I would charge around $100~$150.

Because that is the major thorn in my side right now.  I'm discontinuing certain things, adding new variations and changing prices and with BETSI it could have been a few clicks and done.  Etsy's variation editor is a feeble joke (and not at all what I need) so this is taking an eternity."
Etsy,3d3bb3,briekachu,3,Mon Jul 13 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"I made a random account and synced it up to my listings. From what I can tell it doesn't have a way to alter variations. It does allow you to mass update photos and add text to the title/description to all of your listings at once - which I'll be using for vacation. I just changed the prices of one entire section, that was useful. It also has ""multi shop"" capabilities so you don't need different accounts if you have multiple stores."
Etsy,3d3bb3,briekachu,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"Oh good, thanks for that info!  Big fat bummer about the variations, but it sounds like it otherwise does everything BETSI did.

Etsy,3d3bb3,skunkhaus,2,Mon Jul 13 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance, but what is/was BETSI?"
Etsy,3d3bb3,candyhippie,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"BETSI was a bulk-editing app for Etsy made by a small Australian company called Blugrin.  It allowed multiple listings to be edited all at once (great for shops with 1000 listings who want to say something about a mother's day sale, etc)  BETSI got shut down rather mysteriously by Etsy in May, and doesn't appear to be coming back any time soon.  Speculation is that it had something to do with terms of use for Apps developers, but we have no way of really knowing."
Etsy,3d3bb3,candyhippie,2,Mon Jul 13 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's not that mysterious. Chad did an interview that said Etsy was looking to monetize services that would make running a large shop easier.  Shortly after that interview they terminated BETSI's access due to some bullshit technicality in the TOS for developers that they aren't allowed to charge for services that are free to Etsy users.  But they didn't terminate Etsy on Sale (you have to pay for services that you can do for free on Etsy as well) or any of the other apps that charge fees.  They were singled out because they had such a huge subscriber base.  It was $72/year, so for every 1000 subscribers he was getting paid $72,000/year.   His subscriber base was pretty large, he could have easily been earning in the mid-to-high 6 figures so Etsy had dollar signs in their eyes.  Graeme was worth every penny.  His customer service was top notch, he was always available, and kept BETSI updated quickly whenever there was a change to Etsy's coding."
Etsy,3d3bb3,tom8o,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard about 4 different plausible arguments to explain the end of BETSI, this being one of them.  Since Betsi is appealing the decision and Etsy doesn't by policy say too much about their decision to remove API access, it's tough to know what actually happened there.  Whatever it was, it's saddening. BETSI was a great app. I heard great things about Graeme.  Never had the pleasure of speaking to him personally.  He used to be on this sub every once in a while."
Etsy,3d3bb3,pigandpeacock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah we'll never truly know what happened.  Graeme is a wonderful, kind and caring person. I hate that Etsy impacted his family's income in such an abrupt and greedy way."

Or to you just mean you were adding a high number of new listings manually? I don't have a super high number of listings now, but I think I will in a few months, so this issue you're having might affect me."
Etsy,3d17p5,ijustmadeyoubreathe,14,Sun Jul 12 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on your own unique goals for your Etsy store, but if you have a full time job, you probably don't need to spend that much time on your Etsy store.   For me, my job is my job, and Etsy is my hobby (or an extension of other hobbies like screen printing or painting). I put in as much or as little time as I like. The last thing I need out of a hobby is stress."
Etsy,3d17p5,bcgm3,8,Sun Jul 12 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"How I handle a very demanding 50-60 hour week plus Etsy:  1-2 weeks shipping window on all items. Build slowly over time.  (This is the biggest thing with doing it on the side. Take. Your. Time.)  Make prototypes and list those to see what could sell.   Automate as much as possible for canned responses, generic templates for custom listing requests.  Make everything in bulk.  But every supply in bulk.  Have friends or family help when things get busy.  Get your SO to support what you do. Prepay all shipping and never wait in line.  (Use fedex or find a PO that will let you jump the line and drop it on the counter.). Don't sell anything for less than $40.  Don't sell anything that's not in a niche.  Don't sell anything that someone can make themselves or from items found at Joanne Fabrics, Hobby Lobby or another big box.  Invest back into your equipment.  Pay yourself well.  $20+ per hour to start. (Don't sell $5 items.). Make what you sell. Splurge on one thing not etsy related - like a trip. Get 100 different ads listed - at least set that as a goal. (I'm listing 20+ new items this week.). Don't buy ads - new items are much, much, much cheaper than ads.  Find an Etsy mentor.  Find local suppliers.  Take your time. If you need $$$$ asap, Etsy isn't the right place to be.  $$$$$$$$ over time is very doable. Cross list your items on eBay, Craigslist, your web site and Amazon.  Have a FB presence, Twitter and esp Instagram.  Just add posts related to your niche and over time, people will find you.  Your Christmas sales can be very good if you are prepared.  I've already started producing my new Christmas stuff. :). Be ready to roll with Christmas stuff in October. - but put your prototypes on social media now (summer).   That's a good start."
Etsy,3d17p5,tom8o,7,Sun Jul 12 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I have my shipping times at 1-3 days to allow for any oppsies with overload at work. I give myself 1 hour an evening for Etsy packaging, shop checking. I allocate time each weekend to produce items, typically about 8 hours. Just depends on if your 9-5 is actually 9-5 or if it spans to taking some work home."
Etsy,3d17p5,PaintballKitty,3,Sun Jul 12 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"I work 845-530 monday to friday as an x-ray tech in a private office, with a 35 minute commute each day.   Most weeknights I spend sewing things to sell, and I try to sew in bulk. My sales are pretty low- maybe 5 or 6 a month, including custom orders so it doesn't take much time to fulfill those. I'll cut fabric for 8-10 makeup bags at a time, and that'll be what I work on throughout the week, about 4 or 5 hours a night. On the weekends I do all my pictures and photo editing.   Marketing, posting listings, and convos, I do from my phone during the day while at work. X-rays are done on a walk in basis, so some days I don't stop moving until 530, and some days are dead and I'm bored out of my mind. I can even do some of my production at work, like pinning, turning fabric, etc.  I use Dropbox a lot so I can get the photos for my listings, and the Etsy app allows you to do most things. If there's something like variations I need to put in, I can save the finished listing as a draft, and add that at home.   To be fair though, my husband and I don't kids yet, sewing (not quilting. I HATE quilting lol) is fairly portable, I can work on it at work, and my sales are pretty low through Etsy so its not a busy shop. My coworkers are some of my best customers, but they'll buy ready made stuff 😀"

Etsy,3d17p5,phillip_fryman,3,Sun Jul 12 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"I package and ship stuff one day a week. All of my orders have 1-2 two weeks processing time, so I generally have enough time to get everything sent out on time.   The real problem with balancing a full time job and an online shop is finding the time/motivation to create new items. I started a new job in April and haven't created anything new since then. It is very difficult for me to work 9-5, then come home and create something new. I am a web developer / graphic designer at my day job and my shop sells posters I design, so its hard for me to work all day then come home and work more. I just want to relax after work.  It didn't take long for this to negatively effect my sales as they have absolutely gone down since I started my latest job."
Etsy,3d17p5,armoreddragon,3,Sun Jul 12 23:21:01 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about what advise you read. When you're running a hobby/side business, your life and situation are your own. Do what works for you.  Myself, I don't think spending time constantly tweaking listings and trying to promote stuff helps. What seems to matter for me is spending time to make new things, and posting them up. All the new things I make I'll post up also to Tumblr, DeviantArt, and a couple other galleries, and that's where I'll get views from.  In general my rough goal is to make one thing each week that's worth posting, whether that's a new design or a medium-sized custom order. I don't always manage that, though some weeks I'll pound out a small pile of new items. My day job has a bunch of spikes of business, so the amount of time I have each week varies. But every day before bed I'll check Etsy, email and galleries and try to deal with correspondence in a timely manner. I try to work on making things 3-4 evenings each week. Often I'll end up photographing things on the weekend, and posting photos and listings up can sometimes eat up the rest of that day."

When I get home, I spend 2ish hours on creating new products. Some days you may not get time to work on too much. Just figure out those things you can do every day even if you don't have time to work on products. While you're on the commode, read /r/Etsy to see what people are talking about.   It all kinda depends on your lifestyle. Most of my friends go out and drink & party all the time. I've been more focused on making more money and making sure what I am doing at most any given time is productive. If you're passionate enough about what you're doing, 2 hrs / week day shouldn't be hard. You can also say Monday's Wednesday's & Friday's are promotional days... Then Tuesday's and Thursday's you'll work on creating your products. It's all about organization. To help stay organized, I use and app/website called Trello. It's pretty helpful. Great for goal setting and organization."

Sometimes I'll swear that I'm taking a day off for myself, and then end up on Etsy any way.  I have something like 3 weeks of paid vacation and 3 floating holidays during the year, so I schedule my vacation time around a large antique show that we have 3x a year, and use those weeks to buy next stock and focus on the shop.  Since I go into work in the afternoon, I can package items and get to the post office before work. I can usually do some computer stuff at night before bed."

I opened my shop last week and I've been trying to figure out how to balance my day job, etsy, and personal life. There seriously isn't enough hours in a day!  Sometimes you have to make big changes to your life if you want to run a successful etsy shop. I personally started waking up earlier to do some promotions and checking stats and after work spend 2 hours trying to create something. Getting a calender and marking your to-do lists on it is a great help because you see your week planned out for you. Plus, it feels good to cross things off the list. Hang it up somewhere you can see it all the time."

Etsy,3d17p5,courtneyj,2,Tue Jul 14 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"Bleh, I started in January 2014 and was balls to the wall for about six months; the peak of which was wedding season in June.    With my own wedding, the Honeymoon, buying a house, getting a dog, etc. (as well as having a full time job) I decided then and there that I would taper back with Etsy and kind of fill orders as they came.  I was spending easily another 20 hours a week on Etsy on top of the 40-45 hours a week at my fulltime job.  Christmas was a huge boon for me as was Father's Day but other than that business has been slow(ish).  I still get several sales a month but nowhere near what I was churning out last year.    If I had advice for anyone juggling between a full time job and Etsy it would probably be to start out slow and with a plan.  Don't cram it all in at once or else you'll, like me, burn out after a few months."

I basically have no social life which for the most part I'm okay with because I've become more introverted as I've gotten older.  I do have a day job at a computer, so in downtime I can reply to emails and maybe tweak some online listings and post a few things to social media.  Usually dinner consists of something quick so I work on business related things. The post office is on the way the way to the office so I can drop off orders daily if need be, and we do a fair amount of printing and shipping through Fedex which is a nice lunchtime walk from the office. If I have to make a special trip to either of these places, it's out of my way.  We are slowly reaching the point of one of us having to quit our job and the ultimate goal is to open a shop which will ""free up"" some time by getting rid of the day job!"
Etsy,3d17p5,ihaveacutepuppy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"If you start with a good foundation i don't think you need to be spending all that much time working on your store. Your goal should be good tags, well lit pictures, a wide swath of items that are cohesive enough to be a line of products but different enough to cover the needs of many different people and how they search. Perfect the basics, then come up with new items and one at a time introduce them with good copy, photos and tagging to ensure success. You shouldn't need to be going over things again and again. Only add a new item per day/week/month, whatever works for your scheduled. Spend a little time up front to allow yourself time for successful production later.  But honestly, as for me, my production times are 1-2 weeks and I took a work from home job 3.5 years ago so I could have the freedom to work on my store as I needed. Doing that gave me an extra 3-4 hours per day to work with (An hour or more getting ready, 40 minutes to commute in, 40 minutes to commute out on good days, now lunch takes me 10 mins instead of a required 60 away from home in an office cafeteria..). It lets me be flexible with my time which has been extremely important in growing my store (and being able to mod this place too!)."

During the week on my breaks at work I'll occasionally post an in-progress shot to instagram. I try to add at least one item to my shop a week, and either on Saturday morning or one day mid-week(based on when the sales came in) I ship everything out.  I don't make a ton of money on my still newish shop, but I do pull about 50-100$ a week with steadily increasing views and repeat customers.  I think a big thing is to set aside time for your craft (mine is jewelry, so I do it while watching Netflix at my desk and it doubles as relaxing time at the end of the day) and to not feel bad if you miss it, or go over. =) If you lose the desire to work on the actual things you're making, you definitely won't have the gumption to get the shop running/working smoothly."

Be motivated enough to schedule time for this and stick to it. I use my lunch break off of company time/property to learn/sketch/ research suppliers so that's 30 minutes then after the kid goes to sleep i stay up an extra 2-3hrs to work on this and learn more.   The weekends are my sewing days i can whip up one shirt in 3hrs right now and that's all broken up like cut fabric, stop and take care of baby, play with baby until she takes a nap then pin, serge, finish one side of shirt, repeat baby care, finish the back, start serging it together, repeat baby care, until it's done so all the work time =3hrs with baby care it's really the whole afternoon lol  TL;DR be motivated enough to schedule the time to work on your shop."

Etsy,3d03p2,tom8o,5,Sun Jul 12 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I went from 1-3 days to 3-5 and only change it during holiday seasons. Most of the time orders still go out in the 1-3 time frame but it gives me cushion if there's a complicated order or a bunch in one day.

I'm a seller on Etsy, and occasionally I'll have a burst of sales where the demand will exceed my supply capacity for the time I set until the item is dispatched. I generally have 3-5 business days, but every now and then I'll receive to many orders and in quick succession (and generally while I'm asleep). Is there a way (a script maybe?) to tell Etsy that if I receive x orders, then it should update the dispatch time to x amount?   Yep, under promise, over deliver!"
Etsy,3d03p2,aycockdesigns,3,Sun Jul 12 15:29:36 2015 UTC,Agreed to everything above. I'm set at 1-2 weeks but only once came close to the 2 week mark and that was because I was living out of my in-laws house during a remodel.

If it means anything, this happens to me as well - in terms of people leaving a review mentioning something negative and when I offer to replace/fix/refund I never hear back from them. I wonder if people just want to leave a bad review because they're having a bad day and then don't want to acknowledge the comments they made so they don't respond. As a buyer that review wouldn't bother me as long as I knew that it wasn't common or that I could return an item."

Etsy,3cyg3w,PiranhaPony,2,Sun Jul 12 00:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a day or two more, then if I didn't hear anything I would post a response along the lines of ""We are sorry to hear you are unhappy with your purchase. All vintage items are considered as used, however if you are not satisfied with the condition we would be happy to offer you a refund upon return of the hat. We have tried to reach out to you via (insert method used, Etsy convo, email etc) however have not received a response. If you would like to return the item for a refund, please get in touch - you can find our email address on your invoice or you can contact us via the Etsy messaging system.""

Etsy,3cyg3w,locustandplum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:42:22 2015 UTC,Perfect way to go about it. For the future make sure you put on your policies that vintage is considered used and in the listings if its new make sure to advertise that.

I assume you left that implied with the vintage tag, but people are still pretty dumb sometimes. Some will straight up ignore what it really means and assume vintage is the styling for an item. I'm guessing that is what happened with that customer of yours?  Just reply with what everyone suggested. All of these posted are really good, merge whatever you want or just go for a straight copy and paste."

Etsy,3cyg3w,tom8o,2,Mon Jul 13 02:03:47 2015 UTC,The fact that the person made a snide comment about goodwill on a seller of vintage items page will discredit them with most people. I agree with others that you have every right to say something polite about having reached out and not hearing back.

Etsy,3cxz9n,dewprisms,17,Sat Jul 11 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to get a jeweler that is willing to trade your settings for another setting they create and then set the gems into because the other band is not just materials but their labor and their designs. Then they have to do something with those settings, which is additional labor for them.  Your best bet would to be to get the loose stones and then sell your gold and use that cash to purchase the design of a new setting. You can also take the white gold one and have it melted down and that metal go towards a new setting to save on costs. Jewelers won't have any issue working with loose stones that you provide so that should be no issue.  You may want to look for local jewelers in your area. Don't go to chain spots like Zales or Kay- look for locally owned spots, and research them online for ratings. Ask people you know as well for recommendations, especially older people that have been around longer and may have more experience with local businesses."
Etsy,3cxz9n,celtic_smith,14,Sat Jul 11 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Here is the problem... You don't have 5k worth of jewellery, that's the retail price. You are going to sell it for scrap value, which can be 20% of retail.  You are much better off just selling the jewellery and using the money to pay a reputable jeweller."
Etsy,3cxz9n,funchy,5,Sat Jul 11 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure a reputable custom ring maker would barter their work for some raw materials.  Unfortunately when gold and silver jewelry is sold to be melted down, you don't get much.    In my opinion I'd sell the rings for whatever you can get.   You could keep some of the stones.  Then talk to a few established custom ring makers to get prices and details.     You don't have to use etsy.   You could search online to see who in your region does this kind of work.  And it removes the issue of insuring expensive stones or a really expensive finished piece through the mail."
Etsy,3cxz9n,jareths_tight_pants,3,Sat Jul 11 22:13:14 2015 UTC,My engagement set was from Mastergoldcraft on Etsy and I know he does his own casting as he did custom work for me. He can definitely work with your loose stones and he might be willing to take the white gold setting and melt it down but you're still going to have to pay for the design and time. I'd sell the other settings and use it towards the new one. You're going to gets a fraction of the value though.
Etsy,3cxz9n,lazyladytiger,3,Sun Jul 12 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is local jewelers. My custom rose gold peach sapphire engagement ring was half paid for by trade ins. My family is plagued with divorce. My mother grandmother and great grandmother gave me diamonds engagement rings and more to put toward my ring. May sound weird but I didn't want a tainted diamond so I traded it in to my family friend who is a local jeweler. Worth trying, just gotta get out there and ask! Good luck"
Etsy,3cxz9n,pigandpeacock,2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:29 2015 UTC,I work for a national jewelry company and we run a program that can probably help you out with that (or a big part of it). If you want to message me directly I can ell you more about it.  Basically we have jewelers that can take your stones and place them in new mountings that you choose (there are 3 stone options) and some of the more experienced jewelers may be able to take your existing rings and turn them into something new.

Do that, list some more items ... come back with some specific questions, people are very helpful happy to give advice. Welcome to Etsy!"
Etsy,3cy6ri,rabbit555,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:05:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you think the price is okay? it's smaller then my hand.  Also how do I make tags? What should be in my about page?
Etsy,3cy6ri,armoreddragon,4,Sat Jul 11 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say to up the price. In general, make the best work you can, and price it to give yourself a fair wage. Even if it's a side project/hobby business, price your pieces at a rate that you could make a good happy living off of if you were making them full-time. And keep in mind this paradox of pricing: Often times, pricing something higher will make people more inclined to buy it, because they'll think of it as higher quality and therefore more desirable."
Etsy,3cy6ri,kokomocat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"Oh right, that actually makes a lot of sense.  I think I'll start at 15$ for things like these unless the material is different, then I'll raise. It means either 15$ an hour or 7.50$ an hour.   I just want to make 100$ for a start.  Edit: which means 6-ish items to get to that goal. I can make that much in a day, so it's not out of a question.   Thanks by the way! you've been a lot of help."
Etsy,3cy6ri,kokomocat,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"I get your idea but I think your banner needs some work. For example, the general position of ""Dramatic Fox"" is off-center, both height and weight wise... Maybe you could center it some. Then the mix between caps and lowercase doesn't fit well; it looks rather unorganized instead of fun/interactive/playful. Giving an overall uniformity to your text such as same height, same width and adjusting the kerning (spacing between the characters) could do wonders for it. When I see it, honestly, the first thing I think of is either Lego or Pixel art, not clay... But that's just my perception.  About your icon (I'm guessing your seller picture?) I like it! I still think, though, that you could work on your typography."
Etsy,3cy6ri,Christypaints,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll work on it. I just kept getting anxiety and then shutting down gimp before I could finish.  I'll just keep on trying until I get the words correct. Or scrap it all together.

Keep an eye on the user URL to see if it's still alive after X number of days. Not sure how long their ""investigations"" take.  Some people use this on craigslist as well. I had a friend get sent around the same message for his car listing. Yes they even do it for cars.

I had them listed with a very reasonable price for a while, I got tons of views but no sales. I decided to see if anyone had intrest in them for a higher price on Etsy. I guess this defeats the purpose of Esty a bit but there are people on Etsy with very large wallets. In The Netherlands we have a saying, Nee heb je ja kun je krijgen.

Etsy,3cwhm9,PawedUp,2,Sat Jul 11 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"I understand somewhat. Some art can cash out for a truckload of money. I recall seeing a few pieces that looked very simple and were around 12""-24"" (probably cost $20-30 in materials and 1-2hours of time), which were selling for around $1-2k a pop. The seller was able to build a brand for herself around her name and I think that is where the money is, in a name. A lot has to do w/ history, but the name can build into something more powerful. Rarity as well. If you're making pieces that are unique, one of a kind that nobody will ever have except for that 1 purchaser, then you can command a bit more. Just depends on what truly drives people to buy @ the end of the day, which I can't even put a finger on as I'm clueless on art. I see a lot of art and go, hmmmm, did some shit like that in 5th grade, hmmm a thousand dollars, hmmm got a C+ grade if that for mine."

A store opens up using the same pictures as half a dozen other stores and have a few thousand positive reviews within a week, there is no way etsy doesn't know exactly what that store is but it makes them money.   It's driving away the small home businesses that were their core at startup.  Based on the latest etsy survey they sent along with mutterings on various message boards my personal opinion is we won't see much of etsy within a year or so, customers can just use ebay and they are used to ebay.   Sorry for the unrelated rant"
Etsy,3cwhm9,vintagekaren,2,Sat Jul 11 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"Hopefully amazon handmade will be a big thing. I have yet to analyze their handmade % commissions vs their commissions right now, but I assume it's the same. The only difference I see is that there will be 2 sections, their basic e commerce and their handmade e commerce. Nothing is stopping anyone from listing their stuff on amazon now, so I don't see why it makes a bit of difference. Amazon is trusted, has very good deals on shipping, and has a large customer base, so that should be enough to perk up someones nipples when switching over. Wish I knew if it was FBA or not, will have to look into it.  Been nice if there was an actual handmade e commerce site that stuck to it's roots (truly handmade), instead of what ETSY is doing. Yes, I think the fact they're making money off those shops is solely why they keep them. Why else. It doesn't seem like it's ruining their rep w/ customers, only shop owners that are facing the tougher competition by shops that can 'knockout' tons of pieces w/ lower prices, because they're not making them. The shops owners can't just pick up shop and move elsewhere, because there is really no other place like ETSY. Sure there are other outlets, but ETSY is known for handmade goods which brings a particular clientele.  Unrelated rant #2."

Amazon Handmade on the other hand could have a major impact.

Etsy,3cx8ny,PawedUp,3,Sat Jul 11 18:09:21 2015 UTC,ETSY ads will outweigh FB ads.  On ETSY you're targeting customers in the buying/researching mood. They're already there either planning a purchase at that moment or a purchase later in the future.
Etsy,3cx8ny,aycockdesigns,2,Sat Jul 11 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"As a Social Media Marketing Manager, I can tell you that Facebook ads can be EXTREMELY valuable! But you can waste your money in a heartbeat if you don't know what you're doing.   It's very important to have quality images (recommended size for ad), targeting set exactly right. It also depends on what your goal is. To send people to your shop, I'd recommend using the product ads (where you can use more than one picture). It's important to test what works, and what doesn't. You may want to go over to /r/SocialMedia and get some pointers there. Or research it like crazy. Huge companies use it, and it works for them. Small companies like the one I work for use it, and it works for us. A-B testing is important. Start with 4 different images, all with the same text. Whichever performs the best, only use that picture... then try 4 different copies (text)... figure out which one has the highest CTR (click through rate). I definitely recommend seeking advertising / marketing advice via blog posts non-etsy related though. Most sellers on Etsy don't know the business side of things as they do their own craft."

Etsy,3cu9oj,mewk69,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:14:19 2015 UTC,"This. Plus it's good to pass the karma around. I favorite most of my competitions shops, and any of their work that I love."
Etsy,3cu9oj,aycockdesigns,2,Sat Jul 11 08:38:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't. The reason being is because people seem to lose sight of the fact that it's business. I do understand some people do Etsy as a hobby, however if you want to make the best of what you make, and make many sales - giving your competitors 'favorites' is not the best way to do so.  An extreme example -> Let's say Apple favorites one of Windows' listings / tweets / likes / etc... It doesn't make sense, and it doesn't make sense to your customers. To me, a ""favorite"" is somewhat an endorsement.   On the other hand, I absolutely think you should keep track of what your competitors are doing. But I would keep that to yourself. It's good to know where you stand against your competition.   I love business, and love the competition of selling. I know the majority on Etsy is a little soft on this, but I think it's important no matter what you're selling or where you're selling.  And if getting favorites are truly a beneficial thing, why give the shop your benefit when they will be getting all of the business that you could have, but gave away? Ya know?"
Etsy,3cu9oj,failgiraffe,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"So I'm not a seller on Etsy (and this is a little late) but this reminds me of a situation where I did some copy writing for a party planner's blog.   In literally the easiest gig ever, I would write up little blurbs about parties she hosted as well as reviews of other planner's parties. These reviews were always positive.   Now, the key thing here is that these party planners were NOT direct competition. They were mostly other bloggers in different cities.   This gave her a couple key advantages:   -Let's say she's never hosted a Toy Story themed party but she recently reviewed one. A client can instantly say ""I want a party similar to this one"" without having to describe vague aspects they wanted or link lots of conflicting Google image results.    -Next, when she linked to these parties, the other bloggers often received some kind of notification. Often, they would check out her blog. This sometimes translated to them linking to her blog from their own.   -Now let's combine the two. Customer wants a Toy Story party and NEEDS NEEDS NEEDS some decor item or the party will be a complete failure. The original party thrower has a positive relationship with the party planner due to the positive blog post. It's much easier to reach out to the original party thrower and ask  where they found the item than searching store after store.   -Minor, but finally, I think it made her look like a really friendly person. Her blogging all these parties and giving such positive feedback made it seem like she was passionate about making everyone happy. It made her seem like a person first, business second.   Now let's think about this from an Etsy perspective. Is this person in another country? Do they ship to your country? Could you learn something helpful from them? Could being more active on the interface make you seem more relatable to buyers?   There's no 100% foolproof guide to this, but I think those are some of the questions you should be asking yourself."

I have fun adding items I like and sometimes I go back and buy them, but I also believe it does give my products a little bit of exposure to people who might have a similar style as me.

But I see others that make similar hypoallergenic studs and they usually are not priced over $15. I want customers, but I also don't want to be too cheap or too pricey."
Etsy,3ctu4h,mochacup94,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"Make sure you at least total up the cost it took for materials, and then base the selling price off of quality and time put into it. I usually sell jewelry from $10-$20, and there are plenty of people who buy it. Don't ever sell yourself short. I had a woman buy a little over $200 on jewelry alone a couple of months ago. Also, having proper lighting and setups for your pieces helps tenfold. I usually set up a white sheet on our patio table outside and take pictures from there. Presentation is everything!"
Etsy,3ctu4h,briekachu,8,Mon Jul 13 01:17:18 2015 UTC,"Feel free to post your shop!   There DEFINITELY IS such a thing as setting your prices too low. Value yourself and your time, without charging something outrageous. Also if something is priced too low then it gives off the impression that they are cheap (in the tacky way).   I don't know how long you work on your earrings, the exact materials and what they look like so it's hard to really judge if you're putting a fair price on your work."
Etsy,3ctu4h,Noctier,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:02:43 2015 UTC,The reason why I wanted to bring this up is because I myself see others who sell similar products will sell them at the same prices if not 1 to 2 usd more. I work on a batch of 10 earrings approximately at a time. As a total that is about 5 pairs with the exception of mess ups.  I added my link to the description...
Etsy,3ctu4h,OceanSiren,7,Fri Jul 10 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there's such a thing as setting prices too low. When I see things priced much lower than similar items on Etsy, I tend to assume one of the following:    The item is not really handmade; it was made in a factory and being resold (this is what I'd be most likely to assume with jewelry). There's something wrong with the item which the pictures do not show.  The item is made with low-quality materials, or uses low-quality construction techniques, or both.    The only exception is items which are on sale (and therefore priced lower than the rest of the items in the store). You could do that with the items you made a long time ago. For the rest, I think you should look around and see what similar products are going for.   Without knowing anything more about your products, $10 is not necessarily too low for what you described, but you might be able to raise your prices a bit as well. After doing a quick search, it seems like there's a lot of resin stud earrings selling in the $10 range... But most are priced closer to $15, and some are even more expensive. I'd look around for similar products, look at their prices, look at how many sales each store has, and see if you can estimate the relationship between prices and profits."
Etsy,3ctu4h,OceanSiren,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this detailed response. I will look around, compare with other competing shops, and look at what I can set as my max price."
Etsy,3ctu4h,joealarson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"After looking at your shop, it looks like your prices are about right. I have little earrings similar to yours (I use surgical steel) and did a lot of research on it before pricing them. It seems like most sell around the $10 mark. Are you not making a lot of profit from the $10 sales?"
Etsy,3ctu4h,candyhippie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"That's encouraging that you have had good results. I am looking into surgical steel, titanium, or even sterling silver in the near future. I've only had 31 sales in a little over a year. I'd love to say I'm making a profit, but the amount of money I spend on supplies out-weights the profits."
Etsy,3ctu4h,joealarson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"With these posts earrings, if you wont be able to make a significant profit by raising your prices by ~$1-$2, you need to find a better supplier. In this case, I would suggest looking for new suppliers to lower your supply cost. There are times where you up your price when the market allows for it, but there are times when market does not allow it and you have to find new ways to make profit.   I would suggest to stop buying from Hobby Lobby and start buying in bulk. There are many sellers (even on Etsy; I bought some from a seller and paid 8 cents for each post.) with pretty good bulk prices on earring posts."
Etsy,3ctu4h,joealarson,3,Sat Jul 11 05:23:11 2015 UTC,"I had my TARDIS rings set at $3, because it really wasn't any trouble for me to print them like that. Had someone order 80 of them (at a discount) to sell them at a con, which they did at $10 each. Raised my prices after that.  I say if the market will bear it raise your prices as high as you can. Money can't buy you happiness, but it helps."

Etsy,3ctu4h,badasimo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:20:42 2015 UTC,Did it bother you that someone was going to buy them and then resell them? Your 3D printed designs are really cool. I guess raising them a little bit ($1-2) isn't TOO bad.
Etsy,3ctu4h,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:05 2015 UTC,It didn't bother me at all. They approached me and told me that's what they were doing. They just didn't tell me what they were going to sell them at. But they were forth coming with what they charged when I asked after the con and I'm grateful. They were even willing to tell me I was undercharging right from the start and when they sold out at $10 I knew they had a point.  I'm just glad I have a story to tell to help others now.
Etsy,3ctu4h,MisssMonica,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:23:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what the market looks like for earrings of that sort. If they really are super fast and inexpensive to make, maybe $10 is fine. But remember, when figuring the price for an item, you also need to pay yourself for the overhead--like the time it takes to photograph them, post them online, package and ship them.   My more broad feeling, though, is that it's really hard to make money selling $10 items in a fairly saturated market. I would consider what sorts of larger items you could make. Maybe pendants would work. Something that's in keeping with the sorts of items you already make, but hits a higher price point. Having bigger, more unique items can help distinguish you from other sellers and draw people in. And people respond well to having a range of different priced items to choose between. Think about what you could make that someone would expect to pay $25, $50, or $100 for. Many people will lean towards buying something that's more expensive, because they want something that feels more special or meaningful."
Etsy,3ctu4h,candyhippie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:04:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for this insight. I have been creating new dangle earrings in a way I haven't seen done on etsy before. Hopefully bringing these items to my shop will help add some uniqueness. Also I have been looking at making pendants and hopefully will finish them and add them to the shop within the next month! Thanks again!
Etsy,3ctu4h,trialstroublestribs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings on this. I think that the real way you should be pricing is the following:   Identify your keywords Look at competing items in keyword. Are they direct competition? If your stuff is better, you can charge higher prices. If their stuff is better, you should beat their price to give the consumer a cheaper option. If there are no competing items then you're in luck! You've encountered a niche market and you should price in the difficulty of finding alternatives to your product.   And as always make sure you're making money.  This isn't a charity!"
Etsy,3csich,hisownboss,5,Fri Jul 10 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"What did you do before you opened your shop? I was a college student in my last semester for Information Systems with a job waiting for me once I graduated. I was your average college student going to class and working as a server full time. I've had a job since I was 15 (with parent consent) so I was always working and being artistic.  What motivated you to open your shop? I make jewelry and Prints (Prints are new) I opened up my jewelry shop because I wear a larger ring size than the ""average"" woman and no one ever offered my size. Being the creative person I am…. I said I can do this why not.  So I started off making bracelets and necklaces and I didn't really go anywhere. I sold about 200 my first year of business. I took a chance on soldering plain band rings and crown rings and expanded from there. I now make 14k gold rings and everything in between. I love almost every single moment of it. Etsy keeps me creative where my career is not creative at all.   How much money in sales have you made up till now? I have now sold 3,200 items in my jewelry shop and i'm doing very well :)   How were you able to promote your shop? I worked on my SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on etsy and finally figured out a good way for me to be discovered. I promote myself on instagram but for some reason I can't get over 500 people to follow me so I must not take very good instagram photos :P   Is your shop based solely on etsy or do you use other platforms? I am solely based on etsy but I do have my own website and I started in implement my jewelry into it but life happens and I was not able to keep up with my career, etsy and working on my shop blog.  Which are your biggest challenges in running the shop? My biggest challenges are time to complete the jewelry in a timely manner. I have a carrer which I enjoy very much but I also have my business which I enjoy because it gives me a creative outlet my carrer doesn't do. I currently have a processing time of 2-3 weeks because not only in the jewelry time consuming to make I also get a lot of orders daily / weekly to keep up with.  Are you doing this full time or do you have other projects on the side? I do my career fulltime and I also do etsy full time so I guess I’m a workaholic. Around the holiday time you can definitely get burnt out from the rush of orders but if you mentally prepare for it, it makes it easier. You also learn a lot during that time. Mostly how under prepared you are ;)  What advice would you give to people who are just starting out? My advice would be you will not be successful over night! I cannot stress that enough this is not an instant money maker. You have to put a lot of time and research into building your brand and how you want to be perceived. When you are on the forums or interacting with other people always be professional to the best of your ability because you are a reflection on your business.  Also GREAT photos are a complete must have a long with SEO. There are so many articles and google to help you achieve those very things. Go on the etsy forums and search to see what other people have posted and answers given to them. The forum is a great tool but not everyone agrees so you have to be able to take criticism.  Remember 80% chance there is someone already doing what you want to do, so figure out how to make yourself unique and stand out. You should continue to list regularly, the ""magic"" number to get this rolling is 100 listings. Granted I found this to be true for me but I was also making some large changes in my business at the time.    Mistakes will happen and how you handle them will be a reflection on your business but it's not the end of the world if you get a ""bad"" review. Your response can hurt you more than the original review. You can not make everyone happy! Try not to take things too personal (still working on that) heheh  Where do you see yourself in 3 years? Working on my career and still doing something with jewelry. I hope etsy is still around but I also hope to get my website up and running to be able to take orders so I don't have to depend on etsy.

Etsy,3csich,Missy1726,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"Those are some interesting answers! Thank you for sharing your story Vanessa.  I have some follow up questions if you don't mind:  So you saw a need (larger ring sizes) and you filled it by creating your own shop. How hard was it for you to learn the art of jewelry making given that you come from a different background (Information Systems)? Were you always experimenting with this (jewelry making) or was there a moment where you said ""I want to do this"" and you started doing it directly? If so, how much time passed from that moment until you decided to open your shop?  As you know I would like to post this on my blog. Would it be Ok to use some of your photos to showcase your work?  Thanks again for taking the time to answer the questions :)"
Etsy,3csich,Missy1726,2,Fri Jul 10 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"I've always been creative even when I was younger. You wouldn't know because I went into technology but I enjoy both :) I never really did anything with jewelry except maybe friendship bracelets like every young girl does when they are 10/11. To be honest I am always looking for a way to be creative and make money at it. I love that you can do something that you really enjoy doing and make money at it. I'm sure at some point I said lets do this... lets open a shop. I'm pretty impulsive so I'm 90% sure I opened my shop that day and created those bracelets and when that wasn't bring enough money in I really got into making rings (birthstone rings)   You can find my ""journey"" by looking at my previous sales and see the bracelets I used to make. The photos weren't that good but I enjoyed it at the time. I have really improved since than and you can see it through a small timeline. I like to remind myself sometimes where I started and where I am now are 2 completely different places.   If i'm missing anything else or you want more details just let me know!

I had success selling locally and had been asked/encouraged about selling online/with Etsy, so I went for it.   How much money in sales have you made up till now? if this is too personal, feel free to skip it   I have only been open a few months with limited sales on Etsy. I have been selling locally for a few months as well. I've made approximately $350. Not a lot but we're just starting out!   How were you able to promote your shop?   I have joined various crafting groups on Facebook (and have a Facebook page), I also use Instagram and advertise in local Facebook yard sale pages.

This is my side business but I do other things in addition to this and my full time job.   What advice would you give to people who are just starting out?   I don't know that I am qualified to give advice but... make sure you have a good amount of product before you start listing on etsy. Have good quality photographs and great descriptions. Make sure your shop policies are filled out. A facebook page can't hurt at all, I would suggest having one of those and updated it frequently, even if it's just to say ""Hey everyone, hows it going?! We've been super busy lately~!""   Where do you see yourself in 3 years?   Ideally, running my shop as my only/main job and making at least what I make working full time right now.

Etsy,3csich,combustionbustion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"What did you do before you opened your shop?  Not much of anything. I had gotten out of the music business in Nashville, got married, and bought a farm about 30 miles south. I was working mainly as a photographer and farmer by that point.  What motivated you to open your shop?  My wife started it. She wanted something to do, so she started making crafts from the wool of our flock of rare and exotic Jacob sheep. I saw that she was doing well with it - so I started adding my own things to it. At first, mostly woodworking. I eventually added a lot more items of my own - vintage watches, antique cast iron & musical instruments, vintage toys, etc.   How much money in sales have you made up till now? if this is too personal, feel free to skip it  Jeez - it's difficult to say total over the last 3 years. It's a slow time of year, but we've done around $2000 in sales in the last week.   How were you able to promote your shop?  We never really have. Other than practicing very good SEO, and having pro-quality photographs - that's about it. It's been almost exclusively word-of-mouth.   Is your shop based solely on etsy or do you use other platforms?  Almost entirely based on Etsy.  Which are your biggest challenges in running the shop?  Shipping can be very time-consuming. Photographing each item and writing copy for the listings is also very time-consuming. We're busy people. Finding the time to do everything that needs to get done is probably our biggest challenge. I often find myself still working at 4AM to get things finished.  Are you doing this full time or do you have other projects on the side?  It's a full-time job for the both of us now. We also have two part-time employees that help here and there. I do other work on the side myself, but my wife does not.   What advice would you give to people who are just starting out?  Stand out. Do something unique. Photography, jewelry, knitting, etc. doesn't generally do well on Etsy, as you get lost in a sea of millions of others. I think one of the biggest keys to our success is having a very large variety of items in our shop - not just variations of one thing like most folks do.   Where do you see yourself in 3 years?  Hopefully doing the same thing - only more of it. A little more, at least. I'm not sure how much more of a workload I can handle. It's a great deal of work at times, but we both enjoy it.  __  Hope that helps a little. Good luck to you. :-)"

Etsy,3ctac6,Kipepeogirl,4,Fri Jul 10 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on opening your shop!  I'd go back through your policy pages and flesh it out more professionally. Your banner is cute, reminds me of being a little kid (assuming this is the vibe you're going for).  Your pictures are good for just opening but I think you'll want to do another version soon with a better white balance. The Pink heart Glitter ""Barbie's Disco"" is too bright in the top right. Your pictures are all taken in the same place but they look really inconsistent. The second picture on that listing (the frontal view) looks much better.  I do like the pictures of the necklaces actually on a person (in the tank top, the yellow looks odd). I think if it were my shop I'd think about taking pictures like that but closer and at an angle and use those. Just something to think about. There's a nice contrast between the skin tone and the necklaces.  ""Barbie's Disco"" is copyright. You'll need to change the name away from Barbie and not use the name in your description.  Today I learned: ""In the U.S. and Canada, it’s customize, customized, customizing, customization, customizable, etc. Outside North America, it’s customise, customised, customising, customisation, customisable, etc.  My mental (and Firefox) spellchecker is going crazy. :P  Your prices seem reasonable, as does shipping. The listing descriptions (using neon splatter as I write this) look kind of chaotic and scatterbrained. You also don't need to say it's by ""Little Bubble on Etsy"" because that's evident. I also think you're using Monochrome wrong because there's more than one color.   What is under the silver-plated chain? I'd include more information about that just because metal allergies are a thing (I have a nickel allergy).   Sorry for the wall of text. You're doing great so far. (: Keep it up!"

I just kind of shot them, picked the best one, and edited to look as close to the real necklaces as possible. On my screen the photo in question looks OK - I'll take a look on different screens, and put taking better photos on my to-do list (there's a photo on one of my listings I really don't like, but it shows the necklace at different angles).      I do like the pictures of the necklaces actually on a person (in the tank top, the yellow looks odd).

The listing descriptions (using neon splatter as I write this) look kind of chaotic and scatterbrained. You also don't need to say it's by ""Little Bubble on Etsy"" because that's evident. I also think you're using Monochrome wrong because there's more than one color.   To be honest I copied that ""by Little Bubble on Etsy"" from a couple of shops in my favourites which are pretty successful. I guess they're doing it for SEO? But I suppose it would make more sense to put the main description there instead.  I used 'monochrome' to describe the black and white glitter in the pendant; I think it was because I couldn't fit ""black and white"" in the title. But on the whole it doesn't describe the necklace itself, so I'll take that out.      What is under the silver-plated chain? I'd include more information about that just because metal allergies are a thing (I have a nickel allergy).   I have an allergy to certain metals too. I don't know which metal exactly, but if it's not gold or silver I can only wear it for a few hours with little discomfort (my mum can't wear it at all). But I didn't even think of that, oops!     Thanks for your critique, it's been very helpful. :)"
Etsy,3ctac6,aqualala1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"First off, I really love the banner. Looks cool.  Next, you're really going to have to flesh your policies out. You should also add some bullet points or hyphens to help break up the different points that you make in the policies page.   The pictures are all pretty good aside from the difference shades of white, if that makes sense. I've got the same problem, so I can't say much to help out there. For consistency, you should take photos of them all in the same position.   Some of these are crooked compared to the others. You've got the Pink Heart Necklace that breaks it up a bit since it's lying down and in a totally different position. You did good for the other photos though with it on someone two different times. That's great, it gives people a pretty much perfect idea of what it looks like when worn.   It's good that you gave people the length of the chain and the dimensions for the pendant itself. It's nice that you put in what the chain is made from in order to help those with any potential allergies.  The listing descriptions are a bit hard to break up, but that's probably just me. I really wish Etsy let us do more with the descriptions.. I'd love a bold or italicized option.  I think you should really mention more that the nail polish used is also handmade, that's a really great selling point. It shows there's a lot more love put into the necklace and it gives more of a handmade, personal touch, if that makes sense."

I ordered it Wednesday I think and it said shipping in 1-3 days. Got a message with the shipping notice it would be shipping on 7/12. So, to be fair, it's not much of an additional wait but I'm bothered that it feels like a bit of a lie not to say it upfront. Again, if there was a note I never saw it but I don't think there was."
Etsy,3ctl1g,briekachu,2,Fri Jul 10 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see a notice either. The delay isn't significant though.   Especially since 7/12 is an accurate ship date for something you purchased on Wednesday.  Since Thursday, Friday, and Monday are the three business days.

Etsy,3co0b1,locustandplum,3,Thu Jul 9 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"I'll PM you the link!    Unfortunately, USPS doesn't offer a flat-rate box large enough. I'm using a box that is about 16""x16""x16"" to fit all 9 mugs."
Etsy,3co0b1,locustandplum,3,Thu Jul 9 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"What if you would have used two flat rate boxes? I'm not sure how tall those mugs are but it seems like when things go over 12"", that is when prices really start to add up. At least for USPS as I haven't used any other carrier since I opened my shop.   Did you agree to a shipping price prior to them placing their order?"
Etsy,3co0b1,armoreddragon,3,Thu Jul 9 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"I couldn't fit all 9 mugs into 2 flat rates boxes given all the padding I'm including to prevent breakage.    Yup, my shipping prices were set prior to purchase since I use FedEx and can't use the Etsy Calculated Shipping option."
Etsy,3co0b1,littletinypiranha,3,Thu Jul 9 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who ships chainmail and other heavy things, USPS flat rate boxes are without a doubt the cheapest way to ship heavy things."
Etsy,3co0b1,combustionbustion,5,Thu Jul 9 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"Typically I don't fill in the ""shipping price for additional item"" box so (using your example) 9 beer mugs would be 9 times the shipping price for 1 beer mug and then I just refund the shipping overages. Shipping usually gets ""cheaper"" the more items there are to a shipment so it'd be a rare scenario for 9 times the shipping cost to not be able to cover the increase in shipping cost. I usually include a note in the description that I do do combined shipping and to convo me if they want a more accurate quote. To me that's a better idea than asking the customer for more after the fact (or eating the shipping costs).   How are you calculating your shipping costs now?"
Etsy,3co0b1,littletinypiranha,3,Thu Jul 9 14:43:49 2015 UTC,This. Thats the only way I would operate if my items were bulky and expensive to ship.
Etsy,3co0b1,funchy,0,Thu Jul 9 16:19:34 2015 UTC,Ahead of putting my listing out there I take an average of farthest zone cost / closest zone cost. I then use that average as my shipping cost so sometimes it's over and sometimes it's under... The ones that are further sure seem to eat at my margins more than the profit from the closer zones...
Etsy,3co0b1,briekachu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:10:43 2015 UTC,"I meant more in terms of is the shipping priced per item? Do you do flat rate shipping (aka +$0 for each additional item)? That sort of thing.   Maybe you should skew the cost based on where you get the most orders. For examples, if you get 80% of your orders from the farthest zone and only 20% from the closest, then you would price higher than the average. Although, if I were to do it, unless I was very unlikely to get an order from a certain very far location, I would price it based on the furthest location. If it was something like 1 in 10 orders I had to eat some shipping cost then I'd be fine. If I had to eat shipping cost 50% of the time, I would not be happy with that. You just can't keep eating the shipping cost if you're not making much of a profit margin to begin with."
Etsy,3co0b1,briekachu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"Very good point! I'll need to analyze the geographical heat mapping of where orders come from.    For your other point, I don't do flat-rate shipping. There is always an additional cost per heavy item. For my lighter items (i.e under a couple ounces) those are flat-rate and don't cost extra."

Turns out in my situation I found ups ground could ship it for 2/3rds the price usps wanted.   Although there isn't a ups nearby, there are a bunch of authorized ups drop off points such as Staples stores.  Or you can schedule a pickup for an additional fee.  The flipper tools site has a helpful calculator"
Etsy,3co0b1,woodeye,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"I sell glassware as well. My bulk orders mean I have to put them in boxes larger than flat rate and they are usually heavy. When I purchase my glassware they come in sets of 12 or 16 usually. I then, in turn, use the boxes they came in originally to send my large orders. Sometimes if it's 9 glasses then I'd cut the box a bit and modify it so it looks better. I'd wrap this nice box in bubble wrap and some packing peanuts and put it in another box slightly larger and ship it like that.   The last order I shipped like that did cost a bit more than they paid for shipping but it was okay - not something I wasn't okay with eating because of how much they paid for the whole thing."
Etsy,3co0b1,woodeye,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:35 2015 UTC,The only reason I don't use the original box/case the glassware came in is due to the fact I bubble wrap each piece of glassware and then it doesnt fit again in the dividers. How do you accomodate for that or do you not bubble wrap each glass item?
Etsy,3co0b1,lovelyalone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:09:35 2015 UTC,"The reason I reuse the box is because they don't come bubble wrapped when sent to me. I place them back the way they came (in the dividers with no wrapping) and then seal the box up. I then wrap the entire box in bubble wrap and put it in a bigger box (using packing peanuts to fill the empty space, although yesterday I did use that thick paper stuffing I get in my packages sometimes).  When I wrap them all in bubble wrap I find it hard to package them. I find this method safer and more cost effective for the larger orders."

I'm all-for no longer flying this flag on any government property, as it should not be used in any capacity representing official endorsement. However, a private ban seems heavy-handed and simplistic to me. Even a quick google image search shows several of these flags with ""heritage not hate"" emblazoned on them. Symbols mean different things to different people and in different contexts. Somewhat similarly I'd be sad to see a swastika ban."
Etsy,3cm9o6,candyhippie,6,Thu Jul 9 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"Well, etsy just expressing their private views just like any other company. You can still go and buy confederate flag - just not on etsy.

Etsy,3cm9o6,maria_ivanovna,2,Fri Jul 10 06:33:30 2015 UTC,"They're doing a lot more than expressing their views, they're enforcing their views (or rather, enforcing the views they figure will protect their brand from criticism). And they're not just like a physical store -- individual sellers have much more power and responsibility than if Etsy were a physical store. Each seller is its own business, responsible for its own taxes, advertising, supplies, etc. A better analogy would be to say Etsy owns the land upon which these sellers do business, or to see Etsy as a flea market or art show. It's reasonable to expect them to be more lax in ther bans than a physical store, since the products sold on Etsy are less representative of Etsy and more representative of the individual businesses using Etsy as a service. As far as I know, in most cases, it does work that way with Etsy. But it seems that in this case Etsy has been caught up in a bit of a fervor."

Etsy,3cih0h,superjentendo,37,Wed Jul 8 04:07:52 2015 UTC,That went from zero to AWFUL. I don't know who you would report this too- but I would notify Etsy and PayPal if you can even tho the seller refunded you. That HAS to be against policy
Etsy,3cih0h,Candymoanium,14,Wed Jul 8 04:25:13 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely have never had this type of issue with Etsy. I am pretty uncomfortable and hoping he can't access any of my info.

Etsy,3cih0h,PoppySiddal,13,Wed Jul 8 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"Upvoting for visibility. So sorry this happened to you.  I just had a lovely conversation with an Etsy seller, I have a ring on layaway with him. After the ""hope you're well, how was your fourth"" niceties we got into a discussion about some of the stranger transactions he's had online.   Nothing crazy, the worst was a woman who tried to pay the final layaway payment (and claim ownership) of someone else's item. When he cancelled the payment and sent her money back she opened a case against him even though the item belonged to someone else and the listing clearly stated layaway payment/please do not buy.  The last thing his convo to me said was ""you have no idea what some people online will do.""  Now I do. Yikes. Thanks for the warning."

Etsy,3cih0h,hannah-christine,4,Wed Jul 8 14:40:39 2015 UTC,you can figure it out with a reverse image search - it a reseller - and they have one item listed

Etsy,3cih0h,AyKayKay,5,Wed Jul 8 16:24:44 2015 UTC,I'll try to figure it out I guess. But I don't understand why we're choosing to protect the identity of an Etsy seller who asked for naked pictures from a buyer? What's the reason for that?
Etsy,3cih0h,skrunkle,3,Wed Jul 8 16:28:48 2015 UTC,I agree.

Etsy,3cih0h,hedera3,9,Wed Jul 8 04:32:01 2015 UTC,I would probably make a community post as well. Usually when shit hits the fan in the forums (out in the open) businesses tend to take a closer eye on things and may institute a new contact funnel for demands such as this or along those lines. You might even have your story end up on a popular blog somewhere.  About how many sales does this person have? Shop open date?
Etsy,3cih0h,Seamstome,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:47 2015 UTC,I will PM you.

Looking at it now, he appears to have only one item in the shop. Pretty red flag. I didn't pay attention to this previously."
Etsy,3cih0h,locustandplum,4,Wed Jul 8 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"Sent a PM.  Meh. Usually people throw out feeler products to test the waters. Don't know what those 2 sells are from though. Seems if he was just gathering names/addresses then there would be neg feedback. Maybe those 2 orders are still unfulfilled.  Hopefully he gets a swift boot to the nuts. ETSY should really clean house some day. It's an alibaba product for anyone interested.  EDIT: I do know what those 2 sells are from. The only listing he has, has been the only purchases that were made. What I meant was. He may actually be a legit seller (reseller though) and actually send products. While being a part-time thirsty dude on the side or a full blown nut case."

Etsy,3cih0h,k80k80k80,-13,Wed Jul 8 10:36:50 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who finds this hilarious?  The awkward accent the messages get from the weird punctuation, repetition and grammar, the clownish unsexiness, the absolute silliness of thinking one could possibly ever extort naked pictures out of a stranger through etsy, in spite of documentation and policy. It's just so comically desperate. I wouldn't be surprised if the user was just a jimmy-rustling troll. I mean report it for sure, as it's unprofessional and doesn't make Etsy look good at all, but 'harassment'? The request was only made once. Harassment is ""aggressive pressure or intimidation."" You can't actually have found this intimidating.  EDIT: On second-read, it doesn't look like he was even trying to extort. He assured you you'd get a refund regardless before asking for nudes. I love how you told him you're married, as though you'd reconsider if you were single! XD"
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,12,Wed Jul 8 14:07:38 2015 UTC,A business exchange should not involve anything except currency. This is inappropriate and disrespectful. It's also poor business practice.  OP is clearly uncomfortable. Not funny at all.
Etsy,3cih0h,k80k80k80,-9,Wed Jul 8 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"It's true, pressure and discomfort in sensitive places can be unfunny, know what I mean? Say no more!"
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,10,Wed Jul 8 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"Threatened? No. Highly annoyed plus inappropriate behavior from a shop on a platform I've been using for 5 years with no previous issues? Um, yeah.  It's not funny when someone has your address, name and any financial information. If I laughed this off and didn't threaten him or hold my ground being stern this ""jimmy rustling troll"" could possibly use that information causing me further headache and annoyance. Sorry I don't think it's hilarious that my identity or bank accounts could have potentially been at stake.  Harassment is continued or unwanted actions and demands. My phone was alerted 5 times within an hour from someone I DON'T KNOW asking me to respond. Common Etsy or ANY common cancelation request should go thru with little to no communication. I understand if someone wants to know why I'm canceling by asking initially, but multiple times? It's not the sellers concern if I don't want the product. I have the right to cancel. I don't condone someone assuming they can ask me or any person for nude photos. I don't know this person, and I'm offended."
Etsy,3cih0h,k80k80k80,-10,Wed Jul 8 14:47:43 2015 UTC,"Threatened? No.    That's good, then.   Highly annoyed plus inappropriate behavior from a shop on a platform I've been using for 5 years with no previous issues?    If this is the first time anything like this has happened in five whole years... why get so annoyed? It's not a recurring problem. Wouldn't severe annoyance be the appropriate reaction to this being a recurring problem?   It's not funny when someone has your address, name and any financial information.   Anyone can get that same information any time you make a purchase. Do you honestly think this person is more of a threat because he messaged you weirdly? Wouldn't someone with the ability and intent to do something nefarious with your information probably just keep quiet so as not to self-incriminate?  But then you also said you're not threatened. So I don't know what's going on here.   If I laughed this off and didn't threaten him or hold my ground being stern this ""jimmy rustling troll"" could possibly use that information causing me further headache and annoyance.   As I said, report it. Why waste time threatening him? Just report. I don't see how your emotional state would stop this person from doing what you fear he may do. He could just as easily get angry and seek to damage you in revenge for your strong emotional reaction. But I think that's equally unlikely.   Sorry I don't think it's hilarious that my identity or bank accounts could have potentially been at stake.   We both know that I did not say or imply that potential identity theft (or etc) has anything whatsoever to do with what makes the situation funny.   What information does this guy have that other sellers you've purchased from don't have?   Harassment is continued or unwanted actions and demands.  My phone was alerted 5 times within an hour from someone I DON'T KNOW asking me to respond.    The majority of the messages came before the weird request and were business related, and you didn't ask the person to stop contacting you until after the weird request. You also initiated the interaction by purchasing and cancelling, so I don't think the fact that you don't know the guy is relevant here at all. I think you're really reaching here.   Common Etsy or ANY common cancelation request should go thru with little to no communication.    Ok. The number of messages was inconvenient. That doesn't make it ""harassment"" though. Why throw the word around like this?   I have the right to cancel.    And it was cancelled, correct? And if you had reported the guy earlier, for holding back on the refund for a few messages, I'm sure Etsy would have stepped in and taken care of it with or without his cooperation.   I don't condone someone assuming they can ask me or any person for nude photos.    They can, though. It's just a very silly and desperate thing to do.   I don't know this person, and I'm offended.    That's up to you, really. I don't know either of you, and I'm not offended."
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,14,Wed Jul 8 15:06:37 2015 UTC,... why get so annoyed?   Because it's a textbook case of sexual harassment.
Etsy,3cih0h,dewprisms,-13,Wed Jul 8 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"Not all textbooks should be trusted.   You're also taking what I said out of context. I asked, ""Why get so annoyed?"" in response to:  ""Highly annoyed plus inappropriate behavior from a shop on a platform I've been using for 5 years with no previous issues?""  The point is: why would the fact that this has never happened before in five years increase annoyance?"
Etsy,3cih0h,Krysta-Khaos,11,Wed Jul 8 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"The definition of sexual harassment: harassment in a workplace, or other professional or social situation, involving the making of unwanted sexual advances or obscene remarks."
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,-12,Wed Jul 8 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"That's not from a textbook, that's from a google search. :P   It includes 'harassment' in the definition: the definition assumes it's been established that a behavior is harassment, and then specifies whether the harassment is sexual harassment. What's in question in our situation is not whether it was sexual, but whether it was harassment.  The definition you provided does not address this.  That said, I'm sure there are some reaching, techinical definitions of sexual harassment that fit this situation perfectly, which is precisely a part of what makes this funny: it's such a pitiful, clownish and harmless attempt as to render calling it 'sexual harassment' (with all the implicit seriousness, fear and retaliatory bustling around) pointless."
Etsy,3cih0h,Krysta-Khaos,14,Wed Jul 8 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"It is not harmless. This person has her address and personal information. But even if he didn't, I still wouldn't consider this harmless."
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,-12,Wed Jul 8 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"It is not harmless.   Indeed, it has used up a lot more of my time than I initially planned! I should be listing.  [Edit to keep up with your edit, nerr]   This person has her address and personal information.   What information does this person have that every other person she's purchased from does not have?  In other words, so what?   Is he going to mail her a bomb from Indiastan because he is stupid and likes boobs?  (Edit again: Also w00! I just now got my 100th sale! Not bad for 2.5 months, eh? I'd been sitting maddeningly at 99 for three days. This is a good omen.)"
Etsy,3cih0h,syringemedic,11,Wed Jul 8 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"Is he going to mail her a bomb from Indiastan   Oh nice, not only do you tell the OP how she should be feeling in reaction to this situation, but you're being racist too. That's lovely."
Etsy,3cih0h,candyhippie,2,Wed Jul 8 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"Even though I disagree with so many other things you said, let's focus on the statement that it ""wasn't harassment"", well there isn't a  ""creepy guy asking for nudes which is highly inappropriate and unprofessional business practice"" button is there? What else was she supposed to report it as?"
Etsy,3clm3u,BeckerHollow,2,Wed Jul 8 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"Would copying the listing help cut down on some of it?   For example, when I make 8 makeup bags in 8 different fabrics, I'll make one listing from scratch and then copy it for the next 7 items. That way all I have to change are the pictures, the color/fabric descriptions, variations choices and tags/materials used. I don't use calculated shipping though so I don't know if the dimensions would copy over, but it was just a thought."
Etsy,3clm3u,cherryfristado,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:38 2015 UTC,"I do copy, but I still have to change the dimensions and pictures. On similar items they might be a few ounces different and a few fractions of an inch different in size, but they look different enough that I have to reenter every time."

Etsy,3clm3u,briekachu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why you'd be doing it three times.   You enter it once into Etsy's shipping calculator, or whatever carrier you want to use, then on the listing page put the shipping costs you determined from that page. If your items are of similar weights and sizes (just very unique designs hence the different listings) then you could have a standard rate for each size bracket rather than keep entering them individually."
Etsy,3clm3u,briekachu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:06:02 2015 UTC,I list it in the item description as well because we make wood products for the home. People need the dimensions and weight. If I only enter it into Etsy's shipping calendar it isn't displayed anywhere for the customer to see.
Etsy,3ckwwl,mewk69,7,Wed Jul 8 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"I really like your stuff. I think your style is cool and you have a lot of potential on Etsy. However your items are infringing on copyright. I've seen LOTS of firefly stuff get pulled before, and Disney owns Star Wars now so they will be on the prowl for that, and Fallout gets pulled pretty hard too.   I've seen you around this subreddit so I'm sure you've seen all of us harping about copyright infringement. I don't think I need to lecture you on it, but I hope you do realize that you're profiting off of other people's work and it's illegal."
Etsy,3ckwwl,swxw,-2,Wed Jul 8 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"In trying my best to be decent about it. Gradually working original non-fanbased stuff in there too. It always helps to have something great to base a print on, so I started by pulling ideas from the things I love. At least it's got the ideas flowing, I'm sure there's lots of inspired and original concepts just waiting around the corner for me. Thanks for the kind words about my style too. It's hard to see a thread of continuity when it's your own stuff. You just gotta know it's there... somewhere."
Etsy,3ckwwl,swxw,5,Wed Jul 8 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard and it's nice to see an honest response like yours. I admire you and your continued effort to produce original content, and I think when you do start producing original works regularly to replace the infringing items (because I'm confident you will), you'll be so much more satisfied with your shop. I've seen some really great astronomy-related artwork do really well. With your design style I think astronomy posters would look fantastic. I could also see your style meshing really well with prints of vintage automobiles and collectibles (without any branding so you're not infringing). You have some posters of firefly quotes, maybe try looking for classic quotes that are now public domain. You'd be surprised at what is really famous that is now old enough to be public domain."

Etsy,3chsgz,maria_ivanovna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the app asks you how would they want to pay: cash or credit. If it's cash -- there is no xtra fees, if it's credit - you have to either use etsy reader or input numbers manually. Then etsy will charge you payment processing fee.

Then all of a sudden my traffic dropped. Then I started getting warnings from instagram. I made a post about it here on r/etsy once and other users pointed out to me that instagram specifically coaches you on how to use their service for business right on their page- which is exactly what I was doing. I guess they only care about you if you're a big company like Taco Bell or Dreamworks or Capital One or any of the other promoted images I've seen on there lately. It's frustrating. It used to be so good for building an audience.  :-/"

Check em out at 》themothflock.etsy.com 《""  I've been doing that since last fall with no problems but this time when I did it, my instagram started acting like it was frozen. Then I refreshed my page and my latest post wasn't showing up. A new screen loaded where it said that my post was removed for ""hurting the community"" and to check the community guidelines, to which it gave a link. (The link took me to a server error page). I tried posting again and the post was removed instantaneously with no warning. I tried a few days later to the same result. Then I removed my shop link and it worked. I haven't tried again since because I feel like I have a target on my back now and I don't want to get deleted and lose my 2500 follower fanbase I've worked really hard to build. And it frustrates me because I see people doing the same thing all the time with no problems plus explicit spam pages staying up for months with no recourse.   Someone on here told me that someone must have reported me for spam, which pissed me off because I always made one post every other day or so. I have an app that shows which of my posts build the most engagement, my followers/unfollowers at a glance, and blockers. Right after the incident, I had my first blocker. It was some random person I'd never seen nor interacted with before. I'm assuming they reported me and now I'm walking on egg shells to keep instagram from bringing down the banhammer. It's annoying."

I've been doing it for a while now and people really enjoy looking at my products and specials I have going on and seeing new products come out as well as behind the scenes type stuff.

I didn't even have to ask for the help.  another service (paywithpenny) never responded to my application so I feel like right out of the gates they showed how little they cared to receive any business. their customer service and responsiveness might be overloaded so I wouldn't trust my business with them."

You can get sued and when they do that, they don't simply take a portion of your sales. They will take it all. They will try to take your computer, your car, your house if you ""design"" the stuff at home. They have more lawyers than you do. Come up with original designs and you'll be good. It will take work."
Etsy,3ciunn,locustandplum,9,Wed Jul 8 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Also, if your first thought when building your shop is trying to find ways around being sued over the things you're making, then you're definitely doing it wrong."
Etsy,3ciunn,dearwilde,8,Wed Jul 8 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"You will likely get a cease and desist for your items. Sports teams regularly pull listings (including colleges) and Jurassic Park items have been pulled before. Warner Bros owns Jurassic Park and they clear out their items pretty frequently.  Getting an LLC does not protect you from litigation. It just protects your personal assets from becoming eligible during litigation. It actually legitimizes the claims more because you're acknowledging you're a business just like anything else, so you lose the sympathy card for ""oh, but i'm just a tiny person doing this in my bedroom part time"" that some people play.  What an LLC does is it separates the business assets from your personal assets, and only if you actually use it correctly. You have to completely separate your finances, you'll need an operating agreement, you'll have to pay all your taxes on time (self employment tax is not fun) and show that this is a legit business for the LLC to stand. If you start paying your personal bills out of your business account directly (or something else that blurs the line between business/personal) a judge could easily find your LLC invalid and then when Warner Bros. comes after you they could see your assets as everything you own instead of just what your business owns and revenue it has made. If a lawyer ever finds this thread, they can easily get your LLC thrown out.  That's another point...they will come after you for revenue, not just profit. And if you live with another person and use their computer or things to work on this they will get drug into it as well.  These companies don't care about ""big enough"". To maintain their trademarks they must enforce their ownership of them, so they must actively patrol and remove items that infringe upon their trademarks. You will likely get a cease and desist and you'll have to remove the item and your etsy account will get noted. Usually 3 strikes and you're banned for life. Every day many items are removed from etsy because of trademark and copyright holders sending in valid DMCA notices for takedown. And as Etsy has gone public it's only going to become more frequent.  However, this is all moot because you should understand that you have no right to use those things and doing so is wrong and illegal and starts your business off on the wrong foot. If you want to have a successful business that gives you good returns you should find an idea that is unique and different that you can execute well without worry. Otherwise, I will have no sympathy for you when the time comes that you're removed."
Etsy,3ciunn,courtneyj,3,Wed Jul 8 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's worth the risk. The chances of you getting sued would be low, but the chances of your listings and shop being taken down and removed from Etsy is rather high. It takes quite a bit of effort to start up a shop and have it running successfully (photos, descriptions, shipping, stock, inventory, marketing, etc.). It's a lot of work to throw away. The memes are probably fine, and the creators of Rick and Morty probably wouldn't come after you but I would stay away from anything else you've listed that's copyrighted or trademarked. I think sports teams get hit pretty heavily as well as calvin and hobbes and movies like Jurassic Park."

Other option would be to get permission from the companies to use their logos with your products."
Etsy,3ciunn,swxw,3,Wed Jul 8 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live, you may or may not need to register your business. If the only reason you are starting an LLC and a business account is to avoid liability in the case of getting sued, I think you should just try to avoid getting sued in the first place. For example, if you were worried you were gonna go to jail for a crime, maybe you shouldn't commit the crime in the first place, you know?   This may not be what you want to hear but I don't think it's worth it to start an Etsy store if the risks are high that you will be shut down."
Etsy,3ch3vo,kalashnikitty,3,Tue Jul 7 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"Hello Amy,   First things first - get rid of any Disney stuff. You generally want to stay away from anything that doesn't belong to you. Disney especially will get your shop shut down. You'd probably be best taking ""Pinterest"" or anything similar out of your tags as well.   I think you have too many watermarks on your art. I get what you're trying to do - but as a buyer it too distracting - as a designer I could remove your current watermark from half of your designs anyways.   Your policies could definitely be more fleshed out. You could expand your welcome messages - promote your Instagram or ""Find me on Pinterest,"" etc. - whatever. It just seems plain.   https://www.etsy.com/listing/239388185/tiny-jellyfish-watercolor-art-print  Looking at this print listing. You could expand keywords definitely. I don't know why you have 'feathers' as a keyword, but I'd remove that one - I don't know if you just repeated keywords from your feathers listing.   ""nautical art"" ""ocean art"" ""blue sea"" ""ocean art"" ""seascape painting"" ""ocean illustration"" etc. Your keywords are what is going to get you found so you'll need to spend a lot of time working on finding the right ones. I don't know if you've checked out https://marmalead.com/app/ but that's the current fad to look at keywords.   For listing descriptions I think you have more text than most would have at this point - I commend you - but you need to become a salesperson when you describe it and make the buyer reading it realize they need it in their life.   All in all it's a great start for being open so little time. Keep going and I'm sure you'll have a successful shop. (: Good luck."
Etsy,3ch3vo,briekachu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all this advice! It's very helpful. I'm hoping you can answer some follow up questions then.  Regarding the Disney stuff- I was cautious about it as well but saw tons of other shops with Disney prints, paintings, etc. that have loads of sales. How are they doing it?   Watermarks I understand... I thought it was a bit distracting too but I get really discouraged seeing my art I've posted elsewhere directly copied or reposted. Should I just stick to having my signature on it even though it's an easy thing to delete?  As for the tags... I'm definitely needing help there. Thank you. It's awkward trying to describe the art in short tags, but I get what you're saying since that's what the buyer will be typing in.  Lol about making the buyer NEED IT. I'll try to spice it up!  Thank you so much for your feedback, it's above and beyond what I thought I'd receive."
Etsy,3ch3vo,briekachu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:34:10 2015 UTC,I'm glad it's helpful!  For those listings you see - they are all illegal - they are taking the risk of their shop being shut down (or worse). I've heard of some people being sued directly from Disney and them taking everything from them. It's really just a bad spot to be in. So it's better to avoid it altogether and have a safe and responsible shop.   I completely understand the watermark thing. I think the solution to that is mock ups. Not only is it going to make your work look more professional but it makes it really hard to print off. Then you can have your second image the frontal view with the watermarks.   Imgur

First off, this print is IP infringement and that's a huge no-no. Also, this is a PDF, right? So why is the listing title the same as the physical prints? I see that it's in a different section than the rest, but you should still make it clear in the title that it's an instant download and not a physical print. What's the reason for it being a printable, anyway? Why, if the seller can print all the other listings, can you not print this one?  I'm just a bit put off thinking that I can buy a finished print (from the same seller!) for $6, or a PDF I have to pay to get printed myself for $5.  Edit: I also went back and checked out your shipping prices. They seem quite high for what you're selling. Just to make sure, I looked at a few of my favorite art shops and I see shipping for 8x10s to be between $2.25 and $4.50. Even $5 seems rare and quite high."

I don't know if I'm being dumb, but I really don't understand how they're ""getting away with it"".  As for the other items, I'm considering making them print at home. It's more expensive than it should be to ship and produce these items. I looked at FedEx and USPS and that's how expensive it is to ship. I don't know how these other people are doing it. By the time I get the packing material, tracking, etc, the actual cost is more than what I have listed. I see a lot of successful shops with print at home items...

Etsy,3cevnj,kronleathergoods,2,Tue Jul 7 11:01:15 2015 UTC,Your descriptions and photos are great! The only thing I would work on would be your tags. Think as if you are searching for a coin purse. What would you type in?
Etsy,3cevnj,PlannersInPink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:03:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback!  Yes, I will work on the tags. Have to take some time do to this brainstorming.  By tags you mean both in title and the ones you add in the bottom of the page when listing an item? ...or only bottom.  It is so exciting to have an open shop so, mainly, every hour of my spare time is into this. It is a very nice experience, even if I do not have any sales , hopefully soon, it is nice to watch the evolution when you make some changes.  Thanks!  Mircea"
Etsy,3cevnj,PlannersInPink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:50:36 2015 UTC,The ones at the bottom! Etsy is very exciting. I can't wait to see you post about having your first sale.

Etsy,3cevnj,MattsyKun,2,Tue Jul 7 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"I like the variety of backgrounds in the photos. They're all very simple, different, but cohesive at the same time. My two suggestions would be to have more product listings posted. More lists mean more people will see your items, and the more it shows up in etsy searches. Promote on more pages, facebook, deviantart, or other craft or leather specific websites."
Etsy,3cevnj,armoreddragon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback!  I have in plan to post some products pretty soon, so much to do till then.

Etsy,3cf370,aycockdesigns,6,Tue Jul 7 12:29:09 2015 UTC,"Treasuries used to appear on the front page, so could really be useful in getting traffic to your shop. Nowadays, the front page is based on your own favourites etc, so there isn't the same impact!"
Etsy,3cf370,randomlygen,2,Tue Jul 7 14:05:37 2015 UTC,I don't find Treasuries very helpful in neither marketing or exposure.  I have quite a few of my items featured in Treasuries but never had any sales from it. I agree that Pinterest is a lot more effective.
Etsy,3cf370,lovelyalone,2,Thu Jul 9 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"It used to be that the biggest feature of the Etsy homepage was a Treasury. (back when there was an actual front page, not this dashboard-style one). Anyone could make one, and if yours got popular enough (votes/likes), it could show up on the front page. They were rotated out every couple hours, but it was FANTASTIC exposure for people whose products were featured, and the person who created it.  Nowadays, I'm not sure about Treasuries in general. I've been a shopper on Etsy for years, and a seller for considerably less, but I never really got into Treasuries. I haven't made my own since before I opened my shop (which has been closed for about a year, reopening soon, hence the upcoming use of the past tense), but my items occasionally did make it into other people's Treasuries.  I always saw a spike of traffic the day it was created, and I averaged 1 sale per feature. (usually not the item that was featured, though, but as a vintage seller, that's not necessarily a bad thing)  My guess for successful Treasury marketing would be to treat it like a Pinterest Board. (I have very limited knowledge of Pinterest, so ignore this if it's way off base)  Pick a theme - anything from an artsy mood or color scheme to something as simple as ""16 shops that are doing Christmas In July sales."" Include one of your items. I'd imagine creating Treasuries regularly would also drive traffic."
Etsy,3cf370,spacev1king,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's helpful. I guess I could totally see Etsy somehow working that into their algorithm of how often people see your postings... based off how much you ""participate"" in all their things including treasuries. They (Etsy, the company) seem to be like that about stuff."
Etsy,3cf370,spacev1king,3,Tue Jul 7 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew more about it, to be honest, but I'm glad I could help. I miss the old homepage, haha."
Etsy,3cf370,candyhippie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:42:16 2015 UTC,Include one of your items.   Unfortunately I don't think it's possible to include your own items in a treasury.
Etsy,3cf370,spacev1king,2,Tue Jul 7 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Really? I could have sworn it used to be. Like I said, I haven't made one in years, so maybe the rules changed, or I'm just remembering it wrong."
Etsy,3cf370,candyhippie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:47 2015 UTC,Weeell I just tried it to make sure and it turns out I was wrong! Seems I was confusing treasury lists with regular lists. Neato.

Etsy,3cf370,vintagekaren,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"Treasuries are a nice way to highlight other sellers' products and give them more views ... and hopefully sales. And the good karma comes around when other sellers include your items in their treasuries. I can base one or two sales on being included in a treasury.  I find them fun to create, but time-consuming. Would love to hear others' experiences with them."
Etsy,3cf370,WheresMyWine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"I am a huge 'karma' advocate, however, I don't believe something time consuming like this would be worth it if it only amounts to a couple sales. Not sure what time frame you got those 1-2 sales. If this is all there is to treasuries, I'd rather spend more time creating my craft products, and researching new ways to market towards my potential customers. I get what you're saying though. When running your shop like a business, there is often not times for 'fun' as it all ends up pertaining to 'work' (or to your shop). At the same time, I do have fun / and enjoy doing everything it takes to run the business, you can get what I mean! It's quite time consuming itself to find time to post in treasuries that have nowhere close to the traffic as Pinterest or similar (it seems)."

I wanted to go there so bad but I didn't think I would be good enough :) Your illustrations are adorable! I'm definitely going to have to buy something soon. I would love to hear more about your approach to the copyright problems, I have already seen my work traced and I have only had my designs up a couple months. What do you do when you see your work copied? So far I have contacted the people directly and that seems to scare them enough, but I am waiting for the day that it's not that easy. Thanks so much for posting this."
Etsy,3cat50,vintagekaren,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"thank you so much! RISD is awesome! no one is good when they come in as a freshman -- but they learn to be good!   answers to your questions:  When I see my work copied, I usually consult with a lawyer and/or hire one to handle it directly. DMCA copyright notices can also be effective on other websites, but I feel Etsy has not taken the copyright of individual artists as seriously as they take corporate trademark infringements, so I've never experienced assistance or proactivity from contacting them about it.  Seeing my work copied so relentlessly (even by other artists) has really taken a toll on me - the cause of a lot of anxiety and sadness. So, it generally makes me less stressed and is handled professionally and swiftly if a lawyer is involved, even though something as simple as the back and forth on a cease and desist notice can cost more than I may comfortably be able to afford.  Also, if you care about the copyright of your work, I strongly suggest writing a letter in protest of this legislation -- more info here. This orphan works legislation would require all work to be formally registered with the copyright office to be protected in any way (i.e. no common law copyright) which obviously is disastrous to small businesses and artists who don't have the budget to formally register every thing they create."

I've never had to deal with the copyright issue but, like you, I would be outraged if someone stole my designs! Glad you go after them.  For me, because I sell one-of-a-kind vintage stuff, besides good photos, thorough descriptions are key. They must include material content, measurements, details about wear or flaws, etc. It can take a long time, but I think it's worth the effort.  All the best."

Etsy,3cat50,imachocolatewaffle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:50 2015 UTC,what do you do when competitors obviously rip off your style? can you do anything legally?
Etsy,3cat50,The_Paul_Alves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:47:03 2015 UTC,I usually consult with a lawyer & get their opinion. it varies case by case. I can spot a copy of my work from a mile away but there isn't always something that can be done. sometimes you just have to sort of live with the feeling that people will steal from you no matter what. it is the absolute hardest part of putting original artwork out there. at times it is a real struggle just to see the point of it all when people are so relentless and ruthless.

Etsy,3ce4e6,skunkhaus,2,Tue Jul 7 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"Trick to Twitter is 100% having a legitimate Twitter that is more than just promotion. It takes years to build though. It's one of those, if you have one you might as well use it occasionally to promote... Or if you have a business that genuinely interests masses of people, great. Otherwise don't bother."
Etsy,3ce4e6,fairycakeshake,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:55:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  You need to follow an 80:20 rule, or even a 90:10 rule with twitter, WRT item listings.  The vast majority of your twitter feed should be dedicated to things that are helpful, funny, interesting, and/or delightful, independent of what you're trying to promote.  I'm very successful on Twitter (I manage many accounts), and I credit my success to never being spammy (and a few other tricks and tools I picked up along the way).  Used right, twitter is a way more powerful and far-reaching platform than Facebook or pinterest, and its clickable links make it an easier segue into a call-to-action than Instagram."

(:  I think some people are just going to complain no matter what. You mean the weathered dollars are actually weathered? No way! I think your response is fine. If he's not happy with the dollars then have him pay to ship them back and refund them. Some people just want to cause a ruckus - sorry you're dealing with that. I wouldn't tell them ""I no longer want to do business with you"" because that might just make the situation worse. If he does happen to order again you can just cancel his order and tell him when it comes to it instead of making more drama in the current situation."
Etsy,3cbz9v,briekachu,2,Mon Jul 6 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's the listing alright.   I've actually had very few people complain, I think this is the third person, might be the only actual customer.   I've had a no refunds / no exchanges since ~Day 1. Not going to cave in on any policy, especially for a buyer like this one that blatantly lies to try to get something for free.  I think you're right on the whole ""Don't ever shop here again"" thing. Any idea what I should put in the order cancelation if the problem ever arises? I've had to cancel a few orders already, mostly because people don't read and then submit again without reading my message on how to properly order __. I don't know if Etsy has some kind of thing with sellers that have order cancelations.  I've learned to deal with these type of people for the most part, mostly because I got to learn a lot of the tricks people like to pull. I've seen a lot of replies that I keep in my head as guides."

Just say that you are glad you found them and reference your listing that the items aren't going to be identical.  Since you don't mass produce them it will not be the same.   Great stuff, BTW!

My response to his ""I didn't see it in the box"" would have been a curt ""Well, then I'm glad there does not seem to be a problem.""   In your reply to his further problems I'd probably slip in ""As stated on my main page, this product is hand-weathered and distressed, so variation and irregularity are inherent features of the design, not defects. No two will ever be identical.""   If he continues to complain, I would offer to exchange the offending items, but only if he pays for shipping.

Etsy,3cbz9v,hedera3,2,Mon Jul 6 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"People don't read, all caps won't help.  They also can't visualize and need to see pictures.  Have the different weathering types be different listings, with the appropriate pic for each style.  This way they can see what they are getting, instead of having to try to imagine the difference between ""wrinkly"" and ""not super wrinkly""  You can link to other pages inside your shop, so you can still link to the other options."

I make throw pillows/cushions from modern and vintage Hmong Hill Tribe fabric.   The Hmong hand-weave cotton and hemp on wooden looms in the villages, dye fabric using indigo plant dye  (many Hmong women hands are permanently stained) and other organic methods, and use wax batik, either hand applied or with wooden and metal stamps that the men of the village create to add traditional lines and designs.  Hmong have made fabric this way for centuries although the techniques are slowly being lost to time, hemp has mostly been replaced with cotton, and due to tourism in particular many villages have moved away from the time consuming traditional methods in favor of modern methods.  I only have a small range at the moment but I have some beautiful light vintage hemp fabric ready to be made into pillows in the next few days that I'm quite excited about!"

Etsy,3cb3m5,femininefabrication,0,Thu Jul 16 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I opened this shop up less than 24 hours ago!  My store is https://www.etsy.com/shop/AOIncorporated  I really love sewing and these bloomerumi's have just been the greatest thing to make and sell to people. Everything is custom order to your size and I work around whatever you might need/want. I finish off all edges with a serger, invisible pockets are on the side, and hood is lined with cute patterns.  This is currently geared toward the ladies, but a mens version is currently in the works! Just need a bit of side money to fund it before I can offer that to the public next ^"
Etsy,3cct3s,eitakmai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:25:03 2015 UTC,Fill out your policies. What's your return policy? How do you package your items?  You need better tags on your items.  Read the Etsy sellers handbook.
Etsy,3cct3s,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:29:35 2015 UTC,Try a different backdrop for your photos. The marble slab on the hardwood floors is distracting. Also consider taking more photographs of each piece. I personally wouldn't order a necklace unless I saw it on a model. Even though you list the length I like to know how it fits on someone. I would also be interested in seeing a photo that includes the clasp. Over all the items are cute I think you just need to work on how you present them.
Etsy,3cb3g4,Kirsty3,2,Mon Jul 6 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"In the Etsy Forums last year I had not heard of anyone having luck with Christmas in July sales. In 2014 many had stated that it hadn't worked the previous year so they were declining to do it again. I hadn't read much about it this year, though.  My sales are slow starting in May. I opened April of 2014, and rarely get many sales in the summer. Last summer my Ebay sales (household items/clothes) were very low, too. I'm not sure if it's a summer thing or not.  I'm not convinced that Etsy shoppers are looking for ""sales"". Yes, everyone wants a good deal, but those going on Etsy to shop are going for something unique. If they wanted a good deal they'd bid on Ebay.  Good luck! If you do the sale, let us know in August how it went. :)"
Etsy,3cb3g4,sirius_moonlight,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"I have only been selling on Etsy since May 2015... but I can tell you one thing. Depending on what type of item it is, it will do better based on the season.  If you sell knit scarves, good luck selling a lot during July! If you only sell wedding stuff, I'm sure you'll see some stuff drop during Winter months because weddings are most popular during the Spring & Summer times.  I don't see anyone searching the word ""christmas"" during the month of July, so I don't think that would work. Also, like /u/sirius_moonlight said... not sure that anyone actually searches for sales... People know what they're looking for... and whatever looks best and is exactly what they imagined or even better, they won't care as much about sales going on.  I've also been in sales in general for a long time. Sales will always fluctuate. Sometimes you'll feel like you've done everything to make things perfect, and it's just not working at that moment... In time, it will come back around again. There are natural cycles indeed.   One last thing: Don't try to fix what works. HOWEVER, tweaking things that aren't quite cutting it is essential also!"
Etsy,3cb3g4,aycockdesigns,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:38:39 2015 UTC,My sales slowed down in June even though my views/favorites are up for June. I'm hoping it is because more people are vacationing and are just busy with life. I'm really looking forward to things picking up though!  good luck!
Etsy,3cb3g4,locustandplum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"I've been on etsy for a few years now, and the summer tends to slow down a bit. I think for a lot of sellers June and July are where their sales tend to dip the most."
Etsy,3cb3g4,trailscrafts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:47:26 2015 UTC,I have two Etsy stores and they are both slow right now too. I did offer my Facebook friends a 15% discount and two folks bought stuff. But mostly I'm just focusing on finding things (I sell vintage stuff) and getting them listed...sales will pick up :)
Etsy,3cb3g4,vintagekaren,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"I sell through Etsy and with better luck  through another online website (Shoppe by scoutmob, which markets aggressively, but takes a huge cut) and my sales have slowed down through both sites. Who knows- maybe people are vacationing? I do have a summer sale on my shop announcement page, but so far no one has used it - I'm thinking they probably don't go through my storefront."
Etsy,3cc7wp,Mei-sshi,2,Mon Jul 6 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"I love the green Watercolor Art in your shop.   Your pictures are nice. Descriptions are very fleshed out, as is most of your policy page. I think your keywords are weak and I would recommend some kind of title for your art. More than just ""Printable Watercolor Art, Illustration, Abstract Drip Paint Wall Art, Green, Blue Flowers, Leaves"" Because when I look at your shop and see only ""Printable Flower Art Illus.."" that could be any number of listings.  That's just a personal preference I guess though.   Mainly you need to add more listings.   You have very nice photo lighting! For the custom Moleskin sketchbooks I find the first picture kind of distracting (especially since I'm seeing it so small in your shop). Even though the second images on the sketchbook listings are plain I prefer them to the first.  Edit:// I lied - there's something I wanted to add. There's no mention of size on the watercolor listing. ""What are you buying: a high quality DIGITAL image, a print you can further on get printed in high quality."" I get this information for what I'm getting. Is it in 300 DPI (I assume it would be but that's something I'd mention). What size is it (in inches) when you send it to me? Is it pre-formatted to a certain size? If I wasn't photo savvy could I request it to be sent to me in a certain formatted size? Just some things to think about."

Etsy,3cc7wp,littletinypiranha,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"From your pictures of the white sketchbook, it doesn't look like you're using the hard cover moleskines (unless I'm wrong). The ones you're using look like they still have a bit of flex and, from my experience, all the paper cover ones are flexible. The ones that I would consider to be ""hard cover"" are the ones that are rigid, like these ones. You might want to change that so that you're customers aren't expecting the leathery, hard-cover moleskines."

Etsy,3cavh3,skunkhaus,0,Mon Jul 6 14:25:51 2015 UTC,I just started using GA last week.  It's never reported the same numbers.  What should the BR be set to?
Etsy,3cavh3,skunkhaus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"Really, set your bounce rate to whatever you feel is appropriate.  It may not always match up with Etsy, but it will give you an idea of what's going on on your page, how long people are looking at it, where they came from (referring pages, search terms) etc.  One thing you can do is track over time to see whether the Google analytics visits are at least somewhat proportional to what Etsy is reporting.   Just take a peek every once in a while to get a gut feel for it."

Etsy,3c8fww,fuckinintents,2,Mon Jul 6 00:31:43 2015 UTC,Make what people want.   Sell what no one else can or few others do.  Find a niche.   Be prepared to work very hard.   Treat your customers well.   Plan on not striking it rich.
Etsy,3c8fww,tom8o,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like as long as you can maintain being a little different than the other candle shops, whether its price, packaging, or scents you should be able to make sales!"
Etsy,3c8fww,Audaciousdrea,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"As someone that buys candles online,  I'd say there is definitely a market for it! It couldn't hurt to try!  Just be sure there is something unique about your store/product."
Etsy,3c8fww,Christypaints,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"I’m actually a candle seller on Etsy and can say that Etsy is quite saturated with them. I started my shop back in May and have had a few sales since then. If you’re patient and willing to put the time and effort in I’m sure you could do well but as is the case with a lot of the things on Etsy you need to be capable at the SEO.   Since there are so many candles it’s really hard to get noticed unless you can find a way to stand out and are willing to spend a lot of time figuring out what titles for your products and search tags work for them.   I guess the best thing I can say is if you’re determined and willing to put the time in, as well as quality, then you should be good to go especially since you plan on having other products."
Etsy,3c8fww,PandaSlanda,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"I sell beeswax candles on Etsy. I opened my shop last August, after spending a couple of months ""perfecting"" my craft. I liked to make candles as a child and decided to get back into it as an adult.   My shop has been open for almost a year, and it's been a fun learning process. I would say I'm just now starting to make back the money I put into my shop (materials I needed to make the candles, ""marketing"" supplies, etc.). For a while I was just making back what I had already spent. Now I seem to be pulling in a bit of extra spending money for myself. I'm a teacher, so it's fun to have something to do during the summer. I found that the holiday season was busiest for me. You won't be rolling in cash, but if you put in the time and effort you will start to have some extra ""fun"" money.   I also started doing live markets/craft shows during the holiday season. LOTS of people were interested and bought candles at these events! Good luck with whatever you decide to do!"
Etsy,3c8fww,teacher_lady,3,Mon Jul 6 04:22:36 2015 UTC,"I started my woodworking shop in January and have had a similar experience. It took a few months of feeling like I was putting lots of money into it and not getting much return as I built up some inventory. However, in the last few months, I have been making the same amount of money as I do teaching. In my state, teachers aren't getting raises, so this was an enjoyable way to get one! Even though I am ""working"" a lot in my free time, it is so fun! I'm looking forward to the holidays!"
Etsy,3c8fww,Hubert546,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:29:31 2015 UTC,"Things you need to consider because this will be big, is how you're going to ship them. Will you need to buy little boxes for the candle to go in a big shipping box? Will you buy bubble wrap sleeves for them instead of a little box? Will you buy shipping boxes or use USPS? Candles in glass containers are heavy and expensive to ship. Will the overall candle price still be reasonable?   Even with my glass marble magnets how to ship them became a much more complicated process than just making, photographing and listing them. Unfortunately, I didn't research the shipping part enough and really had to scramble in the beginning to safely ship my glass marble magnets so they wouldn't stick to the Post office machinery, get there in one piece and still be cost effective for both me and the buyer.  Good luck!"
Etsy,3c8fww,sirius_moonlight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:22:14 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of candle stores on Etsy. To come out on top, you need to use great tags (SEO) and make yourself stand out among the crowd with a unique feature for your store.   A good idea would be for you to go ahead and do any local events you can. Local events help boost your store and spread to other people, potentially starting a long chain of people suggesting your shop. Local events are also good for selling, of course. Renaissance Faires are probably one of the best events you can sell at."
Etsy,3c8fww,iTrollYhu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"There are lots of candle listings on etsy, so I'm sure there are people buying them. If you search for candles in the handmade section you'll get more than 170,000 results. The only way to find out how well you'll do, is if you try."
Etsy,3c8fww,trailscrafts,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'd also want to expand to more items that may not be in the same category as candles, like art, jewelry, or something like that. Do you think this might be a made idea?"
Etsy,3c8fww,trailscrafts,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:44:17 2015 UTC,"There are lots of items in each of those categories, and there lots of shops that do well.  I have found that depending on how much time you put into your shop greatly effects the success level. Why not try listing a few from different categories and see what does the best for you? I have items in my shop from different categories. Some sellers prefer to have separate shops for different type of items, but I prefer to have everything in one, since it's easier for me to keep track of."
Etsy,3c8aox,PoisonIvee,7,Sun Jul 5 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"Okay I just woke up so take with a tiny pinch of salt but how to buy is confusing, and your pictures are too.  Instead of one listing with 40 variants break that up, make it 40 listings! It'll be cleaner and easier for people to understand. Then you can have 5 pictures of the one design t your pictures will be way more attractive.  These are pretty, take advantage of that!"

Etsy,3c8aox,littletinypiranha,2,Sun Jul 5 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that having multiple listings would make it easier for people to understand. The more listings you have, the easier it will be to be found.  When shipping, if you are worried about bending, I would consider something more protective than a standard envelope. Usually though, whenever I have received a greeting card in the mail, it arrives fine in a standard envelope.   I haven't had many tough customers on etsy. Most buyers have been great. I can't think of anything in particular that someone would take advantage of you with. If you spend a lot of time worrying about what may happen, you'll just drive yourself crazy.  If you are shipping in something other than a standard envelope your shipping prices seem good.  My only other suggestion would be, to write your policies page."
Etsy,3c8aox,Christypaints,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, I'll be making the changes to the categories soon. Never even heard of the policies page, so I'll be looking into changing that too!"
Etsy,3c8aox,5bi5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"The way variations are set up you have to select one option from EACH category (if you try buying the item yourself you'll notice that you get stuck until you pick one from each). I also agree that having 95 options to be way too much. Not saying you should split them all up into 95 separate listings when you're just starting but definitely try to break them down or group similar themed ones together. I would recommend no more than 6 variations per listing.   You should also take note that sometimes TOO many options will end up being a bad things. Customers will become overwhelmed by all the options, have a difficult time deciding, and not end up buying anything. You should really pick a few of your favorite ones to feature first and maybe add more as time goes on.   I would recommend shipping the card sandwiched between some stiffer material. However, if I remember correctly, if the item is completely rigid it may be considered a parcel so you should clear that up and choose your protective material accordingly.   Shipping looks fine.   Also, do you take your own photos? You should mention it if you do and if you don't you should make sure you have permission from the original photographer to use the photos."
Etsy,3c8aox,tom8o,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:47:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, consensus is too many options! Very good to know. Yes I do take my own photos an I thought since I put my title as ""Owner, Photographer"" it would be obvious but maybe I could mention that too!"
Etsy,3c77oz,wjs018,4,Sun Jul 5 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend that you use all five images allowed to show scale and detail.   I agree with trailscrafts that the magnets are copyright infringement, at the very least you can not call them by their trademarked names.   I would consider shipping outside the US, USPS makes it pretty easy and taking more options of payment than Etsy checkout (a lot of people like to use Paypal)."
Etsy,3c77oz,pigandpeacock,2,Sun Jul 5 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"Having more pictures of the knitted items would be a great addition. I think your prices are fair.   Your post mentions that you are aware that you shouldn't have a brand name in your shop name, but you have items in your shop that are infringing on some else's copyright. Have you tried creating your own characters?"

Etsy,3c77oz,funchy,0,Sun Jul 5 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"Your shop looks good!   Do think about shipping outside of the US. If people want it, theyll pay shipping for it. And with the calculated shipping, you only need the weight and package dimensions, something you can easily get from a trip to the post office. I can say for myself that 60% of my sales come from overseas.   Also, think about opening a PayPal! Some people can only pay through there, and that could be a couple of extra sales.   I looked at your policies, and while I don't personally agree with the ""no returns""  policy, having a good reason why would be good. Like, you can't accept them of they're worn, or used, or whatever. People like the security that they can return something, but it doesn't mean hat they will.   You do have pokemon stuff, so be prepared for other Etsians to ream you. While I personally don't mind (hell, I sell Umbreon and other pokemon tails on occasion), others will. Some might just leave a kind warning, others will be real salty about it. Because of what you make, a good mix of fandom and your own personal stuff might work well. Try making animals. bitches love animals! Use small amounts of pokemon stuff to draw in people, and encourage them to buy your original stuff. (I'm pretty sensitive on this sort of thing xD)   That's all I've got xD"

Etsy,3c535a,kaitlynx6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:56:11 2015 UTC,"I have sent messages to the respective people and never received any responses either way. (Since all of the other things are super well-known, I'm guessing said people get a ton more messages on a daily basis than Peter David does.) However, since countless other Etsy sellers are also able to sell items related to these properties without issue, my understanding is that it is safe; in cases where the owners of the IPs were to request that Etsy sellers take down related items, I would oblige. I also fully acknowledge that my items are fan art, and I do not present them as licensed merchandise."
Etsy,3c535a,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:43:25 2015 UTC,"It's not ""safe"", it's still ripping off other people's IP. If they decide to they can file with Etsy to have your items taken down. If you make profit off of it, they can decide they want payment for profiting off of their IP in addition to you no longer being able to make those items any longer.  Just because someone else is breaking the rules and getting away with it doesn't mean that it's okay to also do so. Just because you haven't been caught and told to stop it yet also doesn't mean it's okay."
Etsy,3c5usz,motorpsykal,4,Sun Jul 5 02:45:10 2015 UTC,"The quality of your items looks to be very solid. The first thing I would recommend would be better photos of your items. Try to highlight the best features of each piece, and don't let your photo background be a distraction from your items. Since your listings seem to be mostly wallets, I know that as a buyer I would be reluctant to purchase without knowing what the inside looked like (how many pockets, how they're arranged, etc.) That may be something you should consider in regards to adding a few extra photos for each listing.   Good luck, and I hope your sales pick up!  Edit: Apologies! Just noticed that your listings do contain multiple photos, so disregard that particular piece of advice."
Etsy,3c5usz,dearwilde,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:16:18 2015 UTC,Thank you. I need to upgrade my photos for sure. I'm thinking about making a simple lightbox setup i saw the other day.

Etsy,3c5usz,pigandpeacock,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"I would be sure to use all five photos, to show scale and detail, and I would also reshoot them with cleaner/simpler backgrounds.   I noticed the description was very short. Think like a buyer when you are writing your descriptions...what are the dimensions, what kind of leather is this made from, about how many cards will it hold.  I also saw that shipping takes 1-2 weeks, are these handmade to order? If so, I would say that too. If they are not I would think about tightening up your shipping window to 1 week max. And your policies section is empty, having set policies instills a certain level of comfort with buyers to purchase.  Your about section is empty, this would be a great place that you could showcase how you make your wallets. The craftsmanship on them is really nice and you should show that off!  Good luck to you!"

Etsy,3c4dms,novapine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Pricing is actually one reason why I started on Etsy. I used to sell my handmade items on eBay, but I would constantly get people arguing with me about prices and begging for discounts. I haven't had that issue on Etsy yet, and granted, I haven't been on Etsy long yet, but I'm hoping people there are more understanding of the fact that handmade items aren't free."
Etsy,3c4dms,PinballWizard77,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:14:26 2015 UTC,When I'm pricing things in my store I always make it a dollar or two more than I think it's worth. :)
Etsy,3c2vbp,BrokeAssBuilder,12,Sat Jul 4 06:19:36 2015 UTC,"I say, fine! We'll make our own cool fictional universes with blackjack and hookers!   I'm all for sharing, and the free distribution of fanwork (I've made and distributed my share of non-monetized music fanvids and fanfiction over the years), but once you start charging money for your fanwork you're in ethically shady territory. If I made Doctor Who coloring pages and people bought them, they'd be buying them because they like Doctor Who, rather than because they like me. I'd be making money off someone else's hard work without their consent and without giving them a share of the earnings. That's not right.   That said, the ethics of this are a gradient from ""blatant rip off"" to ""respectful nod"" to ""vague reference."" It might be worth looking into the specifics of copyright law as it relates to parody and what exactly counts as parody. Parody and satire are protected from infringement claims.  I bet there are other exceptions too.  Since Etsy is US based, I'm pretty sure US law is what matters here, no matter where a seller is personally located."
Etsy,3c2vbp,candyhippie,9,Sat Jul 4 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"A big problem I've seen, especially in discussions on here, is people feeling like they deserve to make things...like they love Dr. Who so much that they know what products need to have dr who on them best, so if there isn't a licensed Dr. Who elbow length knit gloves already then the BBC just is too stupid to know their market and they will make it because people want it. It drives me bonkers."

Etsy,3c2vbp,sirius_moonlight,9,Sun Jul 5 16:07:33 2015 UTC,Here is one of my favorite Etsy forum discussions on that subject. https://www.etsy.com/teams/7722/discussions/discuss/15084283/page/41  I like it because no one hears about what happens since the stores are closed and I'm sure people don't want to make another account (if they even can) to tell their story. This one talks about a neighbor who got notice from Disney and may be taken to court.   Copyright infringement can be much more than losing the listings and the shops. Companies have tons of money if they chose to make an example out of someone.  (I think my link is the one imachocolatewaffle is referencing.)
Etsy,3c2vbp,pigandpeacock,3,Sat Jul 4 10:11:32 2015 UTC,"So not worth it. Disney taking her computer, printer and tools? Nope, def not worth a couple extra bucks."
Etsy,3c2vbp,courtneyj,8,Sun Jul 5 16:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. Every sold Pusheen item on Etsy was technically taking money away from Claire Belton, and I gladly will support an artist in any attempts to fully own their ideas and designs."
Etsy,3c2vbp,Ariadne89,6,Sat Jul 4 18:43:34 2015 UTC,"I noticed something kind of similar to this as a buyer just recently. A while back I had favourited a bunch of listings for these amazing looking coffee tables. The seller was based in British Columbia (I'm Canadian myself.. so like to buy from Canadian sellers when possible) and the whole shop was tables that were like this rustic looking wood with a beautiful blue/green glass inlay in the middle that would look like a river or lake running down the middle of the coffee table. They were gorgeous and around $1500 and I was actually thinking of getting one when we move into our new place. I didn't really know much about the style of table, I just though it looked amazing.  Anyways, yesterday I went to look for the tables and they were completely gone.. I know 100% I had favourited a bunch of them and they just weren't anywhere in my favourites. I don't know if the shop was closed or the listings were deactivated or what, but they were just gone. I tried searching and I couldn't find the shop or anyone selling ""river tables"" at all. Curious as to why I couldn't find them, I googled around a bit and realized there is a famous furniture designer/maker who is the originator of these ""river tables"": Greg Klassen. Now at the time I favourited the (much cheaper) tables on etsy, I had no idea they were a copy of someone else's designs, but I can say they looked virtually identical to the tables I discovered on Greg Klassen's website. So I'm assuming that seller was banned from selling those types of tables due to basically stealing the design from someone else? That's the only reason I can imagine all the tables on etsy under ""river tables"" disappeared, to the point that searching doesn't bring up a single one."
Etsy,3c2vbp,candyhippie,4,Sat Jul 4 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"That's strange and tricky. I don't think you can copyright an idea or a style. I wonder what happened? Maybe Etsy dropped the hammer too hard on this one? Or maybe Klassen sent a letter to someone, Etsy or the seller? Or maybe the seller was impersonating Klassen?   It really sucks that the shop was disappeared without explanation. I'd love it if Etsy made it possible to replace a closed shop's frontpage with an explanation for at least a year. A note from the ex-seller, or if Etsy closed it, a sort of eviction notice stating which violations caused the closure."
Etsy,3c2vbp,courtneyj,3,Sat Jul 4 16:26:12 2015 UTC,He could have also had patents over the process or design that he could have enforced against sellers.
Etsy,3c2vbp,Ariadne89,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean technically I have no idea what happened, I may be making assumptions. Possibly the shop went away on its own for some reason. But I do know that when you searched ""river table"" on etsy there used to be a bunch of tables with the raw style wood and the blue/green glass that all looked like very close imitations of the Klassen tables, and now when you search river tables they're all gone."

Etsy,3c2vbp,sableine,2,Sat Jul 4 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"I mean if you want to get into it, Disney steals a lot of ideas and plotlines from folklore stories. That doesn't mean you can't make your own characters inspired by the original story of Peter Pan, but you certainly can't run around with the actual artwork or quotes from the movie. If I wanted to put ""Snow queen"" tags on my Frozen inspired things I'd be fine, but not if I listed them as ""Frozen"" instead."
Etsy,3c2vbp,imachocolatewaffle,0,Sun Jul 5 06:06:18 2015 UTC,"They dont ""steal"" anything.

Etsy,3c2vbp,mypomonkey,6,Sat Jul 4 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"I really like that etsy is starting to crack down on copyright infringement. Etsy was meant to be a place for creators to create new products. It was meant to be a creative outlet for artists to make their original art. At some point the original art got drowned out by commercialized replicas and cheap knock offs. I hope that etsy ""gets back to its roots"" in a sense for original ideas and artwork to become the norm again."
Etsy,3c2vbp,hedera3,5,Sun Jul 5 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"A couple of years ago, my son had a minecraft party and I created all the items for it since there was nothing on the market yet. http://coolprogeny.com/2013/09/have-a-blast-minecraft-birthday-party/  At that point I already had an Etsy shop selling calendars and calling cards. I had enough people asking me for the products so I put them up on my site. I had both printed items and digital files. Things were selling fairly well. After a couple of months I received an infringement notice on the invite only. I assumed it was for the use of the characters. I couldn't get a straight answer from Etsy (they simply pull the item(s) that are flagged from outside companies and can't tell you anything about the others. And Mojang wouldn't contact me back. I didn't want to risk further issues so I just didn't relist that item. Fast forward several months later and randomly another item was pulled. But only the digital and not the printed. A couple of weeks later, pretty much all the Minecraft items were pulled. Only one remained and is still active to this day: https://www.etsy.com/listing/161124834/sale-minecraft-party-decor-tnt-wraps?ref=shop_home_feat_2  I was never able to figure out the rhyme or reason. My items were pulled, but other's shops' were not. And I have not been contacted by Mojang.   During the whole process, I was more concerned with keeping my shop open because I had been growing my calendar business for a few years at that point. And Etsy warns you that too many infringements and they shut you down."

I did notice that Mojang went through and purged quite a few Minecraft items, though they've crept back up again."

Maybe to encourage people to hold on to the card, it could be a little piece of art, or some sort of coupon code if that's relevant? I'm not very familiar with Kickstarter but I agree that most people will definitely forget all about that come January so something to encourage them to keep the card may be helpful."
Etsy,3c398m,phoebeandjuniper,2,Sat Jul 4 17:28:24 2015 UTC,Ohh that's a good idea. Maybe if it's not too expensive you can make it into a small fridge magnet. I would be a lot less likely to throw out a fridge magnet because it'd feel so wasteful to me.
Etsy,3c398m,littletinypiranha,2,Sat Jul 4 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"You can include whatever you like in the package, but like /u/sirius_moonlight says, that's not going to be engaging enough to get people to check a separate website 6 months from now where all you're really doing is asking for more of their money.  You need to be building the network and followers instead so that when the kickstarter launched they will be engaged and already following closely. So, include cards and incentives that will keep them connected to you so you can introduce the kickstarter in January that way. Coupons, a flyer that says if you like our page you'll be entered for a giveaway, an ask to post their item on instagram with a specific hashtag, etc."

Etsy,3c16t4,throwawayaccount1414,3,Fri Jul 3 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"Besides improving your SEO, there isn't a way to change what shows up in Etsy search. If that item remains at the top of the search it's because people click on it often. Perhaps add links in that listing to other similar items, or to shop sections with different jewelry boxes to maximize on the exposure and lead to more sales. Try to identify what is working with that listing so you can apply it to others as well, but be careful about changing too much on the listing itself. I swapped out photos for a listing that was ranking well in searches and it did something to the algorithm and took weeks to get back on the first page."

Etsy,3c16t4,phoebeandjuniper,2,Fri Jul 3 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"It's not based on how many views you have, it's how often people click or interact with your listing from that search. It's the same as most search engines, if someone searches ""jewelry box"" and clicks on you, it tells the search engine that your item must be relevant for that search. If they favorite it or order that item, it has even more weight for that search. Views only affect search results on Etsy when they come from that search - overall views from outside traffic have no impact (as far as I'm aware.)"
Etsy,3c16t4,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.

Etsy,3bzc9e,marctz,2,Fri Jul 3 11:03:41 2015 UTC,"Heya,  I run CtrlAltGeek over on Etsy. I sell prints too, and I've only been going since Feb, so take my advice with a pinch of salt.  I just took a quick look at your shop. You've got most of it covered. The mock-framed pics are nice, although you might wanna include a non framed pic, so people can see exactly what they're getting. The tags seem okay, and you're using them all.  Just keep producing your work, keep pushing yourself to do more stuff. If you can handle criticism okay, I'd recommend chucking a design to somewhere like /r/typography for your text based stuff. Also, if you haven't already, join /r/graphic_design, it's not a place for critiques, but you'll learn a ton.  Oh, and I think you're missing a market, by only selling A4 prints. If you're designing the prints yourself, you might as well let them download them at A3 or even A2.  Checking back to your store. The Wounded Deer piece is pretty delicious. I reckon if you sorted the centering on 'Highest', turned it to a black background and gave a bit of space at the bottom so it wasn't cut right off... then had that available at A3 for that price to digi download. Would be sweet.  Sorry, didn't mean to ramble into critique. Just got back from the pub. Anyway, anythin else I can help with, just ask. Oh yeh, one more thing, favourite other shops, and favourite other pieces that you actually do like. This has made a noticable change in viewings for me, and I feel like I'm doing my bit for other artists out there too."
Etsy,3bzc9e,mewk69,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:54:21 2015 UTC,Thank you sir. I really appreciate that. I will make those changes and see what comes out. Its always good to have real critique from another designer.  Thanks again for taking the time. It means a lot.

Etsy,3c0gyc,iTrollYhu,5,Fri Jul 3 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"you cant remove them to my knowledge, despite the unfair nature of it. BUT you can make a response giving other potential customers the big picture. this might help. Otherwise the only other way is to reach out to them and make it clear that this is a very damaging review to your Etsy store and relying on them to change it."
Etsy,3c0gyc,mrgrandgrind,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:56:00 2015 UTC,I'll hold off on the reply for a bit just to make sure that even putting a reply could mess up any kind of removal. I've already been kinda putting together a reply I could say for my other buyers.  I can't see them removing it. Especially since they went ahead to leave that review after getting the money back and having the 2 cases/disputes closed afterwards.
Etsy,3c0gyc,hedera3,5,Fri Jul 3 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't contact her asking her to change it as was suggested.  In my experience mentoring others that situation doesn't ever turn out well.  Make sure you keep your response neutral and professional.    I contacted the customer after purchase and advised her of the time frame required for her order.  To be fair to all my customers, orders are processed in the order received.  While every effort is made ship orders in a timely manner, high order volume and the time required for these pieces means there will be a wait.  It is unfortunate that the customer did not allow for this, however her money was promptly and fully refunded."
Etsy,3c0gyc,hedera3,2,Fri Jul 3 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that reply guide there. I'm going to add a few things in about the actual time period and what the item was, even though people can see it anyway."

Etsy,3c0gyc,hedera3,3,Fri Jul 3 19:12:33 2015 UTC,"Just be careful when responding to reviews that you don't criticize the buyer directly and explain the situation as professionally as possible. The response you left made me cringe a little. I totally understand getting frustrated with them but some people just can't be satisfied and you move on. It's fine to take as long as you need to fill orders as long as those time frames are clearly posted for buyers. Do you have the processing time posted anywhere on your site? Even after adding an item to my cart I still couldn't find it. I'm 100% fine waiting for an item as long as I know how long I'm going to be waiting, but I'd be disappointed if it was that long and I was unaware of it before paying.   In the end though, I agree - if she got her money back then in my opinion the transaction no longer exists and she shouldn't have been allowed to leave a review. I've had that happen to me too and it's so frustrating."
Etsy,3c0gyc,hedera3,2,Fri Jul 3 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do to avoid situations like this is to put processing times on your order.  Then the buyer can't leave a review until 2 business days after the scheduled ship date.  She wouldn't have been able to file a dispute on Etsy, she would have been directed to message you.  She would only have been able to file a dispute on PayPal.  Then you could have refunded, cancelled, and not had to worry about a bad review.  I know this doesn't help you now, but hopefully it will help you in future.  Bad feedback over issues like this - that can be solved with the buyer actually reading before purchasing, sucks big time.  *Edited to add - I wouldn't worry too much about her bad review.  There are two glowing reviews for the same item directly underneath hers. She sounds disgruntled - which she most certainly is - but it wouldn't deter me from buying."
Etsy,3c0gyc,bigblued,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks. I was really thinking about going ahead to do that now. Should I just throw in a general time period? I'm thinking maybe a month and a half? Some of these orders get pretty big and I think it's probably better to put in the maximum amount of time.   Can people leave a review if the thing has shipped but there's still __ amount of time left for processing? I've still only had 20 reviews out of 40 people, so I'd like to keep getting a good flow of reviews."

I've noticed that I get a lot of traffic from the search ""planner accessories"" specifically, so try including that tag in all of your listings. Other than that, I would just try to be specific with your tags, such as ""bow planner clip"" or ""tulle bow clip"" etc.  Other than that, I would just suggest tiny changes, like including the size of the clips in your listings, and adding a bit more detail.

Etsy,3bxvpz,CarolinaKudzu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:50:11 2015 UTC,Oh no of course. I mean strictly just putting a card in with physical orders- not including it with anything online in my first shop or digital pattern orders.
Etsy,3bxvpz,Christypaints,2,Fri Jul 3 01:52:49 2015 UTC,I would definitely put something in the packages for orders. Maybe even a little blurb sent out with the receipt email?

Etsy,3bvybd,BeckerHollow,3,Thu Jul 2 20:40:56 2015 UTC,Mostly vintage and antique typewriters that I refurbish and return to working condition.
Etsy,3bvybd,mojoman913,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:24:55 2015 UTC,Interesting! What a cool category too!
Etsy,3bvybd,phoebeandjuniper,3,Thu Jul 2 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, the more products you have the better the views (to an extent.) 100 items has commonly been said to be a ""magic number"" not based on any actual algorithm but as number people shoot for quite often. It's an odds game - if you have more hooks in the water, you increase your chances of getting a bite. I have some listings that I don't love and would remove, but leave them because people often find my shop through those listings and then go on to purchase or browse other items.  Just make sure to have sections for people to look through easily and that you treat each listing with the same importance (good photos and descriptions,etc.) There are some shops with thousands of items and that can be pretty daunting to search through!"
Etsy,3bvybd,aycockdesigns,2,Thu Jul 2 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I just deactivated a few of my very old designs, just because I feel like they are dated, but maybe I should reactivate them!   My goal was 100 for a while, but I think a new goal should be 1,000!"

Etsy,3bvypx,Megzyz,2,Thu Jul 2 16:27:29 2015 UTC,Go to your listings manager.   On the sidebar you'll see what's called 'sections'. Manage sections. This is where you create and can organize how they appear on your shop.  From the listings manager you can also start putting your items in certain sections. One item can't be in different sections.

Sales were back up to par in a few days' time to a week.  But I closed for an entire month this year and the next month it was a long fight back and I made 1K less than usual.

Etsy,3bsdzl,CarolinaKudzu,3,Thu Jul 2 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"6 weeks is a long time without activity, the sooner you can start adding items the better. I think it take 2-4 weeks to recover."

Start adding synonyms and other popular words for plushies like ""stuffed animal"", ""plushie"", ""soft toy"", etc. I would browse around competitive popular shops and see what they use as tags to get a good idea.  Your ""all sales are final"" policy is probably also scaring off potential buyers. You should consider accepting returns. And it's probably also not enforceable if the buyer receives something that they feel is not described properly. Paypal and Etsy will refund it if they have a good case."

Etsy,3bt4b1,PaintballKitty,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:04:46 2015 UTC,Just changed all of the preview pictures. I've considered adding a watermark but I don't know of an easy way to add a watermark to my 32 pictures
Etsy,3bt4b1,sneaky_dragon,2,Wed Jul 1 23:12:16 2015 UTC,I'm sure there are bulk watermarking apps. I personally wrote my own Python script to do it.
Etsy,3bt4b1,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"From the comment above I assume you used to have a photo of the print on some surface. Did you remove that photo because, of the listings I looked at, you only have one picture. As a customer I would want to see a photo of what the final print would look like. You should have those type of ""sample"" pictures in the additional slots."
Etsy,3bt4b1,briekachu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:35:37 2015 UTC,I have the sample pictures in only a handful of listings.
Etsy,3bt4b1,phoebeandjuniper,5,Thu Jul 2 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"I would ignore the listings unless it had actual mock ups for the front preview image. In my mind, as a buyer, that's a big difference between something professional and something amateurly thrown on Etsy with little care. I wouldn't click to see it as a secondary picture unless I was incredibly blown away by the image.   I like your ""Building Under the Stars"" photo. The contrast between the orange and the dark is pretty. But I put it in a mock frame and I like the way it looks even more. clicky  Oh, and as for the watermark - I'm assuming you have Photoshop? You can make an action that adds your watermark to the photo, and then make that action part of a script (which is nice because you can also have it autosave your photos after adding the watermark). That's what I do with my product photography. Hope that helps!"
Etsy,3bt4b1,briekachu,3,Thu Jul 2 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with this. I love seeing prints and photos shown in context, whether framed or hung on a wall. It makes a big difference to buyers and helps them picture the item in their home. Plus, art and photography are tricky to sell and helping people conceptualize that it's a physical object they are purchasing is super helpful."

Wouldn't doubt that they're automated bots. It's real easy to trick ETSY though.  EDIT: I also doubt they have a team to deal w/ this. Maybe just a reverse image search of some products, if that. I recall finding a few shops within the span of 30minutes all w/ products from ali. Amazon currently has this going on through FBA and hopefully it doesn't happen w/ their handmade shops section. Curious to what barriers they put in place. They should really require a timelapse video of a product being created in order to be qualified as ""handmade"". Simply showing fabrics, wood, or other components of a shop, can easily be faked to make it seem like you're actually a creator of shit."
Etsy,3br4s1,PawedUp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:06:27 2015 UTC,Wasn't able to find a replica supplier/reseller for them.  Any proof? Their website was registered in 2009 and it seems they're brazillian.  https://instagram.com/shofarkids/ is their insta. They seem very involved w/ their products and community.  I seriously doubt they're a reseller.  It's not nice to throw shops out there as a reseller/ETC without a little bit of info to substantiate the claim. They seem to have an honest business. Please provide info if you have any.

Etsy,3bsl1u,hebejebez,16,Wed Jul 1 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Almost every single item in your store is infringing on copyright. My suggestion to you is to make your own original designs that do not piggyback off of games, movies or famous people."

These are the shops and items you are competing with and it's an incredibly saturated market.   You want to know why you don't get more than 100 views a day? It's because anyone searching for ""pokemon prints"" will need to wade through over 54 pages of listings, and by the time they get to yours, they will have already found something they like. I'm not saying that whatever they found is better than yours, it was just easier to find, and that's what it comes down to.   Piggybacking on popular culture like games, movies or famous people is incredibly easy, which is why a lot of people do it. You don't have to create your own brand, your own catchphrases, your own characters or images. That's the hard part. I'm not trying to undermine your work, because from the prints you've created, you're obviously talented. If you were serious about selling your designs as an artist and wanted to be successful doing it, you would be making your own original designs and trying to get those to catch on. After all, that's what all those big companies did in the first place."
Etsy,3bsl1u,imachocolatewaffle,-5,Wed Jul 1 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Quick preface that I have a -300% desire to argue the merits of fan-work and umbrella IP  It would seem to me that building an original brand would inherit the same keyword saturation but from a different angle. Users would have to seek out my specific name/brand or search for the actual content to which I'm illustrating in order to find me. This seems akin to users searching for their favorite pop-culture item and landing on my fan-work prints.   For instance, I don't think it's much easier for a hand-made jewelry shop to crash into the mystical search algorithms of Etsy and capitalize on ""jewelry"", ""hand-made"", etc., without first building the popularity of the shop -- exactly what I'm trying to do with my prints.   So for that, I'm not sure the views are being limited by the content of the work in all cases, especially considering we've moved to the front, second and third pages on a lot of the keywords for our work. But, that's really what I was originally asking for, since our views have plateaued in a manner that would seem indicative of Etsy tweaking the mechanistic knobs behind the scenes. Either from a lack of uploading new products or (hopefully not) a lack of interest. I'm inclined to to believe the former considering the sales have been steady, though admittedly low, while the views have stagnated.   Thanks for your take."
Etsy,3bsl1u,mojoman913,14,Wed Jul 1 22:15:41 2015 UTC,If you want any real chance at a successful shop/business you need to start designing your own work. Your shop will eventually get taken down.
Etsy,3bsl1u,funchy,2,Wed Jul 1 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"I think you should look at the liability issues associated with potentially infringing work before you put any more effort into selling or marketing. The chances that your store could get shut down are significant, even if the chances that you might get sued are low. But, if you do get sued, unless you have formed a corporation, LLC, or other liability shielding business structure, you'd be personally liable for any damages, and those can be significant. Statutory damages for copyright infringement can be ridiculously high, with damages of not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per infringed item, though I'm not exactly sure about that range.  On the plus side, it looks like you have some non-infringing designs that have brought some interest and sales. I think focusing on those items and removing the potential problem items would be the safest bet for you."

Etsy,3boq8l,mmm_ice_cream,3,Wed Jul 1 13:18:35 2015 UTC,I think those two are similar enough to put in one. Multiple shops is more directed to those who maybe both... kitting and handmade/hand-painted clocks. They would be better suited in two shops.

It's rather straightforward.  https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3207  Buyers are subject to customs taxes and other importation fees, but that's not your responsibility. A customs form is for the officials to see what you're mailing without needing to open up your package."
Etsy,3bpr9n,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:39:51 2015 UTC,"I shipped internationally to Canada using Etsy and it was pretty painless, although ridiculously expensive.  Buyer didn't seem to mind though, they are used to paying more for everything in the land of VAT. Etsy fills out the custom form for you, and it gets printed right on the label.  Definitely recommend packing a little extra snug knowing it will be traveling farther though, my first shipment broke."
Etsy,3bpr9n,jbishpotter,3,Wed Jul 1 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at helping you out here.  International shipping is a completely different animal than domestic shipping. Individual countries have made all sorts of laws regulating what can come in or go out of their countries. They also get into trade wars with other countries and ban certain imports or tax them heavily. Because of this, in almost every country, every good coming into the country is scrutinized. It doesn't matter if it is a small plaque or a luxury car. Everything goes through customs which is an inspection point to make sure nothing prohibited enters a country.  To streamline the process, the Post Offices of the various countries have standardized the paperwork needed with shipments. The paperwork has to be completed on every shipment moving between two countries. Again, it does not matter the size of the item or its value. Everything has to have the paperwork completed.  The primary information that is needed is the value of the item, what it is made of and what country it originated from. These items are used to determine how much tax to charge the recipient.   Also, customs gets especially interested in any agricultural products: plants, fruits, vegetables and in your case wood. This is because non-native species of plants and wildlife have a way of overtaking and demolishing local ecosystems. So many times, plants and items made from raw plant materials are completely prohibited. There are also international treaties prohibiting the trade of certain types of wood.  The paperwork you fill out helps the customs inspectors to decide whether the product you are shipping into the country is allowed. If it is, then that same paperwork helps customs determine how much in taxes and duties to charge the recipient.  Which gets to the telephone number. The customs office wants a telephone number so that they can contact the customer to collect the taxes and duties before releasing the item to the end consumer.  In Stamps.com, I have used my own telephone number to get around the phone number requirement. I have not had an issue yet and I ship internationally almost daily.  The re-sealable envelope is so the customs officers can access the paperwork easily without having to open the box to search for it.  I understand your frustration. I recommend learning what is needed on the forms so you don't have to spend a lot of time in the future trying to complete the paperwork.  Good luck."
Etsy,3bpr9n,my_favorite_name,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:13:24 2015 UTC,"If your items are under 4 pounds and you ship through the Etsy labels, it's pretty easy. The only extra step is filling in the little customs line where you put a brief description of the item, its weight, and quantity. If you ship the same thing most of the time you can even have this pre-filled.  Over 4 pounds becomes tricky because you have to ship priority and there's extra forms included, that then have to be put into one of those envelopes on the package. Otherwise it's just a label the same size as domestic and you stick it right on your product as normal."
Etsy,3bpr9n,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Etsy shipping is easy. beware there are problems with international, you can get badly burned if you don't weigh and check rates, I'm talking losing $10-15 on small items so be careful.

Etsy,3bo4ha,IrisJoris,2,Tue Jun 30 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"I think you might have to tag them with the exact tag. Or maybe it's a secret club! :P But really, that's a good question."

Etsy,3bm5jw,beatmakerpete,4,Tue Jun 30 09:47:25 2015 UTC,"I think your art is very nice, I like the simplistic style. That said, I don't think you should title and tag all of your listings the same way. I think that actually narrows your audience too much and as a customer I'm more likely to look at the titles/tags and think ""oh, for nurseries and children? but I'm not a young parent"". I think you should spread it out a bit, with the listings that are more ""child themed"", such as the custom names one, tagged in that regards and some of the other ones you can just title them as normal home deco. IMO I think you should set up your shop for a general audience and have a select few listings tailored more towards children/nurseries and not the other way around.   Also, I think it might be a good idea for you to also include smaller items at a lower pricepoint. Things like cards/postcards in singles or in a set would be cute and you could have them printed instead. (ETA: It'll also be flatter and lighter and thus easier/cheaper to ship internationally)  I think it's quite normal to not have a whole lot of shop views in the beginning. Do you advertise off of Etsy?"
Etsy,3bm5jw,littletinypiranha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:05:30 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thanks for your feedback - that's really useful indeed.   I have an instagram and pinterest and we heart it account - I also have listed on some local newspaper sites in my home country. But they are not driving traffic really.   I get your point about having it more general and then tailoring it to kids art. I'll also make a new section specifically for kids art, for those obvious items.   Do you think every title should be different? I might try that and see if any are viewed more than others, and try to spot trends.   Thanks again - really appreciate it!"
Etsy,3bm5jw,maria_ivanovna,5,Tue Jun 30 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"I also agree that you need some cheaper items in your store. I think your Moose will make great greeting cards, and/or prints. I think your illustrations are absolutely adorable.  Also try to use multiple words in your tags. Instead of ""canvas"" -- ""moose canvas"" ""moose decor"" ""animal nursery"" etc. I think tags like ""hand drawn"" won't get you found."
Etsy,3bm5jw,littletinypiranha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Perfect! thanks - I did wonder whether tags should be more than one word, or whether they were used together!   Thanks!"
Etsy,3bm5jw,locustandplum,2,Wed Jul 1 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"you don't have to title every one of them differently per se but if you can think of different titles I don't see the harm.   I don't know if this is true or not but I remember reading somewhere that with the new way the Etsy searches are formatted, you'll only have one item from your shop show in the search per page. Which is all the more reason to have different title/themes to target different audiences and potential search terms. BUT it's still good to at least keep some sort of unity between your listings.   I don't know how true this is for European sellers but I'll have to say that a very large chunk of potential customers will be from the USA so it's better for you to have options that you can ship relatively cheaply to the states as well. Think flat items like stickers, vinyl decor, postcards, etc.   I think your art is really cute and I hope you do well. :)  If you don't mind me giving some unsolicited suggestions you can also try doing different animals (in the same awesome theme) or different themes like wedding, graduation, birthdays."
Etsy,3bm5jw,rewdea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks - and unsolicited suggestions are really appreciated. And thanks for your feedback above.   I'd like to title the pieces at the beginning of each title, but I just read that the most important terms should be at the start. No one will probably search for the word ""Dopenhagen moose"", and I've just realised that, so I've put that to the end of the title.   A few people have mentioned postcards - are these really popular in USA? And how does one get these printed? I'm assuming there's a variety of companies in the states that does this - not so sure in Denmark - it's quite simple over here you see, which I'm sure you can see from their fashion sense and my art hahhahaha. But definitely good advice and I'll look into it!!!!   And theme's - yes, I thought of that indeed! I'm about to upload a hilariously cute moose without it's pants (trousers) - may get some laughs. If you have any more suggestions, fire them my way!!!   Thanks again!"
Etsy,3bm5jw,rewdea,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:29 2015 UTC,I love your shop!
Etsy,3bkqwl,sabineastroph,2,Tue Jun 30 00:49:18 2015 UTC,Don't be scared.  I have a very busy shop and quite often my international customers pay more for shipping than the item they ordered.
Etsy,3bkqwl,hedera3,2,Tue Jun 30 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Don't forget if you're sending internationally the buyer might have to pay customs/handling charges when it gets to their country. In the UK our customs charges for buying things from overseas are crazy high, so make sure you have in your policies that those costs aren't your problem if you haven't already."
Etsy,3bkqwl,SkadiofWinter,4,Tue Jun 30 07:56:13 2015 UTC,Etsy has reduced shipping over what the USPS charges online. If the item is worth it they'll pay the shipping. I have a few items that people over seas have paid $10 shipping on a $6 item.
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,2,Tue Jun 30 01:49:46 2015 UTC,can you explain the reduced shipping? o.o
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,-2,Tue Jun 30 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a lot, but it's nice.  For small items it's $2.04 fora  2oz package with free tracking. For the same through USPS it's around $6. You buy the shipping label through Etsy, print it, and mail it off!"
Etsy,3bkqwl,littletinypiranha,2,Tue Jun 30 02:46:57 2015 UTC,It's that much of a shipping discount? O_O  The discounts I get for CanadaPost labels (if any) are so minimal sigh.
Etsy,3bkqwl,unicrzy,4,Tue Jun 30 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"lol, no. For up to 3oz package, we pay $2.04 online and $2.54 if we go to the post to pay. To ship the same item internationally, it's $6.39 online and $7.10 in person."
Etsy,3bkqwl,littletinypiranha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, thanks. That sounds a lot more reasonable :P"
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,-3,Tue Jun 30 06:30:14 2015 UTC,That's w/o tracking to the post office if you don't want to wait in their lines to pay their $1 or what ever it is for tracking.
Etsy,3bkqwl,unicrzy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:24:30 2015 UTC,Still doesn't bring the package up to $6 honestly.
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,-2,Tue Jun 30 06:27:54 2015 UTC,Priority Mail 3-Day Price: $6.15 Online Price:$5.54  Lowest price for shipping a 2 oz rigid envelope with tracking online.
Etsy,3bkqwl,unicrzy,2,Tue Jun 30 06:36:11 2015 UTC,That is for priority mail. You can't compare First Class Mail rates with Priority rates.
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,-2,Tue Jun 30 06:46:44 2015 UTC,"I was comparing tracking options purchasable online. Since you can not buy tracking for first class, the only option is to compare it to priority.  It's my only option for my personal website unless I want to stand in the Post Office for 30+ minutes."
Etsy,3bkqwl,combustionbustion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"Not true. They added it to every single package now. The $2.54 rate above is correct. Though, my international is at cheapest $9.50 and that goes up depending the country."
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:57:06 2015 UTC,I stand corrected then. I haven't used it since the price increase.
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:01:40 2015 UTC,It's the tracking that USPS hits us so hard with. For them to add tracking they have to upgrade it to a parcel which goes to parcel rates. Etsy gets to keep it from being a parcel until 1pound.
Etsy,3bkqwl,combustionbustion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:03:54 2015 UTC,"See above, it's now added with no 'additional' .80 cent charge anymore. Though, it's definitely worked in somewhat with their new inflated rates."
Etsy,3bkqwl,comfy_socks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"USPS does not offer First Class Postage through their website. The reason it's so much more is because it's priority on USPS.com. $2.04 is the First Class Postage price for up to a 3 ounce package. The good thing about shipping through Etsy (or PayPal.com/shipnow) is your tracking number is included in the price, whereas in store at the post office, a tracking number is about $1 extra."
Etsy,3bkqwl,Orgran,-3,Tue Jun 30 06:13:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue there, is  you have to go to the post office to only pay the extra $1. Otherwise you have to pay out the arse online. How much is your time worth?"
Etsy,3bkqwl,hedera3,2,Tue Jun 30 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"My time is worth so much to me that I have a shipping client so I can pay for First Class in the comfort of my own studio.  You are losing money paying for Priority online.  Save yourself the money and pony up 15.99 a month for stamps.com  How much is your time worth?  USPS online postage is a pain in the arse.  Stamps.com, your orders are imported for you, 2 clicks and done."
Etsy,3bkqwl,comfy_socks,2,Tue Jun 30 20:13:06 2015 UTC,I ship from www.PayPal.com/shipnow and save time and money. Win win.
Etsy,3bkqwl,savannahrhayne,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"I've had international customers pay for Priority shipping at $25+ on a $8-$10 item. If someone wants what you've got, they'll pay what you ask. Although going through Etsy for labels definitely helps the cost."
Etsy,3bkqwl,mewk69,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:39:03 2015 UTC,"I sell prints that cost £11. Postage to the US is another £9. Yet the vast majority of my orders come from the States. I think most people look at an item and think 'am I willing to pay price + postage to own this?' I say charge your postage at actual cost price, you can't be fairer than that."
Etsy,3bkqwl,skunkhaus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:47:49 2015 UTC,"Here's a little context:  Amazon charges more in shipping than the items cost all the time.  Frequently I'll buy a used 8-track or something from the Goodwill in Ventura, and the item itself will cost 1.50 and shipping will be 2.95.  Or an ipod charging cable that costs 49 cents, with 3.99 shipping.  As a customer, 10 years ago this would have surprised me, but now I'm used to this sort of thing."
Etsy,3bkqwl,combustionbustion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:08:46 2015 UTC,I have plenty of affordable $4 earrings and my shipping is now $3.25 since the rates went up on the first. They sell constantly.   And I have tons of items that my $11-15 international shipping costs more than and they still sell all the time.
Etsy,3bkqwl,thedots,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"The items I ship overseas, which are usually no more than 2.5 ounces, will cost the buyer about $6.50 at the post office, and about $6.15 via etsy shipping.  Most of the items I sell are $9.00, and I'm not thrilled to charge the $6.00 shipping fee that I do, but I still get some sales from overseas.  Remember, there are people with money out there, for whom whatever shipping fee you charge , it won't be an issue."
Etsy,3bkqwl,courtneyj,0,Tue Jun 30 02:55:31 2015 UTC,In my experience buyers understand how much shipping costs so if you're not plopping it into an expensive flat rate box that it doesn't need many people will understand.

Etsy,3bkkf1,hawleywood,2,Tue Jun 30 02:29:48 2015 UTC,The best camera is always the one you have on you.
Etsy,3bkkf1,courtneyj,2,Wed Jul 1 03:44:11 2015 UTC,Agreed! :)
Etsy,3bkkf1,hawleywood,2,Wed Jul 1 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"I use a Fuji XE-1. Most useful thing I did was make a lightbox (loads of tutorials out there), and buy some decent daylight bulbs. Natural light is great if you can get it but it's not reliable. I don't want to have to sit around waiting for what might be days to see some direct sunlight, so daylight bulbs it is.  The more streamlined you can make your workflow, the better. Less time messing about with settings and taking photos means more time doing other useful stuff. I have a custom white balance setting which is perfect for my lights, and extension tubes for my lenses which mean I can get right up close (I make jewellery) so I don't have to crop later on. 95% of my photos are good to go right off the camera, after a quick resize so I'm not uploading 5MB jpegs to Etsy! I don't use RAW for product shots because in a controlled environment there's no need and it adds loads of time to post processing."
Etsy,3bkkf1,auntie-matter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"Canon 5d mkii,  use lots of natural light and use creative angles."
Etsy,3bkkf1,Musgojefe,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:28:56 2015 UTC,God damn.
Etsy,3bkkf1,DentistySch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:08 2015 UTC,"Any 8 megapixel or more camera will take decent photos. The thing you need for better photos is better light. Natural, indirect light is best. A soft box will kind of work."
Etsy,3bkkf1,jareths_tight_pants,3,Tue Jun 30 09:00:19 2015 UTC,Pixels don't equal quality. Quality of optics/sensor does.
Etsy,3bkkf1,IncrediblyEasy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:44:38 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness yes it does. A higher megapixel camera takes a more detailed photo at a larger size allowing for easier post processing and cropping. Shutter speed is important as well. But if you're choosing between a 2 megapixel camera and a 12 with the same shutter speed I'd go with the twelve. OP doesn't need a fancy $800 camera for item photos. The point of my post was to say that you can use a decent point and shoot or even a smartphone as long as you have good lighting.
Etsy,3bkkf1,jareths_tight_pants,2,Tue Jun 30 20:59:44 2015 UTC,"If the point was to have good lighting and shoot with whatever, then yes, light is generally the best way to take good pictures with even a potato.  Shutter speed is a thing you can control and I don't see why you point that out. Find the cheapest tripod to rest the camera on and you can shoot with whatever shutter speed you wish at low ISO.  I had to pick a used cheap camera a few years back exactly for taking Etsy photos. Pixels were towards the end of list of the reasons I picked it (6MP). Quality of photos mentioned in reviews was amongst the top reasons as well as it being a Canon compatible with CHDK for RAW capabilities and such. A sample picture for that matter."
Etsy,3bkkf1,IncrediblyEasy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:56:41 2015 UTC,Okay I have a Nikon with 16mpx I think and my photos are awful quality. I swear I got better with my old 12mpx.

I always include a handwritten note, a polishing cloth and a hand made gift envelope  and paint small watercolor flowers on it. Yes it's a pain but it really does work.

Etsy,3biur9,randomlygen,3,Mon Jun 29 21:34:03 2015 UTC,I believe the automated mail that goes out that ask for a review is triggered a few days after the item is due to be delivered. I'm not sure when that is exactly but my reviews tend to show up 4-5 days after the customers receive my item. I think there's also a button the customer can click when they view the order to leave a review. Check the etsy forums for details :-)

Or is the profit your salary?  What kind of business is it?  Is production easy or involved?  You can message me, I know somebody that may be interested depending on your answers.  Officially Etsy doesn't allow transfers of accounts so that would have to be on the down-low."
Etsy,3bk621,kindredmade,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:25:30 2015 UTC,The business profits are my salary. The 22% estimate is after cost of labor. I pay my employees about $14/hr.

Etsy,3bk621,sortika,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to what your shop is!   Etsy doesn't allow the sale/transfer of shops. Someone could buy out all of your inventory, but ""legally"" you can't just sell the whole operation. I'm not sure what the rules say about stepping down and letting another member of your shop take over."
Etsy,3bk621,sirius_moonlight,2,Tue Jun 30 12:20:39 2015 UTC,"Etsy TOS prevents the transfer of an Etsy account to another user, but there's nothing to prevent the sale of all assets (except the username/login) of an LLC to another person.  You'd probably have to transfer the assets to another, more permissive, ecommerce platform such as shopify, ebay, Big Commerce, Magento, something like that, so the brand equity that was created on Etsy would not be relevant to the terms of sale."
Etsy,3bk621,CarolinaKudzu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"You need to figure out whether your goodwill can include the account or not - until then, you likely won't have any serious buyers."

Someone on the forums tried to give it to a family member since she was ill unable to continue. Etsy said no. I would have thought that would have been more likely to get the ""OK"" than a basic selling of the business."
Etsy,3bigeu,theinvestingblog,3,Mon Jun 29 14:19:40 2015 UTC,"So here are my suggestions. Your tags look really good and descriptive, but in think your titles need to be filled out more. Etsy SEO uses both tags and titles for keywords.   The second paragraph about how its not generic to use fruit peels is strangely worded and comes off negatively. You might reword it, something like ""while its not common to use composted fruit rinds in soap,  its a great way to [reuse/recycle/reduce carbon footprint etc].   Is the background of your photos photoshopped in? Or the bottles of essential oils? Something about your pictures looks unnatural. I would photograph them on a white background - you can use a piece of poster board. The picture with the fruit and soap is a great idea, but could be executed better. I wouldn't include the picture of just the fruit without the soap. You might also consider doing a photo in a bathroom with the soap on a pretty dish.   I've never made soap, but $5 seems waaaaayyyyyy too cheap , especially if you're making your own compost, and since you're going to give 40% to charity.   You might consider talking about your soap making process on your about page.   Lastly, read up on Etsy's guidelines about making claims about health benefits. You probably need to redo your descriptions."
Etsy,3bigeu,cherryfristado,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:13:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  One of the first things I did was read both Etsy and FDA rules for making claims. However, I do not make any claims that my soap does all these things. I state the clinically proven results that the components in the soap do certain things for your skin, which is allowed.  I do agree that the pictures look a little unnatural, they were just shot in some odd light. I'll fix them this weekend, and that's a great idea to take a picture with it on a soap dish.  Regarding the price, I was checking that, and it seems that soap on Etsy sells for about $1-$1.5 per ounce, which is about what mine is selling at. Do you think I should raise the prices to $6 and $6.50, just because of the charity, or will that be considered too expensive?  Thanks again for the very descriptive feedback."
Etsy,3bigeu,Noctier,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"The second paragraph about how its not generic to use fruit peels is strangely worded and comes off negatively.    Or ""What makes our soaps unique is the use of composted fruit rinds, which are good for the environment and your skin"" - or something. I think it's better to avoid negatives entirely (e.g. 'not common'), but maybe that's just a personal preference.   I think the paragraphs about lavender oil and lemon oil could be made shorter, especially since you include links for people to follow if they want to read more."
Etsy,3bigeu,maria_ivanovna,5,Wed Jul 1 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"When I saw composted , I immediately had an image of a nasty compost bin in my head. I doubt that it's a good first impression of your brand."
Etsy,3bigeu,littletinypiranha,3,Mon Jun 29 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yah, I totally agree with you. When I first saw the title I thought that already composted fruit was being made into soap and the brownish colour of the soap in the photo didn't really help convince me otherwise.   Your tags look good to me so maybe someone else can provide more insight. How much marketing do you do off Etsy?"
Etsy,3bigeu,Noctier,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think your photos would benefit from making each product look a little more distinct. Right now, all the photos look almost identical, since you can't really make out what's on the bottles in the thumbnails. Instead of taking pictures of the soap with essential oils, maybe you could take pictures of it with actual lavender and lemon, to show the fragrance."
Etsy,3bg287,sabineastroph,32,Sun Jun 28 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I would just raise the prices and say nothing.  If someone questions you about the price increase, THEN you can mention something."
Etsy,3bg287,LittleBlueEyes,19,Sun Jun 28 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"You don't.  You raise the prices, and that's it.  You don't have to apologize or explain yourself in the listing.  You may see a slight lull, but if your shop was shared in ""just the right place"" it won't matter much at all.  If somebody asks you about the increase, tell them it was due to rising demand."
Etsy,3bg287,hedera3,10,Sun Jun 28 23:21:29 2015 UTC,"I think most sellers under value their work when they first start out. I would raise the prices if I were you, but I wouldn't explain anything unless asked. I have raised my prices several times over the years. If you aren't covering your time for labor, time for listing, processing and shipping orders, supplies and fees, then you should raise them accordingly."
Etsy,3bg287,trailscrafts,7,Sun Jun 28 22:51:57 2015 UTC,I agree with most of the comments here. Walmart doesn't send an email explaining why they raised the price on one of the items they sell. Ya know? I think you definitely should be charging more. You need to feel rewarded for the work you put in.
Etsy,3bg287,aycockdesigns,5,Sun Jun 28 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"I raised prices in January by about 15%. It seemed no one noticed, or at least no one asked or complained."
Etsy,3bg287,knittedsock,5,Mon Jun 29 07:00:35 2015 UTC,"I have talked to dozens of Etsy sellers at length about pricing, and literally not a one has ever said they regretted raising prices.  Just raise them to fair market value and make no apologies."
Etsy,3bg287,skunkhaus,3,Mon Jun 29 04:39:48 2015 UTC,Raise the price for new orders and anyone that ordered prior gets to pay the old price. You don't need to justify the price to anyone. If the price is right then they will buy. It isn't worth doing it if you can make a profit.
Etsy,3bg287,locustandplum,3,Sun Jun 28 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"No reason to explain yourself.  I think it's common knowledge that when there is a high demand for something, the price will increase.  Also, if you are spending a lot more time with sales of said items, you need to pay yourself for this ~ hence, a justifiable price increase."
Etsy,3bg287,thedots,2,Mon Jun 29 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"Honor any prices for commissions you've agreed to, but don't worry about raising  prices on open stock and future items. It takes a little while sometimes to find the best price point that you are comfortable with. If people question it, tell them how  many hours go into your pieces, and ask them how much they get paid per hour at their job."
Etsy,3bg287,RSinema,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:39:12 2015 UTC,"Raising your prices is a great idea, but it still sounds like you are guessing at what to charge. I'd suggest doing some research into pricing formulas and figure out exactly what you should be charging for your jars so that you aren't underselling yourself.  If the new price is a big jump and seems scary to you then slowly increase the price over time until you get it where you need it to be. You'll find that most people wont notice and those who do aren't going to say anything.   The one thing you can't do ask a customer for more money for something they have already ordered or commissioned. You must honour those agreements that were already made."

Etsy,3bfl59,trailscrafts,2,Sun Jun 28 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"I prefer to list my items in separate listings, even when they are similar. I find it easier to keep track of stock that way. I tried to set up a listing with variations once, but it would not let me set a quantity per variation, so I find it much easier to keep track up when they are separate."
Etsy,3bfl59,PawedUp,2,Mon Jun 29 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"If it's the same product then I would put it all in one listing.  I don't know what you mean when you say ""all different pieces of wood"", like reclaimed wood where all pieces have different age characteristics or do you mean different strains?  If you're altering the layout of the woods then that's more of a design/pattern change, which should be placed in it's own separate listing.  The reason you want to keep things in it's own listing is that it makes things much easier to keep track of. All your links go to 1 cutting block, rather than having shit scattered everyone on multiple listings. Multiple listings means more of your product(s) will show up in ETSY search though. So there are good and bad reasons.  You don't want to confuse people by adding too many options. You can have different styles on ""woods"" in the same listing, making sure to add pictures of the different variations w/ a watermark and dropdown box so that they can order the one they like.. Up to you really. I would opt for multiple listings if the variations are pretty different.  Most people that deal w/ reclaimed wood or a product that might vary from creation to creation, will add that disclaimer in their listing. Just to cover their ass a bit. You don't want someone to purchase something and think they've been deceived. Your shop can get shut down after all."

Etsy,3bctfg,skunkhaus,3,Sun Jun 28 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  - you mention the word effortless seven times and effortlessly another time. That's seven times too many.  - just because you can fit a website to the width of an iPhone doesn't mean you should.  Why force the user to scroll down forever?  No one will do this. Ever.  You lost me.  - I can barely figure out what you are selling or offering as a product. You need a one sentence plug that tells people what you do and let them sign up (check out paypal.com on mobile) - look at any other big player that takes mobile users seriously and see how they present a landing page for mobile OS's (mint.com, Etc.) - set one brand able domain name. You've got two which are singular/plural and also on two different extensions: www.beeswaxwebsites.com and beeswax.website  - splash page grammar is terrible: ""youwant a gorgeous website with no work"" and ""we got you covered"". You've just lost me. Again.  - example site has a menu link in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  That is very odd.  - ???? ""What’s the Catch? There is no catch!! (ok, there’s a tiny one)"" ??? Why would you ever write that?  It makes no sense. And it is misleading confusing.  - ""You can’t sign up or build a BeesWax website on a mobile touch screen."" You lost me a third time. Seriously.  Either recode things or quit while you're ahead.  It's 'the rule' nowadays to let people create content from any device.  - why wouldn't a customer just use http://www.weebly.com or any one of hundreds of other sites? - how can users auto import from their etsy account?  Shopify does this already.  Do you include at least etsy mini? - can customers use their own domain name? - that's a good start."

Etsy,3bctfg,PawedUp,2,Sun Jun 28 08:59:07 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion on this.... Your main website looks good on a mobile device pretty design. The example site is not mobile friendly at all which is a very big downside especially with Google seo changes that ding your site for not being mobile ready  I'm also not sure ( I'm not trying to be mean here so I apologize) why someone would pay $12 a month to have their sales redirect through etsy, ( who takes 3.5% of a sale) when you can set up a big cartel site on your own domain starting at $9.95 a month and have your items there to sell without paying etsy a %  The entire reason to get your own domain is to build your brand off etsy. To keep people on your site, to market to your own site. Sure in the short term it's fine to have your irk reroute to your etsy shop. But if you a re serious about your business you need to not out your eggs in one basket"
Etsy,3bctfg,figment81,2,Sun Jun 28 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Just seen that as well in my browser and phone. Doesn't scale and is not responsive. Considering if you're not ranking for any particular organic terms, that should be a deal breaker as you're most likely going to rely on social media which is mobile dominant. Pretty much everything is becoming mobile dominant. Better off linking straight to ETSY if the transactions are taking place there. No point in making another hoop for customers to jump through. Plus ETSY is more optimized for conversions."
Etsy,3bctfg,courtneyj,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.  A mobile stylesheet for individual shops was not part of our MVP, but we are expecting one to be out soon.  As far as concerns about Google's mobilegeddon, the only place it affects is smartphone searches (not tablets, laptops, or desktops)http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/04/faqs-april-21st-mobile-friendly.html.  It it is fairly straightforward to manually create a mobile site or stylesheet if that's an important feature to you (I just posted the example to show what an unedited site looks like)  Our platform is actually shopping cart neutral, we just start with an Etsy cart because our software is meant to create a seamless transition from Etsy to Website.  We have a paypal and a shopify integration, and can accept other shopfronts as iframes.  Big cartel is a nice platform, but you only get 25 items to sell for the 9.95 you mentioned, and after that the fees go up quite a bit.  Most of our seller on BeesWax have more than 25 items (some have many more).  Edited to add:  While Big Cartel may not charge a transaction fee per se, they process all of their transactions through PayPal, which does charge a fee.  The PayPal-only thing, in itself, is somewhat limiting to what kind of customers you can reach.  In conclusion:  It's very unusual to see any kind of e-commerce platform where you aren't paying for a transaction, somehow, to someone.  I know a lot about e-commerce, and I honestly can't think of any platforms that are completely flat-fee with no transaction charge.  I can only imagine that if such a thing existed, it would be pretty expensive (simply because merchant accounts cost money, and that money has to be recouped somewhere)."
Etsy,3bd7av,HisBlueberryGirl,6,Sun Jun 28 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"tom80's advice is good. I'd also add a couple of suggestions:  1. Stop marketing to family or co-workers. You're not going to build your store by relying on pity, and that's what selling to family and associates basically boils down to. Yes, they want you to succeed, but Etsy is a global market. If a significant number of your sales are coming from people you know, you don't have a product the marketplace is interested it. (Or don't have one anyone knows about.)  2. SEO. Research and revise. Develop a list of keywords to focus on. Include at last  one keyword in each listing description at least 3 times, but don't just stuff it in there. Be natural and tell your customers a story. Research your top-selling competitors and see what they are doing with keywords in their descriptions, titles, and tags.   And about tags; delete and rewrite them all. No one is going to find your items if your tags are ""rose,"" ""bride,"" and ""groom."" If I search for ""groom"" on Etsy, the chances that I'll be interested in a flower bracelet, much less find it from that search, are practically non-existent. Use long-tail tags relevant to each item, such as 'white necklace,' or 'silver cufflinks.' Focus, don't broaden. You want to find people who are looking for your specific item, not try to sell to everyone who has ever typed something on a search engine.  3. Pivot. What is your most popular item? Why is it popular? What do you have that is like it, or what can you make that is similar? Reinforce strength, and pivot towards the items that sell. Yeah, you love making jewelry, but if no one likes it, nothing you do will matter. Your customers will tell you what they are interested in. Listen to them and give yourself the flexibility to give them what they want."

Etsy,3bd7av,sneaky_dragon,2,Sun Jun 28 04:39:48 2015 UTC,Your tags need a lot of work. You likely aren't being found at all through Etsy SEO. They should not be one word and should match phrases in your title.  Read the Etsy Seller Handbook.

Etsy,3bd7av,tom8o,2,Sun Jun 28 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"which leaves limited time to get my social media up to par.   This shouldn't take longer than actually putting up a listing. When you add an item to your shop, post it to Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Get a little creative with the tags. It should only take a couple of minutes. Make it part of your workflow.  Edit: after looking at your site, because you have so much that could appeal to brides, definitely spend a few extra minutes on social media. #bride #wedding etc... Search for wedding stuff and look at their tags.  Extra advice: Take a look at your stats now and see how many people are coming from various social media sites, and keep an eye on it as you post.

So far I've seen a boost in traffic from reddit because of this post (thanks everyone) and also from Instagram now that I've posted a few items there. It isn't as hard as I was making it out but I see I still have a long way to go.
Etsy,3bd7av,cherryfristado,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"It's late and I'm on a phone... But here goes.  First rule of Etsy and selling anything online is to ""Make what people want."" After that: jewelry is a crowded market.  Flooded. And then some. And then some again.  It's going to be hard to stand out.  The only way to do that is to list a million variations and increase your quantity of listings. I've found that volume and variety pay more that ads or social media plugs. Social media is fine, but it takes a long time to build the audience. So pick away at it slowly.   Also - some of your lighting is wonderful - jewelry on a bright white and well lit background makes me want to look closer.  Earrings on dimly lit mugs - not so much.  Not that it all needs to be on a white background - any bright color will do.  However, Amazon requires that my first image for all items is featured on a white background.  So there might be something there. And I would look into building a simple light box.  It will do wonders.  Shipping. I would seriously consider listing items as $19.97 with free shipping rather than $17.00 plus $3.00 shipping.   There are some good articles on Shopify's website about the advantages of free shipping. You're on to something and have nice stuff.  Good luck. Hope that helps."
Etsy,3bd7av,hedera3,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I see what you mean about the free shipping.  That is something actionable I can correct this weekend.    I'm also really interested in your ideas on using quantity and variations to stand out. Do you think variations within the same item listing are better than the variety of listings available?  I tend to make only one of an item then try something else.  For an example of allowing variation within a listing, I could let customers choose silver/gold or pick a color of stone.  I have 1 example of that and it is getting more views than others but no purchases yet.  Could it be the shipping?...  https://www.etsy.com/listing/235334100/3-wishes-birthstone-bottle-necklace?ref=shop_home_active_14  As for the pictures I do have a light box, I got it in January this year.  All the items you see with plain white backgrounds are from that.  Earlier items were taken on my porch for the natural light.  I've always felt the stark white nothing pictures are hostile and clinical so I was using the cup (to hold the earrings in place) to give it some set dressing."
Etsy,3bd7av,cherryfristado,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can give that applies to any shop - good titles and tags, excellent pictures.  Read up on SEO and photography, if you carpool or ride public transportation that's a good time to do so.  From a brief look around:  You need more descriptive titles, some of them are missing color.  Include search terms that a buyer would use.  You should be using two to three word tags.  Tags with single words will land you at the bottom of search.  If I have the tag ""dangle earrings"" and you have ""dangle"" and ""earrings"" separately, I'll place higher than you in search.  Try to tag the way a buyer searches - multiple words.  Your pictures are better than average but they need to be more cohesive.  You haven't found a style yet.  Peruse successful jewelry shops like Holly's Five Little Gems to see what I mean.  She does the coffee cup thing too, but showcases the earrings better - in some cases you can't tell it's a cup, vase, or plate.  The best thing you can invest in for photography is a small 12"" light tent.  Try Amazon, that's where I got mine.  As for lighting, there are inexpensive lighting kits too, or if you already have an OTT light for working you can use that.  Let's take a look at this listing: https://www.etsy.com/listing/190922767  Here's the title: With Bells On. Matched set gold filled long earrings  Try something like this:  Gold Bell Dangle Earrings for Women, Blue Glass, Red Coral, Gold Filled, Boho, Long Earrings, Gypsy  Now your tags should reflect everything in your title.  ""gold bell dangle earrings"" is too long, so split it up ""gold bell"" and ""dangle earrings"".  Once you've used what's in the title, skim the description and see if there's anything there that you can pull for tags.  Your description is very clean and minimal, that's good.  A wall of text is intimidating.  You should link to related items in your shop; it will encourage browsing.  Get together an about page, use pics of your work space, supplies, and pics of you working if you can.  It will increase buyer confidence that you are the one making/assembling the jewelry.  That's all off the top of my head.  Good luck!  Edited to add - you can get away with an eclectic collection if you use the ""rearrange shop"" function to keep like items together, also if each collection is large enough you can give it it's own shop section to keep the browsing experience cohesive.  If you've got a goth necklace, be sure to put a link for the matching earrings and bracelet.  If you have a lot of goth items, you can do this:  Want to see more Goth inspired jewelry? (link to shop search)  To get the link, perform a search in your shop.  Copy the URL, it will be long:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/KestrelCollection/search?search_query=goth&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search  You can safely cut the URL right after the search terms like this:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/KestrelCollection/search?search_query=goth  Alternatively, you can go to bitly.com and get a custom etsy.me shortened link: http://etsy.me/1Nni9iG  For SEO purposes though, it's thought to be better to use the longer link."
Etsy,3bd7av,Christypaints,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the rearranging shop function. Where is it at? I get so irritated when my stuff isn't grouped together (entirely my own fault. Upload some clutches, oh yeah, I forgot about those car trash bags, finish listing some more clutches....)  I want all my listings grouped together, so that even if people don't click on the so section, they see all of the items together.  ..... unless that's not what it's for?"
Etsy,3bc1eu,aycockdesigns,2,Sat Jun 27 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"It would probably not help with Google SEO (Google prefers natural language, relevant content, and they're very smart about it knowing what isn't that).  Etsy is not so aware of keyword stuffing (they don't have AI countermeasures in place), and I absolutely have seen shops do this.  I believe it works to some extent, although any passive keywording isn't likely to drive as much traffic as an active technique.    The lower your keywords are down in your content, the less precedence they take, and the higher they are, the more distracting they are to human readers.  So use with caution."
Etsy,3bc1eu,skunkhaus,2,Sat Jun 27 20:13:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the good advice! I'll take that into consideration. My shop listings are already getting tons of search traffic... so I don't want to mess with it too much anyway!
Etsy,3bc1eu,armoreddragon,4,Sat Jun 27 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"Put tags in the tags section where they belong, that's what Etsy's engine is looking for. If you have more than 13 tags you want to use, spread them over multiple listings so different items show up on different searches. Don't be one of those annoying shops with extra tags stuffed into the listing and item name, it's distracting to buyers and looks unprofessional."
Etsy,3bc1eu,PawedUp,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:14:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, but only if it ended up hurting sales.  See this a lot w/ youtube videos stuffing keywords towards the bottom. Doesn't matter to much at all as long as the title is relevant and I got there for a search keyword that is in line w/ the video I was searching for. Ending up on a unrelated video that only appeared because the keyword was stuff into the bottom is annoying as hell.  OP. I don't know how many keywords you're wanting to use, but you could try duplicating a listing and adding a few extra keywords towards the bottom. Basically a split-test to see which gets more traffic. You might try searching google to see if anyone is doing this. I never see it recommended as a trick/tip to increase sales, but I'm sure that's because of what armoreddragon said. Shady in a sense."
Etsy,3baf09,mewk69,3,Sat Jun 27 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Scroll all the way down, under the tags there should be listed on date, views, favs, and the add to treasury link."

Etsy,3b7229,auntie-matter,2,Fri Jun 26 19:37:33 2015 UTC,What about sales from this?
Etsy,3b7229,RareBeautyEtsy,3,Fri Jun 26 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Eh, not amazing. My post was completely unrelated to my etsy stuff though, so it perhaps wasn't snagging target market. Just a lot of nosey redditors.  My jewellery-related /r/diy frontpage did a lot better for sales, although most not through Etsy (which is fine by me, no fees!)"
Etsy,3b7229,auntie-matter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Etsy,3b7229,RareBeautyEtsy,2,Fri Jun 26 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've had some of my busiest moments, getting linked through off Reddit. Definitely worth scoping out which boards might apply to your products. Easier for some I guess, but it can really pay off."
Etsy,3b7229,mewk69,5,Sat Jun 27 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"Internet high five for your solid win! That's awesome. The best I've gotten in trending in the Mother's Day section. Got 3 sales of said trending product in a hour and THEN started trending and got the fancy shmancy email saying so. I think I got ~200 views in the span of two hours. But I get around 150 - 300 views a day so it was awesome, but not nearly as awesome as this.   I think it did give me a boost up because that product has remained popular, sells at least once a day at this point, and I get a handful of traffic from the Trending Items, Jewelry Browse and Gift Ideas sections daily. And Craft Supplies Browse which is perplexing because it's not a supply at all."
Etsy,3b7229,Ktrgardiner,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:18:04 2015 UTC,Interestingly most of the hits to this item were from Etsy App and not from Etsy.com.  I am wondering if people accidentally clicked on it or if my thumbnail was somehow more prominent there.
Etsy,3b7229,Ktrgardiner,3,Fri Jun 26 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"I think the majority of mine were from the app too. Ugh. I really wish they had a traffic breakdown for the app stats like they do for the site.  I would love to know what percentage of my views from there are coming from searching vs. browsing. My completely unsubstantiated guess is that people who use the app are more window shopper-esque and browse through the trending, finds, etc. sections and people who use the site are more specific shoppers."
Etsy,3b7229,locustandplum,2,Fri Jun 26 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've been included in an email blast, yet.  My thumbnail was the top left on the Etsy Finds page so I am wondering if I got a lot of accidental clicks/favorites.  How does this compare to spikes you've seen from Etsy traffic?  Any success stories in taking advantage of the momentum? I made a few sales and have some more followers but I don't know how valuable it really was-- the product was a raw material and not a showcase of my work. I made sure during the traffic spike to curate only the best looking/relevant items to be featured in the top bar of my shop."
Etsy,3b7229,mojoman913,2,Fri Jun 26 14:24:10 2015 UTC,How do you actually get in those email blasts? Luck? Trending items?
Etsy,3b7229,hedera3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"No idea.  Etsy finds seems to be curated, my items are pretty highly ranked in some specific searches."
Etsy,3b7fnj,aycockdesigns,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"Etsy shouldn't count yourself as a view if you're logged in, I've never seen my views since I started Etsy in the stats.

Etsy,3b6zfk,Eponia,3,Fri Jun 26 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of cat and unicorn stuff sell really well on Etsy. I like the really colorful creatures the best, like the blue cat and the rainbow giraffe.   As long as the price is reasonable and the end product turns out nice, I don't see why they couldn't be successful. Of course, it is a very saturated category you're going into, so sales could be slow or inconsistent."
Etsy,3b6zfk,PoppycockGifts,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize that charms aren't exactly uncommon on Etsy but a lot of categories on there are pretty saturated I think. And this isn't something I plan on being able to make a living off of."

Etsy,3b6zfk,Phoenix_Fatechanger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Like the title says, these are designs I'm hoping to use for acrylic charms that I'll be selling on Etsy, I just finish getting them all together and colored and such the other night, showed a couple friends but wanted to show them to some strangers to get less bias feedback.  Basically, would you buy a key chain, necklace, earrings, pin, bookmark, cellphone charm, etc, with a charm using any of these designs?   Do you think they'd sell on Etsy?  I'm not necessarily looking for criticism on my style or technique, and these charms are only going to be about an inch to an inch and a half in size so I need to keep them simple. Too much detail on such a small scale will make them look busy, or the detail will just be lost.   But if you'd like to give feedback on a particular design or color scheme or what have you, feel free!  Also, obviously when they're made into charms they won't have my little watermark there on them. They will also likely have a black or white border as well."
Etsy,3b6zfk,Phoenix_Fatechanger,2,Fri Jun 26 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"I like the designs. I think whether they sell will partly depend on price and your keywords, as well as how the actual products turn out. Maybe make mirror images and sell a lefty and a righty as earrings? That's the only thing I'd see myself buying them as, I don't really use charms but wear earrings every day. If you do make earrings feel free to send me the link to your shop!"

Etsy,3b7fqx,MissMamanda,8,Fri Jun 26 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"The reason why I would still consider it handmade is because 1) artists can choose to do digital paintings/mock ups and such in lieu of a pencil or pen and paper.   It's simply their version of a canvas.   A computer program (even photoshop) can't make you a great artist, as you have to still be able to be proficient  in the program and drawing.   However, there are also plenty of items on etsy that are not ""handmade"" as they simply grab the image from the internet, change it a bit and then call it their own.   So it's both, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. :)"
Etsy,3b7fqx,saleina,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:20:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer.
Etsy,3b7fqx,pm-me-your-beard,6,Fri Jun 26 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"Whether it's hand drawn or digitally drawn it should still be considered handmade. The biggest difference is that digital art is a lot easier to reproduce and that is usually reflected in the price of the items.   This topic is actually very similar to the hand sewn vs sewing machine debate. They are both handmade, but one method is just more efficient."
Etsy,3b7fqx,IncrediblyEasy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you actually have to cut thread, tie knots and feed the material in the machine keeping it aligned by hand and so on, don't you?  I imagine there are automated machines of course, but those are not in the price level for most of the folks selling on etsy. Whereas if I use an electronic cutter, all I do is just feed it whatever it eats, paper, vinyl or some other stuff that one usually would feed it.  Well, of course, if I need a custom design, I'll draw it manually, but that's about it, you can make any amount of copies of that without continuous effort as in sewing.  This is not intended to say that sewing is handmade and paper cut with something else than by hand is not, just a comparison of work involved from my point of view."
Etsy,3b7fqx,nuclear85,4,Sat Jun 27 12:17:52 2015 UTC,"I sell paper items, and I definitely consider them handmade! I do many of my designs on the computer, but basically everything starts as a sketch on paper. For letterpress items, the designs are transferred to polymer plates, and relief printed on my hand crank press. It's a few steps away from the ""drawn by hand"" beginnings, but still absolutely a ""handmade"" item. I also do hand drawn original illustrations and lettering sometimes!"
Etsy,3b7fqx,mojoman913,3,Fri Jun 26 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"From the Etsy rules:   ""Handmade items must begin with the imagination and creativity of the member operating the Etsy shop. Sellers can use the help of other shop members, or outside manufacturers, to bring their visions to life."""

There are also a lot of other useful links in the sidebar as well for you to look at.   While we love to help and give feedback, it just feels so much better when the seller themselves have done a lot of their own research and made the first effort to make their shop great to the best of their ability. That way, we can focus on giving you more detailed and constructive feedback instead of really broad and simple things like ""fill out your shop policy"" (which you should really do, btw).

Etsy,3b51ww,FourPrivetDrive,2,Fri Jun 26 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I'll bite as I don't see that anyone else is.  Shipping large items can be a pain.  It's not about volume of items sold as much as the quality of what you sell.  And unless you make it yourself, it's hard to find a constant stream of items to sell.   That said, shipping big things can be done.  Assuming you have a truck, things will be much easier. The most common large item that I ship is 4'x4'x1"" - flat.  That I ship FedEx.  I have crated things up before, but that too will take a while to assemble the crate, load things in a pallet, weigh it and have it shipped by truck.    I stopped at a recent flea market last weekend and saw two old timers who were selling furniture. The wife wouldn't stop talking about things so I asked her details about how they refinish their items - quite simple actually. And then I asked about shipping and she told me that they often use Spot quotes - see spotmyfreight.com. There are many others.  She also said that they make a trip to New York City every 6-8 weeks.  Must be a rental truck or something.   Other thing to try is to learn from other furniture sellers in etsy.  Find a handful of sellers who you want to be like and figure out how they ship large furniture.  Act like a customer and see how they offer shipping options to their customers. Don't lead them or orb latently steal their write ups, but glean, glean, glean.   Good luck. Let me know if that helps."
Etsy,3b51ww,tom8o,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:49:06 2015 UTC,"My sister shipped a table that had been in the family for generations to me via FEDX. They broke it. Fortunately, she is an ace fixer of furniture and repaired it. Ended up driving it up with some other things I inherited in a pickup.   I would research the hell out of this and start with small items."
Etsy,3b51ww,shillyshally,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:33:05 2015 UTC,I'd look into freightquote.com or freightcenter.com  they've both been the oversized freight option on eBay
Etsy,3b3mng,courtneyj,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"I bought 5 cheap printables to see what quality/size other people were doing and got 9 cents back. Laughably small, but usually I buy more expensive things.  I love eBates though. I buy my makeup and clothing almost exclusively through Nordstrom and I've been able to get a good chunk back by waiting until there's 8% cash back there. I'll keep watching to see if there's a deal that fluctuates etsy cash back to a higher percentage.  It DOES NOT give you a rebate on anything you pay to etsy for selling though. Just things you buy."

Etsy,3b2rmu,atattooonmyvajayjay,5,Thu Jun 25 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Etsy is not currently full-time for me but having read various threads before where people discuss about leaving their day job, I've thought of some questions you can ask yourself to help assess the situation.   What do you do for your day job? I think it's important to take into consideration whether or not your day job is something you consider a career or a ""it makes me money to live off of"" type of job. Is money really tight for you? Will you be able to get by if you go a month with very low to no sales?  Think about if you had to stop doing Etsy a few years down the road, how would that gap look to a potential employer? Is it worth trying to find a part-time day job to maintain that connection in the event you want to return to your old career? How sustainable will your etsy work be in the long-run? Will it be something you can keep managing when you're old? Is it too much work for one person to handle? Do you plan to expand out of Etsy in the future? Do you feel that you are making enough profit for the amount of work you put it?   I feel that it may be better to hold off until after the swimsuit season to decide whether or not you want to take the plunge. You'd also be less stressed out by orders and have more time to think clearly about whether or not you can get through the low seasons with  what you make during the summer season. Crunch some numbers, tally up your working hours and how much you make to see whether or not you're making enough for your time. I think doing what you love is great but when it becomes your sole income source it can easily turn into something you start to dislike and get frustrated with if it doesn't do well. Good luck :)"
Etsy,3b2rmu,littletinypiranha,3,Thu Jun 25 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"If you feel like your demand is too high to keep up yet you're not sure if it's enough to be a full-time job, try bumping up your prices a little bit to see if it becomes easier to handle."
Etsy,3b2rmu,sneaky_dragon,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"There is a period of middle ground where you're working your typical 9-5 and then you come home to work all night into the wee hours of the morning working on your Etsy shop. I've seen a handful of people make the jump and it was only when their part-time (Etsy) income exceeded the income from their current full-time 9-5 positions.    With that being said, if you're working your butt off after your 9-5 and your income still hasnt exceeded your full-time income then one of two things: 1) You have a pretty solid 9-5 job and I'd reconsider leaving it :) 2) Your margins on the Etsy products aren't high enough.    If you're working from 6pm-2am every night after your full-time gig then you must reconsider if it's worth jumping to begin with. The people who I've seen make the jump are churning out profits each and every night so that when they make the jump, they are back to working the typical 9-5 hours again but for equal/more than what they previously made.    I've also seen people make the jump who spend an hour making an item for $10 profit. That will not lead to a comfortable way of living, but some people prefer to struggle and work for themselves versus working for someone else but at a sustainable job. It's all preference in that case...    This is just my two cents and I know I'm rambling so I'll stop there.    Goodluck to ya!!"
Etsy,3b2rmu,MJR08010,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"I have a really nice job. A career type job with great benefits and time to Reddit daily. It's hard to leave, but I'm sleep deprived and if I have one more energy drink my kidney's will explode.   And I'm really doing well with Etsy (my Facebook sales are pretty high too). I think my prices are pretty on point- my margin is pretty nice. I think I've decided I need to just tough it out a few more months, and maybe just ask for some help. If I could even get someone to cut orders so I can sew faster it would help and require almost no actual skill. I think letting my son cut my orders out over summer break would be a great help, and might even be a good experience for him too.   I've scheduled a sit down with my boss - I'm going to ask if I can go to 4 10 hour work days so I can have an extra full day to sew and maybe just prep on the other days. Or shift towards some more RTS items instead of customs. I don't know - I'm rambling too."
Etsy,3b2rmu,MJR08010,2,Fri Jun 26 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"Great ideas! Looking for some part-time help when you're home in the evenings is another way to slowly integrate towards ""the jump"". Using free help (a.k.a. your son) is by far the best idea yet! Use those resources so you don't burn out. You obviously have a great thing going, keep the momentum alive and expand, expand, expand! One year from now you'll look back and realize it was the best decision you ever made!"
Etsy,3b2rmu,bigblued,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"In my case, I had been doing Etsy off and on for a couple years before I decided I wanted to make it into a full time income.  At that point, I knuckled down a and created a list of benchmarks and goals.  It took about two solid years of creating new designs, posting at least 5 new listings a week, and regularly massaging my descriptions and keywords to get to a point where I could consider quitting my day jobbe.  This year my Etsy income was coming close to my day jobbe income.  I stayed on until I had enough saved up that I could cover 3 months worth of bills, even if I never made another sale.  I'm still not making what I made at the day jobbe, but my bills are covered, and my life is a lot more sane.  If you don't hate being there every day, keep the day jobbe for now. If you can stand it, stay there for at least one more year so you can get an idea what your annual cycle is.  Enlist your kids, family, friends, and neighbors to pick up some of the extra load.  There are a lot of people in your life who will be happy to help you succeed."
Etsy,3b2rmu,sirius_moonlight,2,Thu Jun 25 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"I think part of why I'm overloaded right now is this is my husbands busy season, he is a baseball coach - and the season is still in full swing. I may actually enlist my son in helping cut orders out though, that's not a bad idea. He hates traditional chores, but this could be something he could really help me out with."

Etsy,3b4vd7,BubbleButtUngaBungas,5,Fri Jun 26 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"Do you mean people on Etsy are asking you if you work or that other people are asking you if you work because they don't think of Etsy as a ""real job""?  If producing and selling your own artwork is something you feel passionate about and makes you feel good, you can still continue doing it on the side (if you do decide to get a job) so it stays an enjoyable hobby. I know it's easy to tell you to just ignore what other people say but it's hard not to let hurtful words get to you sometimes. However, the important thing is still to find something to do that'll make you happy and keep your spirits up, whether it be producing more art or something else entirely.   Etsy can be a very time consuming endeavour if you want to turn it into a full time job so relying on it as a sole income may not be worth it for everyone. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth it to still keep it as a hobby business. Keep your head up, don't let others get you down, and I hope you find your enthusiasm for creating art again :)"
Etsy,3b4vd7,littletinypiranha,-3,Fri Jun 26 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, people in real life are asking if I work. They really don't see Etsy as a real job. The fact that Etsy neglects to email me about their card readers like they said they would is also a red flag to me. I used to work for Target after I got out of the Navy, and they literally treated me like crap and tried to make me quit. I had to eventually move anyways, but I started my etsy shop so I could actually sell my art to a good home and I could finally get some personal space and not have to deal with people. When distant family members and random acquaintances ask if I work, I feel insulted and disrespected b/c then I constantly have to re-explain my etsy shop all over again and they're technically making me work when I clearly did not show up to their function to work and do marketing. It makes me question if these people are worth associating with if they're going to question me and judge me like that. Im single, no kids, I have an etsy shop, and I kind of wanted to keep it that way. The common demographic at my target nightshift was older people with kids who questionably may have made the wrong choices. I think Im also irked b/c nobody has actually bought my oil paintings. My first sale was the result of my dad guilt-tripping me into selling my best painting to him for only $70, and I hate that guy, but at the time I only cared about shuffling product out the door. Sorry about my rant."
Etsy,3b4vd7,courtneyj,3,Fri Jun 26 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"Etsy is only worth it if you have the time to put into it to get seen.  It is a lot of work, and selling artwork on there might be the hardest thing to sell.  Just tell people you're selling your artwork online. Don't try to explain Etsy."
Etsy,3b4vd7,OceanSiren,-3,Fri Jun 26 02:23:34 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, I do still have time. Probably just a lack of wider encouragement. My mom and brother and stepdad encourage me. Beyond that though, that's where the judgemental questions come from strangers and distant relatives. I had one relative who also has a fiancee' who sells art, who offered to do an art show with me, but I feel like I need to boost online sales first and then come up with new material. I feel like I have to also fix my promotional website as well before I can go through with an art show."

Etsy,3b4vd7,littletinypiranha,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"It's true that art (as in the original piece) is really difficult to sell on Etsy since the price point is usually quite high for someone to want to purchase online without seeing first in person.   To make things easier for yourself, you should look around Etsy to see what type of 2D art sells well and try to see if there's anything in that range that you'd be interested in. Things like smaller paintings (lower price point and also cheaper the ship) or even digital reproductions can all be things you can look into that may sell better."

I've been to events where I was the only handmade jewelry vendor and there were three direct sales jewelry vendors, with one directly across from me (thanks organizers). IF people are going to shop the market area, they will often cruise the whole place, then go back to what caught their eye. If they wanted cheap $5 jewelry, they could go to the Paparazzi table. If they wanted something unique and handmade with care, they could come to me.  People will be drawn to different things. The best you can do is display your items in an eye-catching way. Find a way to hang at least some of them up if you don't already because a flat table is boring. Check out Sassy Bliss Boutique on facebook. She posted a picture of her both on June 5th.

Etsy,3b0niz,mmm_ice_cream,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"Lol great, thanks!"
Etsy,3b0niz,iheartgin,2,Thu Jun 25 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"In terms of inventory, definitely think about which items are your best sellers and bring LOTS of those. I make jewelry, and i do a TON of shows. I usually bring 10 large, expensive, one of a kind pieces (pieces over $100). Then I bring 12 or so different ""mid priced"" designs -- but I bring three of EACH of these styles. (For me, mid priced is $50-100) And then, there my under $50 pieces. I try to bring as many as i have in stock. You never know what the ""hot"" seller will be at a particular show or day, so I just try to cover all my bases. I usually have a minimum of 5 of each of these ""low price point"" styles."
Etsy,3b0niz,ces614,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:45:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That makes sense. None of my items are over $14 so I plan on making a decent amount. Lately I've had a few people buy matching collar and bandana sets, so I may make a couple of those. My bandanas are a unique style and they're the item I started my ship with, so they sell the most so far--but that may just be because I've been selling them longer than the collars and leashes. Either way, I definitely plan on bringing a few of each size item in various patterns. :)"
Etsy,3b0niz,Nosrep,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:00:27 2015 UTC,Oh I forgot to ask another question. How much change should I bring? I'm including tax so everything is an even dollar amount. But for 9 hours... I have no idea how much I'll need in small bills!
Etsy,3b0niz,ces614,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"Usually I do $100.00 (if possible)   But with where your prices are, you would probably want a majority of ones, fives, and maybe some tens.   If 100 is possible then I would probably go with:   4 10's  8 5's  20 1's   100 seems to do really well, because it's not to little that you have to worry, and it's not to much either. But really it's all up to you and what you would prefer. $50.00 would be good as well!   2 10's  4 5's  10 1's   Something like that :)"
Etsy,3b0niz,bigblued,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I was thinking it would have to be a lot more. But okay good, I'll use that as a starting point!"
Etsy,3b0niz,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:43:56 2015 UTC,"100 is a pretty dang good number for an even till or cash drawer, without being to much or too little.   :)   I have used 100 in my years as being a vendor in some pretty big expos and conventions and have never had a problem with that amount. :)"
Etsy,3b0niz,skunkhaus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:14:21 2015 UTC,"Great!! Thanks! I work at a small business and we keep more than that on hand, but we have short bursts of a lot of people so... But usually we can get by pretty well on a little over 100."
Etsy,3b0niz,figment81,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:40:49 2015 UTC,"I also think $100 in small bills is a good starting point. You mentioned that your parents are going to come and help (for some of the hours), maybe have them keep an extra $20-30 in $1's and $5's to bring just in case you feel you are running low."
Etsy,3ayiq2,Vanetia,10,Wed Jun 24 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. I am person featured in this article. I am NOT a reseller. I hand make each piece MYSELF. I have never had help from a machine, other people etc. The holiday season is tough, especially around finals. I fell behind in the recent season due to this, however I learned from my mistakes and know how to navigate it for this coming year. I can fulfill an order in minutes, so taking a few hours a week to work gets the job done. It saddens me that people are quick to doubt and jump to conclusions."
Etsy,3ayiq2,lfs338,5,Thu Jun 25 05:29:20 2015 UTC,There can be some rather salty/judgmental people here. I think there's still some bitterness over etsy allowing certain types of business to run and that anger can cloud judgement.   I'm envious of your store :) congrats on the success as well as the feature in this article!
Etsy,3ayiq2,hebejebez,5,Thu Jun 25 13:06:17 2015 UTC,good for you. :)
Etsy,3ayiq2,figment81,7,Thu Jun 25 07:06:47 2015 UTC,You know I don't really think she is a reseller in this case. It's all wire wrapped which doesn't take much time at all to make a ring ( less than 5 minutes)  I'm sure in college too you have friend to help package orders for some beer money
Etsy,3ayiq2,PawedUp,3,Thu Jun 25 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"I hate to see someone get smeared as a reseller.  At least do a background check on alibaba to find the product(s) first (a few items).  I'm pretty sure shes legit. Good for her. Hats off.  Usually resellers don't allow for custom orders. I did check her sold items up to 5 pages and didn't see any custom orders done, but that doesn't mean they're not there.  That kind of output doesn't seem difficult given the type of item she is making.  Did check her instagram and didn't see her shop/work space pictures, but the above picture seems like that could be her work space."

Etsy,3ayiq2,affinityxxxx,2,Wed Jun 24 23:39:59 2015 UTC,Is there evidence to your comment? I'm genuinely interested.
Etsy,3ayiq2,tom8o,4,Thu Jun 25 00:14:13 2015 UTC,"11000 sales over 4 years is ~8 sales / day.  While that doesn't seem like a lot on any given day, there would be too many days where it would be an avalanche of orders. Think Black Friday level sales for a month before Christmas.  It's not really possible unless you are a machine. Or have a machine. Or have China. That's what imachocolatewaffle and others are getting at.  :) In other works: ""crushing it"" sounds good until you're the one getting crushed. She's got some help."
Etsy,3ayiq2,courtneyj,5,Thu Jun 25 00:33:21 2015 UTC,The kind of stuff she makes though you can make 8 in under an hour easily. The wire wrapped stuff you get your design down and then make a jig to quickly wrap the wire thru in a few seconds and then you just have to secure it around a mandrel at the right size. It's almost not worth it to resell this stuff because when you know how to make it you can make it so fast.
Etsy,3ayiq2,imachocolatewaffle,3,Thu Jun 25 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"It's actually 11600 sales over less than 3 years, (she opened July '12). Some of the stuff might be handmade but I doubt it."
Etsy,3ayiq2,imachocolatewaffle,0,Thu Jun 25 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"11600 sales over 3 years, I'm not good at math but I think it's  around 11 pieces per day.  In the article she claims to have done all that while attending school and working a second job. I'm not buying it.  Also, her star rating is at 4 stars which isn't bad per se but many of the reviews talk about her pieces being flimsy and of poor quality. hello China"
Etsy,3axy8d,aycockdesigns,4,Wed Jun 24 11:52:28 2015 UTC,A lot of people procrastinate. I don't see a reason why you shouldn't capitalize on that. It is really no different than ordering something online and requesting overnight shipping. You'll pay more for it but sometimes you need to have it tomorrow.   I think you should always offer the service.
Etsy,3axy8d,locustandplum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:19:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! Great input - my thoughts exactly
Etsy,3axy8d,chkadii,5,Wed Jun 24 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"This is strictly a consumer perspective.   On the one hand,  if you are swamped with orders,  I would appreciate the option to pay a convenience fee to be bumped up,  considering I do my best work in the 11th hour.    On the other hand,  I'd be a bit miffed if I had to wait for an order you could easily fill,  but didn't because you'd like to be paid more for the quick turnaround.     I suppose the compromise is a guarantee: ""This is my typical lead time for orders (let's say 1-3 days).   Paying $X guarantees it is done within 24 hours.  Those that order at the regular rate will still get their proofs within the 1-3 day window.""   I also think your wife has the right idea to continue as you have been for a little while longer.   It'll be perceived as much more honest,  and look better for your brand,  to say ""due to increased demand my lead time has extended to __ days.   To accommodate customers in need of a quick turnaround,  I am offering an additional ordering option for a small fee.""  As a sweetener,  maybe you could incorporate overnight shipping in the convenience fee? That way they'd be able to see more value in the charge rather than it being pure profit for you."
Etsy,3axy8d,chkadii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"Great response! Thank you. And as far as that last sentence goes...   Could you apply that when it's a digital product (that is not shipped, but only sent via email)?"
Etsy,3axy8d,badasimo,2,Wed Jun 24 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think I misunderstood your service.   I thought the proof was to confirm a design before you had a product shipped out,  rather than a solely web-based product.   If you were making physical invitations,  the arrangement would have been something like (random figures here) the customer paying $20 for the quick turnaround,  and you priority ship the invitations which costs $7-10, which leaves you with $10-13 and the customer doesn't have to worry about shipping separately.   It'd basically be you asking for a flat rate shipping fee but bundling it with the convenience charge.   However,  if you don't produce physical goods,  you can ignore that suggestion! :)"
Etsy,3axy8d,etourneau,2,Wed Jun 24 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"haha, that's fine! Yeah, I sell digital designs. It cuts out shipping all together. For those people that are DIY and like to print themselves, or go take it to the print shop."
Etsy,3axy8d,etourneau,2,Wed Jun 24 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing is for the customer to express their needs to you as easily as possible. I think whenever you get a 24 hour order you should message them straight away.  They are one of two things-- They are rich (and just want everything right away, and if you satisfy them they will spend more money at your store) or they are a procrastinator like the other poster says. By contacting them you will alleviate the stress they are having because they need something ASAP, and they will be more thankful and leave a strong review for you in the end.  In this case it's not so much about the product, it's about the customer's well being and satisfaction.    A lot of custom work is therapeutic for the customer-- these people can't make these things themselves the way you can, but they have a vision of what they want and they are trusting you to get it for them."
Etsy,3axy8d,Christypaints,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:58:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response. Very good points
Etsy,3axy8d,hedera3,2,Wed Jun 24 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"I offer the same service in my shop, though no one has taken me up on it yet.   I word it similarly to the way @chkadii suggests:  ""I'm typically able to fill all customized orders within 2 business days (usually sooner!) but if you're crunched for time, I offer a 24 hour rush option.""  Having a rush ordering option saved me a couple of times when I was planning my wedding, so I'm glad to offer it to others."
Etsy,3az03z,Superayaa,5,Wed Jun 24 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's too open-ended and I felt overwhelmed with options. If it were me, I'd add the fluff color and whether they want wings, tail or both as variations they have to choose when adding it to the cart and say to leave a note for the dragon color and eye choice. In my experience, anyone who wants something really specific will message you anyway."
Etsy,3az03z,bubuloobu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I wasn't sure if the variations would be a good way to go about it. I will try it :)"

Etsy,3az03z,k80k80k80,3,Thu Jun 25 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"When sellers ask for information to be left in a note at checkout, I love it when they word it as sort of a checklist that I can copy/paste and then fill in.   So for yours, you could word it as something like:  Wings [Y/N]:  Tail [Y/N]:  Dragon base color [insert color options here (at least list a few so people have guidelines)]:  Fluff color [options here]:   Horn/paw color:  Eye marble color [colors]:  Or, as bubuloobu mentioned, use your variations for things you have specific colors available for -- just list them to they can be selected from the dropdown."
Etsy,3az03z,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:54:26 2015 UTC,I think I will be adding variation to choose as well as incorporate your copy/paste idea. Thanks so much!

I don't know what the rules/regulations for things like that are, unless you're designing the print I guess.   I would rather not deal with that because it's just an added step to creating a product and getting it to the customer. That being said, I'm sure its a great idea for a lot of people."

I think you need to find a way to set them and show people how you can use them. like if you want people to hang them up in their living rooms, print out your picture and hang them up, or use photoshop to place your photos somewhere.   The colors and style you have are for stock photos, people like me love stock photos because we can edit the sh*t out of them so try and cater to that. Sell them as digital royalty free stock photos.   If you want people to hang them up in their houses you need to make them brighter, lighter and they should carry a message.

Etsy,3auw18,marctz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the late reply.  Yes, I do think the frames help a lot, if your are selling them as decorative pieces then I think it helps to make people understand what they can do with your product. I also think its important that you feel comfortable with what you are selling. Google image ""decorative and fine art photography"" and you will see what I mean about setting up your pictures, it makes a big difference when you see art hanging on a wall.    As a graphics designer who uses stock photos; the photos of flowers can be turned into postcards (would be nice if you could name the flowers also, for SEO reasons). The colorful love art is awesome, add a little bit of typography and you have yourself an awesome poster or postcard, but its also nice by itself! The New York city print would be something I would use for corporate web design and some of the other ones in the architecture sections also.   You dont have to add typography to your photos at all, its just a different target group. A picture does not need words to describe it. I think the prices you have are very reasonable."

It sucks though.. because people that have seen this done on pinterest or at friends' weddings search the words ""Instagram Wedding Sign"". Very rarely would they search ""hashtag wedding sign"" or ""social media wedding sign"". Oh well!"
Etsy,3au9nb,tom8o,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean you can't purchase ads with the work Instagram or that you can't link to you ad from offsite with the words Instagram wedding sign (Pinterest, etc.)"
Etsy,3au9nb,catsandnokids,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"What about in the tags so it's not on the listing itself but if someone searches for instagram it will come up, maybe?"
Etsy,3au9nb,maria_ivanovna,2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:50 2015 UTC,Using it in tags would still be considered trademark infringement.
Etsy,3au9nb,hysilvinia,2,Tue Jun 23 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"I actually emailed Instagram - and got a response such as this:   ""Thank you for your email. I do not know which listing was yours so I can’t comment specifically why it was reported, however, listings are generally reported to Etsy when the title implies affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement by Instagram (i.e. naming a sign ""Instagram Wedding Sign""). Use of the Instagram wordmark to name your product can potentially cause consumer confusion and mislead people to believe the product is somehow affiliated with Instagram.  It is acceptable to describe the product as suitable for/customizable for/works with Instagram, but try to avoid naming any of your products ""Instagram xyz.""   Listings may also be reported if the Instagram logo and/or wordmark is the primary part of the design rather than a seller's unique creation.  Instagram provides a useful document on what is and is not allowed when using Instagram trademarks. You can review it at https://www.instagram-brand.com/""  She basically said the title was the main thing they are concerned about. As I read through the link she sent me, I found more information regarding using their logo and other things."
Etsy,3au9nb,skunkhaus,3,Tue Jun 23 23:50:36 2015 UTC,So call it Instagram-Ready Wedding or something. They leave you a nice option.

Etsy,3au9nb,courtneyj,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"haha, I love this. Do I have permission to use this???"
Etsy,3au9nb,courtneyj,2,Tue Jun 23 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"From me, yes.  And inasmuch as it's intended as a parody you might have some legal standing to protect you from the powers that own Harry Potter.  I say, go for it."
Etsy,3au9nb,LWdkw,5,Tue Jun 23 21:43:26 2015 UTC,Instagram has every right to do this. In order for them to keep the trademark on their name they have to police the use of it and keep it from being used for non-company purposes.   FB does this also and sends C&D to anyone selling fb icons or using their logo on things because they have very exact specifications for the logo and what colors it can be in.   This is how they protect and keep their trademark and you will need to remove any mention of Instagram. I just posted this in another thread on here but please see point 2: https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/intellectual-property-infringement/22398703823
Etsy,3au9nb,tom8o,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. And I read all of that earlier. I made an extremely simplistic version of the Instagram logo... Doesn't have ""insta"" in the logo... and it's not colorized... that might be too much also.. .huh?   I guess I could replace that image with a camera"
Etsy,3atnw1,loudoobydoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:36:35 2015 UTC,Where are you located? There might be some laws applicable to you (e.g. of you're in the EU.)
Etsy,3atnw1,LWdkw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Okay... refund policies for artwork are a very touchy subject.  You should ensure your product is packed well, giving extra space in case of box damage etc.  If you do that, you can have your refund policy be on a case by case basis. Officially, you list no refunds. Then, if someone contacts you and asks for a refund for a reason you don't think is valid (for example, if they call you a few days after getting the package, saying it was damaged in transit), you can simply say ""no refunds"". The rare case where they show you that something horrible happened, you can grant an exception.  After all, you are the owner of your ""business""."
Etsy,3atnw1,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:45:56 2015 UTC,"Kinyutaka, thats really good advice. It feels fair enough whilst being protective. I recently had someone return something to me but I did it out of , well, being nice. But she knew what she was getting, the entire description and photos were there (this was on big cartel)  but she still returned it and I feel I was cheated out of a sale. But, I guess you cant please everyone.. However, I think your advice is sound, so I will give it a go.Thank you."
Etsy,3atnw1,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:59:01 2015 UTC,"If they simply return it, let's say they got it in their hands and decided they didn't like it, then it rarely hurts you to allow the refund. You may want to grant only the partial refund to cover your shipping costs (call it a restocking fee), and you can sell it again."
Etsy,3atnw1,littletinypiranha,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"You may have described everything perfectly but sometimes it just doesn't look the way they want it to when they see it in person. Unfortunately that's just how it is.   Also, when a customer wants a refund for reasons that are not your fault (e.g. ""I don't like it after seeing it in person"") then DO NOT refund the shipping cost or cover the return shipping cost. Whether or not you want to charge an additional ""restocking fee"" is up to you."
Etsy,3atnw1,OceanSiren,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, if someone files for damaged item received, good luck with your no refund policy because it will not stand. To protect ourselves as sellers from the very rare case that an item gets damaged in transition (provided that we ship with appropriate packaging), we have to buy insurance. We will need the buyers help to file for an insurance claim on damaged items in transit but we do have to refund the buyer or send the item again.   On the other hand, buyers remorse is a different story. You can choose to not accept returns. There are no rules about that."

Etsy,3at20u,sneaky_dragon,3,Tue Jun 23 15:43:58 2015 UTC,No. You can't use that word to advertise anywhere without permission. You can't say that the design is like X superhero.

Etsy,3at20u,The_Paul_Alves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:45:29 2015 UTC,Making it free does not negate the fact that you are using something that you have no right to copy. That is what copyright means.
Etsy,3at20u,The_Paul_Alves,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:51:56 2015 UTC,So fan art is illegal?
Etsy,3at20u,novapine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:51:47 2015 UTC,"You are correct. that answers all my questions, good thing i dont copy."
Etsy,3at20u,novapine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:01:54 2015 UTC,"Generally, yes, if you sell it."
Etsy,3at20u,RareBeautyEtsy,2,Thu Jun 25 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Okay. In regards to legality, making a print of a character has a few things you have to watch for.  First and foremost, is transformation. If you are simply copying an iconic Wolverine comic book cover, then you are violating both trademark and copyright laws. You didn't design the piece, you didn't design the character. It isn't yours to sell.  Second, is replicability. The more easily replicated the artwork, the less likely it will be sued over. You try to sell scribbled drawings of Wolverine on paper, and you'll probably be hit with a C&D. You make one 10 foot tall sculpture, and you probably will be congratulated by the artist (unless you piss him off).  That leads into the third point, flattery. If you make said sculpture with Wolverine being raped by Kitty Pryde, they'll come onto you like a hobo on a ham sandwich. If the sculpture depicts him in his iconic crouching pose with blades extended, they will look at it more favorably.  Fourth, and maybe the most important, is competitiveness. If you make a comic book featuring their character, then you are potentially cutting into their profits. Changes you make to the character can erroneously be seen as endorsed by the creators, which leads to problems. The aforementioned 10 foot tall statue, on the other hand, doesn't compete with their property. The people that would buy such a thing will probably be buying the legit art, too.  Now then, Etsy is in a strange position. They don't make anything, except the website. However, enough people are on it that they have to tread extra carefully to avoid C&D letters from the property owners.  Because of the points I laid out before, most companies are okay with the creation of fan art. They even encourage it. But if too much goes on in a site like Etsy, Marvel may come down on them.  In response to your question, superhero posters would be a definite infringement based on competitiveness. If you wish to fight a C&D for your work, you would likely lose, due to the fact that Marvel and DC sell their own posters of characters."

Etsy,3aqlbg,secrentagEnt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:58 2015 UTC,Hello!   Etsy: The Bomb: Luxury Bath Product  Working on getting different social media.
Etsy,3aod17,kiralovescats,7,Mon Jun 22 04:18:09 2015 UTC,"Its really not so overwhelming!  If you want or need an EIN, you can apply for one online. My bank required me to have one to open an account in the business name, which is something you'll want in order to keep your personal and business income/expenses completely separate (much easier to deal with come tax time).   These steps may vary by locality, but they all take place in the local court house. First I needed to register a DBA (doing business as), this is something you need to do unless you are operating under your legal name (this would be your Etsy shop name). Second I needed to go to zoning and have my workspace ""zoned"" for business (this can be a desk, a room, or a building; if you're renting, you'll need to bring the form to your landlord for a signature. I've lived in two apartments and neither had issue signing for me.) Third, I needed to get a business license. Doing all of the above takes an afternoon and requires you to walk from one room to the next; often the courthouse has a checklist for new businesses to guide you through it all. In my area, a business license costs $10 (generally $10 a year unless you're making $100k+ I believe), zoning was $75 (one time), DBA was $10 (one time) - these fees vary a lot by area, so you may want to make some calls to see what you're facing ahead of time.   Now, you'll want to stay ahead of the game tax-wise and prepay your taxes. It's a little tricky the first year because you don't have last years numbers to go by, but generally businesses set aside 30% of their income for tax purposes. To prepay, you need to apply for an EFTPS number, which you do online but you have to wait in the mail to get. I have them draft money each month so that come tax time I owe very little, if anything. If you don't prepay enough in taxes, you may face a penalty (I think they give you a year or so grace before enforcing the penalty).   My recommendation is to set aside an afternoon and knock it all out. There is such a paper trail between Etsy, Paypal, and your bank; it's not like a cash-only business where nobody knows what's going on! This way you can rest easy and take advantage of all the perks of business ownership :)."
Etsy,3aod17,trinaluna,2,Mon Jun 22 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the detailed response! This definitely helps.   You mention zoning--I haven't been seeing any of this in my (albeit brief) research on starting a small business in my state. Do you know if this varies from state to state? Or is it something that's required on the federal level?   One issue I'm having is that I just have NO idea what my year-end sales numbers will look like. I don't know how many people will decide to buy from me for the holidays... So I could total out to a little over double what I've made in the past 6 months, or for all I know it could be more... If I don't pre-pay taxes, that just means biting the bullet at the end of the year and paying them all at once, right?   What about sales tax? Do you have experience with that? I know you're supposed to file it quarterly or something; what's the process for doing that, if you know it?  One more question. I don't make a lot at my regular job, and I'm unmarried/no house/no kids/etc so I've never had to worry about things being deductible from my taxes; the default deduction has always been more than it would be if I were to try and do little things on their own. How will that work with the business side of things? Is there a default deduction for that too, or will I really just be individually adding up supplies/shipping/etsy fees/etc?   I agree, the obvious trail showing I've made money is what's making me want to do this the right way so I don't regret it later. It's just a little nerve-wracking, my taxes and things have always been so easy to do since I'm not tied down by much."
Etsy,3aod17,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Zoning varies city to city. Generally, you'll probably need a home business license.  Sales tax depends on the state. Google ""[state] sales tax"" and that should get some somewhere appropriate for reading.   How will that work with the business side of things? Is there a default deduction for that too, or will I really just be individually adding up supplies/shipping/etsy fees/etc?    You have to keep track and add up all the expenses yourself. Remember to keep all your receipts or if you get audited, you won't be able to claim the expense."
Etsy,3aod17,trinaluna,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"Zoning is one of those things that will really depend on your locality's rules. It's usually not an issue. If you're trying to run an adult or smoking related business, it may be an issue.  Generally speaking, the experts say to set aside 30% of your income for taxes. So, each transaction or week or month, take 30% of that and put it towards taxes. I've found 30% to be a generous number, but its a good starting point if you don't know where to begin. If you don't prepay your taxes, then yes, you'll have to pay the full lump sum come tax time in April. Earlier I mentioned the underpayment penalty, so be aware that you might face that if you wait (it's not a huge penalty, but still).  The rule on sales tax is that if you have a ""nexus""/physical presence in a state, you must collect sales tax for that state. In my state, I had to pay monthly, and after a year they sent me a notice letting me know that I could cut back to quarterly. My state has an easy to use online system (I login using my EIN) and requires the sales tax to be submitted by a deadline each quarter else I face a penalty there, too.  As far as deductions go, yes, its totally up to you to claim. This is where keeping a separate checking account for business-only transactions is key. It's as easy as running down your bank statement's columns and doing a general categorization of the expenses (business rent/shipping fees/software/raw materials/office supplies); be sure to research this because there are a bunch of deductible expenses that aren't so apparent. Basically, you have your gross income. You subtract your deductible expenses to get your net income. Your net income is what you are taxed on, so you'll want to claim every allowable expense you legally can to lower your tax liability.   I know it all sounds like so much, but stay organized and you'll be set :). You can still use tax software like Turbotax to complete your taxes in April, its just a matter of taking your income and expenses and plugging that in."
Etsy,3aod17,sneaky_dragon,6,Tue Jun 23 00:09:09 2015 UTC,"If you're doing it as a hobby, you just need to keep track of revenue and report it as extra misc income. Though don't take my word for it and ask your accountant.  If you want to be a real business to be able to deduct expenses like supplies and postage, you'll (eventually) need to go through the hoops of getting an EIN and paying for the appropriate licenses and fees.   Tax-wise, as long as you report the income and pay the appropriate income taxes, the IRS won't care that you didn't properly register.   Anecdotally, last year, I made some income and reported it on Schedule C, but didn't file for a DBA or pay for my city business license yet, but nobody came after me. I asked my accountant about it, and he says that only the state/county/city officials would care.  As for resources, look through sba.gov -- it's a fantastic resource. Your state's small business adminstration site should also help."
Etsy,3aod17,figment81,3,Mon Jun 22 06:13:57 2015 UTC,"You do not need an EIN as a sole proprietor you can use your ssn number. If you decide to get an employer you will want to then get an EIN ( but until then no need to do so)  As a hobby you are correct you do not get to write off or claim any expenses, so if you are looking to make money you will want to become a business."
Etsy,3aod17,figment81,2,Mon Jun 22 11:26:00 2015 UTC,"@sneakydragon if you have not already filed that back amount owed to the state or city you should do that ASAP. They will come after you for penalties.   None of these things are hard to register for, most of the time you can do it online. A dba usually is filed in person, you can call your city hall or dept or finance to find out where to file and how much it is, and be sure to register with your state to collect and remit sales tax ( if your state has sales tax)"
Etsy,3aod17,sneaky_dragon,2,Mon Jun 22 11:28:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the extra info! Most of it seems easy to register for, I'm just afraid I'm going to miss something...   So what things do I need to register for and in what order? (Not counting anything specific to my county) So far I know DBA, Sole Proprietorship (I didn't know that you don't need an EIN), and sales tax stuff. How does the sales tax work exactly?

Would you say there's a rough cutoff for how to determine that? I mean, obviously if I only made like 100 bucks in the year, then it's probably not worth getting all official over it. But is, say, $1000 in the year enough to merit registering for everything as a small business?   Thanks for the site--I'm going to keep looking into everything. I actually work for a small business so I've also been asking my boss for advice on the matter, although it's a vastly different business from my little ol' craft shop. ;)"

Etsy,3aod17,Musgojefe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like you generally need to pay self-employment tax on amounts of $400 or more: http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc554.html  I used Schedule C last year even though I was net-negative just to have the ability to write off my business expenses."
Etsy,3aod17,Musgojefe,3,Mon Jun 22 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"If you're making profits, yes you are supposed to include that as income when figuring your tax liability  you're a sole proprietorship.   Don't make this hard on yourself.   You do not need a federal ein because your social acts as your tax number, you don't have any partners or employees, and you're not incorporated.   But you could talk to your tax advisor to discuss your specific situation.   The easiest way to keep stuff straight is to open a special checking account just for this.   All expenses are paid out of it, and all income goes into it.  And keep receipts so you can document expenses.     If it turns out it's losing money every year, do be aware that the irs classifies a hobby differently than a business.   What they don't want is someone writing off every little expense, not making profits, and basically getting their hobby deducted.   So if you expect to not ever make profits on this, it's a hobby.  If the goal is to make profits and you start to in a few years (3?), tax wise it's a business.   The good news is that you can deduct all sorts of things related to your etsy shop.  Vehicle mileage going anywhere related to the business (picking up supplies,  taking boxes to be shipped).   If this turns into a serious business you could declare your workshop and all expenses related to it (for example portion of utilities and rent)."

I use my SSN instead of an EIN, but if you don't want to give your SSN out to Etsy and Paypal getting an EIN is free and super easy to do.   I got a free business checking account and spend $10/month on GoDaddyBookkeeping which spits out a year end Schedule C form for my taxes.  I file my taxes like normal and turbo tax walks you through it all, including the schedule C portion where you file your other income.  The only other thing I really need to remember is paying sales tax to my state which is around the 1st of the year, and they'll email me updates from the state dept of revenue."

As to following and unfollowing, I follow my team members, but when I get to where I can no longer follow new people, I will unfollow my team members. I LIKE the shops, and periodically go and unlike/relike them, and then will like the first page, or 10-20 items. It helps!  But people that follow and then unfollow? That's pretty bad."

In the end for these people i think it's a numbers game-- they show up in my dashboard and even 1/10 of people click on them, that's a little extra exposure, completely for free. I can't really see the downside to it, except that it makes it more difficult for them to have a meaningful community presence."

At first I thought it was just one of those ""Hey come look at my shop"" type of follows because he has tons of favourites and such, but he also has tons of followers. Every so often he comes to my shop and favourites one or two things and every time he does I notice those items get more attention. Instead of just following relevant shops to get his some attention, this guy goes out of his way to spread the love a little."
Etsy,3aprgj,RareBeautyEtsy,2,Tue Jun 23 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why sellers would follow/unfollow you. Maybe they see you liking things, want you to look at their shop, and then unfollow you if you do not purchase?  Some people have maxed out how many they can follow, so it makes sense to only follow those that buy from you. Not sure how following a buyer helps, unless the buyer has a blog. (No shop)  I unfollow anyone that has their favorites set to private. (As a seller, private favorites do me no good) Until I reach my max, I do not unfollow anyone for any other reason."

Etsy,3aoibg,PawedUp,2,Mon Jun 22 16:12:57 2015 UTC,For 5 months it was worth it to me. I made over 50 sales from it.  Now people are just clicking on the ads and not buying anything.
Etsy,3aoibg,locustandplum,0,Mon Jun 22 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"I don't deal w/ anything ETSY just yet, so I don't know much about their backend for their ads system.  You might research ETSY's guidelines somewhere out there and see if they charge for multiple clicks from the same person. I'm sure they wouldn't charge if someone just clicked over and over. What I mean is that they should be a smart enough company to deal w/ that. However, if someone clicked @ 6am, then another @ 7am and so on throughout the day/weeks/months. Maybe they don't dig too much into that.  If someone was to change their ip, drop their cookies, and/or use a proxy system setup for the sole purpose of screwing competitors by clicking their ads, then that's more complex and they might not have a system to deal w/ that. I think googles ad system has a way to tell if the user is an actual person and not a bot. Not sure if they do this by time on site or if there is some way they can check movements other than just moving from page to page.  Hopefully someone can give you some better feedback. I would go straight to ETSY though and see what type of monitoring system they might have in place in regards to people that do the above. IF they even get back w/ you or give you an accurate answer."
Etsy,3ap6o0,locustandplum,2,Mon Jun 22 11:07:51 2015 UTC,"international shipping can be difficult, because depending on where you ship the shipping costs can be more expensive.   However, opening up yourself to international shipping can definitely get you more orders!   I have shipped internationally for my website from the moment I began.   Yes, it is most costly however you are able to charge more for shipping to cover that.   I tend to ship first class on small objects on my shop, and let the customer know that I have added a proof of delivery.   I have heard that etsy's shipping labels are actually more expensive, so just going to the post office would be your best best, especially if you decide to send first class.   Sometimes priority is totally worth it though. From what I remember, priority shipping will cost roughly 23 dollars to ship to everywhere (excluding Canada, they are a bit cheaper) but that does include the UK  First class shipping however, does it based on weight, and the size of your own packaging. So I can then ship out something for about 8 dollars instead of 23.   It definitely has it's pros and cons.   You also want to keep in mind that many countries have VAT or custom fees, that you should add to your policies that you are not responsible for these fees in anyway, and the customer should find them out before they purchase something.   There are a lot of different things to consider,   However my experience with International shipping has been really great. I usually get anywhere between 20-30 orders from Canada, UK, Australia a month.   :) Good luck!"
Etsy,3ap6o0,saleina,2,Mon Jun 22 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, etsy's international labels, as well as domestic, are cheaper than the post office. Etsy shows you the post office price right next to their price. I always use first class international.  I have noticed, however, that sometimes you do overcharge by $1-2 to some countries if they are in the category of ""everywhere else"" and do not have a specific price associated. I've always refunded this with no issue, and no complaints.  Good luck!"

Etsy,3ap6o0,hysilvinia,2,Mon Jun 22 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"1/4 or more of my orders are international. You should look up import restrictions because you can't send anything anywhere, mainly things like precious metals I think.   My approach to shipping is that I have it set high in the listing and I say in each description to please send me a message for international orders and I will calculate it. However, most don't do this. It's better to have it set high than have it low and have them order it leaving you paying the extra for shipping. Some people do message me and I can usually lower it a bit before they order."
Etsy,3ap6o0,littletinypiranha,2,Mon Jun 22 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth looking into shipping internationally. If it's something you don't quite feel comfortable with doing yet, you can start with a few countries first. Canada is usually a good place to start if you're in the US (or vise versa).   Depending on what you're selling you should definitely look up whether or not you can send your item to whichever country you want to as there will be restrictions that will vary country to country."

I can't remember for sure but it would be a good case to look up. (I just quickly googled ""is the mona lisa copyrighted"" and lots of interesting articles pop up).  After 1923 it becomes more complicated. Searching copyright.gov would be a good place to start. I've never done it though so I don't know how complicated it is.  I also consulted r/legaladvice and a couple lawyer friends to make sure I was covered, but 1923 and before is safe territory."

I also buy my bare yarn from the UK (go figure the worlds biggest supplier of merino wool has no spinning mill willing to supply me) and its an extremely shitty exchange at the moment. Over $2 to the pound.  At least I'm getting a few overseas orders because my prices probably look extremely favourable even the postage looks alright to people.   I wish it would go back to 95cents to the usd and a dollar to I think it was 60p.   Oh and PayPal exchange rate is completely different and even more shit. Handy when paying suppliers -.-

Etsy,3akyal,unintelligentnothing,5,Sun Jun 21 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"Example Item: https://www.etsy.com/listing/176669769/gradient-blue-wrap-bracelet  ~LISTING INFO  You should list the size of it. Maybe also do a size comparison in the images. Add more linebreaks and bullet points of the features/materials/ETC. People want to know what they're buying, let them know.  ~TAGS  You're not using all the tags. Your tags are also for irrelevant stuff like, ""button"", ""clear"", ""flower"", etc. Instead, add bracelet in front of those words, like ""button bracelet"", ""flower bracelet"", ""rustic bracelet"", ""blue bracelet"", ""willaddmoreyearstoyourlife bracelet"" , etc.  You can also replace ""bracelet"" w/ ""jewelery"". Jewelery is the broad niche, bracelet is the targeted niche. Bracelet is the more important word, but jewelery is the best secondary word. Unless your bracelet can also be used as a necklace/choker/ankle bracelet. If it can, then try to target that somehow. Maybe make another listing promoting it as a necklace/choker/ankle bracelet instead of a bracelet, but using the image differently. Would be best to take a picture of the product in use on neck/wrist/foot/ankle.  You could also promote it as cat/dog jewelery. The possibilities are endless.  ~TITLES  Your title: ""Gradient Blue Wrap Bracelet"" I would do something like ""Leather Cord with Blue Acrylic Bead Bracelet"". Try to fit jewelery in there somewhere.  ~IMAGES  The images look good. You might add more images w/ varying backgrounds. I would also set up some pin accounts and try using social media to promote them if you haven't.  As stated above: ""Would be best to take a picture of the product in use on neck/wrist/foot/ankle.""  Some people have dry imaginations and can't picture a product on a specific body part unless the picture is taken of the product on that specific body part.  ~ETC  You might try researching relisting/renewing products. Find the pros/cons of this and if you might be interested in investing that extra money in hopes of generating more sales.  ~PROMOTIONS  You might try a start promotion just to get more sales in. Say 10-20-XX % OFF as part of a July sale. This way you're able to get sales in hopes of getting reviews/star ratings. People look @ this as an indicator of ""trust"" or ""value"". Some people have their reasons and might not order from a shop w/ little or no sales/ratings. Just don't shoot yourself in the foot w/ pricing. At least this way you can get the feel for shipping out more product if you haven't ever done much on the shipping side.  ~MEH  You started last year and only got 1 sale so far? Have you been selling them outside of ETSY? I assume so, I wouldn't be mass producing w/o an avenue of getting rid of them.  ~DOUBLE MEH  There is really so much you can do w/ your ETSY listings. The big part is offering something not very many stores are offering (styles/designs/ETC).  There is soooooo much more. Listings are like art."

Etsy,3akyal,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"Love the bracelets! My only comment, which I totally don't agree with, is a large company went through Etsy and had a ton of wrap bracelets removed, or sent legal letters to sellers threatening a lawsuit. I personally think it was total bull, as this style has been around forever and seems like the equivalent of trying to copyright knitting or something, but apparently they had a lot of success in removing sellers or items. The company was Chan Luu, if you do a google search of them + etsy/copyright, it should show a few threads in the Etsy forums of sellers who were affected.   To reiterate, I don't agree with it at all and think your items are gorgeous and original, but I figured a heads up might be useful."

I have a few items in that category and all of my jewelry has traditional metaphysical associations listed in the description. I received a few notifications this week but nothing was taken down.  The thing is all about not promising a result... Just like you could never sell ground up seahorse and say that it will make you more virile, now you also can't sell a yarn doll and claim it'll make an ex boyfriend die... but I'd bet you could get away with selling a yarn doll that ""has traditionally been used in casting of spells for _____ purpose."" along with an instruction guide.

Etsy,3ad2gm,GenericHamburgerHelp,2,Mon Jun 22 06:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think what they're doing is massive overkill for those purposes though.  Obviously remove the people selling bottles of water claiming they ""WILL BRING YOU LOVE"" thats stupid, you're absolutely right.  No one deserves to be scammed.  Removing incense and herbs and roots and spell kits with a legitimate cultural and religious history behind it for hundreds of years, I think is wrong.  If the seller can prove that the items used to make the hypothetical ""love potion"" are actually the traditionally used ingredients, prepared in the traditional way according to some world religion, I think it should be able to be sold.   People are getting their stuff taken down even with ""This item is for novelty purposes only, it is a curio and should not be taken seriously"" disclaimers. Etsy is banning anything that has any religious connotation. (You know, unless its christian, then its fine)  I feel that I should be able to buy a lucky rabbits foot if I want to, or some dragon's blood tree resin incense, or a voodoo doll, etc.  Obviously I'd much prefer them to be high quality and hand crafted and reasonably priced based on the physical objects I'm getting rather than the supposed powers, but to just ban them all together and wipe out every store seems like a poor move. I don't want to have to go to some shady site to get stuff I want. (seriously, the next leading place to get anything is a really shady site called LuckyMojo who has scammed me every time I've gotten something from them and charges exorbitant prices for everything)"

To answer your completely asinine response to me: No I don't want a rabbits foot, but if I did, rabbit's feet are harvested from dead rabbits to be used as meat. Many countries farm, hunt, and eat rabbit regularly.   Rabbit is a vermin animal, and many parts of america and pretty much all of the UK eat it. Most of Europe does too.  No one is eating pet lop bunnies, they're different species and I'm so sure now that you're just a troll or really dumb that I won't be responding to any more of your replies."

Etsy,3ad2gm,AgentFreckles,15,Mon Jun 22 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"I find it hilarious that people bought ""metaphysical services"" on Etsy in the first place. But taking down Pagan woowoo and leaving up Chrisitan woowoo isn't really fair.   Most of the actual, physical products can probably still be sold, just the wording would have to change. Instead of ""this stone grants protection"" or ""this herb restores harmony to the soul"" a seller would have to provide a physical, verifiable description of the product being sold, then they can go on to say ""this candle is pure beeswax so it can be used in rituals x,y,z in the hgikfsd tradition"" or ""was believed by the Druids to do x, y, z, and was used in their healing rituals"" or something along those lines, I really don't know. I'm not heavily invested in this, just my 2 cents."
Etsy,3ad2gm,poxteeth,4,Fri Jun 19 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"I assume this applies to jewelry sellers who claim certain stones have healing properties. I feel like I see that kind of thing a lot.   In the business world you're not supposed to make claims you can't back up - I think Etsy is just covering their tail and I think that's fine. If a jewelry company makes a necklace and claims it ""cures cancer"" you best believe they'll get in a sticky situation. (I do know that's a more extreme case)"

This is an issue of tolerance and respect that other social and religious groups already get from both society and the law.

Etsy,3abtk4,jbbnorth,4,Thu Jun 18 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, those fees are pretty high compared to Ebay or Etsy. Does anyone know how they compare to normal Amazon seller fees?"
Etsy,3abtk4,sneaky_dragon,4,Thu Jun 18 21:31:04 2015 UTC,Significantly less than the average 20-50% charged according to category.
Etsy,3abtk4,sortika,2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"There is an option on Amazon to upgrade to a professional seller's account for about $40 a month plus the percent commission. So if you use a professional account and sell in the 11%-20% commission categories (video games and books among others), it's comparable in that regard. Non-professional accounts also get charged $1 per item sold in addition to the percent Amazon takes."
Etsy,3abtk4,PoppycockGifts,4,Sat Jun 20 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit skeptical that she was really accepted to ""Amazon handmade"" I think she was accepted to sell her work on Amazon ( as those rates are the current Amazon rates for her category)   And of alllllll the people that sent in information, I don't think she would be the first and only person to post about this in the forums.  If you read through I think she a little confused."
Etsy,3abtk4,figment81,2,Fri Jun 19 11:26:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, maybe. She said she talked to someone on the phone and how the amazon person said he understood that handmade takes longer so they wouldn't be able to have the fast turnaround that amazon usually requires. Made it sound somewhat legit to me. It's still wait and see I guess."

Etsy,3abtk4,locustandplum,2,Sat Jun 20 14:59:19 2015 UTC,When does this launch?
Etsy,3abtk4,jamesc7,2,Fri Jun 19 11:12:44 2015 UTC,Not opposed to that price if they can deliver some good organic traffic.
Etsy,3abtk4,Ktrgardiner,7,Thu Jun 18 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Which they definitely can. But can they deliver good customers? That's the thing I'm wondering. People buy from Amazon because it's cheap, fast, and incredibly generous and very ""The customer is always right always always always"" when it comes to customer complaints. Hell, today I chatted with customer support because my same day delivery was not actually delivered the same day. So they gave me a free extra month of Prime. Which is great, totally above and beyond, and that's why I love Amazon. But are people going to expect the same from Amazon Handmade? It's the answer to that question which makes me hesitant."
Etsy,3abtk4,madxstitcher,2,Thu Jun 18 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"""The customer is always right always always always"" when it comes to customer complaints.    This is exactly why Amazon is as huge as it is.  Negative reviews on customer satisfaction will hurt a company way more than having to eat the cost of free Prime subscriptions, or sending out free replacements.  Happy customers come back, so the money they lost just comes right back in almost immediately.  I imagine, without being able to really find any info on this, that Handmade will be treated like the Marketplace.  Even if it's a third-party seller, it's ultimately still Amazon's name on the line.  I had weird dealings with Marketplace sellers in the past, which Amazon made better with a Band-aid of free stuff."
Etsy,3abtk4,tom8o,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:03:57 2015 UTC,My question remains - will they require a unique bar code for each variant as they do right now.  I'm for anything that streamlines selling on Amazon.  It's a bit of a pain right now. Looking forward to the potential audience and opportunity.
Etsy,3abtk4,plasma2002,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:08:23 2015 UTC,"No, they will not. They are making the handmade marketplace as a means to NOT require the barcode.   But if you dont want to wait for this, barcodes are cheap at NatiowideBarcode, go get some and start selling like normal on Amazon"
Etsy,3abtk4,ashmaster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:44:34 2015 UTC,The fee's are extremely high compared to Etsy. I think whatever they were trying to do will not work with those fee's.

Etsy,3ad58t,sciencenerd86,4,Fri Jun 19 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, putting my shop on vacation mode brought it to a screeching halt and took months to get back to where it was. I personally would just change the process time, change your shop banner, and your order confirmation note and make it the first sentence in every listing. People tend to not read things so you have to splatter it everywhere. But the 10 minutes it will take you to do all that is far better than losing all those precious views."

Etsy,3ad58t,ashmaster,3,Fri Jun 19 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common for small online shops to take a few weeks of vacation a year. Every time I've run into it, there's just been a friendly message on the home page announcing their vacation. And usually, it's such a small delay that I probably wouldn't have even noticed it if they didn't announce it.  I've waited more than a week for items to ship even when the shop owners weren't on vacation."
Etsy,3abgbj,briekachu,2,Thu Jun 18 19:11:48 2015 UTC,I printed two different receipts and neither gave me any new options. Is this change available for all sellers? I always print a packing slip to put with my orders. I think it's more professional and it helps ensure accuracy.

Etsy,3abgbj,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:35:24 2015 UTC,I wish they had the option to fully style your receipts. I copy all of my information into another program to include invoices in packages and my life would be so much easier if I could just print with that styling. There used to be a plugin for Chrome where you could put in custom CSS/HTML and it would overlay it on the receipt page so you could basically style it however you want but whoever made the plugin was hired by etsy and forced to stop making it by the time I found out about it.
Etsy,3abgbj,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:14:41 2015 UTC,Aw. ): That's rough. I use Firefox for one shop and Chrome for the other shop right now.   I actually just got in an Etsy order the other day (something I purchased) that looks to have their packing slips done in quickbooks and I think it looks pretty professional as well.   What program do you put your information in? Could you show an example for my curiosity? (: I've thought about making a Photoshop document that fully matches my store to go with the order - but I think it would end up using too much ink and time to be beneficial for me.
Etsy,3abgbj,ashmaster,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"I use Adobe InDesign that has a layout of the receipt and then I copy and paste their shipping info, date, order number, and then the items and pricing. I'd be happy to show an example but I'm not sure how! (New to reddit)"
Etsy,3abgbj,auntie-matter,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:59:35 2015 UTC,I really like this change. I didn't know how to print packaging lists before and this will save me from ever forgetting anything on multiple orders which i get a lot as i sell supplies.
Etsy,3ad6za,UU_Bunnyman,4,Fri Jun 19 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"Is this your site? Because that's what the URL on the back of your card leads to.   When you get the chance to you should really print some sample cards. As a buyer I would be more convinced by a picture of a real card than a digital picture. You don't need to make one for every single one per se but it's definitely helpful to print a few so that your customers can get an idea what the real quality will look like (card + envelope).   I think it'll also help to describe the type of paper you're printing on, the printing method, and just any other material information. Is the paper matte? is it glossy? is it thick card stock? is it recycled paper? is it textured? is the envelope self sealable? is the ink raised?   I don't understand SEO completely myself either but apparently you want you title and tags to have keywords that are the same so that it appears higher in searches.     Also, fill out your policies as well as any other information you can fill out about your shop and/or yourself."
Etsy,3ad6za,littletinypiranha,2,Fri Jun 19 04:28:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is helpful. I'm having samples printed right now and will definitely take some photos to enhance the galleries. Tomorrow I'll add a bit more description of the materials.
Etsy,3ad6za,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I also sell stationery & cards and you have to be super clear and up front with the paper and envelopes used, and a photo of the card itself is pretty essential. You'll see a ton of shops just uploading the design itself but buyers want to see the actual product. With titles and tags, when you have phrases that are in both then search engines rank you higher for that particular search because it's an indicator that it's a more relevant term."

""Sexual activity or content, profane language or graphic violence"" is what https://www.etsy.com/help/article/4527 says.

They are giving zero explanations both in the forum or to sellers directly, but Im assuming/hoping it had something to be with coding.  I posted lots of thoughts on this last night, along with lots of stories from the old times to show why I am so bothered by this, but deleted it because I don't want any blowback, but people need to be slightly aware of this. My shop turns ten Dec 6 and I have no real confidence tha t this 'bug' or whatever it was, will have been actually fixed. People have lost feedback, sales numbers, followers... everything they have worked for for a decade. Some of these sellers were literally the first ones featured in all the old 'quit your day job' and Storque articles. Shit so old, I'm sure 80% of this board isn't even familiar with what I'm talking about. Its super bizarre."
Etsy,3aawhm,courtneyj,4,Thu Jun 18 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Etsy gives almost every developer the right to make any coding change to the live site at almost any time and takes on the thinking that a failure in this is bad, but that it won't be harshly punished (which in IT is good! and agile! so don't take that the wrong way) so it's actually super easy to imagine this happening and it not being retaliation."

I remember rob white, amazing he's still there too when so many of my faves (ie Jared) don't seem to be anymore.  I have my 10 yr anniv in weeks & am shocked at how they forgot their longtime sellers- so much so that a bug like this could even happen. they didn't use this as an opportunity to highlight the longtime shops who shaped Etsy's entire culture. etsy wouldn't exist without the early shops who built its audience and aesthetic.  and the saddest part is when you read Lynda's initial post about her shop closure, she feels like she may have gotten shut down on purpose for violating some obscure tou.  so sad that you can build something for 10 years and they can detonate it like that and there would be nothing you can do."

I think etsy is really trying to also protect its sellers as well, by only letting in select buyers who's shops fit in with etsy's ideal customer. They want to make sure you are not a scammer or someone who will take advantage ( in many ways) of a shop and their work.

I can still send them the line sheet, but when they're ready to purchase, I'll just send them a PayPal invoice instead and take care of the transaction through them. I'm already offering the items at 50% off, so the less fees I have to pay, the better.   I know this doesn't really help your situation, but just wanted to chime in from the other side. :)"

One of my chief concerns is that with the introduction of a formal wholesale platform, my account would be put at risk for trying to circumvent it.  One of the reasons I was still looking forward to it is because many Etsy shops do not have a line sheet. While many are willing and prepared to engage me at that level, I find that I have to walk many shops through that process.  And that's a fine line to travel, since I do not work for them. It is tiring to have to explain and justify without tarnishing the line of dialog because they don't know how B2B relationships work."

I totally understand what you mean by your work being hard to photograph; it must be really difficult to show your customers all the different layers that go into making the larger picture. A suggestion that I have for you that you can try doing is taking a picture of a ""work in progress"", before you've put it into the frame. If you take a picture straight from the top without the frame, it can further highlight the number of layers that go into making the picture and may make a pretty cool photo."

Customer emailed me (after ignoring my friendly little personalized ""hey thanks for ordering, plz send pictures of your dog!"" email) saying that the item did not fit her dog and she didn't really want to have paid for something she couldn't use. Nevermind the fact that my listings VERY clearly have all the measurements included in both the description and the pictures... So I wrote back with a very polite ""I'm sorry, what about the fit isn't working for you? If you send it back I can give you a refund, or we can work out an exchange if you'd like to try again"". For weeks I was afraid she would ignore me and just leave a bad review, because she never wrote me back. But hey...It's been over 2 months and I haven't heard a peep, and meanwhile all my other customers have been absolutely wonderful. :) Don't let the iffy ones get you down too much!"
Etsy,3a89pu,FusRoDahMa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:58:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah I never heard back from her, its only been 3 days though."
Etsy,3a89pu,madxstitcher,4,Mon Jun 22 07:34:20 2015 UTC,"Good!  One bad review in a list of good is frustrating. However, she will most likely come off sounding like a crazy B and people will know it's a fluke, if she even does leave a review. Plus you can make a comment on a bad review, just make it very neutral and stand by your work. I hope it works out!"
Etsy,3a89pu,iheartgin,3,Thu Jun 18 02:20:08 2015 UTC,You can also write to Etsy's customer service and have a bad review removed if you can prove it was malicious / incorrect.
Etsy,3a89pu,madxstitcher,2,Thu Jun 18 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"A few poor reviews are expected, from a buyer's point of view. If you've got five reviews, and they're all five stars, that's pretty normal. If you've got 50 reviews and they're all five stars, I might wonder how many of them are legit."
Etsy,3a89pu,falc0nwing,2,Thu Jun 18 03:04:52 2015 UTC,I would think the opposite. It would be tough to fake 50 reviews. Full disclosure: 3 of 4 of my reviews are from my friends; the last is a complete stranger.
Etsy,3a89pu,Vanetia,2,Thu Jun 18 03:16:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe not faked, but they can definitely be bribed. Just a few days ago, there was a thread about offering coupons to people who leave reviews, which can very easily be seen as bribery for reviews."
Etsy,3a89pu,FusRoDahMa,5,Thu Jun 18 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"I would block her from future sales. She may try this trick again, after a year or two goes by, to get more free stuff. Some people will do anything to get a deal.  I am sorry it happened to you.:("
Etsy,3a89pu,5bi5,2,Thu Jun 18 01:25:47 2015 UTC,"I had someone do the same thing to me on ebay!   First off, they put in a best offer on two of my items. Both were similar but they offered a little less for the second one. ""Ok,"" I think to myself, ""I'll consider this a buy-two discount."" I approve both.  Buyer says they're surprised I accepted so fast and could I please wait a few days for payment as they're getting paid soon. Ok...  Then they say they have an ""issue"" and can only afford one. The cheaper one. Of course.  Then I ship that one and they contact me complaining about my work and how it's basically a pile of steaming dog shit. I was angry, hurt, resentful, and annoyed. I gave them another discount to get them to fuck off, basically, even though I knew I was getting played and didn't deserve it.  Still their accusations ring in my head sometimes. Even though I've gotten a lot more praise for my work than I've ever gotten negatives (his is the only time someone was unhappy with what I sent).  And that's the story of why I don't accept best offers on ebay anymore."
Etsy,3a89pu,phoebeandjuniper,2,Fri Jun 19 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"I had a simliar situation.  The lady ordered a custom order, received it, claimed there was a ""large stain"" on the back of the dress. Well, I take photos of everything before I send them out next to the package to be safe about that stuff. Call me jaded or whatever but I do that as security for both the customer and I.  I sent the photos to the lady to show her that when I mailed it, there was no such stain.  - She refused to send me pictures of the dress or return it, so no-refund issued.  I did not get a neg review as I think she knows I would have fought it through Etsy with my photo evidence. - TL;DR someone tried to pull a fast one on me, claimed there was a stain, there wasn't."

Etsy,3a6hnz,figment81,4,Wed Jun 17 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"This is my wrong address policy:   If the shipping address is different from the address provided through Etsy, please contact us prior to payment. If the wrong shipping address is supplied by the buyer, and the buyer does not notify us before the shipment is dispatched, then the buyer will be responsible for the cost of shipping the item again after it returns back to us.   I never would have driven states away to retrieve a package or shipped it on my own dime unless I was the one that entered it wrong."
Etsy,3a6hnz,sneaky_dragon,3,Wed Jun 17 17:37:36 2015 UTC,oh i totally entered it wrong! well kind of - it was a supplier - who i didn't tell i moved - so they shipped it to my old address (but they didn't tell me when it was shipping - it was a big to-do)
Etsy,3a6hnz,madxstitcher,2,Wed Jun 17 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"It sucks when it happens to you as a buyer, but as a seller, you're not responsible for the buyer not double checking their address. You're only responsible for sending it to the address provided.   If something is returned to you and needs to be reshipped, I'd make them pay the extra shipping. If something goes to the wrong place, well. Not your fault. You sent it where you were told to end it, and you're not psychic and couldn't possibly know you weren't supposed to send it there.   If it's an option, I would offer insurance, though. I automatically include it on every order I ship, and just consider it included in the price of the item. It doesn't cover the buyer sending the parcel to the wrong address, but it does cover pretty much everything else."
Etsy,3a6hnz,locustandplum,2,Wed Jun 17 17:43:26 2015 UTC,It hurts my head to think that a buyer would blame the seller for the buyers error. I don't have a wrong address policy in place but perhaps I should.
Etsy,3a6hnz,locustandplum,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"This is what I've come up with:  Please make sure that the shipping address is correct when you place your order.

If the address is incorrect, the buyer is responsible for additional shipping charges and replacement charges if the item is not recoverable. Thank you!"
Etsy,3a6hnz,hebejebez,2,Wed Jun 17 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"oh i like that a lot! I already have a blurb in many places to please double check your shipping address, and if it is incorrect to please let me know as soon as possible/before it ships.   I think your wording is perfect!!!!!"
Etsy,3a6hnz,locustandplum,2,Wed Jun 17 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"I had a customer provide their old address to me which was in a different state, I still haven't received the package back and the buyer even contacted the old letting agent to get her mail forwarded but the package is still missing.  Who steals yarn though really?! It's freaking yarn! That being said I don't know how long return to sender takes in Australia especially cross States, I have a replacement for the customer but I'm hoping I won't need it, I'll ship it at the end of the month if her last one hasn't turned up. I'm extra bummed about it because she won a competition I did on Instagram and her free prize skein was in that package :("
Etsy,3a6hnz,Christypaints,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:40:43 2015 UTC,Too ironic...I was preparing a shipment for tomorrow and I went to order a shipping label via Etsy. The address supplied isn't confirmed with USPS so I did some sleuthing and I think I know the correct address (dropped a digit perhaps) but sent the customer an email (and convo) to confirm which address is correct. I'm glad this conversation happened today otherwise I probably would have ignored the message that the address was not confirmed. Thanks for that!!
Etsy,3a6act,mewk69,4,Wed Jun 17 15:47:48 2015 UTC,what I've done so far is queue posts in tumblr and used ifttt to auto post that to fb and twitter. you can do the same using your instagram account as a seed.
Etsy,3a6act,sneaky_dragon,3,Wed Jun 17 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Look into IFTTT.com  You can set up custom If This, Then That actions. takes a while to work out magic combos, but when you do it works great.  For example, I have it set up that any picture posted on our company FB page get re-posted on twitter.  I also have it set up that any instagram posts I make on instagram also go to twitter.  I have a third recipie that takes all my twitter picture posts and posts them on Tumblr."

I have mine set up in stages, so I can skip certain networks to keep a variety in content between everything. Some social networks cross post to others, but nothing goes to everything.   I was playing around with it the other week though, and managed to accidentally create a feedback loop, which made a post go out about 20 times before I managed to shut it down.   Don't do that."

It auto tweets, AND will remind you to post to Instagram and allow you to prewrite the post which is great. I also have Crowdfire which has an auto response thing, but I have it set to just be like ""Hey! Thanks for following us!' But some folks I've noticed have it say, like, ""HI COME SEE MY INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK AND LINKDIN"" which I think is awkward and awful."

Etsy,3a4idx,novapine,12,Wed Jun 17 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe I'm an asshole, but I have a pretty long message I send those people.   This is a prewritten message I've copied and pasted for my convenience. If you're receiving this response, that means you didn't read my policies section and told me you had (x) amount of instagram, YouTube, tumblr or blog followers and said you wanted us to ""work"" together (which means you wanted me to spend my time and money to send you things from my site for free). Here are some things I'd like you to consider: 1. How rude would it be to walk into a boutique, go up to the owner and say ""Hey, your store is so cute! I really like that shirt and those necklaces. Give me those for free and I'll take pictures of myself wearing them and post links on my blog so maybe somewhere someone might spend money on things here."" They would probably first of all look at you like you were crazy, then kindly point out that it wasn't free to make those products and it wouldn't make sense to give things away that other people would gladly pay for. 2. It's kind of a slap in the face to store owners when you're basically saying that the things in their store that are their livelihood and creative outlet are worthless to you, so if you like something that someone spent time and money making then you should probably just take your chances and buy it. You're not above everyone else for having followers on whatever blog you're trying to promote. It seems like reviews for things you didn't have to pay for would probably be pretty biased anyway.  3. I don't really need help in the marketing department, YOU found my store so obviously getting traffic isn't a massive issue to me. You may think I'm being unreasonably harsh or rude, but I would never be selfish enough to imply that I deserve hand made products from a stranger for free (especially something that I could probably buy for less than $10). It kind of just makes it look like you don't even have $10 to spend. What a great marketer you must be."
Etsy,3a4idx,GoodVyybes,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:30 2015 UTC,Haha awesome. Have you ever gotten a reply?
Etsy,3a4idx,TheMothFlock,10,Wed Jun 17 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they reply they usually call me rude and say something like ""I've worked with a lot of people and this is so unprofessional"" etc. But I mean, I'm tired of getting treated like my store isn't a real store and my products are free for me to buy. I just think you'd have to have a pretty massive sense of self entitlement to ask strangers for free shit, so I don't really care much about their opinions."
Etsy,3a4idx,GoodVyybes,6,Wed Jun 17 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with you wholeheartedly. I've sent free stuff to promoters before, but only after I made friends with them first on my own accord. Approaching someone for freebies is just rude otherwise imo."

I agree that the photos could be a bit brighter and clear, maybe trying to fit the entire item in the thumbnail if possible? Also with your pricing, you might find more success having whole or half numbers with your pricing - such as $14 or $14.50 instead of $13.99. I know the .99 works in a more commercial setting but a lot of Etsy sellers have found that whole numbers make a different impression for handmade & vintage even if it's just a cent difference.

The problem isn't so much what you want, but your budget. £100 doesn't go a very long way, especially once you factor materials and other costs in. You're looking at less than a day's work, and that's with a reddit discount.  Can you give some more detail on what you'd like? If it's just casting a ring from some old metal, then you might be in luck. If you want detailed jewellery stuff done properly, you might need to rethink how much you want to spend."

Etsy,3a5yj6,mis85,2,Wed Jun 17 14:17:25 2015 UTC,It looks like your tags could use some work. Try not to use one word tags.   Having a banner would be a good addition and maybe some sort of shop announcement.  Some of your pictures are a little dark and you may want to rethink some of the backgrounds.   The only other point would be to stay clear of copyrighted or trademarked material. Anything mentioning any one else's  characters could get you into trouble.
Etsy,3a5yj6,trailscrafts,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"The backgrounds, I'm afraid, hurt my eyes (especially that blue one).  I like your products tho."
Etsy,3a5yj6,5bi5,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome product! I'd say work on your photos. It's the way you get people to actually click on your product and take a look.   You could probably change up your background. For your products, a light box might work out well! This has a tutorial on how to make one yourself: http://www.everythingetsy.com/2013/02/improve-your-product-photography-5-diy-tutorials/  If you don't want to use a light box, try for more plain backgrounds; the ones you have distract from your product as they're super colorful AND textured. Photograph using natural light. Avoid flash.  Another thing I'd say is have more than one photo. Even if you think it's not necessary, it's nice to see more of the product you'll be spending money on. Maybe have the products being used, someone wearing them, etc. This would help give scale too. I'd take down the pictures with the measuring tape; they don't look very appealing. You can put the measurements in the description and just include something cute in the picture that can help give scale but won't be as distracting.   Hope this helps a bit. Good luck!"

Etsy,3a3nvb,ihaveacutepuppy,2,Wed Jun 17 08:51:41 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your sales, but don't lower your prices. Family is great by being supportive, but they also not necessarily your target audience. When people like something few bucks won't deter them from buying it.  However, I was looking at your headbands and I thought I couldn't figure out the time I would want to wear it. I think you should think of what kind of people you want to buy your headbands and then create some pictures with full body shots. For example, you want yoga people to buy your headbands, dress up in yoga clothes, go outside and take some pictures, you want boho people buy your stuff - dress up that style, etc. I believe that could help your sales - I think with fashion accessories people want to see how it will fit with their style.  I hope it makes sense."

Etsy,3a4kj4,midlifecrackers,2,Wed Jun 17 04:27:51 2015 UTC,They launched this today and got to see it. Looks just like kickstarter. I'm interested to see where they go with this and what are the requirements to start one of these.
Etsy,3a4kj4,OceanSiren,2,Wed Jun 17 04:33:49 2015 UTC,"We have a store in the first round and are hoping for good things.  We've never crowd funded before so there has been a steep learning curve preparing.   Etsy has been really cool about creating tutorials and guidelines though. As far as I know, once Fund is out of Beta, handmade sellers will be able to use the platform.  For now, no vintage and no raw supplies, but who knows, that could change in time too."
Etsy,3a4kj4,Musgojefe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:18:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Hope you guys reach your goal! I wonder if they will have pretty strict rules for allowing sellers to start a fund. It's a great opportunity for many sellers and opens up all kinds of doors for creativity, but I can see this platform getting flooded and/or abused easily."
Etsy,3a4kj4,OceanSiren,2,Wed Jun 17 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, fingers crossed.  Not sure what the rules will be, as long as it's a handmade/selfmade product I think they'll be okay with it.  I'm assuming they are looking for ways to make money with their IPO capital, so they will want to attract as many funders as possible once they are out of beta.   I do think the seller ratings being attached to the campaign is pretty great way to instill confidence in potential backers."
Etsy,3a4kj4,Musgojefe,2,Wed Jun 17 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's just another money grab from Etsy.  They need to appear profitable for their investors, and they've had a really rough go of it since their IPO.  If they can get crowdfunding as part of their system and it becomes popular or a success, they will take a cut from each funded listing, and it's pure profit.  To be honest, it seems a little gross."
Etsy,3a4kj4,Thischarmingmancave,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:39:23 2015 UTC,This is very intriguing and can see myself trying to take advantage of it someday. I'm interested in seeing what the success rate will be though.
Etsy,3a4kj4,locustandplum,2,Wed Jun 17 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Us too, Etsy has done almost zero promotion at this point.  It will be interesting to see what happens if Fund gets a little visibility.  So far no front page mention, no newsletter mention and took half the day to get a button to the Fund section from the browse menu.  I'm not complaining at all because it's beta and they are probably working their butts off to make sure the backside is running smooth before they try and drive in traffic."
Etsy,3a4kj4,Musgojefe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:34:07 2015 UTC,i was kind of thinking the same thing this morning (that they are making sure things are running smoothly) But I do hope they promote this a little. (im in the beta too)
Etsy,3a4kj4,figment81,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  if they don't offer some marketing soon outside of the generic press release, I think most the shops are going to have a very uphill battle."
Etsy,3a4kj4,Musgojefe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:07:32 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to your project?
Etsy,3a3eu1,miilkychan,6,Tue Jun 16 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on starting! That really is the hardest point! You'll hear this a lot but you'll probably have more success with simpler photos. I know people get annoyed with everything on a white background, but etsy is paaaacked with items, especially jewelry, so you need to make it as clear as possible what you are selling when someone is scrolling through thousands of search results. The photos are nice and clear so that's great but you'll definitely have a lot of sellers recommending simpler photos.  This is a great time to start up as the summer is really slow for most sellers, so it will give you time to get established before the holidays so you can take advantage of the traffic then. Just try to list as much as you can so you can really utilize the flood of shoppers this fall. Best of luck!"
Etsy,3a3eu1,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Hmmm, okay, that's interesting and good to know. I think I might maybe leave it for a month, then swap to simpler photos and compare my hits or something? I might just swap them out sooner actually, I only did it because I've seen other stores doing the same >.< thanks for the advice :)"
Etsy,3a3eu1,seonadancing1,3,Tue Jun 16 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"I agree about some of the backgrounds being cluttered--especially the shell background makes the pendant a little hard to see. Personally, I also like to see a photo of jewelry on a model or cutout of some sort so I can see how large the necklace is proportionally. One of the biggest disappointments is getting a necklace that is bigger or smaller than my expectations."
Etsy,3a3eu1,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of photographing them next to a ruler, do you think that would that be ok? I don't really want to use a model and I don't have a mannequin or anything like that."
Etsy,3a3eu1,elkjassss,2,Wed Jun 17 07:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think a background like in this listing is acceptable since the pendant is big enough in the picture and the background is still mostly white but something like this listing becomes too much and very ""I don't know what I'm looking at"".   I don't think it's a bad thing to have not purely white backgrounds but just make sure that there aren't too many things going on at the same time."
Etsy,3a3eu1,lydiav59,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you! :) definitely going to be changing these photos a little haha"
Etsy,3a3eu1,Christypaints,2,Wed Jun 17 07:28:15 2015 UTC,"Nice start,I like the stones you use do you cut them yourself?One thing,a bio would be nice,also I didn't see anything about the materials,or techniques you use.Good luck:)"
Etsy,3a3eu1,Christypaints,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Unfortunately not, I current buy the stones at local stores and work the clay myself just with my hands and a sewing needle haha. However I have been looking a dremels today, it would be really awesome if I could start cutting them too.  Ahh I thought I has already added one! I will definitely have a look at that and add something about my process, thank you!"
Etsy,3a3eu1,Christypaints,2,Tue Jun 16 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your store! Your pendants are really pretty.   You should fill out the  shop welcome/description section. It is the section on your front page just under your banner. (I can't for the life of me think of the correct name. I know someone else here can tell you) When I went to your shop, I honestly could not tell what you are selling. I looked for your shop description under the banner to tell me what you are selling, but nothing was there.  I am on a laptop with a small screen. The thumbnails for your front page are hard to figure out . Don't get me wrong, your photos are really nice, but your background is swallowing your beautiful pendants. When I am looking to make a purchase, I want to see what I am getting without a lot of distractions. For instance, you have a pendant with a tiger eye in it. In one of the photos, there is a yellow flower near it. At first glance, I thought the tiger eye was another flower. Your clay work and stones are so beautiful that it is kind of a shame to have them lost in the background.  You may also want to look at other shops that are selling jewelry and read their policies. I feel that you are opening up the door to problems for yourself by saying that if an item arrives broken, send it back and you will refund their money. To save yourself headaches down the road, you need to be more specific. Are you going to refund their shipping costs to get it to them originally, are you going to pay return shipping, are you going to offer insurance?  Pick a few shops that have been open for several years, preferably in your own country. Make sure they have good sales volumes. See what they have in their policies page. One lousy customer can hurt your enthusiasm for your shop. If you are vague with your policies, you may run into someone that will try to take advantage of that.  You might also want to read the Etsy handbook, it is helpful.  I wish you tons of sales, you have a really nice idea. The more items you can put up for sale, the better. Keep working on getting more items listed.  Good luck to you!"
Etsy,3a5uxt,figment81,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"From one shop: ""To shed some light on the background, we just got a few more moms from local community to sew scarves. They were once professional sewers but got laid off due to that the fact that retailers outsourced their work to other countries. BIG thank you for supporting our US made goods and local economies!!""  Thought this was too muricay.

I'm sure most of what you're seeing is that of the above."
Etsy,3a5uxt,PawedUp,2,Thu Jun 18 00:18:46 2015 UTC,"A very large portion of Etsy products are resellers.  It's a market, and if people are willing to pay then there's obviously a demand.  Unless you're producing the same item, I'm confused to why this upsets you. Please don't take my words negatively."
Etsy,3a5uxt,ChrisIsBored,2,Fri Jun 19 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"Ppl are upset because it is against the TOU to resell factory made goods on Etsy; it dilutes the market for compliant shops that are selling actual handmade items.  An even more nasty option is that some factory in China found an original handmade good on Etsy, knocked off the design, sold it to non-compliant Etsy resellers at pennies on the dollar, and put those black-hat Etsy shops in direct competition with the original designer.  That's why people get upset about these sorts of things."
Etsy,3a5uxt,skunkhaus,2,Fri Jun 19 09:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well... When you put it that way. :)  I do see a wide range of items that are available in bulk from places like eBay or Alibaba...  I guess I just assumed this was normal, seeing how I'm still somewhat new on Etsy.  Thanks for clearing that up."
Etsy,3a5uxt,ChrisIsBored,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"Of course it is! Now I have had my own images stolen  by people on alibaba, so I know it does happen. But I'm quick to get them taken down. But I do not think that is what has happened here."
Etsy,3a2fto,Dashelle,5,Tue Jun 16 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"Hello to a fellow Carolinian with Monterey roots--what a coincidence!!   Your pics are awesome!  Photos are a bit of a rara avis on Etsy for a number of reasons, and they play by a different set of rules.  If you want to succeed in photography, you need to do competitive research and see what other successful photography shops are doing.  Looking at non-photo etsy shops won't get you too far.    These are the top shops in photography, according to the latest reading of data.  Take a look at a few dozen of them and see what they're doing and you're not.  http://craftcount.com/category.php?cat=3&subcat=29  The main thing to keep in mind is that you really exist at the nexus between digital and physical media.  It's possible (I have no idea, really) that people seeking photos are looking for printable options.  If you haven't researched this yet, it's worthwhile to either find, or to A/B test that data.  Definitely consider refining your titles and tags -- a lot.  Both are hugely underdeveloped in your case.  You're using nowhere near all 140 characters allowed in your title, and your tags are (sorry to say) quite ineffective.  Look at photoshops that do well and see what they're doing with their titles and tags--there's an art and a science to it.  If you want to do your own thing, do it based on research.  I'm gonna shill a bit for my pal [www.marmalead.com] here.  They do good things for tag and pricing analysis, for free.    Remember also the paradox of choice.  You have a ton of prices and sizes available.  That's not always a good thing.  Sometimes it's a confusing and frustrating thing.  I'm not convinced that local pickup is going to have a huge impact on your business, one way or the other.  Sounds like a pain in the neck, tbph.  Your pictures are really, truly, great, and I think when you get your marketing more effective, people are going to want to buy your product.  How/when you get there is up to you.  Good luck!"
Etsy,3a2fto,skunkhaus,2,Tue Jun 16 19:28:17 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for mentioning www.marmalead.com! It's awesome so far! I'm already fixing up my listings and will hopefully get some more views!
Etsy,3a2fto,i_dont_love,3,Wed Jun 17 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, gotta spread that marmalead love.  That app is the proverbial shizz.  :)"
Etsy,3a2fto,skunkhaus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:56:05 2015 UTC,"Great tips, thank you! I have indeed been following some of the top photography shops and mimicked their shops, many of whom are on that list you sent. I'm not sure what more can be done there.  For the titles, I was concerned that the long titles with random words were unprofessional. Is that really the wrong approach? I'll definitely check out Marmalead.   Also, I was under the impression that if you have expensive items, you also want to have cheaper items for people who want to support you but cannot afford it. Is that not the case?"
Etsy,3a2fto,i_dont_love,3,Tue Jun 16 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely beef up those titles. It's not unprofessional, especially on Etsy where everyone is doing it. Add stuff that makes sense, so for example on your ""Photo Mirror Lake Yosemite multiple sizes picture"" I would instead title it something like: ""Yosemite Mirror Lake Photo; Nature Photography; Yosemite National Park; Photography; Print Photography; Nature Prints; Wall Art;."" As long as it's relevant it doesn't look unprofessional. People only really pay attention to the first few words, the other shit is just so that people can find you when they do a search. You also wan your tiles to correspond with your tags. So all those words in your title should be a tag."
Etsy,3a2fto,skunkhaus,2,Tue Jun 16 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm afraid that the short listing title approach is not getting anywhere.  You want long titles with an abundance of keywords, and those titles should not be bound to what you and I would consider grammatical standards.  Etsy will only display the first 3 or so words, anyways, for listings that appear on searches, so don't worry about looking professional.    Your tags are in need of improvement because it's unlikely that they will deliver you the kind of customers your shop needs.  Tags should be based on search terms, and those search terms need to be long-tail, in order to be competitive.  Finally, yes, you have too many sizes and price points.  It's a problem I've seen frequently among (particularly) photographers who do or contract their own printing rather than selling a digital file. The problem is that you want to pass flexibility and multiple price points onto the consumer, but you're doing it in a way that's unintentionally making it harder for them to order.  You may want to consider digital downloads as an option, as those afford flexibility without the huge range of price points.  As an aside, I'm concerned that you're just putting your pictures out there for all the world to pirate.  It would take me all of 3 seconds to remove your watermark with any graphics editor more advanced than Microsoft Paint, and there are many, many, many people who have lost sales and gotten into copyright battles on account of not protecting their digital images.  I really don't want you to come across one of your photographs on some t shirt or tote bag at a 99 cent store someday.  Unless you were the one who put it there.  That is a little victim blamey on my part (clearly, the pirates are in the moral wrong--not you), but put your stuff out there long enough and you will certainly lose sales if you don't protect it in some way."
Etsy,3a2fto,trailscrafts,3,Tue Jun 16 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"You have beautiful photos! I would agree that your tags and titles need some work. Try not to use one word tags. I would also suggest filling out your policies section. I think it's great that you have different sizes available. Promoting on social media may help as well. I use promoted listings, twitter and I have a blog. All of which I think do help."
Etsy,3a2fto,phoebeandjuniper,2,Tue Jun 16 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"I love that you offer a variety of prices, helps for people just trying out your work. I agree that it would be really easy to download and print at home- if you're not into watermarks(I personally don't like them) then perhaps consider presenting you photos in a different way. I am much more likely to purchase if the artist has their work shown in a frame or on a wall. It helps the buyer visualize your work in their space and leads to those ""oh that would look great above the couch"" thoughts. Plus it makes it harder to steal your work without taking away from the beauty of the piece itself. Definitely more work but a tip I hear a lot for people offering prints and 2-d art."
Etsy,3a2fto,InspecterJones,2,Tue Jun 16 22:57:04 2015 UTC,I'm getting to the point where I think selling photo prints on etsy is just a crapshoot. The big shops at this point just get all the relevant search results because of the attention they already receive. I've only managed to get 4 sales and have probably lost money overall - that isn't to say I've given up but it's just super super hard compared to selling other things.  I've recently started developing a presence on instagram and that's helping to drive traffic but no sales so far from that. I don't know - if you figure it out please let me know the secret as well.
Etsy,3a1voa,babblepedia,6,Tue Jun 16 16:08:39 2015 UTC,"I won't use any fabric that says ""for non-commerical use"" or ""for home/personal us only"" Even if it's not binding, it's not worth the risk. They can still take you to court if they wanted to. Companies that have that written on the selvage, loose my business. I will not purchase from them."

Etsy,3a1voa,courtneyj,3,Tue Jun 16 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"First, this is not a lawyer's website.  Second, there are many ways this is wrong and many ways in which it's misleading.   None of the numerous courts that have considered such labels has found them to prevent transfer of title.   Transfer of title to the property is not the problem- infringement of trademarks and design patents is the problem. Also, anyone who uses ""transfer of title"" in the context of personal property is nuts.   Nor do label notices create an ""implied equitable servitude upon the chattel,"" such restraints on alienation being disfavored at common law.   Yes, you own the bloody fabric in fee simple or whatever. But RESELLING it is an entirely different beast through which you CAN infringe intellectual property rights.   Matrix Essentials v. Quality King Distribs., 522 F. Supp. 2d 470, 478-79 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (finding that the trademark first sale doctrine barred enforcement of ""professional use only"" restriction);   Matrix Essentials dealt with genuine articles being resold without modification. If you turn the fabric into a finished product, it's modified and the trademark owner likely has a right to enforce their Selvage license...  Later on the author gets confused and starts citing copyright cases?  At any rate, if the Selvage licensor has a design patent on the pattern, no amount of citation of case law will save you from patent infringement. Do fashion companies do this? Effing yes they do.  And despite the amount that the author wants it to be so, one case from the District of Puerto Rico does not a precedent make; and the large body of Trademark caselaw elsewhere leaves it an open enough question that a particularly well-lawyered company would take the risk of trying to crush you in court."
Etsy,3a1voa,scottmmjackson,7,Wed Jun 17 03:51:50 2015 UTC,this person is NOT a lawyer. While you may be able to make and sell something with a personal use fabric - you still cant market it by using any trademark words - so i don't know how you would market it.  also do you really want to trust a non lawyer - plus a site where there are cat memorial photos on the homepage http://www.tabberone.com/index.shtml

Etsy,3a12pr,iheartgin,2,Tue Jun 16 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I currently sell in two shops locally and two shops in other states! The shops I've worked with usually do a 60%/40% split (you get 60% they get 40%) but it varies from shop to shop.   I'm unsure of what you sell but I created a full catalog of my products to use for wholesale orders out of state (I don't do consignment out of state). This same concept could be used with consignment, just don't include a wholesale price.   What I've done is just email the shop and say that I've heard about them or been in there and that I think that my products would fit in nicely. I then include the catalog attachment for them to look at.   For locating shops I have used Yelp a lot - just type in ""boutique shopping"" and then you can pick from categories...so for example I usually choose ""home goods"" since I sell home goods. If you're selling clothing then you could pick ""women's clothing"" or something similar. Then I just start researching, looking at their websites, facebook, instagram, etc. I try to get a feel for what aesthetic they have and if I think my products will fit in then I email them. I also have used instagram and facebook as a way to find shops.   If you want to see an example of my catalog I can PM you, just let me know :)"

People may monitor their traffic referrals, see those sites, click through to them, and may click on an advertisement which would equal money for those sites. Or they have some type of CPM/impression ad setup where XXXX number of viewers = $ depending on the ad model.  Usually they're sites just scrapping pictures links, placing your URL as the source link and selling ad space or they have some type of CPC ad model. Which isn't the case for the sites you've listed.

We actually sold Spode Imperial Jewel plates this morning that I'm just in love with, but, alas, on they go to a better life!   I'd say right now I'm most in love with this Harmony House Finlandia serving platter and bowl set. Every time I look at them I think Mod 60's.  That's probably a much longer answer than you wanted, but there it is!    My partner would say the Pfaltzgraff Gourmet Brown we have listed, or the Aurora Black dishes.

Etsy,3a02n1,cherryfristado,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:28:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of your items, and assuming you're in the US, you might consider using flat rate boxes. When I had my shipping like that, I set up profiles for each type of box, (small, medium, large, envelope, padded envelope) and used the profile that fit my item size. The plus is that ""if it fits it ships"" for one price, as long as its under 70lbs. Also, the boxes themselves are free, just order them from the USPS.  However, if you're selling small items, $5.25 for shipping is a lot to buy a $5 item. That was my problem. Almost everything I sell is small and weighed only a few ounces, so I used the shipping costs calculator on the USPS site to see how much it would cost to send something weighing 10 ounces from where I live in Maryland over to Cali. (Theoretically the farthest away from me) and used that amount -$3- as a flat shipping fee profile for multiple items, since it still comes in under 10 ounces. If something is going to be much heavier than that, then I use a flat rate box shipping profile."
Etsy,3a02n1,cherryfristado,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i'm shipping rings! Still trying to figure all of this out, i'm not even sure if i'm under pricing myself!

I've only had my shop for two days, and only been making the rings for two weeks, so i'm really overwhelmed right now!"

Etsy,39yro1,skunkhaus,3,Mon Jun 15 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"The more mainstream it gets, the more competition will arise.  It could spike due to new sellers. New sellers might just hear about it and go, ""oh damn I can make money doing this"" or ""look at this shop and those sales, I can replicate this"". I'm sure a lot have never heard of ETSY before the IPO. News agencies will do articles on sellers revs/profit and some might see it as a good revenue stream and take a bite.  For a lot of sellers I'm sure they're not making near enough to make ends meet. I think a large % that get into the game will opt out after a while.  You could also say that it becoming more mainstream may also bring in more potential customers and equal more sales an established shop may get. I'm going with that not being the case though. I think a lot of new shops will die off and the established sellers will reign over time. You might get some new shops taking an established shops niche out from under their feet.  Would be curious to see graphs/trends after the dust settles. Amazon will launch their own thing, which some may ditch ETSY or try to piggyback off both if they can output the volume of sales."
Etsy,39yro1,PawedUp,2,Mon Jun 15 22:16:16 2015 UTC,"That makes sense but I'm sure the news about Etsy attracted lots of new buyers too! Wonder if the increased traffic of buyers balances out the influx of new shops...  Personally, Apr, May, and Jun have been better than ever for me! But I'm still a new, growing shop and I'm constantly improving my SEO, so my metrics may not be reflective of a trend for established sellers."

Etsy,39yro1,Sniper1154,2,Tue Jun 16 18:27:37 2015 UTC,I noticed a definite drag at the outset of Spring.  Typically I get a rush of wedding orders and that was surprisingly absent this year.  These past few weeks have been busier than last year with Father's Day though.   I also can't really blame anyone but myself.  I don't typically self-promote and I've always considered Etsy just fun-money to re-invest into my woodworking hobby.  In that regard things are still going smoothly.
Etsy,39wtfw,locustandplum,11,Mon Jun 15 13:16:50 2015 UTC,As a buyer I think it's spammy when sellers do that.
Etsy,39wtfw,hawleywood,2,Mon Jun 15 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"Genuinely curious, but why?  If somebody asked me how I liked their product, I would be thrilled to let them know. Even if it were a horrible product. That's how people improve and hone their skills."
Etsy,39wtfw,DevilishDreamer,9,Mon Jun 15 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"I almost always leave feedback, because I know how important it is for sellers, but it annoys me when they send a separate message asking for feedback. In that case, I likely won't leave feedback because I feel like it's spammy, just like sellers who convo me to let me know about a sale going on in their shop ."
Etsy,39wtfw,hawleywood,3,Mon Jun 15 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on the context of the shop. If it's a relatively new shop/one that's only had a few sales, I wouldn't see it as pushy, but genuine."
Etsy,39wtfw,DevilishDreamer,4,Mon Jun 15 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"Etsy already sends buyers an invite to leave feedback. If the buyer doesn't leave feed back and I follow up, I feel like it's a bit of overkill."
Etsy,39wtfw,k80k80k80,3,Mon Jun 15 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"I could understand that. I hardly keep up with the email that's attached to my etsy, so I hardly get those reminders. I think, in the case of a new shop, it would be totally acceptable to write and say ""Thank you for your order, you're one of my firsts! I'd really appreciate if you might be able to provide some feedback on your experience shopping with us.""."
Etsy,39wtfw,DevilishDreamer,7,Mon Jun 15 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"No feedback is good feedback, do not message the buyers. They get reminded from etsy to leave feedback. I have about 6% leave feedback on my etsy store. Don't expect a lot"
Etsy,39wtfw,Missy1726,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:30:14 2015 UTC,That is a great point. I'd expect if there was an issue they leave negative feedback. I know I would.   I'm just striving to have products that work well for people!
Etsy,39wtfw,trailscrafts,6,Mon Jun 15 14:44:03 2015 UTC,I would not email them and ask for feedback. A lot of buyers do not leave reviews or message feedback for items they have purchased. I personally don't like it when sellers email me asking for feedback.
Etsy,39wtfw,k80k80k80,7,Mon Jun 15 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I don't do that. I feel it bothers the buyer and invites criticism. Feels a little tacky, too."
Etsy,39wtfw,bababby,5,Mon Jun 15 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I would love if a shop emailed me to ask what I thought of he product because I was one of the first people to buy it. I would be annoyed if they asked for a review in that email. But I would be very happy to give you feedback -- and usually I would end up leaving a review anyway, since I'd have to message you back through the app or etsy.com"
Etsy,39wtfw,bubuloobu,3,Mon Jun 15 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't ask them for a review and I wouldn't say I was looking for feedback, but I would convo them and say something like you just wanted to follow up with them to make sure installation went ok and that they're happy with their purchase. I've done this for some of my customers and they've either ignored my message altogether or thanked me for caring enough to ask."
Etsy,39wtfw,la_mayo,3,Mon Jun 15 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"I don't messages buyers asking for reviews unless they message me telling me that they loved my product. What I usually do is send them a cue card with a message on the lines of, ""If you're happy with your item, please consider coming back to leave a review"".  Then again... So far, I've only have 3 reviews. 1 of which is my mom. :p"
Etsy,39wtfw,courtneyj,4,Mon Jun 15 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do this. And I don't really recommend this at all, but if your worry gets the best of you over this there is one thing I do every once in awhile, maybe once a year if that.   If I've had a buyer that has communicated with me via convo and was friendly, talkative and excited in the convos, then I'll track their shipment and send them a convo the day it delivers with a heads up it should be in their mailbox, that it's been wonderful doing business with them, and any other tidbits like designing an item and how I hope they like it, that they were the first buyer of one style of thing, or to let me know what they think of it since it's such a new item for me.  You can't do this with people you never exchanged convos with...and you can't do it with 95% of the people you do exchange convos with...but there are occasionally convos you get where you know that person would have totally been one of your friends if you grew up together and that they will be pulling for you instead of seeing you as weak if you get a little vulnerable and let them know your product is new and you like it but you're unsure if others will.   This is easy for me to do because I sell wedding and baby party favors and those are big events in people's lives that they love to share, and keep sharing long after the transaction is over, so it's easy to be friendly and ask for pictures of the event and build a longer lasting relationship. But this is the only circumstance in which I'd consider contacting for feedback on a specific product."
Etsy,39wtfw,madxstitcher,3,Mon Jun 15 17:11:07 2015 UTC,I get annoyed when Amazon does this. I wouldn't want Etsy sellers doing it as well.
Etsy,39wtfw,RareBeautyEtsy,2,Mon Jun 15 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"I send a hand-written note with each item I sell. Sometimes I mention feedback, sometimes not. My message that goes to the buyer mentions the importance of feedback.   I never message after that, and would consider it spam if a seller asked me for feedback. I have messaged a buyer when an item took a long time in transit, just to let them know it was delivered.  I also dislike the random messages that I receive when I fave an item or a shop. I have six shops, just on Etsy,, and it gets to be overwhelming. I un-fav and don't buy from shops that spam me.   Social media is enough intrusion into people's lives. I don't want to be a pain."
Etsy,39wtfw,phoebeandjuniper,2,Tue Jun 16 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% positive if this is true or a common myth but I often hear that etsy considers it spam so it's against their terms of use. I've heard of people getting warnings from contacting buyers after a sale has finished unless it's to resolve an issue. a lot of people will add a note to the receipt in the package mentioning reviews (mine says ""I'd love to hear your thoughts on etsy!"" So it doesn't sound review-grubbing) but they frown on asking for five star reviews or offering incentives for positive reviews. A shop I bought from once offerred free shipping on a future purchase if you left five stars. I ended up not leaving a review at all because it left a bad taste in my mouth, when I otherwise would have reviewed as I know how important feedback is. I know that's not what you had in mind but just a heads up! The first reviews seem the hardest to get but I promise they will come! Of 4000 sales I've only gotten 750 reviews so don't worry too much, it doesn't mean they don't love your work!"
Etsy,39wtfw,dewprisms,3,Tue Jun 16 23:03:59 2015 UTC,Just keep it as an open request and try to be soft with your wording and it should be okay. Remember that Etsy sends notifications to buyers reminding them to leave reviews.
Etsy,39wtfw,DevilishDreamer,3,Mon Jun 15 13:27:30 2015 UTC,"As a buyer, I would not have any problem giving you feedback if you asked for it. I am lazy though, and probably wouldn't review you on your site, but just in response to your inquiry in personal message."
Etsy,39wtfw,ChrisIsBored,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"I leave a sticker note on the itemized bill I send along with the product. The sticker stands out, versus it simply being another line of text on the paper.  In addition to that, it also says if you leave a review I'll send you a code for free shipping on your next order.  My shop has only been open for nearly 2 months but after 37 order I have 8 reviews."
Etsy,39uoyy,katto,11,Sun Jun 14 23:03:30 2015 UTC,Buyer here. I always pay at the time of purchase and I think that is a strange question for a buyer to ask.
Etsy,39uoyy,shillyshally,3,Sun Jun 14 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. The weird thing is that this is a new shop that I set up a few days ago. This buyer did a transaction and convo me to cancel it. I thought that was weird, so I cancelled it. An hour later, he bought another piece and wanted to pay with bitcoin. No problem, I sent him the address, then he asks how long he has to pay!!"
Etsy,39uoyy,shillyshally,8,Sun Jun 14 23:09:55 2015 UTC,Warning flags.
Etsy,39uoyy,shillyshally,3,Sun Jun 14 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Right? But then again, if he ends up paying, it's ok because it cannot be reversed if he pays with bitcoin. This is just weird. I had another shop for a few years now and this never happened."
Etsy,39uoyy,dewprisms,3,Mon Jun 15 00:43:12 2015 UTC,Your decision. Perhaps follow your gut which seems to be telling you something or you would not have posted the question.
Etsy,39uoyy,tom8o,4,Mon Jun 15 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"Same here. The only time I would ask for a delay is on a custom order that I would not need immediately (in which case I would just get the ball rolling on contact but not request any work to be done until closer to the date), or if I saw an item in their shop was unable to buy immediately, I would inquire about getting another one of that item made when I could pay if the current one was no longer available."
Etsy,39uoyy,novapine,5,Sun Jun 14 23:48:22 2015 UTC,"If possible, I always confit the seller settings to always require immediate payment.  This is across all marketplaces."
Etsy,39uoyy,Jinmin443,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:54:39 2015 UTC,"Ok. So, I think after this 48h passes, I probably should just change my policy and remove that 48h thing.

Etsy,39uoyy,CtFTamp1V03WosAE,3,Mon Jun 15 03:07:52 2015 UTC,I've always had buyer pay immediately. I give a 12 hour slide to payment and explain there order will be cancelled if not paid unless they message me to discuss a valid reason.

Etsy,39sui8,tiopepe_,8,Sun Jun 14 12:55:00 2015 UTC,My honest opinion is that although I like these I wouldn't be willing to pay anywhere near that price for them. I like your close ups but I find the chalk a bit difficult to read. I'd recommend liquid chalk pens instead for a clearer marker-like look. Best of luck!
Etsy,39sui8,-Khaleesi,2,Mon Jun 15 01:04:48 2015 UTC,"They're that price because the stone beads are very fine and weren't cheap, plus I only have a limited stock of those vintage silver beads that were given to me as a present, which will be difficult to find more of. That, plus the Etsy fees and my time spent making them, I wouldn't sell them for any less. But thank you for letting me know."
Etsy,39sui8,poxteeth,8,Mon Jun 15 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think you should consider using different earwires in order to sell your items for the price you want. Not to be rude, but honestly, the ones you have on the three stone earrings look cheap (even if they weren't, they're the same style as the cheapest ones available) and detract from your items. I noticed them right away, other people might also. If you bought some nice silver earwires ($1~2 each), you could raise your prices by a few dollars a pair and have a better chance of selling. Nice earwires are a major selling point for many buyers (myself included), they will match the aesthetic of your beads, and they will make your items look more unique and valuable."
Etsy,39sui8,fuckinintents,6,Tue Jun 16 00:45:42 2015 UTC,Have you thought about liquid chalk pens? It's how baristas get those fine lines in their designs. I think the chalk board is a super cute idea!
Etsy,39sui8,OceanSiren,2,Sun Jun 14 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea! That was one of the things I was having the most doubts about but I really liked the idea, thank you for the solution. :)"
Etsy,39sui8,skunkhaus,4,Mon Jun 15 14:36:29 2015 UTC,Looks like a good start :) You might want to refrain from stating any claims though because it might be against Etsy's rules. This post is a discussion about it
Etsy,39sui8,Missy1726,3,Sun Jun 14 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"I think just a little refinement of language is all that's in order.    ""Coral symbolises life and blood force energy"" is essentially the same thing as saying ""Red roses are a symbol of love,"" or ""Ford mustang is a symbol of American engineering"" So that part's ok, since it makes no claims at all.  The rest of the statement is also not too bad, but could be made more compliant if it were prefaced with the word ""traditionally"", as in    Dark red coral is traditionally used for heating and stimulating the bloodstream and restores harmony to the heart.  It has been used as an aid to depression, lethargy or deficient nutrition.     The idea is to educate the buyer about how coral may have been used in other cultures or by other people, without suggesting that any of those claims have been proven by evidence, or intimating that such benefits will be transferred to the buyer.    There's a big difference between saying the factually provable statement ""traditionally, four-leaf clovers have been believed to bring the bearer luck"", and the factually unprovable statement ""if you wear this four-leaf clover talisman, you will be lucky!!""    edit: formatting"

Add more things Add more ""two word"" tags Realize you won't be successful overnight    I sell expensive jewelry and I would not list those for more than $10 because that's what the market pulls for them.

Etsy,39sui8,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying about the chalk, it looks quite scruffy at the moment, but I bought a chalk pen to tidy it up and I think it adds a personal touch so, thank you, but no I'm not getting rid of it for now.  What /u/poxteeth said about the findings is a good point, I'll think I'll change them, but other than that I won't sell them any cheaper because what I already said above.  I know I won't be successful overnight, that's why I made this post, to get peoples opinion to make it better.   Thank you for your advice."

Etsy,39p1jx,MCetcher,3,Sat Jun 13 14:10:01 2015 UTC,If I delve into a new fandom and become obsessed I tend to spit out a lot of new designs based around that.
Etsy,39p1jx,fairyrebel,2,Mon Jun 15 02:55:50 2015 UTC,I work primarily with reclaimed things - people love to give me broken jewelry now - so I'll just sift through my container of reclaimed charms and beads and choose something at random and then make it into something new.  Either that or I'll send out a request on social media asking people to choose a color and then go with whatever they choose in order until the answers stop coming in.  Randomness is my inspiration 98% of the time.

You could list your regular without tracking option first, then add on first class mail w/tracking as the name or something in the upgrade.   Just so you know, tracking protects you against cases so it may or may not be worth it to ship everything with tracking."
Etsy,39olwz,OceanSiren,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:03:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help! And yes, I know that tracking is a safer way to go but that way the shipping price is almost as much as the product.

Etsy,39m4bn,SassyBlissBoutique,6,Fri Jun 12 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's still spam. Don't email or auto-subscribe previous customers.  Just include the link to your newsletter in your shop and future purchase receipts."
Etsy,39m4bn,sneaky_dragon,0,Fri Jun 12 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's not spam, but it might be against Etsy's terms. CAN-SPAM says you can email a customer since you have established a relationship."
Etsy,39m4bn,jeffclark,2,Fri Jun 12 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"They need to opt in to an email list, and purchasing an item from you is not an agreement to do that.  You could, one time only, email your past customers with a link to where they can sign up for your email list, but even that will likely annoy many people. It CAN NOT be straight up from the mailing list, it has to be done outside of the newsletter so they can choose if they want to opt in to receiving your email.  Your best thing is to start your list and include a link to where you can sign up in your shop announcement and in the email that goes out when an item has been ordered.  Also since I see the question a lot, in the US to operate a mailing list you must also provide an address where a person can snail mail you and it must be in every email you send out, this is why it's a required thing for mailchimp accts, etc.   I see a lot of list building threads and advice in /r/entrepreneur so you might go over there and search around some."
Etsy,39m4bn,courtneyj,2,Fri Jun 12 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, lemme weigh in on this :)  First of all, wonderful idea.  Any real, full-time business should have a newsletter.  Anyone who aspires to go full-time should have a newsletter!  Problem is, Etsy's terms of service and corporate culture discourages you from emailing prior customers with new offer.  This, in fact, goes in accordance with the most recent 'best practices' for commercial emails.  You shouldn't sign up anyone for anything they didn't explicitly ask for.  This is why many folks want to have their own website that runs parallel to Etsy.  A website that allows for newsletter signups (voluntary, of course).    Full disclosure:  I'm launching an app in 10 days that does this automatically www.beeswaxwebsites.com.  Regardless of whether you use my app or someone else's, though, the key to suceess is an ancillary website off of the etsy platform that allows you to send emails to willing customers, while remaining on the Etsy platform for purchases and inventory control."

Etsy,39ifop,I_I_I_I_,7,Fri Jun 12 00:15:01 2015 UTC,SERIOUSLY. I guess 'handcrafting' sort of counts if you're only paying $0.20/hr. But my USA-made dresses? BANNED.
Etsy,39ifop,HildasAttic,5,Fri Jun 12 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is that they saw the messages (if it was in Etsy message) and decided that was against the rules, or that they saw you moved to outside messaging and considered the transaction ""drawing away from Etsy"" which is somewhere in the TOS as no bueno. I think it is something like ""Thou shalt not divert customers from Etsy to your other selling platform"" or the like."
Etsy,39ifop,IAMA_TYPEWRITER,3,Fri Jun 12 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"I guess? It's still a stretch. The transaction was still 100% Etsy beneficial. Sure I didn't SELL the item for $650, but the $50 transaction went through Etsy and they got their fees etc. for months before that.  I'm pretty sure my customer is still going to buy from Etsy, and until today, I haven't needed to get another selling platform.  Unless Etsy considers my craft-fair sales somehow problematic. I'm not sure why they would."
Etsy,39ifop,briekachu,4,Fri Jun 12 01:07:20 2015 UTC,I think that they might have found it too suspicious that you dropped the price 600$. It is indeed against policy to make sales through any other means than Etsy (which is obvious because that's their source of income).
Etsy,39ifop,FormSpaced,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"The entire transaction went through Etsy, including the customer's initiating messege in which she asked to rent it for a day. I made a custom listing for the customer to use to complete the transaction, so Etsy 100% got their fees.  The item itself was NEVER listed as a 'rental', ever. The only way Etsy would have known about the rental situation was through reviewing the customer's allegedly private messages to me."
Etsy,39ifop,CutBranch,3,Sat Jun 13 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"My take on this is that they read your messages and took them as you trying to use Etsy to get in person business, or something that Etsy doesn't get paid for, and they decided they didn't like that. :x"
Etsy,39ifop,briekachu,5,Fri Jun 12 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"But the app allows you to do transactions ""in person"" so I'm not sure how that would've been wrong either. Odd."
Etsy,39ifop,CutBranch,6,Fri Jun 12 01:36:14 2015 UTC,"From the Etsy perspective the seller had a $650 item that was discounted to $50 paid through Etsy, then the item transaction was done in person where they assume the seller pocketed the rest as cash."
Etsy,39ifop,courtneyj,0,Fri Jun 12 02:12:11 2015 UTC,"Just a thought on re-reading your comment... What of the other items where sellers have deeply discounted or simply changed their pricing drastically?   What about the people who post ""$29.00 [item]"" for cheap clicks, but in the description of their listing have a long laundry list of extra charges that go with each dress, bringing the totals to much more than that.  Is Etsy banning those people? How much privacy do Etsy sellers/customers have when messeging one another? Honestly, I should by default assume zero whatsoever, but intrusion on otherwise private communications was not exactly a concern at all until now.  So many questions."
Etsy,39ifop,Christypaints,3,Fri Jun 12 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"There's a difference in my mind - between meeting someone in person and using the Etsy app to provide a transaction, versus using Etsy and meeting them in person. Etsy doesn't know what happens in person after that point - all they have is messages implying that the platform is being used to direct them to another place - which IS against the rules.   I'm not saying it's right or wrong - but that's my opinion on why they would have banhammer'd from the information given."
Etsy,39ifop,CutBranch,0,Fri Jun 12 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"THIS!! This was the subject of one of my emails. I'm at a loss as to why Etsy has this feature... Etsy even HOSTS craft-fair type events, which I have attended, and witnessed other Etsy sellers ""bundle"" a few items together to sell to another live human being, without being banned. Unless these rogue humans were later banned after the event..."
Etsy,39ifop,CutBranch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:47:44 2015 UTC,"and... BTW, Etsy totes got paid. Paid in listing fees for months, SEO fees, ad fees, and for this particular transaction as well. $0 was exchanged in cash."
Etsy,39ifop,araradia,6,Fri Jun 12 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"There still is the matter of you providing what essentially is a service (the rental) when Etsy guidelines specifically prohibit services, with only a few exceptions."
Etsy,39ifop,araradia,7,Fri Jun 12 08:56:58 2015 UTC,"Renting items is a service and services are not allowed by Etsy. It is strictly for the buying/selling of new, tangible, physical items.  Renting a dress does not create a new item for the customer.  https://www.etsy.com/help/article/4524  And unfortunately the onus is on you to read and correctly interpret the rules instead of Etsy having to explain them which is why you'll likely not get a response from them."

If you look at your shop as a whole that is the one I would never click on - the picture isn't doing it justice. I can only imagine in a big search page that it would be the same way. I look forward to seeing the new photos for that listing. I like the box-based photos you use on your earrings.   For tags I think you could expand into a lot of Japanese related keywords.

I'm hoping to draw in customers looking for regular ole necklaces and seeing my listing and being curious enough to like, but that's just a thought. Do you think Japanese word tags will help bring in an american audience?   The origami beads are waterproof! I'll include that information :) thank you so much!"

May I ask why you aren't shipping internationally? I make a good deal of profit from my international sales - and they pay for the shipping - so I'm curious on why you'd cut yourself off from that."
Etsy,39jtvd,briekachu,-1,Fri Jun 12 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"I never said no one knows what origami ism I just said most people don't. In my experience, when I tell people I do origami they've never heard of it. I also feel Japanese words would attract international shoppers. I've never shipped out of the US. Never needed to fill customs and it's extremely expensive to do so from here. I just figured bo one would want to pay 15+ to get the items shipped. I know I wouldn't. Abd it's not that I'm against shipping internationally. I have it listed in my policies that if someone wants something shipped to their country, they can just message me abd I'll adjust the shipping price for their country."
Etsy,39jtvd,littletinypiranha,2,Fri Jun 12 21:57:53 2015 UTC,I see I see. I didn't mean to put actual Japanese phrases or anything. Whatever works for your shop though. :P When you ship with Etsy you print the label (the same size as a regular Etsy shipping label) and just sign and date it really quick. I don't know how much your items weigh but mine are light and cost about $9 to ship internationally from San Francisco area. I imagine that's how much the earrings would cost to ship.
Etsy,39jtvd,Christypaints,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"You should also include some close up pics of the origami part because from the larger picture, it's kind of hard to make out any of the more intricate details that would make it unique from, say, a regular glass bead.

Etsy,39gkgw,courtneyj,6,Tue Jun 16 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"If you were able to make a determination that the 4 stars were full of shit and actually 5, then I think the review system actually worked.  If they had gotten a 1 or 2 star review the seller could have also left a response to the review for you to read and consider as well."
Etsy,39gkgw,Wolfie305,3,Thu Jun 11 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"Some people give four stars even after saying they were completely satisfied and everything was perfect - just the way it is I guess. I would hope my customers looking at my reviews would read what people had to say vs just looking at the number of stars.  The worst reviews are definitely the ones people leave because they didn't read the fucking detailed descriptions I spend hours writing. During the holidays, I sell handmade ornaments and I had one woman get mad in a review because she thought the design was 3D (that I could magically fit inside the tiny opening of the ornament). Everything you need to know about the materials and item is listed in my descriptions. READ PEOPLE."
Etsy,39gkgw,baldylox,6,Thu Jun 11 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see those reviews almost every day:  The seller was extremely helpful, and really went the extra mile for me. They even included a free gift and hand-written thank you card in their beautiful packaging. My item arrived much faster than I thought it would! I'll surely be buying a lot from this wonderful seller in the future! - 4 stars  The only ones that hurt you as a seller are bad reviews, of which I've received one, and that was from a buyer that was obviously trying to scam me - to the point that PayPal sided with ME. PayPal NEVER sides with the seller.   So hundreds or a thousand or so reviews still averages me out to a 5-star rating. I can live with that."
Etsy,39gkgw,withahammer,4,Thu Jun 11 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"If the review is on something beyond the control of the seller (like a shipping issue caused by the carrier) Etsy will remove the review if asked. Not every seller seems to be aware of this.  I had one four-star removed because the guy complained that the prices were shown in US dollars, but had to be converted to CAD. So you actually saved money since our dollar sucks, and you're bitching about it? Boo hoo."
Etsy,39gkgw,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Thu Jun 11 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between rating systems on other platforms, and the thoughts one has when looking at the star system on etsy. I think a 4.5 star review looks bad initially to me, even though I know most of the time that having a 4.5/5 is still excellent!  Having an almost strict visual basis for the experience people have had with a seller, makes for a more guttural reaction. I, being nosy and picky as a buyer, want to know where the bad review(s) are. I often look for them even before I decide to purchase, just because I want to know if it's a real reason to have a less than 5 star review. I know I can't be the only one.   I wish there was a better way, I really do. But any ideas I come up with, always end up with a more negative outcome than the system we have currently. :/"
Etsy,39gkgw,kinyutaka,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"Why would you call a 4.5 star review ""bad""?  It means that either they had one major problem but a ton of great reviews, or they might have had a few minor snags but were still highly recommended. Some people give 4s, simple because ""no one is perfect."""
Etsy,39gkgw,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was bad.   I think a 4.5 star review looks bad initially to me, even though I know most of the time that having a 4.5/5 is still excellent!   It's just a visual thing. Clearly I do know how percentages work (4.5/5 is a 90% - absolutely wonderful!)  And I still said 'most of the time' because I have seen some sellers with a 4.5 rating who had 1-2 1 star ratings about buyers not receiving their item, without any response from the seller. Most of the time, however, it is like you said. It's usually just someone giving a 4/5 because it's still a good indication of a good experience."
Etsy,39gkgw,kinyutaka,2,Thu Jun 11 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"Any multi-seller store will have a review system in place. It's practically required.  Yes, it can be unfair to get a 3-star rating because the UPS guy tossed your hand-made vase out the moving van onto concrete, but that's something that you have to deal with.  If you are a good seller, those low scores will be drowned out by the higher ones.  If a seller has a history of problems, even if they are not his fault, then they shouldn't be handed a 5 star rating."
Etsy,39gkgw,k80k80k80,2,Thu Jun 11 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"People aren't going to pass over your shop because of a couple of 4 star reviews. 2 stars, maybe, but not 4."
Etsy,39gkgw,skunkhaus,2,Thu Jun 11 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here: I use a ton of Yelp and Amazon, and I feel like Etsy's rating system is hopelessly inflated.  The community-wide expectation for all 5 star ratings all the time has left Etsy with a broken system that doesn't describe actual experiences. On Etsy, I would never dream of giving someone less than 5 stars for a transaction that was ""OK"".  And I would think twice about ordering from a seller who had less than, say a solid 4.5 average on Etsy.  Based on Etsy's culture, what's happened is that a potentially descriptive and useful 5 star rating system has been turned into a flat binary rubric where anything (at least) OK gets 5 stars and anything less than OK gets less than 5 stars.  It might as well be 1's and 0's, thumbs up and thumbs down.  Even ole Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had a more sophisticated rating system.  There were two of them, so there were a total of 3 possible outcomes (two thumbs up, one thumb up, two thumbs down).  With Etsy, again, there's just two possible ratings: ""OK"" (5 stars), and ""Terrible""  (Anything less).  If I were to revamp Etsy's rating system (which is overdue for a revision), I'd say maybe a nice, 3-point rating system would solve a lot of problems:    1 point= ""meh""   2 points = ""A-OK""  3 points = ""mind officially blown!!!!""  Ideally, most transactions would fall into the 2-points range (I got what I ordered and it arrived on time).  The 1-point reviews would be for rare unsatisfactory transactions (The seller sent the wrong earrings, and then cursed at me when I complained).  The 3-points rating would be for truly amazing and memorable experiences (I thought I was ordering polymer clay earrings in the shape of unicorns, but the earrings turned out to be made from actual tiny unicorns.  I think they're super-duper enchanted because my acne disappeared and my honey proposed!!)    That's how I'd do it if I ran Etsy."
Etsy,39gkgw,shillyshally,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"Smart shoppers read the reviews, do not just go by the stars. I also read the reviews on Angie's.  In the instances you cite, I would say the reviewer was unfair to ding the seller for a post office glitch. However, I would say the review was warranted in the second case if the seller was not clear about sizing.  Etsy could easily adopt a categorized review system - quality, packaging, shipping, and customer service followed by the comments box."
Etsy,39gkgw,madxstitcher,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"I like the star system in general, but I hate how Etsy arranges theirs.  I'd much rather reviews for individual listings be shown on those listings only, with ALL of them viewable on the shop's homepage.  This is how I got screwed on a recent purchase, because I didn't want to wade through 300+ reviews to find the relevant one to my listing.  If I had, I'd have probably known before buying that the seller had listed something as a genuine product, when it was, in fact, a knock-off brand."

It isn't an enforceable policy.  Buyers give us money in exchange for merchandise. They are responsible for giving us the correct shipping info and being available to receive their packages. We are responsible for getting the items to their doorstep in as advertised condition. It may be in the carrier's hand when it gets lost or damaged, but responsibility falls on you until it reaches the customer.

Etsy,39ept6,jitheshgopan,2,Thu Jun 11 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"I use window light. I had a lighting setup for a while and hated lugging the thing out ( this was when we were living in a place that the sun came in early in the morning and not in the afternoon) so I sold it, and bought myself a good flash to use when I need it.  It really helps to have a manual camera ( I have a dslr)  and a good tripod. You can open your shutter speed to let in more light on days when it's not so bright."
Etsy,39ept6,figment81,2,Thu Jun 11 11:12:31 2015 UTC,"My apartment doesn't get a lot of sun and the windows that do get it aren't in a place where I can use the light.  My system was something I acquired over time, but it ended up being really inexpensive. The lights I use are clip on desk lamps like this one and were about 10 dollars each. I bought four for a show I was doing that was in a dark bar. In my current setup, I only use two, with regular light bulbs. Once these light bulbs burn out I'll probably look into replacing them with something better for photography.   My boyfriend was lovely and tried making me a light box, but the box he used wasn't sturdy enough so it didn't really work. Eventually I got this lightbox for 35. which isn't amazing but it does its job. I also have a white desk so I don't use the cloth that came with it. I never tried the lights or the camera stand that came with it. It's also great because it folds up to be flat for storage.  I've been looking for a basic tripod for awhile so I was very happy when I found this for 23 dollars. It is great for what I need and I think I could even take it outside to do some pictures with it.  Part of the reason I needed a tripod so bad is I was incredibly lucky in getting my DSLR. It an early Canon Rebel model and I got it for 85 bucks on craigslist. It works great but if I shoot without the tripod a lot of the shots are too blurry to use.   I also use Photoshop elements. Before I used it a lot to get a good white balance and remove the yellowish color cast. Now it's mostly for increasing the brightness. Using the aperture and shutter speed also helps a lot with that.   My biggest pieces are 5x7, with most of them being 3x3 so I have a tiny easel that I got for 6.13 that works for both sizes. I have found putting a blank white card behind the 3x3 works is helpful, since the paper I use is fiber paper and lets a lot of light through.  This process is so much quicker for me and the results are more predictable. This last round of photos I managed to get close up detailed shots as well."
Etsy,39ept6,jmk816,2,Thu Jun 11 12:58:37 2015 UTC,I use both natural light and studio lights. A cheaper way to get that outdoor feel inside however is just to put daylight bulbs in some desk lamps you can get great results with that if you are on a budget :)

I'm sure it depends on your items a bit, but in my opinion it goes like this: cheap artificial setup < natural daylight < expensive artificial setup.    The advantages of artificial are control, speed, and consistency.  But you have to really know what you're doing.  For 99% of vendors I'd say natural daylight is the way to go.

Etsy,39c5bx,skunkhaus,8,Wed Jun 10 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"This might sound silly, but I can never figure out what to say on Twitter. Instagram is easy because sharing a photo usually speaks for itself, but with Twitter I always feel like I'm trying to start a conversation with thin air (and I'm socially awkward enough in real life as it is.) I would love to use Twitter if it felt less like I was just talking to myself."
Etsy,39c5bx,dearwilde,4,Wed Jun 10 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Hey there @dearwilde... If you use the appropriate hashtags on Twitter then the people who are searching for people talking about what you're talking about will find you when they search for those hashtags and then engage with you.  So if you make crocheted accessories and use the hashtag ""crochet"" and a pic of something cool you made along with a relevant statement (not just ""buy this now"") then someone who looks for #crochet might find your tweet and if they like what you made and what you said, they may respond with a tweet back to you... Then you respond... etc.  It might take some getting used to but it's doable and very easy once you get the hang of it. Though it might be a tad bit awkward in the beginning ;)"

I like the idea of it, and if I had an account where I felt engaged with the craft community I know I would love using it, but getting started feels very overwhelming at times! Twitter is something I'm planning to seriously look into though, as far as social media goes."
Etsy,39c5bx,madxstitcher,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"The very first thing I did to get good at Twitter-for-business was follow everyone I could find who was providing quality content.  I got up to about 1000 accounts I was following closely every day (I later cut it down to my favorite 300-or-so).  Many of these accounts also found my content interesting and followed me back (thanks).  Some of the others were great for retweets.  The others were great for entertainment.  The next amazing thing I did for twitter was get tweetdeck.  You don't need to manage a million accounts to use this.  You can follow certain hashtags you find interesting, and interact with those users.  Twitter ain't the most user-friendly social medium out there, but I'm ready to bet good American dollars, it's the most effective in terms of time and money.  At least for now."
Etsy,39c5bx,sevenfacedsin,2,Wed Jun 10 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's very much a shouting into the void platform. The only accounts that ever follow me are spam accounts, and I feel like if I use my seller account to follow other people, I'll be ignored for being a spam account. Meanwhile, I set up an Instagram account this week, and have found it far more beneficial. People seem to actually search craft hashtags on Instagram, which just isn't my experience at all with Twitter."
Etsy,39c5bx,araradia,4,Wed Jun 10 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"I use Twitter for marketing and it works incredibly well. I have programmed myself a neat little auto tweeting python script for Linux, and host automation. Contact me if you are interested."

Etsy,39c5bx,madxstitcher,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"The best way to get over that fear, is contributing genuinely helpful and useful and information to the Twitter community.  Honestly, they're hungry for quality, and they appreciate it when they see it.  Same as on any other platorm (ahem, reddit?).  The benefit, and the risk, to Twitter is that it's unfiltered.  This gives you bigger reach, and a greater moral responsibility to create quality content.  Generating more signal, in the ""signal-to-noise ratio"" is a surefire way to gain interest.  Anywhere."
Etsy,39c5bx,courtneyj,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"I've been using twitter for years, and it's the most annoying thing on the planet. I hashtag, but they don't work on mobile. Neither do pictures. If the platform doesn't work on mobile, it's pretty useless, IMO."
Etsy,39c5bx,FormSpaced,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, the world is getting more mobile.  But I have the converse gripe with Instagram.  Instagram seems to be the most popular platform for Etsy sellers (after facebook), and yet they don't allow clickable links, or desktop uploads, according to their TOS.  Instagram is a beautiful, image-heavy medium, with very little reach or ROI.  Twitter might be clunky, but their level of reach is indisputable.    I'm kind of an SEO/Social media geek.  I got into looking at Etsy because I was interested in their search engine!    Twitter was the last social media outlet I studied, and honestly I'm advocating for it because it legitimately gives the best ROI (I don't own Twitter stock).    The main thing is, Pinterest is too niche, Facebook is too limited (and getting more limited every day), Instagram is great (11 hashtags?!!?) but they actively discourage click-thrus and mobile uploads.  And Twitter is wide-reach, clickable, and global.  I'm not saying to abandon other platforms, I'm saying it's time to take Twitter seriously for business expansion.  The other thing I'm super geeky about is SEO, and SEO has taken me from text-based content to vlogging.  Why vlogging?  Because it's high-reach and under-exploited.  Same with Twitter.  It's there, it's wide open, and it is what you make of it.  There's a lot to ake of it."
Etsy,39c5bx,postcardigans,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"I've had zero ROI from my twitter account. I get maybe three favourites and one retweet a month, and no Etsy traffic, according to my stats. It's just not worth my time, which is why I've recently set it up to just mirror my blog and Instagram posts.   My biggest hitters are Tumblr and deviantART, actually. About half of my traffic comes from dA, and a good chunk of my sales come from Tumblr. And Tumblr works fantastically on mobile, which is a plus for me for two reasons. I can post to it without having to go upstairs to turn on my computer, and I know that other people who are on mobile can see the full content of the post and click on everything without having to click on anything else. People like to click on as few things as possible, which is the exact opposite of what you get with twitter. And if their phone is anything like mine, and not terribly responsive at times, having to click two or three times is a major deterrent."
Etsy,39c5bx,EtsyConvo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:50:03 2015 UTC,It's really easy to back yourself into a corner on it. I have to actively prune my lists and use tweetdeck to manage multiple channels. You definitely should try to find some tweet chats to jump into to connect with people directly.
Etsy,39c5bx,FitKeyChains,2,Wed Jun 10 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. My bf is a web developer and has been helping me with this. Day by day I get a few more followers. I get what you're saying about people just dumping their new products on Twitter. It's spamming basically. I'll get 40 posts in a matter of minutes. And this will simply be an Etsy shop dumping their products, one at a time onto Twitter. Annoying!"
Etsy,39c5bx,HildasAttic,2,Wed Jun 10 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'm probably guilty of too many ""hey, I just added a new product"" tweets, but I find the 140 character limit to be, well, rather limiting.  My informative posts usually exceed that limit, and I hate using multiple tweets to convey one thought."
Etsy,39c5bx,HildasAttic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yep... I agree... Speaking ""tweet"" does take a certain degree of creativity in order to get your message out there effectively, but do try to include other tweets in the mix in addition to your product announcements. Even if its just a quick short tip that has worked for you. The Twitter crowd is hungry for good info as @skunkhaus said, and it's so true :)"
Etsy,39c5bx,EtsyConvo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"I am trying to use twitter but I just dont know what to write or how to create followers, which suck because no one want to follor someone that has 16 followers. I dont know how to do it right I guess Ill leave it here and Ill follow back anyone or at least check it out and let me know wha I could do better Thanks! www.twitter.com/fitkeychains"
Etsy,39c5bx,EtsyConvo,2,Thu Jun 11 00:39:53 2015 UTC,"First: worth mentioning, you have 16 tweets and 16 followers.  That's 1 follower per tweet.  Not too shabby.  Second, get better at hashtags.  Think about hashtags the same way that you think of any other tag:  words that might lead an interested person to you.  The right balance is somewhere between interesting and relevant.  Play around, and you'll find it.  Third.  Follow more people.  Follow people you wish would follow you back and post interesting stuff.  I promise, you'll get some receiprocation if you do this earnestly.  Fourth--You're about 16 tweets too late for this, but if you're a new account and hashtag ""#myfirsttweet"" you'll get some charitable-minded followers right away.  Fifth--it's really all about the content.  Be helpful and interesting, and make your product relevant and meaningful to the public at large.  Twitter is all about brand building.  You do that by focusing on meaningfulness.  Sixth: once you have some high-quality content, tweet often.  The sweet spot for twitter is somewhere between 10 Am and 10 Pm, 10-20 tweets per day.  With hashtags.  (don't worry, you can automate this, so you don't constantly have to be online)"
Etsy,39c5bx,jmk816,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:57:08 2015 UTC,How do you feel about apps like Crowdfire? I just started using it and I'm not sure I like it all that much.
Etsy,39e68n,faith_trustpixiedust,2,Thu Jun 11 03:34:58 2015 UTC,"Some issues I see:   How big are your items? There are no dimensions. Having a mannequin to pose with the earrings would also be a great indicator of size. Your photos don't seem to be color balanced as there is a large variation in colors that I see on my monitor. As you know, add more items. The more items you have, more the chances you have of being noticed. Definitely work on the titles and tags. Add synonyms and popular phrases. I would fill out your payments section to say what types of payment you accept. Then I don't have to go through the checkout process and be surprised. Also tell me how you're shipping and packaging the items -- first-class parcel? Priority? in a box? padded envelope? I see you're located in NY -- is there a reason why your prices aren't round numbers? $.28 and $.61 are sort of random."
Etsy,39e68n,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I'll include dimensions in my ear ring listings. Like I said, my photographer friend is helping me with pictures, so I will be having him redo the photos.  Also, like I said, except for two listings, the other photos were done on my cell phone, and then edited, but can you go into more depth with what you men by color balance? I just played with some scales until they looked good to me :/  Working on the items. It takes me at least two weeks to knit or crochet a scar, and I have a lot of ideas in store, but it will take me a very long time to make them all and get them all online.   How can I improve my titles and tags? And synonyms how?  I thought I listed it as direct payment through Etsy? I wont accept payment from an outside source of etsy, so I figured you could pay with whatever you have, through etsy. Am I wrong in this thinking? I'm not sure how this would matter.  I ship in whatever's at the post office. Usually padded. So, list this?  My prices depend on the price of the yarn. What would being in Ny have to do with the prices? Is there something wrong with not round numbers?"
Etsy,39e68n,saleina,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"Not having round numbers is just a bit off...Why would you price something at 2.43 rather than 2.50, or 3.00?   If you lived outside of the United states it makes a bit more sense because of currency changes. so 4.00 here in the US is different then 4.00 in European countries.   People are more likely to purchase a round or .99 or even .98 then they are strange numbers.   as the reviewer stated, it seems random :)"
Etsy,39e68n,saleina,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:32:00 2015 UTC,"well, it definitely isn't random, but I see your point. My prices are based off the price of the yarn used. I figured this way people save as much as they can with me because I'm not going to give them a random number. The yarn wasn't priced at nice, round numbers, but I guess I can round up or down if it's really that weird looking."
Etsy,39e68n,saleina,2,Thu Jun 11 07:03:27 2015 UTC,"I would suggest rounding to the nearest 0 then. So maybe something priced at 5.65 would go to 5.70. I always round upward, or you can go to the .89 or .99. That way the prices don't seem so random.   Also, that is very kind of you! a lot of China ""mom and pop"" shops use random pricing which would make me (pesronally) question your products because of how common I see random pricing by overseas shops, or the wholesale/China/rip-off shops.   :)"
Etsy,39e68n,saleina,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:18:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice! I thought I was doing a nice gesture, but I'll change the prices. Thank you!"
Etsy,39e68n,LittleBlueEyes,2,Thu Jun 11 07:24:01 2015 UTC,no problem! I completely understand.   If you feel like changing your prices isn't the best thing...You should DEFINITELY convey what you just told me in your shop welcoming. Say how you like to pass on savings and that is why your prices are unique! I think this will also help customers understanding the pricing :)
Etsy,39e68n,LittleBlueEyes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"I think I will try this. It can't hurt, can it? If it doesn't work, I'll just round up the prices, but keep the message The way I see it, they're still saving immensely. I'll never price a scarf at 50-60 dollars when it only cost me less than 10 dollars to make, you know?"
Etsy,39e68n,LittleBlueEyes,2,Thu Jun 11 07:28:36 2015 UTC,"It's completely understandable, However also keep in mind that creating and selling is much more than just the material costs.   You don't want to sell yourself to short!   You have cost for materials, time put in, (like any other job) and then of course shipping.   If you have below the average pricing then you are actually doing yourself a disfavor, as well as others in that community.   Especially because to me, as a person who sees scarfs that are usually 20+ dollars, and then see one that is 10ish dollars I would think what is wrong with the scarf or think it isn't made out of better materials.   It is definitely a trade off.   But there is a reason why those who sell their stuff for more also tend to get more sales. Those who purchase things (especially handmade items) are looking for quality. Quality priced items will sell better than cheaper items because there is that belief in western society (I'm not terribly sure in other areas of the world) that a higher cost equates to better quality!"
Etsy,39e68n,littletinypiranha,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:34:12 2015 UTC,"no no no, I completely understand that. I'm not selling myself short, trust me. Well, I don't think I am. I'll pm you more about it, if you on't mind I'm just saying if I knot a scar and it takes two balls of yarn and each ball cost 2 bucks, I'm not going to market it as a 60 dollar scarf because frankly, if the yarn is that cheap, it's not the best quality. I have a scarf that's done near 60 buck, and that's because not only is my time and effort going into it, but it's great quality yarn, so it will cost more. I'm just saying I'm not one of those cheapos buying 2 dollar acrylic yarn that feels like crap anyway and trying to sell it as if it's from Dolce and Gabana or something."
Etsy,39e68n,marctz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:41:45 2015 UTC,It helps to get as many items as you can listed.  11 items won't get you a lot of sales.
Etsy,39ampw,PatSabre12,7,Wed Jun 10 13:26:46 2015 UTC,you can already automatically send coupon codes to anyone that buys from your store. and technically you are spamming - - you're sending unsolicited messages.

Otherwise I'd have harvested all our Etsy customers email addresses to add to our mailing list.  Any time I buy from someone on Etsy and find myself getting emails outside of the transaction I won't go back to them because I never consented to be sent promotional messaging.  I'd suggest if you want to stick with contacting them with a discount, either use what Etsy has set up (as someone pointed out) or include a printed discount code in their shipment."

Unsolicited messages are always unwelcome, this one took the cake, though."
Etsy,39ampw,artlessvandal,2,Wed Jun 10 18:13:02 2015 UTC,I wonder if there is a way to automatically do the same for folks that favourite the shop or an item...
Etsy,39ampw,heatkitchen,3,Wed Jun 10 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"There isn't a way to do it automatically. I've gotten a message like that before from a seller when I favorited an item and it didn't really bother me, because I was about to purchase the item anyways and I ended up getting a discount for it, but shortly after I noticed a lot of conversations here calling it spam. Then I thought, what if I got one of those messages every single time I added something to my favorites....yeesh!"
Etsy,39ampw,ofmyhats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but it would be neat to see Etsy add something like that. I do know that if they've Favorited your shop or items, Etsy's regular Promo emails will contain a mix of your items (along with other items they've saved) which helps remind them about your shop."
Etsy,39ampw,araradia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"I would be so annoyed to get those. It's why I keep my favorites private.  People favorite things for different reasons, pretty picture, going to use in a treasury, or just want to bookmark. Most people wouldn't buy even with a coupon."
Etsy,39ampw,OceanSiren,2,Wed Jun 10 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"Same. Even the treasury convos annoy me a bit, especially when they tell you to include them in a new treasury.   Both sending a coupon to people who favorite your items and sending a convo to past buyers with a coupon code is considered spam which is against Etsy rules."
Etsy,39ampw,araradia,2,Wed Jun 10 20:23:57 2015 UTC,I think treasury people forget that you get an automatic notice if your item is in a treasury.

Etsy,39ampw,CasperJ82,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:52:58 2015 UTC,if it's after the fact and they didn't know they would recieve it then it's not really a bribe. tho if they then start leaving it to get a code then it would be.
Etsy,399oiu,marctz,3,Wed Jun 10 06:56:00 2015 UTC,"Hey there!   So I really like your pictures, and I definitely think that they are great quality and that you don't have any problems when it comes to that.   Your descriptions seem really good, but your tags are really short. You look look into adding as much as you possibly can to the tags. So instead of geometric, use geometric poster, or geometric print.... etc...   Your titles do not match your tags very well. Put a lot of words into your title to promote key words that others may enter into etsy to find your work.   Fill out your policies page! This is blank!!! YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST!!!!!!  I like the Deer poster, but other than that I personally don't find any other piece attractive as I don't see a purpose in having a picture of somebody in geometric form.   Do you have the ability to take pictures of other people, and re-create them into geometric forms? (kinda like custom orders)   I am not at all meaning to disrespect you at all, but i'm wondering if you are selling art which would attract buyers.   I would also work on getting more listings up!   You are also definitely in a saturated area, so making sure that everything possible is filled out is a great way to promote sales/more views/more traffic.   Look into the Etsy sellers handbook!   Good luck!"
Etsy,399oiu,saleina,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you Saleina. You did not disrespect me in any way, thank you so much for advice. You make very good points. Also about the people in the picture that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for telling me about the policies, I totally overlooked that part, I would not have noticed it if you had not told me. Thanks again! :D"
Etsy,399oiu,maria_ivanovna,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:53:20 2015 UTC,"I love your style, but I also wouldn't put a poster of a random person in my home. Animals, on the other hand... Maybe try making pets posters? Cats are very popular, and you can offer commissioned work as well.  Also try to put your art in mock frames, or photograph it in your home. People love to see what physical product would look like."
Etsy,399oiu,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:39:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I will definetely not make more people haha. I will also put them in mock frames and photograph them in my home, those are really good tips. Very much appreciated!"
Etsy,399oiu,FormSpaced,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are bad but, as others have mentioned, it's the random people part that's not so great.   I would definitely suggest looking into doing custom work for the people part. If it's not too difficult to make a photograph into a polygon shape art, you could definitely advertise it that way instead.   Can you also do the polygon thing for landscape? How about pictures where only the outline of the polygon is shown? Not sure what that would end up looking like but seems kind of cool in my head :P Good luck!"
Etsy,399oiu,FormSpaced,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:26:00 2015 UTC,The random people tip has been strongly noted! Thank you for the inspiration. I will try it :D
Etsy,399oiu,OceanSiren,2,Wed Jun 10 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely include policies for your shop. When I created mine, I referenced other people's terms to get a better understanding of what to include/not include in my terminology. As I read the forums about people having issues from sales/customers I tweak my polices to make them clearer. It's a process. It will take time for you to have a cohesive shop.  Fill out the About page as well. This gives you a chance to tell your story. How did you start your shop? What is your background? Tell customers and viewers a little about you. I think it personalizes your shop and makes it welcoming to everyone. The About page allows you to add photos that represent your shop. Include an image of your workstation. Possibly an image of a graphic half way through the process. This will qualify the work as well. What program(s) do you use? What inspires you to create a particular image?  This is my 2 cents. I am new myself. I am constantly learning new techniques from the forums on both reddit and Etsy. They are both great resources.  You have great images. And they are definitely on trend with today's graphics. I would add more to your shop as soon as you can. You will have a nice collection to show.  Good luck! Great banner/logo!"
Etsy,399oiu,sirius_moonlight,2,Wed Jun 10 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the compliments! I will put this on my list of things to do. What you said about the about page is a very good tip!

Etsy,399oiu,ChrisIsBored,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"Your items are impressive! In addition to getting advice on here, I would also suggest making a thread on the forums page on Etsy as well. :)  There are many very experienced sellers there that gave me advice when I first started and I don't think I would be able to give as good advice as they do."
Etsy,399quq,guskillah,2,Wed Jun 10 07:22:29 2015 UTC,"You should really fill out your policies page.   Although you have many sales, I would be very hesitant to purchase from you because I don't know any of your policies. Returns/refunds/exchanges? Shipping time? Damages? How do you ship? how do you authenticate things? Etc...etc....   Also it is important to have your policies filled out to make sure that customers understand where you are coming from, and that way you have a policies page to fall back on if you're questioned on anything.   I think your photos are pretty bland. They aren't bright, and are actually quite dark So i would recommend retaking them in a brighter light. Natural lighting works really well. Maybe buy a form mannequin head?   I don't know anything about pricing, so I'm not sure if you're priced low or high sorry :(   But I think you will definitely see more allure once you have filled out everything, and adjusted your photos :)"
Etsy,399quq,saleina,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:42:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. I forgot about the policy info and i need to fill that out as soon as possible. I need to get better lighting but the form mannequin head doesnt work with young buyers might have to make some of my friends take pictures with the hats. Again thank you for taking time and looking at my shop and giving me advice.
Etsy,399quq,k80k80k80,2,Wed Jun 10 22:29:40 2015 UTC,Great idea for a shop! I would say that you need some better quality photos - the lighting is not good and the hats look like you just pulled them off of your head. Perhaps you can fill them out with tissue paper.
Etsy,399quq,must_kill_moe_WEEE,2,Wed Jun 10 10:04:00 2015 UTC,Thank you. I purchased a new Canon Camera just need to mess with it a bit more. Some of the hats are 20-30 years old and the shape with stay like that.
Etsy,396qy7,doryfishie,5,Tue Jun 9 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"Bah, giving etsy a bad name. Glad you can see the funny side though.  What kind of thing are they saying to you?"
Etsy,396qy7,auntie-matter,2,Tue Jun 9 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"Lol, calling me a moron, 'damn', 'damn two year old', 'get a damn grip', 'some god damn nerve'...I initially filed a charge back but then when she started hurling abuse I decided that it wasn't worth my time since it was only a $7.59 purchase. I left all 1-star feedback. It's entertaining, I've been buying on Etsy for 8 years and this is the first time I've ever encountered anything like this. You would think if I were truly the problem other sellers would have had an issue by now."
Etsy,396qy7,littletinypiranha,3,Tue Jun 9 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"The seller should certainly have been a lot more professional. Irregardless of who is right or wrong, nothing good comes out of hurling insults at each other shakes head.   How long into the sale was it before you filed for a charge back? You mentioned that there was no communication from either-end so do you mean that you didn't try contacting them first before filing?"

Etsy,396qy7,autourbanbot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:35:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of irregardless :      Used by people who ignorantly mean to say regardless. According to webster, it is a word, but since the prefix ""ir"" and the suffx ""less"" both mean ""not or with"" they cancel each other out, so what you end up with is regard. When you use this to try to say you don't care about something, you end up saying that you do. Of course everyone knows what you mean to say and only a pompous,rude asshole will correct you.     Wife: ""Irregardless is not a word, dummy""  Husband: ""Kiss my ass bitch! I'm still going to the strip club tonight!""    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

Etsy,396w5l,KristyKri,10,Tue Jun 9 18:09:42 2015 UTC,There are no photos of a baby in the sleeping bag. Plus as far as I can see you only have 2 items listed - most people see more items as more legitimate. Additionally there are some grammar mistakes in your description - this may not bother some people but if they're already uncertain it may push them away.
Etsy,396w5l,Rosydoodles,0,Tue Jun 9 18:44:25 2015 UTC,This was an amazing advice. With cooperation all the grammar mistakes should be fixed now. I do agree that a baby in the sleeping bag is extremely important. I had pictures with baby with my old designs not with these yet. Photo sessions and finding a baby takes a while and its definetly on the TO DO list.

Etsy,396w5l,affinityxxxx,11,Tue Jun 9 22:48:40 2015 UTC,It says you opened on June 6th. It's only been open for 3 days. You haven't given it enough time.
Etsy,396w5l,affinityxxxx,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"That's true, however at least to me etsy was hyped as this amazing place where there is a ton of people sharing and buying handmade things, but i basically got no views at all for 3 days. Where were all the people?   But ok i'l be patient! :)"
Etsy,396w5l,affinityxxxx,4,Tue Jun 9 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"It is also a very saturated marketplace. It's easy to get lost in the sea of goods. Keywords and tags are important, as well as outside marketing of your shop."
Etsy,396w5l,affinityxxxx,2,Tue Jun 9 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"Just saw this: http://etsytrainer.com/how-to-create-the-best-tags-for-etsy-items-for-more-sales-and-seo/  You might consider redoing some of your tags. For example, you have ""clothes"" as a tag. People won't be able to find you with a tag that is so vague. Get descriptive and imagine what words you'd search for for your products."
Etsy,396w5l,sneaky_dragon,-1,Tue Jun 9 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks alot. Will look into it now.  One thing though, I can't change the first 4 keyword's as it was inputed automatically when i defined my category just the last 13 keywords. Will read up on tags now."
Etsy,396w5l,OceanSiren,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Whoa, I haven't seen that before. I've been able to make all 13 of my tags on my own. I'm going to have to look more into that."
Etsy,396w5l,smallstakes,2,Tue Jun 9 20:07:50 2015 UTC,The first four are auto-generated by the category you list your item in. You still get 13 tags to use yourself.

Etsy,396w5l,hannah-christine,3,Tue Jun 9 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"For me personally as a parent, I would only buy a product like this from a store where at least I know (or assume?) it's been tested or approved for sale. There's too many horror stories about unsafe baby items to take the risk. Not that yours looks unsafe at all, but I would never buy something like this from etsy."

Etsy,397lvz,rubyscarlette,2,Tue Jun 9 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely no reason the one thing should be related to the other.  Chalk it up to unfortunate coincidence.  Have you taken a look at your shop stats and google analytics to see if you're getting traffic but no sales, or no traffic/no sales?  That could be telling.    Also consider what other factors might be in play:  slow season?  are your Etsy search results showing up lower?  Did you get any reviews less than 5 stars recently?  Did you change any of your tags or product descriptions?  Did you make significant changes to the way you photograph or describe your product?  Anything else you can think about?"

Etsy,397lvz,skunkhaus,8,Tue Jun 9 21:37:28 2015 UTC,"Gotcha!  It's peak wedding season, which means that anyone who was trying to have a June wedding should have already placed an order by now...Consider making a ""rush shipping"" tag and see if that helps at all."

You'd be amazed the amount of people who don't read the info and will not even know it's supposed to be a card. Or the sizing for it (also it's pretty hard to visualise sizing from some numbers written down, I wana see it).  Also I would put the link to your store after the info to do with the item you're viewing. They've not even gotten as far as reading about the one they clicked on before you're directing them away from it.  Lastly - do more! You need more items, get working on some more puns! They're really cute but 9 items is only 9 chances to be found in a search."
Etsy,397fh7,hebejebez,4,Tue Jun 9 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"Just to add, it's not just the sizing I would be interested in seeing but also the quality of the print job as well as how the image is going to be printed on the card.   Does a red background mean a fully red card or is the image still framed by a white border?"
Etsy,397fh7,littletinypiranha,2,Wed Jun 10 02:17:59 2015 UTC,You're right this is a good point it would look entirely different with a white border.
Etsy,397fh7,hebejebez,2,Wed Jun 10 02:53:29 2015 UTC,this is a great suggestion!

""you are working on samples and getting your specs together?"" This is something you do BEFORE you start marketing your products to people — not after. Dont make your customers have to ask questions to find out what you are offering.  Sure sometimes you might miss something, and the occasional question needs to be answered. But we shouldn't have to ask EVERY question.  As a customer I dont even know how your box fits together - how will i get it - what assembly is required - is it crush proof. Or even where you are located ( which i am guessing is NOT in the USA)"
Etsy,394k23,JSqueaks,6,Tue Jun 9 05:23:24 2015 UTC,I would use like cardboard or a print backing board to sandwich it so it is harder to bend and then stick it into one of those bubble mailers.

Etsy,392z6q,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:03:28 2015 UTC,The label does indeed say commercial plus. Can I take the package to any post office and resend it with the original label? I was planning on taking to my usual post office instead since I have never had a problem with them.
Etsy,392z6q,OceanSiren,2,Mon Jun 8 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you shouldn't have to repay for the shipping. If your package is marked as insignificant postage, tell them that your postage was correct and that you're sending it via commercial plus and they should just take it. If your package isn't marked, I'd just shove it into the quick post area if you have one in your local PO since the workers usually are oblivious to these things."
Etsy,392z6q,sneaky_dragon,0,Mon Jun 8 22:46:51 2015 UTC,That I am not sure of. I would just physically go to the post office and explain the situation there and see if the label is still valid.
Etsy,392z6q,madxstitcher,-8,Mon Jun 8 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"This is why I just flat rate everything with stamps.com. There's no way I'm going to ever send more than 70 pounds of anything, and all the postal employees know what that is."
Etsy,392z6q,scribbling_des,6,Mon Jun 8 23:27:46 2015 UTC,That sounds very wasteful.  Especially for those of us with light packages.  Like OP.
Etsy,392z6q,mxlabel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"I pay an average of 2.50 to ship my packages, priority is what? 5.75? That definitely adds up when you're sending about 8 packages a day."

Last summer I spent hours and hours (I have summers off) liking, faving and doing treasuries. In June, July and August I had one returning customer from April, and one new customer in August. All that time spent doing 'games' and I got just one customer. I stopped with the games and in September my business started picking up.  The best thing to do is try to get your items on the first few pages of the search engine through tags/titles. That way you get seen by people actually searching for your products.  Good luck!"
Etsy,39589m,sirius_moonlight,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:41:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. I'm experimenting with SEO and making few new versions of sundial. We'll see how it goes.
Etsy,39589m,dearwilde,7,Tue Jun 9 11:38:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would rather have followers and admirers who chose to do so because they like my shop, instead of that follow-for-follow stuff. It might ""look"" better to have a higher number, but those follows and likes are essentially worthless if they're only there because of reciprocity."
Etsy,39589m,fairycakeshake,5,Tue Jun 9 12:04:17 2015 UTC,"Favoriting and liking games are complete crap. Totally useless and I'm sorry but I think anyone who actually plays along with that stuff are total idiots (you know...those promo games in the etsy forums??).  A more useful way to spend your time would be perfecting your product, making new stuff, work on SEO.  Anyway I looked at your shop and it looks good! Nice photos, just need to add more items."
Etsy,39589m,sirius_moonlight,3,Tue Jun 9 11:07:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for honest response. I'm trying different approaches as I said I'm new in this so I'm trying as many things as possible. I'm also testing different SEOs and I have in development few new versions of sundials.
Etsy,392ul1,nikstwosticks,3,Mon Jun 8 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"I found what helped me with that nervousness is to make some things for friends and coworkers, especially with baby shower gifts. Then I was able to casually ask them about what I made, sorta like ""hey, how are those burp cloths holding up?"" Or ""does that diaper clutch fit your needs?"" (And hopefully not sound like I'm fishing for compliments). Almost everyone has given me positive feedback and in turn requested something else that they pay for.   Some if my closer friends, I've just given them something and asked them to be a product tester to give me their honest opinion on how it works/holds up.   Plus, at my job I'm able to work on some of my stuff during down time, (well, mainly just pinning fabric) which allows me to talk about how I do what I do, and they can see the work that goes into it.  As for Facebook, I tried it once and it didn't do much for me, same with etsy advertising, so I don't anymore. I post pics several times a week on instagram, which I share on tumblr and twitter, and a select few will go on Facebook. I don't want to spam my family and friends too much. Then, when I list a new product, I share it on twitter, tumblr, Google+ and Pinterest through the etsy share thing.   Lastly, (sorry this got long. I'm a wordy person) I post to Craftori. I've mentioned it a lot on here, and at least half of my views come from that site. Its free, (but you can pay to stay on the front page) and similar to Pinterest , except the posts are from the maker themselves, and clicking on the picture takes you directly to the shop."

Etsy,392ul1,sneaky_dragon,2,Tue Jun 9 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it looks like you're in a very very saturated market. You also need to look into synonyms of your keywords like hairbands, hair bands, head bands, hair wrap, etc.  I tried searching for ""giraffe fabric headband"" and I was surprised that your item didn't show up until I checked the tags and title.  I personally don't believe in paying for advertising. I'd rather send goods to someone popular and have them promote it or review it for me."
Etsy,392ul1,madxstitcher,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, saturation is certainly an issue. I will switch up some tags and titles and see what helps. I review them once a week. Thank you!"

Instead what I do is I boost my page for a dollar a day, and that's my sole advertising budget. I get about 4-5 new page likes a day, and the more I get from that, the more traffic gets funnelled back to my shop from posts. It seems like nothing's happening at first, but once you start to get followers in the triple digits, things finally start to pay off."

Etsy,391chb,marketingwoes,2,Mon Jun 8 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"I sell the same things as you and it is daunting. Some stores say it can take months for the first sale. I have been very fortunate with 80 sales in first 3 weeks. Just make sure pictures are sharp, titles and tags are correct. I still don't show up very high up in searches so maybe that takes more time. I guess at the start you have to rely a lot on social media etc to draw traffic. $2 on a well written facebook post can go along way in terms of traffic, if your listings and descriptions are on point you will sell."

I'm looking to reopen and I even have a partner willing to help give out samples and stuff but the online markets are just crazy now it seems. Thanks for the advice with social media posts. Congrats on your sales so far, that's a good start up number."
Etsy,391chb,PaintballKitty,2,Mon Jun 8 15:59:13 2015 UTC,It's tough when your so passionate about what you make and it can feel like no one wants it but it's going well. Slower than I had hoped but no one is ever realistic when it comes to online sales and it is good to aim high :) Welcome back
Etsy,391chb,rabbit555,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"What are the ""ups"" you mention that distinguish you from your competitors?  Do they solve a problem for your customer?  Whatever they are, if you're not already doing so, emphasize these in your item description and use related keywords in your tags and title. Don't try to compete for all the customers, imagine a specific customer and try to zero in on them."
Etsy,38zu3l,jefferycheung,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:34:11 2015 UTC,"I have a set format for all of my listings.  Granted, they're embroidery patterns, so it won't be an exact transition to t-shirts.  But I have   [say what you see title] cross stitch pattern | [size in inches] | [number of colours used]  The titles themselves tend to be a bit bland, and are usually Adjective Noun.  They don't need to be super flashy, because it's pretty much the entire rest of the title and listing that matters.  As long as no two designs have the same title, it seems to be working for me.  Figure out what it is about the listings that matter to your potential buyer.  Is it that they're t-shirts?  The size or colours of the shirts?  The designs on them?  That's what you most want in your title."

They ""drop ship"" which means they print your poster or canvas, and ship it directly to your customer, with your name and address as the return address (so it's like you're shipping it). I ordered a few for myself to check the quality and I really liked it. There's no minimum order of any kind - I just print on demand.  Don't forget to get manufacturer approval from Etsy! They already approved printdropper for me, so you shouldn't have a problem. It can take a few weeks though."
Etsy,38zz6u,purpleducklingf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:45:25 2015 UTC,I am thinking about starting to drop ship. What happens when something gets damaged? Does printdropper package things well?   Edit: Am I reading their website right a 16x20 would be over $16. I have to do some math and see if the convenience would be worth that.
Etsy,38zz6u,jbbnorth,2,Mon Jun 8 18:28:38 2015 UTC,PrintDropper rep here.. we completely take care of any damage 100%. You just let us know and we take care of it at no expense to you.
Etsy,38zz6u,JimFlim,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't had anything damaged, but if it were, printdropper's policies are clear that they are not responsible and you would need to order and pay for another shipment. Their posters are very secure, they ship is a heavy-duty cardboard tube, and the canvases ship in a box. I recommend ordering a few for yourself to make sure you like the shipping and quality of product.   As for the price, I'm not sure where you're seeing that number. A 16x20 poster is $9.86 and a 16x20 canvas is $33.61 https://printdropper.com/products#posters-prints"
Etsy,38zz6u,purpleducklingf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:16:34 2015 UTC,"For the $16, I was adding 9.86 plus the 5.79 shipping cost. So it wasn't over 16, it was $15.65. whoops. After doing some math it actually is pretty comparable since I am not paying for shipping twice.  Something to think about. Thanks!"
Etsy,38zz6u,jbbnorth,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"These policies are part of the reason I haven't switched to Printdropper yet. I like their print quality and prices, but absolutely detest that they wipe their hands of any problems that could occur during shipping. I've had the USPS damage countless poster tubes over the years, so the thought of being responsible for replacing every damaged poster myself is keeping me away from using them. Especially when my current print shop will replace anything that is damaged/misprinted without question.  I couldn't get away with telling a customer that there is nothing I am willing to do if a poster is damaged, and feel that Printdropper shouldn't get away with it either. Reprinting and reshipping something that is damaged would cost them practically nothing and is a total tax write off, so I don't get why they are so unwilling to take responsibility for stuff getting damaged during shipping."
Etsy,38zz6u,phillip_fryman,2,Mon Jun 8 21:58:28 2015 UTC,PrintDropper rep here.. not sure where this info came from but we actually 100% stand behind any damaged products and replace them at our expense.

You can also order a ""starter"" kit which sends you out various types of paper to see what you like to print on most!    Posters   Overnightprints has great prices on posters! They usually have a sale on posters, and I believe you can buy them individually (at least I have in the past) I have gotten posters from them for .99 on a sale, but they also have different ones throughout the months.    Print covers/backings   I use Clearbags to get these materials. It is good quality and will protect your prints! There are various sizes to match print sizes. The backings are great to make sure that your prints do not fold, and look more professional."

Etsy,38zz6u,BananaFinn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:46:46 2015 UTC,"Most of my work is custom stuff, so I basically print on demand. I started at a local print shop, but they charged a lot and were sorta difficult to deal with so I now print my posters at Costco. I actually don't live near a costco, but have a membership through a family member so I have the poster shipped (2 day shipping) to my house and its still way cheaper then my local shop. The costco posters are printed on photo paper which isn't ideal in my mind, but works for now until I figure out something better. I've heard kinkos and OfficeMax/Office Depot have decent prices on poster printing too."
Etsy,38zz6u,jbbnorth,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned about expense then what I did will be of no help, but I bought an epson r2880 printer and still use it for all my etsy prints. It was a risk, (and on sale at the time) and I was fortunate that I started out at a popular local holiday craft show and earned back my investment the first day. I think there's cheaper models, and perhaps some secondhand ones out there.  It's definitely the easiest way to fulfill orders, but the upfront cost is definitely a hurdle. It lets me experiment with putting up prints that might (and do) have zero sales, but my only loss was the time spent drawing."

Etsy,38uggh,araradia,7,Sun Jun 7 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Hey fellow IMAM-er! This is very odd indeed. I'd politely but firmly word a message that explains that you are not accepting authorized re-sellers at this time. Its true that you cannot control what a customer might do with your product once she purchases it, but this situation is one of those that just feels weird enough to want to avoid it all together, you know? You'll see from other postings here that sometimes its best to trust your gut about an odd customer request.   I've been to your shop before but haven't see photos of the entire lipstick; do you have labels/any sort of branding on the tubes? If not, consider amping that up so that there is never a doubt that your lipstick came from your shop.   Give some thought to raising your prices; don't sell yourself short. Aside, lipstick molds are a pain to deal with, and your blood, sweat, and many tears from using one need to be rewarded."
Etsy,38uggh,trinaluna,3,Sat Jun 6 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"I would be wary of this opportunity. While it is great for getting more business / getting your name out there, you don't have control over who the product is being sold to or how it's being advertised.

In your case, you would want to sell to as many people as possible as long as they don't leave you with the impression that they are trying to replicate your product or selling it as their own.  Edit: Also check if your target audience is also her target audience. That is mostly what I meant by who the product is being sold to."

Depending on what your Etsy business is on, you could design them accordingly, maybe using a specific shape, or your logo as a die-cut. People tend to throw away the typical 2"" x 3.5"" ones rather than specially designed ones. Even the paper you use could make a difference.   These processes, though, are not cheap. If you're willing to invest a bit on them, it will most definitely be worth it because you will be giving people a very well formed brand to remember you."

Etsy,38v0o8,phoebeandjuniper,2,Sun Jun 7 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"Including art of some sort is a good idea, and business cards are so cheap that it wouldn't be a big deal if they were tossed. I get a lot from sellers with coupon codes and tend to save those!"
Etsy,38v0o8,Christypaints,2,Sun Jun 7 03:53:46 2015 UTC,Have a business card that has a 10% off offer or something. Then people definitely won't throw them away.   I think its worth it. I throw out tons of business cards but when I'm collecting them I put the ones I want to keep into a different pocket so I can remember to go look at the shops that I really felt drawn to later.  Also it gives you something else to put into your packaging when you mail out your wares.
Etsy,38v0o8,skunkhaus,2,Sun Jun 7 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, they're worth it.  Count on them costing somewhere between $.25-$.50 a piece, if they're decent quality.  If you actually hand them out to appropriate people and don't just sit on them, you can make your ROI back pretty easily with just a few extra customers.  Not to mention, they do add brand equity (important!) and distinguish you from the big amorphous pool of ""just Etsy"" as someone with a unique identity within that giant flea market.  Get business cards and make sure they're ""wow"" business cards."
Etsy,38v0o8,DistressedOwl,3,Sun Jun 7 16:28:55 2015 UTC,I keep business cards that are magnets forever. Expensive but useful

I put together text and images early in the week and specify what day it's for, so I can easily do it from my phone. Takes me about 10 min every few hours.   I do think in the future when we're millionaires (har Har har) that we'll either hire someone or let someone intern for us to put it on their resume. I was once a social media intern, and it's been kinda useless, but I like having it on my resume!"
Etsy,38u417,HildasAttic,2,Sat Jun 6 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"Tumblr is a great one if you want to plan your week ahead of time. You can set up a ""queue"" of posts and choose the day and time you want them to be posted. So if you write a couple different posts Monday, you can put them in your queue to be posted Tuesday at four, Thursday at noon, Saturday at eight pm, etc., and it will happen automatically! I love that about Tumblr."

Etsy,38tt7b,PandaPandamonium,5,Sat Jun 6 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it is absolutely true in my experience.  I no longer ever put my store in vacation mode and instead I offer a delayed shipping vacation sale during the time I am away.  It's a bit frustrating, as you have to do a lot of product editing before you go, making sure to edit both the first line of text in every listing as well as the shipping profiles, and your after sale message so that all the customers are clear that your item will not ship for x weeks.  I also usually use EtsyOnSale.com to create a blanket sale across all or most items.  Doing this rather then VM'ing my store has prevented me for facing the drop that occurred and lasted for months afters the first time I had to take a significant summer trip across country.  That may help you in the future, but truth is that since you just came back, you are going to need to really work hard on social media to try to regain your views.  Build a bunch of treasuries with other people's work that you like as well and hopefully they will reciprocate with some treasuries that include you."
Etsy,38tt7b,woodeye,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:13:55 2015 UTC,EtsyOnSale.com   How does this work? Seems like a neat idea.
Etsy,38tt7b,Christypaints,2,Sat Jun 6 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"EtsyOnSale is an awesome tool. You can do one sale for free to try it out, but after that you purchase credits that you can use to schedule sales events; check out the Pricing link at the top of the website for details. You choose when the campaign starts, when it ends, what the discount is (percent, free shipping, only on one section or storewide), and changes your price to a red strike-thru with the sale price (bringing attention to the discount) and puts everything back to how it was when the sale ends. I find it to be more enticing to customers than a coupon code or manually inputted sale."
Etsy,38tt7b,trinaluna,3,Sat Jun 6 23:05:38 2015 UTC,It takes me about 2 weeks every time to get back and running at normal speed.   I usually take 3 weeks off twice a year.

Dive. Big.  Time.  Took a month for sales to recover.   Needed to retool and recover from Christmas rush.  New build process will make it so that I should either be able to crank things out or lee on top of it and also scale up.  Took every $ of earrings back into business in my 'vacation mode.'
Etsy,38tt7b,tom8o,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually done vacation mode, but I've taken long stretches time off my shop and it really does effect views and sales.

Etsy,38tt7b,araradia,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:04:41 2015 UTC,"I was scared of this too and have opted to use extended shipping times + a discount code if I'm away for more than a day or two. I find that even when I'm extending processing times just due to heavy volume of orders, like around christmas, buyers rarely acknowledge the delay or think it's an exaggeration. It has lead to a few instances of ""has my order shipped, I need it tomorrow"" when their scheduled ship date is days away, so just make it as clear as possible. If you offer a discount code during the absence it's a good indicator of who saw the announcement and you can send a convo snippet to buyers who don't use it and therefor may not realize."

I've publicly shamed many an asshole and even ''banned'' a person from ever coming back. Don't let other sellers tell you it's a bad idea to look like you're retaliating or that it's unprofessional to respond publicly in a disrespectful way. I've only sold more and more as time goes on, my responses have never hurt my order flow... ever. SCREW these spoiled, self righteous Walmart princesses and their low view of people they give money to. I started my etsy store to be free of this bullshit, not to embrace it and work with it. No body reads ANYTHING, not your policies, not your store front message, not your descriptions, not even the titles. And 9 times out of 10 if they do, they're just another seller being nosey. I'm sorry your first one had to be like this, hopefully she's as stupid as she sounds and doesn't even know how to leave you a review."
Etsy,38oyhv,seeingRobots,17,Fri Jun 5 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not an etsy seller. I do freelance design. This is still a new thing for your wife. It's a lesson I think everyone learns eventually, how to spot a bad customer, and the ability to walk away as quickly as possible.  As far as one star reviews go, whenever I look at an online rating (Amazon or etsy or whatever) I always look for one-star reviews first. I figure most 5 star reviews are probably fluff or people being nice or whatever. The gold is in the one-star review. If the one-one star review is a crazy crummy customer, you can spot them a mile away. Sometimes I don't even go to the good reviews, I just see the number of 5 star reviews and read the crazy one-star reviews and I'm ready to make a purchase  Edit: also, it sounds like she's not charging enough. She shouldn't be putting in 18 hour days."
Etsy,38oyhv,phoebeandjuniper,3,Fri Jun 5 22:48:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, once you can pinpoint someone who just won't be satisfied it makes it easier to avoid them. Etsy is a weird environment though compared to other freelance work, mostly because of the review system. It's pretty skewed on there where anything less than 5 stars feels like the end of the world. I often wish I could say to a customer ""okay, enough!"" and just walk away, but that potential review still scares me! After you build up more and more positive reviews it's easier to brush off bad ones."
Etsy,38oyhv,DistressedOwl,8,Sat Jun 6 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"30 hours of work for this person is appalling. I know you are worried about reviews as a new shop, but you cannot let this sort of thing happen. Once you are more seasoned at spotting the difficult customers, you will have the ability to decline their business. Not only do you not need to do this, you simply cannot afford it in time, money, or emotional stress.  Also don't worry so much about getting a bad review. They do suck, but they will not destroy you. You seem like really awesome people, I hate to see someone taking advantage. You must recognize that people like Anita have little to no potential to further your business or your happiness. Better to cut them off early."

Still you made the right call. If you're not dying for the money then don't let your Etsy customer interactions get to you. I always strive to provide excellent customer service, but I had one occasion where a customer was asking about the most expensive necklace in my shop($185), it had been in there for over 2 years but after a few emails about converting the stone size from mm to inches, and taking pictures of it next to coins, I could tell she was ignorant and difficult. I just ended it, I said ,""I don't think this is the one for you,"" and I went on with my life pretty confident that I dodged a bullet."

Etsy,38oyhv,FormSpaced,3,Sat Jun 6 06:56:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, design work (whether it's wedding invitations, interior design, graphic design) many people do not understand the amount of time it takes to develop. It's very hard to justify your time to people like that. I was an interior designer at an architecture firm for 5 years in NYC. It AMAZED me how people haggled over fees when you spent hundreds of hours on changes they requested. And we were being up front about fees. Mid-construction and the client wants to add walls, new light fixtures etc. Anyway, some people you have to just cut off. Life is too short to allow people like that in your life and have them affect your business like that. It affects everything you do. You guys are handling this as professionally as possible. If it means a bad review, so be it. You already have good reviews, and you will continue to get them. It's the world we live in. I would stick to your guns at this point. If Anita files a complaint, you have all the back up messages proving the case."
Etsy,38oyhv,meglolz,3,Sat Jun 6 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"Your wife is very brave. If it were me, I'd probably give in to Anita because I'd be too afraid of that possible bad review / bad 5 reviews. But you guys know when to draw the line; after all, this is supposed to be a fun business thing and not something that causes great anxiety for anyone.  Has your wife thought of making her own website? If you guys are getting swamped then maybe you have enough business to get off of Etsy and make your own site with your own rules (and thereby not worrying about Etsy making you give a refund, etc.) Or for the time being, offer a $5 off discount for existing customers if they leave a review. Maybe more good reviews will make up for nasty Anita.   Good luck, and screw Anita."
Etsy,38oyhv,AgentFreckles,3,Fri Jun 5 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Once we started getting a lot of business, the idea of starting our own site independent of Etsy was definitely being talked about.  During this down period where most of our listings are deactivated we've done a lot of upgrades in terms of the business process including adjusting pricing, creating a formal customer-requirements-gathering tool, and outsourcing some of our more time-consuming labor tasks.    We are hoping these upgrades will speed along the information gathering, designing, and printing processes for orders so that my wife isn't working 18 hour days and allowing us to take on more orders at a time while maintaining the same profit margin.  We figure if we can get all this up and running before the end of the season then we should have enough money saved up to get a professionally built website by the end of the year.    We are thinking it would be best if we could have our independent site and our Etsy page working in tandem for a while until our marketability is good enough to stand on our own.

The product photos are great, a couple might be a little dark but thats just being picky.  Make use of your favorite listings to highlight your top four.  With the few items you have listed it doubles their appearance on the page.  Biggest concern I would have is that there isn't a unifying theme.  So I am not 100% clear on what the item I am looking at is at first.  Am I buying a picture, or a figure, or a frame with or without this pic or some other item completely?  You got your sections setup which is good. Don't have the answer to make it completely clear.  I don't know if using ""Photo - This photo"" ""Cufflinks - These Lego Cufflinks"" ""Calendar - Bike pics from around"" would work or what effect that would have +/- on your search SEO (most important listing identifiers go first).  just my pennies, hope you are having fun!"

Etsy,38pzn9,Difren,5,Sat Jun 6 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"It's easier to give tips when you have a shop that's already established, since most tips rely on seeing what you're doing vs what you should be doing.  Make sure that you have good policies mapped out when you first open your store. The last thing a brand new store needs is a bad review because someone was expecting something different from what they got, and you refuse to refund them because return policies are not stated in your policies.  Be extra lenient towards your first customers--you need to make an impression, and your first sales are absolutely critical. If you can snag a few reviews because your service was excellent, you'll succeed that much faster.  Make sure what you're offering is unique, or at the very least offered in a unique capacity. You're doing prints, so can you think of something you can do with your shop that sets you apart from others. For instance, if your illustrations mean something to you, make sure you blurb all about their meaning. People love stories to go along with what they are interested in. It makes people feel attached and a part of the art.  I have no other tips beyond that--but I am curious if you have artwork posted somewhere? I'm curious to see what sort of illustrations you'll be selling."
Etsy,38pzn9,Difren,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:16:57 2015 UTC,"I've got a portfolio site, but not much is up for now, I'll definitely PM you within the next week or so :)  Thanks for the tips and such, it gives me a lot to think about!"
Etsy,38pzn9,sirius_moonlight,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:13:15 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I'd love to see what you post when you do! Give you some favorites right off the bat.
Etsy,38pzn9,Christypaints,2,Sat Jun 6 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"If you're sending prints through the mail, figure out exactly how you are going to send them. Meaning what type of envelopes, how much postage will be, etc.  If you're doing downloads, have very good instructions for downloading. Maybe make sure a few less tech friends proof the instructions.  Good luck!"
Etsy,38pzn9,phoebeandjuniper,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I didn't think about that, I'll have to see poster tubes and such at my local post office."
Etsy,38ozcq,shelleybrown05,3,Fri Jun 5 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"Nice shop! I would say to fill out your policies section and maybe write something for your shop announcement.   You don't have a lot of items yet and as you add more, your views and sales should start increasing as well. With my shop, I'm more likely to receive a decent amount of views/sales if I list on a regular basis.  I think your pictures look pretty good. I hear a lot that people prefer all white backgrounds. I use dark gray for some, and white for others. Your necklaces photographed on the stones, may look better on a solid background."
Etsy,38ozcq,trailscrafts,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Thank you! Very good ideas! :D
Etsy,38ozcq,HildasAttic,2,Fri Jun 5 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"Hiya! Your items are lovely! I would agree with /u/trailscrafts about your shop policies. Do you accept returns? Exchanges? Etc.   I'd also suggest adding more variety to your photos. Some of the necklaces look like the photos are zoomed in versions of the first photo, etc. I've started to shoot for at LEAST 5 unique photos (sometimes I go overboard and end up with 30,then narrow it down) and add in a collage as the last photo, but we sell vintage so that may be a bit much for jewelry. As a buyer, I would like to see more angles, and maybe some more detail, especially on the vacuum pieces.   I do not think your prices are too high. Good luck!"
Etsy,38ozcq,iTrollYhu,2,Fri Jun 5 18:22:57 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your advice! :D
Etsy,38oba0,one-jive-turkey,3,Fri Jun 5 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression (though I can't seem to find where I read this) that Etsy limits how many times you show up in a given page, depending on how many results there are for that search. If there's 3 results and they're all you, you'll see them all on one page (but that might not be a good search term!). If there's 140,000 results, you just get one listing on the first few pages. It keeps a single seller from monopolizing the search results."
Etsy,38oba0,boo_hiss,3,Fri Jun 5 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"Your shop's listings are only going to show up once per page... this is a result of etsy's ""de-clumping"" of search results several months ago. It doesn't matter how relevant each of your listings are to the search terms... once per page is it."

Etsy,38oba0,HildasAttic,2,Sat Jun 6 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'm also interested in this! I have two sets of the exact same teacups up, the only difference is one is a set of six while the other is a set of two. The set of two shows on the first page in search while the other doesn't show up."
Etsy,38oba0,phoebeandjuniper,2,Fri Jun 5 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"It's a mix of two things: Etsy does some cloudy things to prevent search results showing as a clump of one seller.  Also, search results are only partially based on your tags and titles. I have a lot of items that are nearly identical in tags and titles but show up pages and pages apart. One of the biggest influencers in search results on Etsy is how people react to your item. For example, if someone searches ""necklace"" and clicks on your item, etsy logs it as being a good fit for that search term. If they favorite it, that's an even bigger impact. And if they buy your item from a search, that's a big indicator to etsy's SEO that your item is a good fit for that search term and they should show it more for that search in the future. I think that's why there are so many teams based on getting views and favorites on items, but they don't really have an impact unless the views came from a search. I hope that helps!"

Etsy,38lq3e,Christypaints,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:21:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really know if they are the best, but I remember doing a lot of research on where convention artists bought their prints and I ended up going with Catprint.com about a year ago. The quality was good and the prices were decent. The main thing I noticed was that the printers did a good job of translating my digital artwork's colors into ink.  I have a new set of artworks that I need to be printed, and I guess I will be using them in the future. The good thing about prints is that they don't go bad, so I'm still using the ones I bulk ordered a year ago."
Etsy,38lf17,DistressedOwl,8,Thu Jun 4 23:44:49 2015 UTC,"I would probably ask her to take it down again and let her know that if she does not comply, you will report her and issue a DMCA with Etsy as the IP holder. It's simple - she agreed to a set of terms and conditions when she bought the item, regardless of whether or not she read them. That set of terms specify that she cannot use it in digital goods such as a printable invitation and she violated the terms. It is unfortunate that the invitations look alike, but I don't think you should remove yours. It's up to you.   As for your current terms of use, I think you should change it to be very explicit. If you are worried about others using your clipart in digital goods, you need to be very explicit. Your current terms do not address this adequately. I assume that this seller thought that since they are printables and the end-product will be a physical invitation, that they are okay to use. I would definitely suggest clarifying your terms."
Etsy,38lf17,swxw,10,Fri Jun 5 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/swxw.    I am so sorry, but in my terms of use in the item description and in the ""readme"" text file inside the download, I specify that any commercial use of the images is for physical items only.   In the future, do not apologize for your terms of service. You always want to send a clear, strong message and apologizing waters it down."
Etsy,38lf17,k80k80k80,4,Fri Jun 5 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with this - I thought you sounded far too apologetic in your initial message, this part especially: ""However I would like to ask you to agree to my terms of use and license by removing the items in your shop using this clipart which are sold as digital products"" is giving her an invitation to say no and fight you on it."
Etsy,38lf17,smallstakes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:15:31 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I was too apologetic. I really was attempting to not come across as attacking her. She wound up telling me I was threatening her anyway. I'm sorta bummed about how it turned out :("
Etsy,38lf17,dewprisms,2,Fri Jun 5 04:40:28 2015 UTC,That is good advice. Thank you. I was trying to sound nice and trying not to make her upset. But in the end she was upset anyway so that backfired.

Etsy,38lf17,bromatologist,3,Fri Jun 5 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the world of being a graphic artist!!  ;)  Seriously, your first DCMA is a baptism by fire; an initiation ritual that all graphic artists must go through to be fully accepted into the tribe.   Some advice:  There's a difference between being needlessly conciliatory (""I'm sooo sorry""), and sufficiently tactful (""allow me to draw your attention to my terms of use, which you may not have been fully aware of."")  Apologies to your infringers are not likely to work in your favor.  Would you apologize to someone who broke into your house to steal your silverware?    I  am sorry this is happening to you. You are on the right side of the law, and it seems like you are taking appropriate steps to manage the situation.  Good luck!"

There are some topics on which we may never reach a consensus as a community, and that is okay. In the words of Joyce Carol Oates, “art should not be comforting; for comfort, we have mass entertainment and one another. Art should provoke, disturb, arouse our emotions, expand our sympathies in directions we may not anticipate and may not even wish.”  As for the cat & dog federal law it mentions: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title19/html/USCODE-2010-title19-chap4-subtitleII-partI-sec1308.htm  looks like it only matters if the item is imported or exported into the US, which is not an Etsy issue, it's a customs issue.

The most she can do is report it if she thinks it's wrong, but a petition seems crazy to me. If it's illegal like she keeps saying, she should talk to law enforcement.

Etsy,38kdq6,etsymyname,5,Thu Jun 4 20:05:50 2015 UTC,I would just use poly mailers. They're less than 25 cents a bag if you buy them in bulk. I would look on Ebay or Amazon for them.
Etsy,38kdq6,sneaky_dragon,4,Thu Jun 4 20:52:20 2015 UTC,If it was completely enclosed it would probably ship fine. The problem would be rolling it in all directions so there were no holes and then the amount of tape you would need to use to close it. So I'm not sure if this would be cheaper in the long run over something like poly mailer bags.  But you can ship in nearly anything that covers your item. I get a lot of ebay shipments that are just taped up broken down brown paper grocery bags taped to hell.  http://www.uline.com/BL_1551/Tear-Proof-Polyethylene-Mailers
Etsy,38kdq6,courtneyj,3,Thu Jun 4 20:10:40 2015 UTC,It would also be a pain in the ass for a customer to unpack. I'd imagine they'd bring out some scissors or a knife to remove all the packing and end up cutting the product.

It's only about the size of a quarter! ---- you mean the exact thing I have it pictured next to for scale?!) and most people don't care.  There are 2 kinds of buyers...those that want your item and those that care enough to care about reviews. Most people just want an item cheaply and quickly and they'll be willing to buy from a 3 star and up shop without a care...the other kind will check your review, see your thoughtful explanation and then probably still buy from you. Don't sweat it."
Etsy,38g15n,courtneyj,7,Thu Jun 4 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"I just got my first 3 star review and it does hurt. Mine was over color. The brown colors were difficult for me to photograph accurately and for all monitors.   My learning experience is to limit/eliminate that color since it is so difficult to photograph.  I've also had people say the glass marbles were smaller than expected, even though they did give it a 5 star review. I also have close-ups of the marbles so they do look much bigger. But I have one shot not so close up with one on the fridge. Still, it is hard to imagine 16 mm without a caliper.   It's tough. I don't respond to reviews that are subjective. That's their feelings . . . whatever. I let the other reviews speak for my shop.  It's nice to have a place here to rant. Etsy Forums get all bent out of shape even if you're on a 'buyer' account.

I do read reviews (I buy a lot of jewelry on Etsy) and when I see the ""smaller than I thought it would be"" or ""nice, but bigger than what I normally like to wear"" I think that buyer was an idiot and don't hold it against the shop at all...."

We are sorry that you are not satisfied with your purchase; however, our item descriptions state the dimensions and sizes of our products (in this case 8mm stones).   The pictures are provided to help portray to our buyers the material as well as the detail on the product and are not the true portrayal of the size.

Etsy,38ekvw,dearwilde,25,Wed Jun 3 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"First off; you should have listed a limit on customer's orders per how much supplies you have. Second, if the customer is asking over your supplies limit, you tell them upfront that you will need to order supplies and it could take longer then expected. Honestly, you told a customer you could get something done without knowing how fast you can get supplies. It's your fault, pay the extra for overnight shipping, and make the customer happy.  If this is impossible due how much negative you will be, call the customer and see what his/her intentions are with the product and see if it can be delayed. You are just starting out (I assume) so this is a great learning situation!"
Etsy,38ekvw,Rambles_Off_Topics,8,Wed Jun 3 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"You gotta think in the long term. Do what you have to do to finish the order. Take the hit now, or run the risk of getting a reputation for not living up to people's expectations. A bad review could be much costlier in the long run.  You can try get shipping refunds from your suppliers to soften the blow.  In the end, as a business, you need to do what you have to for the customer. Assuming you want to take the job seriously, there is really no question of the right path. it's a cost of doing business. it sucks, but covering unexpected problems should be factored into your margins for every sale.  Even if you're just in it as a hobby, think of the community. If you flake out on the customer, they might never shop on etsy again and might talk shit to their friends too, losing future customers for everyone.   Even if no one ever knows, at least you will know you went above and beyond, and made some person in some corner of the world happy, even if it ended up costing you some cash."
Etsy,38ekvw,QuerulousPanda,3,Wed Jun 3 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"I'm panicking over the delayed materials, but in the end I really just want to make my customer happy in whatever way I can! I sent my customer a message explaining the situation, and offered both an overnight shipping upgrade and partial refund for the inconvenience. I also placed another rush order with a different shop for the supplies. If all else fails, I'm prepared to refund the customer the total purchase price (even though I still plan get the order shipped out) and call it a learning experience. I don't want anyone to have a bad experience with my shop, and I'm trying to think of how I would feel most satisfied as a customer if the situation were reversed."
Etsy,38ekvw,happyjoylove,6,Wed Jun 3 19:22:02 2015 UTC,Did you also consider asking the customer if they would accept different colors/patterns that you could ship out now?  Potentially with the offer of a discount...

I was fine to wait longer and declined the refund.. but just the fact that they reached out to me with a solution erased any negative feelings I might have had. It might be different for other people that have a bigger need for the items but I think being honest is the right way to go. Because they were so helpful and honest, I'm already deciding what to order from them next."
Etsy,38ekvw,skunkhaus,2,Wed Jun 3 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that! I was so worried, since I wasn't counting on the shipping delay via the post office, but as the shop, it's my job to count on possible snags like that, so lesson definitely learned! I messaged my buyer, and she sent back a lovely reply saying that she was happy to wait a few extra days, and that a refund wasn't necessary. My plan is to get the order shipped as soon as it's ready (hopefully Friday or Saturday at the latest) and include an extra set of hair ties in a coordinating color as a ""thank you"". I'm breathing a sigh of relief that this situation has worked out okay (and thank you to everyone for the advice and comments!) ♡"

Etsy,38ez58,JessicaAnnsEmporium,4,Fri Jun 5 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"SERIOUSLY? I was just checking out your shop last week, lol. So, it's a small world, haha.  I changed my name about a year after I started as well. It changed my entire business for the better, almost immediately. Before I named it after a blog I created. UGH. I am so happy I changed it. I think you would benefit from a name change, even if it wasn't trademarked.  What I've read both at that time, and now, is a great GREAT tip for your business now and for the future: Try to stay away from putting what you do in your shop name.   Of course, plenty of people do... but I hesitate in telling you to continue with that. What if in half a year your crocheting is selling really well, and something (like the mason jars) aren't doing so hot? You now have a name that is associated with something that isn't your main focus.   Branding and logo identity is a huge business. I would suggest thinking about you and your etsy presence as a whole. What makes you different? Unique?   I can tell you what I did. I am a huge nerd. Disney, books, writing, collecting things, hell I'm even a published author... but most importantly is that both of my shops are nerdy, and well, I tend to geek out hard over things. My shop, JessicaAnnsEmporium, has my name in it - but the logo is a pair of hot pink nerd glasses. I can shift what I sell vintage wise, without compromising my brand. Plus, hot pink glasses - that's something people will remember!  My homemade shop, JessicaAnnDesign - it tells you that I design stuff, whether that's by hand or digitally. My logo there is a bit more creative, but .. it speaks to me. It's my name, and a really tired looking vintage lady. If that isn't me, then I don't know what is.  So, what threads all of your items together? Is it nostalgia for an earlier time? (vhs and records) Make it something  customers can latch on to. Maybe it's just a creative name, but with a logo that pops. But make it YOU. The etsy crowd wants to know your story.   I hope this helps!  Edited because I still suck at formatting on reddit."

Etsy,38ap6t,bigblued,5,Wed Jun 3 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with them, but I know of shops like that. It seems like Zulily, Hautelook, etc. Where they offer a ton of different deals and brands at pretty significant discounts. If you check the site there are things up there from anywhere to 30%-60% off. They require you to do a markdown like that. I've heard of people who dealt with Zulily and didn't have a great experience either.  I think it devalues your work. If you can take such a deep discount no problem, it makes customers think you overcharge. It also makes people wait for you to show up on sales there instead of buying from you at full price. At least that's my experience with Hautelook.  Sorry if this came off as really jumbled. Just wanting to give some input."
Etsy,38ap6t,araradia,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:20:16 2015 UTC,I saw conflicting info about the discount thing when I did a quick skim of the internet about them.  I told him that he will need to study their policies carefully so we don't get taken.

Etsy,388mku,brettievedder,5,Tue Jun 2 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"It says it's carved out of a piece of silver. This is easy to do if you have a mill, or other jeweler's cnc machinery. Like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j3obqlCJ7k or for a real handmade version like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJwKShKZTSw  Here's the exact item from what looks like a chinese reseller https://www.etsy.com/listing/180140392/handwriting-necklace-signature-necklace  That sort of effect could be made through lost wax casting if that's what your wife was thinking of, but doing words in script would be hard unless it was very large. Lost wax casting is using a wax version of the item to present the item in a mold where the wax is melted away when hot metal is poured in and the metal will replace the wax."

Etsy,388e90,domugo,7,Tue Jun 2 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I ship without tracking. I live in Canada and the extra cost to include a tracking number is not worth it. My items are lower cost, so I would rather risk having to give a refund than hike up shipping costs and risk less sales."
Etsy,388e90,visitations,2,Tue Jun 2 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"God bless Canada Post - making shipping costs insane since the dawn of time :)  I'm the same - I can add tracking and/or use a faster service if the customer wants it and is willing to pay for it. Otherwise, it's just not worth it for me.   If I was shipping one-of-a-kind, expensive items I would use it though!"
Etsy,388e90,randomlygen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:06:39 2015 UTC,Also Canadian here. If I use tracking that almost doubles the shipping cost going to US. Crazy! My items are also fairly cheap so not worth it
Etsy,388e90,NellijaG,4,Wed Jun 3 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"Nope. Tracking numbers are what get you out of trouble with Etsy and Paypal if an item delivers but the buyer says they did not. However it sounds like you might not be in the US? In the US the cost for tracking is pretty trivial most of the time, and all labels bought through etsy.com come with tracking for us so they've made it hardly a concern to use it.  Sometimes customs numbers will show up from system to system, but they can't be relied on.  Are you sure the price is too much for your clients? I've found that people seem to care less about the shipping cost than the cost of the item and if they want something, they'll pay for it. Unfortunately without tracking everyone could claim their item didn't arrive and Etsy and/or would hold you responsible for each one."
Etsy,388e90,courtneyj,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm from Europe. I sell most of my items to the US, but 2x for the shipping would be way too much most of the clients. Even now sometimes people ask if I could lower my shipping prices. I've also had some issues with Paypal and Etsy and tracking number helped me.   I'm selling t-shirts and similar stuff. Can you advise me how high can I go with the shipping prices if most of my items are $15-24. Thanks."
Etsy,388e90,Teawouldbelovely,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:24:07 2015 UTC,"HALF your packages are not arriving? Or they're not arriving within a week or two which is what most customers expect. I would have them wait it out.  I don't particularly like making customers wait, but doing that EVERY international order I've ever shipped has arrived eventually and I've shipped just about everywhere.  Brazil, Russia, Malaysia, South Africa etc.   I know the US having a good postal system is part of my success, but obviously the countries on the other end have to do their jobs too.  So a 50% failure rate seems high to me for just about anywhere.  You might see if DHL or another carrier is a better option if your local country/city/state post office is bad because if they're really not arriving, it's probably your local or countries post office system is the problem.  I'm batting 1000 out of 1000 international packages delivered with the exception of 3 or so that have been returned to me. None outright lost."
Etsy,388e90,muffinseatfood,3,Wed Jun 3 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"I always ship without tracking and have never had a problem. And anytime I try and get tracking for international orders, they say that its not available. My cost of items are low so it would be fairly easy for me to refund. So far, a package has never been lost. However, if you are shipping 300 orders a month then I would certainly always use tracking from now on. That's too much to keep track of."
Etsy,388e90,knotty_one,2,Tue Jun 2 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada, and I have shipped over 700 items without tracking. I have sent items all over the world, with a few different methods,all with Canada Post. I have had one get lost - I don't remember exactly where it was but it was far and the customer was not surprised as the mail system there was bad - and less than 10 overall either sent back or lost. I sell jewelry items ranging from 12-100$ and I will continue to ship this way!"
Etsy,388e90,Christypaints,2,Wed Jun 3 02:27:41 2015 UTC,"I do to friends but not with people I don't know personally. Just sort of a trust issue I think. It's worth a little extra money to feel confident in the shipping process, I think."
Etsy,388e90,kezzaroo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"I send without tracking as most of my items are fairly low value and paying for tracked postage would be almost ridiculous, I just ask for a proof of post when I send them out - you would be surprised how many people who 'didn't receive their item' change their minds when you send them proof of postage (and it's no extra cost)"
Etsy,388e90,smallstakes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"I don't have it by default, but I have an option for buyers to upgrade postage to include it if they want. I'm in Australia and the cost of including it isn't worth it."
Etsy,388e90,ussrvintage,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"I am shipping only with tracking code. Sometimes packages get lost and I can find them, or I can get compensation from the post office. I'm thinking it's worth. I am from Lithuania"
Etsy,388e90,hebejebez,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:12:56 2015 UTC,Domestic package post here comes with tracking included in the cost anyway but internationally it's $6 extra which I do charge  but mostly because I believe the shipping time frame is a week shorter than airmail.  Also I have excitable customers who like to parcel stalk.
Etsy,388e90,Teawouldbelovely,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:12:01 2015 UTC,Can you use a site like shipsaver to insure? I pay a $1-2 per package to insure my packages over $100 or so.  Sometimes I ship scarves internationally to developed countries with just an international stamp or two. Not worth it to insure. I pay $1 for them and sell for $20 and I'm not worried about my customers scamming me.
Etsy,388e90,PiranhaPony,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"I don't as I'm in the UK and to add a tracking number would more than double the costs of postage - in fact it would nearly triple it. I offer it as an upgrade option, but not as standard.   So far, I've only had one person request it :P"
Etsy,388e90,LWdkw,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"I ship without tracking. It's €6 to ship without, or €16 to ship with tracking, for a €16 product. Even if I lost half my packages (or half my customers lied about receiving it), it would still be cheaper to just replace the lost products. You just have to figure out a cost effective way, and keep in mind the service your customers expect. That being said, I've never lost anything.  I find it also depends on the country you're shipping from and to. I once send something to Indonesia where after 8 weeks the buyer politely mentioned it hadn't arrived yet. Ofcourse I immediately offered to resend but they said they were used to long shipping times and thought it would show up. At 12 weeks they let me know it arrived. Tracking wouldn't have made a difference.  Tracking doesn't make a difference in if a package can get lost - it's just easier to find it in case anything does get lost."
Etsy,388e90,madxstitcher,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"Goodness, seeing everyone saying that adding tracking would double or treble their shipping costs is staggering. It's such a trivial cost here in the US, and if you ship flat rate, the tracking is even included. I never ship without tracking, because it is a handy weapon to have if someone claims to have not received their item."
Etsy,387dzz,GagLV,3,Tue Jun 2 11:29:19 2015 UTC,I believe the receipt/invoice prints with your shop name and email address.  So perhaps take that into consideration when naming your shop.  Hope that helps.  :)
Etsy,387dzz,myjenaissance,3,Tue Jun 2 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there is a business account per se but, depending on the size of your business, you will need to ""declare"" that your shop consists of multiple people and/or that you have multiple people participating in the item creation process.    and yes, like /u/myjenaissance said, when you print the order receipt it does display your shop name and email address so if you have a email with your business name you should use that when setting up your account."
Etsy,387dzz,littletinypiranha,2,Tue Jun 2 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"Etsy has selling accounts. You are required to enter a bank account to get your regular etsy account be a selling account now I believe. When I opened my second shop it required the bank account. There is also an area where you can enter your tax ID or SSN# and they report your sales directly to the IRS if they are over a certain threshold.  All other business legality is on you. You name your shop what you want, your set your business location what you want, you set up your sales tax how you want, you set the policies you want BUT you're responsible for the legality of all of this. Etsy will not help you out or really provide you anything useful for your own taxes or they won't help you connect with the business and sales tax laws of your own state, etc.   as for the invoice printing your shop name will be attached to it but Etsy now lets you customize these options. Here's the options you get when you click Print Receipt on an order:  http://imgur.com/a/5tUp3"

Coloring pages are great for grandmas, for people in hospital or recovering from ilness at home, for stresss relief and for meditation. I started coloring while listening to music to unwind after workouts, and before long I got waves of inspiration to make my own pages, and here I am, cranking 'em out like nobody's business. I got my intense art-making bug in March and opened up shop in April. I just released my second mandala coloring book, Vajra Mandalas.  For now, Candy Hippie is all instant download printables, but I'll be selling hard-copy printed pages for snail-mailing within the next few months.   The Candy Hippie Facebook page is kinda deserted, I'd love you to follow that for updates. I also have a Twitter and a DeviantArt gallery. And because coloring and music are inseparable for me, I've got a blog at SongMeanings. I also do Pinterest. And I just got myself a tumblr account.   As a thank-you for reading this far, here is a free mandala coloring page for you to print and try out. This is exactly the quality and file type you'll get when you order from Candy Hippie, with one difference: purchased pages don't have a link or any other kind of signature in the corner.

Etsy,3858hw,OceanSiren,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:07:53 2015 UTC,"If you can fit it in a letter size envelope, you can ship international for $1.15.  Go to your local post office and pick up a sheet of international forever stamps.  IIRC, a 6x9 envelope costs $2.26, but double check.  9x12 envelope is $4-something and a Legal size envelope is $6-something."
Etsy,3858hw,bigblued,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:10:57 2015 UTC,The price is now $1.20 as of yesterday for first class letter mail.
Etsy,3858hw,IncrediblyEasy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"hmmm.. but the problem is my signs and decals need to stay rigid and as far as I understand, rigid letter envelopes are considered parcels?"
Etsy,3858hw,awkwardsoul,2,Tue Jun 2 05:05:23 2015 UTC,"Rigid items are parcels, yes.  The price increase is because rigid items can't go through the automated sorting machines and have to be hand processed.   But there is a magical place between rigid enough to protect your decals, and flexible enough to go through the machines.  Also, decals will take some gentle bending without any problems, it's just hard creasing you have to worry about.  I use cardstock myself.  It's cheap, it feels like a greeting card to anyone handling it, and it also keeps the mailing weight down.  Think about all the mail you get.  Are any of your letter size pieces of mail ever folded in half?  How about any greeting cards?  Are they ever folded in half?  The answer is probably no, or very rarely.  I have only ever had one person tell me that their decal was bent by their postal carrier.  I sent them another, and it was fine the second time."

What I would like to see is how many queries per day are there in the various categories.  For instance, I sell crochet items and I have about 50 views a day -- I think this sucks.

Etsy,3833k8,sandusky-s,3,Mon Jun 1 14:38:50 2015 UTC,Flat rate boxes are usually the way to go.
Etsy,3833k8,giantslor,2,Mon Jun 1 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"I would say that flat out eating the shipping price is not a good idea. If you wanted to ""move"" some of that amount to your product price, that's up to you but remember that you'd have to pay Etsy fees on that.   It would be helpful if you could mention what the actual amount it is that you're seeing with your searches. It's hard to tell if what you're seeing is too high or if other people are setting it too low (or just different shipping method altogether) if we don't know what the actual price is."
Etsy,3833k8,littletinypiranha,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:14:31 2015 UTC,I'm getting over  $15 for the standard shipping price usps.com
Etsy,3833k8,OceanSiren,2,Mon Jun 1 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"If you mail your package at the post office, it will cost you retail price. For packages 2.1 lbs to 3 lbs, it will cost $15.50 retail, and $13.52 if you buy the postage online via Paypal, the USPS site, or on Etsy.   Priority mail would only cost a little (few cents) more than Standard post, (I don't think they call it that anymore) but your customers will definitely appreciate paying a few cents more to get their packages much sooner than 7-8 business days.  I only have the Priority rates from 1 - 4 lbs, but they are:    1.1 lbs - 2 lbs costs $11.55 retail and $9.97 commercial 2.1 lbs - 3 lbs costs $15.50 retail and $13.52 commercial  3.1 lbs - 4 lbs costs $18.65 retail and $16.28 commercial"
Etsy,3833k8,HildasAttic,2,Mon Jun 1 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"We just opened a few weeks ago (2.5 I think), and sent our first order Sat. I think it really depends on what you're shipping. A lot of what we sell (actually, everything we sell currently) is fragile, so our boxes are heavy, and big. Shipping is expensive.   I Noticed when I made ""parcel select"" an option it brought the price down a TON,  but it's still expensive for some things. But, like someone said to me in the post I posted here last week, if they want it, they'll pay the shipping.   Here is that post if you want to look through it. I felt like a lot of the answers I got were very helpful."
Etsy,3833k8,MichMaybenot,2,Mon Jun 1 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Without knowing the size of what you're shipping, it will be hard to help - so much of the pricing depends on the size/shape of the packaging!"

I charge my customers about £20 ($30) and it costs me £25-30 to ship the items internationally. I don't feel I can charge more than £20 though. I always send tracked - both for my own protection and there's - ""oh i didn't receive my item"" etc.  I'm in the UK so I don't know if it's relevant but business rates at my local post office are a tad better - but not hugely. I just generally shop around for cheapest couriers - or if USA use UPS."
Etsy,3833k8,Baby_B,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:27:49 2015 UTC,"Are you looking at USPS.com? I've never found that site to be very useful. If you're printing labels directly from Etsy based on weight and zip code, then that is very accurate. On a side note, when it comes to shipping supplies, you're usually better off buying materials from a grocery or office supply store. Unless you're shipping priority than you can get free boxes through USPS."

I have a wedding sign download shop and I do use fonts and graphics I buy online but I try to make something unique that no one else has. Of course I make like $14 a month so there ya go lol.   I think you should do both too. I was so much happier making collage art cards but when the wedding stuff took over, it was hard to turn down money!  My printed wedding shop is a beast and I get burnt out. I have a jewelry shop and a seasonal decor shop that don't make hardly any money but they provide me with a ""hobby"" that is also income potential.

I wouldn't look at it that way. You need to invest time to make money somehow, so if you didn't have a printable shop you'd probably be working a regular job right?  I'm not terribly keen on packing orders but the upside is I can stick on Netflix and stay in my pajamas, chill out and work away. You also have a lot more flexibility with time than a regular job so even if you don't particularly enjoy the work there's lots of upsides I think, I think being your own boss is awesome as well!  Very few people are going to be able to make a living doing something fulfilling and profitable, I'd do the things you actually enjoy doing in your hobby time, stick it up on Etsy some time and see how it goes"
Etsy,380x2d,bonny_k,2,Tue Jun 2 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out to you in so many ways, but I want to, on no uncertain terms, reaffirm you through this period of self doubt, and encourage you to grow in love for your own talent.  Art is art, regardless of the medium.  You, being a working artist who makes money is so incredibly impressive, regardless of whether you're a digital artist or a watercolorist.  The fact that you're making money and able to market yourself means that people love what you do.  You're making something that feeds their souls.  You may not understand it, but that is truly what is happening.  At the same time, you have to feed your own soul.  If you find gratification through watercolor, then by all means pursue that as well.  But don't fall into the misapprehension that it has to be one or the other.  It can, and should, be both.  You need to put food on the table, and you need food for your soul.  Here's a link to an article I think you will find very reaffirming.  It's about ""impostor syndrome,"" which affects all working artists, and seems to be hitting you particularly hard right now.  http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/07/glenn-kurtz-practicing/  I should also mention, despite your own obvious self-doubt, your post has inspired me to consider working on printables.  In addition to being a fine artist (large abstract canvases that I don't try to sell on Etsy), I've been a graphic artist for many years (web media).  And, frankly, reading your post, occurred to me that my talents could be put to better and more creatively truthful use through printables.  It's an interesting new way to hone my art into a new field.  At the very least, it would be nice to one day stop just making 100 different kinds of social media icons and get into something that has comparatively more opportunity for creative...truth?  Originality?    To sum up: 1) you are an artist, not an impostor 2) you still need to feed your soul 3) Despite all your self-doubt and misgivings, you inspired me to find a better outlet for my creativity than redrawing the facebook logo every day. 4) Time to pat yourself on the back.  Also, if you wouldn't mind linking to your shop, I'd be very curious to see it.    edit: I spelled ""frankly"" as ""grankly"""

Etsy,37nl5p,Bryannavasero,5,Thu May 28 23:21:14 2015 UTC,You need to work on your SEO. Your tags are not very good and will not help you be found in search.  The Esty Seller Handbook has a lot of entries on improving tags and SEO.  You also have absolutely no policies and need to get that fully filled out ASAP.  Your products are lovely but you need to get the rest of your shop in line. All the promoting in the world won't help when buyers have no idea about your return policy.
Etsy,37nl5p,araradia,2,Thu May 28 23:31:39 2015 UTC,ouuuuu okay okay! I will look at that :)   Thank you so much!
Etsy,37nl5p,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Thu May 28 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"Basically, fill out anything where you can put text :)  Your shop announcement is empty. That would be a good place to say hello and briefly mention that buyers are looking at a collection of art from various artists.   Also consider changing your shop title. Currently it says ""For Art Nerds, by Art Nerds!"" I believe this title is part of the text that is searched by google, so fill it with keywords (prints, giclee, etc).  And yes, following Araradia's comments- PLEASE fill out policies NOW. Etsy has prompts for what info to put in each section. Be sure to put a note in there that international buyers have to be aware of any taxes or duties incurred for imports so there are no surprises down the road.   I'm happy to see your about page has been filled out!  Also, people like to shop. It's hard to shop if there isn't much to look at. While I commend your efforts to include prints (since having a range in prices is very important), I would say that you still need more items in your shop. More items keeps shoppers lingering longer, and also increases your chances of an item being seen in search because you'll have more stuff that can be searched."

I feel like it made a huge difference in the consistency and professionalism of my listings. I was fairly new then and I was picking up things fairly quickly, I ended up revamped all my descriptions several times and it was a huge time-saver! I probably wouldn't bother with any editing tool unless it had this feature."

Etsy,37muy7,etsymyname,2,Thu May 28 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, wholesalers generally expect to get 50% off your retail prices. Problem is, most of us don't actually charge a retail price. There are plenty of price calculators out there (and it's obviously up to you what your method is) but I think the generally accepted formula is: Materials + Labor + Expenses + Profit = Wholesale   The problem is that we (as artists) usually stop there. We charge wholesale thinking it's retail. If you double that wholesale price, then you get a retail price. If we charge a true retail price to begin with, wholesaling becomes less of a price issue because you're not cutting into profit.   Of course, using that model we sometimes end up calculating over $100 for a little scarf, and we know no one will pay that much. That's sort of the problem with handmade. It's not valued as much so we try to lower our prices to match.  Now that I've gone on a tangent, I want to also mention that I do wholesale my things, but only the items that I charge a true retail price on. Other things that take me more time or cost more in materials, I may charge closer to wholesale on Etsy or at craft shows, but I will never put them in my linesheet because I'd lose money if I offered 50% off.  Also, I don't think there's anything wrong with charging wholesale prices to everyone. As long as you're getting the return you want. But if you want to get into wholesaling, it becomes important to price correctly. Wholesale buyers might not take issue with paying a discounted rate on your items, but you can create price confusion when an item in your Etsy shop is $60 but it's also available elsewhere for $90."
Etsy,37muy7,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Fri May 29 14:55:32 2015 UTC,Most wholesale is 50% off but it can be less or more depending on how your pricing is. You can always increase/decrease the discount depending on how much they buy so you can tell them that too.
Etsy,37muy7,araradia,1 point,Thu May 28 21:51:16 2015 UTC,Ouch 50% is going to kill me. Hmm - guess I should see what type of volume they are looking for! Thanks!
Etsy,37muy7,araradia,1 point,Thu May 28 22:45:45 2015 UTC,You don't have to do 50%. You do what is comfortable for you.
Etsy,37muy7,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Thu May 28 23:28:10 2015 UTC,I've been doing 25% off orders of $300 or more.  Just do the math and make sure you're still making a decent hourly wage for labor.
Etsy,37muy7,figment81,1 point,Thu May 28 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"You are adding something that doesn't matter. If your retail price is $45 Your material costs are $13 (Plus your labor costs let's say $7)  Then your cost to make is $20 leaving you with $25 profit  Shipping does not go into your cost, it is an add on paid by the customer.  True wholesale retail on this item should be retail at $80 wholesale at $40. If you really want to wholesale it may become to get your costs down by buying in bulk or raise your prices to get closer.  Like new retail being $55 Then wholesale you are making $14.50 ( this includes your labor cost and $7.50 profit from selling wholesale)   And your new retail profit would be $41.50"
Etsy,37muy7,shanthology,1 point,Fri May 29 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"COG + Labor X 2 = Wholesale COG + Labor X 4 = Retail   We skew a few of our products where we make a little less because we don't think the market will support the above model and we do want to sell things but we also make sure we are making some profit! It's important that your wholesale pricing is HALF of your retail though, many retailers will pass if they can not double your wholesale price to match your retail, they don't want to be in competition with you on price."
Etsy,37le1j,5bi5,3,Thu May 28 13:53:23 2015 UTC,"I have a Canon SX170 IS, which is a compact super-zoom camera. It has an excellent macro setting, and it just takes great photos.

It had a really nice macro setting which was important for me to photograph jewelry (or any small items). In general, just look for something with good reviews pertaining to the lens quality and that has good image stabilization. That will help keep things clearer if you don't have a tripod (or anything to stabilize the camera)."

Etsy,37le1j,Fus_ro_dah_lady,1 point,Thu May 28 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to spend much on a camera, the other way is to ""improve the environment"" to improve your pictures. When I don't have enough proper lighting to take pictures, my pictures always turn out kind of off colour and funky looking.   If your items are small enough, try googling making a light box out of cardboard and tissue paper. This can dramatically improve the quality of the photos. Definitely use a stable object to help steady your hand (or even a small tripod if you can). For larger items or if you want more exciting backgrounds, natural lighting is the way to go. It really reduces the amount of editing afterwards and just looks so much cleaner than the yellowy indoor lighting feel.   How are you taking your pictures?"
Etsy,37le1j,lambandthimble,1 point,Thu May 28 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"My office has full sunlight in the mornings. Lighting is fine, its just my cheap-ass, ancient camera. In poor lighting it can't take a picture at all. :)  It's also about to break I think.  Pretty sure I found a decent camera in my price range. Sometimes internet shopping sucks. Too many options, too many reviews. What's actually the best? No one knows..."
Etsy,37le1j,TheMothFlock,1 point,Thu May 28 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly anything you get will probably be terrific for what you need it to do. Cameras have come a loooooong way and the notion that a fancy DSLR is infinitely better than a point-and-shoot is no longer applicable. Every year the zoom gets better, and every year the features gets fancier. I'm always impressed at how affordable cameras are now whenever I am browsing around. I think whatever you get in your price range will be great, just do some research and don't stress out too much about it :)  As a graphic artist, I recommend investing some time to learn post-processing of photos and some basic photography tips like ratios. Most people underestimate the ability of post-processing. The right color balance and saturation can make a so-so picture absolutely breathtaking!"

Etsy,37ljv4,thegianttaco,5,Thu May 28 14:37:19 2015 UTC,Make sure your pictures are crisp (but add a watermark!) and titled descriptively and appropriately for what the image is.  Be very clear whether you're selling prints or digital files. Make the shop look cohesive to whatever style you're intending to brand yourself with. Fill out all your shop policies.  Then post shop here for further help? It's hard to give non-vague advice on a potential shop.
Etsy,37ljv4,Christypaints,2,Thu May 28 14:53:26 2015 UTC,thank you for this! Do you know if people will actually buy digital files? Or do actual prints sell better?

Etsy,37ljv4,penguin_thievery,2,Thu May 28 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"Would that include well known buildings in major cities that people would search for?  Photography is a hard market to get into.  Digital photos even more so.  You might have better luck uploading your photos to society6.com (you would need to build a web following and generate traffic to it though) or look into stock photography sites.  With photography on etsy, you need to have something that separates you from all the other shops -whether it's your filters, editing, adding text, sizing.  It is such a saturated market.  There is also a ton of time that goes into it as well and money for supplies, you would need to register as a small business and collect taxes if you are in the USA.  Have you looked into your competition on etsy?"

I sold some books on Amazon a while ago, and lost a lot of money because the buyer of a very expensive textbook claimed I sent the wrong book.  Amazon refunded without requiring an iota of proof.

Etsy,37hoat,dearwilde,8,Wed May 27 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"This person is an order of magnitude under anything that will get you views, much less sales.  People with true reach don't go asking for things to feature, the people who want to be featured go to them.  Instagram seems to convert better at lower numbers so if someone with 2k followers approached you there you should consider it if it's not a financial hardship, but for every other service it's probably not worth your time for anything under 10k views or followers.   At the level they're at now they are working on getting stuff to build THEIR audience, not yours. So I would politely decline and offer 25% off, maybe 50% if they seem genuine. But there's no reason to give away your product to better their position."

In fact, seeking to promote my Etsy app through blogs is a really powerful channel for marketing, and I am very enthusiastic about it.

I'd say, politely pass on this offer but keep your eye out for other bloggers with more networking power."
Etsy,37hoat,skunkhaus,2,Thu May 28 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"I've learned to say no, politely.   If you think the value in their service equals the value of the item (plus shipping) that you would provide, then go for it. Call it an even trade. But with a low viewership and small following, it looks like you'd just be on the losing end."
Etsy,37hoat,CircuitBreakerLabs,2,Wed May 27 20:58:47 2015 UTC,I either totally ignore people or I offer a discount to them and their viewers.  Normally they never respond because they just want free items lol.  And their viewers/subscribers is absolute peanuts.
Etsy,37hoat,araradia,2,Wed May 27 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"I sent a Youtuber some items to do a review on. She made a great video on it and I got a lot of attention, and I was only out $20 including priority shipping. This has created a really powerful backlink too, which I do see the impacts of and feel it was overall worth it. I think it's even more powerful now that the impact of Youtube videos has gone up in relation to SEO, since Google bought YT.   She also had 20k followers and got 2k views per video - which was the bigger reason why.  I think it might be worth it for you in the future if they have a lot of views / followers. What a lot of people fail to realize is that it's a mutual agreement and (provided they have a lot of followers) you're essentially using your items to pay for publicity. This is NOT a bad thing and NOT undervaluing yourself (as long as you're not sending them super expensive things, I think your clips and the likes would be fine). It's also the same with bloggers and some editorial magazines. I watched a long session on CreativeLive about this recently.   For now I'd just give them a coupon code and be on my way. Since you're not making enough money to send her any product, which is fine. But in the future I'd gauge their following on how much I spent on my bows/floral clips etc and compare value vs reward potential.   I do think you should expand on your listings first.

I did send her a response, and offered a coupon code for 20% any order through my shop, and said that if she did choose to feature my items that I would be okay with it.  I'm not opposed to being featured on YouTube at all, but I agree with the general consensus that subscriber/view numbers absolutely make a difference in swaying my decision! In this particular case, I tried to make a compromise where both parties could hopefully benefit, since her channel is new and so is my shop. :)  And thank you for the compliment! I'm currently working on colorful sets of resin flower clips and magnets, and I'm planning to have them listed in my shop this weekend. :)"

Etsy,37hqf3,FormSpaced,1 point,Fri May 29 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"Do not use minimalism unless it fits your brand. It fits mine, so I use plain white. Perhaps limiting the variety in backgrounds and lighting will help? I would take photographs on a cloudy day so that the lighting isn't so harsh. I would also triple the amount of items listed in your shop.   Also, put something in your shop announcement. Even just a hello and a link to your instagram would be good. Also, you're allotted a certain # of characters under your shop name (called the shop title). Instead of repeating your shop title, put keywords in there to bump up your SEO.   Your descriptions need more beef. Are those kimonos one size fits all? Would it really fit all? Do these things cover tall women (I hate robes that don't cover my butt).   Also, beef up your keywords. You can use up to 20 characters for each (I think) so instead of putting beach and coverup separately, you can combine those (since they go together) and free up some space for more tags. If you can't think of any, use google to help (start a search for kimono and see what it autofills). There's also a keywork app thing through google but I can't remember what it's called.  Fill our your about page more. Etsy is about individual makers (or so it used to be) and a lot of shoppers like to read about the people behind the products. Make your personality shine through.  If you want more traffic from within Etsy and you don't want to use promoted listings, you'll have to list and/or renew multiple times a day. I think it's better to list than renew (because more things to choose from is better). Plus having fresh listings should (or last I knew) bump up your relevancy in search. You could also try doing treasuries. Some people swear by them, but I think they're not prestigious like they used to be (when there was only a max of 300, and you had to wait by the computer to snipe a slot when one expired). Anyway, making treasuries posts on the etsy dashboard thing, so people who follow you will see it.   Looks like you're off to a great start! It takes a lot of tweaking and reworking to get things rolling."
Etsy,37hqf3,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Wed May 27 21:26:02 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I really like your stuff!   Here are some things I noticed and some things that have helped me get more sales. First, I agree that the background is too busy. I would say stand against something like a concrete/brick/stucco wall. That way it's not just a boring white background but isn't too busy either. Here's a shop that uses both types of backgrounds - you can see in the ones with the stucco/concrete that the clothing stands out much more.   Also, when you're taking photos you have to think about your thumbnail image on Etsy. You want to make sure that the shots you're taking will include the whole piece without it being cut off. The extra photos are meant to show the detail. This shop has pretty good thumbnail images of Kimonos. I think the 'Pink Geometric' and 'Cross Beach' on your shop are perfectly in frame for the thumbnail.   The second thing I noticed were your titles. Add more keywords to them. On my shop I used to just put things like ""Pink Brontosaurus Planter with Air Plant"" and I've since learned that that wasn't enough. Now it says ""Pastel Pink Brontosaurus Dinosaur Planter with Air Plant; Dinosaur Planter; Dino; Brontosaurus; Air Plant; Tillandsia."" Adding more keywords into my titles have gotten me substantially more views! So maybe instead of ""Pink Geometric Kimono"" you can say something like ""Pink Geometric Kimono; Women's Clothing; Trendy Fashion; Kimono; Bohemian; Boho Fashion; Fashion Kimono."" You also want to put at least the first part of your title as the first part of your description. So it would start off with:   ""Pink Geometric Kimono - Lightweight hand crafted kimono style shawl/jacket with pink, red, and beige geometic design. Perfect for the beach or over a tank. Made in the USA.  Handwash Only. 100% Rayon Challis""   I would also add in dimensions to your descriptions. People like to have measurements when they're buying clothing online.   I would also finish your about this shop page. Add in why you started doing it, why you love doing it and why it means so much to you. You want people to fall in love with your personality and the clothing!"
Etsy,37f1pp,LucaC,1 point,Wed May 27 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"There are a whole lot of if's and maybe's in this article. I checked out Scoutmob and it is in no way up to Etsy in terms of what is offered. Seems like more of a PR piece for Scoutmob because the upshot is ...  ""The Bottom Line: Here’s What We Know About Selling Handmade Goods on Handmade at Amazon with Scoutmob   Etsy sellers have been receiving e-mails from Amazon with a link to an online form to request additional information on the selling program. Scoutmob has not contacted Etsy sellers about selling through Amazon. Scoutmob currently has an Amazon channel where their active makers were given the opportunity to participate. Handmade at Amazon does not have a release date. Handmade at Amazon has not released information on categories, listing fees, commission fees, or terms of service, as of the publication of this article. If you want to sell handmade goods through Amazon, you may open a shop as a seller direct through Amazon or submit your wares to Scoutmob for curation and if accepted, inquire on being included through their Scoutmob channel."""
Etsy,37f1pp,shillyshally,1 point,Wed May 27 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"This is NOT a PR piece for Scoutmob. I am not a Scoutmob seller, nor am I an affiliate of Scoutmob.   There are a whole lot of if's and maybe's in the article because Amazon made big moves in soft-announcing a dedicated Handmade Marketplace on the Amazon channel without providing the handmade community any information on WHEN it is launching, HOW it is launching, and what fees will be associated with utilizing this channel.  Scoutmob's name got tossed in the ring because their sellers were invited to participate in Scoutmob's Amazon channel, that may end up being a part of this ""Handmade at Amazon"" concept that has yet to be finalized.  I am a part of no less than 25 online forums for online retailers of handmade arts. There are a lot of rumors and misconceptions about the Handmade at Amazon marketplace and Scoutmob's involvement, which is why I took the iniative to contact these companies directly to get more information.  This article details the information that I was provided regarding Scoutmob and their rumored partnership with Handmade at Amazon. Because even their involvement on this new platform is up in the air, there are still many questions about what Amazon is building to directly compete with Etsy.  Amazon has not gotten back to me for comment."
Etsy,37f1pp,courtneyj,1 point,Wed May 27 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen sellers from Etsy, Scoutmob and basically any place where more than a few sellers have collected have been contacted with the survey form to sell."
Etsy,37cyxs,shillyshally,10,Tue May 26 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"Etsy has marketed itself pretty dishonestly. I think a lot of buyers and sellers are ready to jump ship. Etsy has lost so much consumer confidence by allowing resellers, charm n' chain shops, and blatant copyright violators to take over. Etsy is the Time Warner Cable of online craft selling platforms, as soon as an alternative is made available, everyone will embrace it. Verizon (not exactly a warm and fuzzy corporation itself) would have to get all of their employees to eat a basket full of live puppies in front of me to get me to go back to TWC. My feelings about Etsy are not quite as strong. Most other platforms currently available either have no significant traffic, or require too much time for hobbyists or beginners.   When I log into Etsy, my feed is mostly high-quality, handmade items. However, when a new or infrequent buyer visits Etsy to find something via search or browse, they are met with tons of resellers. So many people I know complain about how you have to wade though 89375782 pages of massively overpriced factory-made trash to find something authentic. The high volume of trash is exactly where Etsy's money comes from, people who can list and sell hundreds of items a week. Etsy betrayed its customer base. now its paying the price. Many buyers have paid for what they thought was a handmade item, and received something that looked like it was on sale at the dollar store. To make all that fast money, Etsy made itself synonymous with cheap, imported, cutsy shiz. I think Amazon might be seen as more trustworthy. They already sell the AliBaba crap just as is...if they have some way of keeping it out of the handmade marketplace, it'll already be a better place to shop than Etsy. If I wouldn't have to compete with resellers...it might be better as a seller too...depending on fees. Amazon has a reputation for decent customer service. Etsy's idea of ""customer service"" (at least for sellers) seems to consist of the silent treatment and banning people from the forums."
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,4,Tue May 26 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"I have been buying - not selling - on Etsy for years and this has not been my experience. I buy mostly  vintage items for the home and some vintage apparel but collect from a couple of ceramics makers (one who left for a while, fed up as a seller but now she is back).  I have had good experiences. I bookmark search terms so I don't have to weed through crap every time I am looking for something in particular. I go through phases. Right now I am in Vintage Brass Animals phase. So, I don't see all the crap you mention but yes, as an investor who HAD been thinking of picking up a few shares, I have seen the complaints.  I am on the fence. I don't know if Amazon can repeat the experience. Granted, their home page is not as dreadful as it used to be. If Homemade is graphically more like MyHabit, that would be good (just thought of that). OTOH, they could crush Etsy and then raise prices to the sellers.  You make an excellent point about Amazon's customer service. I am a Prime member and have never been disappointed with their treatment. My Fire stopped charging and the support person asked if I had the latest charger (it is from 2013 - ancient) and I said no but I would like them to send it to me no charge and they did."
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,2,Tue May 26 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been my experience as a buyer either, but I've been using the site for years.   A new buyer might go to Etsy specifically because Etsy markets itself as a place to find, if not handmade or authentic vintage, at least high-quality, unique, goods made by small, ethical manufacturers. Then they might type in a search term expecting all of these items they ""can't find anywhere else,"" and see the same items, listed by 4 different sellers for under $15 on the front page. That doesn't inspire consumer confidence. Type in something like ""silver heart necklace"" and it looks like 50% of the listings are the same necklace, with a few Tiffany knockoffs. People shouldn't have to shift through piles of garbage to find something authentic.   I never really looked at MyHabit, but that looks much nicer than regular Amazon. I'd imagine they know that if they're going to take over Etsy's customer base, they have to look the part. I'm a little worried as a seller. I'd want to know not only about fees, but what kinds of policies/standards they would have for photography, shipping, quantity of each item (min? max??), one-of-a-kind and custom items, etc. What about the really weird stuff? That's one of my favorite things about Etsy."
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,2,Wed May 27 00:56:07 2015 UTC,"Those are interesting questions.   MyHabit has a great UI. I have bought some things from them but basically they are the same as onekingslane. The whole flash sale thing has morphed into fake 'sales'.   For instance, I mentioned I am collecting vintage brass animals. Something that sells on Etsy for $25 will be priced at least twice that and usually thrice that on onekingslane and then that is supposed to be the 'sale' price with the original price being even more absurd.   I keep going back and forth with each seller response, thinking Amazon could be better and then maybe Amazon would devolve into selling the same mass produced items Etsy is now accused of selling.   I do truly wish that SOME PLACE would be successful at selling high quality, affordable crafts from around the world."
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,1 point,Wed May 27 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"What I'd hope for is that Amazon would just switch accounts of resellers from the handmade marketplace to regular Amazon. Or at least shut down shops that are reported for violating ToS.   Me too. I use Etsy all the time. It's the first place I go to find gifts. I like buying really unique items as gifts, and supporting independent artists around the world. I hope something like this can exist, but it needs to exist in a balance."
Etsy,37cyxs,Shekh_ma_shieraki_an,4,Wed May 27 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"You mean so like the handmade sellers would be in with the TVs and shoes? I was kind of envisioning more of a separate, nicer UI of its own down there at the bottom of the home page with the other specialty stores."
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,3,Wed May 27 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"We're on the same page. I was just thinking that if a seller on the handmade marketplace is caught reselling factory made items, then they could be  reclassified with the distributors of TVs and value packs of socks."
Etsy,37cyxs,giantslor,2,Wed May 27 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, totally agree!"
Etsy,37cyxs,giantslor,1 point,Wed May 27 16:43:16 2015 UTC,I completely agree. My feed is also high quality handmade items that I am interested in but when I look for something new I am reminded that tons of products on there are terribly made garbage. I recently wanted a vintage high waist bathing suit and the majority of sellers were claiming their items to be handmade when they were absolutely not. These sellers didn't even take the time to shoot new photos but used the exact same ones from the sites they bought them from and at a significantly lower price.   I shop Etsy pretty frequently and have had a total of 2 sellers completely blow me off and never ship my product. Etsy's customer service was terrible about it both times.
Etsy,37cyxs,poxteeth,3,Wed May 27 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"I love my feed so much. It's more aspirational than practical. This is what my life would look like if I were not a broke-ass slob.   I'd bet $100k and one of my fingers that someone on Etsy is selling this for $60+ and claiming its handmade or vintage. These people are liars. Ugh. When Target sells that shit at least they don't claim it was made in sun-dappled clearing by a bunch of soft-spoken anthropology majors assisted by  a menagerie of woodland creatures.   I've never had a really bad interaction with an Etsy seller. I have heard that the way Etsy handles this is to tell the buyer to ""take it up with the seller"" who won't respond if they were a scammer all along."
Etsy,37cyxs,giantslor,3,Wed May 27 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like amazon will be a good option for sellers who can provide a pallet of handmade items to amazon for distribution, and who also can absorb the cost of free shipping. Lots of people use amazon for the free immediate shipping with their prime account.  For small scale handmade sellers and definitely for vintage sellers, I feel like ebay is by far their best value for the money. It has the online flea market feel but there are so many more potential customers there it's not even funny. Let's face it, a good amount of etsy sellers are selling kitschy, silly items that fall directly in line with ebay.  And the best part with ebay is that ebay actually helps you with the exploitable things that get you traffic like search terms, shipping options, number of items in your shop, promotions, etc."
Etsy,37cyxs,iheartgin,1 point,Tue May 26 23:45:00 2015 UTC,That is interesting from the seller point of view. I rarely use eBay anymore as the interface just bugs the hell out of me aesthetically (graphics arts background). I do know that many people post on both places.  I have not seen anything about free shipping re the Amazon venture. That would be huge.   I was leaning towards this not being a viable avenue for Amazon when I first read about it last week but the comments here are changing my mind.
Etsy,37cyxs,fuckinintents,2,Wed May 27 00:45:08 2015 UTC,"I rarely use eBay anymore as the interface just bugs the hell out of me aesthetically (graphics arts background).   Yup and I feel like that hurts a lot of people who want to be focused on sales but want to sell to that more upscale contingent. That was me for the last couple of years. Now I think that upscale contingent is just a myth.  If you think about it, the people who want to reduce waste, move beyond the outdated wholesale-distributor-retail chain, find unique things, preserve worthwhile items, etc... they shop more on ebay. It is the originator of all of this stuff. They designed the system- fifteen years ago ebay was operating before people even had digital cameras or a way to send money over the internet.  I feel like etsy is this thing that was initially fueled by the positivity around its DIY aesthetic. Now it's this company made up of these people with art degrees and Macklemore haircuts making these strategic moves that etsy has no business making.  They've made a serious bid to compete with amazon and now amazon is going to take away their revenue stream and eventually absorb them."

Etsy,37eaw8,someoneinwyoming,4,Wed May 27 00:19:27 2015 UTC,Maybe if you can make more knit summer wear like hairbands and bows? I don't think hot summer is the best time to sell scarves and gloves.
Etsy,37eaw8,sneaky_dragon,2,Wed May 27 03:07:33 2015 UTC,Unless they are deeply discounted. I always look at winter clothing in the summer on the off chance that it'll be cheaper.
Etsy,37eaw8,Christypaints,1 point,Thu May 28 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think the baby items would still work, maybe try using cotton yarn instead which give it a more summer-knit-item type of feel? Lighter weight scarves and shawls may still work. I think you should pass on the fingerless gloves tho.   The headbands and bows idea is good. Maybe try to see if you can think of anything else that would be suitable? Even small knit dolls/stuffed animals could be cute. You could do some that would match the rodeo theme. I don't know how much it would cost you as a vendor but if it's relatively cheap, it may be a good experience if you haven't done a lot of shows."
Etsy,37eaw8,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed May 27 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"I do tons of shows, and I do about 80% of them between September and December.   I do believe scarves, even if they're light, will be a tough sell in summer. However, what is your reasoning for doing the show? If you're looking to try it out and get feedback from customers, it may work out just fine. But if you're looking to bring in a lot of sales, this time of year may not be the best for you.  Also consider what the show is. If it's mostly for rodeo-goers and foodies, you'll be hard pressed to find people who actually want to purchase handmade items. Also, I find it tougher to sell higher priced or specialty items in summer since people aren't yet shopping for gifts, or don't intend to purchase anyway."
Etsy,37eaw8,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Wed May 27 21:13:41 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on the cost of the booth.

I stayed in a specific niche since that's what I'm most knowledgeable about and it's not too saturated on etsy."
Etsy,37epli,sneaky_dragon,3,Wed May 27 02:40:14 2015 UTC,My advice for you is to sell what you love making
Etsy,37epli,orangebanananaapples,2,Wed May 27 12:35:21 2015 UTC,I studied graphic design at university but didn't want to work for a company creating things I wasn't passionate about. I started my Etsy shop so I could create and sell exactly what I want to.  I work in IT full time so it is essential to me that I keep designing in my spare time!
Etsy,37epli,LordHoneyBadger,2,Wed May 27 07:00:37 2015 UTC,It was pretty easy for me. I loved to paint and I saw other artists that had become really successsful on Etsy. So that's how/ when I decided to open up a shop. I've been experimenting with my style ever since :)
Etsy,37epli,ihaveacutepuppy,2,Wed May 27 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"I work with the live versions of what I sell, saw that there was a market for their by-products, thought I'd give it a shot, was pleasantly surprised that it has worked out really well for me."
Etsy,37epli,savannahrhayne,2,Wed May 27 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with other posts here-  I was already making jewelry, made too much, and turned to Etsy as a way to sell some off and raise capital to purchase more supplies.   My shop started with beadwork, and has now shifted to circuit board jewelry because it is niche enough and ruled back when geekery was a category. My style has morphed over the years with several major rebrandings. Products I make now are restricted to being made with circuit board (to keep the brand cohesive). If I ever decide I want to start selling a different type of item, I will open a different shop. BUT I wouldn't open a shop and then make stuff to go in it. I would make a bunch of things, develop a line, maybe take it to a craft show to get some feedback, then figure out what the brand is, and create a shop that works for that brand.   Unfortunately, I think Etsy shops work better when they're cohesive. I make beaded and other resin jewelry, and I find even at craft shows, that people are rarely drawn to multiple types of jewelry, so separating them helps make a stronger brand. Otherwise your shop will be incredibly confusing to buyers."

All of the items I sell started out as personal projects and gifts for others. So I basically turned my passion into a business. I love it.
Etsy,37bzao,givememyaccountback,5,Tue May 26 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"Whether or not you want to issue refunds/exchanges is entirely up to you, as long as you make it clear in your shop policies what you do/do not accept. However, (I am not a lawyer), I feel like there must be some sort of rule/law where the policies can't be unreasonably disadvantageous to the customer. For example, if you as a seller make a mistake and send a defective item or a wrong item, I don't think you're allowed to just quote your shop policies and say ""sorry, on refunds"". Again, IMNAL but I'm pretty sure there are some exceptions to ""but my shop policies say so"".   With that out of the way:  (1) Depends. You either (a) refund the full amount (product+shipping) if you haven't sent out the item or if the refund is because of a mistake you made (e.g. sent out the wrong/defective product), (b) refund just the product price (or a %of) if everything was done properly but the customer doesn't wants a refund/exchange.  (2) Same as above. Your fault, you pay. Their choice, they pay.    (3) Answered above. Maybe another redditer can provide more info on this.   (4) Yes. Why do you think the buyer is trying to take advantage of you?"
Etsy,37bzao,littletinypiranha,1 point,Tue May 26 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight! As for the buyer taking advantage of me, He asked for a Discounted price which I gave, the package was not even a day late and wanted a further discount, I offered to fix the item then return it back to him (because all my products are made to order and I do not ship from inventory) he refused and wants a new item or keep the current one but for another discount. He believes this was a custom commission piece he paid for so I'm at fault shipping the wrong custom piece that was ""not up to par"" and wants another discount.. When all it was just a discount price on the existing piece.  I find it hard to believe my product got damage during shipping but maybe.... But all his response to my offers are a further Discount except a full refund."
Etsy,37bzao,bababby,3,Tue May 26 15:43:56 2015 UTC,Say no.
Etsy,37bzao,slo_bored,3,Tue May 26 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"In my shop, I have it noted in my returns policy that I will take returns within 14 days of purchase but the shipping is not refunded. The only time I refund the full price with shipping is if I sent the wrong item by accident or if the item arrived damaged or defective. The item must be returned unless they can prove via photo that the item was broken, etc.  I know in California that you cannot deduct Etsy or bank fees from the customers' purchase price, so you might check what the rules are where you live. If you have it stated in your returns policy that you do not take returns, then stick by it. Especially if you know you are being taken advantage of. If they don't return the merchandise, no refund. Period. You can't live in fear of one possible bad review. It's a business transaction. I can't think of one store that I can walk in to and state ""I bought something, but I don't want to bring it back, can I have a refund?"" and be able to walk out cash in hand."
Etsy,37bzao,dewprisms,2,Tue May 26 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"In the case you just described (nothing is wrong or damaged, he's just being overly picky, correct?) I would tell him that he can keep the discounted item and that's that or he can ship it back on his own dime for a full refund of the product cost minus shipping."
Etsy,37bzao,Jason-Genova,-4,Tue May 26 16:47:58 2015 UTC,IF it got damage during shipping that isn't a fault of your own. You should next time add in an option for them to buy mail insurance for a damaged item.
Etsy,37bzao,hi_bye,1 point,Wed May 27 01:31:27 2015 UTC,that's good to know. thank you.
Etsy,37bzao,FormSpaced,4,Wed May 27 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"That's actually false. It is on you to deliver the item to the customer in as shown condition, and on him/her to be available to receive it. You should be buying mail insurance anyway and building it into your prices because if someone received a damaged item, they could a go around you and get a refund from their payment processor anyway. Insurance doesn't cover them, it covers you.   EDIT: Their payment processor might force a return but they will require the return of the item to you. They won't ever force a discount. So it sounds like your customer is just nit picking to get a discount after the fact. I would say something along the lines of accepting returns in place of damage discounts. So he is welcome to send it back for a refund, but you won't be discounting the item any further. That is more than fair."
Etsy,37bzao,Christypaints,2,Wed May 27 12:43:17 2015 UTC,"I would not give partial refund. Especially if they are asking. That means they like it enough, but want a discount.  All sales final means no returns or exchanges. It's like going to a clothing shop that is closing for good. They want to get rid of their stuff, so they say, ALL SALES FINAL."
Etsy,37a9mr,Espe_193,9,Tue May 26 03:24:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not many buyers are willing to do wire transfers or WU to buy things as they have no consumer protection, so unless you can set up to accept Paypal, I would say that setting up an Etsy shop is not a good choice for you."
Etsy,37a9mr,sneaky_dragon,4,Tue May 26 03:49:02 2015 UTC,why cant you use your bank account with paypal??
Etsy,37a9mr,hebejebez,1 point,Tue May 26 03:48:42 2015 UTC,I can but like my bank account is not is the U.S. I can't take money out. I can spend the money I get but I can't take it out of my bank account.

Etsy,37a9mr,missy789,1 point,Tue May 26 03:58:30 2015 UTC,where are you? all i have read just says that only if you have a us bank you can retreat money
Etsy,37a9mr,hebejebez,4,Tue May 26 04:05:09 2015 UTC,I withdraw money from my Paypal account all the time to my Canadian bank. It automatically converts the money from USD to the Canadian dollar. PayPal takes an extra 2.5% for the currency conversion. It takes a few days to process (3-4 maybe) but its totally fine.

Etsy,37ddb7,raviax,0,Tue May 26 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"1) I DID search for ""copyright violation"" and my search came up with 1 post, which was someone asking about what to do if THEIR work was infringed.   2) never had that attitude  3) I didn't know nor think I was infringing.  The problem with the reddit community and apparently the Etsy community is that people are assholes and give cold responses. Whether the question is asked once or every 5 minutes, a simple ""hey, someone asked a similar question here would be nice."
Etsy,37ddb7,saleina,-2,Tue May 26 20:55:03 2015 UTC,Amen Hallelujah!
Etsy,37ddb7,swxw,9,Wed May 27 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"So it seems I've arrived late to the party.   First of all, I'm sorry you did not have a pleasant discussion within this subreddit, it does not reflect the normal happenings of r/etsy. However I'd like to elaborate on why you received such curt responses. For those of us who are very active in this subreddit, there are posts every second day of someone complaining about copyright. It's always the same thing - they didn't think they were infringing, they got notices and are freaking out. Or they are asking advice about whether or not an item is infringing. It's always the same excuses of ""but everyone else is doing it, why can't I?"" or ""it's just inspired by ___, I'm not hurting their sales"". Worst yet, they never come from the attitude of learning and are more often than not ""they're bullying me and picking on me!"" type of posts. Often, when we reach out nicely and try to educate someone about intellectual property infringement, we get ignored and/or they get extremely defensive.  I know you said in your edit that you never had the attitude of ""if everyone else is doing it, I can too"", but you said in your original post that ""there are many products on Etsy with the same design on them... but my listing was yanked"" which to us sounds like the same thing.   The bottom line is, if it's similar enough in likeness where someone can recognize the franchise/brand/character/game by the color schemes/shapes/designs of your item, then chances are it is infringing. If you are tagging your items a certain brand/character/name to ensure it comes up in searches, you'll probably get taken down since you are trying to profit from trademark.   Just because other people are doing it, doesn't mean they are right or that you should. If someone committed another crime such as murder, you wouldn't think it was okay just because they did it, would you? It's obviously not the same weight but the concept is the same.    A lot of Etsy sellers are worked up because Etsy is currently being sued in a class action lawsuit specifically because it has SO MANY infringing items. Etsy's stock has dropped as much as 50% in the last little while since the IPO and sellers are worried about the future of Etsy. In addition, Etsy will likely be cracking down a little harder on infringing items.   I did a quick search for ""copyright"" in this subreddit (please let me know if you don't know how to search specifically within a subreddit, I can show you) and you can see the results here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/search?q=copyright&restrict_sr=on  Here are some really great discussions about copyright on Etsy and sellers in the same predicament as you, I encourage you to read through the comments.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/3627w1/how_do_i_get_started_selling_things_on_etsy_xpost/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/35vkbl/anyone_ever_receive_a_dmca_copyright_take_down/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/329dff/is_selling_prints_with_disney_character/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/30i5c1/retsy_i_need_some_serious_advice_copyright/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/2oisvk/copyright_infringement/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/362ch3/copyrighttrademark_question/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/36iejf/a_copyright_question_harry_potter_inspired_items/  As well, here is a great video on intellectual property infringement posted by /u/boo_hiss: http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/35fpn6/crash_course_intellectual_property_video_series/  Please do your research. While we love helping other sellers, we are only human after all and get tired of repeating the same thing over and over again. Good luck!"
Etsy,37ddb7,saleina,5,Tue May 26 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"It really isn't sticky stuff at all.   If you create something that is ""inspired by"" it does not negate the fact that you are infringing.   Also, this is brought up at least once a week, so please look on past pages. The reasons why you are getting such (cold?) remarks, is because as a sub we are rather annoyed at how many copyright questions are re-asked.    just because others are doing it doesn't mean you should. period.  If you know you are infringing, and feel ""picked on"" because your product was pulled, then so be it. That is the risk you took doing it, and it isn't that you are being picked on.  If you have to ask then you are infringing. You will not get the go ahead from people here, and if you're looking for that then go elsewhere."
Etsy,37ddb7,saleina,0,Wed May 27 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"1) never had that attitude  2) I didn't know nor think I was infringing.   3) I was never looking for a go ahead  I DID search for ""copyright violation"" and my search came up with 1 post, which was someone asking about what to do if THEIR work was infringed.

Etsy,37ddb7,dearwilde,3,Tue May 26 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"The product I am a little irked about wasn't an exact copy of the elements in the game, but you can clearly identify that they are from a certain game   This is your own statement. Which is clearly an, ""inspired by _______"" whatever. But it was taken down because as you have just stated, those who know it, know where it is inspired by, thus is infringement.   The problem with Reddit is the fact that people don't search properly, or don't care to so everyday there is X amount of reposts. Simply putting in ""Copyright on etsy reddit"" on Google brought back HUNDREDS of replies.   The problem with the etsy community is, that people who infringe/copy/wholesale from china/ sell counterfeit goods are the reason why etsy is in the crapper.   That is why people are short with those who ask about copyright. Almost EVERY post about copyright here is why ______ was taken down, if others are doing the same thing.   If your products are at all: disney, marvel, videogames, etc... related and can have the ""inspired by"" title then it is infringement.   As you said, Hey MANY people have asked a similar question, you can find the list here"
Etsy,37ddb7,skunkhaus,6,Wed May 27 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"just curious what you all do in this situation.    Generally we try not to get into that situation in the first place.  Seriously though, if your work is original and you're not using Disney or Marvel or any other fandom or pop culture icons to sell/promote your work then you should never have anything to worry about (which is a good feeling, trust me!)"

Etsy,379sb4,therubyrocket,2,Tue May 26 01:02:29 2015 UTC,Some of your items are hard to see with the white backgrounds. Particularly this one. Maybe add another picture to the listing with it sitting on a colored background or much closer when it is on the black earring stand?
Etsy,379sb4,Christypaints,1 point,Tue May 26 16:07:51 2015 UTC,Read the Etsy seller's handbook and follow all the guidelines.  You need better titles and tags and fill out your shop policies. I would also include more dimensions of your gems and jewelry as well as what type of material you use for your chains and studs. Metal allergies are a serious thing.
Etsy,379sb4,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Tue May 26 01:17:33 2015 UTC,"In regards to metal content - I think here in Japan maybe they're not required to disclose what the metal content is?  I'm looking at all the packaging for my chain/beads/etc and the only thing it says is just ""If you have a metal allergy, maybe it's not a good idea to use"". I'll go through the handbook more carefully.  Thanks."
Etsy,379sb4,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Tue May 26 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Asian packaging sometimes isn't great on details. I would learn to distinguish the types of metals used so that people with silver or nickel allergies know if your jewelry is safe or not."
Etsy,379sb4,poxteeth,1 point,Tue May 26 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm a silver smith, so I know it's not silver.  The current stuff incorporates mass-produced elements, so it's not anything pure, I'm sure.  I'll throw up a generalized warning for nickel."
Etsy,378oy8,speakpig,5,Mon May 25 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  We are new in etsy also (you can see our critique post just below yours :) ) but me and my wife are both amateur photographers so we are wearing our photographer hats not etsy seller hats. I think there are more experienced people here who can judge your tags and policies and etc.  Anyway I think you should use better photos. You cropped some photos in a way that you cropped away some parts of your item. And background vs item contrast is not appealing.  I think your items are adorable. But using flash on metal objects is not a good idea. In almost all of your photos I can see the flash glow. You can use diffusers and professional flashes with professional cameras. But if you dont have such equipments you can try to shoot your items in daylight under shade. You can also shoot them outside in a cloudy but bright day (clouds are natural diffusers and sun is a perfect light source)  You should try putting your items over black or white background. Because those colors put an emphasis on gold. And try to use less textured fabric. Most of your backrounds have texture that tires my eye.  There are some product shooting boxes on amazon which are as cheap as 30 dollars.   If you plan to shoot indoors you should use day light light bulbs. And you can use a fabric to difuse the light coming from the light source.  Another thing is you put your gold item infront of a cold cup. Which makes it difficult to seperate the item from the back ground.  I think it is better to use live models (your friends may be) for the clothing. You can crop their heads out if they don't want to be seen. Again diffused light and cropping is same as above.  I hope our reviews help."
Etsy,378oy8,realpatrickstar,1 point,Mon May 25 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about the photos, just starting out so unfortunately I'm stuck using my phone as a camera and my house is painted all sorts of crazy colours so I'll try and find an area that's not so dark.  My house is always dark so I use a bright lamp to light the pictures but I can definitely figure out something else!  My mannequin has seen better days for sure so I'll look in to an alternative!  Thanks for the feedback :)"
Etsy,378oy8,realpatrickstar,2,Mon May 25 20:27:13 2015 UTC,Your welcome fellow redditor and etsyian :)  There are great online free resources for cell phone photography tricks. There are also some apps for filters and exposure settings for cell phones as well.  If you won't be using professional flashes or studio lightings you should definitely use sunlight as much as possible. Like I mentioned above try to change your light bulbs with day light versions and put a piece of white fabric in front of them (keep a few feets distance or the fabric might burn).

Etsy,377aog,realpatrickstar,4,Mon May 25 13:43:56 2015 UTC,"Such adorable items! I think everything looks great in terms of titles, tags, and policies.  Two things I would suggest- in your listings with the needle felted mobile animals, since you mention they could come off and be a baby toy, it'd be nice to know a general size.  My other suggestion is that your photography looks amazing, but I would include a picture of your item in context, if you can. Show your wreath on a door or above a mantle, and from far enough away to include the whole room. Same with your mobile. If you can, show it hanging over a crib and include the whole nursery.   Keep up the good work!"
Etsy,377aog,cherryfristado,1 point,Mon May 25 19:20:55 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your kind compliments and feedback. We will definitely try to include a photo of our item in context.

Etsy,377aog,swxw,1 point,Mon May 25 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your feedback. We will double check everything before we send items, we would be devastated if our products hurt little fellows."
Etsy,377aog,jbbnorth,3,Tue May 26 05:20:36 2015 UTC,"While I generally agree that your pricing is a tad high for my tastes, I think that is fine as long as you are being competitive with other products in the same category. It's simple - there are always going to be people who can't afford or aren't willing to pay for a luxury item that is handmade. Also it's generally assumed that since it's handmade it will cost more. It's not going to be the same quality as going out to Toys'R'Us and getting a $15 set, and the price should reflect that. People who are looking for well-made, authentic and handmade items should be prepared to pay what is competitive, and they will if they like your item.   I don't have a baby nor am I in a financial position to be able to afford an item like this as a gift, so I do perceive your item as expensive. But with that said, it's entirely possible that my perception will change once I have a baby or a better job. It's all very subjective, so don't be put down by people who are telling you your prices are too expensive! The worst thing you can do is undervalue your work and end up hating it, which can sometimes happen if you price things too low for fear of overpricing. If your item's quality reflects the price and your price is competitive, you will succeed! :)"
Etsy,377aog,underthetootsierolls,2,Mon May 25 23:40:18 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your positive and encouraging comments :). I hope your financial position improves as soon as possible :).
Etsy,377aog,ledeux,3,Tue May 26 05:28:55 2015 UTC,"I'm cringing at all these comments about your prices being too high. Only you know what your time is worth. Pricing is something I struggle with and I have posted about it before here and one person posted something about how it's all about branding, and I totally agree. If your mobile was hanging in a nice artsy type gift shop, no one would flinch at paying $60-$70. If you were at a flea market surrounded by people selling cheap stuff with your mobiles just set on a table people would think your same mobiles are overpriced. So my advice I guess is that if you want to charge that, which I totally think you should, you need to make sure you brand yourself as though you are selling in the artsy gift shop. For example, a photo of your mobile in a well styled baby room and maybe a picture of how you would send it in a cute well packaged box. Hope that makes sense and good luck!"
Etsy,377aog,WaterlooPrincess,2,Tue May 26 03:24:02 2015 UTC,That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much for your feedback. My wife have great ideas about packaging. We will make sure to add photos of packaged item.  We will also find more ideas for correct and succesfull branding.
Etsy,377aog,hebejebez,1 point,Tue May 26 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think your prices are too high at all! People constantly underprice handmade goods. As someone else stated your branding needs to reflect high-end products. Which you are doing, pics are very important. I would like to see it over a crib for scale.  Know your market, and don't let other people make you feel like you should lower your price. They will not buy it, but others will. You are not marketing to them anyway."

Etsy,3745c2,BITDClassics,2,Sun May 24 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"Looks good, but the thumbnail for your whole doesn't scale correctly on mobile.   Love those signs too. I'm always curious as to if those actually sell at high prices plus shipping.  And whether those are a pita to ship.   Keep playing with it. You're doing things right."
Etsy,3745c2,tom8o,1 point,Sun May 24 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to check me out. That thumbnail was just supposed to be a place holder to get started, but I forgot to update it, so thanks for reminding me. The signs can be very expensive to ship as they have to go via truck, but we have a great company we use to crate and ship them and they make it easy. We have had pretty good success selling them in the past, but I am worried that Etsy shoppers may suffer from shock when they find out it costs as much as $500 or more for shipping."
Etsy,3745c2,tom8o,2,Sun May 24 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"No problem.   Wouldn't be too worried about sticker shock for those items on Esty.  I have seen a lot of traffic from Google and social media and I think that people won't care that it's on etsy vs any other web site.  And for a .20 listing fee, it's no biggie.  The only other thing worth considering might be to list it on amazon.  Yes they will take a big cut, but you could raise the price accordingly and perhaps the increased visibility will pay off.  With Amazon you'd need a UPC code, but you could reassign it when the items sells.   Good luck!"
Etsy,3745c2,tom8o,1 point,Sun May 24 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"Most of what I sell does not have UPC Codes, which is a requirement to sell on Amazon. I thought that this would make Amazon of limits, but I have been reading about Amazon allowing homemade items and this has me thinking that there might be a solution for vintage items. Do you know how the UPC Code requirement works with vintage items?"
Etsy,3745c2,Christypaints,1 point,Sun May 24 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"I should clarify...  I have 5 items on Amazon, each with a unique barcode I purchased for that specific item.  As all of my work is handmade, I reuse the same barcode for each variation.  (I list a stock of 10 for each item.). These five are my best sellers on Etsy (more to cross over) and all are handmade.  You could buy five UPC codes and use them for five items - reassigning them when the first item sells."
Etsy,370wp2,LucaC,8,Sat May 23 20:52:13 2015 UTC,I don't see why not. Its not like they're saying you have to pick one or the other. Amazon is a great platform.

I don't have numbers to compare, but I believe the ease of Amazon gift cards opens a whole new realm of buyers that would have never considered buying on Etsy.  I hope gift card sales are a possibility."
Etsy,370wp2,icanhasreclaims,6,Sun May 24 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"My family's jewelry business got drawn into the Amazon storefront thing a couple of years back. It wasn't their handmade marketplace deal, but still an amazon small business thingie. They made us feel great cause they had 'chosen' us, so we went all in.  This is what we dealt with:  *$39.99 auto debit from our business account monthly.   Our photos weren't good enough, so we had to 'clean' them up- cropped background, reflection beneath, certain size aspect, etc etc etc. If they were wrong they got rejected. We tried doing it ourselves in PS, but it got to be so lengthy of a process that we jobbed it out to a compnay for a buck or two a photo. That alone cost us over a grand. Special .CSV file to upload items, had to weigh and measure aspects of our work. Couple hundred man hours there, please paying our web dev to create the .csv upload file thingie (sorry not well versed in some of this) Once we got our product up there, we were buried behind hundreds of sellers from all around the globe. We could pay extra to promote or advance ourselves (like you can on etsy) but it was just out of our reach after all we'd dumped into it. No sales, ever. Two years of that auto debit, a few grand worth of work, etc.  When we had an issue (like struggles with out .csv after making it exactly like they wanted) their 'special support team' was nonexistent. Emails for help went unanswered for weeks. But when we did somethign wrong (like accidentally uploading a pic without a cropped background) they were right on our case.  Compare this with over 800 sales on our etsy shop alone, about a thousand from our website, and hundreds of custom jobs... we dropped it all recently.    Now i know what they're offering is different, and i love that they are trying to directly compete with the bloated Etsy model... but after I went thru all of this with the jewelry business, there'd have to be MAJOR changes for me to risk it with my fledgling resin business."
Etsy,370wp2,midlifecrackers,6,Sun May 24 17:58:51 2015 UTC,What I'm wondering is if the typical Amazon frequenter would appreciate handmade and the price that comes along with stuff being handmade.
Etsy,370wp2,orangebanananaapples,4,Sun May 24 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"Imo I think that Amazon would be half way there with a wide market but would need to draw a different crowd's attention with their marketing. People don't go to Amazon for hand made items because it's not a thing, yet, but a convenience factor could play as a huge benefit."
Etsy,370wp2,DropDead_Slayer,3,Sun May 24 04:18:07 2015 UTC,The reason I use Amazon and pay for Amazon prime is so I don't have to give my email to a dozen different websites to get the stuff I want. I'd be more likely to buy from Amazon than etsy.
Etsy,370wp2,Iceducky,11,Sun May 24 04:26:58 2015 UTC,Definitely
Etsy,370wp2,Dnadnnoid,2,Sat May 23 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"This comment is exactly why I follow /r/Etsy.  It's all about Etsy, but keeping an open mind and perspective to selling one's work to the best of our abilities."
Etsy,370wp2,tom8o,3,Sun May 24 16:45:00 2015 UTC,My predictions 1. It will be a juried site 2. It will also allow true independent designers who have a large hand in producing their work with other small businesses ( example a potter who has their work fired at a local studio. A photographer who has their photos printed at a lab. An illustrator who has their work laser cut by another small company) 3. Only other artists who argue about how handmade something is will care about #2 4. Many shops that apply will be in for a rude awakening that they can't sell their disney inspired craft 5. Amazon is in for a rude awakening because dealing with a bunch of crafters is a lot different than dealing with a bunch of business people. As a whole on the forums I find we are loud vocal
Etsy,370wp2,figment81,2,Mon May 25 12:09:23 2015 UTC,Prediction: $40+ a month to have a storefront plus commission on each sale.    Would you still sell on it?
Etsy,370wp2,giantslor,6,Sun May 24 01:56:54 2015 UTC,It might be worth it. Amazon has a very high traffic site and is very well known as a great and secure place to buy from.
Etsy,370wp2,DropDead_Slayer,3,Sun May 24 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"I think it will be for a lot of people. I think anyone whose shop has moved from hobby territory to small business territory would be crazy not to move to amazon.  I look at the three major marketplaces like this:  ebay===> flea market etsy===> craft fair amazon===> retailer  If people don't see the benefits of moving from a craft fair to a retailer, then they need to rethink their goals.  This is really going to hurt the etsy marketplace imo... it's looking more and more like the ipo was a detriment to etsy sellers."
Etsy,370wp2,giantslor,1 point,Sun May 24 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I agree it would be a step up, and with the way things are looking, Amazon could come in and take over no problem since recent events."
Etsy,370wp2,DropDead_Slayer,1 point,Sun May 24 04:20:49 2015 UTC,"No.  Amazon doesnt charge a fee just to have a store for regular stuff, so it wouldnt make sense for them to do it here either."
Etsy,370wp2,thisotherthing,3,Sun May 24 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"No. If you sell over 40 items per month you use their pro merchant plan. If you sell under 40 items per month on amazon, you just have an amazon hobby."
Etsy,370wp2,giantslor,1 point,Sun May 24 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the point is you can still have a ""store"" and sell things without a monthly fee.  Yes, you can go the monthly fee route if you want to get serious about it, but anyone who wants to can at least list something and hope that it sells with the fees only happening if it actually gets bought.  A $40 monthly fee just for the ability to sell even one handmade item will cut out the little guys/hobbists.  If amazon doesnt care about them, then I guess this isnt a problem, but if they are actualy tryng to fully compete with etsy I would think they would take this into account."
Etsy,370wp2,thisotherthing,1 point,Mon May 25 21:54:58 2015 UTC,There's a $1 listing fee per listing  if you don't have the plan. The plan is $40. That's why people get the plan at 40 items.  Amazon's fees are much  much higher.
Etsy,370wp2,giantslor,1 point,Mon May 25 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"Even at $1 up-front to list, that's still better than a $40 monthly fee for anyone who has less than 40 items (obviously).  Someone doing this as a hobby who only has a handful of things to sell at any one time might have a hard time justifing that 40 bucks.  I just hope Amazon doesn't forget about them, and go soley the monthly fee route.  I doubt they will though.  I would imagine it will end up working just like it does now?"

Etsy,370wp2,TunaNugget,4,Mon May 25 22:32:39 2015 UTC,I sell some of my handmade items already. I list them as my brand. All you need is a UPC code to list your unique product.
Etsy,370wp2,CharlesBronsonsaurus,2,Sun May 24 05:58:28 2015 UTC,Curious about this - how does it compare with Etsy as a sales channel?
Etsy,370wp2,ryb0t0,3,Sun May 24 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I am not on the Handmade at Amazon marketplace nor have I been contacted about it.  I just realized I could sell my items on there by simply obtaining UPC codes.  How does it compare?    Well for starters it feels much less personal.  I don't connect as much with my buyers as it's usually a quick affair.  The fees are certainly different and the way shipping is set up is a challenge I am still trying to work through.  Since I sell somewhat popular items based off of my favorite video games it is easy for me to get sales and exposure.  I would assume that the Handmade market place is going to be better for people who have absolutely unique items.  I have gotten way more sales   My suggestion is to go on ebay and get some UPC codes.  You can get 25 for under 2.00 give or  take a cent.  Put a listing on Amazon and see how it does.  It's straight forward enough to list."
Etsy,370wp2,CharlesBronsonsaurus,1 point,Sun May 24 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I have been wanting to jump into amazon but the UPC thing scared me off. This past week I applied to register my brand so I could circumvent the UPC codes, but that's proving difficult."
Etsy,370wp2,jbbnorth,1 point,Sun May 24 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"Once you get the codes, you can have your item listed fairly quickly.   The main photo however must be on an all white background so if you do plan to list, take photos with white sheets or do some photoshop work."

Etsy,370wp2,laaanis,1 point,Sun May 24 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"I would, but I'd read their terms very carefully first.    The Amazon app store agreement has some unpleasant surprises.  For example, there's no automated way for a publisher to remove an app from their store, and they don't have to remove an item just because you ask them to.  Although something like that doesn't necessarily translate to handmade items, to me it indicates a willingness to introduce some non-standard and maybe questionable terms."
Etsy,370yi4,Noctier,3,Sat May 23 21:08:04 2015 UTC,If you paid with PayPal you can go to them and get your refund.  I'd contact Etsy one more time to see if you can get a resolution but if I didn't have a valid tracking number within 24 hours it would be refund time in my opinion.
Etsy,370yi4,xakeridi,3,Sat May 23 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yes go ahead and escalate it. This will alert the seller & eventually your order will one way or another- get resolved. I had a bad encounter with a seller this past February and she said my order was shipping 'the very next day' only after I became concerned about my order taking way too long to arrive. This 'next day' never happened and she ended up shutting her shop down, unable to complete the order due to personal reasons -(she broke her foot). I am sure her injury had validity, but  it didn't help that there were a barrage of mediocre shipping time reviews complaining of incredibly slow shipping for her shop. What irritated me while I waited & wondered why my item was weeks overdue,  was seeing her Instagram; constant uploads of photos of her silly crafts and stuff she was making when she was supposedly too injured to create and unable to continue her paid impending Commissions such as mine and who knows what else. I have never left a negative review of a fellow seller, and my order was finally reimbursed on the final day that it could be, but this particular situation with this lady makes me want to put a stop to her doing it to others; I would just hate to ever be on the other end of that experience since I am a seller also."
Etsy,370yi4,tramplamps,2,Sun May 24 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"Open a case, now. And with your credit card / pay pal, etc. there is no excuse at all, especially with the lack of communication."

Etsy,370yi4,emergingeminence,1 point,Sat May 23 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"Nope they're not too far from me. I recently placed another order from even farther away, and it's already gotten here. The only excuse I can think of is maybe they're out of stock (it's a wholesale item) and had to order more. But if that's the case, it was never communicated to me."
Etsy,370yi4,handmadeincome,1 point,Sat May 23 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"If the item is out of stock, the listing shouldn't be active UNLESS the description clearly states it is out of stock and will be shipped upon arrival. Either way, the seller should communicate the status of your order. There's simply no excuse for poor communication. I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this problem, and I agree with the others that you should escalate now."
Etsy,370yi4,woodeye,1 point,Sun May 24 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"I am a long time etsy seller and what you describe is completely unreasonable.  The fact that it is not an international order, and that they never gave you tracking info after marking it as shipped means they are either lying outright about shipping it, or something has gone deeply wrong on their end.  Either way you absolutely need to file a complaint and request immediate cancellation and a full refund of your order.  Do not wait, do it now."
Etsy,370yi4,tom8o,1 point,Sun May 24 20:51:04 2015 UTC,Escalate and hold them to a high standard.
Etsy,370yi4,faith_trustpixiedust,1 point,Sat May 23 23:54:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely escalate. Don't worry about how much time has passed. I had the same thing happen, and i got a refund 2 months after I purchased. I am a seller and I needed the product to make my own products. The seller never marked shipped, never replied to my messages.. anything. They didn't update their shop to say that anything happened either. Now that I think about it, I hope that person is ok."
Etsy,36y06m,lovelyalone,10,Sat May 23 01:38:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. If she leaves a negative review it may fall under Etsy's Anti-Extortion policy, and you can request for Etsy support to remove the review."

Etsy,36y06m,geogabs,3,Sat May 23 06:59:11 2015 UTC,Just make sure you've been conversing through Etsy conversations and not texts or emails.
Etsy,36y06m,sneaky_dragon,6,Sat May 23 05:14:14 2015 UTC,Yes you did. If she gives you a bad review mention what you did for the client and how many times you sent out the things and include that you even gave her an extra as a compensation and that you're sorry that she's not leaving a good review but that you were not going to let her blackmail you by getting her extra stuff AND her money back after you fixed the mistake; and even more so since she subtly threatened to do so.
Etsy,36y06m,kokomocat,3,Sat May 23 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"well, she fired off a message accusing me of being cavalier and careless about my crappy customer service --- I'm sure she'll leave negative feedback :("

Etsy,36y06m,sirius_moonlight,3,Sat May 23 02:29:52 2015 UTC,Don't respond to the feedback until you've shown Etsy the convo about the feedback extortion. Once you respond you're locked in. I don't think Etsy will remove it then.
Etsy,36y06m,Christypaints,1 point,Sat May 23 12:59:11 2015 UTC,Just show it to Etsy. They should stand up for you if you have had all your communications through their messaging.
Etsy,36y06m,Blackandthemoon,1 point,Sun May 24 00:12:23 2015 UTC,Take photos of the conversation and explain all the steps you took to etsy. I recently had a 3 star review removed because the buyer said my items didn't come framed - which is stated in the listing itself - so etsy removed it for false info.
Etsy,36w6ix,jbbnorth,13,Fri May 22 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"You might want to try that, it is a little weird, but it might help. I usually wouldn't suggest that, but I think in this situation it might be a good (or at least an okay) idea.   After a week, since that would give enough time to change it, if she doesn't you might want to respond to the review with the apology for the bend and hope her mom enjoys the 2nd one you sent out to replace it.  Then, at least, the next customer who looks at it sees that you make amends.  Good luck!"
Etsy,36w6ix,sirius_moonlight,1 point,Fri May 22 17:24:34 2015 UTC,I think it sounds ok. I'd probably do something similar in that situation.
Etsy,36w6ix,geogabs,1 point,Fri May 22 23:27:43 2015 UTC,It's not normal practice but sometimes you may need to ask.  It look me something like 8 months to get my first 6 reviews.  Someone bought 4 small items and only gave me 4/5 stars with no explaination - killing my feedback. I asked if I had done something wrong and if not would they consider changing the feedback.  They did.
Etsy,36w6ix,tom8o,1 point,Sat May 23 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd go ahead and send that message. I asked a couple of times in one of my shops when I had resolved problems.   However the last time I asked someone was last year, they left a really sarcastic review about the size of the item, I messaged the person pointing out that ""tiny"" was in the title and in the description I had wrote ""please read the measurements carefully as this is very small"" and put exact measurements, obviously I sent a nicely worded message! :P They admitted they hadn't read the description but went on to change it to one star and wrote a crazy ranty paragraph using my name repeatedly. Etsy removed it for me in the end!  I don't wanna scare you though, the vast majority of people are very reasonable"

Etsy,36wqcy,HildasAttic,3,Fri May 22 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"I sell vintage items too, and GURRRL, let me tell you. (Don't even know if you're a girl, but I'm stickin' with it.) It is going to be a headache. But what you CAN do is make it easier on yourself by putting in hours now. Yes hours, but stay with me.  I was all sorts of confused both when I started, and well... sometimes I still am. The only thing I can do, and trust me I am not perfect, is to tell you what works for me.  I sell mostly books, maps, and toys. We might be in different areas of the vintage world, but think of us as second cousins. A lot of what you would deal with, I do too. Below are some steps I suggest trying out.   Get a scale. My fiance got me this one from Amazon, and it is perfect. Yes, it's $20.00 but it will save your ass. It only goes up to 55 pounds, but if you're weighing stuff heavier than that, you're going to have other issues. Now, weigh your items that you have in stock. Put them in a google document / write them down. For all future listings, plan on weighing each item. It seems like you package like items in similar ways. Meaning whether the cup and saucer is a bit smaller or larger, you put two boxes, add packing materials, etc. Try packing up a cup and saucer with all the packing peanuts and boxes. Weigh that. Now do it with another 2-3 other cups and saucers of similar size. Subtract the original weight of the items from the new weight (which is with all the boxes and packing materials) and see what the difference is. Find an average weight of the packing materials and boxes. This is the added weight you should add on to each cup and saucer combo that you list on etsy. So let's say the cup and saucer are 6 ounces. The packing material is 5 ounces. So you're at 11 ounces total. Use the shipping calculator and enter your dimensions from the box you're using (try to keep the boxes within a normal size range otherwise you'll be charged extra) and there you have what it will cost you through etsy, to ship a cup and saucer. At this point also on the calculator, you can see international prices. Jot down the prices for the top international places they have on the list. Yes it's going to be expensive, but if they want it they'll buy it. This is where if you need to add money for handling or for shipping items (bubble wrap, boxes, etc.) you add it with the 11 ounce price etsy quoted you.  This is the most tedious part (I know, wait didn't we already do the most tedious part?) but also the most important. Make shipping profiles. Have it named with what type of item (cup and saucer) how much the item weighs (6 ounces) + how much the packaging weighs (5 ounces) total weight (11 ounces) and the box size (either in dimensions or in style/type) Your listing title would look something like this:   1 Cup and Saucer (5 ounces) + packaging (6 ounces) = 11 ounces total - 15 x 10 x 3"" Max  The reason why you go through all this trouble, is so when you're listing another item you can easily pick which shipping profile to use. You choose the profile based on how much your item weighs, having already measured the weight of the packing material combined with it. Also, this step helps if you have boxes of similar size.   This is probably really really confusing, but I swear I'm trying to not make it so. Please ask any questions if you have any. Vintage can be really tricky to package correctly and economically.   I've went crazy trying to figure this stuff out. Let me know if I need to clarify!"
Etsy,36wqcy,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Fri May 22 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"Oh this is great!!   Ok we already weigh things, and put them into our inventory spreadsheet, so we've got that down and that's nice since it's one less thing to learn I guess.   With your shipping profiles, are you using calculated shipping? Like, the price will change depending on where you're sending it on the buyers end?  Or are you doing general shipping amounts? It sounds like you're doing calculated...   I also saw somewhere about cutting boxes down to make them fit your items... and though time consuming it looks like the thing to do.  If I'm shipping a 16"" platter it makes no sense for the box it's in to be like 20"" and square!    I am totally going to throw questions at you if you don't mind. I'm at work-work right now though, but I wanted to thank you for your reply,  vintage cousin!"
Etsy,36wqcy,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Fri May 22 23:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'm calculating the shipping using etsy's calculator. I'm not having them do it for me, because of the issues some of the users have claimed. Put your weight and dimensions into the calculator and make your own shipping profiles. That's what I did and explained in the huge wall-o-text. That way you can add your own extra costs in, if need be.  Also the shipping prices are cheaper through etsy - which is what the calculator gives you - just an fyi they show you their cost and the post office cost. Savings like that add up!  Cutting down boxes might work - or simply finding a source of free boxes in the are that are a wide range of sizes?   NP, glad I could help! :D"
Etsy,36wqcy,MattsyKun,2,Sat May 23 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"If a buyer wants something bad enough, they'll gladly shell out that money to get their order to them safely. A lot of money for something that's $27 sounds about right (I ordered 18 pounds of fur, and paid almost 40 in shipping, I think, so that doesn't sound too far off to me!)  If you can, a good thing to invest in is a scale from USPS or wherever. That way, you can weigh things in the comfort of your own home/studio. Get a thing, weigh it yourself, use the calculated shipping, and then adjust slightly for packing materials inside, gifts, business cards, etc (because that stuff does add up).  My next suggestion would be to, if you can, just take an object to the post office in a box and just ask for the weight. I do this literally ALL the time with the first order of a new product. Sure, that does mean I'll occassionally eat the shipping cost (but my products are generally small :P)  With that weight, THEN you can calculate shipping properly. Have something similar? Adjust the shipping as you see fit.   Another thing you can always do, is take one of the more heavier items that you intend on keeping (but is similar to things you sell) and weigh it. Then, write that weight down. Whenever you get another thing ready to sell, compare that object's weight to your base item. Means you take a couple fewer less trips to the post office.  I always include insurance in the cost of shipping, because who knows what could happen? With you shipping China, I'd expect you to include insurance. Because we all know USPS isn't always 100%. :P  Hope all this makes sense. It looks kinda scattered to me :P"
Etsy,36wqcy,MattsyKun,1 point,Fri May 22 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"We have a scale and include the weight of our items in our inventory spread sheet, so that's easy peasy.

Etsy,36wqcy,littletinypiranha,1 point,Fri May 22 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"Either or.   OR! you can have a ""reserved"" dummy listing and you just put in the weight, and calculate it,including insurance. As I said, if it's in the shipping price and someone wants it, theyll pay for it"
Etsy,36wqcy,littletinypiranha,1 point,Sun May 24 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the shipping PDFs for Etsy say but I found it extremely useful to look at the individual shipping rate PDFs from the different, major postal carriers.   The thing with the online postage calculators is that they won't tell you whether that extra inch on your box makes your package cost twice as much as if you used a smaller box. Which is why looking at the postal rate PDFs give you a much better idea of the min/max dimensions for each type of delivery service as well as where each of their price brackets lie. Granted they usually only list the counter prices so the price you're paying will likely be lower, but at least the price brackets will be the same so you know the limits to pack your package within. You can always then feed those dimensions into Etsy to get the correct amount.   Don't quote me on this but I think couriers like FedEx and UPS have better rates for heavier/larger items? Maybe. I'm really not sure but it's worth looking into.   Typically I like to input my own shipping costs because I'll round the numbers to account for packing materials/handing/etc. For my first few packages while I was still figuring stuff out, I set the shipping costs to be a bit higher and just refunded the difference. I figured that it was better to refund shipping than have to ask the customer for more.   Like /u/JessicaAnnsEmporium said, definitely make use of the shipping profiles for like items. While I don't use the Etsy calculator, I do make use of the shipping profiles for items I mail the same way.   Good luck!"
Etsy,36wqcy,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Sat May 23 01:13:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed reply! This is sound advice. I'll be looking at the PDFs promptly. You and /u/JessicaAnnsEmporium have really given me great direction and things to learn! Thank you!
Etsy,36wqcy,littletinypiranha,1 point,Sat May 23 02:53:03 2015 UTC,Glad to help! I took a while to figure out all these things when I was starting out too. Still learning but at least not as frantic as when I first started :P
Etsy,36t7vo,sneaky_dragon,9,Thu May 21 22:47:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. If anyone can topple Etsy, it'll be Amazon. Problem is, Amazon's fees are a lot more than Etsy. But at the same time, Amazon has a huge market of buyers. Some give and take needed. I signed up!"
Etsy,36t7vo,VinylVineyard,3,Thu May 21 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"We can only speculate for now, but maybe they'll go a bit easier on us? Either way, the rates are still cheaper than consignment and if Amazon promotes handmade well, I'd happily give 20%."
Etsy,36t7vo,CircuitBreakerLabs,3,Fri May 22 16:24:26 2015 UTC,Amazon's fees are a lot more than Etsy   I was thinking the same thing. Amazon will take away the sellers who have been able to scale up their handmade business into something more serious than a hobby. And their reach is going to be so much larger than with etsy.
Etsy,36t7vo,giantslor,1 point,Sat May 23 00:18:10 2015 UTC,Where do you see the fee structure for this? Or are you just going off what they generally charge?

My company creates instantaneous, powerful websites for Etsy sellers, that sync up with (and link back to your Etsy store) for your ecommerce transactions.  It's intended to help sellers with brand building and social media, and, hey, some folks just like having an awesome website.    We're still in invite only beta (launching June 21) but if you want to get a sneak peek, just enter your info here http://beeswaxwebsites.com and use ""Reddit"" as your referral code so I know where you came from.  This is a commercial product, so we're planning on charging 12.99/month to host these websites, once the site launches.  It's 100% free for now.    edited: dumb spelling mistake."

I too am tired of reading about it and think we should have a stickied topic and a sidebar pointing to it. So I agree with you.   I really think we should talk about other things in this subreddit, rather than repeating the same threads over and over."
Etsy,36uenu,briekachu,3,Fri May 22 05:44:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. On the same line of thought, I'm all for helping people with shop critiques but it does get really repetitive when you're giving the same exact advice because they didn't bother reading any of the previous critique threads or even the handy links in the sidebar.   We're much more likely to give better and more detailed critique when we don't have to be bothered with the simple stuff like ""make sure you fill out all your shop policies and that your pictures aren't blurry""."
Etsy,36uenu,littletinypiranha,4,Fri May 22 06:02:00 2015 UTC,REPORT THE CRITIQUE THREADS THAT DONT GIVE INFO TO PROVE THEY'VE DONE THEIR DUE DILIGENCE!  Seriously. I remove them frequently when reported unless they have 5 or more helpful comments on them.

Etsy,36uenu,k80k80k80,2,Fri May 22 16:29:50 2015 UTC,Hit the Report button. Reports always go to the mod queue of the subreddit the thread is posted in.
Etsy,36uenu,courtneyj,2,Fri May 22 16:53:54 2015 UTC,I updated the sidebar a little. Asking that critique threads not following the rules be reported and the bottom point about reporting says specifically to hit the report link.
Etsy,36uenu,courtneyj,2,Mon May 25 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, ranting really is not productive. I edited my post to reflect this. I just saw a very recent post about IP infringement and it just all bubbled out... At least I had the sense to add the ""warning"" :)"
Etsy,36uenu,boo_hiss,4,Fri May 22 06:25:21 2015 UTC,"Here's a resource for starters, I posted it almost two weeks ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/35fpn6/crash_course_intellectual_property_video_series/  I'll agree. I'm getting a little frustrated with the ""I don't understand why they removed my item/shop"", ""Etsy is picking on me"", ""everybody else does it why am I the only one"" posts and comments. (Ok, yes, if Etsy isn't notifying people that's a problem but if you're using Disney characters what did you expect?)  I think to myself regularly that rather than a link to the (IMO unhelpful and disorganized) seller handbook, this sub needs its own big, bold text, top of the sidebar etsy 101 tutorial/wiki/thing to cover the basics of things we give out in shop critiques over and over and over again."
Etsy,36uenu,boo_hiss,2,Fri May 22 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"I did recall seeing those videos and they are a terrific resource! Thank you for posting those.   I honestly want to believe that when stuff like that happens, that people really didn't know that they were infringing and thought it was okay. But somehow I feel like that it's the case less than I would like to think, because a lot of people who do complain about receiving c&d's or getting shut down already knew what they were doing, and thought they could get away with it."
Etsy,36uenu,courtneyj,3,Fri May 22 06:27:53 2015 UTC,"Combo of educational failure (most people never learn anything about copyright), internet failure (rampant IP theft has become normalized), and this sort of cavalier disregard and entitlement.  I occasionally get all old and grumpy in remembering earlier days of the internet when artist's websites featured little buttons to sites like whatiscopyright.org and thescoop.net. Then I quietly misquote Monty Python and the Holy Grail to myself, ""I'm 27, I'm not old!"""
Etsy,36uenu,boo_hiss,2,Fri May 22 06:37:38 2015 UTC,"Most people are viewing on a device that doesn't show them a sidebar so a lot of the dumb questions will continue to be asked. Think of it like this...45% of people might read the sidebar, of those less than half would likely click further into a wiki before posting, and probably half of that would search for answers.   I'm fine with shutting down bad conversation if that's what the majority of the people want, but that hasn't been the case. So if the copyright stuff is harming the community for you feel free to down vote the shit out of it."
Etsy,36uenu,courtneyj,2,Fri May 22 09:53:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, people probably wouldn't read it. But like over at /r/abrathatfits and other subs, we could just send them on to the info, rather than consistently re-hashing the same things. Another option, putting it onto the submissions page (though TMI and clutter can become an issue, and people still don't read). I think most of the mobile clients have a way to see the sidebar, it just isn't shown by default and a lot of people don't seem to know how - same difference?  Downvoting would satisfy the immediate irritation, but it doesn't really do anything to stop the tide of newcomers or help these people get the answers they need. I don't know that removing threads is really the answer, as much as just making info more easily accessible. I think with every example of these posts, there's somebody who sees that and maybe learns something about how copyrights and etsy work.  ETA: I think you're doing well in moderating the community, this is just a time for resources over rules."
Etsy,36uenu,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Fri May 22 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"I've changed the submission page numerous times to try and address things, and it ends up too long and no one reads it as well. Go look and see if you can make some suggestions on it.   Also, let me know when a good post comes up that you want to refer back to frequently. There's a section of the sidebar for those and I can add new stuff to it...from then on, if a person hasn't done the diligence of searching for an answer or asking something that's rehashed all the time send them that link and then report the thread."
Etsy,36uenu,courtneyj,1 point,Fri May 22 21:50:06 2015 UTC,What about making a stickied post of FAQ/advice? Those will show up on mobile devices I believe.

Etsy,36uenu,littletinypiranha,1 point,Fri May 22 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"There are slow days in the middle of the Share Your Stuff thread, but it picks up again on the weekends. Also it does get unstickied when there's important other threads. When it does get unstickied there's an uptick in spam. What's funny is there's still 3-5 people per week who post links to the sub using the old way of tagging and posting that's been gone for over a year now.  I've looked into AutoModerator but I do prefer to still run this by hand for now."

Etsy,36uenu,MattsyKun,3,Fri May 22 07:13:56 2015 UTC,I've done surveys about removing posts  dealing with infringement issues or closing them and the vast majority of people wanted discussions to continue as is without moderation interference and let it be handled by down vote.
Etsy,36s1xx,VinylVineyard,6,Thu May 21 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"It really is. I certainly enjoy selling lots of stuff, but when my customers are thrilled with their new treasure - it means that much more, doesn't it?   Over 3 years and over 1,000 sales, we've managed to still hold a 5-star rating. That's a feather in my cap. ;-)  We don't really do anything to encourage reviews. My lovely and talented Farmwife does all of our shipping, and really goes all out with the packaging/presentation. People always mention that in the reviews. I think that helps a lot.   What is the ratio? Maybe 25% of buyers take the time to leave a review?   The ones that annoy me are the ""OMG this is the greatest product ever! The packaging is beautiful! It's no much nicer than I thought it would be! Shipping was lightning fast! - 4 stars"".   Hey! What happened to that fifth one? :-P"
Etsy,36s1xx,baldylox,3,Thu May 21 20:36:33 2015 UTC,I hate it when that happens! Some people are just like that. I often read other seller's reviews when I'm considering buying an item and I hate it when customers seem to have no complaint yet do not give 5 stars. I haven't encountered this yet myself (knock on wood) but I would be really annoyed for sure.
Etsy,36s1xx,swxw,2,Fri May 22 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"Eh - it's not that annoying. Ya gotta let the little stuff go.   That's not so bad.   Now and then, the buyer is some kind of obvious scam artist. That's a whole different post."
Etsy,36s1xx,baldylox,5,Fri May 22 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you! Great reviews really make my day. Also it correlates closely to repeat customers which are the best kind. I'm at about 1 in 4, but haven't gotten any in the last 6-7 sales. :-)"
Etsy,36s1xx,ces614,3,Thu May 21 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"37 Sales and 9 (five star) reviews.  Agreed tho, a good review kicks even more ass than a sale in my opinion. As for what I do to promote the reviews, well, I package up my prints as well as I can. I also include a printed note with a 10% discount code on it.  On top of that, my customer interaction is pretty much on the ball. I thank every order for purchasing from me. If I do a check up on an order that's not been delivered, I'll usually message the buyer to tell them roughly where it is - all my international stuff is sent as 'track and trace'.  I saw a packaging note the other day that read something like 'Thanks so much for ordering from me, please drop me a line to let me know you've received everything and that you're happy with your order' followed by contact details etc. I'm not using this at the moment, but I might well give it a bash."

Etsy,36szqh,saleina,2,Thu May 21 21:44:53 2015 UTC,Your items are pretty! I would suggest consistency in your photos in terms of brightness and contrast. I quite like how the photo is set up for your Copper Oak Tree of Life Pendant and the leaves really pop. The other photo thumbnails are not bright enough and don't do the item justice. Also be careful of shadows on the bottom half of your photos.  Your titles could use a lot more fluffing. You want to use up all the characters and make sure that key words in your title match tags you have.   I personally have not invested much time in instagram but I think if you instagrammed photos of the pendants in-progress that would be cool and probably be very popular.
Etsy,36szqh,swxw,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:47 2015 UTC,I will definitely work on the photos!   Thank you very much about the title advice...I'm awful when it comes to my tags/titles SEO
Etsy,36szqh,mortimusalexander,2,Fri May 22 15:01:37 2015 UTC,Maybe add an another picture to the listings to show scale in size. Example...place a quarter next to the pendants to give people an idea on how big they are.
Etsy,36szqh,Christypaints,1 point,Fri May 22 02:47:07 2015 UTC,I think that will be great :) Thank you I will definitely do that.

Etsy,36rvez,CircuitBreakerLabs,2,Thu May 21 20:07:26 2015 UTC,Definitely. Even when meeting in a public place I'll still opt to bring a buddy (preferably a guy). You can never be too safe in these types of situations.

Like I told another seller, this is incredibly wishy-washy. Hold a firm and clear stance.  I suggest that you read the Etsy Seller's Handbook on how to fill out your welcome and about page.  I would have square pictures so they fill up the page.  And someone else already told you that you're only selling infringing items, so take that as a warning that your shop can be closed at any moment, and you can be sued by the IP holder."

In my handmade shop a service I offer is to fill out a greeting card and send it directly to the recipient for the purchaser, if so desired.   I've since changed how the options work, but originally had a woman send me what she wanted on the inside with no other instruction. I sent her 3 messages in all, but just sent it to her unsealed because I had no idea what else/what name to write on the envelope or you know, WHERE she wanted me to send it to.  grinds teeth  Another issue that's been on my annoyance radar since I started are people trying to barter with me via messages. Now, I understand that vintage leads itself to thinking you can get it cheaper. Hell, bargaining isn't necessarily bad. But the issue is that I get messages without so much as a hello, but say 'can i get this for 12' No asking nicely, no punctuation, nothing. If you can't spend the time to ask about a coupon or something, I am not giving up my hard earned money to you. Nope. Unless I get a really nice conversation asking about any coupon codes or just being nice - I don't even give it a thought. But I make it a point to answer every single message I get.  Now some people would say to just ignore the rude messagers. Not I! I send them a message that says ""You're in luck! Here's an exclusive 10% off coupon, making your item $$$ before shipping."" I rarely hear anything back from the people, but it's not because I didn't respond. I feel like I take it back into my own hands. In the end 10% is easy for me to give up for a sale. But 50% is not. Killing people with kindness! :D Ha."
Etsy,36obln,JessicaAnnsEmporium,5,Wed May 20 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man I feel you!  You're better than I am about the responding thing.  Sometimes when I get messages that are riddled with poor grammar, rude, or just one sentence I won't even respond.  Also, can't for the life of me, understand why people expect you to give them deals on your handmade merchandise to begin with.  It's like they're entitled since it's vintage.  All they're entitled to is a foot of their asses.  I promise, when I first opened my shop I was the nicest person in the world... ALWAYS cutting deals, offering free thank you cards, etc.  However, it's made me jaded.  I hate that."
Etsy,36obln,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Wed May 20 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it takes patience. I just take a deep breath, and tell myself that this is ALWAYS better than retail in person. Always. And that stupid people need to buy things too. LOL.  Thanks for making me laugh. Foot in ass is something most people need every now and then! :D  It's hard to find people to talk to about this kind of stuff. I am jaded as well, but I try to stay positive. If I keep my standard at THIS level, then I'll be known for it. I know a lot of people give free things in each order, but I never have. I wrap everything in brown kraft paper and make it look nice. I respond immediately, and I do things quick. I try not to let myself think about how some days I have no sales, or that I had another person ask how this is a ""job"".  Just keep swimming. Don't allow yourself to be upset. You gotta look at the positive - you're doing something you love! (I hope!) That's why this subreddit is great - a nice place where other people understand and can relate. My parents don't even understand what I do. sigh"
Etsy,36obln,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Wed May 20 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"I get asked all the time why I keep doing it if I complain so much.  It's because I DO love what I do... I love the random messages I get about how cute my stuff is.  It validates the hard work that I put into things.  I used to let my customers walk all over me just to get a good review, and it's the main reason I put my shop on hold for an entire year.  It's been slow getting back into it, but I keep asking myself what happened to customers in the year I was away because they just seem worse to me now.  I put my foot down though on a lot, and I don't let anyone walk all over me anymore.  It's been really nice, to be honest.  My mom doesn't understand it either.  She thinks it's just a silly hobby.  I love having a safe place to vent my frustrations, but sometimes I'm worried a customer will see it and light my ass up over it, lol."
Etsy,36obln,DistressedOwl,1 point,Wed May 20 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you are sticking up for yourself. Boundaries are important. Being sane and getting a fair price is also important.  I'm sorry you had to leave; it can be draining. But I am happy to hear that you found your way back to what you love! I think the more etsy grows, the more people are flocking to the site. And from what I've gathered about life - there are a lot of... special? people out there.  Honestly, don't worry about negative comments or thoughts that could come from customers concerning your rants. A rational person/customer would understand all of your gripes. Obviously everything with moderation, but you're a smart cookie. Work on you rockstar, you!  (Did you share your shop? I would love to see it! If you don't want to share I understand.)"
Etsy,36obln,combustionbustion,4,Wed May 20 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I have digital downloads in my shop too, mostly clipart and graphics. My cousin has been urging me to start doing invites too, but I haven't wanted to because of EXACTLY this kind of thing. I like the way it is now, I only have to deal with a customer once or twice a week when they don't read the instructions or don't understand that you have to unzip the folder first. I think I will steer clear of invites a little longer, this is just reenforcing my reluctance."
Etsy,36obln,lovelyalone,1 point,Thu May 21 10:35:35 2015 UTC,"I don't want to talk you out of it! It isn't all bad experiences, believe me.i just think it's happening more frequently now for some reason. Etsy has always been popular, but lately it seems a whole new group of person is using the site.  I'm getting a lot of messages lately asking if I mail physical copies. It says in my shop description AND in the invitation description that no physical copy will be mailed. Customers don't understand that they could save themselves a lot of trouble if they just read those beforehand.  Overall, I love making invitations. I'd say go for it! At least try it out for a while and see how you like it."
Etsy,36obln,GoodVyybes,3,Thu May 21 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"My biggest one is people leaving you a less than five star rating with text like 'looks exactly like the photo, thanks seller!'  And even worse, when you go out of your way for that transaction. I just shipped something the DAY OF the transaction, when my shipping is 3-5 days, because the buyer needed them by the end of the week and didn't want to upgrade to priority shipping.  Then they four star me and say they love the items, and no mention of me going above and beyond for them. I just want to write them and say 'thanks a damn lot, dude.' I had just gotten up to a five star rating, but a few of these four stars have dropped me down to 4 1/2. Infuriating."
Etsy,36obln,GoodVyybes,1 point,Thu May 21 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I would have been furious. I'd rather them not even leave a rating if it's something like that. That's how I became so jaded I think... Going above and beyond, turning around orders in way less than what is expected without an upgraded rush fee, and then a response that just says something generic. I don't do it for the reviews, but it would be nice if people would take other people into consideration. I couldn't imagine dealing with actually sending physical items."
Etsy,36obln,sandusky-s,2,Thu May 21 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"lately - not sure why - I have had quite a few customers who request a custom order of a specific item in my shop - put all the personalization details in the box and submit and think they actually purchased the item! I had quite a lengthy conversation/argument with some lady just yesterday, who insisted that she actually bought the listing - NO, you requested a custom order!!! ugh! she wouldn't listen!"
Etsy,36obln,midlifecrackers,2,Fri May 22 00:57:06 2015 UTC,"My biggest pet peeves-  1. People leaving negative reviews because USPS took a long time to get their order to them. I've had orders shipped 3 days after they were ordered, get scanned in at the post office then just disappear for a week and a half. Buyers ALWAYS take it out on me, even though if I were to do anything to figure out where it is, the most I can do is call USPS, wait for an hour for an actual person to get on the phone then just be told where it was scanned last. I usually reassure them that the item is ""in transit"" and not just marked as shipped then never sent out since it was scanned as accepted at the post office 3 days after they ordered it and that it isn't uncommon for packages to show up a week or two later (especially since I ship some of my items in pretty small packages.) The packages almost always show up, but if it's been more than a couple weeks with no activity I'll just issue a refund.  2. Girls asking for free products to review it on their blog, YouTube, Instagram, tumblr, etc. Would it ever be acceptable to walk into a boutique and ask the shop owner for a bunch of free stuff to talk about on your blog so people somewhere might spend money at their store while you flash your Instagram followers in their face? Hopefully not, since that would not only be extremely rude, selfish and conceited all at the same time (why would anyone feel like they shouldn't have to buy things like everyone else just because they have a popular blog? Wouldn't reviews for products they don't have to pay for be pretty biased anyway?) 3. People asking where I get my supplies to make my products. Just super annoying. Again, no one would really ask regular stores questions like that.  4. People misunderstanding my policies because they didn't read it all then getting upset at me. I seriously tried to make my policies as clear as I possibly could. This is in the bottom of all my items: Orders typically SHIP within 3-5 business days. This doesn't mean you will receive your item(s) in 3-5 days. Depending on your location, orders within the country are usually received anywhere between 3-14 days after being placed. Once the item is shipped, I have no control over the speed of delivery. Orders outside of the United States are usually received 2-4 weeks after being placed. I've still had people in other countries message me upset because they hadn't received their order 3 days after they placed it. I just. I can't."
Etsy,36obln,nomorealexis,1 point,Mon May 25 04:25:36 2015 UTC,"People misunderstanding my policies because they didn't read it all then getting upset at me.    SO.MUCH.THIS.  It's just laziness.  Pure laziness.  Why read the shop description when you can just message the owner your questions?  Here's the thing, and I know it's poor customer service.  BUT, if you message me just to ask a question that is CLEARLY outlined in my shop description... I will NOT respond to you.  OR, if I do respond, it's usually 4 days later, and the response will most likely said ""Per my shop description...""  Seriously, I can't stand that shit.  I always read shop descriptions... it seems like a no brainer to me.  Of course the world would be too easy if that actually happened the way it was meant to.  I am seriously glad that I don't ship actual items.  Honestly, I thought about buying a professional printer, printing them off and mailing them out.  However, I don't want to deal with the headache of shipping items.  There are just so many variables you have to deal with, so for me it's just easier to offer a printable instead of a physical item.  Which, is also outlined in my shop description and yet I still get a million messages a week asking if I ship directly and why not when I say no."
Etsy,36obln,LWdkw,2,Mon May 25 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"There are certain things I won't respond to, like ""Where do you get your charms to make your necklaces??"" I've spent a ton of time searching for the best places to buy my supplies, why would I tell people so they can buy them from other places? Would it be okay to ask a bakery for their recipes?? I've dealt with the most ridiculous people. One girl a state away from me was livid when she didn't receive her order THE NEXT DAY and said that she expected overnight shipping because the price for shipping was ""ridiculous"" when she ordered 2 thick sweaters and a flannel shirt and the shipping was $10. I tried to politely explain that shipping price is based on weight, not distance, and expedited shipping was an option but she selected the standard method. I then sent her a receipt for the actual shipping I paid for, which was 11 cents less than what she paid. I told her I'd refund her the 11 cents, but she thought I was being rude and freaked out. Then she got her sister to message me. It was insane."
Etsy,36pho4,PandaSlanda,2,Thu May 21 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"On first look you mention a lot of negative things in your policies. (Something not being a high enough quality, not being able to ship for free, etc.) - don't highlight that! haha. You sound like you're apologizing before you did anything wrong!   I know it might seem harsh, but try to write those as formal as possible as to let customers find what they are looking for asap. Then if it sounds too business-like, you can add some personal touches back in.  I do think your photos are okay, but could be improved upon. Also is there a story behind why your store is called Rye Candles? You should make an about page.  Read some about pages, policy pages, and tags for shops that are similar. Your tags and titles could be improved upon significantly.   Hang in there and work on something for your shop every day. It took me 6 months before I sold anything - so you're doing okay! :)"
Etsy,36pho4,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Thu May 21 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Also, because I commented too quickly - I clicked a candle at random. For Pink Magnolia - I don't know what a Magnolia smells like. You have to make me want this candle! What flavorful words can you use to put me in a room with that candle? Set up a scene in your description and tell me why I need this smell in my house!   There are a lot of people with candles, you need to work it girl! Make me believe that I can't live without the breeze coming in and getting a huge inhale of this scent! Is it for ladies? Men? Teens? Is it calming? Make me energized? What about holidays? Is it perfect for a summer cookout? Lazy day on the porch?  Hope this helps!"
Etsy,36pho4,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Thu May 21 02:43:00 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! Your ideas help a lot so I'll get right on making those improvements you suggested! :D I really appreciate it!

Etsy,36pho4,jellybonezzz,2,Thu May 21 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think you could really benefit from taking photos on a clean, white background. I have been using 2 pieces of white basic poster board from the dollar store/any craft store that work SO well. it really just helps to highlight the item, and give you a clean look that will be the same in every photo.   once you take new photos, raise your prices. you need to be more confident in your product! don't just charge what it costs to produce that actual item... look for what other high end candle companies are charging ie: any of the candles that anthropolgie sells."

Etsy,36ofh3,shillyshally,3,Wed May 20 21:42:49 2015 UTC,"Just happened to see your post on my front page. Don't know anything about Etsy.  Google, a few weeks ago now or maybe longer, has started to try and monitize (make money from) it's search results listings.  If there's any saleable item that you search often, you may have noticed a change in the first page of search results a few weeks ago as the policy was implimented.  I don't know the details, but basically if Google makes money through your store in some way... such as your buying advertising from them... then you're place in the searches rises.  For many things I used to search, the first page is now almost worthless. I always click through to page 2 of the results.  HTH ... if in no other way than to let you know you aren't crazy and you may want to go get better information than I have."

Etsy,36ofh3,giantslor,1 point,Wed May 20 23:48:36 2015 UTC,Why would anyone be surprised at a cost cutting measure like reducing the amount of money they pay for product listing ads? The sad part is there's no way to independently pay for Google  product listing ads separate from etsy.
Etsy,36ofh3,skunkhaus,3,Wed May 20 22:26:16 2015 UTC,"Nearly accurate, but not 100% true.  You can do it if you have your own top-level URL (your own website)."
Etsy,36ofh3,giantslor,2,Wed May 20 23:35:44 2015 UTC,Umm... don't you need a continually updating data feed from your store? I couldn't find a reliable source for one.  I love how someone always pops up with a counterpoint that depends on a small technicality. Everyone here views etsy through rose colored glasses when in reality an etsy storefront is a shit product.
Etsy,36ofh3,skunkhaus,1 point,Thu May 21 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"For small merchants the data feed can be as simple as a text file submitted to google.  It doesn't take wizardry, just initiative.  Not that I'm recommending it, I'm just saying it's possible."

Etsy,36n4h2,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Wed May 20 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Haha! Probably. I've just had the same thing for the last 3-4 years and I like to keep things from going stale.
Etsy,36n4h2,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Wed May 20 17:21:26 2015 UTC,Good thought - it's never a bad thing to revisit your past choices. I love your shop - and congrats on all of those sales!
Etsy,36n4h2,trinaluna,3,Wed May 20 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"Cool items :). I think your current packaging is clever. I prefer the black box over white. If you could source them to be economical, a black box printed with your business name in gold/silver placed in the bottom left or right corner would look really chic. If printing is too expensive, try hand stamping them. You could try getting a similar look with some quality labels, but if not executed quite right it could look cheap. Idk, I'm funny about labels :P"
Etsy,36n4h2,nikstwosticks,3,Wed May 20 16:49:46 2015 UTC,I really like your current packaging.
Etsy,36n4h2,randomlygen,2,Wed May 20 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love your current packaging."
Etsy,36n4h2,sneaky_dragon,2,Wed May 20 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"If you could get your boxes engraved with your business name/logo or do it yourself, that would add some nice branding.  I would be fine with a label sticker on the front of a black box as well. But make sure the sticker quality is in line with the elegance of your packaging.  And I would prefer a black box over white."
Etsy,36n4h2,throwaway502502,2,Wed May 20 19:58:38 2015 UTC,Is it possible to get boxes (Or lids?) with a circuit board like design on it? That would be awesome!
Etsy,36n4h2,littletinypiranha,1 point,Wed May 20 20:43:46 2015 UTC,That would be pretty snazzy!
Etsy,36n4h2,underthetootsierolls,2,Wed May 20 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty clean and crisp already. I can't really tell from the photo if the green paper strip is just printed but maybe you can get the paper embossed instead so it has a nice raised texture, kind of like a real circuit board. Whether or not you the paper strip is all the same colour with just texture can be up to you and how simple you want it.   For the box, I generally would prefer black over white but I prefer kraft boxes over shiny boxes. Maybe you could look into those?"
Etsy,36n4h2,airjam21,2,Thu May 21 03:34:46 2015 UTC,"What if you use a round sticker with the circut board design printed full bleed. You can buy sheets of the stickers, and print them using the same pattern you are using on the belly band you currently have on the boxes. The circle could even become your logo above the text, and it mimics the circles in your work.   Edit: round sticker goes on top of the box, not on side as a seal."

Etsy,36n4h2,affinityxxxx,1 point,Wed May 20 16:47:15 2015 UTC,I've seen circuit board washi tape. That would be a neater upgrade from paper.
Etsy,36n4h2,kazuri85,2,Wed May 20 17:14:42 2015 UTC,I've seen that too. I like that idea. I though about buying some a while ago but didn't know what to do with it. Washi tape is so etsy ;)
Etsy,36n4h2,affinityxxxx,2,Wed May 20 17:22:20 2015 UTC,I have to respectfully disagree. I don't think washi tape is classy at all. It looks cheap and her jewelry doesn't speak cheap to me.
Etsy,36n4h2,ronchamps,1 point,Wed May 20 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"Your current packaging is really cool. If anything you might consider slightly different paper or something(but it doesn't look necessary from the pics, but that is the type of thing that helps to see in person)"

Etsy,36matc,BansheeCrafts,8,Wed May 20 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"I really love your stuff. I think you are very talented. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but your shop is too personal. It makes me a bit uncomfortable. For instance:    And our team mentor would inappropriately interfere in the work. I was too green back then to face her or the world and everything became more of a chore then anything joyful. So I quit and it all fell into oblivion.    It's unfortunate that someone was not supportive of you along the way, but as someone who doesn't know you it seems a bit gossipy and reflects badly on you.  This makes me wonder if you are going to drop the ball on shipping:   love implementing glass and metal in my pieces, there's so many ideas....and so little time, since just like everyone else, I have a lot of handywork outside of etsy   You don't want to give buyers the idea that you will be too busy and disorganized to get their stuff out.  Linking to your shop's facebook page is fine (I do this myself), but I would definitely not post the link to your personal facebook page. Again, just too personal.  Your shop is a business. Personal information makes buyers uncomfortable. As much as I like your work, I would be hesitant to order from you. I would strongly suggest depersonalizing your store and focusing more on your techniques in the ""about"" section. Additionally, I would strongly suggest limiting your use of emoticons and checking over your grammar (for instance you sometimes use the word ""then"" when it should be ""than""). You wouldn't think that these issues would have any impact on sales, but they really do. You need to cultivate a more professional profile. When buyers see a professional profile, they believe they will get a professional product. The converse applies for an unprofessional profile. And absolutely raise your prices. Good luck!"
Etsy,36matc,k80k80k80,4,Wed May 20 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"Huh. Maybe you could tuck a little comment in your about page about donating? Hardcore shoppers interested in your ""story"" check the about page and would love to hear about your intentions.   I'd say run your business as usual. Price appropriately to earn profit. I think buyers on etsy either know what they're looking for (quality, handmade, artisan items) or have never been on etsy and treat it like some large, anonymous retailer and will bargain hunt. Market your shop so that you're getting the buyers you want. If you want the artisan shoppers, price accordingly. In some cases shoppers will not purchase if the price is too low because they will assume the product is of lesser quality or not handmade. If you set prices too low trying to market a quality product, you'll also end up watering down the quality of offerings from similar artists.  I started selling with low prices thinking nobody wanted to purchase my silly circuit board necklaces. I discovered after years of tinkering that as I raised prices, I continued to sell more and more. There's an inherent value associated with higher prices as well, so you can use that to your advantage (or at least make a reasonable wage).   EDIT: I took a look at your shop. Nice jewelry! I'd say from looking at it that you're undercharging. Your work is gorgeous and detailed. I don't see why buyers wouldn't be willing to pay nearly double what you're charging. I think having more items for sale will really help as well. With pretty items like yours, buyers will want to browse around."
Etsy,36matc,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Wed May 20 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"I have a variety of prices in my shop and that works well for me. I have some simpler pieces that go for under $30 and some go all the way up over $200. I think you are right to be wary of going too cheap and then having to work yourself into a coma to make any money. Some people who might ""advise"" you have no idea what it takes to make an item from hand and you'll never be able to compete with .25 cents an hour labor so I would recommend you not even try. The people you want to sell to can tell quality and will be return buyers. I took a look and I think your prices are too low. Some might think that these are manufactured because they are priced so inexpensively. You have beautiful things! Good luck! Oh, also I'd mention the donation thing. I wouldn't think that you were less than sincere if I saw that in your shop description :-)"
Etsy,36matc,ces614,1 point,Wed May 20 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"Wow. I'd say the vast majority of these are way underpriced. Unless every little leaf and tendril came pre-made (which I know it didn't), you're prices are too low. That's not even factoring in time spent taking photos, making listings, cost of materials and fees. I am confused as to why this, which looks simpler, costs 50% more than this, which is incredibly intricate and looks like it took ages and an surgeon's hand. That should be $30+ in my opinion. Don't devalue your work by pricing it in the $10-20 sweatshop import range. Seriously, people who glue vintage buttons to pre-made posts and call it ""handmade earrings"" charge around that range. If you want to make tiny, simple items in that price range in addition to your current inventory, that might be a good idea."
Etsy,36matc,poxteeth,1 point,Wed May 20 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"Your prices are WAY to low. Those cuff bracelets I would expect to see in the $100-$200 range. Maybe more. If you haven't already, read about different pricing methods. Decide what to pay yourself hourly, determine how much supplies cost for each piece and how much time you spend building each thing and then come up with a factor by which you mark up all those costs. Don't forget to include things like packaging materials, printer ink, electricity..anything you use to build your items counts. If you aren't comfortable being paid a reasonable wage (there is nothing wrong with making money for your time and efforts) then just lump it all together to make a bigger donation to your cause.   I agree with what others have said about trying to limit the amount of personal information. Don't over share as it can actually have a negative impact. As a general rule, because I know they can read a bit unprofessional, I try not to use emoticons until a customer uses them first in an message or something. They connote a sense of familiarity that some people find inappropriate in a business setting. Obviously lots of people dont care, but those people aren't going to be upset if you DONT use them. But do mention your charity.   Lastly, While I don't think the best place to share is in the about page for your shop, I think you should consider writing a blog or a newsletter about you items, processes, experiences and goals. It would be great promo for your shop. Your writing has nice flow. It is personable. And you're passionate. It would be great promo for your shop, great updates for people who choose to purchase from you and contribute to your cause, and I think you would be good at it."
Etsy,36matc,hi_bye,1 point,Thu May 21 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"Long story short, if you if price it like a mass produced item, people will assume it's massed produced.   With that said, you should definitely raise your prices appropriately but also include some lower priced (maybe smaller) items so people aren't scared away by everything being expensive.   Your items are very lovely, good luck :)"
Etsy,36matc,littletinypiranha,1 point,Thu May 21 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Big thanks to all of you! I read everything and implemented some changes. It's good to see things from another perspective.  k80k80k80 Thank you, I appreciate it, I never looked at it that way... now about the truth, Taken out of contest it does sound very bad now that I see it, gosh....however the point of it was to show that I kept on doing things my way even many years later. Hmm at the end of that second sentence I wrote ''Those cats aren't gonna pat themselves'' so it was  more of a joke and I assumed somehow that only means that there are more new things to come, but yes, I see what u meant so i Removed it. I keep forgetting these are web waters where people don't know me and vice versa. I was selling locally and people either knew me or someone told them about me so they knew I was trustworthy, and they were always questioning all the details so I figured....why not. Now I see WHY NOT lol, thanks.  Not sure how people that are not organised run their shops because customers can report their shops, give bad reviews, I assume they get refunds. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I wasn't organised and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I impaired anyone's order. But yes, people can't know that so I have to remove those silly stories. Thanks once again.  CircuitBreakerLabs Thanks! Hmmm I see your point, yes. Artisan shoppers...and I definitely plan on adding much more items   ces614 Manufactured, ugh, you're right, never thought of that either, thanks for pointing it out  poxteeth Thank you, I see your point. And a mistake I made. It took me maybe 3 hours to make that floral brooch, but it took much more to make that tree, gradient background and tree is made like....a mosaic? Not sure how to explain this properly in English, but I assembled the tree from many little pieces, I didn't make ''snakes''  of clay and then drew indentations in it. I was twisting snakes until they broke and many lines appeared. Hope that explains it. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me!  hi_bye, littletinypiranha, sneaky_dragon and everyone else regarding the prices this is my biggest problem I believe:  Since I live in Croatia where average monthly paycheck is 400$, as well as in surrounding countries, I know no one would be buying my jewelry here because we just...can't. And I do sell locally still. It seems way too much to price my cuff bracelets as high as 100-200$, but I really wouldn't know, they do take me 6-8 non stop hours to make. I'm not sure how things are going out there in the world so I just went with this... Here's an example, Lacrimosa pendant 11$ - which is 74kn, it took 10kn of materials (fimo, glass), and 4kn packaging, which is all together 2$ to make it, electricity, baking....plus it took me 3 hours to make it (not sure how but it did), so 11 seemed as a fine price. I'm struggling with this because when I use formulas for setting up prices they seem....fine, but I count in my own currency, so...really not sure what to do, my brain just freezes regarding this price issues because I'm questioning so many variables.  I will re-read all your comments again and give my best to come up with something.  Thank you all once again for taking your time to reply, I really appreciate it."

It makes me think of a waiter that chases you out of the restaurant to ask why you didn't leave a bigger tip. 4 stars is still a good feedback rating, and I kind of feel like a lot of sellers are too fixated on having all 5 stars.   A lot of people only give out 5 stars if they're blown away by a product or service. Some people virtually never give out 5 star feedback."

If that's really what it costs, put that as the price. Let people decide, they may be perfectly willing to buy it still."

What others I knew did since we were close to the border, was go out once a week to the US and mail packages. Outline on your page that you ship only once a week or whatever.  Otherwise, maybe doing smaller prints would drop the cost? Admittedly, that's pretty crazy of a price, see if you can cut down on packaging or make it less of an irregular size? I'm pretty sure I've fedex paper documents for not that bad of a price out of Canada."

Etsy,36jqfn,mandanastudios,2,Wed May 20 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"It might just be due to international fees and things.

I think Etsy has a shipping calculator, too, so that might help you find cheaper prices/understand international shipping price ranges better."
Etsy,36jqfn,Christypaints,2,Tue May 19 22:35:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for you reply!  I have been to both UPS and Canada Post and compared prices. However they seem to only be a few dollars difference.   While researching other Canadian shops I see that some are offering  national shipping for $3.95+ while others are offering FREE shipping.

Etsy,36jqfn,Christypaints,4,Tue May 19 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"People that are offering free shipping are just adding the cost of shipping to their items, most likely. It seems really unlikely that a seller would just eat the cost of shipping something they are trying to make money on."

For example, if you could fit it within the oversized letter post size, you can send it nationally for only a few dollars. For international parcels, you can easily send it for as cheap as $5 to the US and around $10 for other international destinations. Do your prints qualify as a paper product? Maybe you can send them as post internationally too but that usually means no tracking/insurance. The key is to figure out what the limits are for each price bracket and try to get your product to fit that. You can refer to the Canada Post counter price PDF for more info."

Compare prices for shipping leter size and legal size, vs. the tabloid size you are currently shipping.  It might be worth reducing your print size if it significantly drops your shipping costs.  Use a thinner protective insert. Here in the states, there is a huge price difference between a rigid mailing and a non-rigid mailing. It has to do with if your package can go through the auto sort machines.  I use file folders to protect my decals, it add just enough stiffness to protect, without making them so stiff the machines can't process them."

Etsy,36j9ha,Scrubwaydick,9,Tue May 19 20:11:38 2015 UTC,"Chris, it's really hard to tell someone about their prices. You are in a vintage shop so you know what you paid. And if you check on other sites, like Ebay, you can see what they have previously sold for.  Your policies are fair. I feel it's worded a bit awkwardly. I simply say, ""If you are unhappy with any merchandise, please convo me. I am sure we can work something out."" Basically what you've said, but a bit friendlier. I haven't given a refund so far, so I don't think it's something that will get abused.  I love your silver spoons so I looked at that listing for the critique. I feel you should put more hard information in the listing. How many are there. I can count to 6, but it would be nice to see it spelled out. How long are they? How wide are they? Do they have any markings? How big is the box? Is this the original box as far as you know? Can you find out what stones they are? I think the pink one is Rose quartz. It would be nice if you could give the gems names.   I wouldn't add that most you've seen are in far worse condition. If someone on Etsy comes across your listing they are in it for the stones or the spoons, not to comparison shop.   You say in your listing you've researched them. It might be interesting, if you know, what they were designed for, or who sold them. It reminds me of something that might have been in The Pyramid Collection (it's an online store) that sells new age stuff.  About your eyeglasses, I wouldn't put that you found them at an estate sale and you think someone might like them. It's off-putting, esp for the price, like you're a ""Flipper"" (okay, you are) instead you want to look like a Curator of Fine Vintage Products (what we'd prefer to believe). I don't mean this in a bad way, just that your description should be more on the product than on where you found it. Unless you found it at Woody Allen's estate sale or somewhere fairly impressive.  I read your about page and it's very obvious you're an ebay seller. I don't mean that in a bad way, but Etsy is a very different place. It's like the difference between McDonald's and fancy french restaurant.   Don't tell people to make an offer if they can't afford it, please don't tell them you're not the best researcher. Present yourself as a professional and you'll be treated as one. I love the suit, it's a great touch.  People on Etsy are much more willing to not quibble over prices. Unlike Ebay, they don't seem to mind as much paying for shipping. To sell on Etsy you really should try to research more.   I hope this doesn't sound too harsh. I'm just trying to help.   Good luck!"
Etsy,36j9ha,sirius_moonlight,2,Tue May 19 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Hey! Can I bug you to explain the curator bit? I actually also just opened a vintage shop and am... well, a bit obsessive about ""getting it right"" with building our brand etc. We sell mostly china right now, but will be moving into other goods.  Anyway, could you explain the curator bit if you have a minute?"
Etsy,36j9ha,Megnanimous,3,Wed May 20 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"Your about page looks really nice, but I'd just take out this sentence, it's the first one in the 2nd paragraph: We find all of our pieces by searching carefully in thrift stores, antique malls, yard sales and more.   You don't need to tell people where you get your items. It may just be me, but then it sounds more money making (yes we do that) than a genuine love of antiques, which you really do a good job of describing in the first paragraph.  The reason I say this is that I do 'flip' a lot of things (ebay) and I talk with people who do (esp from Ebay). I've heard a lot that people can get irritated if you find a $2 trinket at Goodwill and sell it for $200 (it's actual worth). I always try to play up the good parts of the item without coming out and saying, ""and I got it at goodwill."" It sort of cheapens your work.   I checked out your descriptions and they look very nice, esp the plates. It looks like you really know you stuff. On the Vegetable bowl and sugar bowl you don't say how big it is. It's best if you put the dimensions in so a customer doesn't think it was bigger/smaller than expected.  You state your sugar bowl has a small nick. I believe you can see it in picture 3. I like to tell people which picture has the nick so they give it a good look.  Your return policy sounds nice and your pictures are very professional. Good luck!"
Etsy,36j9ha,sirius_moonlight,2,Wed May 20 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot!  I'll take out the bit about where we find our goods for sure. It makes a ton of sense.   I went through our listings today and fixed a ton of the tags and that alone changed our organic traffic, so when I get home I'll go through and do the size descriptions etc.   I very much like the idea of presenting as a curator rather than a flipper. Everything we sell is literally something we saw and were just in love with. I'm very glad it sounds like I know my stuff! I'm still learning (which is why we don't have clothes up yet,  I know zip about them) but I'm very keen on being accurate.   Thank you a ton for looking, and for the well wishes!"
Etsy,36j9ha,Megnanimous,1 point,Wed May 20 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"Hey thank you so much, your advice is really clicks with me and I could not agree more, I sincerely appreciate it!  I am heading out to do some errands right now, but will definitely improve my page, and listings after I get back.  How should I go about looking up the stones? Just Google the color and add precious/semi precious stones or try and find someone who sold the exact thing? (I figure that might be a little more difficult and possibly misleading.)"
Etsy,36j9ha,CircuitBreakerLabs,2,Tue May 19 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"If you just say, ""the stones are unidentified, but they could be X, Y, and Z"", I think that would be a way to add more information without being misleading.   It's a little tricky to tell from the photos what the stones are, but I agree the pink one is probably rose quartz. The green ones may be aventurine, and the orange one might be agate. The purple could be amethyst (is that purple or pink?)."
Etsy,36j9ha,sirius_moonlight,1 point,Tue May 19 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"If there is a store around you that sells these types of stones you could look there, maybe even take them with you. Michaels and Pat Catan's often have these types of stones. Either as stones or as beads.  I sort of agree with CircuitBreakerLabs you have to be careful, but if you get the real stone (not just an image) it should be easier for you to identify. Jasper can sometimes be tricky."
Etsy,36j9ha,CircuitBreakerLabs,1 point,Tue May 19 23:32:37 2015 UTC,"Woohoo!   Few comments I can think of:  List more stuff! Buyers like to browse. The more there is to see, the longer they'll stay and the more likely they will be to make a purchase.   Give sizes or provide something in the photo to use as a size reference. When listing sizes, provide units (is 10 x 24 in inches? Actually the other listing has units in ft so I assume ft? Don’t make buyers assume anything)  Use all 5 photos. Make sure they're clear and crisp. (i.e. I can't tell what the photography backdrop is. Is is the stippled part or the brown part or both?)  Use EVERY tag. It's annoying but it increases the chance of a search hit.   One listing says it comes with a case. Show a photo of that case.   Basically, answer all questions a buyer could have in your descriptions. Don't make them ask you. Buyers (in my experience) won't stick around to ask questions.   Also, fill out your shop announcement, even if it's redundant to your about page.  I would beef up titles just a bit. Include some keywords like colors since titles are also used to pull search results (the first 100 or 140 characters maybe? Something like that).   Otherwise, good start, and good luck!"

Etsy,36j9ha,midlifecrackers,1 point,Tue May 19 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely use more of the tags for materials! The stones in the spoons are: amethyst, rose quartz, carnelian agate, aventurine, bloodstone, and (i think) chalcedony. They're all semi-precious gems and have not a ton of value, but someone will love em. Make sure to use all of the gem names in your tags! People will find you easier that way. Also i am almost positive that is not silver, i'd be very careful tagging that silver unless you know. Someone is gonna make trouble about that if they are sold. I'd just list them as vintage metal or soemthing.  Those glasses are gonna sell fast, add a bit more description to them and maybe clean up the photo a bit or something, and they'll go. Best of luck!"
Etsy,36j9ha,midlifecrackers,1 point,Wed May 20 00:10:53 2015 UTC,"Am I asking too much for the glasses?  And sorry my friend had one once, looked exactly like them and he told me they are silver plated. They are not marked so, I guess you may be correct."
Etsy,36j9ha,bababby,1 point,Wed May 20 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"No worries! I recently retired from 22 yrs in the jewelry business, i've seen exact sets like this. If it were silver it'd have a different color- more white, less of that hard gray metal lustre.  The glasses... 12k gold filled... (that's what the gf stands for, it's basically a thick gold plating)... sweet design... i'd up those suckers to maybe $120 or thereabouts. BUT- if you do that, do an etsy search for vintage eyeglass frames and try to maybe emulate their photo style somewhat. Maybe even do one model shot of them- on your own face or a friend. Showing a piece being used is an excellent way to add value to a buyer.  And use similar tags to what the other sellers are using, you'll get found faster.   Also those photo backdrop things you have... i honestly cant' even tell what i'm looking at in your pics. Not trying to be rude, maybe someone who buys those types of things will have more familiarity with them?  Here's my #1 piece of advice after selling on etsy for a few years: remember that the shoppers have never seen what you are selling. YOU can see it, they can't. You have to make that header photo the absolute best that you possibly can. No background clutter, use good lighting (natural light is best), and have the piece be instantly recognizable."
Etsy,36ii81,g33kch1c,4,Tue May 19 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"First, join the facebook group Craft Fair Show and Tell.  They have a great FAQ that answers most of your questions, has lots of pictures and display ideas, and very experienced show-goers to give advice.   Do a variety of products, but make it cohesive.  If it's just a bunch of random stuff, it looks like a junk shop or garage sale.  You can get away with more variety if you display ""like"" items together. If you have a variety within one area (like lots of different types of decals and mugs) you'll likely appeal to more customers than if you only have a couple of different designs of a whole bunch of different products. It greatly depends on the area and show, but I think your prices are fine.  You might also consider doing ""buy 4 get 1 free"" kind of deals.  If you were selling higher priced items (like wood signs) I'd also suggest having some lower price point items.  The profit might be smaller on those items, but it adds up and draws people in to look and maybe also get something bigger.   With Square and PayPal they will refund you the $10 once you activate your account! You can buy a reader at Staples or Walmart or wherever, and then they'll credit it back to your account. I've used both, as well as the Etsy reader.  I like Square the most (it has been most reliable and I prefer the percent fee as opposed to per transaction).  With Etsy, though, if you process it as an item from your shop you'll be adding to your order count, which is nice.  You get charged that $0.20 fee still, though, so you would have to decide if it is worth it (especially since you're selling smaller items).  From the sounds of it, I'd do Square.  Plus: If you sign up for Square through this link you get the first $1000 of transactions fee free. Bring as much as you have time and money to make.  What you don't bring, you can't sell!  It's better to have extra to replenish what is purchased so that your booth is full, and you can always post it on etsy or take it to the next show! I have a photo album of custom order options and past projects for people to look through.  You can do custom orders through your card reader to email receipts/your info.  Have a sign that says ""YES! I do custom orders!"" or ""Create your own custom design!"" or something along those lines.  I will say, though, that it's also important to have a wide range of ready-to-take items because people like to shop farmers markets for instant gratification ;)  Older folks can also tend to be skeptical of paying for something they don't have in-hand. I've had about 2 people ask for a paper receipt, and maybe 10 want an emailed receipt.  You can get a $5 receipt book from Staples or Amazon if you'd like, but making your own would be fine too.  Few people will want one, though.  Your card reader can also do a email or text receipt.  I just ask ""Would you like a receipt emailed to you?"" and most people say no.  You can go a few different routes for packaging.  You can get away with using old shopping bags if you emphasize that you are ""green"" and trying to recycle ;)  What I chose to do is get recycled kraft brown shopping bags, then stamped my logo on them with a stamp I had made through Vistaprint.  You can get TONS of different types of bags through Uline or Amazon.  I think it's worth it to have something nice for people to put their stuff in.  The little fabric tote idea is a good idea too-  you could offer gift wrapping options, too. Absolutely have business cards, and bring more than you think you need! I got mine from tinyprints.com and I love them, but there are lots of places you can order from.  I have a sign that says something along the lines of ""Find us on Etsy, Instagram, and Facebook!"" with an arrow pointing down to where my business cards are.  You should also have a banner with at least your shop name and tagline (related to what you sell-  ""unique gifts and home decor"" or whatever).  You can also get good banners from Vistaprint. I have a sign that says I accept cards and cash.  I've never had anyone ask about checks.  I think most people know to bring cash to shopping events like this. If they don't have cash, they'll at least have a card.     A few other things:  Set up a practice display about a week before your event to make sure it looks the way you need to, if you need more inventory or to change your set up... Once it's how you want it, take a picture to help you set it up the day of.  If you joint that craft fair group I posted you can post your picture and people will give fantastic constructive criticism!  Tablecloth to the floor!  If you can see junk and boxes under your table, it pretty much ruins the whole display.   People notice your display before they notice your products.  It's important to make a good first impression so that people will come look!  If you have a rough first show, don't fret!  You'll learn and improve as you get more experience.  If you want to order business cards, flyers, or a banner, Groupon often has a Vistaprint deal to pay $27 for $70 worth of product.  It's the best deal out there!  Any other questions, let me know!  Edit: Just for fun, this is my most recent setup"

Etsy,36ii81,honeycombhive,3,Tue May 19 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"Credit cards.. I have been reading up on the Square. Would it be worth it to purchase and bring? It looks like it's only about $10 with a 2.75% fee. I use Paypal and I know they have a thing, too. Preference?   You can get a Square reader for free through their website.  Etsy also has a free reader and so does PayPal.  It's absolutely worth it in my opinion.  As a buyer I never carry cash; as a seller it's an easy way to track my sales and send receipts (taking care of #6 - you can track cash through the app too, and send that receipt).   I want to offer custom orders to be mailed or arranged for a pickup. Would I just put up a sign/inform customers when they come? List images of what I can do and let them know that custom orders are available and actually something I love to do?   I don't know much about your booth but maybe you can make a cute sign indicating you accept custom orders?   Packaging.. I have a ton of old walmart bags. Are those acceptable to use? Should I get nicer looking bags? I assume I'll need something like newspaper to wrap my mugs in. I also sew.. I could make some of those little totes available to purchase.. maybe like $2 with an item..or something? For the decals.. I was thinking some of the smaller ""treat"" bags.. would that be acceptable? They're usually really cheap.   Check out Amazon or a packaging place like Uline or Nashville Wraps for packaging.  However, it's a farmer's market, most people bring reusable bags!   Business cards.. important to bring? I haven't purchased any yet but they're on my to do list. I also have a website. Would a sign somewhere be acceptable to say something about Facebook/Etsy/Website or should I bring the business cards?   The nice thing about business cards is you aren't relying on customer memory for sales once the market is over.  Check out Vistaprint - you could order 50-100 for a pretty reasonable amount and see how it goes.  Good luck!"

Your prices seem fine to me, maybe even a little low.  3.) I just use the option to type in credit card numbers on my phone through etsy (no reader).  From working with non profits and going to the farmer's market every week just taking cash seems reasonable.  4.) I would bring everything and see what sells.  5.) I would mention it and have something available to take orders.  I do all of my orders through etsy that way I can ask the customer to pay in advance so I don't waste time or money on materials and they have a way to get their money back if I don't deliver.  6.) In my experience people only want receipts if they give you a credit card but you can get a cheap receipt book with carbon copy at staples.  I have one that  I have used 0 times.  7.) Have bags but most people don't care if they are pretty.  If you get some nicer ones with your name on them it helps advertise.  Definitely make bags for people to buy.  I am forever forgetting my market bags at home and need to find something once I get there.  8.) Definitely - if you have a decent printer you can do them at home or order some super cheap online.  9.)  I  have not had a problem with checks.  If it bounces all you can do is call the person and try to get them to pay you or get in touch with a collection agency which can get pricey.  Either way - if you can, cash the check at their bank.  Most banks will charge you a fee if you deposit a check and it bounces.  Good luck!"

Etsy,36iejf,goodbyereckless,9,Tue May 19 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but in my research, color combos are not off-limits, but when you tag or title with a trademarked/copywrited property then you are infringing.   House color bandanas, sure! Harry Potter in tags, definitely not. House names, questionable since it is piggybacking on someone else's work. Taking the high (and lawful) road does mean less exposure in HP specific searches but it's worth it not to lose your whole business and be screwed in costly lawsuits.   This is as far as I know and I could be wrong so take my advice with a grain of salt. You'll have to speak with someone more knowledgeable about IP laws."
Etsy,36iejf,nikstwosticks,1 point,Tue May 19 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"I thought this might be the case! Maybe I can find a way to make it work. I definitely don't want to risk anything. There are plenty of items on Etsy that are much more obviously HP themed (using crests, etc.) than anything I'd be doing, but that definitely still doesn't make it OK, if it is indeed a violation of copyright."
Etsy,36iejf,nikstwosticks,4,Tue May 19 17:39:13 2015 UTC,It is certainly tempting when you see others do it much more blatantly and seemingly not get caught. Just be creative with non-infringing tags and social media to get the word out.
Etsy,36iejf,sirius_moonlight,3,Tue May 19 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"That's a very good idea. I'm sure I could still use the color combos and use more vaguely connected tags, like ""magic,"" ""wizard,"" etc.--basically any related terms that are too widely used to be trademarked. I definitely don't WANT to infringe on anyone's copyright! I just know a lot of HP fans with dogs who would love something like that, and there isn't much (or any) officially licensed HP pet merchandise that I am aware of. I spent forever trying to find Slytherin bandanas for my dogs before I ended up deciding to make my own (which eventually led to this shop idea--I already have another shop on Etsy) and buying fabric from Spoonflower to do so.  I just wish I knew for sure if the doggie-themed house names were OK or not. It's iffy, definitely.  Thanks for the advice! :)"
Etsy,36iejf,etourneau,3,Tue May 19 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"Etsy is under scrutiny right now for all the copyright infringements and counterfeits.

So people that did get away with it may be under fire, too.  Just be very careful.

I operate multiple ecommerce stores (sell on Etsy as another revenue stream) and found myself being sued. It does not matter how small your shop is, or how much money you make. The claims are very, very serious.   We purchased a product line from a very large and reputable distributor. This product line did not generate much revenue. I think over the course of a year or two we sold $1500 in revenue. A patent holder felt that this product line infringed on their patent and began legal proceedings. No warning, no cease and desist, nothing other than a 100 page summons. They not only sued the manufacturer (our distributor) who created the allegedly infringing merchandise, but all of the downline retailers they could find.  Fortunately for us, the manufacturer provided the legal coverage for all of the retailers selling the product. I would hate to imagine the legal bills and stress if they did not or if we had designed the product for ourselves. I have been told by experienced legal professionals that defending an IP claim conservatively costs tens of thousands of dollars."

You should contact a lawyer honestly.."
Etsy,36iejf,kazuri85,3,Wed May 20 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"The thing with colors is that you need a certain formula to get a certain color. So, ""Tiffany Blue"" is a particular color made by Pantone. If you ask for anything made in that color, you won't get it.  Now, yellow and green are protected color combinations, but only if you use it to advertise or on something that resembles something that John Deere makes. You could make jewelry boxes with green boxes and yellow ribbons, and as long as you don't call it 'John Deere Jewelry' 'Farm Jewelry', Tractor Jewelry', etc, you will be ok.   You could paint a tractor a similar blue to Tiffany Blue. But you can't call it a Tiffany Tractor. Now, if you painted it purple, and called it a Tiffany tractor, you might be ok.   The thing you have to remember is that these laws are to prevent confusion. So, if you do something that could possibly cause confusion with a trademark, copyright, trade dress, color scheme, etc., you are going to have a bad time.

Usually what I've seen for digital files is you would sell her an extended license that would allow her to redistribute, resell, etc. It would be similar to a contract that you both sign, but at a pretty hefty upfront cost. Might be a good idea to research how other places price their extended license. An example is iStock Getty Images. A standard license for a stock photo is 1 credit which is equivalent to $13 or so. The extended license is AT LEAST 18 credits, equivalent to $234."

Also, one of my favorite shops since I started my relationship with Etsy was a shop selling Bird paintings.

Etsy,36gdpw,tramplamps,2,Tue May 19 14:07:24 2015 UTC,Art is very subjective so you really have to find people who fall in love with the pieces. I've been trying to sell my art on Etsy for 2 years and it is hard work. I sell high quality fine art prints too which are more expensive. A lot of people in America can sell cheap prints so its hard to compare when I am in Australia and people don't know the difference between what kind of paper the artist is using. Maybe some people don't care.. I am not sure. I just hope I can convey how special my prints are in my descriptions.

Etsy,36gdpw,Bitterrootmoon,1 point,Mon May 25 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hey there, Bitterrootmoon!   I went to a decently well-respected art school for undergrad and did many courses in art history as part of my BFA program, so I'm speaking from a solid academic foundation in art terminology.  Abstract art can be many things, but it cannot be representational/figurative.    In practical terms, though, if enough people truly believe that Abstract art must include figurative/representational forms, and search for such art using a modern search engine like Etsy or Google, then the ""SEO definition"" of the word may change over time.  If an artist notices that his/her figurative works are ranking high in google analytics for searches using the term ""abstract,"" it's  worthwhile to keyword for it.  Just to get the search engine traffic--not because it's an accurate description.  I'll leave the question as to whether non-subjective/abstract art has ""no point"" to philosophers and scholars of aesthetics.  I'm a geek, not a semiotician.    http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/representation.htm https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10946 http://www.artsicle.com/blog/understanding-abstract-art"
Etsy,36gdpw,skunkhaus,1 point,Mon May 25 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"In the very first few sentences of the Moma article you sent it says that abstract is representational. Representational does not mean realism, it simply means representing an idea or subject that exists. This can be found in works by Georgia O'Keeffe, de Kooning, and Paul Klee. Among my degrees I also have an art degree from a well respected art program, and have the opportunities to rub elbows with the likes of Darryl Pottorf and Marcus Jansen. As long as it is not a concrete, realistic image, abstract is representational of some idea or subject matter. Depending on how far the artist took the abstraction, one may not be able to recognize the idea or subject matter without an artist statement. So from a solid at terminology standpoint, yes, it could be considered abstract along with other categories."

Our natural, handmade, organic soaps are made with USDA certified organic ingredients. No chemical fillers, no toxic junk. Just pure, natural soap. Try it, compare it to commercially produced consumer products, and you will feel the difference. Your skin will thank you.  Be good to yourself. You deserve it.  Each of our soaps come in a recycled kraft paper wrapper. On the inside of each, you will find a little story, written by me, Robert. I hope you find some pleasure in these little slices of life. The stories in each ""flavor"" of soap differ, and over time, I'll continue to add new tales...  This business is owned and operated by a partially-disabled U.S. Military Veteran, and all products are Made in the U.S.A."

Etsy,36dma7,RogueVenus,6,Mon May 18 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"Let them know that you can only make original designs. Any characters owned by another company would be copyright infringement and could get your shop shut down. I think the way you described it was fine, but many people aren't aware of copyright laws so they might not understand completely."
Etsy,36dma7,littlesketchy,3,Mon May 18 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"Part of the ""problem"" is that so many of these artists, on Etsy, DeviantArt, and at conventions, openly make and sell infringing work without any open reprisals from the companies involved.  So, the customers expect it, and in some cases can not find legitimate outlets for their desires. (You try finding a Frozen cake that is authorized by Disney. )  So, you tell them,  ""I want to make original work only"", and they hear, ""I don't want to make Frozen."""
Etsy,36dma7,kinyutaka,6,Mon May 18 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Because conventions are a grey area. Even in japan, fanworks are encouraged, because it causes fans to buy more of the source material. I can't name the times I've bought something official because of fanart of MLP or some anime.  Im a pretty strong convention goer myself, and it always rubs me the wrong way when people absolutely condemn such stuff. Because you know you're not going to get that plush or hat officially, and you can't always make it yourself... So where do you go?"
Etsy,36dma7,MattsyKun,6,Mon May 18 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"This is where I think the big corps are missing a major trick.  Say I want (for example) some bad ass Thor or Loki armour. Because reasons. Now no way do I have the resources or technology to make it myself. And if go to the Disney store, will I find it? Will I hell. If I'm lucky I might be able to score a plastic helmet or a cloak made in China. This is not entirely Disneys fault. It is not feasible for them to make bad ass armour for mass distribution; it's just not worth their while.  However, it IS feasible and very much worth the time of a cosplay armourer. They have the maneuverability that Disney lacks, and are able to produce individual pieces without being restricted by large and potentially unprofitable factory orders.  It baffles me why big corps do not make it easier for small businesses to work with them. A cursory glance at Disneys licensing page, for instance, will tell you that basically theyre only interested in working with factories.   By introducing smaller licences (which don't cost tens of thousands of dollars), with pre-approved products and taking a cut of sales of said products, everybody would win. The consumer gets their bad ass armour, the small artist gets the work and the big corp still gets their money and retains their rights.  Of course, it would be too much effort for the big corps and would never happen. There is so much that would need ironing out beforehand. And ultimately they do own X/Y/Z so of course they may do what they like. I just think they're missing a trick..."
Etsy,36dma7,PiranhaPony,2,Mon May 18 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"This EXACTLY.   But you're right. It's too bothersome for them to figure out, so it's easier to just sue the crap out of someone.  :P  Heck, if that happened, I'd gladly purchase an official license from a few people. In theory, it could be a game changing idea. I mean, it kind of already happens in some places."
Etsy,36dma7,MattsyKun,1 point,Tue May 19 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"Well I do think it would take an awful lot of legal wrangling to arrange (for example; if BigCorp licenses smallbiz and consumer hurts themselves on something smallbiz makes, there would have to be some clause that makes it abundantly clear that smallbiz is culpable, although BigCorp would need to be bound by certain standards to which they hold their licence holders), so I can understand that it's not necessarily an overly attractive prospect. However I think it has the potential to be rewarding for them in the long term.  I mean consider the situation as it stands:  If smallbiz acts legally, and refuses to make (in this case) something Frozen-themed that the consumer can't find ""officially"", then consumer doesn't get their item, smallbiz doesn't get the business, and BigCorp doesn't get anything either - everyone loses.  If smallbiz acts illicitly and DOES make said Frozen-themed items, then consumer gets their item, smallbiz gets money and work (at a risk) and BigCorp still gets nothing - not everyone wins.   Thing is, if I approached Disney about some bad ass Marvel armour, or OPs customer approached them about this Frozen-themed product, then likely we wouldn't get very far. Although Disney might be able to make some profit off supplying us as individuals, by the time they've finished it's not really worth their while, and they have metric fucktons of other profit so the gain is worth less than the hassle if you see what I mean.  However, if BigCorps harnessed the power of small businesses then they could build an excellent capture-all model, whereby they are able to meet the demand for mass-produced products on their own ""official"" range, and license others to make art / armour / whatever it might be on their behalf when it is not possible for them to do so, and thereby meet the demand for more effort-intensive and unique merchandise.   But what do I know ;)"
Etsy,36dma7,PiranhaPony,2,Tue May 19 09:19:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Disney is obsessed with keeping tight reins on their image. It's the same reason they won't let adults dress up in the parks, in case guests erroneously believe those people are employees. There was recently? a case they made a 15 year old cover up or leave because she came in wearing IMO a completely nonauthentic looking costume. At the same time, I see their point because someone once drew the Disney princesses bruised and beaten and mimicked the style. I think it was protected from infringement because it was considered a parody. But imagine if someone took that art and put it on a T-shirt and sold it. How many people would believe it was official Disney? That would really tarnish their image. I think some of the differences between fanart between Japan and America also include quality of product and general cultural acceptance. Doujinshi artists typically don't emulate the original style of the artist, for instance, so it's clearly fanmade."
Etsy,36dma7,first_quadrant,1 point,Tue May 19 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"I completely agree - this is why the licenses I would propose have to be for pre-approved products and vendors only. Otherwise it would be open season and you'd get god knows what. The products would have to be in-line with the company's image and not directly compete with their own established products (i.e. no copy-paste printed tshirts using images from the films - there are already plenty of official ones of those).   I get why they're so protective of their image, I really do! I just think that if big companies like Disney started to link up more with smaller fan artists then you could really have something pretty great going on. The huge, HUGE amount of vendors who sell infringing material well should tell them something about the power they could harness if only they thought outside the box a little. The demand is there and it is massive. I can honestly say I've always been a bit underwhelmed by the official, licensed offerings of a lot of companies. When you look at some of the fan made stuff though, it's incredible! A very good example I've noticed recently is My Little Pony plushes. The official ones look awful. Some of the fan made ones knock them into a cocked hat. And of course, the fan vendors are able to make OCs and background characters that Hasbro will never touch on.  Like I say, complete pipe dream. I can only imagine the legal paperwork. Ah well..."

Etsy,36dma7,wordfactorydesign,3,Wed May 20 06:42:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to condemn fanart. I've made fanart, too. (Some of it even good enough to offer for sale.)  It's why I qualified ""problem"" in my last post. You can easily get licensed Power Ranger Morphing Devices, or Frozen T-Shirts, or Sailor Moon Playing Cards, but you simply can't buy a 36"" tall bead on canvas portrait of GokaiRed without it being fanart. And that's why companies like Toei don't use the banhammer too lightly.  But, I don't think I'd be able to make a similar sized piece with an original pattern and have any sort of interest in it.  OP is in that boat... they make original art, and don't wish to use copyrighted material, but that's what people are looking for."

Etsy,36elf4,doorpatch,2,Mon May 18 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"I live in NYC, so there are a lot of potential buyers practically on top of me. Unfortunately, the rules for selling in the street are very, very strict, and the prices for tables at craft fairs and flea markets are massively inflated (thanks NYC). I wouldn't want to participate in anything that required listing individual items again, its the most tedious, annoying part of Etsy. Linking people to your Etsy site to use as a gallery to make local, cash sales is against the ToS anyway.   I like the idea of handmade and collectible items only. Between Craigslist, eBay and thrift shops, buying one-off ""everything else"" items locally is pretty well covered. As is, this site looks like pretty Craigslist, which seems redundant. Have you considered listing primarily local sellers instead of local items?   I can fit my entire inventory in a small box so my shop is potentially very mobile. This is how I could imagine something like this working for me. So...a buyer types in their zip and selects a radius that they consider local, then names and thumbnails of shops come up. The shops could specify a list of times and places they are available to meet the buyer in person. Kind of like a dating profile. Here's how I was imagining it: ""Shop: The Glitoris: Handmade, Casual Jewelry!  -  Category: Jewelry/Accessories   -  Items: 120 items available    -   Availability: Mon-Thurs: Upper Manhattan after 5:30PM only. Sat-Sun: Manhattan, Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn, between 12 and 6 PM   -    Private homes: Y/N   -   Payment: Cash, credit, debit, paypal. NO checks, NO barter.   -   Click here to contact this seller."" Would there be a fee for sellers? How would that work? Monthly listing fee?"
Etsy,36elf4,poxteeth,1 point,Tue May 19 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood my comment re: linking to your etsy store. The site would be meant to allow buyers to discover local sellers, but that doesn't mean the seller would have to sell in-person. It's more a means of showcasing the fact that you're a real person making things out of Brooklyn (or wherever you are) but if you prefer to ship, you link to your etsy account to complete the sale. There's nothing against the ToS to link to your etsy page to make sales. Think of it like a blog where you directed buyers to etsy.  To your point about individual listings, I'm totally open to having it more like a ""shop directory"" but you'd still need some images or products to showcase your work for a buyer to be interested in your shop.  It'd be free to list and sell locally, but probably ad-supported to cover hosting costs. At this point, it's sorta moot since interest from sellers seems limited."
Etsy,36elf4,poxteeth,1 point,Tue May 19 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. My misunderstanding. I just figured the ""shop local"" option on Etsy already covers that niche. I think it violates ToS if you post a link on Etsy urging buyers to buy the same product either in person, or from another website, to avoid Etsy's fees. I suppose they have to be okay with it the other way around if the buyer did not find the item via Etsy.   Yeah, I think a simple thumbnail gallery would be better than duplicating individual listings. Maybe click a thumbnail, it takes you to a page that shows you an image gallery (like one automatically generated from a Pinterest board) and two buttons. One to ""contact this local seller for appointment"" or ""buy online"" and link the second to Etsy.   That's unfortunate. I think that there's room for this alongside sites like Etsy and Craigslist, especially in dense, urban areas. Seller's costs for displaying items locally is much higher in cities. I've had a couple of local buyers contact me on Etsy asking to meet in person so they could buy last-minute gifts. I have also mailed items to addresses less than 1 mile away, that just seems like a waste. A site like this could also serve as a vendor directory for people organizing small, local craft/holiday/street fairs and festivals."
Etsy,36elf4,Christypaints,1 point,Tue May 19 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""shop local"" seems to focus on local fairs and physical stores that showcase etsy sellers. I was thinking a website could highlight individual sellers in any given neighborhood. It'd be like having a local neighborhood fairs.  I've had similar local selling experiences as you, except in the bay area. Orders within the city and/or people nearby and asking to pick up. Guess it's not a big enough use case.  Anyway, thanks for your feedback. Much appreciated!"
Etsy,36elf4,Christypaints,1 point,Tue May 19 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"This seems like a cool idea, but I wouldn't necessarily want people to know my address before there is a sales situation. Not for any reason other than paranoia."

Etsy,367umo,m0untaingoat,1 point,Sun May 17 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, I should take pictures of the blemishes. Although with the mannequin, I don't think that would properly represent the majority of people's actual body figures.  I tried to make it as organic as possible in comparison to shopping in a store; you find your item hung on a hanger. I think that eliminates the stigma of thinking one has to have a certain body type in order to achieve the same look as the ideally perfect model-bodied mannequin in the picture; or would even possibly save me from a bad review saying that when they tried it on, it doesn't look like the mannequin picture.

Etsy,36638d,baldylox,2,Sat May 16 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"I use Etsy's Search Ads service. Usually, I keep it at the $7 per week level, and double it up in October-December for peak holiday shopping.   It works for me. It's impossible to tell exact numbers from the stats, but it seems like for every $1 I spend on Search Ads, I bring in $20-$30 or so.   In addition to your items being placed higher in Etsy searches, they also place higher in Google Shopping results, which can be huge. Then, there's targeted ads on other social media like Facebook, etc.   We have a huge variety of things in our shop, it's not just one thing like a lot of shops. I think that the huge variety helps quite a bit with SEO as well.   My wife makes all kinds of wool products from the fleece of our sheep. I do woodworking, jewelry, I restore vintage and antique musical instruments, vintage watches, clocks, antique cast iron, all kinds of other antiques and other neat things that I make. It's quite a variety of items. We usually have at least 300 different listings at all times.   So, yeah, it works for me."

I'm thinking about a friend of mine who also loves parties and she could talk a long time about party planning and she is very helpful. We all go to her for suggestions. If this is your niche you should expand on it in the About Page. Make it all about why you are the go-to party person.  You might want to skip or downplay the stay at home mom part. I only say this b/c you want to be seen as a professional seller of party things, not a mommy trying to make money on the side. That is my opinion, and I'm not an expert. :)  I have a question, and I'm not being snarky or anything just curious. Is there really a market for paper straws? I see a lot of shops like this, but I grew up hating paper straws (child in the 70's). I just can't imagine buying them. Just curious.  Your shop looks very nice and you have a great selection."

Pinterest is a good resource, and even a simple Google search can net decent results.  I started a board on Pinterest specifically to keep up with all the blogs & articles I've found that have helped me as a seller, or offered good ideas/inspiration for my shop as far as set up, marketing, about pages, shop policies, social media, etc.   And, of course, asking questions here on /r/etsy is usually a good way to go, too."
Etsy,366bp2,briekachu,2,Sat May 16 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Is it okay to sell Lego products on Etsy? (I genuinely don't know).
Etsy,366bp2,skunkhaus,5,Sat May 16 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"Lego is complicated because it's both a product, a brand, and a building supply.  Reading through forums, it seems like it is ok to sell certain Lego items on Etsy, if you're very careful with their trademark.  For instance, don't sell something lego-like and call it legos.  Use the registered trademark.  Don't claim that any lego creation you make is endorsed by Lego corporation.    Examples:     1980's era box of Lego bricks--ok to sell as vintage item. Present-day altered lego bricks (custom repaint)--ok to sell as handmade item, provided that Lego receives careful attribution as the supply manufacturer--but not the endorser--of the product Present-day jewelry made from lego bricks -- apparently ok to sell with careful attribution, though one seller reported contacting Lego to receive the appropriate wording for the item description, and for some reason received a cease-and-desist the following year. Present-day item created from off-brand stacking blocks, tagged as ""Lego""--not ok Present-day/handmade reproductions/fan art of IP material from Lego Movie -- OK for personal use, not ok for commercial sale. Non-lego objects hand-built to resemble stacking bricks (e.g. a large footstool with the approx shape and form of a stacking brick)-- OK to sell, not ok to use Lego registered trademark."

Etsy,362ch3,sevenfacedsin,1 point,Wed May 20 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"Some companies I feel are a little more lax on this. For example, Nintendo. I also make cross stitch patterns when I am not knitting or crocheting. I state that it is fanart, and that (for example) Legend of Zelda is property of Nintendo. I have been left alone. All of this wording is in the listing, the pattern and all links back to where the image originated are embedded in the patterns.   I can imagine huge movie companies like Disney and Warner Bros to go after people more aggressively.  I feel as though if you are making something that company also sells of their main product, such as posters of movies, they would clamp down real quick.  On the flipside of things, I also sell photography that one can download and use for their own personal use. Be it sourcing their own print, editing to their liking etc. I don't want someone reselling that image they downloaded from me, but of they wanted to use my images to make prints for their own gain, I a, fine, as long as they contact me."

Etsy,363gm4,theballinist,2,Fri May 15 19:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think your prices are fine, but you're probably not being found due to the lack of tag/title phrase matchings. if you're using popular phrases, you need both to match exactly to rank in the first few pages.  It might help to embellish your shop and your descriptions to help the customer feel some sort of connection to your work. What were you feeling when you designed x art, etc. Your shop seems rather empty at the moment with short policies and short descriptions."
Etsy,363gm4,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Fri May 15 21:04:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense, I'll see if expanding my titles and matching them to my tags helps, I've noticed that a lot of art sellers have extremely long titles. As for the descriptions I tend to be in school of thought that the art should speak for itself, however since this is an etsy shop and not an art gallery I will definitely take that into consideration. Thanks for your input!"
Etsy,363gm4,OyoPOP,2,Fri May 15 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"I think your prices are just fine.  The first problem you need to deal with is that you are titling your listings by the medium not the topic.  A better title for ""Giclee Fine Art Print - The Wild West - 8.5x11"""" might be ""Wild West Art Cactus in a Hat with Lasso Giclee Fine Art Print"".  There are almost 40,000 search results when I search for ""Giclee Fine Art Print"" but if I search for ""Wild West Art"" there are 2400 search results.  You will be lost in the first search, you have a fighting chance with the second one.  What you are currently doing would be like if I were to title my items as ""Yarn Acrylic Crochet Dress Size 5"" versus ""Blue Princess Dress, Birthday Dress, Crochet Tulle Tutu"".  Folks will be looking to satisfy a need for a Princess Birthday Dress - they probably don't initially care what is it made of.  Another way to think about this is to remember that art speaks to the heart and most people don't care about medium when a piece of art has touched them!  :D  Once you re-title your listings, then research prices.  A great Etsy market research tool for this is Marmalead.com.   It is especially good for pricing.  Read my blog, Searching for Etsy Relevancy to get some SEO guidance.  Good luck!"
Etsy,363gm4,ashmaster,1 point,Sat May 16 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"Lowering your prices would be a good idea. Simmilar sized prints go from about 20-35 dollars. The website tools4etsy.com will help you with your tags (when it works... its been down for 3 days)  You want to expand on your descriptions, remember when you are selling your art the buyer should feel like they are buying a piece on you, they want to know how you felt when you were designing it, the medium used ETC.   Your shop announcement is rather short. A shop announcement is a good way to get keywords in so use it to the best of your ability.   Your shop seems to be very stylized, in a dias de le meurtos theme, as well as a dark/macabre theme. you should use this to your advantage in tags."

Not lots of people are searching for LED or active electronic jewelry right now so you'll need to match it to the right keywords. If you target the rave/kandi crowd which loves to buy EL light stuff and blinking bras you could make a decent amount right off with it probably.   I'm at Maker Faire right now and there's always a few people with blinking jewelery stuff, even if it's only Adafruit, so I'll see if anything new is here."

Etsy,361o9z,PoppycockGifts,1 point,Fri May 15 16:41:51 2015 UTC,I'd wear them. except if they were like earrings that screamed lmao.
Etsy,361o9z,ashmaster,1 point,Fri May 15 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"It would depend heavily on the design (and price, obviously) as to whether I'd want jewelry like this. Anything blinking or with words, probably not. Something that really looks like a jewelry piece (not just a circuit strung on chain), that has strong graphic lines, maybe glowed or slowly rotated through colors, or that showed the pieces actually doing their thing - that's maybe. I usually prefer a small (~1cm or smaller) stud earring to something large.  Also: if it lights up, it's gotta turn OFF and not just by taking the battery out."

However I'd be wary to actually wear something like that, especially for circuit boards since I know a lot of them contain heavy metal and other substances that you wouldn't want leaching into your skin over time.   Here's an article: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/data-center/what-it-pros-should-know-about-exposure-to-hazardous-materials/  My dad is a hardware engineer and has a workshop. He's very careful when he's working on stuff like circuit boards and the such. I would not be comfortable with that kind of stuff with direct contact with my skin unless the seller assured me somehow that it is safe."

As a side note, I work with lead for a living so I understand the safety concerns working with hazardous materials, especially since they're present in circuit boards."

Etsy,361o9z,swxw,1 point,Wed May 20 00:36:39 2015 UTC,I actually don't- it never occurred to me to mention that. I guess I assumed it would be evident through photos. Looks like I'll be doing some editing :)

Thanks again for your time/help!"
Etsy,3638o5,ashmaster,1 point,Fri May 15 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"When you price your items too cheap people think the quality is low. She has to think also, what would she rather do sell one dress for $50.00 or 10 for 10 dollars each?  She can do like price ranges, easier designs could sell for less where as more exquisite ones would be higher in price.   Now let me do a little look at her shop.  First thing I notice is that the pictures are on the hangers, does she know a little girl who could model? Kids don't ask for much lol give her some chocolate bars or something for her help. When people see something on a live model they are more likely to buy then if its just on a hanger; this way they know how the material will hang.  Another thing is that she should have atleast 2 pages of things, even if that means having a simplex section where she makes something like hairbands that would look nice with the dresses; this will move her up in the search rank. She simply doesn't have enough stuff in such a saturated market.   https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/187005264/lace-rustic-flower-girl-dress-champagne?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=handmade&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=girls%20dress&ref=sr_gallery_6  this is a good example of what she should be charging as well as the photos I was talking about, I also like this design personally, people are into the boho look right now even for their kids and I don't think its going anywhere anytime soon.   Also notice the title, your mother should be making her title look simmilar and the tags are to match the title.   Hope that helps."
Etsy,3638o5,ashmaster,1 point,Fri May 15 19:28:06 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this.  You really made a breakthrough with her on pricing.  She loves the idea of having simple dresses for a lower price and premium dresses at a higher one.  Also the photo advice and the listing you gave for reference will help a ton.
Etsy,3638o5,jbbnorth,1 point,Fri May 15 19:52:23 2015 UTC,no problem :) I'm confident that this will help her product line immensely.
Etsy,3638o5,trailscrafts,1 point,Fri May 15 21:29:50 2015 UTC,"keep researching about Etsy SEO and tags. You want tags to be phrases people will search ""girls summer dress"" ""girls red dress"" ""red flower dress"" ""ladybug dress"" stuff like that.  Descriptions should be more detailed. What material is the dress made of, what are all the measurements, not just the chest.  I'm not sure, but I think the Disney Princess dress is illegal. I can't remember for sure, but I am pretty sure you can only use licensed fabric for personal use.  More listings will help you get found better. You might also want to consider offering more sizes? You are limiting your customer base by only offering one size. You could just add something in the description, ""if you don't see your size listed, let me know and if I have the fabric I'll make whatever size you need."" Or something more eloquent than that.  Best of luck."

I don't know if I got any returned business later on with my cards. I nearly sold out my first day. I wouldn't recommend doing a two day show right our of the gate.   Tips and experiences    I had to buy a tent, some table clothes, and some displays. I did get a card square reader. fees associated Collect tax or price items with tax included to take out later a special event license or tax license is recommend (Colorado) My table fee at the first show was 70$ for two days, with a 10x10 spot I'm doing a show this Saturday $40 for 7 hours at 2x4 table. Read your contract thoroughly. 90% of shows will have them. Pinterest, youtube and reddit. Are amazing at tips and display ideas for any craft. I watch a lot of videos of people setting up and walking shows.  Always ask what resources are available. WIFI available? Cell tower dead zone? extra charge for electricity?  Will I be able to make change with someone if I become over whelmed with large bills? (best problem to have) If you can find a show buddy, or drag someone along. Bathroom breaks and stretches are a must. Just don't leave your table unattended.    Do your research, there's bound to be a show some time that fits your schedule. Look for Facebook groups in your area.  I find more through facebook than I do through paid sites that list shows. Usually the shows listed in the sites are out of my budget.  I made of a lot of my stands and displays. I have a small car so doing a 10x10 spot is a tetris event to rival the best.   Good luck !"
Etsy,360ejx,PagePenguin,1 point,Fri May 15 01:56:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! This is all great to know! I'm a little concerned about the costs of setup supplies, but I guess if you do enough events it's worth it. My other issue is that right now, nearly all my items are made to order (saves me on money/supplies), and I have two different size variations for each item...So sewing a bunch of them to sell upfront is a little scary to think about, since if they don't sell I may have trouble selling the premade ones since the sizes will be set.

Now I sell at fairs (and do some wholesale) as a full time job.  u/PagePenguin gave some spot on advice. Starting to do shows is definitely something that can be expensive at first and the booth fees can really add up.   Some advice:   Talk to people who have participated in the event before. How were the crowds? What other types of vendors were there? Stay away from shows that also allow non handmade vendors (think Scentsy, 31 purses, Tupperware, etc). I've never had good luck at shows like that.  Defnitely accept credit cards. We use Square and love it. Probably 75% of transactions at some of the shows we do are credit cards.  Solid color bedsheets make excellent table covers in a pinch. You can also get nice fabric ones at places like Sam's Club and online. Greet your customers, offer assistance and don't be afraid to talk up your items and process of creating them... what makes them special?

I'm unfortunately in an area where I'd likely have to travel a little for any decent size events; and again it's hard to even find something that works around my work schedule. But I think it would be fun to do! Is there a particular reason you use Square instead of selling in person via Etsy? (They have a card reader too don't they?) Is it just because Etsy fees are too high? I know someone who uses a PayPal card and reader, do you know of any pros/cons of that vs Square? :)"

Etsy,36062n,LoveTheBlueSky,3,Fri May 15 00:11:50 2015 UTC,"OK this is a big long advice lol:)  I was like this last year about this time (weddings)...this year I have taken a big drop in sales but the last 2 years I have hovered at about 100 open orders at a time for like 6-8 months at a time.  What I do is I schedule orders based on the date they need them. This allows me to ""book"" my production and I can manage my schedule much better- I started doing this the first year I was open and it's been aces. I have a big wall calendar and I write the clients name on their delivery date. I check this every morning to see how my week looks. I print every invoice out and this is how I track everything. I have a clipboard for: ""design"", ""out for approval"" and ""make"" and I move the invoice from one to the other as that project moves along. I make notes directly on the invoice and highlight anything unusual (like needing to order a special color or if it is an international order etc).  Not sure if you are operating the same way or if you are doing ""first come-first served""? If you are operating on first come-first served then my advice is to shut it down for 2 days....vacation mode or deactivate listings. This stops the convos (mostly) so you can concentrate on the tasks as hand without losing too much in sales.  Get yourself together, look at every order and plan your attack as far as if you need supplies for it etc. Look at your shipping supplies and get them a little more organized. Place orders or go shopping to get yourself stocked back up.  Then group your orders based on urgency and make piles and take the most urgent pile and tackle that first then move on along...  When you feel like you have a handle on it, open back up :)"

I do need to get organized a lot more - and i think printing out order forms might help....I work on need by dates and rush orders of course come first, but wow people have no concept of ""time""!~ In addition to my Etsy shop, I also do designs and sell most of my items on two other sites who subcontract my services - they are even busier than I am and they work on only FIVE day turn around! to my that's insane, I can't keep up - but they won't budge on the deadlines because they want to say competitive."
Etsy,36062n,clshaw,1 point,Fri May 15 01:55:08 2015 UTC,I know it sounds old school and wasteful but the paper invoice thing coupled with the clipboards and the calendar has been the best. I'd say to be more firm with timing on your Etsy shop as you know the other work has hard deadlines.  I tell people they have to order 21 business days in advance of the day they need it. I do flex this but just having it as a basic policy helps because people often convo me months early for preliminary info so this way they know not to wait until the last minute to buy their stuff :)

The label printing through Etsy doesn't allow you to select gift, so I don't know any other way  :)  Different countries have different duties, taxes, and customs clearance fees. Usually it's based on based on the price/type of item, weight and dimensions, origin country, things like that.    I don't think you need to try and figure out what the fees might be for an international buyer. You can if you like, but I feel like that would be a lot of anguish for you, and it might not be correct.

Etsy,35z82s,throwawayhermes,1 point,Thu May 14 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Take pictures of the typewriter and your packaging and have recorded conversations with him acknowledging the damage. Insure the package yourself when sending it back.   Just file the claim as he asks and let FedEx deal with the claim. If you took pictures of the insufficient packaging, I'm sure they'll take it into account. You can always write a poor review if you feel that strongly about the poor packaging, but I don't think it's worth hassling the seller over if you get your full refund."

I just wanted to figure out the best plan of action to make sure I'm refunded by the seller. Basically he is offering a refund if I ship it to him so long as there is no other damage upon arrival. And I want to make sure there is no chance of him recieving it, saying there is more damage, and thereby keeping his typewriter and not refunding me of my initial purchase. Thanks for the reply! I appreciate your help!"

Etsy,35z82s,mojoman913,1 point,Sat May 16 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"I restore and sell vintage and antique typewriters on Etsy, so I feel your pain.  First thing you want to do is take a lot of photos of the damage. Photo the packaging if you can, but especially the machine. Don't just photo the areas you think are damaged, photograph all parts. If there's a top plate or cover you can remove or flip up, make sure to photo the typebars and ribbon spools as well. Also, if the machine came with a case, photograph that.  Second, when you package a typewriter, it's all about preventing motion, or preventing the typewriter from damaging itself by moving while in the box. 1. Carriage First and foremost, you want to prevent the carriage and other moving parts from moving. You do this primarily by locking the carriage in place (if the machine is a portable and has a carriage lock) and by isolating the typebars. If the machine is a basket shift (where the typebars move down when you press the 'shift key) you'll want to depress the shift-lock to keep the basket down, then place cushioning material (small bubble bubble-wrap) between the typebars and the top cover. Alternatively, you can ship the machine without the shift lock down, and place bubble wrap under the shift keys to keep them from depressing, and more wrap in the type basket to keep the bars from moving.  Once you've padded the typebars and shift keys, wrap the return bar in bubble wrap, then wrap the carriage in place using plastic wrap. Wrap several layers around the carriage and the machine to keep the carriage from moving.    2. Case. If the machine is a portable, set the typewriter in its case and lock it in place if there is a locking mechanism. If there is space between the sides of the machine and the case, fill the spaces with small bubble bubble-wrap. Once filled, wrap the machine with plastic wrap again, this time wrapping the machine to the bottom of the case. (If there is no case, this step is not necessary.) Once wrapped, add small bubble bubble-wrap over the top of the machine and close the case.    3. Boxing. Wrap the case in three rings of large bubble bubble-wrap: one encircling the case front to back, one encircling the case side-to-side, and one encircling the case around the edges. Tape the final layer down at the corners. Place the wrapped typewriter package in a box that is as close to the size of the package as possible. If there is any space between the package and the box, fill that space with wadded bubble wrap or packing peanuts, but ideally the package should be tight on all sides. (Again, the idea is to prevent the typewriter from moving while in the box.)    4. Double-Boxing If the machine is a standard, or doesn't have a case, you'll want to double-box. Wrap the original box in three rings of large bubble wrap just like you did to the case in step 3, then fit that wrapped package into a second box. Seal with strong packing tape and ship.  You can also double-box a portable, but this isn't always necessary.  Third, I'm pretty sure it's up to the seller to file the claim, not you, but I could be wrong. Send the photos to the seller when you return the machine, and have him/her go through the FedEx claim process. The seller should refund your purchase as soon as you ship the item back.  Finally, if you buy a typewriter again, make sure the seller knows what he/she is doing. I've shipped about 80 typewriters and have not had any damaged packages, and I only ship FedEx. Conversely, I've received about a dozen in the mail, and three of those were damaged because of improper shipping. One of those was shipped from Goodwill and was in multiple pieces when I received it.  Good luck.  EDIT: And I just noticed your username. Please tell me that the damaged machine wasn't a Hermes. That would be truly awful."

Etsy,35xs97,messhams,6,Thu May 14 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"Here's the reality of it: Etsy is a selling platform. They are giving you a storefront, and that's pretty much all they're giving you. You open a store, Etsy hosts it, and pretty much everything else is up to you.  GENERIC ADVICE ALERT  You are to:   Create a quality product Find a way to display it (photographs) Find a way to describe it (item description, titles) Drive people to your shop (SEO, possibly ads, social media) Provide quality customer service (answering inquiries, shipping orders quickly and correctly, handing after sale issues.   In doing all of these things, you've got to stand out from the competition and make yourself seem unique, but still approachable and relatable.  Etsy isn't for wimps! I've got 184 sales in a little more than a year and a half, and I just opened a second shop - I am working ALL THE TIME. You've really gotta love your shop and your product."
Etsy,35xs97,RogueVenus,4,Thu May 14 13:00:18 2015 UTC,You're right about everything. The amount of people I see on the etsy forum complaining about views and sales when they have never once promoted anything at all and just expect people to know they're there is so high. It's like opening a bricks and mortar store down a back ally and never telling anyone then being surprised you don't get anyone in.

Etsy,35xs97,dearwilde,1 point,Thu May 14 12:28:44 2015 UTC,"I know that this is every seller's least favorite advice to hear, but I think it's some of the most important: go through your shop/descriptions and check for grammar, spelling, capitalization, etc. It's such an easy fix, but it can make or break your ""professionalism"" in the eyes of potential buyers. Also, I would recommend revisiting your descriptions and tags, and try to consider them from a buyer's point of view: how will they find your items in a search, what descriptive language might entice them into buying from your shop?   I would add a few more items to your shop, as well. Having a diverse stock can lead to more views, more favorites, and more choices for customers to consider purchasing.   I second what other commenters have mentioned about your photos; having different angles and natural lighting can make shop photos look  endlessly more appealing  (and this is still a lesson I'm trying to learn for my own shop!)  Good luck with your shop, and I hope you find more success in the future! :)"
Etsy,35xs97,JessicaAnnsEmporium,3,Thu May 14 12:56:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the spelling and grammar. (Ha, you wrote grammer.)

Etsy,35xs97,giantslor,0,Thu May 14 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"You're going to need a product that 18 to 25 year old girls absolutely can't live without. Etsy is going to do almost everything they can to kill your shop---excessive and increasing fees for views, non existent customer service for sellers, selectively enforced policies.  Etsy is the only platform I know of that takes a growing/potentially successful shop with an owner that's willing to do a lot of work and actively makes it harder for them to sell with policy changes every month or two.  I have started to move all of my vintage items to ebay and have easily quadrupled my sales with no marketing."
Etsy,35xs97,giantslor,3,Thu May 14 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's entirely fair to place the blame for low sales/views/etc on Etsy-- like other people have said, they give you the space to sell, but after that, the responsibilty for every other detail of a shop falls on the seller. Essentially, whether your shop is successful or not depends on whether you put the time, effort, and passion into making it successful.   I can't help but think that your comment comes across as awfully cynical."
Etsy,35xs97,fairyrebel,-1,Thu May 14 14:50:00 2015 UTC,I think they've completely rigged the search function against people who load their shop with hundreds of similar items... that's how people found my stuff until promoted listings essentially erased my profit margins.
Etsy,35xs97,giantslor,-1,Thu May 14 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"Also whenever anyone asks this question the immediate generic seo answer pops up... but you're only really optimizing for etsy ' s search function. If they will only display one listing from a shop per search page, you can no longer optimize your listings.  Of course someone will pop up here and say their hits from etsy search pale in comparison to what they bring in off site. Whatever.  I am proudly cynical about etsy after using it for several years. I hope they improve but to me it's clearly getting worse and worse."
Etsy,35xs97,fairyrebel,2,Thu May 14 15:18:35 2015 UTC,One listing per search page isn't true. Several of my similar items appear on the same page of a search. I check it frequently when trying to evaluate how my items appear and I can't remember that limitation ever being in place.

I feel like the phrase we are using isn't nearly as untouchable as Arnie's 'I'll be back'. It is a Friends tv show quote. It is generic enough without being Joey's 'How you doin??'.
Etsy,35yw1z,sneaky_dragon,6,Thu May 14 18:01:42 2015 UTC,"If you know for a fact that the quote didn't originate from the seller and you didn't copy their design, I would just ignore the messages.  This is assuming that you used your own arrangement and design and it's sufficiently different and not likely for people to think that it's an identical product to the other seller."
Etsy,35yw1z,Oncled,2,Thu May 14 20:29:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for your answers Sneaky - you are right. Friends franchise probably owns the saying. I feel like my design is sufficiently different to the other sellers. I'm using a font I have made/designed myself as I didn't want to use someone elses font and get in trouble for not having commercial licence to use their font. I'm also using completely different materials. I know it is a big case of he said/she said and I am only giving my side of the arguement. So I need to take that into consideration.
Etsy,35yw1z,laughingrrrl,3,Thu May 14 21:27:31 2015 UTC,Should I request the other seller sends me a copy of their trademark filing? And if they don't have one - then point them to the fact that I have not copied anything from them.

Etsy,35yw1z,lovelyalone,2,Tue May 19 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"If it's a quote from a third party and you give credit, the other seller is pitching a hissy fit b/c s/he just doesn't want competition, not for any valid legal reason.  There are very concrete legal guidelines for what constitutes plagarism, and if you credit a quote, you'll never go wrong.   The legal definition is something like nine words in a row that are identical to the source.   I forget the exact number, but with that knowledge you can either Google it or credit it and forget it."

Etsy,35yw1z,ashmaster,8,Thu May 14 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but I understand that it's not a full defense if you're using a short phrase, but it is a defense if someone tries to sue you for quoting from copyrighted material.

I mean, do you just personally invoice them with the combined price at the end?

Etsy,35x2rm,The_X-Wing_Ace,2,Thu May 14 06:00:07 2015 UTC,"Just as a warning, Etsy is saturated with crocheted/knitted goods, and you'll need to offer something special to stand out from the thousands of similar shops.  I'd think of something that you enjoy or an adjective that you feel embodies the spirit of your work and brainstorm off of there. If you keep it generic like XX Creations, it doesn't limit you to a specific genre."
Etsy,35x2rm,sneaky_dragon,2,Thu May 14 07:17:46 2015 UTC,"In MY opinion, I wouldn't use a screen name that you use anywhere else. If someone remembers your shop name, and puts it into Google, they're going to find all of your gaming and social media stuff.  When I opened my shop, I used a name that I had never used for anything else - And I Googled it to make sure no one else was using it. I built all of my shop social media around it. So now, when you Google my shop name, the whole first page of results (and most of the second page!) is related to my shop."

Etsy,35utar,atattooonmyvajayjay,2,Wed May 13 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"You might want to add tags such as plus size, etc. Because I'm wide and I just assumed these wouldn't fit me. I would search ""plus size underwear"". As far as tags are concerned, also think about the colors in each listing and/or patterns, teens / girls / ladies and even men. There are some fabulous men out there that might LOVE to wear some of these patterns.   Also, have you thought about having someone model these? Have them wear a t-shirt and these cute underwear! Try to find someone who wouldn't mind modeling for a few bucks / a free pair!  I know I mentioned men above, but have you thought about briefs for men? I can just imagine there are a ton of cool patterns or designs that dudes would love to wear.  These are great! Love your shop!"
Etsy,35utar,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Wed May 13 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"Plus Size is something I would have never thought of needing to search for separately! That is the BEST idea for a tag yet! You rock my socks!  I have thought about men's items, and I do offer them on my FB page, but haven't added them to my shop yet - it is most certainly on the list. That and bras are my next project - I'm tweaking some patterns and then they go up!  I'm actually working on a mannequin for the swimsuits, I'm refinishing one with fabric to help make it not look so creepy - I may use it for the underwear too. I tend to only sell 4-5 per fabric and move on to something else, just to keep it fresh."
Etsy,35utar,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Wed May 13 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help!   If you're ever stuck as to what you can do for tags, think of what you would search as a customer. You might also (if you didn't already) want to put some tags like gift, present, wedding, party, birthday, and the word unique. That way if someone searches for 'unique birthday gift' you're covered (HA, get it?)"
Etsy,35utar,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Wed May 13 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"Make the size chart a better quality image at 1000x1000. It's so blurry and there's tons of artifacts in the image you use right now.  Write something about the payment types you accept in your policies.  Other than working on the tags as you already know, it looks pretty good. Congrats on the sales."

Etsy,35q8ma,Answer_the_Call,3,Tue May 12 19:32:49 2015 UTC,Does that really matter? If she created it and someone ripped it off it doesn't matter if you think it was original. I mean they didn't really change it at all. They didn't even try and hide the rip off by putting it on a navy tshirt. Or adding color. They knew it was selling just like it is so they kept it that way.  She has a good case and will get a settlement if she hires a lawyer.

Etsy,35q8ma,sneaky_dragon,5,Wed May 13 14:12:50 2015 UTC,I always find it interesting when people claim they don't have the money to register a copyright for their art. It's only like $35 for the filing fee and you can copyright batches of artwork at once.

Etsy,35q8ma,sneaky_dragon,7,Tue May 12 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"You don't have to, but it makes it easier to prove the design is originally yours, and if you want to claim damages you'll need to register it.   http://copyright.gov/circs/circ40.pdf   However, the Copyright Office must have acted on your application before you can file a suit for copy right infringement, and certain remedies, such as statutory  damages and attorney’s fees, are available only for acts of  infringement that occurred after the effective date of registration.

Etsy,35pn53,DanTheManWithAPlan,5,Tue May 12 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"Your flasks are expensive, and though they may be worth  more than a regular flask, your description doesn't tell me why I should pay 65$ USD for yours versus $20 for a flask that to me looks very similar. If yours aren't made in China, add that! I am sure all the $15-$20 flasks are cheap china stuff and people look for stuff not made in China. If you're going to charge more than other people, you need to convince them why they should spend the extra money on your flasks.   I would put the cheapest flask first, seeing $250 right at your first listing would make me turn and run.  I would also change up your titles. In this listing: ""SWIG Harris Tweed Hip Flask | SALE 20 Pounds Off!"" you only have 1 phrase people might search for, ""hip flask."" I personally would do something more like  ""Groomsmen Gift | Monogrammed Flask | Metal Hip Flask | Groomsmen Flask | Engraved Flask | Heritage Quality Flask""  If they are made in England, I would maybe even try to fit ""Made in England"" in my title. You need something that sets you apart from everyone since your charging more than most. Unless people know your brand, I wouldn't waste the title space to put it there. Once you get established, you could add it back in.   You could also try listing sets for groomsmen gifts and give a little bulk discount. Sets of 4,6 and 8 maybe?  Best of luck."
Etsy,35pn53,jbbnorth,2,Tue May 12 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"this is really important. I read SWIG's product description and thought... well, whats so special about it? If you hand smelted that thing, i want to know about it. the type of person who buys a £150+ hip flask wants to brag ""yeah, it is made of solid XYZ by this boutique in ABC"". even pictures of the making process would be great."
Etsy,35pn53,starshinenight,1 point,Tue May 12 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"oh and maybe in your tags and description, you could use ""Anglophile gift"" and ""This would be a great gift for the Anglophile in your life."" Or something like that. Especially on the Union Jack one."
Etsy,35pn53,jbbnorth,2,Tue May 12 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"I remember you from a week ago. This might be hard to hear, but changes don't always come easy or quick. I've never paid for advertising. My personal opinion is to put that money into making more product. See if someone you know will purchase for half off and writing an honest review for you.  Also, I'm pretty sure someone in the last thread told you to get some more items in that shop! It looks bare. What are the sizes of everything? In the executive hip flask, I have no idea how big anything is. How much does it hold? etc.  Your policies state ""we've decided to give our customers a 100% lifestyle warranty. If there's ever any issue with your flask, simply post it back to us and we'll offer you a free refund""  So I thought, Wow! How generous. Then I read this in the next sentence: ""You do have to provide proof of purchase and the flask must be resellable."" - I wouldn't call it a ""lifestyle"" warranty if it's only for defects.   I see that you put a description of your business in your banner. It does help show what SWIG means. But in the descriptions you say in a multitude of ways that PROFESSIONALS BUY THESE. That only tells me that this is who you WANT to buy your items. Try speaking to professionals without saying so. Jay-Z doesn't say ""MY stuff is only for rich people!"" He lets his branding do it for him. Would it be terrible if you had a secondary market? What about best men or grooms? You don't have to directly make something just for them, but to single out everyone else in your description might be hindering you.   This is the part I don't want to say. But.. sigh I feel like I have to. SWIG to me sounds really pretentious... and kind of YO BRO LET'S GET OUR SWIG ON. Perhaps I'm not the target market. But I buy for a lot of men. Maybe there's a way of going around this? Maybe it's a part of your business strategy? I'm really not trying to be mean, I feel terrible typing this out. But I'd rather it come from me, than from your lack of sales, and no one just ever had the bollocks to tell you (See what I did there? A yankee can use slang!)  Let us know some of the things you have changed from last time you posted!  EDIT: Thought of more things. See if anyone in your area will sell them in a upscale store? Go to a kind of show or street market? Your items are beautiful, and appear to be well made. These things can take a lot of time and effort. Have you looked into other people who sell flasks on etsy? What are they doing right or wrong, and are you doing anything that you could improve upon simply compared to them?"
Etsy,35pn53,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Tue May 12 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree on the branding part. Have you never heard the phrase ""take a swig?"" As a guy, the thing that scares me most is the price. 250$ is insane for something I'll use only on occasion."
Etsy,35pn53,Vpicone,0,Tue May 12 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get it that not everyone is going to have the first impression I did. I hated to say it, but I would want to know if it were my shop."

SWIG as a company also sells elsewhere and we're doing really well on (swigflasks.com), I was hoping that if I opened a Etsy store it'd help us to create another revenue stream.  Really appreciate your feedback, I love the SWIG opinion part. I understand how the brand can come across as quite pretentious.  I shan't abuse the subreddit with NOTHS feedback requests until I've made some significant changes.  Much appreciated, Daniel"
Etsy,35pn53,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Tue May 12 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, well I am really happy to hear that you're doing well on your own website. Do you have any other products you can add? Styles? Descriptions from the website?  It can totally give you another revenue stream, but I think the majority of the customers on etsy are women. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it is heavily female verses male. That might alter how to market to your customers - or at least how to sell. What words to use. Adding the tags for wedding, etc.  I love helping, but I also love hearing the changes that have been implemented from the other times people ask for help. It makes me feel like I'm doing something meaningful with my time! haha.  Also what /u/jbbnorth said about your title. Titles are basically high level tags. Use them to get your items in search results!"
Etsy,35pn53,skunkhaus,3,Tue May 12 14:47:29 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go a bit grammar a**hole school marmy here, but I really dislike your wording as follows:  ""My goal with the SWIG® Gift Set is never to disappoint both the purchaser and the recipient.""  Taken literally, that sentence means that you'd be glad to disappoint either the purchaser or the recipient, just not both at the same time.    I'm sure that's not what you mean, and I'm pretty sure that's not the sole driver in lower sales, but at a price point like yours, it pays to be meticulous."

Like $5-$10!)   I went through this exact same thing except I have a fulltime corporate job and I'm averaging about 3/4 sales now down from 7-10 sales a day (I went on vacation mode for 3 months for personal reasons) I also raised my prices and sales sky rocketed so really raise them up to where you think people would second guess ordering from you (not really) If your item costs $30 raise it to $35 or $37! MAKE THAT MONEY!! :D  Best of Luck!  PS Whats your store :)  EDIT: Found your store so cute! Stop free shipping asap! No need for that! If you feel you really want that than raise it up to $75"

Etsy,35nxlm,nae42,6,Tue May 12 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation. I ended up setting my store on vacation and now months later am starting to pick it back up. I think I got entirely burnt out- my prices were too low for the amount of work that went into each item I was selling and while I was making a profit off of it, I wasn't enjoying it anymore.   You've taken the best first steps of raising your prices and reaching out to people about slight delays.  I don't know what you sell, but you may want to consider setting limits weekly- like doing 25 orders a week and only listing that many. Then, in your header, you can say new orders that are placed Sunday-Saturday and will be fulfilled the week after. Does that make sense? It would give you some buffer time and help plan out your time. If you wanted, you could offer rush processing to have a faster turnaround time, but you've got to put yourself first.   If you want to talk through planning or any other ideas for your store (and if any of this is helpful) feel free to message me :)"

Etsy,35nxlm,skunkhaus,2,Wed May 13 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"Raise your prices so that you are only getting in as many orders as you can reasonably manage. If you keep taking orders and then keep delaying them it will result in bad reviews which will lower your ability to make lots of sales in the future. Also, this is just good practice. Demand is too high so you need to accomodate it price wise. I doubt your productivity will go up much once you have a newborn so get it under control now. Double your prices right now on a few things and see what happens.   I just spent the entire month of April on vacation, including having to delay a bunch of orders before it due to an injury. I'm just now starting to get back to multiple orders per day. I'm back to ranking and back to selling so there was no long term harm.   The main goal of this situation though is to apologize once, and only once. People start to get annoyed and feel mislead if you delay on them once and then miss that timeline and delay again, so if putting your shop on vacation mode and not adding any new orders is what will lower your stress level and keep the distractions away to fulfill the orders you do have, then do it right now."

Etsy,35nwrq,ashmaster,1 point,Tue May 12 01:18:06 2015 UTC,Hi. Your descriptions are very short. Think of what other information a prospective buyer would want to know prior to buying. Most are too lazy to message you and will just move on. Think what questions would I have if I were buying this. Answer those in the description.   Tags and titles. Make sure you're using targeted tags. By that I mean tags that buyers will put in etsy search when looking to purchase what you're selling. Be specific enough that you can rank on the first couple pages. Single word tags are too broad to rank highly. Think two to three words (less than 22 characters though). Use https://marmalead.com to help with finding the best tags. Use your best search phrase as the start of your title.
Etsy,35nwrq,marmalead,0,Tue May 12 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds like I am trying to market you, but honestly I am not.  I created a tool to analyze shop listings for Shop Owner's just like you - especially, because you have so many listings.  The tool I developed works off of your shop data and assesses each listing for its SEO relevancy.  The produced report allows you to identify and then work on your poorest performing listings.  Read my blog, Searching for Etsy Relevancy to get some SEO guidance and if you would like a shop report card, check out my Etsy listing Etsy Shop Critique and Report Card.  Because I really believe in the usefulness of the information I am providing, I offer a money back guarantee if you do not find the information helpful.  Also, my shop offers Redditors a 15% discount with Reddit15.  Good luck!"
Etsy,35nwrq,OyoPOP,1 point,Tue May 12 04:01:07 2015 UTC,How did this help your own store?
Etsy,35nwrq,maria_ivanovna,1 point,Wed May 13 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"I apologize for not responding sooner - I didn't see this comment.  I have over 55 listings and am slowly working off the ones that scored poorly.  Every listing I have 'fixed' has consistently been getting hits.  My overall views have also increased.  Google only crawls Etsy Shops about once a month, so when I first started following the 'recipe' I did not see immediate results and was quite frustrated, but in time it ramped up quite a bit.  I am a part-time Etsian, so believe me it was quite scary! :D"
Etsy,35nwrq,OyoPOP,1 point,Thu May 14 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"Your art work is wonderful, I really like the paintings.  Are you getting the views you expect?  Your tags are very good.  From what I understand you can increase your Etsy Relevancy by using your tags in your descriptions, but make the prose reader friendly.  I think you are missing the boat on your titles (again from what I understand about SEO)  The first couple of words in the title are key for search relevance.  So rather than ""Small original painting of window made from oroiginal photograph and acrylic paint. Small canvas. Greek windows."" you might start the title with ""Greek Window Painting ..."".  Also, you had a typo of the word ""original"".  Hope you don't mind the impromptu review, it's just that I like your shop and I would like to see you reach more folks!  Good Luck!"
Etsy,35nwrq,OyoPOP,1 point,Thu May 14 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The reason I was asking  was that I understand how the SEO and etsy work, but I always feel like I am missing something. So I was wondering how your understanding of SEO and having an etsy store working out( since ppl who offer these services on etsy rarely have stores with actual products) . Again, thank you so much for your advice!"
Etsy,35nwrq,maria_ivanovna,1 point,Thu May 14 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"I read your blog article the other day, and I thought it was outstanding."

I have had a lot of views on the listing but no orders.  I find this disappointing because I really believe it will help folks.  I have offered a money back guarantee because I believe in it that much!  Have you looked at the listing?   If so, can you offer a critique?"
Etsy,35nwrq,OyoPOP,1 point,Thu May 14 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually looked at the listing, because I don't have an Etsy shop (I'm an apps developer). Lemme take a quick peek and get back to ya!"

Etsy,35n73r,boo_hiss,1 point,Mon May 11 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  I did figure this out on my own, but it sure took me awhile!  I mis-interpreted what I read, but then saw a graphic and it became clear!"
Etsy,35n73r,JessicaAnnsEmporium,2,Tue May 12 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"I was confused by this too. Maybe I figured it out?  On the etsy shipping calculator, it says you cannot ship it first class international. (From what I understand there are weight/size restrictions that they don't allow online.) Perhaps the number you are getting from the USPS is the first class international price you can purchase only directly through them online, or in person?"
Etsy,35n73r,JessicaAnnsEmporium,1 point,Mon May 11 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"When I try to purchase it, Etsy only offers the buyer USPS Priority Mail International and Priority Mail Express International.  Just as you say, it doesn't offer First-Class Package International Service. The odd thing is that the shipping profile has the package dimensions, so Etsy could calculate it, but doesn't.  Thank you for helping me to figure it out!"
Etsy,35n73r,randomlygen,2,Mon May 11 22:11:45 2015 UTC,It only showed me the Priority as well. I just think that etsy can't offer all options that the USPS does. It cuts off at a certain size/weight for first class and first class international.  :) Glad I could help!
Etsy,35m51s,ShinyXian,3,Mon May 11 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Some of your photos are unappealing, because it looks like you're using a grey plastic grocery bag as the backdrop.  The crinkles in the bag overpower the subject sometimes, too.  Maybe use fabric instead, to minimize crinkles and look more upscale.  You could go out and buy a nice piece of fabric for it, or just try a fabric shower curtain, or even a solid-color tshirt.  The photos of the bows on your second page are very nice, for comparison!  They're bright and stand out well from their backgrounds, and I can tell what they are from the thumbnail.  as /u/jbbnorth said, read up on Etsy SEO.  Good titles and tags will get you more traffic.  Best of luck!"
Etsy,35m51s,drd4-7r,2,Mon May 11 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you! The silver background is tissue paper, but I can see how it might look like a garbage bag. I will get some better pictures taken!"

Etsy,35m51s,dearwilde,1 point,Mon May 11 22:15:34 2015 UTC,Make sure you take your photos outside in natural light -- it made all the difference for my photos.
Etsy,35m51s,OyoPOP,2,Tue May 12 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"I second this, but it might also be useful to build a light box, since your items are relatively small! I made one recently and it has been a lifesaver for those times when I'm trying to photograph something at midnight or when the weather isn't cooperating (which it never seems to around here!)   There are lots of DIY tutorials on Pinterest if you search ""DIY light box"" (I used white foam board for mine, and it turned out really nicely!)"
Etsy,35m51s,dearwilde,2,Tue May 12 12:10:24 2015 UTC,"I laughed at the ""trying to photograph something at midnight or when the weather isn't cooperating"" ... definitely the story of my life!  My items are too big, but the OP should invest in a light box to remove all the variability!"
Etsy,35m51s,sudodaemon,1 point,Tue May 12 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, I know that feeling way too well. In a perfect world I'd have clear, natural sunshine for at least 4 hours every morning-- and also the time to do nothing but shop photos during that time-- but my shop photos tend to get done between the hours of 8pm to 1am, and sunshine isn't exactly forthcoming during that time. Enter: DIY light box, and a major sigh of relief for me."
Etsy,35m51s,trailscrafts,1 point,Tue May 12 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"Use up your keywords! They give you 13, find 13 to use for every listing. And read up on the SEO for Etsy, it changes from time to time, but you'll find tips about how to write descriptions and listings to improve search results... I want to say they put priority on the first 3 words of your description, so if you're selling scarves, and the first 3 words of your description don't have the word scarf in it you are hurting yourself."
Etsy,35ldub,StairwayToWoodHeaven,3,Mon May 11 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"Your photos do look great!   One thing to consider is that you don't have any product dimensions in your listings, even as a starting point for your custom work.  I'd love to know the size of the products you have in your photo so I cold gauge from there.  What materials are you using for your step stools?  What dimensions do you need from your customers before you can start your work? I think you'll want to make it as easy on your potential customers as possible to make the purchase, so if you include a list of options (things you can personalize, like the type of wood, or the paint colors available) in the listing, as well as what they would need to provide (height of bed?) they can just copy and paste that into an Etsy message or the ""notes to seller"" box at checkout.  Add lots of tags to your product listings. Things like ""girl's stepstool"" ""bedroom stepstool"" ""personalized stool"" -- try to think like your customers and what they might be using to search on Etsy. It will take some practice, but you will get used to it!"

Etsy,35ldub,happyjoylove,3,Mon May 11 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree about the photographs, not that I don't think they look okay, but I don't think they're great because you want to create a general them for your shop with consistency.  Here's an example of a shop with consistency, Here's another example.  Part of it is that you need more items in your shop and you may want to see if you can have someone you know get your first sale out of the way plus a review.  For consistency it may mean having consistent angles of photographing or consistent backgrounds, even the theme of the products, right now the products you have don't really match each other, but again, having more products will allow the consistency to show through.  Good luck!"

Etsy,35l7ja,sbnufc,3,Mon May 11 12:20:50 2015 UTC,"I really like your stuff and I think the price is perfectly fine.  It looks like you're doing the seo stuff right, you have multiple word tags that are the same as your titles and good descriptions. Maybe you aren't getting many views because people aren't actually searching for this stuff or don't know about hand carved wooden hangings...if that makes sense. I know I'd never seen anything like that until I found your shop. Anyway, my advice would be to take just a few listings at first, killer seo but more general sort of terms, like 'wall art', 'country hanging' ....more 'general' terms instead of specific. Put in keywords for wall prints/hangings that people are searching for all the time.  Sorry if i don't make sense."
Etsy,35l7ja,orangebanananaapples,2,Mon May 11 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"Hey there,   I really like your products....As some other redditors have mentioned, I can see that pricing and location may be a deterrent for someone to order from your shop if they are located in another country.   However, as far as getting views and such...it's jsut one of those things where you have to come to terms with the possibility that   1) it takes time and you will eventually get the traffic you're searching for   2) that you won't get any traffic as you haven't found a niche market, and should look about adjusting your shop   I would maybe look at seeing about engaging with your instagram followers, and perhaps ask r/woodworking r/woodcarving for some tips   I think you have a product that would do much better at craft shows then online, because people have the ability to visibly see what they are buying and such.   ALSO totally look into doing Coasters!   I think it would be brilliant if you did coasters that maybe had various states/ countries on it. I would buy a coaster set that had the outlines to my favorite states or states I've visited.   Something that can be used would be great. (bowls, plates, coasters) :) maybe that can help as well!   Edit: Also out of curiosity, what is your girlfriends Etsy store?"
Etsy,35l7ja,saleina,1 point,Tue May 12 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"From an SEO perspective, I was thinking that maybe you could add some tags about the use of the item vs. the production method.  For example, ""Graduation Gift"", ""Manly Gift"", ""Sentimental Location"", etc.  I am tired so I don't represent that these are the best ideas, but they give you an idea of broadening your market reach."
Etsy,35l7ja,OyoPOP,0,Tue May 12 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"The country outlines is the carved stuff?  Not sure I understand what you mean by ""are they actually hand carved or done with a dremel"". If I use a dremel, I'm still doing it by hand. I have used both, sometimes gouges then finished with a tool similar to a dremel, sometimes only gouges and sometimes only the tool.  It's all by hand (ie, not CNC or whatever a computer controlled machine is called that would do it) anyway"
Etsy,35l7ja,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon May 11 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I'll bare that in mind.  Heh, 2 hours.. I wish.

Etsy,35l7ja,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon May 11 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"I know I could, but then they're all the same and it takes away the uniqueness and personality from each piece that the people who have bought them from me like so much about them (or so they've said :D).   I don't want to be the same as any other map drawer or maker by just simply tracing the same thing and repeating  every time. That explains the price a bit more and why I try and make a point of saying ""hand drawn"" when I can, as well.  Anyone can just trace a line anyway, right? :)"

Etsy,35ebfh,piikaaboo,1 point,Sat May 9 14:41:30 2015 UTC,I suggest looking through http://sba.gov. They have great guides for whatever location you're in and what you need to set up.
Etsy,35c83r,RogueVenus,8,Fri May 8 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"I hope this is OK to share.  I'm really exited because I'm on the list. I think Leaves of Three is a Redditor, too?"
Etsy,35c83r,Photinuscarolinus,5,Fri May 8 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"Well, how funny. I have been catching flak from everyone in my sphere for the poison ivy thing, it's definitely a crazypants thing to get into, but it's cool, damn it. And nearly everyone recognizes what it is and wants to touch, flirt, and poke at me when I wear it. It's got it's own special attraction, I swear it.   I'm crazy about your stuff, /u/RogueVenus, thank you for posting this, you made my week-end.   Huh. I'm in an elite group of weirdos. Well, a group of weirdos, anyway. I just love us!"
Etsy,35c83r,sneaky_dragon,2,Sat May 9 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"I had no idea it existed until a follower sent it to me on Twitter. So I re-tweeted her tweet, shared it on Facebook, and I shared a screenshot on Instagram.  Honestly, I'm mostly bragging. The people who follow me already know about my shop."
Etsy,35c83r,myjenaissance,4,Sat May 9 13:20:06 2015 UTC,lol.. Terrible Origami is a redditor as well.   I'm impressed the video games soaps store has lasted this long without having issues with the trademark holders. I thought Nintendo goes on sprees removing items from Etsy.
Etsy,35c83r,myjenaissance,3,Sat May 9 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"I would much rather see 'strange' (however one defines that) on Etsy than resellers from China.  Kudos to all 10 shops for being unique!  Etsy has changed so much recently that it's difficult to find things like this anymore.  I miss the ""pounce"" feature!"
Etsy,35c83r,cutecutecute,2,Sat May 9 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"What was the ""pounce"" feature?"
Etsy,35c83r,k80k80k80,3,Sat May 9 10:23:37 2015 UTC,When you pressed the 'pounce' button it would take you to a random shop - either a new shop that hadn't had a sale (if you selected to pounce those) or just a random shop that did have sales.  I discovered so many neat things that way. Shame they got rid of it.
Etsy,35c83r,terribleorigami,2,Sat May 9 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"Oh! That sounds like so much fun!! It's like the ""random"" button here on Reddit!"
Etsy,35c83r,k80k80k80,9,Sat May 9 19:10:51 2015 UTC,YESSS. I was hoping Terrible Origami would be in that list. That shop is fucking hilarious.
Etsy,35c83r,k80k80k80,8,Sat May 9 19:15:12 2015 UTC,How was I not on this list?
Etsy,35c83r,k80k80k80,3,Sat May 9 01:17:05 2015 UTC,Totally agree. You should be #1 superstar.
Etsy,35c83r,geogabs,1 point,Fri May 8 23:44:16 2015 UTC,You're a tough act to follow.
Etsy,35c83r,combustionbustion,5,Sat May 9 01:32:34 2015 UTC,You 100% should have been. Your shop is amazing. And strange in the best way.
Etsy,35c1sj,happyjoylove,2,Fri May 8 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"What do y'all think of this? I probably buy more than i should on my amazon Prime account, simply because of the free shipping."
Etsy,35c1sj,midlifecrackers,2,Fri May 8 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think it may apply for clothing and fit related items, but generally think people expect to pay a reasonable shipping cost.  You would just be eating into your margins or pushing your price just to cover."
Etsy,35c1sj,Steel_Lynx,2,Sat May 9 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that free shipping (and also free returns) is often what tempts me to purchase from a certain shop since shipping in and to Canada is often so costly.   However, from the ""seller side"", I feel that the benefits of offering free shipping and free returns is not so different than offering a lower price point; both types of strategies only work well if you're making profit from mass of sale as opposed to having a high profit margin. I would love to offer free shipping but, with the # of sales and profit margin I actually have, I would honestly have to ""hide"" the shipping price in the item price and that isn't something I want to do.   ETA: when shopping on Etsy I'm usually more understanding of the fact that it's a small (personal) business and not a big company so flat rate shipping is my equivalent of free shipping on Etsy."
Etsy,35d1qq,littletinypiranha,4,Sat May 9 03:24:12 2015 UTC,I second the idea that I have too many different interests and some people say you should just focus on one style. I just love doing different things! I am also way too criticle on myself.. especially if I dont get a review I think its because they didnt love the product enough. I have to stop overthinking things and just create more!
Etsy,35d1qq,ihaveacutepuppy,5,Sat May 9 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling exactly! I wander into a craft store (or even Walmart or Staples) and I instantly see five things that I think would make the best supplies for my crafting.. until I go back a few days later, and see five more things, and forget about the previous stuff entirely.. and repeat (a lot.) My inner crafter is insatiable when it comes to new supplies.   My biggest flaw as an Etsy seller though is my tendency to hold myself to unreasonable standards, even though I know they're unreasonable. I'm trying to get out of my own perfectionist mindset, and train myself to focus more on learning and growing rather than immediately being perfect at everything (because I'm so, so not.)   I tell myself that someday I'll probably look back and cringe over some of my listings, and the photography, and my descriptions-- but I also told myself that that's okay, because if I'm cringing at old listings, that probably means my new stuff will be way beyond the point I'm at now.   Someday. :)"
Etsy,35d1qq,dearwilde,3,Sat May 9 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"I get that!! I tell myself I don't need anymore fabric... online fabric shopping an hour later lol  For me I find it really hard to take a break, there's always some sewing that could be done, finishing orders, creating new products, answering convos, social media...AH!  I know that I need to take a break from it all once in a while, prevent burn-out.....I'll let you know how that goes ;) lol"
Etsy,35d1qq,orangebanananaapples,2,Sat May 9 05:48:25 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing. I have so much supplies right now, but I at least know I'll use it eventually xD  My worst flaw though would be making social media work for me. I never know what to put and have a hard time writing about myself which I know I need to do."
Etsy,35d1qq,fusedelegance,2,Sat May 9 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in your same boat I actually came to this sub tonight to talk or read about this. Man, do I have an eBay shopping problem. There are a ton of cheap supplies on there and I justify my purchases by my concrete belief that I will make something out of what I am buying and the margin is so good that I can't lose money if I sell just one of what I make.   But I can lose money if I don't make something from the things I buy.   You know what though? I'm gonna keep going with it. Eventually I will figure out what I really want to make and what supplies I need. And the stuff I don't need? I can keep it under my bed until the next time I move and decide I don't need it. Its fine, its not the end of the world. I have been spending significantly less on things and saving them in my cart for later or whatever. After a couple of weeks I either buy them or delete them.  A lot of it is packaging and backing for my products also. I want my stuff to present well. I went on this ribbon warpath recently which left me with WAY TOO MUCH RIBBON. Oops, oh well, I'll live. Try your best to make something out of it. I'm happy to be building up an arsenal even though these creativity-fueled impulse buying sprees have left me in debt. So look out for that!"
Etsy,35d1qq,pokemaster_88,2,Mon May 11 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"""creativity-fueled impulse buying sprees"" .... oh my god, yes. I can relate to that possibly more than is healthy!"
Etsy,35d1qq,dearwilde,1 point,Mon May 11 12:52:16 2015 UTC,I've been strict with myself this year that I won't buy any new supplies until I'm net positive in revenue. >_> It's been hard not to expand and try out new stuff that may or may not pan out.  I think I also need to spend more time expanding inventory and taking better pictures. I have a lot of designs on my computer that I haven't gotten around to actually doing so that I can list the item with a real photo rather than just a digital mockup.
Etsy,35d1qq,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Sun May 10 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"I tend to be very dry and droll when I describe things.  My friends think I should be a stand up comedian, because I can describe the most ridiculous things in few words, with a straight face. But it makes it very hard to write item descriptions."
Etsy,35d1qq,RogueVenus,1 point,Mon May 11 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm slow to post new things. I hang on to them not thinking people will get them or like them. Also, when I do post it and get sort of reserved on my descriptions. For example ""its a thing a made, its this big....so uh here you go""."
Etsy,35b1qm,ohlooksomethingshiny,3,Fri May 8 16:43:16 2015 UTC,Instagram is where I post photos constantly about my stuff in progress. @kathlynhawley I like doing it cuz some of my felts take a while to make.
Etsy,35b1qm,CuriosityK,1 point,Fri May 8 16:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I post about what I'm working on on instagram (my instagram is @htp66).  But I was wondering if people would feel better about the item if they saw progress shots in the item listing."
Etsy,35b1qm,CuriosityK,1 point,Fri May 8 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I wouldn't be able to fit those pics, lol The shots of the various sides of my stuff takes up all 5 picture slots."
Etsy,35b1qm,skunkhaus,1 point,Fri May 8 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"I love that idea, but it's all in the execution, really."
Etsy,35b1qm,lolalaslam,3,Sun May 10 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd include in the listing, but in the shop info and on Instagram are both good places to include that sort of thing."
Etsy,35b1qm,skrunkle,2,Fri May 8 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"I have a few ""behind the scenes"" photos in my ""about us"" page. and when I get custom orders I will post messages to the customer with progress photos of their piece. but I never post photos of unfinished pieces in the listings. I think people could get the wrong impression from that."
Etsy,35b1qm,etourneau,1 point,Fri May 8 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's a cool, behind-the-curtain glimpse that you could offer your customers. I would like it, but I also watch a lot of How It's Made on TV, so... :)"
Etsy,35b1qm,randomlygen,1 point,Fri May 8 16:51:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely! Search on Instagram for relevant tags and I guarantee you'll see loads of awesome behind-the-scenes pictures from your competitors.
Etsy,35b1qm,courtneyj,1 point,Fri May 8 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I would do it on items I sell by mockup instead of an actual picture, only ornaments right now, but I sell pinback buttons so it's easy to come up with 1000 designs but not want to make them all until one sells."
Etsy,35b1qm,Christypaints,1 point,Fri May 8 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think photos of my items being made would be very interesting. Halfway through a chainmail project looks pretty much exactly like when you're finished. That being said, I think progress pictures are great for Instagram, Facebook, and blogs!"
Etsy,35b1qm,littletinypiranha,1 point,Sat May 9 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"I think that if your item looks like it could be mass produced or if it has an interesting production process, it would certainly be worth posting progress photos. I think shops that involve metal work, wood work, or sculpting/pottery type stuff would make interesting behind the scenes photos!"
Etsy,35b1qm,tom8o,0,Sat May 9 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Nope nope nope.  My build process is my IP and keeps my competitors guessing and newbies out of my niche bc it appears complicated.  ""Pay no mind to the man behind the curtain."""

Etsy,35bc3j,fcommerce,3,Fri May 8 18:05:00 2015 UTC,What's the elevator pitch and why do we need this product? :)
Etsy,35bc3j,tom8o,2,Fri May 8 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"Agree. Aside from people wanting to be able to manage multiple stores, what other features are you going to have (on the shop side) that the Etsy seller app doesn't already have?"
Etsy,35bc3j,littletinypiranha,1 point,Sat May 9 03:33:16 2015 UTC,iOS sell on etsy has multiple store support
Etsy,35bc3j,courtneyj,1 point,Sat May 9 03:47:10 2015 UTC,sure but I'm asking about other features aside from multi-store support since I don't have multiple stores anyway.   Unless you meant to reply to someone else asking about supporting multiple stores.

Etsy,35bc3j,Christypaints,2,Mon May 11 20:42:20 2015 UTC,Filled it out :) I have been dying for an android app to manage multiple stores so that would be a huge selling point for me
Etsy,35bc3j,purpleducklingf,1 point,Fri May 8 21:09:44 2015 UTC,Do you have multiple stores so your products can be more specialized or is it some other reason? I've thought about splitting mine up as I explore multimedia/chainmail separately but wasn't sure if this was a viable thing.
Etsy,35bc3j,Christypaints,2,Sat May 9 00:30:16 2015 UTC,"It's because I have 2 very different types of products - jewelry in one store and art prints in the other. It's not too difficult, I like having separate stores."
Etsy,35bc3j,purpleducklingf,1 point,Sat May 9 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I may have to think about this for myself. I'm struggling with getting everything settled and I don't want it to seem disjointed, but I don't want to stop making jewelry or mixed media art.  I appreciate the input a great deal. =)"
Etsy,35bc3j,Christypaints,2,Sat May 9 02:57:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would totally recommend it. It gives each shop cohesion and direction. It's especially nice if you ""invite"" yourself, you get 40 free listings in each shop!!"
Etsy,35bc3j,Christypaints,1 point,Sat May 9 03:39:31 2015 UTC,ohhh! I didn't know that. Can you have more than one store per email address or would it involve getting another whole set-up?
