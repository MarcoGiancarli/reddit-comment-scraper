Like most UTs the skull would be situational and only good against fast moving opponents as oppose to a regular skull which would be for a heal. For example, the LOD blue dragon can be slowed which allows your group to easily kill him on his final phase. You would probably want a back up skull like the t3 which is the most mana efficient."

RotMG,3dwivs,gkvirus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"This. Also clients + auto nexus + reconnecting means that players have very little to worry about. This means the players have no sense of accomplishment when they do something, ether an Abyss, Sprite, UDL, or an Event (unless they get a white). Now for them the hard things about the game and the ones that they feel accomplished by is when the kill another player or when another maxed character dies instead of them.   It's kind of annoying for old players like myself (been playing for 3.3years) to see realm going to shit, but we also have to grow up and move on. You can hate all you want on Kabam and it isn't going to do anything, the don't give a shit about this game, it didn't make them money so they put it aside. It's their game and they can do w.e they want with it.   I still enjoy it and play every now and then, but I also have other games I play. I probably will stop playing realm by the end of this year because it won't be as fun for me. I'm just going to quit, because complaining about a clearly DEAD game does nothing. You guys are all wasting your time with these ""Kabam sucks"", ""The community sucks"" posts. The game is dead, get over it."

RotMG,3dwivs,xStarburstStreamx,4,Mon Jul 20 12:50:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It doesn't help that 'famous' guilds are basically the ones that are the most active and have the most fame. The top 4 guilds in USW3, for example, are all hacker guilds. The guilds with the most fame tend to have members that are not role models for the game, since they spend the majority of their time fame farming and the such. It doesn't help that they end up becoming 'elitist' and less interactive with the general community."

If you do still want to play, I highly suggest turning off chat, making a guild of only yourself (to avoid constant invite prompts) and playing it like that.

I quit like 2 years ago, but 2 days ago I decided to log in again and try maxing a necromancer. I know what you're talking about. I entered my first sprite world and instantly saw someone run through the wall to get to Limon. I then went to uswest to try and sell some skin I didn't need, and I saw multiple people throwing around the ""noob"" insult when someone tried to haggle and there was a price they didn't like. But it wasn't all bad. I entered an abyss with some paladin and me and him cleared it and we worked as a team. We entered 3 abyss's together after that, was actually fun. I then entered an abyss with a paladin later that day and he said ""I'd rather solo, mind leaving pal?"" And I told him ""have fun"" and left. I love this community still, but it's mostly full of 12 year old brats atm because of the pay to win."

But within 5 minutes of playing I already get annoyed of the clienters, notifier users, and the massive crowd of immature players. It's sad now that such players are running many guilds and getting people to ""come to their side"". I guess thats what happens when well-known players who client aren't banned and allowed to spread their filth."
RotMG,3dwivs,BurritoBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"Funny, that's also what I'm playing now. The difference between the two communities is enormous. I think it has a lot to do with ESO costing so much money. Realm is free to play so everyone and his friend can come in. Unfortunately, because of bot spam, most new players see that hacks (that are advertised to make the game easier) are readily available, and so the negative reinforcement cycle continues. More new, naive players means more shit sold via easily accessible RWT, more hacks being used because there's nobody to stop them, etc. It's terrible. I'm pretty much done with Realm. I still love this subreddit and visit it multiple times a day, but the game itself doesn't mean as much to me anymore. 95% of my favorite players and friends quit, so why should I continue playing?"
RotMG,3dwivs,JP3Gz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I’d like to say I’m not part of this shitfest. But alas, the strain of pure shit has caused myself to be a total dickhead as well. Yeah, there were times when people actually cleared oryx castle, and the WC opener could actually get fellow realmers to wait for him/her. And the donates were actually decent, and not junk like t10 wands. Those were the good old times. But they were old times. Now, it seems to me, being cool in realm means to disrespect one another, to use means necessary to be better than anyone else, and then make them feel terrible for being ‘worse’. Honestly, these posts actually get me thinking; maybe I shouldn’t call that Level 19 Knight with resu and bracer an idiot. He sure as heck is better than me, because I’ve never even found a resu or a bracer. Thank you, kind sailor, and I will try my best to reform."
RotMG,3dwivs,israphial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"People respond to incentive. When theres nothing to lose (Kabam doing nothign about hackers) and everything to gain from hacking, leeching, notifying and dragging why wouldn't you? Basically the only thing stopping people is that some people have a sense of decency, and sometimes guild/community shaming. You can't rely on decency alone to stop people from cheating, we need proper punishments and game fixes, but we all know that isn't going to happen because Kabam has let go of the game."
RotMG,3dwivs,JP3Gz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:19 2015 UTC,"I joined RotMG back around February 2012, just a few days before the Ocean Trench came out. Most of my first year or so on Realm was horrific (I wasn't good at it, lol), so I was generally very on and off and not really involved within the community. Nowadays I regret not being involved.  I made very slow progress on Realm until after Kabam's acquisition of Wild Shadow. During the end of the WS era I had been on hiatus from RotMG basically. I started playing RotMG again at the same time that Kabam acquired the game. It seemed alright, but I noticed a worse community at the time. It only went downhill from there, really.   I became a sprite artist more than a RotMG player for a while during 2013 and 2014. I slowly got better at sprite making, but after SwatSec hacked the game it felt like RotMG had just lost its soul. It was an echo of what it used to be, and although I tried to include myself in its community as a sprite artist, it was too late. The community was too far gone to even care. After I released my dungeon, the Asylum (which is basically the only idea I ever really focused on and dedicated myself to), I just decided that I wanted to fade away into the shadows. I was really getting tired of Realm, and my schedule was just getting busier so I realized that the effort I was making was really fruitless. School started and after a while I just left Realm (without making any announcement about it) at around the end of 2014.  I recently jumped on after staying off of RotMG for about half a year. It's just sad to see how far the community has come, especially from the good old Wild Shadow days. I really do miss that time, even though I wasn't remotely skilled at this game. I regret not being active on those forums for the first part of my time in Realm. It's just saddening, really. How many updates have come out since I left? How lively has the community been? How much farther did Realm fall since I left it?  It's really sad. Really."
RotMG,3dwivs,Bondle,0,Tue Jul 21 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"Thing is people are greedy and this kind of behavior rubs of onto other people to. If more people were a lot nicer and actually contributed to the co-op part of the experience such as actively healing and buffing other people to beat a boss rather than for their own self gain, maybe the game would just be all around better. Shitty people=shitty game"
RotMG,3dwivs,JP3Gz,0,Mon Jul 20 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"Plenty of us don't hack, although I am astounded by just how many people do, even the new players seem to just go straight to hacking. It's also pretty shitty when you've been in a realm for ages clearing events and something like a hermit spawns so you switch characters to get soulbound, then get accused of being a notifier with every insult in the book thrown at you. Pretty shitty tbh."

RotMG,3duncp,israphial,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:04 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested. Link please. You may need to PM it if it falls under private server rules, however I don't think it does because it's technically a different game. Your call."
RotMG,3duncp,ExplorersX,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"It isn't available online yet, I am thinking about hosting my own website and putting the game on it.  This is a different game altogether so it won't fall under private server rules. I also don't plan on it being a direct 100% copy-cat of realm, but maybe a copycat as far as how the game mechanics all work, but the content of the game will be different (not drastically tho)  I have a subreddit for the game now at /r/TheRealmProject"
RotMG,3duncp,israphial,4,Tue Jul 21 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"Keep me posted. But I would strongly suggest not to use java as the frontend for the game, go for javascript or html5. Java is a ""great"" backend langage, but not for game clients.  Also, I think it would be great because those private servers use custom made backend servers with the crappy hackable flash frontent, so keep with your idea, should be great!  I would be down for content creation and frontend coding."
RotMG,3duncp,zxcv_rotmg,3,Tue Jul 21 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"This has been stated already, and yes I'm probably going to use HTML5 + javascript."
RotMG,3duncp,israphial,4,Sun Jul 19 20:58:30 2015 UTC,So do you guys want something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0amioXsJTk&feature=youtu.be
RotMG,3duncp,ExplorersX,3,Mon Jul 20 01:42:58 2015 UTC,WELL then. Looks like you beat me to it.
RotMG,3duncp,ExplorersX,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:50 2015 UTC,"Right now I am working on finishing getting the inventory to work. I actually already have bonus effects working for the items (so you can drink potions and equipping chainmail gives a buff to your youth (new version of VIT). I will be adding rollover text descriptions and a map generator in my soon to add plans. There is also a chat feature already in the game (mirroring the one in realm at the moment) and the code is all extremely clean and very easy to read. 1200 lines total for the whole thing.  If people are really willing to invest in this game, I can make some serious progress in the development very quickly if you would like. All the work so far has just been me piddling with it a few minutes a day for a week or two."
RotMG,3duncp,FallFront,3,Tue Jul 21 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! What languages are you using? Did you take some source from Realm, or is it all unique to you? I'm super curious about this. Maybe you and teperc could work together? :o"
RotMG,3duncp,Mizion,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:26 2015 UTC,This was made 100% from scratch. I am using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.  All Unique to me.  Yes I plan on having other people being able to collaborate with me once I get my main framework done.
RotMG,3duncp,LandRz,3,Tue Jul 21 03:10:17 2015 UTC,Shit. Guess who just accidentally backed out of the reply page after typing up a HUGE response? I'm going to take this to PM so I'm not breaking any subreddit rules.

RotMG,3duncp,eremenion,5,Tue Jul 21 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"You guys don't seem to realize the amount of work it requires to code a complete game from scratch...

RotMG,3dv8xs,Dthnider_RotMG,2,Sun Jul 19 20:48:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I can't Muledump it as it isn't linked to a web account as far as I can tell. My first time playing was last night and I hadn't even left the nexus before trying to reopen the game. This is quite confusing.
RotMG,3dv8xs,Dthnider_RotMG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"Hm... does it still ask for login credentials? If so, you should be able to Muledump.

RotMG,3dtaiy,Craig_the_Intern,2,Sun Jul 19 07:04:43 2015 UTC,Do white eggs still drop?  I'm not sure if I've ever seen one.
RotMG,3dtaiy,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Sun Jul 19 06:38:07 2015 UTC,They do.
RotMG,3dtaiy,Suestwo,2,Sun Jul 19 06:54:40 2015 UTC,Crazy.  I've been going out of my way to kill eggs and their inhabitants when I find them in highlands for what seems like two years now with no luck.
RotMG,3dtaiy,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Sun Jul 19 06:58:22 2015 UTC,Wylem I think it was got one a some months ago. Unless kabam changed it in the past months... but kabam hasn't done anything in the past months
RotMG,3dtaiy,Suestwo,2,Sun Jul 19 07:00:58 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is the only reason I wanted one was to see if they still dropped.  I just checked the files from here and found:  <SoulboundLoot prob="".002"">White Drake Egg</SoulboundLoot>  I guess that explains why I never got any.  Rarer than many white bags.  Edit: also the Dragon Egg has:  <Behavior prob="".10"" childId=""Adult White Dragon"">MetamorphoseAtDeath</Behavior>  So the odds of getting a white drake egg drop out of a dragon egg are 1/10 * 1/500 = 1/5000.  Does this make it the rarest item in the game?"
RotMG,3dtaiy,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Sun Jul 19 07:28:14 2015 UTC,It's not soulbound anymore. I got my first (and only) a few weeks ago.
RotMG,3dtaiy,sewer_boy,2,Sun Jul 19 13:11:36 2015 UTC,"26 months ago apparently, but I doubt it's changed. They're just suuuuper rare. And a brown bag drop now. =/  (I think another tester had gotten one recently though, maybe zxcv?)"
RotMG,3dtaiy,Wylem,2,Sun Jul 19 07:38:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got one back in January after a LONG dryspell. Pretty exciting. They used to be for sale for fame, waaaay back in the day."
RotMG,3dtaiy,zxcv_rotmg,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it was that long ago. I started playing RotMG in 2013 I think and I'm 99% sure that the pirate rums and eggs were still for sale.

RotMG,3duhba,eremenion,6,Sun Jul 19 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"While it's technically able to play flash programs, it's not automatically run when you browse websites...which was the security concern of using a flash-based plugin. Using a standalone player to play realm is the best experience anyway, and mitigates those security concerns."

Trust me bud, you won't get any motivating help in this SubReddit unless you make a DBow from foam or draw Bes with tons of detail.  But in my opinion, there really shouldn't be specific rules in any guild.   In reality, people always want to make or be part of the ""best"" guild, so whatever.  I think a guild should be composed of people who enjoy playing with each other and share common interests."
RotMG,3dpf4u,LordFapz,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:44 2015 UTC,So a guild that will play the game its ment to be played?

RotMG,3do8sp,Mizion,3,Fri Jul 17 23:10:25 2015 UTC,That would just feed the multiboxers/account sellers.

RotMG,3dldyn,NN_SS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:51 2015 UTC,I already know about the sprites I mean the game was inspired by realm (stated by creator himself on forums). I was just mentioning that he said the game was inspired by terraria without mentioning rotmg

There was a pretty cool app released about 4 years ago that used the same sprites, so it isn't very uncommon. RotMG, however, is the most popular game to use these sprites IIRC, so people think they are being stolen when they are in fact not."

RotMG,3dh94u,_Sonicman_,3,Thu Jul 16 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't played for the last seven(ish) months and I'm just about to get back into it too! :)  Things you need to know:   Realmeye is the place to go for trading.  You get a great idea of the going rates for stuff, and it makes trading a lot easier than heading to USW to spam. The toughest dungeon, objectively speaking, is the Shatters.  It's dropped by the Avatar of the Forgotten King, a new event that is a big floating head surrounded by four statues.  Very dangerous, it's easy to get shotgunned by.  Sit back the first two or three times and memorize the patterns (it has four phases or so).  Find a Shatters video for details about the dungeon.  Other new dungeons include Shaitan's Lair (pretty tough, one room), Puppet Dungeon (pretty easy but take it slow the first few times), Davy Jones's Locker (easy but open doors cautiously), Lair of Draconis (finally; relatively easy), and the Ice Cave (easy).  Other new events are the Rock Dragon (dangerous, shotgun possible), Ghost Ship (easier but still be careful) and some boss after Stone Guardians in Oryx's Castle that nobody ever fights.  I'm probably missing a few, take a look here just in case. When people talk about 'notifiers', they are talking about a service that shows its subscribers when special events spawn in certain realms, so that people can flood in and leech it; when you're in a 9-person realm and a sphinx spawns, and there's 35 people there in like 15 seconds, that's what's happening.  It's a pretty awful problem. There are special matching item sets for certain classes now, with their own unique statistics and set bonuses.  Most of the full sets are pretty bad but some aren't, see here for more details.  There is also a higher tier of rings now, T6, dropped in the Shatters.  So as far as your gear, you may want to get the next tier of HP ring (called Unbound HP)."

RotMG,3ddliq,Wylem,2,Wed Jul 15 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"The way it works is f you're moving in a straight line for at least ~1 second, confuse won't immediately change your direction. It's weird, because I can't imagine how that could be a bug; seems like it was intentionally coded that way.  In OP's clip he just has his camera angle set so up+right is forward whether he's confused or not. You still have to deal with confuse when you don't want to go straight, but it's a lot easier (and faster to react to) since all you have to do is switch between up and right."

RotMG,3dccy8,phops,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"I think that is probably because of how little it is played by most people. Using the RealmEye Top Characters by Fame list as an example, to get on the list as a Mystic, you need a measly 300 fame. For a Knight? 1840."

RotMG,3db4m9,israphial,7,Thu Jul 16 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, this could quite possibly be the end. I would assume that the vast majority of users play Realm on Chrome, and losing flash capability would force people to switch to another browser, but at that point, is it really worth it? Having to fight through the browser lag and slowness, as well as the inconveience - why bother? But it's all theory. I guess we'll see."
RotMG,3db4m9,Suestwo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"Less players is a good thing (At least until kabam starts to lose significant profits), People can still play on the flash player projector, steam, and other browsers so there's no reason, yet, to call this the ""end""  It's not that big a deal to be that worried about. (again, yet.)"
RotMG,3db4m9,israphial,4,Wed Jul 15 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"Right, but I doubt that the majority of the chrome playerbase knows a thing about projector. Like I said, we'll see where the road takes us."

RotMG,3db4m9,wilandhugs,4,Tue Jul 14 22:27:26 2015 UTC,They can re-construct realm on a different platform. Java maybe? :) But the re-construction of realm will take a quite decent amount of time.

RotMG,3db4m9,israphial,3,Tue Jul 14 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"Can confirm; there are early versions of semi-spaghettified code floating around on the Internet.  With Kabam's wonderful investments of money and man-hours, I'm surprised it's still maintained at all."

RotMG,3db4m9,MeickRMJerne,6,Tue Jul 14 23:15:57 2015 UTC,"On the other hand it's a very good thing to see this god damn Flash turned down in the future. All the games than have been on Flash will be still playable, the updates of RotMG will just stick to the last Flash version or the safest/most stable, same thing goes for online Flash games, the changes will mostly affect game designers who were going to make a huge error a.k.a. creating more games on Flash while there are more efficient (and literally better in like almost any points) languages. Of course I am not speaking about Java. Both languages are usually used for small games because it requires less efforts (still a lot of effort) for a maximum render, it results in extremelly poorly optimised games (Minecraft is the exception) and it limits the possibilities to extend the game.  If we look at the security charts http://i.imgur.com/4TfcDWt.jpg Flash is the #1 most highly vulnerable browser application, forcing people to play on highly vulnerable platforms is not conceivable at all. (feel free to check at the other Adobe siftwares lol).  One a side note (almost offtopic), to those who read the Kotaku news and especially the passage about Steve job accusing Flash as the main reason why their overpriced shits are crashing all the time, here is a small chart of the OS vulnerabilities http://i.imgur.com/zmBHxQZ.jpg , let's say he better not speak, and screw people who think they can't have viruses on MAC.  TL;DR Flash will die and it's a good thing, you will be able to play your Flash games in the future, I have one more reason to hate Steve Jobs."
RotMG,3db4m9,Mrwalrusrotmg,3,Wed Jul 15 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"Mainstream browsers stopping Flash-support wouldn't be that bad, but if Adobe would stop making security updates, well it'd kill Flash. Anyway if it comes to this in 1-3 years, I bet many game devs would be interested making their own rotmg-like game with a supported engine."
RotMG,3db4m9,Le_giblit,3,Tue Jul 14 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know, this doesn't seem to be a thing that will be come true in 1-3 years, it seems it will become in a few months, or maybe before the end of 2015, so, i know this sounds tragic, but maybe Realm will never see the light of 2016."

RotMG,3d7fwr,chaosscizzors,3,Tue Jul 14 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"as i said in the op, you can unhide the 'info' worksheet and unprotect both sheets with the password mentioned above, but i'll list the formulas:  MP used per second is MP cost/(length or cooldown, whichever is longer). The MP cost is as written.  You can get info about length/cooldown from the wiki or from in-game (the latter is more reliable, so long as you know about the WIS mod bug). If the cooldown is longer than the length (ie most cases- qot, cloaks, helms, etc etc) use the cooldown.   If there is no cooldown, or if the cooldown is SHORTER than the length (the only two examples i can think of are stasis for conflict and healing/damaging for oreo) put the length, and if the length is WIS mod-affected, the length is x(1+WIS/150) for >=30 WIS if it is x for <30 WIS.  The MP regen'd by WIS is 0.5+0.06*WIS (I'll do some testing soon to confirm this formula). Now the MP regen needed by your MP heal pet is (MP used per second)-(MP regen'd by WIS), and you can figure out what level you need on this sheet by HeroMax/Krayzie https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQ1S9pX-yxs9yaWLAY_DPb4BVcTDDH1e3mqiL4NP5VA"

RotMG,3d89vs,forfoon,4,Tue Jul 14 07:46:46 2015 UTC,"You already answered your own question. Bow classes are definitely not as strong/effective without uts. If you're unmaxed however, don't even consider using a dbow/cbow. Prioritize maxing your Dex (easiest) then def (farming Dex then selling for 2:1 ). Trible shot bows are just as effective as cbows with a maxed att archer (Maxing your att will make a difference) and I myself find them to be more fun to use than cbow. Cbow is not as needed as dbow.  My advice for you would be to max your stats first (Dex then def )  then start farming Udls with a buddy. Dbows drop at an increased rate atm so start doing then immediately once you're ready."

Damage is spread across three bullets meaning high defence rapes your DPS, and also you need to go in close to get all three bullets to hit. Covert is an adequate replacement for coral bow in godlands.  I wouldn't use rare UTs like doom bow and coral bow before I have maxed that character."
RotMG,3d89vs,Le_giblit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:33 2015 UTC,"Cbow isn't needed, dbow is. You'll find in most late-game situations enemies will have high enough defense that coverts damage won't give you soulbound  If you decide to plow on anyways, a tip for doing FFA tombs with no dbow is to ignore bes completely, as nut and geb have low defense, and everyone focuses bes for pyra anyways so you can usually secure 2 life"

RotMG,3d89vs,chaosscizzors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:09 2015 UTC,I've spoke to a lot of maxed huntresses they say end game huntresses are better (in their opinion) due to AoE paralyze as well as  +spd and dex of it.
RotMG,3d89vs,Le_giblit,-5,Tue Jul 14 23:58:29 2015 UTC,Ive played the game for 3 and a half years on every maxed class and can tell you the  archer is better
RotMG,3d89vs,chaosscizzors,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:14 2015 UTC,it's really more of a preference. i like using archer over huntress because the ability is active instantly as opposed to waiting for the huntress' trap to hit the ground. hitting with the trap is a lot easier and the trap hits a lot more enemies at once. they're both good classes.
RotMG,3d89vs,Le_giblit,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:52:43 2015 UTC,It is preference but opinion isnt relevent when one is objectively better than the other

RotMG,3d89vs,Le_giblit,2,Thu Jul 16 15:21:17 2015 UTC,Quiver has more utility than trap. Its instant and easier to hit with a larger range.   The trap is useful for setting up damage which is irrelevant due to to steamrolling and it used to be bugged allowing it to paralyse the minions in shateers that werent meant to be paralysed.  That and it was needed for the trap fame exploit

The trap is useful for setting up damage which is irrelevant due to to steamrolling and it used to be bugged allowing it to paralyse the minions in shateers that werent meant to be paralysed. That and it was needed for the trap fame exploit   bugs and exploits are irrelevant in this discussion, and how exactly is ""steamrolling"" and argument against one or the other class? both abilities have the same effect and they both ""steamroll"" enemies so it's a moot point."

RotMG,3cuir7,Orihaclon,5,Fri Jul 10 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"If the buyer says it's ""ok"" for the seller to pop the key, then they should pay even if they are crashed.  It's their responsibility to only say it's ""ok"" for the seller to pop the key when they know they won't be crashed.  They can do this by going into a pcave and waiting 30 seconds - if they are getting someone to open in nex/bazaar/realm then they accept there will always be some risk of crashing, even if it's small.  The only time I'd say they don't need to pay when they get crashed is when the crasher(s) are in the same guild as the seller, because that's the only time they can know for sure that the seller was ""in on it""."
RotMG,3cuir7,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Fri Jul 10 22:32:55 2015 UTC,In the situation where neither seller or buyer can be sure the crashers were independent or not i would pay/accept half and call FFA.
RotMG,3cuir7,icksq,2,Fri Jul 10 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"The only way to avoid crashers for sure (except the seller) is to go into a pcave and wait 30 seconds. This is quite inconvenient.  Most of the time I just use my common sense. I get him to pop in bazaar and wait 20 seconds or so in the bazaar after it was popped. If someone comes in right after it was popped, thats a huge coincidence and looks suspicious. If the guys are in the same guild as the seller its extremely suspicious. I don't pay them. Its got nothing to do with the wealth (3 life is nothing to me) and everything to do with giving money to scumbags.  If it looks like the crasher has nothing to do with the seller, I pay the seller. Sometimes the crasher is a friend of one of the persons in my guild. The guildmate called the crasher over even though I told them not to do it. This happened once and I got him kicked. Its a serious issue because it can cheat the seller of his payment and get me a scammer tag on realmeye. No self-respecting advanced player wants to get a tag on realmeye and ruin their ability to buy keys."

RotMG,3cuir7,instancesx1,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"True. If you agree to buy a key in a cloth bazaar, you do so knowing there's a risk of getting crashed. Its a gamble, and refusing to pay when the tomb does get crashed just means you'd rather fuck somebody over than take responsibility."

You can be as selective as you want if you're the seller. Instead of jumping on the first opportunity you get to dump your key on some random douchebag, just take your time. Realmeye your potential buyer. See if his guild has marked scammers. Pass on low rank players."

RotMG,3ctqnc,Kirikomori,2,Sat Jul 11 08:45:46 2015 UTC,The best thing is getting lion archers/jackal priests/Worshipping priests into boss room. Generally works better than scarabs in my experience. Autonexusing from scarabs is pretty easy.  Also dragging nut is a great way to get people killed.
RotMG,3ctqnc,instancesx1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:12:32 2015 UTC,Scarabs dont mean shit when youve got anti-debufs and reconnect.

RotMG,3ctqnc,HolyFridge,2,Sat Jul 11 09:43:32 2015 UTC,Then you're a really shit dragger. You can definitely kill people with autonexus. Scarabs aren't the way but it's definitely do-able. I've killed many hackers by dragging.
RotMG,3ctqnc,Kirikomori,2,Sat Jul 11 10:44:04 2015 UTC,People rating drags and giving drag tips. What has this world come to ?
RotMG,3ctqnc,instancesx1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:42:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can kill them, but only if you instakill, and only the jackal can really do that, everything else does damage too gradually, and you can't really do it with an electric pet.

RotMG,3ctqnc,RotmgCookeyz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"Ehh. Jackals won't really do anything. Best way to drag on a hacker is the calling the room or dragging nut basically. Also just messing the tomb up to hell.  A couple years back before pets there were loads of leechers in a pub tomb that I was rushing and I moved so many mobs into one sarc room it took 4 people nexusing as they got into it to kill some of the scarabs, 1 person dying, and over an hour to clear.

RotMG,3ckjwj,ZackIFair,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"contradicts why warriors lose their debuff   Not really, holding down space constantly applies speedy, so it really comes down to a 'fight' over whether the constant application of the ability or constant removal by the water should win.  Warrior's ability isn't applied constantly so there's no such fight."

Test things out using Pfiffel's Pet Simulator:  http://pfiffel.com/pets/  EDIT Sorry, you can't fix it. See Wylem's notes below."
RotMG,3ck68v,zxcv_rotmg,6,Wed Jul 8 15:38:48 2015 UTC,Pro tip: don't take pet fusing advice from the guy who doesn't use pets. ;)

RotMG,3ck68v,zxcv_rotmg,5,Wed Jul 8 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"There's no way to fully recover from a bad fuse (short of getting it undone by support). Fusing that 60/* with a 70/* will create a legendary with a max of 85, and fusing an 85/* with a 90/* will lead to a divine with a cap of 97.  Of course the game doesn't make it very clear that you can ruin months of work with a couple clicks. One more consequence of that terrible implementation.."
RotMG,3ck68v,Wylem,2,Wed Jul 8 21:53:24 2015 UTC,There's no way to fully recover from a bad fuse   Oh right. Crap! And yet another reason why I think pets are dumb. I'll update my comment. Thanks for the correction.
RotMG,3ck68v,zxcv_rotmg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:00:01 2015 UTC,One more consequence of that terrible implementation..   I sometimes wonder if it was a greedy way to get the people who spent a huge amount of money on pets without thinking about it first to do so twice instead of just once.
RotMG,3ck68v,ROTMGBootzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:03:46 2015 UTC,"Damn that really sucks, i spent so much time and feed (not to mention fame) on that pet and its a real bummer to hear that i wont be able to fix it. Thanks for all your answers anyways!  EDIT (additional question): Would you recommend starting over with a completely new pet, over the fact that in the end it will max at 97 instead of 100?"
RotMG,3ck68v,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"Use the pet fuser (linked by zxcv above) to see what your max at each level will be, and use this to decide if that's good enough for you.  If you're not spending money on pets, keep in mind that the divine levels are irrelevant because you probably will never reach divine anyway.  Also keep in mind that compared to maxing a Legendary pet, two uncommon pets is nothing (actually it's even practically nothing compared to maxing up a rare).  See the thread linked here to see what I'm talking about.  The feed power required to bring a rare's first ability from level 50 to 70 is almost some four times as much as it takes to max an uncommon.  I'm a perfectionist and I'd restart from scratch anyway, but even if I weren't a perfectionist I'd restart from scratch since maxing uncommons is so easy."
RotMG,3ck68v,Wylem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:48:33 2015 UTC,"EDIT (additional question): Would you recommend starting over with a completely new pet, over the fact that in the end it will max at 97 instead of 100?   Absolutely. In addition to what Boot said, ""maxing at 97"" is a bit misleading - there's a lot of other problems it would have along the way. The short version is that it'll actually be cheaper in the long run to start over.  That said, I'd still recommend sending a support ticket to see if they can unfuse it."
RotMG,3ck68v,Wylem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"I figure all their greed was in getting it out as soon as they could so they could start making $$$.

I wrote in to support and Synistrr responded to me, saying that although they do not support mules, he unbanned it as a gesture of good faith.

You are gambling on this chance and the odds are very low. Heal and Magic Heal are so much more useful than the other abilities that spending money, fame or feed power on any pet without these two abilities in the first two slots is a waste. Instead you should farm/trade for humanoid eggs, hatch them until you get one that has the ability combo you want, then feed it using the rewards from the ambrosia mystery box."

RotMG,3cbbf5,zxcv_rotmg,8,Mon Jul 6 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update, that helps me understand a direction to go with the discussion:   what brought about the changing of what constitutes a white bag and what doesn't.   I would argue that simply put, rarity (not usefulness) caused Kabam to decide white-bag status. This was loosened for obvious bad choices, like Cursed Amulets, but caused all ""consumable"" items to be Cyan bags, which I disagree with. Incs should be in white bags. Public drops of gumballs is also silly. I think without clear guidelines or much play experience, Kabam developers who made this last round of changes screwed things up (for the most part).   I'm sure if you dig on the Kabam forums you'd find a detailed breakdown of exactly what changed and what was ""wrong"" with those changes."
RotMG,3cbbf5,zxcv_rotmg,3,Mon Jul 6 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"I think Coral Trap should be replaced with Coral Silk as the 'other' white bag in the OT, and Conducting Wand, the Skull of Esben and Ghostly Prism should just not be in a white bag. That's just my thoughts on some of the whites."
RotMG,3cbbf5,moshuRotMG,3,Mon Jul 6 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"It's mainly based on function and rarity, I think. Cbow shoots fewer shots, faster and ctrap paralyzes, whereas csilk and cring only provide marginal stat bonuses.   However, with greater commonality, rarity can be overruled (bone dagger) and vice versa (shatters rings). They probably could explain their logic better tho."
RotMG,3cbbf5,BNaoC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:45:02 2015 UTC,This  coral silk might be 'more' useful than ctrap but ctrap is rarer. the equipment increases in rarity the more specialised it gets: going from ring->armour->weapon->ability. this is the same with the lab UTs. it would be strange if something less rare was a white bag drop.
RotMG,3cbbf5,Kirikomori,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"This  And because they aren't regular tiered drops, the only other option was to make them UT, but like you said, white bag UTs are rare, so to make it so you don't get disappointed and so you understand the rarity, they make them light blue bag drops.  The white bag wouldn't be as rare as it was right now, and nobody would really care."

RotMG,3c8hx1,unknownvar-rotmg,4,Sun Jul 5 23:22:35 2015 UTC,"Dbow hunt and sin are my favorite classes to tomb with.  You probably aren't too worried about rushing, so the bosses are all you probably need to care about.  Learn the way they rotate and how the phases work; with experience, you'll be able to anticipate artifacts and rages so that you don't pop when they come out.  Sin is pretty easy to get loot with in medium to small tombs (just throw your poison ahead of the bosses), but sometimes it can be hard to get loot in big tombs because your damage is dealt over time.  Remember to always keep a full stock of mp pots - if you're planning a tomb, you can take more than six with you by dragging an item in your inventory on top of a potion on the ground.  Use your dagger's range and your speed to quickly get in and out of the inner circle for extra damage - and don't spend time in quicksand or you risk getting mobbed by scarabs and artifacts later on.  Hunt is pretty much great at everything.  In an ffa tomb, chain-paralyzing a boss (or more than one) near a good place to stand can rack up tons of damage. (But don't stand too close!)  Short-range classes often need to move with the bosses to get more effective range, so paralyzing the bosses can both help your chances to snipe and hurt their chances of loot.  Other than that, the same advice about being careful of rages and artifacts still stands.  You'll probably want to move around the outer circle with the bosses, dipping in a tiny bit to make sure your shots hit.  Piercing will give you a big leg up during the artifact phases.  The most important thing is practice. After ten tombs or something, you'll be doing a lot better.  As always, don't ffa if people want a clean tomb, and don't be afraid to pop a loot drop potion right before the bosses activate."
RotMG,3c8hx1,Equinoxbear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:45:53 2015 UTC,Thanks so much it helped a ton! For hunt do you suggest focusing just one until it dies?
RotMG,3c8hx1,Kelrocks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:09:38 2015 UTC,"i would recommend trying to paralyze (or slow) the bosses together, so your bow can hit more than one boss at a time  edit: oh and make sure you aim at nut first because it becomes vulnerable 3 secs before the others"

RotMG,3c8hx1,voodoo-Luck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:27:23 2015 UTC,How do I secure my damage as a low damaging class - priest and necro (mainly priest) come to mind?
RotMG,3c8hx1,unknownvar-rotmg,2,Mon Jul 6 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"The normal strategy is usually ""get there early"" - so if you're doing WCs or similar rush events, max speed and see if speed sprouts suit you.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can really do in the current meta.  Avoid really crowded realms (hard to do with notifiers these days) and work on your dodging abilities so that you can stay deep longer than other people.  Know your SB thresholds for bigger quests.  It doesn't need to be exact, but knowing that you need around 2k damage on O2, for instance, allows you to figure out about how many shots you need to hit.  If your priest has a cwand, look up the defense thresholds above which is it more effective than a recomp.  You probably won't be getting stone guardians loot anytime soon, but it's good to know anyway."
RotMG,3c8hx1,voodoo-Luck,2,Mon Jul 6 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"haha thanks. I have my priest as a backup class and for maxing (other classes and himself), but I wasn't getting a ton of loot. I suppose I should have known why."

RotMG,3c8hx1,Kelrocks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"on abysses: sin is a pretty bad class for abysses but if you do want to do them you should be waiting on your poison to take out rooms because sin is so squishy at short range and has nothing to protect it (like rogue's cloak, trickster's decoy, slowing traps, stuff that other leather classes have). it's nice to get a bone dagger too because enemies are so packed in abysses and it's kinda hard to stay far away from enemies because they chase you.  your two stats that you should max next, assuming you're including trading for pots are def and spd. cems and pits are pretty easy for assassins, but do keep in mind that assassin's two biggest strengths are WCs and public tombs, so keep your eyes out for such end-game content."

If you are solo, then the boss is a guaranteed speed drop, with occasional drops of snake skin armor, shield, ring, etc. For more information on the Snake Pit, check out its wiki page: https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/snake-pit"
RotMG,3c8hx1,sourwyrm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:58:08 2015 UTC,I should have been more explicit.  I meant what is the % that the entrance to the Snake Pit will drop when you kill the corresponding enemies.
RotMG,3c8hx1,Le_giblit,0,Thu Jul 9 13:40:50 2015 UTC,No one knows but its probably similar to the drop rates of that of the pirate cave and spider den since they're reasonably rare so probably like 1/100

Y = 90 after 80 stuns at which point you'll have to wait for regen and your stun is over.   Also you need to take into account that someone isn't realistically stunning at exactly every 2.5 seconds so it's much less than that. So while you'll have enough stuns for most  things or with things with lots of people, it's not a perma stun.    Side note I can be wrong since i did all this in my head"

If your not maxxed in def then, go for Def / Abyss Runs.  Speed and Dex gets you farming faster, makes you move away from bullets faster and increases your dps overall. So get those stats up.

RotMG,3c1jf1,mcfan1234,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Servers cost money too, so consider your pricing structure with these costs in mind:  One ""small"" server on Amazon EC2 costs $0.026 per hour which comes out to $18.72 for 30 days. A ""medium"" server costs twice that, so $37.44 for 30 days. I don't know which server size they use but that gives you some ballpark range. They have to pay for bandwidth on top of that, and I don't know what that cost might be, but let's just say it's under $1 for personal servers.  If you want the server to be dedicated (not shared with other groups of players) you'll need the pricing to be at least that much. If we assume they use small servers, and we need to raise $19.72 per month, then at $2 per player per month you need 10 friends to buy the server together before it stops being a money-losing proposition for Kabam. If players pay for more months at a time, you can get some discount from Amazon, but probably need larger group given that you're proposing larger discounts to players than what Kabam has to pay Amazon. It's unlikely that a permanent membership would ever work out financially — you can't pay Kabam $19.99 once and expect Kabam to spend $20–40 every month forever.  If you are planning servers to be shared, then you can reduce the costs, as long as not all players are playing at the same time. They can shut off the server when 0 of the 10 members are logged on. The less players actually play, the more feasible it becomes. You may run into a situation like the internet and cell phone companies that limit the most active players with bandwidth caps or throttling (and then everyone would hate Kabam even more than they already do)."

Right now, literally the only thing that will ""fix"" realm is massive amounts of money. Kabam is a company, and companies need money to expand. Right now, realm is not a core game and so it has no development team. The developers have been put on other, better projects (ex. ones that make money) and until Realm starts making enough money to justify putting a development team back on it, it's not going to happen. Kabam needs a ROI (return on investment), and putting a dev team on Kabam just doesn't give a good ROI. Simple as that. Thus, the only way we can help is to buy ridiculous amounts of gold, but at this point, do you really want to? I don't. I'm no longer interested in supporting Kabam. If the game gets sold, maybe, but Realm is never getting another cent from me otherwise."

I don't care if you come into the dungeon as long as you ATTEMPT to clear/progress the dungeon. Unless there is one clear way to the boss room and you have less speed than the other person doing the dungeon. I also never take pots from someone that tries to give me them if I get 0/2 and they get 2/2 or whatever. Trying to give someone pots is definitely nice though. I just decline because if I know they're nice enough to give me the pot then that's good enough for me.

It is also useful in situations in which soulbound is not important WHATSOEVER, such as glands farming, where gods have so little hp and time isn't a problem.

RotMG,3bxyh9,Kirikomori,2,Fri Jul 3 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"Doku essentially renders ray katana obsolete. Ray Katana has about 1 tile extra range but about half the DPS of doku. Therefore for Ray Katana to be more viable than Doku that extra one tile range must enable you to hit the enemy for twice as long, and I can't think of any situations where this would be the case. In addition you might be able to make the argument that Ray Katana's extra range gives you more safety, but also consider that it will take twice as long to kill the enemy than with doku and therefore you are exposed to twice the duration of danger."

On the other hand, not everything is ""rooted in idiocy"". Some people may be making a valid point, unlike those conformists. I admit most comments are completely idiotic, but at least listen to their advice. I think the main reason why some people actually hate you is because you're too condescending. Meicklol's video ""Everyone in this dungeon is shit"" is a good example of that. American society celebrates humbleness and vehemently detests arrogance.

RotMG,3bsjzl,israphial,4,Thu Jul 2 01:34:32 2015 UTC,"Beautiful.  Some problems:   Enemy shot range would be nice (how close does the Black Moon need to be from sitting directly on you for it to be an instakill?). The miniboss seems to punish low DPS classes who can't kill those blue things fast enough. The switch mechanic seems like it rewards people who sit by a door.  Possible solution would be to make the switch work like tomb switches ... you have to sit on it long enough, and then the door opens ... just add a delay between the ""click"" and when the door opens so that the person at the switch can catch up to the leecher (or is teleporting enabled?). Boss spawning walls: what happens if you're on a tile where a wall spawns? Follow bots seem overpowered at the last boss.  If you think you're going to dodge one but it just grazes you, then you get confused and probably get hit by 3-4 others that you were dodging before you can react, so it's an insta death. Add Saturn and you get the 6 planets humans knew about before the invention of telescopes :)   Apart from that, looks super fun.  I'd play the shit out of this!"
RotMG,3bsjzl,X-Death,2,Thu Jul 2 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"Enemy Shot Range   Yeah, I wanted to come up with this, but I was very very tired to even want to add this in. The black moon is activated when you are within 6 tiles in it's radius.   Mini Boss and Low DPS Issue   I made that these Planetary stars do not move, and yet they have low def that damage can be dealt quickly. The planetary wizard moves fairly slowly when spawning these so it can give every class plenty of time. Even while soloing.   Switch Mechanics   I actually wanted the switch to work this way. It forces a co-op(ish) feel so that one person can push forward and you can continue working the dungeon. Teleportation is enabled here.    A boss that spawns walls.    Yeah, this seemed crazy when I first thought of it.But I liked it so much that I wanted to keep it. The planetary stars are a indication of where the walls will spawn. You want to make sure you stay clear of those stars at all costs. If caught in a wall, you'll be kicked from the game. (Just like the closing bridges in shatters.)   Follow Bots   I might have added a little too many in that photo. I'm thinking 2-3 might be a fair enough number.   Saturn   Actually, I have tried many, many times to get a decent looking Saturn sprite, and it's very hard. That ring around the planet is virtually impossible. At least for a 16 x 16 sprite.  EDIT: Minor gramatical fixes."

RotMG,3bleti,getslammed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:46:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely get huntress over archer.

RotMG,3bleti,Kirikomori,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"True, but it's nice to have an immediate paralyze when in a pinch. Traps can also be set to lure enemies into them. Why not both?"
RotMG,3bleti,getslammed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:06:47 2015 UTC,What would you want to paralyse which a huntress can't? Paralysing blue mages does nothing except make it so melee can't hit it without taking bullets.
RotMG,3bleti,Kirikomori,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:02:54 2015 UTC,"It's actually very easy to hit paralyzed mages on melee as long as you weave through the shots while staying at 3.5 range. Both classes can paralyze/slow, the only difference being AOE/piercing line. AOE is negligible, and having an instant slow/paralyze is invaluable when a mage comes barreling at your unsuspecting team from an obscure angle. Overall, if you're good with shatters, you don't need a Huntress/Archer in the first place.  Note: Archers also do more DPS than Huntresses, albiet minute."
RotMG,3bleti,getslammed,0,Wed Jul 1 05:10:31 2015 UTC,"It's actually very easy to hit paralyzed mages on melee as long as you weave through the shots while staying at 3.5 range.   Thats a big if imo, as the dense packs of shots can be impossible to weave through and if you get hit you're confused/darknessed/unstabled. If this is the case show me a video demonstrating this. The difference is basically the same as fighting a tomb boss when its paralysed vs when its orbiting like normal, in the latter situation the boss runs into your shots as you run backwards giving you more effective range.   having an instant slow/paralyze is invaluable when a mage comes barreling at your unsuspecting team from an obscure angle.   Archer is actually inferior to huntress for this. Hunt can lay down many cheap t0 traps in anticipation of this, but archer has to aim a quiver at a fast moving enemy coming at you from an obscure angle."
RotMG,3bleti,Kirikomori,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:39:11 2015 UTC,"show me a video demonstrating this.   I don't have a video on hand, but I can assure you it truly is easy. The next time you go to a shatters, lrn2dodge.   Hunt can lay down many cheap t0 traps in anticipation of this, but archer has to aim a quiver at a fast moving enemy coming at you from an obscure angle.   If a mage comes at you unsuspectingly from an unknown angle, you can't lay down traps in time before it comes to hit you, while an Archer can insta-paralyze/slow it if seen. You could play safe and place 10 traps around you every time you take a step, but let's be realistic here. Laying down a T0 trap in anticipation vs. quick slowing with a quiver is virtually the same because the quiver pierces and can be shot in quick succession.   Ultimately, it all depends on how good your Archer/Huntress is. I do daily shatters with a very skilled group of players. In most of my runs, I can assure you that Archer trumps Huntress 100% of the time. The only situation in which Huntress might be better than Archer is when the king spawns his guards, but even then, the Huntress only saves you 15-25 seconds on that single phase (the AOE paralyze is also weakened by the fact that only 1-2 guards can be focused at a time, making multiple paralyzes almost useless).  I'm done arguing, but IMO Archer is the better choice. If you want, hit me up with a PM and we can run a shatters one day (you're paying, of course)."
RotMG,3bleti,getslammed,0,Wed Jul 1 06:02:13 2015 UTC,"I'm done arguing too. Theres no point in arguing with someone whos already made up their mind to disagree. You're arrogantly implying that I'm wrong and that I lack skill, and you also outright incorrectly claim that paralysing the king's guards only saves a small amount of time (in fact you can paralyse the guards and pierce through all of them with your doom bow and save quite a lot of time). And its not difficult to lay down t0 traps in anticipation of a bad drag, theres only two areas where you really need to do this (before the second and first bosses). Its not even a matter of opinion, huntress is better than archer in shatters."

Your i7 is probably better at single core performer than the old C2D architecture. Here's the real problem based on my assumption of your setup: I presume your MacBook is a retina MacBook and you're using scaling in windows. Meaning instead of running the game at 800x600, you're scaling it to 1.5x that if not more, and flash supports scaling meaning you're rendering a shit ton more pixels instead of just stretching the rendered image.  To answer your other questions: - using the latest flash player will give you the best performence - flash is unaffected by c++ redists - applications targeted to x64 will simply run as fast or faster as their 32 bit counterparts because there are more cpu registers to take advantage of - page file is irrelevant in this situation - the renderer rotmg uses is a software renderer, therefor gpu isn't even used"

RotMG,3bfzoc,simsdoren,5,Mon Jun 29 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"I usually use a farmer with this method, but if you don't have them just use your knight. 1. Level 20 a good roll on knight (Level 20 any roll on farmer too if you have one) Equip decent gear: archon, Mithril, veng, para def/hp   CLEAR sprites, (looking for those attack dropping purple guys), gland farm in between, and do a few snake pits if you want to mix it up. Sell dex 3:1, speed 2:1 and atk 1:1 for def. Drink def on knight. Once you have ~15 base def on knight, Rush snake pits to max speed. Then go back to steps 2 and 3 to max about 20 def. Once you have ~20 base def on knight, Rush sprites to max dex.  Then go back to steps 2 & 3 to max 5 more def. In sprites try to get as much attack as possible from native sprite gods to max attack. You can sell dex 3:1 for attack if unsuccessful. Once you have ~25 base def on knight start slowly clearing Abby's at a quick pace to get ~35 base def and higher vit. Causiously rush udls looking out for slimes and septavious's shotgun phase to max wis. Return to cautiously rushing Abby's to max your def and vit.   DONT FORGET RISK V. REWARD!

I can comfortably 6/8 characters through farming in about a day and equip them with tops in another day or two. However, when I begin to try to 7/8 or 8/8 a character (through public tombs/trenches), I end up dying on the way. How do I get past this to get my first 8/8?

RotMG,3bfzoc,Kirikomori,2,Mon Jun 29 12:27:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think most people max 8/8 by farming tombs and trenches, they do it by farming easier content and buying the life/mana. It takes a long time and it actually takes a lot of skill and experience to be able to survive through that many tombs and trenches.   That being said, you should practice doing tombs and trenches on cheaply maxed, cheaply equipped throwaway characters until you have enough skill to be able to take your valuable characters in and survive. Note that a 4/8 character has 90% of the power of an 8/8 but with 1/3 to 1/2 of the cost. My motto: die cheaply and learn from each death."

RotMG,3bfzoc,jjdxnyjj,2,Mon Jun 29 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"I would look up some guides on how to solo abysses using a warrior or knight (recommended for beginners, since you can solo on almost every class, if not every).

That means of you count 5-6 seconds and then chuck poison (aim for center of circle of you don't see them), you should get a poison in. It takes three to qualify (citation needed) for loot.   Equipment- I think felwasp will serve you better if you want to go pure volume of throws in that window, but your specific assassin and pet are probably maxed. Ring- coral ring or exa wis is fine if you only want to throw poison. I stick with expo.   If you ever get lucky enough to nab a plague poison, you pretty much can print money in a tomb.

I recently got a Conduction Wand and thought that I should make a sorc, but I'm having second thoughts.  Also when I ask ""Will I get loot on it?"" I mean in public dungeons like Trenches and Tombs, I haven't spent a penny on the game yet and I don't feel like using money to buy keys yet."
RotMG,3bfzoc,eatmetoday,0,Fri Jul 3 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Its DPS is not particularly high, the thing which it excels at is spreading a small amount of damage to many targets which means its not so good for fighting bosses which is pretty much the main source of loot in the game. You can, however, get quite a lot of loot if you take it to the elder train, especially if you pop a loot drop potion, ecause the train compensates for your weakness (not being able to kill gods quickly).  T12 wand generally supersedes conduct in so many circumstances that carrying conduct is not worth the inventory slot it takes up.    You can't get loot on it in a public OT unless its has few people or you get a dying thessal (which drops coral gifts) but its a pretty good dirty tomb class."

RotMG,3bfzoc,eatmetoday,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:02:04 2015 UTC,They are still being rolled out. It is taking a long time because Nullbot slowed down the rate of the giveout because it was lagging the servers. Nullbot will post an announcement when the rollout is finished.

RotMG,3bfzoc,Kelrocks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:37:47 2015 UTC,"Spectral v Hydra  Heard spectral isn't that good, but idk"
RotMG,3bfzoc,eatmetoday,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:28:24 2015 UTC,I only use spectral on Rogue because most of the time the ability to tank damage is not an issue. Other classes (trix/archer/hunt) will tank damage regularly or rarely use the dagger at all (assassin). Some peope like to put spectral on archer/huntress so they have a bigger chance of one-shotting certain gods in the godlands but I find this to be not worth it: it is better to wear hydra and be able to drag larger godwalls to pierce through than to be able to one shot a god sometimes.
RotMG,3bfzoc,SoBakedRN,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"the problem with spectral is the fact that it just doesn't give enough def. 3 def might not seem like a lot but it really is quite significant to survivability, while 3 atk+3 dex vs 5 dex isn't a massive DPS difference at all. the other factor to take into account is that spectral gives +3 spd. that's nice and all, but i would rather use csilk if i wanted spd for the most part. do you have csilk?  trying to ohko gods with dbow+spectral+idk a pyra/bracer/crown or attack ring is a bad strategy because you really should be using a trishot bow (or cbow) in godlands. the problem with gods is that they have low damage thresholds, but high thresholds in comparison to their total HP. so low that the thresholds (to the best of my knowledge) never even exceed 400 damage, and dbow just does too much damage. it's better to do 500 damage on two gods than it is to ohko one god and do no damage to the other.  also, just to address one more thing, it's definitely not worth carrying spectral as a swap for hydra, you're better off carrying a spd ring or an offensive ring."

RotMG,3bb13w,lordofthekeks,0,Sun Jun 28 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 18, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway."

RotMG,3b5yx1,Kirikomori,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:09:30 2015 UTC,You only need to wait 30 seconds. Waiting 5 minutes is too excessive and will probably piss off the key seller.

RotMG,3b5yx1,Kirikomori,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:05 2015 UTC,The portal closes after 30 seconds (70 seconds for shatters). Waiting longer than that is completely unneccesary and just wastes you and the seller's time.
RotMG,3b5yx1,DGYYY,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it completely unneccesary due to amount of modded client users there is in RotMG at this moment. As I said, when I buy keys I like to make sure I get for what I paid for and don't have problem waiting 4-5 minutes."
RotMG,3b5yx1,Wylem,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:10:52 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could wait a few minutes before paying them so they can't reconnect (I'm not sure what the exact time window is, but 3 minutes should cover it). But that's a big inconvenience for the seller."

RotMG,3b4cws,TheRealPatBoyle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:40:16 2015 UTC,Would it be a good idea to try to unlock the knight and play that class? and what mobs do i have to kill to open the snake pit? Forgot to mention that i died :/
RotMG,3b4cws,alchzh,2,Thu Jun 25 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend the knight if you are just starting out. You'll have a hard time surviving in godlands on a melee character without either a decent pet, or maxed stats. If getting loot and surviving is the issue I would recommend either the necromancer, priest, or the wizard. Each class has long enough range that you can safely dodge most of the enemies, and their abilities will help you. The priest and necro has it utilities that benefit survival, and the wizard can use his utility and almost always deal enough damage for soulbound if you're accurate with it. Use these classes as a mule to farm up pots for a second character, rather than maxing itself. This way if the necro, wizard, or priest dies you aren't losing all your progress. Good luck."

You can build your mule on the one account, the character made to just survive and farm potions, and one by one trade over the potions onto your main account until they begin to get maxed. I would recommend maxing defense first always, then go whichever is most available."
RotMG,3b4cws,CabbageSlut,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:47:27 2015 UTC,should i be buying gear or maxing first?
RotMG,3b4cws,Dj_Crothus,2,Thu Jun 25 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"Do a couple snake pits (They drop from these guys just outside of godlands) and sell the 2 speed for gear. You should be able to buy a t10 armor, t10 weapon, t4 hp/def ring, and a T5 ability. They each sell for a Defense potion each but you might be able to find better deals on realmeye.

RotMG,3b2lga,Epic_Platypus12,5,Thu Jun 25 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"In order to cloak every time your ability is off cool down with a twi/ghostly you need to regenerate 85 mana every 6.5 seconds. Assuming 52 wis with a ghostly your wis alone will regenerate 3.62mp/s or 23.53mp/6.5s. This leaves us needing our pet to regenerate 61.47 more for us to have 85 ready for the next time our cloak is off cooldown. This would require your pet to heal at least 9.45/s. To truly permacloak it would need to be level 72 (9.97/s), but a maxed rare at lv 70 still gives you 8.68/s, bringing you to 79.95 in 6.5s, only costing you 6 mana each time you cloak assuming you don't wait AT ALL between cooldowns. Maxed rare works perfectly fine for tiered cloaks. Chaining a Planewalker is a different story as it costs another 15 mana each time and doesn't have the wis bonus from the ghostly. 50 wis gives you 22.75 mana over 6.5s so your pet needs 77.25 to chain your cloak, requiring 11.88/s or level 77. (76 works perfectly fine however as this gives you 11.76)  TL;DR with ghostly/twi lv 70 maxed rare works as an almost permacloak, only losing you about 6 mana each time. To do the same with a Planewalker you need just over lv 75 to chain the same way."

RotMG,3azd6t,yungdroo,6,Wed Jun 24 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. My first thought is about the stones. Its an interesting concept. My only beef with it is that getting something rare, then having to spend fame on it, then paying to activate it, only for one event kinda seems like a shitload of work for something kinda small. Just my first reaction, I'm not saying that its bad, just that I myself would refine it(still and interesting and unique idea though). Also, I do love the arena point concept especially the stackable consumables ideas (10/10 WOULD PAY TO HAVE INGAME), and the fact that there are some awesome people out there generating and sharing cool and new ideas!  Edit: Thought stones disappeared once used. Once I realized that I'm an idiot who can't read, I love the idea!"
RotMG,3azd6t,TheWamper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your feedback bro! Always thrilled to see people take the time to read my ideas. After you brought it to my attention, I read through all the steps and now think I got a little carried away. What do you think about the ""blessing"" part being taken out entirely? If you just get a stone then mount it in your hall?"
RotMG,3azd6t,TheWamper,2,Wed Jun 24 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Now that I've realized that they're permanent, I think your idea is pretty solid. It was only when I was under the impression that stones gave one use that I thought it was too much work. I think its great as is, but the price that it costs to use a stone to open an event would need to be VERY CAREFULLY chosen - too low, key sales plummet and event UTs everywhere, while too high, nobody give a fuck and gets pissed at you. As long as that price was well chosen, I love the idea.   Curious, would you have the stones be soulbound? I ask because some players prefer to play alone, so what good does a guild item do them? I realize they could still use it to give solo events, if they create a guild only for them self, but stones may not be useful to solo players, and if soulbound its kinda useless. Just a thought I had and was wondering if you had given any thought to it, would love to hear your thoughts!"
RotMG,3azd6t,TheWamper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"I wanted them to be soulbound just because it would suck for them to get duped. But like, a solo player could still use it and just be in a guild by him/her-self. Also there's the option of feeding it. And you brought up a really good and valid point in your first paragraph. I think the real controlling factor in this would be guild arena points, and it would be very tricky to come up with a static value that would allow people to participate but not necessarily farm. That being said, i think the best way to do this would be to have the price increase per spawn per event and then reset once every 24 hours. Every time you spawn an event it costs 2.5x more than the last time. This would make it pretty reasonable for a solo player to do a sphinx or two a day, a decent guild to do 5 sphinxes a day, but impossible for anybody to do 50."
RotMG,3azd6t,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Wed Jun 24 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about price increases after I made my comment, and I came to this: First spawn costs x. All subsequent spawns cost 1.5 times the last spawn price, but prices could be brought back to the start of the sequence by using another stone of the same type. No cost to reset back to price x, you just give it the stone and poof. I think this would keep this whole mechanic from being a massive machine that top guilds could use to gain hoards and hoards of life/mana, which wouldn't be good for an already......unstable....economy.   Another thought - if I was going to implement something like this in RotMG, I would make it so that you CANNOT use gold to get events once you have a stone. You MUST pay with gains from playing, such as fame/arena points (I'm aware this would make fame farming more popular than ever, but that's a whole nother can o worms). I think it would need to be this way because if people are willing to pay hundreds and hundreds of $$ from pets and stuff, I can see people spending large sums of gold on this, which, in turn, would effectively be selling event UTs to the fattest spenders. As the community has flipped the fuck out over small, meaningless shit like the nexus, I do not think they would take kindly to basically selling juggs and qots and other event whites."
RotMG,3azd6t,Mrunibro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"would effectively be selling event UTs to the fattest spenders   Better than selling them to notifier users.  Oh and Kabam doesn't even get that money, thieves do.  But yes I see your point."
RotMG,3azd6t,Mrunibro,2,Thu Jun 25 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"So a stone is usable infinitely as long as you have the points or just once?  Cool idea, makes $$ and people would actually do arena!   private events. Good luck trying to notify yourself into my guild hall!"

RotMG,3az5of,Kirikomori,3,Fri Jun 26 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"i think the best thing we can do is write up a plan on how we can crowdsource programming labor for the game. in other words, a plan on how we can implement user-designed content, such as mods, dungeons and bug fixes. theres so much people who love this game but so little resources to continue working on it, so this is the perfect solution. also it might make the community complain less, because it teaches the community how hard it is to deal with the code and also if the content was designed BY the community you can't really complain."

RotMG,3az5of,Dj_Crothus,10,Wed Jun 24 18:35:06 2015 UTC,Hey.....you can give him criticism..  But atleast he didnt abandon the game.  Atleast he tryed to actually continue momtg  Atleast he still communicates with us.  And all he gets in return is people giving him criticism.
RotMG,3az5of,craqqqqqqqqqq,8,Wed Jun 24 19:08:20 2015 UTC,People aren't really mad at Nullbot. People are mad at Kabam. He has already said he doesn't have the power/knowledge to produce content. So what we are really upset with is the lack of attention this game receives and how all we are stuck with is a moderator. We criticize to show our overall disappoint in Kabam as a company. We want change and Nullbots poor gifts outrage us because we know he is the only one that slightly cares. This has been a terrible month that has brought out the worst in both Kabam and the community. Something drastic needs to happen to save this game and I personally hope it is selling this game or making Pay to Play.
RotMG,3az5of,Dj_Crothus,2,Wed Jun 24 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points, yes we could've gotten better gifts and overall a better Momtg.  But I sure as hell know Nullbot did not have the intention to give us poor gifts."

RotMG,3ayan0,CANT_STOP_CAPSING,5,Wed Jun 24 14:49:56 2015 UTC,HP is a really crucial stat and can be the matter of life and death.   That time you didn't manage to nexus in time might've been managable with 20-40 more HP.
RotMG,3ayan0,wawawa_rotmg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"Did you ever nexused with less than 40hp ? If not, then 40hp doesn't change anything."
RotMG,3ayan0,ROTMGBootzilla,2,Wed Jun 24 20:02:55 2015 UTC,"I agree - especially for a new player that will likely be dying at below 200 fame and where an extra 40 hp will never actually save them before they did.  Once they are better it might make sense to roll a bit, but keeping in mind that time spent rolling could be time spent earning potions to buy life."

RotMG,3ayan0,wawawa_rotmg,2,Wed Jun 24 21:06:41 2015 UTC,"Did it happened frequently ?  It didn't happened a noticeable amount of times for me, so I find it way more efficient to just max to 6/8 with the life pots than using it to max hp, but that's just how I see it.  Thus why I don't think a -20 roll is that bad. I kept -20/+10 rolls because I value mp more than life (since you always use all your mp yet you have to keep some hp to stay alive :p)"
RotMG,3ayan0,CANT_STOP_CAPSING,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:19:27 2015 UTC,A lot of times.
RotMG,3ayan0,Flawks,5,Wed Jun 24 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"A life pot is about 8 defence pot, which is 16-24 normal stat pots (speed, dex, etc). 5 extra life is a big deal.   TLDR: Try to roll at least 15+HP at lvl 20 and do not care about the rest.  Explanation and personal advice: Look at the rolls every level. Look at your starthealth (example 100 for wizard) and if I go below average for my level I start over. Average is 25 per level, where 20 is the least you can get and 30 is the most you can get.  Scenario 1: I hit level 2 and get 122 total HP. This is below average since 125 would be average for this level. Delete, make new.  Scenario 2: I hit level 2 and get 127 HP. Good. I hit level 3 and i have 149 hp. This means i've went from good to BELOW AVERAGE for my level, where 150 for lvl 3 would be average. Delete, new.  Scenario 3: I get 127 at lvl 2. 152 at lvl 3. 179 at lvl 4. This is looking good. and then 199 at level 5. Below average, delete, new.  Scenario 4: You actually stay on the + side all levels. Hope it goes up to 15+ at level 20!  If you know how to follow in the fame train leveling chars shouldn't take very long. If you are new you will most likely die on your characters eventually when learning new dungeons etc. Thats rotmg.  Hope this helps!"
RotMG,3ayan0,eatmetoday,2,Wed Jun 24 15:13:40 2015 UTC,"That's called rolling, people who can't afford to splash out on pots 24/7 do it, personally I wait for +15hp or more.  If you know you are going to max to 6/8, just look at hp/mp rolls.  Way above average is really rare though, it's like a white bag, don't actively search for it, just keep it in mind and take the +20hp rolls"
RotMG,3ayan0,Acedin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:17:42 2015 UTC,i have -6hp but +1-3 on all my other stats... would you suggest that i reroll? Im a scrub just trying to farm pots by using sorc xP
RotMG,3ayan0,eatmetoday,3,Wed Jun 24 14:51:59 2015 UTC,"Other stats have way less of an importance compared to HP. HP/Mana are the hardest to max stats, compensating 1-3 ATT/DEX/Wis is really easy."
RotMG,3ayan0,kanonkongenn,2,Wed Jun 24 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"ehhh i wouldnt reroll if you dont want to max though, because any character that you aren't planning to max will die very quickly (i assume), so there's no point getting a mad +30 hp/mp roll if you arent going to max its def etc.  reroll only if you know you CAN max it, like enough def stored up."

RotMG,3av129,0IS,12,Tue Jun 23 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"A while ago the drop rates were released in xml (I think) format on the forums. As far as I know the drop rates haven't changed since then.

Most of the other drop rates probably haven't been adjusted and are likely still accurate."
RotMG,3av129,Wylem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"Well that answers a lot of questions. It's safe to say these haven't been changed since then:  Ogmur is 0.2% (pls, game. pls)  Conflict, Dirk, Oreo 0.1%  Sphinx Jugg is 0.2%  Hermit Jugg is 0.026% per tentacle spawner (but SB is applied based on damage to the Hermit God itself), works out to 0.19% overall  QoT is 0.05% (1 in 2000, that's per Greater Nature Sprite. Roughly 1 in 400 fully buffed Ent Ancients)  And 0.1% for Bulwark if it wasn't changed.  edit: it has Plague at 0.1% and Resu at 0.25%  Mega-rototo had a 5x higher chance of dropping CC. No idea if that's still the case, since the rates have changed."

No wonder I get nothing but cjuices lately. I'm not sure if the drop rates have changed, but I'm pretty sure they didn't mess with thresholds at all, so chances are this is still the case."
RotMG,3av129,ROTMGBootzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"For septavius, it says:  <SoulboundLoot prob="".3"" min=""1"">Potion of Wisdom</SoulboundLoot>   Anyone know what happens when a threshold isn't specified?  Also my guess is the prob is much higher than 30% after the build where they took pots out of godlands and increased dungeon drop rates.  And seriously, thresholds of 45% (and 90% god damnit) just scream anti-coop to me.  Why would they ever do that?"
RotMG,3av129,Wylem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"The devs seemed to think it means a single hit qualifies.  But considering Thessal has no threshold for mana and Tomb bosses have no threshold for life, but both seem to take a lot of damage to qualify on, I'm pretty sure it just defaults to something in the 5-10% range.  We brought this up a couple times in testing IRC (and if I remember right, Skoad did indeed intend for life to be super easy to qualify for), but I don't think we ever pestered them enough to get the engineers to look into it.  I'm not sure about Septavius though. Have you ever gotten a wis without doing 400+ damage? Seems like he'd be the easiest place to test this, of the ones I know about."
RotMG,3av129,ROTMGBootzilla,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"Have you ever gotten a wis without doing 400+ damage?   I feel like I have.  I remember numerous times where I was leveling up on a priest and had something like a t3 wand and still got wis despite the others doing most of the killing.  My memory could be wrong though - if it was a t7 wand instead, racking up 400 damage isn't too hard even unpotted.  Funny that they never figured out what happens when a parameter isn't specified.  I tend to be a perfectionist with some stuff, but I feel like you have to really not care if you don't feel like verifying what something defaults to.  Also having this list handy is nice.  I wish everyone could see it ... the number of times I've seen greedy people do 100% damage on one pentaract tower just makes me cry - it's 10% for a pot and 7.5% for oreo."
RotMG,3av129,Wylem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"I guess that's a side effect of the dev turnover throughout the life of the game (and the complete lack of documentation). We don't know what the older devs thought, and as far as I know the newer ones always specified thresholds.  The pent thing is the worst when someone does that to their own detriment, only ends up hitting 2 towers, and complains when they get 0. We'll have to get this info out there. :p (Sucks that it means the opposite for coral gifts though. What the heck, Willem)"
RotMG,3av129,Mrunibro,2,Wed Jun 24 05:07:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks Wylem! I'll add these in, and maybe so a bit of digging through the xmls myself later."

RotMG,3av129,Davidfight,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Updated. I wasn't sure where to place the shatters UTs, considering the Crown is limited to people who actually complete the whole dungeon."

I have ddone far below 600 Shatter, yet managed to get 6 of them though, so 1% for a whole shatters is a little crazy as well.

I think I've seen that server message once or twice (and that may have been in a severely overcrowded Nexus). I think I saw a lot of complaints about that in the 5 year old Reddit thread that flooded the game with traffic too.  I'm guessing they disabled it for realms/dungeons because it's super annoying to start loading in, then get that error and get kicked back to char select.  (The heart of the problem is that the game can't update realm/dungeon player counts immediately because of connection delays, etc. There's no good fix for it. =/)"
RotMG,3atcyh,Wylem,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"I guess they realized its kind of unfair to give random people load error. It'd be fancy if they mad the realm bigger. Not the cap, the actual map and amount of events in it."

It does kill calling outevents to guild mates and such (including lvl 1 beach robot friend) Maybe have the game check for a certain amount of players when the realm shakes, and if it goes past a certain cap, it will split the players over 2 seperate Oryx Castle (and beyond) Dungeons. But what about WC hosts? And guilds would be separated while they mightve planned to do things togheter. Naw, setting a cap that cant be passed by any way wouldn't be the right way to go."
RotMG,3atcyh,Mrunibro,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"This leaves another option open. A buff to the bosses themselves! As example, take Feargus the Demented ir Pyrr the Wicked. Regardless of group sizes, these will simply take a while, by becoming completely invulnerable until a certain condition is met. For example, let's adapt oryx 1's Artifact phase.To begin the phase,everyone is pushed far back, by having Oryx shoot out a dense cloud of slowly moving, hard-hitting (Pet stasis would help) shots. Aside with tthis some spawners in the room will activate, these spawners will move from wherever oryx is standing(he spawns these spawners) to a certain amount of tiles away from Oryx. These invincible spawners will move to their location inside the bullet cloud, and are immune to debuffs.Once they reach their location these will let out a ssimilar impassable cloud, and at the ssame time Oryx will let loose another dense cloud (so that tricksters and Rogues rogues, and people too far away from the boss to have the shots generated on their screens, will have to retreat or Nexus. Now th boss and its spawners begin shooting out shots that are actually dodgeable , so NOW you can move back in on the boss. Oryx too will be shooting a hellstorm of shots, with his artifacts vulnerable and circling him closely. Once the artifacts are destroyed (These are pretty durable, with VERY high def ajd a good amount of hp. (of course it's going to be hard to get in melee range with oryx letting a hellstorm loose ) and jittery moving artifacts to give ddbow archers a hard time. Oryx is invulnerable until all artifacts (3 of them? I dunno) are destroyed.  Oryx will be invulnerable and say a taunt when these artifacts are destroyed, so tthat people have ttike to move in and deal damage, and prepare for his next phase.

I agree that the shatters can be tougher, but I'm just saying the amount of players disguises Oryx's true talents"

The armor drop would help those who don't have maxed attack stats get their soulbound damage in. I only suggest double/triple health increase because o2 gets melted pretty fast as it is and increasing his health by that much will make the fight last just long enough for those slower people to have a chance.

The enemies are tough, but the boss himself is really easy, even soloing. Make sure you clear the white demons first before you attack though ;)"

Submitted by chedd on Mon, 12/05/2011 - 18:46   As funny as it has been to watch the increasing fervor and rampant speculation about dirk rarity in these forums, I'm becoming worried that some poor soul might actually get tricked into trading away things of great value in exchange for a dirk, so let me officially put a stop to the silliness: no, dirks are not becoming ultra-rare or ultra-valuable.  The root of this rumor seems to be this thread, where many of us (myself included) were joking around. https://web.archive.org/web/20130620030450/https://forums.wildshadow.com/node/15082.

But shouting out someone who is a better representative for the game then you are with your trolling and crap isn't distasteful. Just to you and your groupies because you tweet out hate for someone you have had no co tact with. Sounds like salt to me.

RotMG,3apdhu,act487,2,Mon Jun 22 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"People in my guild don't go around shouting out ""OH YEAH GO SUB TO TECHMECH AND SLVRDLLR."" And we sure as hell don't donate to each other, that would be redundant. Putting a link to another streamer after your comment on a reddit post that is completely unrelated is pathetic. I have nothing against Hetoup as a person, or as a streamer, but his fan club guild confuses me. I understand smaller streamers self-promoting, but someone with almost 5k followers who is constantly trying to get a sub button to get money, shouldn't need to promote himself so widely. When I see people promoting me in Realms or on social media where it seems inappropriate, I tell them to stop, because content creators should build their fanbase legitimately.  Also I do admit my tweets were somewhat out of line, and I didn't mean to diminish his reputation in posting them. I was simply stating something that seemed amusing to me, and sharing it with people who might find it amusing too. If you can't handle a little poking fun, you shouldn't be on the internet."
RotMG,3apdhu,TechmechPlays,-2,Mon Jun 22 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"We don't scream it. But getting a guildie and friend recognition is something that is not pathetic. It is supportive. Yea, it didn't have anything to do with the original thread but has spurred interesting debate. So I don't mind it. I have donated to Het, because I appreciate what he does as a streamer for the game and community. I am in the guild. That isn't redundant. It is being supportive of someone who is representing the game and also who gives back to the community. We aren't a fan club guild. We do actual dungeons and work together in the game as we should. A lot of times without Hetoup. Het is considered a small streamer, 5k followers is nothing in the spectrum of Twitch. I also don't see Het promote himself ever except in the guild Facebook that he is going live. It honestly seems like you assume a lot of what goes on and what happens and don't actually know what goes on. Het has built his own fanbase. Tweeting those things were to to the public and were amusing because it did make it look like you were attempting to start a witch hunt. There is poking fun and there is being salty. There was much salt had in those tweets."

I spoke to Magum about this when he left Night Owls to join your guild, and he said the same thing. He basically said, ""Friends give each other money ヽ(◉◡◔)ﾉ"" Fan =/= friend. I've never had a friend give me money out of the blue because they want to ""support me"" and they ""appreciate what I do."" I don't care though, do what you wanna do, just don't do it in a public place to gain publicity. Your guild is a fan club, solely because its founder has a large reputation.

RotMG,3as976,rdmc11,3,Tue Jun 23 02:31:08 2015 UTC,Its an expensive item it pretty much worth your entire character. You should take it off and sell it to max another char. Since it is worth quite a bit

RotMG,3as976,roreads,3,Tue Jun 23 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"From my point of view, basically it looks like you're managing your wealth really poorly and making a class beginner's misake. The ubhp is very expensive and could basically max another character, and if I may be a little harsh here, it looks like your skill level is still that of a beginner's, so it seems like you won't be able to keep that character alive for long, in fact looking at your realmeye you seem to have already died since you made that post. The thing about equipent tiers in rotmg is that as you go up the tiers, the power of the items goes up linearly whereas the price goes up exponentially, therefore you could be buying cheap equipment with 90% of the power of ubhp but with 10% of the cost. People only begin to wear expensive items like tops and ubhps when they have exhausted all the cheaper options already (and if the don't they're not managing their wealth well). At your stage the wealth would be much better used by selling the ubhp, buying a para hp and then maxing a second character."

RotMG,3as976,kkfenix,2,Tue Jun 23 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"1)expo-great on pally and it will be an easy UT for you to get. Gives you a lot of what you need (def, hp, mp)  2)ring of the pyramid- What i use when i play paladin. Since you're just getting into the game, getting tomb rings the traditional way might be out of the question for a little while. Do you have multiple character slots? If you do then make an 0/8 assasin and pull it out whenever you see a sphinx. Drink loot potions on him and keep him paused inside of tombs until the bosses activate(then bomb them). This is a really selfish/shitty way to get a Pyra but you absolutely will get one. You will be ashamed but your fancy new ring,and the life pots you got along the way, will cheer you up :)  3) para/exa defence-not your first choice, but still solid. A little extra defence is always welcome on a paladin and you're not using a CC so you can definitely put it to use. Swap out for expo or pyra as soon as you can get your hands on one."
RotMG,3as976,yungdroo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"I know that the Expo is a UT from a mad lab correct?  On the other hand, I've never been in a Tomb of The Ancients, or know how to get into one XD. Other than that, I don't have more character slots. Could I use a second account? Will I need to put in DPS on to the Tomb Ancients in order to get a pyra to drop or will it have a chance to drop due to the loot potions?"
RotMG,3as976,Duke_Jopper,3,Tue Jun 23 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"You can't do it on a second account( I mean you can but the ring is not tradable). And you do need to put in damage to qualify for boss loot. I suggested doing tombs on assassin because you only need to land like 4 poisons to qualify for loot(you can do this with little to no risk). Since you don't have a second slot, here is what you should do: Buy a para def ring for one defence potion(don't buy an exa defence ring, those shits are only for archer players with ocd). Use it and go into every mad lab you can find. Make sure to keep an eye out for people yelling ""lab"". The ring can drop from both of the bosses and its not very rare. Its a great ring, you'll like it. And as far as selling your UBHP goes...why? You're figuring out the game still, just self max. UBHP rings are used as a currency, keep it in your vault and sell it when you really need to. And the gear you have on now is great, if you buy a better sword by selling potions you don't need then cool.

RotMG,3as4g7,DaDesk,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I tried using the Sentient Staff as a swap-out for my wizard, but I soon realized it was a poor buy. The amplitude made it too hard to aim and hit enemies, and I sold it off as quick as I could.  Just like you, I was wowed by the +10 wis, thinking I could get a good staff AND mana regen for spell bombs, but in the end, it's not worth it.  You'd be better off using just cwhole, with the usual swap-out of EP. Keep the staff if you want to collect the full ST set, but otherwise, you should try to sell it before the price drops anymore.  Edit: I don't know if the amplitude makes it viable for certain Shatters moments like the Staff of Esben, but I've never had an Esben, so I couldn't compare, but if the amplitude of the staves was similar enough, you could use it in the same situations you would use Esben.

RotMG,3ap1wa,zubatej,0,Tue Jun 23 03:06:08 2015 UTC,What exactly this answer means? When oryx spawned in realms and there was no nexus? When dungeon keys dropped instead of dungeon portals? When bullets were much faster and had much longer range? When you could loot graves of other players? When loot was public and you had to fight for it? When wine cellar portal didn't disappear? When testing was public and you could buy ammies for 500 fame there? When crystal swords were mithril swords? When uts were so rare nobody wear them without an ammy?

I have to admit that the duping made everything cheaper and helped me get my first maxed characters though, I don't think that I would've kept playing for so long otherwise.

RotMG,3ap1wa,jusjerm,4,Mon Jun 22 14:16:15 2015 UTC,"Probably before they put def pots in the abyss. Before maxing def (and acquiring a stockpile to trade others), new players had to work hard in the godlands or try to merch speed/dex and t9 items to scrape their way to maxing. I vividly recall a ten minute fight with malphas when I started playing, or duking it out with septavious in a narrow hallway. Limon was a dangerous boss. Even stethna's pets were dangerous.   The removal of pots from the godlands went terribly, and kabam (ws?) pulled it. Unfortunately; they left def in abyss (and def and att in sprite world). The damage was done. That day, people realized that melees could grind out abyss much better than a robe or leather class could farm the godlands. A realm full of melees meant events got steamrolled. When the holdouts saw what was happening, they too made melee. The response to keep robes safer- healing pets - have created a worse situation. Once pets became monetized, and players young and old grew reliant on them, the game stumbled to what we have today.   You want to relive the glory days? Go npe, stay Thirsty, and be amazed that the challenge is still very much alive.   TL:DR - after the introduction of Tombs and before def was a guaranteed drop"

That was when the game was the most balanced. Permadeath but less gap between beginners and pros because the hp hot keys made it easier for newer players.   Then there was duping, soulbinding and pets. Many classes were no longer viable, ad the gap between new and old players became massive because of pets and soulbound uts."

Keep in mind though, there was duping prior to this - it just wasn't as mainstream. Despite the Great Duping period, ROTMG retained many of its Golden Age experiences afterwards. With that said, I don't want players to think that the game has lost everything. It hasn't. There are aspects of this game from its Golden years that we can all enjoy... that I continue to enjoy. After the Great Duping age came the SoulBound Era where UTs weren't able to be traded. This had some affect to the game, but again, it was adaptable. I would claim that this current time period's greatest tragedy is the Notifier Era. Two of the three tragic time periods came during Kabam's reign. That's why Kabam is looked at so badly... on top of that, their lack of effort in maintaining the game and innovation. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt - they're busy. -_-  All this said, I do believe there can be another golden era if drastic innovations are made. It's possible. How likely? Not sure yet."

What I liked most though is that people actually played the game, regardless of doing it with duped items, they did and it was fun for everyone, aside from some people that were upset that their 'empire' started melting because of the prices, but it was never about that.

All the crazy shit flying around was just too intimidating, and I never really attempted to get to the end.  I built a ton of wealth grinding, traded for tops, but never did Oryx.  Well, I finally fell backwards into a small guild of really awesome people and in the past 2 days I've done 01, 02, and a bunch of Trenches.  It's funny when you realize as a 6/8, you can literally just run through the castle, I was always too afraid of loosing a char.  And while Trench is pretty scary, the boss is quite easy.

I play mainly knights, as I think they're OP as hell and abysses are making me some consistent wealth.   I currently have a 6/8 knight, a 5/8 warrior (cuz wis is useless when you can permabuff), a 4/8 assassin (which I'm still working on) and a 1/8 wiz (also still maxing)   I used to play wizard a lot and still like it because it has great DPS. I've tried out pretty much everything except for rogue/ninja, since imo rogue is rather useless and I don't like the idea of ninja because it has basically melee range w/o the advantage melee classes have (being a tank) .   I have a 90/88/76 heal/mheal/elec pet (not trying to brag, I feel like a pet makes a huge difference to certain classes, e.g. a fulmi sorc with high mheal is waaaaay better than one with low mheal)   Tl;dr: read the first sentence"
RotMG,3an9fu,0IS,2,Sun Jun 21 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"You have a good composition already. Max that wizard, because they're arguably the most well- rounded class.

Let me elaborate; I press W and let go. Instead of my character moving forward a short distance, the character continues to move forward as if I am holding W down. I only stop when I hit a wall or I press S. This, however, results in my W and S keys both being ""locked"". The same issue occurs with all of my WASD keys, my Q and E keys, and the space bar. The issue is not limited to the nexus only. If I am somehow able to make it to one of the realm portals, I get on the beach, then I have the same issue.  This has not happened to me before, and I'm really not sure as to what the issue is. I have recreated this issue in browser and projector (I normally play in projector) and also by playing a random WASD game I found. I checked on Minecraft, however, and that works fine. This is making me think there may be an issue with Flash itself. The issue is not related to sticky keys. I have restarted my laptop multiple times to no avail.

RotMG,3an9fu,jusjerm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"I never understood this myth. Paladin is demonstrably worse than knight and warrior at avoiding damage in abyss. All it can do is recover faster. This doesn't help when shotguns take down inexperienced players. Also, paladin will usually reach third phase of malphas, while warrior and knight can deal enough damage to kill him when he shrinks."
RotMG,3an9fu,I_RIP_too_much,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"The primary reason for paladin being considered the best class in abyss for new players is because with buff he can oneshot all the monsters in abyss. Knight can't do that ever, and warrior can only do it with ancient stone sword, which most new players won't have. It's much better to be a little less tanky/fast and only let the brutes get one shotgun off at you then it is to have a bit of extra def/spd and potentially risk having them shoot multiple times"
RotMG,3an9fu,jusjerm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:15:04 2015 UTC,"I understand, but as soon as they are maxed, the paladin becomes the worst option of the three."
RotMG,3an9fu,I_RIP_too_much,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:53:09 2015 UTC,why would you say that?
RotMG,3an9fu,jusjerm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"Less dps than warrior, less safety than a knight. Warrior can kill demons faster (and evade them). Knight can tank shots with no fear, or stun them before then can cause harm. Paladin has difficulty killing malphas before his third state begins. I'd take knight or warrior for abyss rush before paladin  Outside if abyss, when would you rather have a paladin? We all have pets that heal now. We need to win an arms race, not live the longest. My ppe paladin gets called in only because he is expendable."
RotMG,3an9fu,I_RIP_too_much,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with what you are saying here, but it appears we are talking about two completely different things; you are talking about the three melees in an ideal endgame context like you and me would experience, while I was specifically referring to the OPs situation.   We all have pets that heal now.   Sure WE do, but how about the OP? He says he's only been playing for two weeks, and even if you are very active, you likely won't have a particularly strong pet in that time, maybe not even a maxed uncommon. So while yes, with a maxed rare or legendary pet, the paladin healing can be more insignificant, with a weaker pet for a newer player, the sustain bonus from paladin is actually quite useful.    Warrior can kill demons faster (and evade them)   I am not sure if you are talking about the abyss demons or the white demons here. If you are talking about the abyss demons I completely disagree seeing as paladins will easily one-shot all of them with buff, whereas warrior will only consistently one-shot them with an ancient stone sword, which OP probably doesn't have.  If you are referring to the white demons, I completely agree - Warrior does kill them faster. However, that doesn't really matter very much seeing as the clearing of white demons represents a relatively small portion of the time actually spent in an abyss from start to finish.   Knight can tank shots with no fear   I understand that this isn't meant to be taken literally, but still I feel that you overestimate the difference in tankyness between knight and paladin in abyss. Most of the shots in abyss (other than those from brutes) are already reduced as much as they can be against paladin's 55 defence, so the extra defence from knight isn't always useful. Additionally, the constant +112 hp from paladin, along with the increased healing, is quite helpful for those that can't just tank everything with their pets.   or stun them before then can cause harm   Limited mana = limited stuns. Also, abyss mobs pretty much always get at least one group of shots off before you will be able to stun them.   Paladin has difficulty killing malphas before his third state begins.   In my personal experience in abysses on paladin, I haven't noticed this at all, and I wasn't aware it was an issue. With maxed att/dex and a Dblade I almost never fail to kill the boss before he goes invulnerable. I realize that it probably isn't possible to kill before the third phase as paladin without a Dblade, but is it even possible to do so on the other classes?  Anyways, like I said, I agree with you that warrior/knight are GENERALLY more useful in endgame scenarios with strong pets. However, just because it may be a weaker class for you and me, doesn't mean it is a weaker class for everyone; necromancer is considered to be one of, if not THE worst class in the game, and yet, for brand new players it is certainly one of the best. While the discrepancies in strength at various stages of the game with paladin may not be as significant as those with necro, they still exist, which is why I will stick to my opinion that my initial suggestion of paladin to the OP is correct for his situation."

RotMG,3an9fu,Duke_Jopper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Peek into a room and see what enemies there are. If there are a few brutes (the ones that chase you and shoot short range bullets) then circle them and shoot behind you. If there are the long range enemies then try to stun them and dodge the bullets by moving back and weaving through them then rushing forward again in the intervals. The last of your worries are the ones that shoot a wide set of bullets and move around fast, you can ignore these or kill them last.   Once you get to the boss (will be 32 rooms from the spawn iirc) circle the walkway and kill the white demons. Once you walk in past the walkway you will awake the boss. Malphas is pretty easy just try to deal as much damage as you can with your max dex.   I would also recommend maxing attack because knights ussually roll close to the max. You can get att from manors or from the sprite gods in sprite worlds (the purple ones that you find in rooms on the way to limon) You can also sell this attack for anywhere from 1 to 2 def."

RotMG,3an9fu,Kirikomori,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:43:10 2015 UTC,Basically this. But the situation youd use it in is so rare and the difference it makes is so little that its not worth carrying around wasting an inventory slot. Just use it for pet food!

RotMG,3an9fu,Kirikomori,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"If your rare reptile has the proper max level cap (70) then farm godlands for reptile eggs (godlands is the best source of common and uncommon eggs, hop in a train with a sorcerer and youll get them really quick!) until you hatch a reptile that has the combination of abilities you want. then start maxing that new reptile while using your current one, unti the new reptile is strong enough to use. then in the future you can start thinking of fusion to legendary: if you have a rare pet already then you might as well use it for fusing.  If your rare reptile has a lower cap than 70 then hatch eggs of other families unti you get the ability combo you want. preferably hatch human eggs because it always has heal as the first ability which makes the probability of you getting your desired ability combo much greater, but if you like a different pet sprite. This is because a lower level cap is irreversible and makes your pet weaker/more expensive to feed.  I wouldn't count on getting a rare/legendary egg drop as those are extremely rare, even rarer than 1/100 UTs, they are rare to the point that youre much more likely to max a second rare before you get one.. If you really want one right now, buy it with realm gold."

RotMG,3agd90,OmgItsDennis,5,Sat Jun 20 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"This doesn't remove coop - the game never was exclusively coop to begin with (just look at the rogue class - they are very anti-coop), so this just makes it easier to go solo for those who already wanted to (and often already were).  Plus the game has changed so much that almost no one wants to play cooperatively anymore because there is no longer much benefit to it.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing cooperatively, just not with cheaters who show up when events spawn.  Actually come to think of it this would probably promote coop.  Right now if a new player steps into a dungeon with a ""pro"" player, the pro player will often do whatever they can to deny the new player loot to ensure they get the guaranteed drop (this ranges from dragging to self-buffing to just sitting on a boss to kill it before new players can get damage in).  Now those people will just select ""solo"" and new players will choose ""enter"", which means newer players and people who want to play cooperatively can do the dungeons together without having the greedy people around to ruin the experience. For me, it would fix part of the most broken aspect of the game right now: notifiers.  If I spawned a sphinx in a solo realm, I obviously wanted a solo tomb and shouldn't have that taken away from me by 10+ cheaters.  I just don't do quests to spawn events anymore because there's no point (and it actually means I'm feeding the cheaters).  With this solution, events still get wrecked but at least I can solo my tombs.   Given those two points, maybe there should even be no limit to how many times you can choose ""solo"" in a day.  Overall it's a great idea!  Only potential problem is the ""too much loot?"" question.  Right now a typical tomb will give out something like 3-10 life total.  If people can pick ""solo"", get four people who know how to tomb and that's already 12 life, plus add all the notifiers (who usually don't know how to tomb) who go in the public tomb with asssassins and dbows and you're probably at least doubling the number of life drops in the game.  For Ocean Trench you're probably increasing it by at least tenfold because all the cheaters aren't affected by paralyze so they can solo rush them with no risk.  I'm not sure what the solution to this is though."

RotMG,3agd90,SirbillyRoTMG,4,Sun Jun 21 12:11:31 2015 UTC,"Let's remove the coop from a coop game! Not to sound abrasive, but this really isn't a good idea. It'll only serve to lock out lower level players and promote an even more anti coop experience."
RotMG,3agd90,Demisedulous,2,Fri Jun 19 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"I can see a major downside to this  In a game I played called runescape, they added the ability to do instanced bosses which meant that you could pay say, 100000 coins to do a boss on your own or in a team or whatever. This allowed the boss to be done more times by more people than ever before because beforehand, only 1 boss could be completed per world. This meant that before they implemented this feature relatively few of the more rare drops came in to the game from these bosses as only say 70 could be done at any one time and at a drop rate of something like 1/128 the items were few and far between, maintaining the economy quite well. However as time went on before this update more and more items came into the game from the bosses so they lost high amounts of their original value. When they added the feature to do instanced bosses this made the situation much worse because as well as more of these rare drops coming into the game (devaluing them further) more of the smaller drops were also put into the game at higher rates, meaning the boss became less worthwhile to do and eventually the economy around the items went to shit.   However in runescape this had some kind of pay back. The money sink at the start of the instance sort of allowed the economy to maintain a decent standard due to the amount of money tied to the wealth of these items was being pumped out of the game permanently. This allowed for an interesting solution to the problems of deflation of item worth and general money worth - If theirs less money in the game its going to be worth more.   This would be a good solution to the problems of soloing. If they implemented this as it is it would allow many, many more potential drops than it would otherwise. This would result in more items going into the game devaluing the items that are already in the game to the polint where there is no reason to grind the dungeons any more as the potions you can get from them are worth so little it would be quicker just to run a shatters or something and get t11s to sell them to.  Realm doesn't have a definite currency and the closest we have is def potions. Def potions being a guaranteed reward from a dungeon which can be soloed in theory tens of times from one portal means that these def potions would lose value destroying our reasonably stable game economy. We can see such an effect with the duping of incs, ruining the price of once rare wine cellar tops such as edeto which, before the mass duping outbreak, were worth over 200 def potions, now only worth 20. Another example is that of vit potions, which were worth ~1.5 def before pets allowing more and more abysses to be run. This made the supply much higher than the demand devaluing the potion to the lowest of all potions.   If this were to be implemented there would have to be some kind of entry fee for each player or a weekly deposit which allowed the player to solo dungeons for a week or something, acting as a money sink for our best shot at a currency - our potions.  tl;dr- The idea is good but requires some kind of money sink to work correctly.  Note- there is the argument about realm being perma-death and so these potions will always have value but if there are more potions coming into the game than people dying which is certainly possible with a feature like this then the perma-death aspect wont make any difference (runescape isn't perma death and items are rarely ever sunk)"
RotMG,3agd90,Le_giblit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"Giving Abysses guaranteed def and a ridiculously high portal drop rate already had that effect. I can't imagine this making it much worse for def, though mana and life would tank if those dungeons were soloable.  But economy aside, the option to solo or choose your group would make the game a lot more enjoyable.  I kind of wonder if they shouldn't just let pot rates be high, but make the game 10 times more dangerous. Let it get back to the original design principle of fast progress and very short character lives."

RotMG,3agd90,Stonephone,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:05:16 2015 UTC,+1. This would benefit so much to players who hate leechers. Although you could just go into small/uncrowded server. To me i would want something like this in the game because being a known person on my home server i hate to see these morons leeching dungeons which either i leave or get nothing from what-so-ever.

RotMG,3ai51k,instancesx1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"I am implying that your source is outdated and that I do not hack. I do however admit to using a client for about 3 months between October and December. That is why the video you found shows me reconnecting. I was actually quite surprised when I watched the whole video. It reminded me of how even I was a client user. I reconnected and was immune to de buffs. I had autonexus and auto aim. Those were the golden times. I rarely died and I had amassed a fortune. But something was missing. The game wasn't fun anymore. It was all top easy. All I had to do was press I and move around. No skill was required and I could do almost whatever the hell I wanted.  It's been a long time since then and now I find this game much more enjoyable without a client. I may doe a whole lot more and have a  much smaller fortune, but the gamr is fun. (That is before you lose 4 chars in 1 day) You can ask almost anyone in my guild and they will answer that I do not hack. You have commented on many of my other posts stating that I hack. I find it quite annoying and childish to keep on pointing out the same fact over and over, when I know that I do not hack. If you were wondering how I play now, I play with a  normal flash client at 600x800 res, low quality and maximized so that It takes up my whole screen except my Taskbar which is on the left for me. Buldokan plays the same way, so you can speak to him about it.  I hope you can understand and stop commenting the same thing on all my posts.  Thanks. Hopefully we can end this dumb argument for good."

Always keep 12-18 life as backup for each character, depending on if you like tops or not.  Prioritize sprites, abysses, UDLs."

Yes, but you have to look at it from Kabam's perspective.  UTs untradeable? People are happy, so they buy more gold and Kabam makes more money. But then RWT shops sell their 50000 duped UTs in shops, therefore making Kabam loose a CRAP TON of money.  Reskinned UTs Lots of people are happy, that makes people buy gold and Kabam gets money. There's literally no downside to this.  Don't think ""this is good and this is bad, this is smart and this is dumb"".   Think ""what makes Kabam money?""."

RotMG,3acjvg,epikcosmos,2,Fri Jun 19 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"TL;DR I submitted a ticket suggestion suggesting the samurai class  I submitted a suggestion to create a samurai class last year around this time. In my suggestion I included:  Weapon: Katana  Ability: A party buff that speeds everyone and a self buff that doesn't make him overpowered  Armor: Heavy  Max HP: 720 - Although all heavy armored classes have 770 max hp, the katana gives the samurai a lot more range than swords+ it pierces  Max MP: 252 - like all melee classes  Max Att: 65 - the self buff should suffice for more damage if possible  Max Speed: 50 - heavy armor, thus, slow movement + there's a movement speed party buff (speedy)  Max Vit: 50 - Why not 40? 75? The samurai class is a melee class + that extra range would make it op with a lot of vit and it needs to tank some damage in order to go in.   Max def: 25 - the heavy armor makes it tanky (side note: ninja has way too low def for its kit)  Max Dex: 65 - again, the self buff should suffice for more damage  Max wis: 50 or 75 - depending if the party buff for speedy would increase in range and duration based on wisdom. The higher the better  Overall I think of this class as a support class to help others rush in wc and other dungeons (possibly new ones - I believe in kabam) that do not allow teleportation of players"

No hate toward the video I was  commenting on how much it probably sucked for you to do make it happen.

What's even funnier is the irony in that you express you want someone banned by commiting a bannable offense yourself.

RotMG,3aesf9,RotMGNigga,4,Fri Jun 19 15:28:23 2015 UTC,Here's a crazy idea:  Actually play the game for fame.
RotMG,3aesf9,RotMGNigga,-2,Fri Jun 19 15:28:47 2015 UTC,I just need to level up... that's all.
RotMG,3aesf9,yungdroo,3,Fri Jun 19 15:32:19 2015 UTC,Having a (experienced)friend level you up is twice as fast as a fame train.
RotMG,3aesf9,DDLSavior,4,Fri Jun 19 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"and then that (experienced) friend levels up twenty more of your characters, or however many it takes, for you to get the roll you want?"
RotMG,3aesf9,yungdroo,0,Fri Jun 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I just moved and all of my friends live in Cali and i dont believe that are awake right now."
RotMG,3aesf9,RotMGNigga,-2,Fri Jun 19 15:43:13 2015 UTC,That's bullshit and you know it.
RotMG,3aesf9,yungdroo,5,Fri Jun 19 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"You rite. Starting when a character reaches lvl 11, a fame train in the glands becomes the fastest consistent way to level(if you try to dispute this then you are a liar). To argue that an experienced friend can level you from 1-20 twice as fast as a train can is effectively making this point: By being leveled by an experienced friend, you save enough time from levels 1-11 to make up for the time you will lose from levels 11-20 AND your total time gets cut in half. This makes no sense."
RotMG,3aesf9,DGYYY,2,Fri Jun 19 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's a fact.  Gods level you up very fast when you're at a decent level, but because the Fame Train sucks a LOT in the lower levels since a enemy can only give you like... 1/10 of your total exp needed for that level, meaning that in the beginning levels gods only give you minimal exp, so having a friend level you up is mathematically faster.  Before being so aggressively confident, actually... you know, check it for yourself."
RotMG,3aesf9,paceboys,3,Fri Jun 19 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"Words have meanings... Don't say ""twice"" if you don't really mean ""twice"". Don't say ""fact"" if you don't really mean ""fact"""
RotMG,3aesf9,DDLSavior,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"Having a friend level you up at lower levels is better, leveling up post those lower levels is longer than it would be in train making it all worse alltogether. I always prefer a train, especially when looking for good rolls. Even at lower levels, due to sheer amount of gods that are killed you still level up very fast, regardless of the low XP they give.  Source: I'm sometimes leveled up by my friend that has an 8/8 archer and it's always slower compared to fame train.  Note: I'm counting that it will only take you around a minute to enter a realm, if you wait 10 minutes to enter it then a friend is a better choice."
RotMG,3aesf9,RotMGNigga,-2,Sat Jun 20 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"Meh, it's more reliable at the least. No random medusa 1shots. I don't think it's faster though, assuming you don't die"
