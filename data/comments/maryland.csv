You have to reduce your usage against the same period last year, so if you haven't done it before, you can definitely save yourself a few bucks. After the first year though, it gets harder because your baseline becomes your usage during the savings period this year."
maryland,3e05v5,bigwilliesty1e,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks a lot for clearing it up. I got the call and was confused."
maryland,3e05v5,bigwilliesty1e,8,Mon Jul 20 23:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. No problem. The grid operator forecasts demand on the grid and for days on which it projects we will be approaching peak load, they issue warnings to the utilities which, in turn, initiate their peak demand programs to try to reduce load so we don't, in a worst-case scenario, have a blackout. More practically, it's about reducing stress on the system and price protection. During peak demand days the clearing price for power can multiply to many times more (10-20x) than average for a typical mwH. PJM--our grid operator--has a cutesy little site that talks about electricity prices if you're interested.  There are several slightly different types of programs. Customers can sign up to allow the utility to cycle their A/C 50% or even 100% of the time in exchange for a pre-defined annual credit on their bill. They also do programs like the one you were called about where it is entirely voluntary and you are compensated for the amount of power use you reduced. There are a few others as well."

maryland,3e05v5,Zansurf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:41 2015 UTC,Unless this is different for residential customers it should not matter as they don't base your charges on year over year reduction in demand. Basically during the 5 days of highest demand they take each end users peak demand during those days and calculate a tag that dictates what you will pay the following capacity year (June 1 - May 31st). Technically you won't see your costs go down each year but you will still save money based on what your peak demand would be if you don't curtail your usage.

As far as other benefits/perks, not a whole lot. Pre-arranging time off can be handled but it won't be just given to you. Time off is based on time served. I received a discount for parking in the  state-owned garage, but it was still more money than paying to park at Lexington Market's garage. If you want to use the bus, metro or light rail they do offer a nice discount card. I took the commuter bus everyday for over a year and paid about 1/3 of the regular fare.  It's always worth asking someone at HR once the offer comes in about benefits/perks, but trying to up the salary may not float.  Good luck to you!"

Looking at his Wiki page his campaign has been working hard to sanitize and fluff it.   I still don't get this ""Black Lives Matter"" business anyway.

But the choir always sang back ""Do you drive on the roads, huh? Do ya? DO YOU?""  He did nothing to improve the horrible jails, especially Baltimore City but no one says an unkind work against him there. We're talking about criminals after all, why should liberals care about them?  He and his friends pissed away all the stimulus money to their friends, and Maryland is none the better.

As a student of the HCPSS, they reduced our lunches and raised the prices under Ulman. What about those of us who need more calories, who have a higher metabolic rate? Should those people be punished with higher cost school lunches?   They took the salt off of our french fries under Ulman's command.

It's a nice area with pretty much every convenience you can think of right down the street. This is in Cockeysville, right in between Timonium and Hunt Valley.  There are a whole lot of apartments to choose from here, but I've lived in Briarcliff and Deertree (current). Deertree is nice because they pay for heat and air, and rent is $1005 for a one bedroom townhome. Apartments are a bit cheaper. You just have to pay BGE, which has been between $20-40 a month for me. The only complaint I have is the sound proofing kind of sucks, but otherwise I like it here.   Briarcliff is great and toward the higher end of the spectrum. One bedrooms are $900+ I believe, but they really get you with the utilities. Their apartments are great though because they're very spacious and the sound proofing is excellent. You also get a washer and dryer in the unit. Both places offer Verizon Fios, which was a big deal breaker for me and it's pretty rare.  Feel free to ask any questions.

The administration plans to ask the Board of Public Works Thursday to approve its proposal to cut $3 million from the budget of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services by reducing its human resources staff.  A state employee union leader said Tuesday that it may be a sign of more cuts to come.  ""They're firing people. When you abolish positions, you're firing people,"" said Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3. ""That's what happens when you cut 2 percent of the department's budget across the board.""  A spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan said there's more to the decision than the 2 percent budget cut imposed on all agencies.  ""The department has identified human resources as an area of critical concern that requires urgent attention and is taking steps to restructure and dramatically improve HR within the agency,"" spokesman Matthew A. Clark said.  He said the proposal ""is fundamentally about finding the best possible people to work in an essential state agency charged with ensuring public safety.""  A department spokesman declined to say how many of the positions would be cut through layoffs, but a senior legislator said she expected the number to be in the mid- to high 20s.  House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Maggie McIntosh, who was briefed by Public Safety Secretary Stephen T. Moyer, said she was told that some positions would be reclassified and that their current occupants would be allowed to reapply.  The department said in a statement that it was making the move to ""overhaul and streamline"" its operations and to address ""long-standing issues"" in human resources.""  ""The proposed reorganization will provide for unity of command, centralized direction and authority and uniformity of employee processes,"" the department said.  Officials said the reorganization will consolidate human resources workers who are now scattered among the agency's far-flung facilities into five ""operational hubs.""  They said the current structure — with human resources workers at each facility — creates ""duplication of services, overlap, communication problems, and disincentives to any economies of scale.""  The department has faced questions about both the pace and quality of its hiring. Aides to Hogan pointed to hundreds of vacancies, many of them for frontline corrections officers, that have yet to be filled. The department has been mired in scandal in recent years over corrupt relationships between officers at the Baltimore City Detention Center and prisoners in their charge.  McIntosh, a Baltimore Democrat, said the changes might be justified.  ""Do I see anything here that says this is terrible? No,"" she said.  Still, McIntosh said, she wished the department had brought the cuts to her committee when the General Assembly was in session.  The lawmaker said that she would not be surprised to see more cuts as departments absorb the across-the-board spending cut Hogan proposed in January for the year that began July 1.  ""You will find state employees who are no longer employed,"" she said.  Hogan boasted in January that he had submitted a balanced budget that didn't raise taxes without the need for layoffs or furloughs. But when he announced a buyout program in February, he expressed the hope that it would ""mitigate the need for significant layoffs in the future.""  Moran said the department is already operating at 1970s staffing levels despite a growth in state population.  ""I would not be shocked to see more of these antics from other departments,"" he said.  mdresser@baltsun.com  Copyright © 2015, The Baltimore Sun"

The reason that I suggest going to Union Station is that it is physically larger, and will most likely have a ticketing area for you to use.  Plus, if you go to Greenbelt from Silver Spring, you'll have to change lines."

maryland,3d9suy,bmoreSpiff,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"I just realised that I will be travelling on a Sunday, and that the Camden line is not in service on Sundays. I will thus take the metro to Union station, take the Penn line to Penn Station, and then the metro from there on."

I live on the Eastern Shore, and for the past 50 years countless people have fought tooth and nail to get this road widened. This isn't some pet project that Hogan green-lit just because. People die on this road nearly every month. The average is about 2-3 deaths per month since 1980 with around 100 deaths since then. Most recently 3 people and a dog were killed in a horrible collision with two 18-Wheelers.   The thing is, if 404 were a western shore road, this project would have been completed decades ago. The state has owned the land right of ways since the 50's to do this project, and only now is something (thankfully) being done.  This article is nothing more than sour grapes about the rail lines."

maryland,3d5d23,KeelVerezy,-6,Mon Jul 13 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"Here's a novel idea. Why not reduce the speed limits if so many people die on the road? Reducing the speed limit, setting up speed cameras, and having regular speed traps would also serve to reduce the deaths on the road and cost significantly less than $204M.  The above would be the fiscally responsible thing to do. But I'm sure it's not favored amongst the folks that like to ignore speed limits.  According to this list, it's 100 deaths since the 1950s: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=849493651793780&id=101193066623846 Hardly a problem, statistically speaking. The actual number appears to come out around 0.1366 deaths per month on this roadway. By the way, for anyone that questions the source, these are the folks that keep an official ""memorial garden"" for the roadway.  Route 2 (Ritchie Highway) has significantly more deaths (I need to find the list), and it's fairly wide in a large portion of its stretches.  For that matter, $204M has much better uses in much more population dense areas.  I should go for a drive on this road and see where problems could be. Maybe I'll dashcam the drive and post the video for civil engineers to make suggestions.  For that matter, do we have reasons for the deaths? Alcohol? Speed? Other distractions?  Edit: Downvotes because you disagree with the idea? Reducing speed limits saves lives. This is proven, studied, statistical fact. You can argue against it all you want--but it's proven science.

maryland,3d5d23,a-ko,5,Tue Jul 14 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"Your source is wrong, they even admit right in that post that they're asking people to help them better build the list.

SHA officials report that 36 of those fatalities occurred from 1995 to 2008, an average of 2.57 deaths per year during that time.""  You folks have obviously never travelled this road if you honestly think lowering speeds will do a thing. It's wide open country roadway with head on traffic. The speed limit is already only 50 the entire stretch, which is bogged down to a crawl in several spots with stop lights and bumper to bumper every weekend in the summer, yet these fatalities keep happening.   Your downvotes are because you have no idea what you're talking about, and your stats are wrong.   EDIT: oh and deaths are deaths, but let's not forget the injured in the countless non-fatal accidents as well."
maryland,3d5d23,mdignen,2,Tue Jul 14 07:09:15 2015 UTC,"In what way will widening a road, particularly this stetch of road, decrease accidents and therefore deaths?   I've never driven this stetch of road but turning a country road into an motorway for a brief section seems as if it would just serve to increase speed, increase lane changes/passing, and encourage high way driving in a rural area.   I'm curious and have no clue what this particular stretch of road is about or why its an issue."
maryland,3d5d23,Keedy_Black_AMA,2,Thu Jul 16 11:46:51 2015 UTC,"It's not a brief section, it's about 13 miles. Sure it will allow speeds to increase, but traffic will no longer be opposing each other, there will be 4 total lanes, 2 in each direction separated by a grass median. If you don't see the safety benefits of that, then I don't really know what else to say. The problem currently is that the road is far over capacity for a 2 lane highway with opposing traffic. Some suggest placing a barrier in the middle, but that only solves head on collisions, it doesn't solve the massive traffic congestion and the accidents that occur because of poor access to residences, businesses and side roads.

maryland,3d5d23,Keedy_Black_AMA,6,Thu Jul 16 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"More like ""reducing speed limits saves lives under a very limited set of circumstances -- mainly in urban environments with dense pedestrian traffic.""  In NYC the fatal accidents are almost always where a pedestrian is hit -- improving stopping distance obviously helps with that.  Highway driving is a very different story.  If the fatal accidents are primarily inter-vehicular collisions, it's a very different story.  Reducing speed limits well below what is obviously ""safe"" for a given stretch of highway leads to a more dangerous situation because you have a wider disparity of speeds.  Research shows that in highway driving, the most dangerous drivers are those who don't match the average speed of traffic.  Doesn't matter whether they are driving too fast or too slow.  In fact, you're many times more likely to get in an accident going 30mph BELOW traffic than going 30mph ABOVE traffic.  There's a good video about this here."

maryland,3d5d23,subterraniac,5,Mon Jul 13 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"I drive 404 a lot and I'm not sure widening it is the best idea. Adding a serious median like with 90 into Ocean City and having good merging areas, yes definitely.  I'm not sure it needs to be made into 4 lanes though. 4 lanes is going to induce demand"
maryland,3d5d23,hideisalive,0,Tue Jul 14 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"A median will do nothing to stop the numerous accidents caused when people are turning off the highway. If you travel 404 as often as you say, you should know how incredibly busy this roadway is. The only reason rt 90 works is because there's no turns. It's just straight into ocean city. 404 has dozens of intersections, and that's where many of the fatalities occur."
maryland,3d5d23,mdignen,3,Tue Jul 14 07:12:17 2015 UTC,"Would 4 lanes throughout improve this situation any more than just having better intersections with better turn lanes and longer on ramps?  Right now the turn lanes and off ramps SUCK. I'm aware of that. But they can be fixed.  This is some Jesus-Take-The-Wheel shit: http://imgur.com/G4w1G0y  But adding lanes is going to add more traffic. This is a proven fact of road development.   Then it's going to be even more dangerous because most of 404 doesnt have redlights.  Fix the ramps, add a median."
maryland,3d5d23,hideisalive,0,Tue Jul 14 07:48:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand anything about 404. There's dozens of intersections, and countless residential homes and commercial businesses that have direct access to 404. Slapping in a median will do nothing but cause chaos. Route 90 is an expressway, there's only a couple intersections but otherwise it's an uninterrupted highway directly into ocean city.   Here's an album of just the major intersections on 404 from Rt. 50 to Delaware.   http://imgur.com/a/CwL1E  Again, these are just the major intersections. Hop on google maps and look at the infinite driveways and businesses that have access off 404. The only solution is dualization/widening. This isn't an expressway, this a working highway bordered by numerous farms, homes and businesses. I really wish folks would do their due diligence before coming to conclusions.   You also mention how 4 lanes will bring more traffic. Yeah, that's probably right. It will be a hell of a lot safer though."

I don't understand what due dilligence I haven't done. I drive this road and I provided and example of a bad intersection which I suspect you didn't click on given you're implying I don't know what 404 is enough to know about the types of small intersections. The linked intersection is a very small let very dangerous one.  Edit: I just reread and realized you're attacting my credibility so maybe it wasn't so civil..."
maryland,3d5d23,hideisalive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:03:49 2015 UTC,"I did. The intersections, and head on nature of the highway are the safety problem. When traffic is thinned out and heading in the same direction (which dualization will accomplish) It's inherently safer. Do you understand that a huge barrier in the middle of the road will also required widening since it will eat up much of the roadway? Not to mention that sticking a barrier in the middle just won't work with the intersections, and numerous residential and commercial entries along the roadway.   Edit: Yes, I clicked on your link, and I provided you an additional link with many more of those intersections. Apologies if my response seemed to attack you, it's not my intention. I'm just passionate about this roadway, and I want to see something done to make it safer which thankfully is happening now."
maryland,3d5d23,mdignen,3,Tue Jul 14 10:11:00 2015 UTC,A barrier would require widening but would not require 4 lanes. And yes a barrier would be quite effective in preventing head on collisions.   You don't think if they make this 4 lanes it won't have some sort of median or barrier?  The current 4 lane sections of 404 already have medians.  The improved intersections would handle intersection safety. Please click my link and see how terrible the on ramp and turn are.  Again you're not addressing the issue that induced traffic due to expanding to 4 lanes would have on safety on a road that largely does not use redlights.
maryland,3d5d23,hideisalive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:13:48 2015 UTC,"4 lanes might attract more traffic, it might not. Rt. 50 on the Shore is 4 lanes and you don't have nearly as many accidents. What you're ignoring is the traffic problem that having only one lane in each direction causes. You say you frequent 404, so you should know full well how congested that highway is in the summer months. This congestions will be greatly thinned out when 404 is expanded to 4 lanes, and head on style collisions will all but be eliminated. I know there will probably be barriers installed in the medians, but the main problem is the amount of cars on a road that is head on, as well as numerous dangerous intersections and private and commercial driveways. Barriers in the middle of the highway would required constant turnarounds to allow for folks to get into driveways and businesses, and can you imagine how difficult that would be in the summer months?"
maryland,3d5d23,mdignen,2,Tue Jul 14 10:25:29 2015 UTC,"People already have to turn around on the 4 lane sections of 404. There are medians. What leads you to believe this will be different? What leads you to believe a 4 lane road with a high speed limit and no barrier is safe, and further more that pulling all the way across one is safe?  This is why I stopped posting on here and /r/baltimore   I try to engage in some debate and I get some random person that immediately insults me and refuses to address what I'm actually saying."
maryland,3d5d23,hideisalive,4,Tue Jul 14 10:31:06 2015 UTC,"""For the cost of widening 404, the state could install some 2,000 of the flashing crosswalk lights known as hawk beacons. They would undoubtedly have saved a good number of the 630 pedestrian lives lost on Maryland highways between 2009 and 2014. "" Seriously?  I drive past STOOPID people crossing in traffic 100ft from crosswalks where they can push a button and get 4 way red to cross on.  Several were put in after several fatalities of pedestrians doing smart things like crossing halfway, then walking down the center line till they were ready to ""run for it""... in the dark while wearing dark clothing.  Now, they don't use the new crosswalks or cross at the lights which were put in primarily for the same purpose.  Sometimes ""street-crossing Darwinism"" is ok."

I doubt most of those 630 pedestrian deaths were in crosswalks.  Note that I'm all for the RRFBs at dangerous crosswalks; there are some near my home.  But the last few that I've heard about nearby were in College Park, and happened to drunk people (not even mostly students) after the bars closed at 2am, and they stumbled across Rt. 1 in the dark, not in a crosswalk, not where there's a light."

I was down voted in baltimore for stating cited facts.  you had a civil discussion on this post with someone else, which is way more than what I got from the same one in /r/baltimore  Edit: in 2000, a 25 mile stretch of 404(2 lane country road), received 12000 cars per day. A 40 mile stretch of US301 ( 4 lane split highway)on the eastern shore handled 13000 cars a day. Now this is from 15 years ago and I can't find any newer source with as much info as this one, but to say that 4 lanes aren't needed is just not true. If the traffic demand on us 301 warranted its expansion years ago, why wouldn't the same traffic volume on 404 dictate the need for an expansion?   http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-10-10/news/0010100087_1_caroline-county-eastern-shore-state-highway  I was down voted for stating that"

Most of the other projects are at least 20K cars per day per lane.  The ICC is considered by many to be a complete failure at less than 20K per lane per day.  To put it in perspective, single lanes in Baltimore are used by more than 200K per day."

Depending on time of year. 20,000 cars a day on a 2 lane road with approach speeds in excess of 120mph and uncontrolled intersections seem pretty congested to me. That's 833 cars passing each other an hour on a road that's filled with vacationers who aren't normally used to it. 404's inflated volume in the summer is from beach traffic so I still don't understand how some people can say this is Hogan pleasing the locals when it's more than likely people from across the bridge using the road.  I don't think you can compare a metropolitan city street to a rural high speed road on these aspects. They are 2 completely different layouts designed for different tasks."
maryland,3d5d23,HugoSTIGLITZ216,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"20K sounds a lot better, but as you pointed out it's beach traffic (and Delaware bound traffic at that).  I could understand this project if a lot more had been funded (both infrastructure projects and state departments), but funding these while cutting funding to schools and laying off workers all over the state seems wrong.  I compared the recent fight for fixing a single lane ramp in Baltimore up 65 foot off the water that is 55mph and takes 240K cars a day, every day."

I think what really bothers me is that I clicked on another article linked on that page, and nearly the same comment was made in that article. If you are pointing it out in a news article, then you think it is an important detail. The insinuation is that Hogans whiteness has some bearing on his decision making, and that Brown would not have made the same decision because he is black.   I don't know Hogan personally, so maybe he is a racist. I certainly hope not. If the writer thinks thats the case, they ought to just call him out on it instead of race-baiting."

Maybe I'm just not as cynical as you guys, but to me it just seemed like it was adding context. That part of the article is about the perception of the two candidates in Baltimore, which is a predominately black city. Given that, along with the fact that Hogan is white and a Republican, it isn't a stretch to assume that Hogan has to work harder to be perceived positively in the city than Brown would have.  It probably wasn't necessary to add their races (we all know Hogan is white and Brown is black), but I wouldn't call it race-baiting.  And I'm still wondering why I'm being downvoted?

maryland,3d4b6w,danthemuffinman,2,Mon Jul 13 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"But Hogan risks losing ground in Baltimore because of two actions that he says reflect his focus on fiscal restraint: his rejection last month of the Red Line light-rail project — even as he approved a similarly expensive project in the Washington suburbs — and his decision in May to withhold $68 million in aid for high-cost school districts, including $11 million for Baltimore.    Just because a certain group of the voting population wants something doesn't meet it would be best for them, let alone the whole state.  Governors don't shouldn't exist to serve certain parts of their jurisdictions; they're elected to serve their entire jurisdiction.  I think Hogan is a doing a decent job of doing what's best for the state on at least a fiscal level (considering what O'Malley did to the state's finances during his tenure). During his campaign, he sounded like he really did not want the Purple Line to happen. Yet, less than a month ago, we saw him put aside his own personal biases and decide to green-light the project.   Yes, it certainly appears that he isn't doing everything Baltimore City wants him to do. However, just because Baltimore City wants things, doesn't mean they're good ideas.  Also, there are people (particularly at my school) who are biased against Hogan simply because he's not a Democrat and therefore not doing every single thing they wanted the new MD governor to do. I'd imagine that Baltimore residents and leaders have a similar bias."
maryland,3d4b6w,ThatJHGuy,-13,Wed Jul 15 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"There is a candidate for congress named Alvin Thornton. He's trying to get funding for schools passed that Hogan, for whatever reason, doesn't want to let happen. He'll fund those juvenile detention centers though. Hogan should go somewhere and tend to his health."
maryland,3d4b6w,ThatAgnosticGuy,15,Mon Jul 13 12:49:40 2015 UTC,"What does the juvenile detention center have to do with school funding? The youth jail was a capital expense (long term bond) to address a problem with youth being jailed with adults. The school funding was a part of the operational budget (year-to-year spending), and to get more specific, it was part of a formula to get more money to school systems where it costs more per student.  I definitely was not a fan of the governor cutting GCEI (the formula to which I was referring), but you're comparing apples to oranges."
maryland,3d4b6w,Samuel_L_Jewson,-5,Mon Jul 13 13:15:47 2015 UTC,It's the trend with legislation priorities. State approves 30 million for the center then Hogan goes onto hold 68 million from money set aside for funding schools. Money needs to stop being funneled into Baltimore's incarceration system at such a disproportional rate when education reform is much more necessary if any progress is to be made.
maryland,3d4b6w,ThatAgnosticGuy,9,Mon Jul 13 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that this has very little to do with legislative priorities. Not only are those two things funded from completely different and mostly unrelated pots of money, but the new youth jail is actually to improve conditions for arrested minors in Baltimore.   Currently, minors (I believe mostly ones charges as adults) are often housed with adult criminals, which can lead to the child being abused or neglected. This new facility is so more minors can be held separately and have better access to things like schooling that may be thought of as secondary in adult jails.  The issue of youths being jailed in Baltimore is another discussion entirely. Given the current state of things, I would go so far as to say that adding this new facility is likely a good thing.  Like I said before, I did not like that Governor Hogan decided to not fully fund GCEI, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the youth jail in Baltimore."
maryland,3d4b6w,Samuel_L_Jewson,0,Mon Jul 13 14:10:51 2015 UTC,My point is that Hogan is nothing good for Baltimore because he reinforces the tradition of the city spending loads more on incarceration than public schooling. I don't see how this is not a matter of legislative priority if he has the power to make decisions in both areas.
maryland,3d4b6w,ThatAgnosticGuy,2,Mon Jul 13 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"You can certainly argue that Hogan has Baltimore pretty low on his list of priorities, but my point is that the youth jail has nothing to do with that.  In Maryland, there are two budgets: the Operating Budget and the Capital Budget.  The Operating Budget is what most people refer to when they talk about the budget as a whole. This is where revenue (taxes) and yearly costs (like education, transportation, social programs, etc) come into play. When Hogan talks about being fiscally responsible, he is generally talking about the Operating Budget. The money he chose to not put into GCEI would have been a part of the Operating Budget.  The Capital Budget is for longer term projects that serve a public good, like building schools, roads, or in this case a new youth detention center. This money is borrowed using long-term bonds and payed back over a long amount of time (I believe MD's bond length is actually fairly short at 15 years) with interest.  The point is that education funding and this youth jail come from two completely separate pots of money and aren't at all related to each other. If the governor had, say, put money in the budget for the purpose of hiring more detention officers when people are calling for that money to be spent on schools, you could compare those two. You really can't straight up compare an item from the Operating Budget with an item from the Capital Budget.  I get your point, and there are things you can mention to that make that point, but the youth jail is not one of those things."

In fact, North Carolina is home to three out of the top 10 most-gerrymandered districts in the country. Maryland is proof that gerrymandering isn't just a Republican pastime, as the state's Democrats redrew those boundaries in 2012. The standout in that state is the 3rd Congressional district, which is the nation's second-most gerrymandered and home to Democratic congressman John Sarbanes.  Edit: I'm a nincompoop"

There were clover leaf on/off ramps to 495 at University Blvd (except for one ramp) and they took them all out and now you have to off ramp into traffic lights to turn left instead just merging in from a clover leaf!  They've done this in many areas now.  I figure it's all for the construction unions (campaign/political promises for votes I suppose), and so Maryland can waste more money we don't have.. and then raise taxes.  I have no doubt in several years some MD politician will say we have to put clover leaf on/off ramps back in again... and of course they'll need more money to do that.    The roads here are so messed up, and far too many people cruise leisurely in the left passing lanes, causing rolling roadblocks.  Whenever I have driven to NY and back, I have always succeeded in passing everyone in the right lanes, which is not how the rules of traffic should apply, but that's how it works in MD all the time... butt ass backwards."

Reasons why include collisions between entering and exiting traffic in the short merging lanes, slower traffic flow on the main highway during times of high volume.  Maryland SHA has reconfigure several clover leaf interchange along the Capital Beltway into diamond interchange to reduce collisions and increase traffic flow.  One of the newest interchange on Capital Beltway, Richie Marlboro Road, is a diamond interchange with roundabout."

I guess I just don't understand how people can't seem to understand how to use a clover leaf properly, but I probably shouldn't be at all surprised, seeing as nobody in this state seems to know how to use a passing lane properly either.  Living in this state for so long, I have had to adapt to the other drivers that don't know these things, but it still amazes me that these concepts were never learned or understood by Maryland drivers."

They also feel less comfortable driving around the tight radius loop ramps at or above recommended posted yellow sign speed limit. they also fear spinning out, never mind that under most conditions spinning out is not likely. Highway engineers are removing this fear by removing the loop ramps. The straight ramps in a diamond allow more distance for acceleration before merging.  I use the ramp from MD-295 south to MD I-695 east daily. 8 time out 10 times, the car in front of me will drive around the loop well below the recommended posted speed limit. If there is no one in front of me I leave these timed folks in the dust and and merge at speed well before I run out merge lane. I do this in an under 2L rice burned sedan."
maryland,3cujjt,SandBoxJohn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"The diamond makes far more sense with the roundabouts for those that need to go left (as opposed to hitting a traffic light to turn left), or for those who got off the wrong exit and want to get back on easily.  I just think off-ramping straight into a traffic light makes no sense at all.  And with what they did at university blvd and 495, there's no easy way at all to get back onto 495, or go the opposite direction on University Blvd if you made a mistake.  This is what I mean when I say that there was no improvement, and the road/ramps were made worse with what they did.  You gave an example of an improvement... but we didn't get the full deal here at all.  Here's what they did when they took out the clover leafs."

However, since the system is as rigged as it is towards a party system, it makes zero sense that a group of people coming together to find the candidate that best suits their ideals would want people who don't fit their ideals at all voting for them.  I mean, all we'd have then is people voting for the worst possible candidate for the parties they don't like and the best for the ones they do, which would probably mean we'd have the worst possible candidates winning (which might not be far off from what we have now anyways, but still.)  Sure, there's nothing to stop some people from declaring themselves as the party they don't like to see if they can get that party to put forth it's weakest member, but it is better than allowing EVERYONE to vote for every party's primaries.

I guess they're scared of people trying to sabotage their party by voting for the weaker candidate in a primary.  So I guess the best way to try to change that is to appeal to the central committees to try and get them to at least consider allowing independents to vote in primaries.

I'm going to take step back for a moment and assume you meant ""what's to stop them from registering as a Democract when they vote Republican?"" Usually, people who vote in primaries actually want to influence who their party nominates. If they vote as a Democrat in the primaries, they don't get to choose a Republican candidate.           Now how is that different in an open primary where people can still only vote in one party?         Let's say that in the Democrat party there is one candidate with an overwhelming lead.

People wouldn't be able to wait for the final estimates to decide to risk it and screw the other party.          and after being denied voting in a primary despite being a registered independent voter, I will assuredly vote in my interests - especially given the one-party nature of Maryland and Baltimore politics.            Closed primaries actually help prevent one party systems. The more open primaries are the strong influence a single party has. Blanket primaries, for example, are the most open form of primary voting. They only post the top candidates (not majority vote) accross all parties on the ballet. This means a Democrat will run against a Democrat in the election instead of candidates from different parties. In open primaries, at least one candidate from each large party is put on the ballet. However, open primaries increase the risk of vote manipulation with people trying to screw over the other party.        If you want to increase party diversity, then we need make it easier for third parties to get exposure and be apart of major debates."
maryland,3crasv,Samuel_L_Jewson,2,Fri Jul 10 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does seem a little silly given that people can just change party registration. It's just one more barrier to prevent people trying to play ""spoiler.""   Personally, I think disenfranchising all independent voters isn't worth adding one more pretty insignificant barrier to prevent non party members from deciding a primary, but I can understand their perspective enough to get why neither party has changed it."

maryland,3crasv,ArtGoftheHunt,2,Fri Jul 10 13:45:37 2015 UTC,"It's not really specific to Maryland. People generally don't want to do things that work against their agenda. The agenda of the Democratic and Republican Central Committees is to improve support of the party - unaffiliated voters won't serve the interests of either party, so they don't have a real incentive to include them.  It's just a consequence of the central committees having to make that decision. If it were decided by a third party without a vested interest, it probably would be more fair to at least allow unaffiliated voters to choose one primary in which to vote, but it isn't. Instead, the decision on whether to have an open primary is made by a group that has a vested interest in keeping things the way they are."

On the other hand, the place to preserve them is not at the statehouse. It's not at city halls, or as giant monuments on the side of the road. Perseveration of history does not equal veneration of arguably the most Un-American event in our countries history.  These things belong in museums so they can be viewed in the context of history, and not through a modern lens.   IMO, any celebration of the civil war, and those who fought for the confederacy is 100% wrong, as they were fighting to preserve an institution that was morally incorrect, but that doesn't eliminate the fact that the war happened, and all these pieces of history do have their place in today's world, it's just not as a giant statue at a government building."

It's not something I really identify with in any way, and I've yet to hear a convincing argument as to why it's okay glorify the motives for the war, the people who fought for the Confederacy, or their ideas.  If people want to adorn their homes with the flag, I'm 1000% okay with that.

But all this other anti-civilwar crap is ridiculous. It was a horrible war fought on the core of money, federalism, and humans as property. That doesn't change the fact that the people that died or served in the war were no less American than you or me. Many southern soldiers were not disarmed after the war for that reason, reconciliation. Many of our monuments are in that same spirit.

It wasn't so much a civil war as it was a populist movement that, by the time anyone opposed it openly, had grown too big to stop until all-out war broke out.  America has had many iterations where we interpret and then re-interpret the intentions of our founding fathers, so to say their interpretation makes them un-american is a bit misplaced. Segregation, Interracial Marriage, Same-Sex Marriage, etc. Opposing one or all of these doesn't make you un-american; if anything it makes you more of an American (and a bigot, and an asshat but I digress) because you are using your constitutional rights to defend a position you value.  You could argue though that the south's decision to secede from the US make's them un-american, but then again you could also argue that the north forcing federalist ideals onto another state is also unamerican.  Think of it this way, if the South had one and slavery remained for another 100 years and then eventually was abolished would we still consider them unamerican?"

There's nothing wrong with that being a top priority, but being a single-issue voter, regardless of the issue, can lead to being under-informed and voting for a candidate that has an otherwise bad agenda.  I'm not saying this will happen, but it's possible that, if a lot of voters in an area are single-issue voters, it could attract a candidate that is just trying to game the system to benefit his or herself or friends.  edit: I guess it makes sense to mostly worry about something like guns in a state like MD where it is still a pretty contentious issue across party lines, but I still think voters should consider all of the issues before backing a candidate. Just make it a top priority instead of the only priority."

I abstained from voting for Andy Harris because the only thing I like about him is guns and I didn't want any part in him being elected, but I also didn't want any part in voting for someone who opposed gun rights. And if this next presidential election comes down to Jim Webb and Donald Trump by some miracle, my vote is 100% for Jim Webb (a pro-gun Democrat).  Single issue voters are very heavily involved in the political process. We have to be because we care deeply about an issue. While we definitely prioritize that issue while voting, with that comes a general interest in politics that leads us to take a hard look at the real stances of the people we're voting for even if the stance isn't regarding that all-important issue. If a single issue voter votes for someone who routinely drowns puppies for fun, it's because they made the conscious decision that a vote for the issue they care about is more important than the crazy shit that a politician does in his/her free time. It's not about being uninformed, it's about prioritization.  I'd probably vote against the puppy drowner though"

Financial regulation: stop lending money to people who can't pay it back. Stop lending money and providing huge tax breaks to companies without getting a commensurate benefit in return.

I agree with transgender rights, but they're also a huge minority of cases, so not only am I not affected, the legislation affecting them isn't a dealbreaker for me one way or the other so long as the politician isn't an outright asshole about it.  Also, you misunderstand, we're talking Maryland specific issues. I'm definitely not an uneducated voter, just in Maryland I could give zero craps about most issues that people would choose as something to run on.

It gives children, teens, and adults a place on the premesis to safely play and makes the area look attractive with landscaping, trees, etc. Developers hate it because it cuts into the amount of profit they can make per acre. Most developers get around this rule by donating some tiny amount to the state <$10k in exchange for a variance. The state then used the money to plant trees somewhere else in the state, but as we all know, the state isn't very efficient with getting much in return for their money, not to mention the residents of the apartments or town homes lose out in the long run because the kids have no where to play and in places like the city where this is the rule rather than the exception, there is nowhere nearby for the kids to go play either. This in turn causes crime as kids get bored and do dumb stuff.  I am dealing with this problem with a development going in next door. 8 acres and the developer won't even put a single playground in because it is one less town home they can sell. I can guarantee those kids will wind up playing in the street in front of my house as a result because it gets less traffic.

I would love to see a lottery system with equal opportunity for all applicants, whether large businesses or small mom and pop shops. The license holders will make a fortune, so politicians designating all of that money to big business and not giving the little guys a shot is my worst fear.

maryland,3cf7c9,animeguru,2,Tue Jul 7 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that they overbilled accounts and took more federal money than what was really required by the accounts.  And the Federal government found out and wants their money back.  The problem, auditors found, is that the state paid 776,771 claims for people rated less than the most needy.  So now 3/4 of a million people are going to get bills from either the State or the Federal government.  Because you know that MD isn't going to foot the bill even though they made the mistake.  The Federal government will probably charge interest too.  So these people will end up owing more than what they were paid out wrongly for.  The state is scrambling to argue their point, a disagreement on wording in the law.  Because if they fail to prove that the 34 million was spent properly, they will owe the money back to the Federal government.  If MD does try to bill customers that were granted these services wrongly, I can see a huge class action lawsuit representing the 3/4 of a million people who end up owing money.  This is something that the federal government will either forgive, or it will turn into a giant shitshow with mentally ill people owing money and ending up having to be part of this lawsuit where the lawyer firm will most likely rake in millions in profit from the State while the plaintiffs just break even.  And then that money from the state has to come somewhere.  It would most likely turn a 34 million dollar bill into a 50 million dollar bill after the lawyers on each end get paid."

maryland,3bv7xp,rejectionist,4,Thu Jul 2 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I was rounding up a bit. $40, not counting tax withholding, is about 14 gals of gas at the state average pump price."
maryland,3bv7xp,aresef,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:17:26 2015 UTC,I cant tell if you really think its influential or not.
maryland,3bv7xp,cant_be_pun_seen,6,Thu Jul 2 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"Is it a lot? No. Is it a living wage? Absolutely not, and we need that in Maryland and nationally. But don't discount the impact for whole bunch of people who suddenly have a little more money in their pocket. And raising the minimum wage, besides being the moral choice, is an economic no-brained as well. People who make minimum wage don't necessarily have the luxury of being able to save a lot. More of their paycheck goes out the door to rent, gas, groceries, school supplies. Raising the minimum wage has a ripple effect in economic activity."
maryland,3bv7xp,aresef,3,Thu Jul 2 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure we agree on this, I was just saying that $7/week after taxes wont really effect much. Its more or less political grandstanding for ""raising the minimum wage"" or ""helping the poor.""  While it is great that they are receiving some help, more needs to be done. Because meanwhile, the 1% just quite literally wiped their ass with $7 and in the time it took to do so - made the yearly salary of someone making minimum wage."

Increasing the minimum wage would force them out of work because employers will figure out how to get by without them...."
maryland,3bv7xp,gordonator,0,Fri Jul 3 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"Well, McDonald's specifically is raising their wages unprompted for owned and operated restaurants. But as for the rest of your argument, history tells us that labor market disruption is far outweighed by the economic good a minimum wage hike would do. For teens, specifically, an Economic Policy Institute study from 15 years ago found that a 10 percent minimum wage hike would reduce teen employment by just 1 to 3 percent.  I mean, when I was a teen working at Giant, I got paid a good few bucks above minimum wage as a cashier, with union-bargained raises and stuff. But that's a different beast."
maryland,3bv7xp,aresef,0,Fri Jul 3 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"I work at one of the busiest Pizza Huts in Maryland.  Know how many high schoolers we have on our staff?  Zero.  Know how many college students?  Three.  Know how many people we have staffed altogether?    Twenty to twenty-five.  The minimum wage isn't even mostly paid to high school kids.  It's mostly to adults.

maryland,3bv7xp,Sacamato,6,Fri Jul 3 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, which is why I know that those small businesses will have to raise prices by 0.6% to maintain that margin. Oh, the horror.  And I never said it should be a career wage. Even as a ""starter wage"", if the minimum wage had tracked inflation since 1968 (a year I've cherry picked to your benefit), it would be 10.52 now. Maryland's putting it at 10.10 in 2018.  So, Chicken Little, perhaps you'd like to rethink your position on the sky falling."
maryland,3bv7xp,Sacamato,2,Thu Jul 2 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"If small business owners can't cut it, they'll fail and small business owners who can handle this exorbitant wage hike will take their place."

maryland,3boogo,PhonyUsername,10,Wed Jul 1 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"Not just Maryland. All over the country, courts favor unfit mothers over more stable fathers because I guess the default situation is child-with-mother. Problem is, how could we legislate to make it fair? At some point, judgement calls need to be made, but errors in judgement like this case lead to tragedy. Are medical histories taken into consideration when deciding custody? Although, this wouldn't prevent undiagnosed mental issues. It's heartbreaking what happened to that little boy, but maybe some people will finally take a serious look at child custody practices."
maryland,3boogo,BatCountry9,4,Wed Jul 1 04:25:06 2015 UTC,Judgement calls aren't being made usually. Most judges don't want to make tough decisions so they default to the mother. Custody and domestic violence cases are both the same way.

But when there is little agreement, every little thing needs to be litigated.  and that can get very expensive.  Whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant is of little consequence.      I'm glad to hear that you are amiable with each other.  I hope that lasts.  It often starts off ok and then ends quickly  I can recommend David Bach in Rockville.  He did mine.  He is very reserved, mild-mannered, and matched my personality well.    http://www.bachfamilylaw.com/  I'm happy to answer more questions so DM me if you like."

maryland,3bn2co,Talltimore,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Are you the plaintiff or defendant?  If you're the one bringing suit (i.e. you're the person moving the divorce forward and actively trying to separate from the other person) you're going to be the person spending most of the money on the divorce.  You'll pay as much as you make demands of your lawyer.  Every time you ask your lawyer to do anything, you'll pay.  I would recommend not cheaping out here, as ultimately the difference will be negligible in price, but great in service.  If you're the defendant, you'll pay only when the plaintiff asks their lawyer to ask your lawyer to do something.  Ultimately, you can't control this as much, so this is where it would be important for you to find someone who charges less.  Finally, if there is any amicability in the relationship left at all you might consider working with someone who does divorce mediation.  You can hash out all the splitting up of properties there, and then both hire lawyers just to file the divorce motions and everything at the end, ultimately cheapest for everyone involved."
maryland,3bn2co,Talltimore,2,Tue Jun 30 16:05:46 2015 UTC,Yes that is what I want to do is hire lawyers just to file the divorce motions.  A divorce mediator is perfect.  Any recommendations? Because yes we are amicable with each other.

maryland,3bn2co,thepulloutmethod,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that when I went through my divorce, we used the same lawyer and split the cost.  We didn't argue over much.  But it still needed to go through a court and all.  She filed in another state though.  All state laws are different.  I had to be officially notified by a state trooper or waive that right, I waived it.    And I write contracts for a living, so I edited a bunch of what the lawyer wrote because it was too open ended for my liking on the divorce decree.  Make sure you read that decree over very closely before you sign.  And if you want a word changed, get it changed.  I was surprised with how open ended some statements were.  I wanted to be protected against future events."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

maryland,3b3ro8,narcedmonkey,0,Sun Jun 28 11:57:52 2015 UTC,"I guess the goods that you buy in stores and online are delivered via some magical transit solution then?  Transit only benefits those directly surrounding the stops.  And keep in mind that not everybody wants to live in a city - the expansion of the suburbs that you call ""sprawl"" is proof of that.  I have no problem with government funding transit, provided that it's the same model we follow with roads: government pays for the installation and upkeep of the tracks, the users of the transit pay for the trains and fuel (or electricity.)  But right now you have a situation where everybody is majorly subsidizing all of the costs of transit with only a small portion coming from fares.  That needs to change.  And don't call greenfield housing ""subsidized"" - failing to place massive taxes on something is not a subsidy.  Taking tax dollars from everyone and using them to build transit that 99% of them will never use IS a subsidy, and one that many people are quite reasonably opposed to.  Plus, I didn't see anything about funding new roads, just improving existing ones (including crumbling infrastructure like bridges.)"
maryland,3b3ro8,subterraniac,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:12:50 2015 UTC,Roads are overwhelmingly paid for by general funds not user generated taxes and fees. $800 million of the $2 billion Hogan announced is for new road construction. You couldn't be more off base with your analysis.
maryland,3b3ro8,bmore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what is meant by ""new roads"".  New road means you take a place where there was no road before, and you build a new road.  I didn't see any indication of that happening.  The last major new road built by the state was the ICC.  What I do see is a lot of top county road fixes and enhancements being funded, which will reduce traffic, which in turn reduces carbon emissions and time wasted sitting in traffic.  None of the people who will be helped by that will be helped by any planned mass transit."

Maybe you think Maryland democrats should go ahead and give up democrat controlled house seats out of the kindness of their hearts, and a will to do what's right, but other states won't see it that way..

Gerrymandering is bad but the house being limited to 435 seats fucks over citizens much, much worse.   Even if they fix the districts in Maryland, i'm still going to be forced into a district with people that have different concerns/priorities than me because it needs to be a district of 700k.   Given the beltway style of living in Maryland, we're going to end up having people in far-flung suburbs shacked up in a district with people inside the beltway and they're going to be very poorly represented in Congress. Like, it'll be better, but it's a band-aid on a chainsaw wound."

maryland,3b2ek8,langis_on,8,Thu Jun 25 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"Our districts are a fucking joke. Look at the 7th district FFS. My parents live in Glen Arm, Baltimore County which is less than ten minutes from Harford County. It is a rural, sparsely populated, and mostly republican area. For the longest time my parents were part of the 1st district, now represented by Md's lone republican congressman, Andy Harris. Before that they were represented by Wayne Gilchrist, also a republican, for decades.   Now they are represented by Elijah Cummings. A solidly West Baltimore Democrat who, despite being a politician I like a lot, has absolutely zero in common with my parents, their community, and their interests. I don't even understand why my parents were gerrymandered into the 7th and not lumped into the already conservative 1st, but I do know it's absurd for the same congressman to represent Glen Arm and West Baltimore."
maryland,3b2ek8,thepulloutmethod,10,Thu Jun 25 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"They're in the 7th because that's how gerrymandering works.  You want as many districts as possible to be as close to 51/49 in your favor as possible.  To do this, you include just enough areas that don't vote the way you want, but not so many that the seat goes the other way.  You do this over successive redistrictings, and that's how Maryland goes from having an even split in its Congressional delegation in 2003 to a 7-1 democratic advantage in 2013."

While you are opposed to it (as I would be opposed to it, whether a Republican or Democrat did it), many others are indifferent. Basically, there are masses of Democrats saying it's OK by not saying anything at all. Of course, if Ehrlich had tried to do this, those same indifferent Dems would have probably went nuts with it.

My point is we shouldn't subsidize the raping of the environment in which we live, especially not at the expense of more sustainable options.  Baltimore has pretty bare-bones transit. The Red Line would have offered a stronger link between Metro Subway and Light Rail and would have brought rapid transit access to and from Canton and Highlandtown, to the west side, to Woodlawn.

SC has a lot of investment from both Google and Elon Musk, who sits on their board. They've gotten a lot of gov't work, and large corporation work as well.  They're well poised.  I've worked on solar applications for work before, so I've been following commercial solar developments for the last few years (ie, efficiency ratings, cost, etc).  I got it done this year, and I couldn't have been happier.  SC rep was great, very helpful.  Very professional.  All the guys that came to the house for the work?  All very polite, all very professional, and all seemed to be local maryland guys (which I appreciate).  They did good work, in a timely manner, and I just couldn't have had a more positive experience.  it looks great.  I have one neighbor who didn't go SC.  My observations?  First, their panels don't look as nice.  They don't have the same skirting and low profile install.  They look a little more 'industrial', if that makes sense.  Second, install time.  I have 35 panels (the individual sections) on my house.  Guy across the street has 11.  The SC guys showed up promptly at 7, and were done by 2 - that's including all the electrical work.  The guy across the street had the install group there from at least 0800 (when I left for work), until at least 1900 (when I got home from work).  Third, Professional Appearance / Work.  You know what they did first thing (SC)?  They put up caution tape around my entire property, since they were working on the roof.  They pulled up in a box truck, and a follow car, all shiny with Solar City logos screened on them.  Every one of the guys has a Solar City t-shirt or polo on.  I immediately noticed my neighbors across the street, their crew, no caution tape.  There were multiple vehicles / trucks.  Because they pull GCs in to supplement their crew.  The guy doing the electrical wasn't an employee of the solar company, but an additional person brought in.  It looks like a huge clusterfuck when you have 3-4 vans, and they all have different logos on them.  I'm not saying that it can't work just fine, but I'd rather trust the guys that have everyone needed start to finish on staff, then someone is farming for certain work.  Just my comments.  Had a great experience with Solar City.  Anecdotal / observations from my neighborhood make me trust the others less."

maryland,3aqysd,thepulloutmethod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:48:20 2015 UTC,I'm not a physician so I can't comfortably answer that. Another thing to consider is that rapidly dividing cells also more readily (or quickly) develop further mutations that may result in a clone (variant) that is resistant to whatever treatment is being employed. This is why chemotherapy is given in cocktails (to try several things at once and hope all of the cells are vulnerable to at least one of the drugs) but obviously some make it through the cracks and you see refractory or relapsed disease.

There is nothing any gun control law can do to stop a criminal from finding a firearm to kill with if there are firearms in a majority of homes just waiting to be stolen, borrowed or gifted . I don't know of a single Republican or Democrat calling for an end of gun ownership in the United States, just more kicking the can down the road on this issue."

In Baltimore, over 5x as many people are murdered in the month of May - O'Malley : ""[crickets]""... Unless I missed him talking about how awesome the effects of his policies in Baltimore and Maryland are.   How is that gun control of yours working in Maryland? How would that gun control stop a person from buying and using a weapon as they did in Charleston? What do assault weapons and large capacity magazines and background checks have to do with stopping any of these murders?   Why aren't we pushing for increased free and easy access to mental health facilities? For the end of the war on drugs? For increasing educational and work opportunities for at risk communities? These things will reduce suffering and murder.   If you ever thought politicians cared about anyone, ask why the responses are always to get rid of guns or do nothing at all - but not at all to fix the underlying problem with the people committing the murders.   We aren't perfect people and there will be tragedy, but we can do things that we all agree will help us as a country.

I downvoted you initially. I'll compromise and take the down vote away, but I won't give you an up vote, and here is why:   Your post started with a now-is-not-the-time argument, as if Martin O'Malley is just using this tragedy and these deaths as a platform to push his political agenda, but the same could be said of the anti-gun control crowd who use tragedies like this to stifle the discussion (i.e., now is not the time... and why not?). You imply that gun control isn't working in Maryland, but your belief and some raw numbers don't prove whether it is effective or not, and then you conflate the situation in Maryland with what happened in Charleston. Mental health spending in Maryland is actually relatively high, and a lot of the increases in mental health spending instituted by Martin O'Malley were rolled back by Hogan in his first budget. Do we have to solve every other problem contributing to gun violence before we talk about gun control? The war on drugs is being wound down, by the way. Your post contains a lot of sarcasm."

After I read O'Malley's words, I couldn't help but feel annoyed. Every single policy he mentioned would not stop this tragedy caused by a crazy racist using a gun that was straw purchased (illegally, I presume). So his rant for wanting gun control nation wide does not address how to stop this at all. The only thing I know of that would give a good chance of stopping this event: a good guy with a gun. Gun free zones do not work. People bent on killing others are going to break the law in more than one way, so why restrict others from protecting everyone?   Mental health spending may be high on relative measure - but the repercussions for using it still exist, and access to it is far from ideal given how much relative good it can do to daily life and avoiding tragedies like this. And I'm not just talking about Maryland. I'm also not talking politics (Red vs Blue - what you may be doing by pitting Hogan vs O'Malley policies).   The war on drugs is the root cause for most of America's murders, tons of broken families, and a downward spiral in many people's lives. It is not ""being wound down"". If you want to test this, get caught with a couple vials of crack by the cops and tell me how wound down it is. Tell me how easy it is to get a job afterward. Tell me how easy it is to deal with parole. We have problems that we could fix by helping addicted people - not punishing them. That's a great conversation to have.   We don't have to solve every problem before talking gun control. But the problem is that people want to talk about gun control because 8 people died in a single tragedy that won't repeat itself. On the other hand, 40 died in Baltimore in one month. And that happens every month. The same in Chicago, Detroit, and every other major city. These tragedies that happen every day are by far so much worse, but no one talks about it - there's no push for a national dialogue to fix it like they're is for a one time tragedy. This pisses me off. A lot. If you want to talk about gun control, talk about these things - and not freak incidents where literally the only legal thing that could have stopped it is a good guy with a gun.   If you want to try to improve society here, you have to work to solve those deaths. And gun control isn't going to solve much of it compared to fixing the underlying reasons why people want to kill other people. So before you think about gun control, tell me why we should ignore the causes of suffering that makes many, many people to want to kill others?   Also, as an aside, the majority of people I know advocating for gun control haven't handled a gun and don't know basic gun terminology. Why would I take their thoughts about gun control seriously if they want to ban things that don't make sense (eg barrel shroud, pistol grips, magazines vs clips, etc). This annoys me in the same way that many women get annoyed when old white men write laws dictating what women can do with their body."
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,-5,Sun Jun 21 15:39:48 2015 UTC,Or how about we stop the capitulating to the whims of the NRA and gun manufacturers who have helped craft the lax gun laws we have?
maryland,3ai5mo,oath2order,10,Sat Jun 20 16:31:32 2015 UTC,Look at those lax laws in Baltimore allowing all those murders.
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,-1,Sat Jun 20 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'm more referring to the lax laws nation wide. Local laws tend to not be effective since the local laws in one state may be strict but the laws in another state bordering the first one may be more relaxed, thus making the first state's laws less effective."
maryland,3ai5mo,oath2order,3,Sat Jun 20 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"Potentially true - but I'm pretty sure most murders aren't caused by guns, so why not fix those problems? And buying any gun from any dealer requires a background check in the US. And the type of gun, magazines, and ammunition used in this event are completely standard and legal almost everywhere in the US - so most likely anything but a gun prohibition would have stopped this, aside from the fact that we have a drug prohibition that doesn't work at all - so perchance a gun prohibition wouldn't work at all either. But sure - gun laws.   Also, bending to the whims of the NRA is actually bending to the largest civil rights organization by far in the US - kind of like bending to the whims of the people of the US."
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,-3,Sat Jun 20 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"No, the NRA is run by gun manufacturers. It's only concerned with the 2nd amendment, no more."
maryland,3ai5mo,oath2order,7,Sat Jun 20 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"That may be how you feel, but it is composed of American citizens in excess of 1% of the total US population. You can say ""no"" all you want - a vast number of Americans are NRA members, and these members are a part of the NRA because they value their rights secured by the 2nd Amendment.   I'm not a member because I think they are too politically corrosive; instead I prefer the Second Amendment Foundation. I wish the NRA was only concerned about the 2A, but it isn't. Why can I say this? Because the NRA viciously attacks Democrats as a party (as does their base) - and gun ownership is not a partisan issue."
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,7,Sat Jun 20 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"I never said who ran it. In all honesty the CEO, Wayne Lapierre, runs the NRA. (Side note I find him to be a terrible spokesperson personally). It's not Smith & Wesson, Glock, Ruger, or any other company or combination thereof. And you would think members who thought the NRA was working against them would leave and/or do something about it. But - since the NRA is larger than it's ever been - maybe that's because the membership likes what the NRA does enough to continue being members.   PS - not sure who down voted you. Not I... I only do that to trolls, which you are clearly not. Even though I prefer the use of ""!="" instead. ;-)"
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,-3,Sat Jun 20 18:33:22 2015 UTC,Most murders are caused by guns though.
maryland,3ai5mo,billyhorton,2,Sat Jun 20 19:55:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure guns on their own are pretty peaceful and don't cause any murders. It's the people behind them causing all the violence.
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,3,Sat Jun 20 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with the timing of his message and I don't think he's ""standing on the dead"" to get his point across. This atrocity is legitimately infuriating, and Martin O'Malley is reacting to that with his honestly held views.  Anyway, when would be a better time to talk about it, when people's passions have cooled off and they've forgotten what's at stake? That seems equally self-serving by those against gun control to me."
maryland,3ai5mo,RecordHigh,6,Sat Jun 20 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"The problems causing the violence are solvable. You can talk about those any time. Pretty much all laws would never stop this type of violence aside from gun prohibition, which won't happen until a vast majority of Americans decide to give up their guns.   So - what caused this attack? What causes the majority of gun violence? Talk about that. O'Malley saying he wants to ban assault weapons makes no sense here. Helping fix endemic racism? Nope - not an issue apparently...."
maryland,3ai5mo,macgyversstuntdouble,2,Sat Jun 20 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where the cutoff point for legal guns should be, but I'd set it very low. You want a rifle for hunting, fine. You want a handgun for personal protection, fine. But that's about it. And then I would take the approach the government has been talking with cigarettes: I would tax the shit out of legal guns to the point where most people won't want to or can't afford to pay the price. Fewer guns will presumably reduce the number of mass murderers and the numbers of people killed in situations like the one in Charleston.  We could also do better at identifying mental health problems and providing treatment, but there is always going to be an undercurrent of violence in a country this big, and we can't just lock people up that we consider to be a risk, so we are stuck with violence at some level. No matter what we do, a guy like Dylan Roof or the Sandy Hook killer is unfortunately going to come along every so often. Preventing them from owning or obtaining guns would be a good start, though, so maybe we should institute more rigorous mental health checks for gun ownership.  Investing in education, job training, and providing economic incentives, particularly in poor, high crime areas, are other approaches that should reduce violence in general.  Racism is something that we will never completely solve. We've done an amazing job of reducing institutional racism in the US in the last 70 years to the point where it almost doesn't exist, and we've reduced racism overall considerably, but we will never get to a state of no racism. I would be willing to bet that every country on earth where there are sizeable groups of different races, religions or ethnicities, there are occasional problems like this--it may literally be part of human nature."
maryland,3ai5mo,RecordHigh,5,Sat Jun 20 15:14:54 2015 UTC,You do realize there are more guns than people in the United States? You'd essentially be arresting all the 'black' people on the planet cause the ones in ferguson and baltimore rioted. That's pretty fucking evil.
maryland,3ai5mo,uberbob79,0,Sat Jun 20 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"Read my post again. Ferguson, Baltimore and black people have nothing to do with anything that I proposed. I also didn't mention arresting black people, or anyone else, for that matter. So, I have no idea what you are talking about.  And so what if there are more guns than people in the US... you have to start somewhere. Realistically, no gun control measure would ever be enacted if it confiscated people's existing guns, so existing guns would be grandfathered in as legal. However, if I had my way, I would make it illegal to ever sell those grandfathered guns. It would take decades for those guns to atrophy, but eventually most of them would end up inoperable in someone's closet or mounted over the fireplace as a family antique."
maryland,3ai5mo,RecordHigh,2,Sun Jun 21 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"I was making a comparison to show how stupid your idea was. Banning all the millions of guns for some bad ten thousands of guns is pretty stupid.  Guns if taken care of last nearly forever in people terms.    You'd have to ban tools and plumbing, and chemicals, and plastics too."
maryland,3ai5mo,uberbob79,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:21:47 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to be calling my idea stupid. You can disagree, but why don't you articulate a counter plan to reduce gun violence instead of just being a rude little prick. Actually, never mind, you're just a half-witted dipshit who's probably going to end up shooting himself in some fantastically stupid way and winning a Darwin award at some point, so don't waste your limited mental cycles on it."
maryland,3ai5mo,RecordHigh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to be calling my idea stupid.   The 2010 Census reported 308.7 million people in the United States.    Reviewing CDC data from 2010 for causes of death. Per the CDC 11,078 people died ""due to guns"". Per the CDC 606 people died due to ""accidental discharge of firearms""    Per the CDC 26,009 people died 'due to falling'.    The datas are from ""National Vital Statistics Reports Volume 61, Number 4"""
maryland,3ai5mo,uberbob79,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"So what is your point? Only 11,078 people died, so it's not an important issue? Until we solve deaths from falls we can't tackle deaths from gun violence?  There are differences between these things that you are not acknowledging. Gun deaths are almost 100% preventable by eliminating guns, while death from falls will happen in some significant quantity no matter what is done to prevent them. Gun deaths are also mostly murders, so there are a host of follow on consequences that don't exist for fall deaths. For example, there is rarely a need in fall deaths for a police investigation, court proceedings, jail time, etc...  those things can easily run into the 10s of millions of dollars. And there are psychological costs to gun deaths too. While fall deaths are tragic, the victims friends and family can move on more easily because there are no perpetrators to catch, no anger, no revenge to be had.  Anyway, your whole point here is not to offer anything, but it is to portray my ideas as stupid, so I'm out of here."

I think I learned about this in History class, what happens when the Government taxes something just to be a dick.    So, lets let the actions of the few dictate how we treat the many that follow the law and are responsible? Yeah, that makes sense."
maryland,3ai5mo,xKingNothingx,-2,Thu Jun 25 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does make sense. They wouldn't be taxing it just to be a dick, the government has a compelling interest in reducing gun violence, just like it has a compelling interest in improving the public health by reducing the number of smokers. The government also has to abide by the 2nd Amendment. So, turning a $700 gun into a $7,000 gun via taxes and then charging people $1,000 a year for a gun license serves both interests: fewer guns and fewer gun deaths, but you can still own one if you really need or want to. Hell, I'd even waive the annual fee if the gun owner attends regular training or--I don't know--joins a well-regulated state-sponsored militia.  And your point about the law is moot, because new laws would have to be enacted to implement these requirements, taxes and fees. So pay the taxes and fees that the laws implement and you will be fine."

Im not too familiar with current rent rates, but it should be cheaper than MoCo. There's a daily train that goes into the Shady Grove metro station and then from there you can go anywhere in the DC metro area. Theres also a bunch of buses from Frederick that leave to go into DC, driving is bad, but definitely doable as many people commute from Frederick into Montgomery County/DC/Baltimore regularly. Frederick is a fast growing city, but still has a small town feel. There's lots of outdoorsy things to do as well as many festivals going on all the time. We also have a great downtown area that people from all over Maryland come to see with boutique stores and restaurants. Only negative thing I would see in your case is that I would not say its very good for a young adult in terms of weekend nightlife, but if you have friend's places to stay at when you hit DC I wouldn't see a problem. Highly recommend the area, let me know if you have any specific questions."

It will probably take you around an hour to two hours (really bad) to do the commute. I commuted from Frederick to College Park last summer everyday and the drivers weren't that bad, I'm a pretty aggressive driver and I only got into one spat (flipping the bird, tailgating me) the whole summer. Driving AROUND Frederick is not bad at all if thats what you meant. But you'll love Frederick its a great place to live and raise a family (idk how old you are)."

We both commute through DC to Arlington for work, and it's extremely easy (both driving and via metro).  As much as I love Bethesda, it's very expensive - far overpriced compared to Silver Spring -- and I don't know if you can get what you want for the $1000 price range (but I could be wrong - check it out).  I would recommend looking at apartments in/near downtown.  There are quite a few large and largish complexes that are within easy walking distance of the Metro.   For apartments - look at Summit Hills, The Blairs, or the Twin Towers.  There are quite a few others around the downtown Silver Spring area.  Avoid the Barrington.   Rockville is a nice area, but it's a significantly longer commute into the city.    Silver Spring has its own subreddit (as do Bethesda and Rockville).  It's not extremely active, but it never hurts to post your request there.  Remember, though, Silver Spring is fairly spread out geographically.

People don't have that kind of easy mobility, being forced out of your neighborhood can be a huge financial burden, and there might not be jobs available in the places where you are allowed to live.

After about 9 months you turn in the oysters to be dropped on a reef somewhere.  And about 3 months later you get a new batch of oysters.  CBF is one way to get involved. http://www.cbf.org/oysters"

I personally love Gambrill State Park. Lots of trails, well marked, variety. Some easy XC type stuff, some climbs & descents, some ass-kicking rocky stuff. I do it on my hardtail, but mostly in the snow. Here's the Yellow trail, https://www.strava.com/segments/933573  If you want to get your ass kicked and wonder how 5 miles took you so long, go to Frederick Watershed.

A little expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  The Annapolis Mall theater is pretty good. I've never been disappointed there.  Hoyts off Nursery road is a good cheaper theater.

During the behind the wheel lessons, my brother went to make a left at an intersection, but the road he was turning on to was inclined. His driving instructor told him he is not allowed to use the gas when making a turn. In this case the car slowed to a stop in the intersection. My brother tried to tap the gas to get out of the intersection, but the driving instructor hit the break. They were literally sitting in the middle of a intersection because the driving instructor was too stupid to realize that they needed the gas to get up a hill. They blocked traffic and even after the light turned red the instructor wouldn't let him move. My brother had to tap the gas to move a few inches every time the instructor took his foot off the break. He eventually made it out of the intersection and the instructor allowed him to use the gas again.       I've also seen their instructors pull stupid and illegal stuff before too. Like one time I was picking my husband up at the metro when a Greg's Driving school car parked in the middle of the lane blocking all traffic. The instructor got out of the car and switched with the student who was in the passenger seat."

Though our marketing guy is often in the building working outside those hours and he is likely to answer the phone if he is there.  The seating is 2 steps or about 1-1.5 feet raised off the ground. You are sitting to the right side of the stage (Think of an upside down ""L"", the raised seating would be the long vertical line). Typically we have 4-5 rows of 3 tables each, the best view obviously being the end seats, but the view is pretty good from anywhere in the room. We typically fill in the tables by date of purchase so earliest bought tickets get the outside row then we fill in.  The show package besides reserved seating gets you $20 in gift credit and a server for the evening.

maryland,39gkba,shuddertostink,6,Thu Jun 11 20:08:18 2015 UTC,At this point there's a LOT of illegal catches going on.  Even oyster reefs that have been built and monitored have been raided by locals and professional oystermen.  Here's an article on it:  http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-oyster-enforcement-20150404-story.html#page=1  Basically crabs recover quickly since their lifecycle is just a few years.  Oysters take much longer since they live to be 20-30.

maryland,39apzy,nachosmmm,2,Wed Jun 10 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"People project their feelings on the subject onto the art - people that are closer to the subject matter will probably react more strongly.  I think your dad (and other very offended people) are seeing the officer as representative of all officers, which maybe it is (i seriously doubt that).  The majority of people recognize that there are good cops and bad cops like there are good doctors and bad doctors and so on.  The art didn't name any officer and the one shown is hardly characterized anyways - it has no face, no expression, nothing besides a newspaper in its hand.  It could be anyone or it could be no one.  Or it could be a stand in for the bad cops (the most likely case).  As for the ""support"" topic, art doesn't have to support anyone or anything - in fact a lot of art is used to point out flaws or bad things in the world.  He needs to get over it and realize the art wasn't directed at him (unless he really is a racist cop who acts upon his inherent prejudices) and realize it is trying to convey a message of peace and understanding.  Respect is earned through deeds, if he wants support, then he should make damn sure he does his job properly, calls out corruption and unethical behavior in his peers and continue to be the good cop I'm sure he is."

maryland,39apzy,nachosmmm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"I read this art piece as saying that if a cop is killed in the line of duty, social justice (which of course is different from legal justice) says revenge is justified, even at the cost of the lives of criminals when necessary.  To me this instalation shows that the death of a ""cop killer"" is justice in its purest form.  Now, do I agree with murder?  No.  But that's how I interpreted the art: as a piece that values the lives of cops above an ordinary man for the great service they give.  Completely different from how your father and yourself appear to have interpreted it.  Funny how good art elicits different reactions and interpretations from different people.  Art, even in this case, isn't always so black and white.  Your dad needs to understand that how he views the piece may not be how the piece was intended, or even how others view it."
maryland,39apzy,Theta_Zero,2,Sat Jun 13 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"I think that it is a vaild piece of art, weather i agree with it or not. But if the artist was hoping for open representation, maybe a display not in the middle of a school would have been a better option.  Weather it is right or wrong to take down the art, the artist should have known this was going to create waves. Maybe that's why it was done? But I feel that to get the message across, the artist would want his or her work to remain visible for as long as possible and the front lobby of a high school does not seem to be the best place for that."
maryland,39apzy,Miataguy94,7,Wed Jun 10 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"The article states that it was student created - they were tasked to show what social justice means to them.  The entire point of the assignment was to have people reflect on what is happening in society around them and if things are truly socially just.  When things are not just, then things will look ugly - and they should because unjust situations are inherently ugly/distasteful because those who find it unjust feel that it shouldn't be happening.  As for the art itself, this is pretty tasteful - it doesn't show the officer with a gun or threatening the black person, he's reading the obituary.  People see it as disrespectful for some reason, but I don't see a positive or negative portrayal of officers in this piece.  In actuality, I'd see the officer's inclusion as reading the obituaries as telling that the artist wants to show them positively - an uncaring officer wouldn't be looking at the obituaries.  Maybe the artist could have shown him more positively, but what is there isn't disrespectful."
maryland,39apzy,FFF12321,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can really say this was created to show the officer in a positive light.  While you say he being shown positively for reading the paper but it could be seen as him enjoying his kill.  I personally find the art disrespectful simply because it profiles but that does not mean I believe it should not have made. I feel that if the artist created this with one officer in mind it makes sense but if the artist is saying that every white police officer is out to kill black people, there is some crazy profiling going on.   If the artist feels a certain way, they show it in their art. But to assume that something in a public school suggesting another public office is corrupt will remain there for long is ignorant. Is that just? Not sure. But if I were the artist, I would not logically say that my piece will be displayed for long."
maryland,39apzy,Miataguy94,2,Wed Jun 10 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"obviously the overall intent of the piece is to highlight the tension felt between police officers and the general public, but with specific reference to recent violence against black people (whether justified or not).    So how should the artist have represented the concept of ""The Police"" if showing a single person is profiling in your opinion (I don't think showing only 1 officer and it being white is profiling all white officers, but is highlighting that the recent string of violence against blacks by officers has been mostly perpetrated by white officers again regardless of whether or not the violence was justified).  If the officer was shown as black, then you could say they are also profiling black officers or whatever it is.  You'd have to make an argument that this officer is representative of his whole race and occupation but not a minority officer in the same art.  Honestly, who knows if the artist wanted it up for a long time - it was in a HS, so the only people seeing it would be students, faculty and visitors to that school.  But by getting it removed they get press which spreads it out to more people right?  And again, it was an assignment so who's to say they were really aiming for a big deal anyways?"

I do think this is a little much for a high school, where it's prominently on display.  The point was 'social justice'.  I fail to see how this is suppose to embody that - enough to warrant a central display in the HS.  I feel like it's 'social justice' in the same way you'd see a stereotypical tumblr SJW define 'social justice'.  I get the point of exaggeration and hyperbole with art - the same way that political cartoons often employ caricatures of individuals (ie, highly exaggerated to show a point).  You've got 'handsupdon'tshoot' on that display.  That's a narrative that's been disproved.  Honestly, I question its value as true art.  I think it's more purposefully inciteful, more interested in providing some 'shocking' display that makes some teenager think they're terribly creative and clever.  And honestly, I think it is a rather violent image to have kids walking past everyday.  I'm not naive to what kids are exposed to, or the reality of today's society, but I don't think it needs to be shoved in to their face in this manner."

Harm reduction policies are used to manage behaviors such as recreational drug use and sexual activity in numerous settings that range from services through to geographical regions. Critics of harm reduction typically believe that tolerating risky or illegal behaviour sends a message to the community that such behaviours are acceptable and that some of the actions proposed by proponents of harm reduction do not reduce harm over the long term.

What they tell me has happened is that back in the day, the men did the fishing, their wives and daughters would do the picking.

Assuming the minimum wage is set reasonably (remember O'Malley signed in the minimum wage increase) I don't see a problem with paying people minimum wage for this work.  It doesn't surprise me that native workers don't want to do this because a worker with no education can make more money simply by being able to speak English and working in the service industry.

In order to encourage industrial mobilization an award was created to encourage production of war time materials.

Government as well as privately owned plants were eligible, as were contractors.    Some factors which were considered in selecting recipients were: -Quality and quantity of production -Overcoming of production obstacles -Avoidance of work stoppages -Maintaining of fair labor standards -Training of additional labor forces -Good record keeping in relation to health and safety    I don't know who earned it (wasn't my great grandmother for sure, maybe a boyfriend or another relative) but its kinda neat to know that whoever did may have known the person pictured here."

If Hogan is looking at this from a economic return on state money, purple line may or may not win out. The maglev is merely a notion right now, while the purple line is a designed project with federal dollars on the table.  The $10 billion figure is also misleading. Any future such project would be funded largely by federal and Japanese funds, with likely substantial state buy-in.

maryland,389yi1,astpm4815,2,Tue Jun 2 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure.  I would think you just lost out on a potential registration refund?  I doubt there is an actual fine.  People ""lose"" tags sometimes. Worst case scenario I see is you would need to order replacement tags, and then return them...so a $20 fine. But I doubt you would need to do that if this is the only issue.  However the important question that could change all this: Do you currently have car insurance?  MVA should have informed you if they were informed that your insurance was cancelled, but who knows.  There could potentially be very heft fines."
maryland,389yi1,sadpanda34,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:21:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. With the car sold and no plates to show is where the issue begins. If I recall correctly, I accrued a $150 fine on an old JEEP I sold because either the MVA lost them or I trusted the kid, who never responded, to return them. Thus, insurance fine. I've bought and sold many since then and never had an issue. For future reference, always get a receipt so you have proof. And yes, I did have to provide my receipt number once to avoid a fine."

maryland,389yi1,sadpanda34,2,Tue Jun 2 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm well it's probably a crap shoot.  Its a good sign that you didn't get any notices, especially because you got a registration notice.   Meaning they have a current address for you, so they should have notified you of an insurance lapse.  In any case certainly don't volunteer the information that your insurance has lapsed.  Good luck."
maryland,389yi1,sadpanda34,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:22:37 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it only be an issue if I took the vehicle for a drive?  Why would I need insurance on a car no longer in my possession?
maryland,389yi1,Troggie42,2,Tue Jun 2 23:27:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, however if they have already processed a fine you would probably have to fight it.  The MVA website says:   WARNING:  Do not cancel your insurance until you are sure that the MVA has received your license plates.  Failure to do so could result in a large fine.   I'm not saying it makes sense, but it's what bureaucracies do."
maryland,389yi1,shessolovely,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they don't fuck around with those insurance fines. $150 for the first month and then $7 a day after that... At least when I got in trouble with it. When you sell a car, don't ever cancel the insurance FIRST, lol."
maryland,389yi1,Troggie42,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:09:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the MVA charges pretty hefty fines if you have an active registration/active license plates and no insurance. The fine is $150 for 1-30 days, then an additional $7 a day after the initial 30 days. I believe the maximum is $1000, and not paying the fine can cause your license to be suspended."

Short answer-go to your local DMV and tell them your situation.  There is a form (I don't know the name or number) that you can fill out that covers this situation.  Get a copy of the receipt, because you'll probably still get letters from the state DMV trying to fine you.  If you do get such a letter then call the state DMV help line number and explain the situation over the phone to them.  Be  patient-this took me two or three calls to get it worked out.

The market in Baltimore is flooded with rehabbed empty homes and middle class families selling. That and the taxes, insurance rates and crime statistics are sky high. Don't even get me started on the atrocious city public education system.  There are a lot of great things about Baltimore, unfortunately the bad significantly out weigh the good right now.  This is going to be one extremely violent summer."

Now, there are houses built up from being back loaded from before the housing crisis; its been that way for longer than the last 2 months. This is a bad situation but dont make it into more than it is."

maryland,384s4t,Beer_O_Lantern,9,Tue Jun 2 12:15:14 2015 UTC,This. I highly doubt the gangs killing each other bothered to obtain their weapons legally.
maryland,384s4t,RoboRay,8,Tue Jun 2 12:26:45 2015 UTC,They aren't using the kind of guns that were banned.  Never have.
maryland,384s4t,CactusInaHat,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:00:02 2015 UTC,It's a non issue because the criminals are for sure NOT obtaining the weaponry through legal means.   Whats unhelpful is that 2/5 of the main comments on this are people whining about their gun rights being restricted; there's a bigger issue at hand that greater Maryland loves to ignore
maryland,384s4t,RoboRay,4,Tue Jun 2 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"There is no bigger issue than self-defense.  If you don't have the right to keep yourself alive, all other rights are voided."

I bought my dad an AR because he's accurate with it, it's comfortable for him to shoot despite his shoulder injury, it fires an effective round, and it's equipped with sights he can see without reading glasses. I base my self defense methods on reality, not feels."
maryland,384s4t,CactusInaHat,-3,Tue Jun 2 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"Good on you, it's a good weapon, and it IS good for self defense.  It's hardly necessary to defend your home though."
maryland,384s4t,narcedmonkey,7,Tue Jun 2 18:45:41 2015 UTC,the AR15 is excellent for self defense and defense of your home.  its long enough and light enough for even small framed women to control and rifles are much more accurate than handguns.  take a woman shooting and give her an AR15 and a pistol and ask which one they are more comfortable with.
maryland,384s4t,CactusInaHat,-4,Tue Jun 2 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Whats interesting is it's still legal to purchase many carbines for home defense in Maryland. Take the sub2000 for example.  So again; how is this more important than fixing all of the social and government failure causing these crime waves across the country.
maryland,384s4t,narcedmonkey,5,Tue Jun 2 15:29:12 2015 UTC,in my book defending Constitutionally affirmed rights is the most important function of government.    these crime waves are scumbag criminals killing people over drug turf.  the only social and gov't failings are the 5+ decades of dependence constructed by Democrat governance.
maryland,384s4t,CactusInaHat,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"Look; I'm not going to sit here and defend the actions of city or state legislation over the last half century. However, those scumbags may not exist at all today if the aforementioned institutional failings had not occurred.  I agree with you that government should prioritize defending constitutional rights; I'd cite the 8th and 14th amendment being very relevant these days."
maryland,384s4t,aresef,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:49:36 2015 UTC,Is it still legal in Baltimore and Maryland to keep and bear a firearm? Yes? Then you got nothing.  The Democratic Party didn't cause Baltimore's downturn. White-built power structures did. Wells Fargo did. Beth Steel's bankruptcy did.

maryland,384s4t,Keedy_Black_AMA,0,Tue Jun 2 11:35:47 2015 UTC,Why do they specifically need a handgun? What about a  carbine or shotgun. As far as I know it's going to be $400+ for a gun of any type and appropriate storage. Low-income families would be stretched to afford that anyways.  Wouldn't they be better choices for home protection anyways?  I personally don't think the right to bear arms is as important as most here do but I recognize that it is a constitutional right should be respected as such.
maryland,384s4t,illpoet,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"well its not that they specifically need a handgun, its that they can't legally have one easily thanks to the firearms safety thing.  As far as the best weapon for home defense, its a hotly debated topic and at the end of the day its a person's choice what works best for them."
maryland,384s4t,Beer_O_Lantern,4,Wed Jun 3 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"So require safes in the city, not a prohibition for law abiding citizens. Gang members could give a shit about laws and restrictions.

The mortgage crisis and predatory lending tactics screwed a lot of people out of their homes and money, and definitely screwed minorities more so. I'm glad lenders and mortgage brokers are now subject to more regulation, and even Realtors have to take fair housing and predatory lending classes to retain their license. The good news is the housing market is definitely on the rise and it's a good time to buy a home. I became a Realtor in 2013, I work mainly in the central MD/Anne Arundel area and half of my clients are black. Everyone who's purchasing right now, taking advantage of low prices and low interest rates, I think they're making a great choice in terms of a long-term investment.

Martin O'Malley -- who as mayor met with the Algebra Project and supported its quest for more state funding -- has now frozen the inflationary increases provided to school systems under the Thornton legislation (a statewide education funding initiative that grew out of the school funding lawsuit in the city). In Baltimore, that freeze will amount to a $50 million budget shortfall for next school year."" source This is of course glossing over the casinos that were pushed and insisted on using some of that to help fund schools being directed elsewhere.

Came back from TN to find a dozen letters from local lawyers telling me I could end up in jail if I don't lawyer up!

Anyway, VA is full of shit.  At least compared to Delaware, the taxes there are ridiculous...   the income tax is almost the same, but unlike Delaware they give zero breaks to seniors on pensions or social security.  Real estate tax is also similar to Delaware, at least in the town I have a house in.  The car property tax.  Every single year you have to pay a few points on the book value of your car to the county, and in some cases, the town you live in -- unless your car is under $1000 in value.  So poor folk just have about 4 junkers parked in front of their house. If one doesn't start one morning, they'll try the others until one works, then hack the busted car later when they have time.  Car inspection. Every single year you have to get your car thoroughly inspected at a dealer or service station and get a stupid sticker stuck in your windshield The stupid fucking front license plate requirement (Oh, sorry MD) Sales tax (sorry again MD)   Anyway, I chuckle about VA because Delaware is about as blue as you can get, and the taxes there are much lower.  It's also why I keep my cars registered in Delaware.  On the plus side, my town in VA provides trash service for $8/month (how socialistic of them) while in Delaware I'm forced to use a private company for $60/month."

Ellicott City and Columbia are also nice, but are more expensive.  In fact it is worth noting that Howard County is among the wealthiest counties in the nation (second-highest median household income in 2013), but is worth the extra dough if you have it in my opinion.

Our new ""no tax"" governor has just rolled back the tolls which I'm sure is/will be popular though it's not clear how the reduced revenue will affect the bonding or maintenance. There is lots of ongoing maintenance on the Bay Bridge in particular, and talk of additional system expansion (particularly on the Nice bridge which is US 301). It also supports our recently constructed freeway, the ICC, about half of which (some $500-600M) is paid for in toll backed revenue bonds.

maryland,36wxoo,xKingNothingx,17,Sat May 23 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"Well it's the law, so whatever you say.   Under MD law, paraphernalia includes all equipment and materials used in the use, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana. This includes all agricultural materials used in the growing process, including electronic equipment and typical gardening supplies, such as lights, fertilizer, and top soil. §5-101 also includes under its definition items such as scales, plastic bags, and others used in the distribution process. Hash bubble sacks are paraphernalia. These items are joined by the typical forms of paraphernalia involved in the ingestion of marijuana, including pipes, bongs, and roach clips. Rolling papers and blunt wraps are not included under the statutory definition.  from  http://norml.org/laws/item/maryland-penalties-2  look it up here    http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcr&section=5-101&ext=html&session=2015RS&tab=subject5"

The reasons he cited were very disheartening... he thinks it will help the states fight against heroin, when clearly the war on drugs is failing heroin addicts (they need treatment, not asset seizures). Furthermore he cited a slippery slope argument -- supposedly drug crimes are linked to gun smuggling and human trafficking. I'd call bullshit; I'd like to see his actual data on that."

maryland,36wxoo,dbto,-2,Fri May 22 20:26:34 2015 UTC,"In the case of marijuana, getting caught with any amount will remain a criminal charge: so potential for jail time, criminal record, etc... The bill would have made possession of up to 10 grams a civil offense so there would be a fee and that's about it along with encouraging the police not to waste their time for stuff like this.   see /u/dbto's comment  Hogan also repealed a $300 threshold for civil asset forfeiture. Now this concept is plain old evil. While we're not as bad as Pennsylvania, getting off funding police through stealing from citizens is still a good goal. John Oliver recently devoted a segment to the horrors of forfeiture which makes the case better than I can."
maryland,36wxoo,dbto,19,Fri May 22 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"The Marijuana Decrim Bill was signed by O'Malley and went into effect this year. The bill vetoed by Hogan was to treat marijuana paraphernalia as a similar offense with just a civil fine. Currently, you can suffer much harsher penalties for the bag the weed was in than you would for the weed itself. Totally BS. This is a stupid fight for Hogan to make a point of. He could have also just not signed them into law, and they would have passed by June 30, I think automatically. But, no, he had to go and veto that shit. What a douche.   Maryland would see a HUGE fiscal benefit from taxing and regulating cannabis like alcohol or tobacco.  But, instead, we have an anemic and non-working medical cannabis law, a Decrim law (not a bad thing, but come on...it's a plant), and a shitty old law that lets people get heavily fined and/or incarcerated for cannabis paraphernalia."

Baltimore City has a much larger property tax rate than the rest of the state, but the rest of the state is pretty close.  You can't afford rent around here because the US government's presence artificially inflates the cost of living in the region. You could move a little further out, try Carroll County, or Frederick County, if it's eating you alive.

maryland,36pu6n,mostlyjustgames,2,Thu May 21 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"I like the Alaska/Atlantic stand on the boardwalk for quick food, and Marty's Playland as an arcade. Mother's Cantina has some great Mexican food, which is next to the downtown Fractured Prune. Lots of mini golf in that same area. Midtown has your Fagers or your Seacrets for all your hookup needs. Uptown has some nice spots too like Jules or Blue Ox. Buffets are on the outs but there is a new one just opening up uptown Tokyo Buffet with sushi and Chinese food. August is the White Marlin Open and the weigh in is something to see if you can get close enough. Half the town will be there. There will be an ultimate frisbee tournament on the 15th.

Hogan put that money originally in the budget for pensions because he wants the fund back on track and the legislature earmarked it for education in an attempt to strong arm him to spend the money now.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/md-dollars-for-schools-or-pensions/2015/05/17/677b383c-fb44-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html
maryland,36gv01,oraclizer,7,Tue May 19 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"Wow... guess the DOJ requirement to relieve overcrowding doesn't enter into your equation. Or how having a juvenile detention facility with education and training is a much better option than incarceration in an adult facility. Guess you overlooked that it was O'Malley who agreed to DOJ oversight, and who wanted to build a $70 million facility in 2012 but could find the money and the project was dropped.  Personally I'm glad Hogan won. Brown was a terrible candidate and there was zero evidence he could run anything successfully esp. a state facing the fiscal issues that Maryland now has. Do you think he was going to eliminate anything that was enacted during his term as Lt. Gov. under O'Malley?  Also, no one likes to mention the ongoing structural deficits that the Purple Line will cost in the future. Or that Parsons Brinkhoff always overestimated the benefits of light rail development for other cities that built it. To make the Purple Line feasible at all it would have to be the 3rd busiest in the nation yet we lack the population to make that happen."
maryland,36gv01,sydtron,8,Tue May 19 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"Also, no one likes to mention the ongoing structural deficits that the Purple Line will cost in the future.    What about the structural deficit of, y'know, reducing the tolls?  The bridges and tunnels aren't going to magically take care of themselves. Just because the trucking industry has enough money and power to tell Hogan what to do means he doesn't get to use that ""structural deficit"" excuse.  edit: Or, according to this article, his excuse means even less when golfers from DC who tell Hogan what to do"
maryland,36gv01,sydtron,-1,Tue May 19 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"Forget about the insane amount of money that it will take to build this line.   You mean less than what it will cost the state for 6 years of his ridiculous crony-capitalist handouts to the trucking industry with the toll reduction? Think about that insane amount of money he's giving away and expecting the rest of us to foot the bill in the future for repairs necessary.   It has already VASTLY overrun it't initial estimated costs, and it has taken far longer than expected.   That's the nature of building anything, ever.    If you were in his position, you'd do the same damn thing.   Not really, because only a lunatic thinks that the car culture in America will remain in place as is."
maryland,36gv01,sydtron,2,Tue May 19 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"What is your source attributing the toll reductions to ""ridiculous crony-capitalist handouts to the trucking industry?"" Could it have been, just possibly, that a large portion of the state, especially people who live on the eastern shore and have to commute everyday across the bridge, wanted them lowered? Hate to break it to you, but your cringe-worthy use of buzzwords make you sound like one of those lunatics in the Politico comments section"
maryland,36gv01,Htay9500,2,Tue May 19 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"Could it have been, just possibly, that a large portion of the state, especially people who live on the eastern shore    The Eastern Shore accounts for 8% of Maryland, which isn't a large portion of the state.   wanted them lowered?   Everyone wants to pay less, but no one wants to pay for what we have. Hence why Maryland is crumbling, along with much of the rest of the country.  I'd love to just pay less on my mortgage or utilities and just say ""well I want it to be less"" but in the end, I don't have that option. Irresponsible spending habits by Hogan shouldn't be seen as something to be praised. Part of being an adult is being responsible for the things you use."
maryland,36gv01,oraclizer,2,Tue May 19 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Not really, because only a lunatic thinks that the car culture in America will remain in place as is.   What makes you say that?"
maryland,36gv01,advising,2,Tue May 19 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"Kinda funny then that the Chevy Chase Land Company stands to profit handsomely should the purple line actually receive the green light. I thought the developers were the bad people in this argument?  Of course it doesn't matter to the people along Wayne Avenue who will lose most of the frontage because of the purple line. Or the at-grade crossing cluster f*cks at Connecticut Avenue, Georgia Avenue, University Blvd, etc. to name a few. Or the tunnel boring disruptions through low and middle-class neighborhoods. None of that goes into the equation... just some golfers who donated to his campaign."
maryland,36gv01,kevlarcupid,2,Tue May 19 21:12:43 2015 UTC,At grade crossing at Connecticut is only being proposed by the Hogan adminstration as a cost cutting measures. The current plan has a bridge for both the PL and the trail.
maryland,36gv01,oraclizer,2,Tue May 19 17:48:19 2015 UTC,You know what relieves overcrowding? Not putting folks in jails for multi-year terms on convictions for possession offenses. Boom. How do you like that? I just freed up $30M that can go back to education.
