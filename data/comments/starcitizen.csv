starcitizen,3e2yjl,Nehkara,22,Tue Jul 21 15:39:21 2015 UTC,When we started designing the Starliner we knew we were going to fill a niche in the 'verse.  However our market analysis did not come close to the actual ship sales we achieved.  Needless to say we have now have to run shifts 24 hours a day to meet our pre-orders.   We're very excited so many citizens have come forward to support our dream.
starcitizen,3e2yjl,CrusaderIndustries,10,Tue Jul 21 16:04:10 2015 UTC,Thank you Crusader for providing an official response!  I look forward to seeing your Starliner in the 'Verse and congratulations on the success of your pre-sale!
starcitizen,3e2yjl,lewomble,3,Tue Jul 21 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Great job Nehkara, tis astounding the amount of time and effort you put into, well, everything Star Citizen.  Thankyou"
starcitizen,3e2yjl,bigolenate,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:23 2015 UTC,INN has really been knocking it out of the park the past couple months! This is awesome stuff
starcitizen,3e2yjl,SunfighterG8,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"I think as a numbers guy its questionable to call the sale a success. If you are going to go through all the pains of comparing all the sales than the numbers should speak the story. Not what CIG claims they expected. I think you put too much weight into what CIG said vs what the numbers told. Because I believe there was a possible issue here from CIG that needs to be addressed. In either they failed to convince the community of the worth of this ship in the universe, or they may of priced it too high. I dont want to see this mistake happen again for future sales.  Because to be honest, I do not really buy that they expected the ship to under perform as much as it did. Sure they may of expected less, but 296%+ less than the current average hourly intake from a concept sale is quite a large gap that indicates there was a bigger issue.  The niche explanation is also questionable as nearly all the ships in the concept sale have been niche in their own right. Granted their sizes of their niches can explain some of the difference, but I dont fathom such a massive difference as the numbers show.   Plus the average concept intake could actually be higher due to one of the lower performing sales (Star-G) being more of a hybrid concept/variant sale than an actual true concept sale. As its intake would be substantially lower due to the melting effect as many original starfarer owners paid only a nominal ""upgrade"" fee. Take that one out and this ship under performed by 324% per hour.  Maybe its true that this ship was just an outlier but to accept it as a success without taking into account possible issues that occurred with the sale seems like a mistake. The numbers just do not add up to this being successful."
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Rand0mtask,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"oh fuck off with this corporate boardroom ""everything must smash all records"" bullshit  you're part of the problem  the starliner is a very niche ship for people looking for a very specific experience, and it sold exactly as well as anyone would expect it to  frankly, i'm impressed by CIG refusing to overmarket a ship to people who probably wouldn't need it, and instead focusing on the interesting nuts and bolts of that gameplay mechanic"
starcitizen,3e2yjl,SunfighterG8,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:07 2015 UTC,The ENTIRE premise of the OPs post is to compare the concept sale performance to the other ones. So take the knee jerk reaction and the stick out of your ass for a second junior and maybe accept the circumstance that maybe something could be improved in the future and that not everything that isnt hailing CIG is something that deserves to be ridiculed.
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Rand0mtask,3,Tue Jul 21 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure where I disagreed with OP's premise. Perhaps you could point that out? Comparing ship sales and quantifying them as successes or failures are two different things. You'll understand that when you grow up, kiddo."
starcitizen,3e2yjl,imperialparadox,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"Question: Let's say that CIG makes a ship, whose design cost was about $500,000 (this is just a made up number, but I'm talking about artists pay, animator pay, and the like). Let's then say that CIG sold five of them, for $500 each, meaning that the entire sale made CIG $2500.  Would you be applauding them then? Seriously, would you consider it a good move to invest half a million in resources for a few thousand in return? What if they did this several times in a row? Would it reach a point where you felt that they were wasting backer money?"
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Rand0mtask,3,Tue Jul 21 19:55:25 2015 UTC,Ship production isn't solely about sales. The starliner is necessary for the universe. Its design bringing in money is a bonus.
starcitizen,3e2yjl,imperialparadox,0,Tue Jul 21 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, lots of things are necessary for the game. There is a point where you could get carried away with it though. Having 500 niche ships is rather pointless if it consumes all of the games funding, to the point where it can't be finished.  I'm just doing this as a thought exercise though, because I can see the point of the Starliner in the PU (though I still question why it costed so much)."
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Rand0mtask,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right about that, but I think a common transport ship is absolutely necessary."
starcitizen,3e2yjl,imperialparadox,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"Thing is, we have no way to really know if the sale really did go as they expected, or if that's just PR-speak to cover the fact that it was a relatively low-seller."
starcitizen,3e2yjl,BrewMagoo,5,Tue Jul 21 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the success of the sale. However, I can't help but wonder how much the sales would have been affected if you had offered a stripped down cargo only version of the ship for a lower price (i.e. $250). I would be willing to bet that not just a greater quantity would have been sold, but a greater value of sales. However, since the sale seems to have stressed your production capacity to its maximum, perhaps it's a good thing you didn't offer the lower priced model."

starcitizen,3e2yjl,wilic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:21 2015 UTC,Would you care to comment on the recent rumors that have begun circulating the verse regarding defective power cells located within the aft section of the Genesis Starliner? Anonymous sources are stating having witnessed an unusual burning smell emanating from this section of the ship during qdrive travel. Was this problem responsible for hindering your recent ship sale efforts?
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Shanesan,4,Tue Jul 21 16:20:01 2015 UTC,I’m sure there are many Citizens out there who either aren’t interested or want to wait to acquire the ship in-game.   I must say that this reason is incomplete.  I believe that fewer people picked up the Starliner because they are wary over what exactly you'll be able to do with the ship other than cart NPCs about all day as we've seen in space games of the past.   I feel Cloud Imperium should have added samples of potential issues or events to the pamphlet.
starcitizen,3e2yjl,BoboMatrix,4,Tue Jul 21 17:17:20 2015 UTC,Would have sold like hotcakes (which I found are pancakes?) if it was priced at $200-250 range.
starcitizen,3e2yjl,Alysianah,8,Tue Jul 21 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"They said the pricing was in line with it's role.  They saw it as ""end game"" with the potential to generate nice income.  They didn't want every other person having one.  I jumped on board the minute I saw it. It's a new role/profession not seen in any MMO before, let alone space sim.  We knew mining and salvage would make an appearance - that's common fare, although SC is spicing it way up.  But civilian transport is completely new and I wanted to give it ago, making salvage a secondary trade."

starcitizen,3e2yjl,Altaweir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"As one of the whales who voted for a civilian transport* I was interested in becoming a civilian transport pilot. Transporting citizen instead of cargo increases the stakes and makes your trip a much more interesting endeavor, and can generate an interesting amount of money without having to bother searching for local merchants to get rid of your cargo.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the Genesis Starliner. The design of the ship is okay but 40 seat is definitely too low a capacity in my humble opinion. I wasn't really moved either by the fix-a-console and make-a-cocktail minigames - I want to be a goddam pilot, not some lousy cabin entertainer!  Throw in some security issues (terrorism, ransom from organ mafia, pirate attack on your way to a remote location, VIP transport...) and that would have made my day. Or just keeping the passengers safe and unaware after having suffering massive damage to port engine after this encounter in the asteroid belt, playing with flight path to get on destination earlier by entering the landing queue faster... But I digress.  I really thought there would have been ways of making civilian transport interesting and I wasn't very impressed by the ones designed by CIG so far. So I'm one of the many who didn't purchase the Starliner and it's not just a question of money.  *Note: from a discussion with the Concierge it's clear that votes aren't anonymous at all - CIG knows who voted what, and can weight the overall outcome of concept polls with the purchasing power / previous amount spent by various voters. For example, it's unsure that an Aurora owner will spend $400 on a concept sale but an Orion or 690 Jump owner is more likely to. They can use the data to figure out the potential outcome of a given concept sale."

Many single-player games can take 3-5 years if they are simple and contain only one of the layers here (like FPS), but many feature-packed MMOs now-a-days take around 6-7 years.  Plus people are used to only waiting a year or so for a non-crowdfunded game because they didn't really hear about it until it had a few years of work in it already where here we are waiting start to finish.

starcitizen,3e22dr,Cplblue,4,Tue Jul 21 14:49:24 2015 UTC,Well it costs money to run servers as well as keep the company running.  Not to mention after release they're still going to be adding to the game and make improvements.
starcitizen,3e22dr,x5060,5,Tue Jul 21 11:24:44 2015 UTC,It is funding all 4 studios for the next few years.
starcitizen,3e22dr,MrHazardous,6,Tue Jul 21 13:22:17 2015 UTC,4 very expensive studios. People don't really know how expensive that is.
starcitizen,3e22dr,skunimatrix,3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"At least $30M per year at this point going forward.  And that's a very low figure of just employees, contractors, and office leases.  Doesn't include things like server time, bandwidth, utilities, bank fees, etc.."
starcitizen,3e22dr,forrestthewoods,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:39 2015 UTC,A few years? If only! I doubt they have 12 months of burn in the bank. Maybe less. Which means they need more money.  Question 1) How much of the 85m has RSI/CIG spent? Question 2) How much more is needed to achieve the currently planned goals?  I don't know these numbers. I suspect if they became public knowledge the project would immediately cave in on itself.
starcitizen,3e22dr,knightedchaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:08 2015 UTC,"You have to account that for the first few years their operating costs were much lower then they currently stand. Yes, they have continuously been scaling up but at the end of 2013 they only had 59 people, roughly 1/5 their current staff, even at the end of last year they had 1 fewer studios and only 70% of the current staff. So it is really hard to estimate how much they have spent so far, we have to trust they have accountants for the financial planning side of things to take care of the budgets and adjust as necessary."
starcitizen,3e22dr,x5060,0,Tue Jul 21 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"CR has said they have held back plenty of money to make the game feature complete at this point even if funding stopped entirely.

I want to fly my ship in a persistent universe.  That's what I bought into.  Chris' comments are not addressing the issue.  Scope and quality are two entirely different things.  I don't think ANYONE would have been disappointed if they had released the combat sim first then released Squadron 42, Star Marine and Planetside later.  To me Star Citizen was about quality and no-compromise.  That's not the same as developing multiple games at the same time and calling them ""Star Citizen"".  I mean think about where the backer money is going.  It's on SHIPS.  That's what we want.  To fly our ships.  I'm not seeing 80MM being spent on hairstyles for our Star Marine character...."

starcitizen,3e22dr,mukku88,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:39 2015 UTC,"Ok the FPS and Planetside are core parts the PU, not feature creep.

The only ships that we’ve seen knife-fight successfully so far this patch are the M50 and (in the hands of a capable pilot), to some extent, the P-52.   No argument regarding the M50, but I have to say based on my admitedly limited experience testing out the  in the 1.1.5 PTU build that both the Avenger and the Merlin were more than capable of engaging in knife-fighting.   This line could use some further explaination:   Spirals are good because (unlike pure skidded attacks) they are three-dimensional maneuvers rather than planar maneuvers.    In particular, it would be helpful for inexperienced readers to know that three-dimensional manuevers make one a more challenging target to hit versus someone using only two dimensional manuevers and that in the case of the spiral they help to prevent overshoots."

These instructional series are great for those who are patient, but I'm not patient with videos that utterly fail to include subtitles.  Even doing a full writeup doesn't help when you link the text of the maneuver's names to videos that fail to adequately explain the maneuver to someone who can't hear. Especially when there isn't any real textual data on said maneuvers themselves.  My advice? Condense this shit into something much more digestible.

E:D has the ""friendship drive"" which allows pilots to retain directional control at over 20 times the speed of light (going slower the closer you get to a gravity well), so it works out for that mode of gameplay.    SC has ""Quantum Drive"" which according to the lore only allows for 0.2 the speed of light with no variation in direction: straight lines only. While it would be cool to come out of Q drive and see a giant planet below, if the landing zone or station is on the other side of the planet it's going to be a looooong time before you get there at 200 m/s.    Of course this may become a pilot/navigation skill: you have to plan your approach to get as close to a landing zone window as possible, which may mean you have to jump past the planet, reverse (with a bit of an angle) course, then jump again to get to where you are going. This may or may not be fun."

starcitizen,3e3plk,Viajero1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:10 2015 UTC,One thing to note is that they don't have to actually make it 0.2c in game. Just like they are scaling the size of the systems they could also change the speed of the quantum drive in order to achieve that 10-20 minute time to cross a system.   Also I could be wrong here so feel free to correct me but I recall hearing it won't be completely restricted to just going straight.

It seems to be ""larger planets will fit in the double precision maps"", but that's such a ridiculous understatement as to be almost meaningless.  It's like pointing out that large vegetables can still fit inside someone's house.  Yes, a planet 237,697km in diameter or more is incomprehensibly large.  People simply cannot conceptualise something that big.  But so is a planet that's 12,227km in diameter.  Earth isn't ""large"" on a planetary scale, but it's still bigger than a person can comfortably think about.  Hell, I can't honestly conceptualise the size of the province I live in, let alone a planet. Keeping that in mind, the sizes of these planets is incomprehensibly small against the scale of how large the double precision maps can be.  A lowball estimate for how large the double precision maps can be is about 28AU wide, which is a large enough volume to hold 5.5x1013 Jupiters, if you just piled them all up.  That is a little bit more than the number of cells in the average adult body.  So if you're trying to point out just how big the maps are by talking about the large planets it can contain, you haven't come anywhere close to understand just how big these maps can be."

Humans are really insignificant creatures and playing in the immersive (everyone take a shot) universe should mean experiencing the oppressive mass of a planet nearby, not a styrofoam scale model of one.  I'm sure some game-y-nes can be conjured to get around hours of entry orbit adjustments. Maybe CIG will change the whole mechanics of the Q-drive at some point.

starcitizen,3e0qa0,Lazaretto,67,Tue Jul 21 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"The big takeaway for me is that they are building the FPS that is the core of the PU and AC 2.0.  They could have turned out a typical FPS using the Crysis assets but have chosen to ""do it right"" and more importantly ""do it once"" so that they have a faster development for the rest of the game and don't waste our investment money on something that isn't going to be used long term."

starcitizen,3e0qa0,LastImmortalMan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that the FPS was the basis of the game was of course well-known. The part about them not splitting development into a workable FPS just for the sake of releasing something sooner was I, think not, evident even to Chris Roberts until the last few months.  We could've had the FPS equivalent of arena commander released where we just had a few maps and generic gameplay that had no relevance to the final game.  We will still only get a few maps most likely but the core technology will be used throughout the final game."
starcitizen,3e0qa0,FlexoPXP,8,Tue Jul 21 18:07:11 2015 UTC,I keep thinking that Star Citizen as a project is a lot like a big-budget Dwarf Fortress with a multi-person development team.

starcitizen,3e0qa0,Houndai,14,Tue Jul 21 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"I really, really enjoyed 10 FtC today. It's clear that CR has not lost his way with how big the scope of SC has gotten, and that his heart along with the rest of CIG are still set on delivering us the best space sim/first person universe they possibly can.  As CR stated in this long 10 FtC, the journey means as much as the destination; this open development we're all taking part in and contributing to a PC game as big as SC might not be something many of us get to experience again to such an extent.  Let's remind ourselves that it's July 2015 now...and we're but a measly 3 months away from celebrating Star Citizen's 3-year anniversary. Just think; in less than the time that's already passed (hopefully by 2017!), we're all going to be enjoying the PU and all of the content we've been waiting so long for.

Some people are never going to be happy with Star Citizen, no matter what it accomplishes, and they're not even going to be receptive to anything besides new actual content releases.   If you look at those threads in /r/Games the most upvoted comments are negative ones.

starcitizen,3e0qa0,Getzageddon,6,Tue Jul 21 04:10:01 2015 UTC,"If you look at those threads in /r/Games[1] the most upvoted comments are negative ones.   Actually, if you look at the current comment thread about 10FTC, the top two comments are very positive, and further in the comments sections you can see lots of people giving logical defenses of SC. People appreciate the head of SC coming out and speaking frankly about the entire project, and that's reflected in the majority's positive opinion of this 10FTC.    I think I'm just going to stop doing it because I'm not going to change the minds of angry people who have formed an opinion based on no actual research.   Probably not, but those angry people are greatly outnumbered by mild skeptics even on /r/Games, and by reaching out to those skeptics and calmly discussing the facts of SC's development you can definitely change people's minds (as today's /r/Games thread has shown)."
starcitizen,3e0qa0,TROPtastic,3,Tue Jul 21 09:45:46 2015 UTC,"It may sound odd to say, but I actually consider myself a mild skeptic, despite the level to which I have backed.  Not because I don't think it can be done, but more because this is one of those things I feel like I have to see to believe.  I also wonder why there is this huge fear of feature creep when, realistically, they're putting stuff out in stages anyway, many of those features could very easily be tagged for being on the roadmap but maybe not in the moment everything is said to be 'live'.  It's not hard to imagine that they'd want some of these stretch goals to drive the evolution of the game as much as the core mechanics.  Either way, I fully support the development, and expect that they'll deliver a great game, but even now I'm not certain they'll deliver everything.  Even if they don't, however, I fully expect that the game will STILL be the best thing around, even at a third of what is promised."
starcitizen,3e0qa0,crazedhatter,31,Tue Jul 21 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"The reality is just that some people are... well... dicks. When A/C was delayed, they said Star Citizen was a vaporware scam. Star Marine gets delayed, they say vaporware scam, even though A/C is out. When Star Marine comes out, they'll say vaporware scam because SQ42 will get delayed. When SQ42 comes out, they'll say vaporware scam because the PU isn't out. When the PU gets delayed (realistically, these things are hard), they're gonna say vaporware scam until it gets released. When everything is out, and done, and people are rocking in the PU, they'll be nitpicking some animation glitch or rendering error. Some physics thing will cause your dude to jump three stories high in the hangar, and they'll pretend the whole game is broken forever because of it. Basically, they're drama queens who are committed to a ""side"" more than they're committed to reality."

Unfortunately a lot of folks in this day in age expect everything to be instant.  And I'm guilty of this thought form as well, although I have to calm myself and say ""it's all gonna work out in the end"".  So many people think making a game is quick and easy because they see a new call of duty come out once a year and an assassins creed game every year.  But the reality is games take time and many are in development for years before you even hear about them.  The difference is CR and CIG are starting from scratch with everyone and the media watching the whole thing from the very beginning.

At that time, the game wasn't really funded, it wasn't clear whether the VC guys were lined up, and I didn't really know if the game was going to be made, or if I had just pissed away a couple hundred bucks because they sent me a picture of a shiny golden ticket. A/C is kinda neat, but I'm not really a dogfighter, so the thing that really affirmed that I had made the right decision was the leak.  /my favorite part of the first Constellation sketches was that some artist felt the need to enumerate ""air tight"" as a feature of the docking collar.

For others, mostly those that have been around a bit longer and have experienced Chris's previous projects (e.g. Freelancer) are more sceptical, and can not run on blind faith alone.  Unfortunately, I fall into the second camp.  That's not to say I'm not excited for the game (if I wasn't I wouldn't be here), but it is to say that I need something more than just CR talking about what he wants to do, I want to see results, actual proof of concept.

CIG is an unproven development studio, and as you have stated, (and we all know) game development takes a long time.  I do not think any studio in the world has the ability to make the game Chris Roberts wants to make, and in addition to that I think CIG have chosen the wrong engine for the task.  Cry Engine was simply not built for a game of this magnitude, and I cannot see them being able to pull it off with the level of fidelity CR is shooting for.  I've seen it before with Freelancer, and we will likely see it again here.  Either way, I'm not bothered.  If they bring out a decent single player (preferably co op) space game, I'll be happy.  But I think a full on mmo with huge multi crew ships etc etc is not going to be possible without a huge injection of funding and time, and I think they were wrong to sell these giant ships/specific ship roles as concepts before those concepts were even proven."

starcitizen,3e0qa0,Davepen,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:45:32 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't.  I mean, they have some pretty assets, but nothing of what I've seen so far scream AAA game.   What's your computer science background?   I don't claim to be a game developer.  Do you need to have a computer science background to be allowed to be unimpressed by a game now? Get over yourself.  On paper, it's impressive.  But design ideas are not a game."
starcitizen,3e0qa0,Davepen,4,Tue Jul 21 09:40:34 2015 UTC,"I can't help you if you don't like the ship models, I think they're nice, you can disagree with the design aesthetic, but the texture and detail work is top notch.   Why I ask about your background, is because you don't know what stage they're at, what they're tackling and why its impressive that they're doing it the way they're doing it, like the damage state tech, the unified 1st-3rd person animation system, General Instance Manager tech, and ship power/signature/heat pipeline management. At every turn they avoid taking popular industry shortcuts, but that's not immediately apparent just from casually looking at a few screenshots."
starcitizen,3e0qa0,Getzageddon,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"I can't help you if you don't like the ship models   Where did you get that from?  I said that the one thing that I did find impressive was the assets....   the damage state tech, the unified 1st-3rd person animation system, General Instance Manager tech, and ship power/signature/heat pipeline management   But these things are not yet complete, they are attempting them, sure, but they are not yet working, mostly they are the reason why development is not progressing very quickly.  Like I said, on paper, it's impressive, but I've yet to see any evidence that they are able to pull it off.  Nothing about what we have seen so far is technically impressive."

starcitizen,3e0qa0,Journeyman_SC,3,Tue Jul 21 05:55:44 2015 UTC,"Probably correct, so it's a good thing some of us backed to enable the journey then.  I for one always avoided building a picture of what the game would ultimately be like in my mind, and I prefer to stay open for any possibility. As I see it, it's not about what we want, it's about helping CIG do whatever they want. At best we can inform them with our feedback and ideas, but ultimately it's their game to make. I pledged to see Chris Roberts and company unbound from the old  publishing/VC systems and that's exactly what I got. So I'm pretty happy with the way things are today (sure, not everything is nearly perfect or anything, but it is perfectly human), and excitedly look forward to the continued journey and eventual outcome of this wild cannon-ball ride.  I wish more people could understand that crowdfunding is not about us having developers create our dream game, it's about enabling them to realize theirs. Hopefully it'll all work out, maybe some of it won't; I say we should never pledge for the dream, we should pledge for the journey, with hope of the destination. We should pledge to finance, never to control.  Maybe the best would be to expect nothing but the ride, but always hope for the best at the end, and trust they'll do what they can to deliver on that. And we should adapt to that outcome. Whatever it turns out to be.  Edit: This was not so much directed towards anyone in particular. I just wish more people could try to appreciate what we have, and enjoy the present for what it is without worrying so much about the future and ""will it have this"", or ""it's broken if it doesn't have that"" and etcetera. Not saying we shouldn't still give feedback and share ideas, but I wish we could be more open and flexible when faced with change and the unexpected. Because sometimes change of plans are necessary when bringing a dream to life."

It's impossible to live up to the expectations of everyone. Not a lot of people have researched the game to the extent you and I have.

It's the road to disaster if they continue on as they have been IMNHO, and by disaster I mean either releasing a cobbled together POS or nothing finished at all, ever.  I'm also not very happy about their turning single player into a dopey mission based shooter that was originally sold IIRC as be an open trade, etc. i.e. privateer type of single player much as elite: dangerous did which I'm also not at all happy about.  Also wasn't very happy about their chintzy boxed product for that matter when I was expecting something much closer to the original Elite packaging.  So I guess I'm primed for disappointment already, although sad to say Star Citizen is looking like my only total KS backed project failure.  I'm a KS backer in the $100+ range."

starcitizen,3e3yol,Bribase,5,Tue Jul 21 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"Ben Lesnick (/u/banditloaf) just posted this in the controller katamari:   Hey guys! Just checking in to get your feedback on Chris' comments on 10 for the Chairman. What do we need to go into more detail about next time, what would help you guys feel more at ease with the long term plan?   I'd say the biggest issue with his comments are that CIG wants each controller to ""play to its strengths""  The issue I have with this is that zero order aim controls are so far superior to every other method, that it makes balancing that almost impossible.   what would help you guys feel more at ease with the long term plan?   Give us some indication as to how ""playing to the strengths of a controller"" is going to help joysticks vs mice in combat?  Since the mouse is clearly FAR better at aiming than the joystick, but the joystick is not really superior at all to the mouse for flight control, given that the mouse can easily switch modes to relative/vjoy and have all the functionality of a joystick.. How do you plan to balance the joysticks ""superior flight control"" with the mouse' superior aim control? This is nearly impossible when the mouse is 10x better at aiming, but the joystick is only 10% better at flying..  Another point: while the gimbal/weapon balance changes are fantastic for fixed vs gimbal gameplay, it doesn't address the imbalance between controllers when people want to use gimbals.  The mouse still has a massive advantage over a joystick user who wants to use gimbals, the current solution simply pigeonholes people into certain playstyles based on their controller choice."
starcitizen,3e3yol,scizotal,3,Tue Jul 21 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"Give us some indication as to how ""playing to the strengths of a controller"" is going to help joysticks vs mice in combat?   Wasn't that was the ""with a mouse you'll get more hits but the'll do less damage, with the joystick you'll get less hits but they'll do more damage"" part was?"
starcitizen,3e3yol,uGridstoLoad,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:50 2015 UTC,Yes if people are willing to accept being forced to use fixed weapons with a joystick and not enjoy the gimbal gameplay.  that's the pigeonholing I was taking about.
starcitizen,3e3yol,obscurehero,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"You don't I suppose. The joystick is significantly worse at aiming, and it won't ever be better than a mouse without drastic changes to how the game plays. The mouse won't ever feel as immersive or in-control as a joystick. I feel he means that by playing to the strengths you don't hinder either of them and more or less leave them as they are. The joystick is still far better in every scenario without aiming. Anything other than a 1v1 in a fighter with gimbals makes the joystick look great.  How would you plan balance the mouse vs joystick in a 1 player vs 1 player fight? Let's look at in reverse. How would you balance a mouse to be as good at general purpose flying as the joystick? I don't think anyone actually can. Some things are naturally going to be imbalanced, and perfect balance is impossible regardless."
starcitizen,3e3yol,Onikame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"Mice are already as good at general purpose flying as a joystick.  Mice are able to swap between interactive and relative mode with a press of a button, best of both worlds."
starcitizen,3e3yol,Leviatein,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"What's your solution?  You can't have those using a mouse unable to pilot small ships, and gimbals aren't really going anywhere.   You could add a reverse ESP that adds random small input near a target to approximate the joystick and make it worse at targeting, but there are very few features that make things worse in purpose that make any sense.  I think it's good that they gave their general philosophy, and I understand the exasperation. Otherwise, I think we'll just have to see how things go...  Very few fights in the PU are going to be single seat fighters going at it alone. There's some consolation in that."
starcitizen,3e3yol,Durkbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"My solution would be a way to negate the accuracy of mouse aimed gimbals, to bring it more into line with the accuracy of joystick aimed gimbals.  Since the mouse user aims his guns primarily by moving the gimbals (the gimbals are moving relative to the ship) and the joystick user is using gimbals to primarily offset his aim, but then tracks by moving the stick, my solution is adding spread to gimbals while they are moving so only reduce accuracy on gimbals that are actively moving relative to the platform.  This would reduce the accuracy of ""aim to fly"" mode, but not add difficulty to look ahead mode, or headtracking aim.  (Also please get rid of the terrible head-bob that affects gimbal aim)"

The Drake Dragonfly is way off, but it needs to have a space-Harley commercial. Other than that, I'd love to see a Khartu-al one by Aopopa, but it'd have to be really different from the others to show the cultural differences in the way the Xi'An would choose products.

Now that the MOCAP footage is finished they're going to be tied up with that - I reckon there might be another 1 or 2 between now and the end of the year - just because it will be a creative break from doing SQ 42 just something short and fun and possibly to run some experiments and get feedback about their techniques and mechanics without showing SQ 42 material.

starcitizen,3e32kn,Endyo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:12 2015 UTC,I think you're missing the point here.  The whole thing is about a commercial for a ship.  There's one showing off the military capabilities of the ship with the punchline that it was for an ice cream run.  There's one where there's a Cutlass pilot being a badass and it's all about this rebel girl pilot.  The commercial for the M50 is set to the tune of a Top Gear episode with a faux Jeremy Clarkson in it (an obvious parody).    It fits perfectly in line with all of those yet is centered entirely around the ship.  It's funny to the audience and entertaining to everyone.  Why are people so touchy about Derek Smart?  No one cares what he thinks and it's enjoyable to make fun of him.  Treating him like Voldemort isn't any better than laughing at his stupidity.
starcitizen,3e32kn,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point.   It's not treating him like Voldemort, it's treating him like someone throwing a tantrum to get their way.   You don't give them attention or any reaction at all.   Their tantrum must reward them nothing.   Not attention, not mockery, nothing.   They are beneath notice."
starcitizen,3e32kn,Endyo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know a human being on the planet beneath parody.  To each their own though.  The essence of parody is in and of itself to mock people for their ways even if they're petty and ridiculous.  I don't see a reason to go in circles about this though, it's just a funny thing that I thought of and I'm sure it would be a hit if they followed through with it as a nice little inside joke to the community."
starcitizen,3e32kn,DrInsano,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"While parody is protected, it could still raise enough of a stink that the headache might not be worth it. Better to just ignore the temptation to mock Smart and focus on a different idea for the commercial."

SC isnt really at a point where it can draw a lot of hype through anything new that's playable for us, and when it does release stuff that's actually worth mentioning it gets publicized pretty well.  Just relax and wait"

starcitizen,3e2bci,ukkie2000,9,Tue Jul 21 12:34:19 2015 UTC,Really there are 2 groups on /r/games when it comes to star citizen. And they avoid each other like the plague; There are 2 threads on /r/games about star citizen right now. The one linking to the video has a mostly positive comment section... The one that is just a copy-paste of a bit from the letter from the chairman is overwhelmingly negative.   It is very interesting to see that /r/games encourages discussion but opposing groups avoid actual discussion and just seek confirmation amongst themselves.
starcitizen,3e2bci,cavortingwebeasties,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"It gets old to be brigade'd after putting effort into a thoughtful comment. Keeps me from posting on several nooks of reddit, but gaming subs are generally the worst..."
starcitizen,3e2bci,katalliaan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the game, I find - games that appeal to smaller audiences tend to have better discussions partly because the people talking about it legitimately want to help each other and partly because they get to know each other. When you mix a bunch of games or have a game with a big audience, it becomes every man for himself.  So it's not a surprise that /r/games is a cesspit while smaller subreddits can have polar opposite views that are highly upvoted because they were well-expressed."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Edbergj,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:04 2015 UTC,I can see where he says the following seems sort of cultish.  I love what SC is and what it's going to become.  But I don't get angry at the nay-sayers.  I don't get aggravated at people's opinion if they disagree with me and my views on SC.  I trust that CIG will put out a great product in both SQ42 and the PU.  When the time comes to fall in love with the final product I hope to have the last laugh.    It does suck to see the vocal minority shoot holes in anything CIG tries to do.  I often feel like no matter what they try to do somebody has an issue with it or is trying to say CIG is ripping people off.    I hope I'm one of many silent backers that are content with waiting and are happy with how things are progressing.  I like the idea of REC because it allows people to play other ships that they may not want to spend their money on a virtual ship.  I found it silly that someone would find issue with that system.
starcitizen,3e2bci,cavortingwebeasties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"I've watched games turn into mediocre pos because the 'vocal minority' was ignored by the circlejerk of windowlickers and carebears that insulated the devs from reality, so be glad there is enough passion for people to care enough to bother voicing their opinions still because the apathy stage is a much worse indication of a project's health..."
starcitizen,3e2bci,RSOblivion,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"The vocal minority is one thing, but when you have some people like Derek ""please acknowledge I exist"" Smart whipping idiots into a frenzy over stuff that he got trolled on, it's not a helpful thing especially for all those people doing the work that Derek has failed to do over the last 20 years.  I agree there needs to be healthy discussion on issues, but there are always extremes on both sides who can usually be ignored due to their views not being based anywhere close to reality. It's just recognising who belongs to the extreme's and filtering out the bile as a result to make the feedback both positive and negative work to further the project."

starcitizen,3e2bci,magmasafe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:18 2015 UTC,I think it's also worth saying it's just a game. People shouldn't self identify with CIG (unless they're employees) or SC. There's no reason to take things personally.

Funny you mention that because exactly the same is happening in the Star Citizen forums: There's virtually zero room for constructive criticism. Anything that even smells like it gets downvoted into oblivion. Believe me, I've seen it happen many times.  So does this game suffer from haters? Yes it does. But on the other side of the unreasonable spectrum it definitely also suffers from blind fanboyism. Which I wouldn't classify as cultist btw."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Haftoof,3,Tue Jul 21 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between constructive criticism, then telling an entire Sub, it's fans, the backers, and the 500+ people working on the game that they are a cult.

starcitizen,3e2bci,Torifune,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"Derek Smart actually suffers from a secondary aspect of this cult of personality in that he's jealous and blind to reality in certain aspects, but he looks at the same people who ""worship"" Chris and is jealous of those aspects as well as Chris Roberts creations.  Chris is an intelligent man and though he has good and bad aspects I find all of this partially interesting but also kind of scary in its own aspects.     Who knows where all this will go, honestly I think a lot of people never learned to reflect and regulate their thoughts...  Chris is just a man, so is ben, so is sandy and everyone else.  They are capable of good, bad, failure, success and anything else you can think of.   So...   In a way, we could almost film this stuff and make a movie out of all of it as I look back on it all."

starcitizen,3e2bci,Haftoof,24,Tue Jul 21 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention the top poster because they post quite a bit on this sub-reddit and I have them RES tagged as Debbie Downer.  I consistently see him never being happy with any sort of news.  And you know what?  That's totally OK.  His post isn't wrong.  Most of what he says is true with a splash of opinion here and there.        So why do people who don't like the game or whatever consider a large amount of backers cultists?  Well, CR has talked a lot about his vision in what he sees SC becoming.  People want to see that vision come true.  A ""promise"" we should have ""faith"" in. People get hyped and spend money to back the game.  Now people aren't just emotionally invested but financially as well.  They don't want to feel like they're being suckered so they lash out and get very emotional over criticism.  It doesn't help that there's quite a bit of criticism being echoed based on misinformation ;)     One of the main reasons for all of this back and forth bickering is CIG's transparency model.  Had they not been so open about everything they've been working on, showing stuff off, and giving release windows, the development wouldn't seem so slow.  Since we're given practically daily updates it really drags things on.  Any hiccups such as bad network back end, remaking ship models, etc wouldn't even be a blip on the public's radar.  However, because the cogs of the machine are shown to the public, every mistake is highlighted and criticized.  It's a double-edged sword.  Not to mention other kickstarters promising a lot and failing miserably.  People have just been burned too many times.      In the end it will all boil down to whether the game will deliver remotely on what was promised.  Until then, you're going to have your lovers/haters."
starcitizen,3e2bci,decoyninja,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"A ""promise"" we should have ""faith"" in.   (30 minutes ago)   ""Lack of faith in a big undertaking such as this is precisely why we don't have a game like Star Citizen yet.""   (2 minutes ago)"
starcitizen,3e2bci,ionizzatore,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:02 2015 UTC,"Your point being?    Star Citizen is a direct result of a ""lack of faith"" among AAA publishers that a project as ambitious and risky as SC can be successful, or even possible.    The almost a million people who have pledged think - or rather believe without proof, thus have ""faith"" - that it is possible. That's pretty much the basis of all crowd-funded projects. You don't have something created yet, so you can't be sure the result will be what you expect, even that it will actually be built."
starcitizen,3e2bci,dykmoby,4,Tue Jul 21 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"You also have to remember that AAA publishers have a bottom line, that bottom line is the investors in the company.  I have stock in Activision Blizzard, they have their high-end game studios of Blizzard and their money makers (skylanders, call of duty, destiny, even WoW) and their high quality games (warcraft franchise, starcraft, diablo - it's doing better now) and new frenchises that are seeing lots of interest (heroes, hearthstone and overwatch).     What's important here to remember is that without the money makers driving the stock up and providing money into the business they can't follow through with new and unique ideas and spend time working on quality.   Even hearthstone is a new ideal for their group, low cost, high quality and fun and easy and their first major jump into more mobile low cost production genre.   Star citizen doesn't have this problem, their one job is to build star citizen, they have to manage their money and get the thing made, that's it.  Star citizen is actually more like a not for profit company as its initial push is going to probably produce little profit, where it gets interesting is when the company pulls in more profit from post production sales (people who get into star citizen after release or even the SQ42 franchise).   You are a backer not a traditional investor your investment out of this is what you get as a backer...  sadly as investments go that's candidly terrible, but you made the choice to pay it.     As a gamer, an artist (3d), and a guy who graduated with a business and computer security background there is a lot to the story of CIG that I find interesting, but I also see the ""cult"" like aspects.   CR has big shoes to fill, but the only people turning it into a cult is the cult itself, don't make CR a cult of personality...   Support the game but don't go overboard.  He is capable of faults, the company will have bumps, and life will move on."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well you could argue some early backers had ""faith"" on some level.  As time went on and evidence presented itself that this was going to happen, I don't think anyone pledging now it doing so on faith,  but evidence of what is coming. Evidence that is readily available.  That describes most of those 900,000 people. There had been more than enough evidence behind this game releasing with the proposed features being in development for a while now that to fall it ""faith"" is silly.   You can call it ""faith"" because it is currently unfinished if you want. But to me that is like going into a sandwich shop,  stopping next to someone watching the sandwich he just ordered being made,  and telling him he only has ""faith"" that he will get the sandwich.  Really it is evidence based on observation and previous experience."
starcitizen,3e2bci,T-Baaller,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"Your point being?   I'm at -1 at the moment, i don't think that people want to read it"
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,8,Tue Jul 21 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"In the spirit of constructive criticism, you are throwing out two quotes on ""faith"" but not elaborating on what the reader is supposed to gain from the quotes: there's no context given.     Are you trying to say that the two quotes are contradictory (which was how I interpreted it)? Re-enforce the ""cultish"" perception of SC backers/fans by highlighting terms common used in religious context?"
starcitizen,3e2bci,samfreez,18,Tue Jul 21 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"By your own admission, you are new here. For those of us that have been around since 2012 there is definitely a sub group of backers that exhibit cult like behaviour.  I say that, not only as an original backer who has watched the Church of Christ Roberts flourish these past years, but because I used to be heavily involved in a cult.  The fact that you consider JW's a cult pretty much says it all. They are like the kiddy pool of cults, if they can even be considered one these days. They aren't really any different than other mainstream organized religions, and I at least respect that they get off their couches and actually try and do something for their faith.  But this isn't the place for religious debates. One thing you are right about is that SC isn't exclusive with having a cult-like fan base.  However, the unique nature of SC's astounding crowdfunding success combined with CR's charismatic personality and legendary dev status... makes for a perfect storm of cult like behaviour, especially here and on the official forums.  That scares a lot of people.  Now are we all like this? Of course not. But it definitely exists and it's been out in full force recently."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,8,Tue Jul 21 12:53:28 2015 UTC,Don't forget that this game has allowed people to invest far more than other games with a cult following.  It's almost scary to imagine who would spend thousands on a single game
starcitizen,3e2bci,samfreez,7,Tue Jul 21 13:13:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I spent thousands, but I now realize that it was a mistake. I'm fine with keeping my basic pledge, but I'm looking at either getting a refund or just selling the rest at cost.  It's just not worth it."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:10 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt you'll get a refund for willingly giving them money with the understanding you were funding development.  If you're flat broke and can no longer make rent due to life events, you can definitely talk to them, as they have said before they're willing to work with people under hardship.. but if you're just not willing to sit through the development time, you're better off just selling your extra stuff at cost and moving on.  How's it not worth it though?  You gave them thousands of dollars to make the game happen.  Without your pledge, and those of all the rest of us, this game wouldn't be anywhere near what we're hoping it'll be."
starcitizen,3e2bci,samfreez,4,Tue Jul 21 15:46:46 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons why I, personally, have gone from one of CIG's biggest fans (look at my reddit handle) to a more objective and critical backer.  That's not to say that I've given up.  Trust me, I want Star Citizen to succeed.  I want the game that was pitched to me in 2012 (which is part of the problem actually).  If they manage to pull it off I will gladly give the game a go.  I have a signed collector's edition Rear Admiral package with a Phoenix upgrade that's worth hundreds of dollars.  I could get over $600 for it on the grey market.  But I will never ask for a refund for it, or sell it.  I'm supportive of the game that Chris Roberts wants to make and I'll stick by my original pledge.  However, I am no longer 100% convinced that they will be able to pull off the game they are now describing.  This isn't a conclusion I came to suddenly.  It's developed very slowly over the past couple of years.  One thing added to another before I realized that I didn't like the direction things are headed.  I won't go into details here.  I have done so a number of times and I don't want to de-rail this conversation.  Could I be wrong?  Absolutely.  They could pull off something no one else ever has.  And like I said, I'm willing to stand by the hundreds of dollars I initially pledged to this idea.  But I've also grown as an individual in these past few years.  Part of that is realizing that the additional thousands of dollars I've given CIG would be put to much better use elsewhere in my life.  Also, I recognize that I let the hype and the ""dream"" influence me emotionally and even irrationally.  Even the largest supporters of the game admit that donating thousands upon thousands of dollars for imaginary internet spaceships in a game that's not even close to being completed is not very rational.  Even CIG and Chris Roberts tell us time and time again that these ships will be available in-game.  That buying ships now won't give anyone an unfair advantage in the game.  LTI is ""worthless"".  Ship sales are meant to support development and someone who only gives $30 for a basic package will have the same game and ships as someone who spent 10k+ on every ship in the 'verse.  So I've committed to lessening my emotional and financial investment in this game.  I'll keep my collector's edition Rear Admiral package.  I'll also keep all the various cosmetic items I've bought and the 30+ months of imperator subscription I've paid for.  But that's it for me.  Once I've liquidated the majority of my hangar I'll step back and focus on much more important things.  If Star Citizen comes out and is actually what we were promised and then some... great!  I'll gladly give it a go and even give credit where it is due.   But until then I'll leave them to their work.  If they fail, or release something that upsets most of the backers, then I'll still have lost out on my pledge (which is many times more than I have ever paid for a video game).  I just can't justify risking thousands and thousands of dollars anymore.  They have more than enough money to make the game they promised in 2012.  However, Chris Roberts fully admits that he's increased the scope to match the crowdfunding.  It's still yet to be determined if they will be able to create a game anywhere close to what people are hoping it will be.  For me, I pledged for what Chris pitched in 2012.  What we have today is a different game than that.  I don't agree with all of it, nor have they released anything yet that has convinced me they can pull it off.  Therefore I personally can't continue to support them because they are no longer making the game that I pledged for.  I'm not completely withdrawing my financial support, but I believe it's more than fair to lessen my financial risk, all things considered.  Obvious Disclaimer: This is all my personal opinion and deals with my specific circumstances.  I'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to seek refunds or reduce their financial risk.  Everyone is free to spend their own money as they see fit, just as I am.  I would never judge anyone else for that, just as I don't like anyone trying to tell me what to do with my money."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, I applaud you for a concise and well thought out reply.    I would like to stress, however, that what they'd been focusing on (GIM, etc as well as the 64-bit conversion) are all invisible, intangible changes, but will lead to far better experiences.  We're now seeing the fruits of all their labor, in the form of increased capacity, quicker load times, and far, FAR larger areas, thanks to the 64-bit conversion.  I strongly suspect Gamescom will be a make/break for a lot of people, but if CIG comes through with what they're claiming they have nearly ready to go, I bet it'll be far more of the make, and far less of the break.  For now, I would urge caution.  Wait until Gamescom and see what comes of that.  If you still aren't satisfied, then carry on with your plan to sell off assets etc.  The original game in 2012 is essentially what we have now... but knowing they decided to abandon the tiny scope and move to a far larger one fills me, personally, with a whole ton of hope.  It's a massive, time consuming project, and they're forging new ground in areas very few people actually understand.  As a result, it's slow for now, but building the framework (which sounds like it's nearly complete now) is a major part of what'll make this game great.  It's just hard to SEE any of that until they release the modules that'll let us actually experience the effects of the changes they've made."
starcitizen,3e2bci,warm_vanilla_sugar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, I applaud you for a concise and well thought out reply.   Thank you!  I appreciate that. :)   I would like to stress, however, that what they'd been focusing on (GIM, etc as well as the 64-bit conversion) are all invisible, intangible changes, but will lead to far better experiences.   That's the hope, yes.  But part of my problem is that it's all talk right now.  If you look back to when the dogfighting module was delayed, there was a lot of similar discussion, of which I participated and fully defended CIG much like others are now.  Unfortunately we have yet to properly experience a lot of the advancements that they discussed, even a year and a half ago.  That's why some of us are losing some patience with talk and want to see some more tangibles.   We're now seeing the fruits of all their labor, in the form of increased capacity, quicker load times, and far, FAR larger areas, thanks to the 64-bit conversion.   This is something I don't really agree with.  We aren't seeing the fruits yet.  We hear about them, but even with the latest 1.15 patch on the PTU we are missing a LOT of pieces.  They talk about these things coming to us as soon as Gamescom, but that's dangerous because if they can't deliver... well, let's just say that I think they are setting themselves up for failure.  If the next month really brings us good tangibles that show off everything they say they've been working on behind the scenes, then I will gladly eat crow.  But I think it would have been much wiser to surprise us with releases rather than hype up the game even further after all the recent criticism.   I strongly suspect Gamescom will be a make/break for a lot of people   You are absolutely right.  Unfortunately, in response to criticism, Chris Roberts has basically promised the moon in the next month.  I sincerely hope that they pull it off, but the potential fall-out if they can't make their deadline is astronomical at this point, no matter what excuses they give.  This is the same situation that they've found themselves in since the beginning, and they don't seem to learn.  Increasing the hype even more at this point, through more talk and promised deadlines, is not doing them any favours.   For now, I would urge caution. Wait until Gamescom and see what comes of that. If you still aren't satisfied, then carry on with your plan to sell off assets etc.   I was already cautious months ago, and by now I've already made my decision to lessen my financial risk.  It's not just about what they can deliver.  It's about other decisions they've made which won't change, like their focus on concept ship sales and how they have handled testing and REC.  I've never agreed with the VD store, and I know for a fact that they will try to monetize Star Marine the same way (they've confirmed it multiple times).  I also don't agree with some design decisions that have changed since the campaign began, like the shift from a Wing Commander style flight model to something more similar to Freelancer.  I could go on and on, really.  I'm not trying to convince anyone else and it's just my personal opinion.   The original game in 2012 is essentially what we have now   I can't agree with this.  The hangar and Arena Commander aren't even close to the original pitch.   but knowing they decided to abandon the tiny scope and move to a far larger one fills me, personally, with a whole ton of hope   The original scope was anything but tiny.  It was ridiculously ambitious from the start.  Which is why I personally am not filled with hope.  Even the original pitch would have been difficult to pull off with the estimated 23 million he was originally looking for.  What we have now is many times larger than that.  Will 85 - 100 million be enough?  I honestly hope so, because Chris Roberts is now talking about building a game with such unprecedented fidelity that it makes a sandbox fan like myself squeal with delight!  But there are some basic fundamentals of their concept which they still haven't proven are possible.  Maybe they will provide proof of concept within the next month.  If so, that will be a big win for them.  But their track record hasn't been great and I'd rather be cautious at this point than hopeful.  Again, YMMV.    It's a massive, time consuming project   This we can totally agree on. :)   It's just hard to SEE any of that until they release the modules that'll let us actually experience the effects of the changes they've made.   Exactly.  I look forward to the day when we can see the progress they are making.  But even if they were to suddenly come out with a Persistent Universe Alpha tomorrow which proved that they can have gigantic instances with a hundred players in multi-crew ships using localized physics grids... I would still cut back on my investment because, at the end of the day, this is just a game and I realize that I sunk far too much money into it.  I'll stand by my hundreds of dollars, which I think is perfectly reasonable, but I made a personal mistake in donating thousands of dollars and thankfully there are ways to rectify that.  I completely own my mistake.  CIG or Chris Roberts didn't force me to donate all that money.  And if there wasn't any other recourse I would absolutely take responsibility for the money that I lost.  But thankfully that's not the case. :)  I sincerely wish CIG the best, but it's time for me to take a step back.  Whatever happens happens.  I believe I've done my part and it will be interesting to see where things end up in a few years."
starcitizen,3e2bci,samfreez,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Given how painfully aware CR is of the need to reign in his own enthusiasm, I don't think he'd be hyping things at this point if there were any real risk of Gamescom being a bust.  Based on the writing on the walls, and what we have in fact now seen (somewhat) with 1.1.5, I'm confident the back end changes are well on their way to being fully functional.  The improved area size of the map, as well as the increase in the number of ships etc bodes rather well, especially since it's a step between where they were, and where they want to be.  It's really hard to see a lot of the stuff they've been talking about, because it's all back-end ""how the universe works"" kind of stuff, and not flashy graphical stuff people generally consider to be progress.  For me, listening to and reading every article I can, I'm able to see that what they're doing, despite not being visible right now, is in fact MASSIVE progress.  Overhauling the CryEngine to 64-bit is no tiny task by any means, and signifies a massive boost in functionality once they add more stuff."

You are right, and I have no doubt that they are working their asses off.  I hate it when people talk about SC like it's a scam, because we know for a fact that hundreds of people are working like crazy on this ambitious game.  But at the end of the day... for me personally... I can't justify backing this game to the tune of 14k+.  $500-$1000 maybe, and I think that's more than supportive.  But unfortunately I was caught up in all the hype about what this game could be and made a poor financial decision, even if it wasn't rent money and something I could easily afford.  And like I said... even if you are right and they do come out with a ton of stuff in the next month... there are still other aspects of development and funding that I completely disagree with.  For most of these things CIG has been quite adamant about not changing.  Therefore I can't in good conscience continue to support them financially more than I already have.  I'll stick to my original pledge (with added Phoenix upgrade!), but that's where I draw the line.  I think that's a fair compromise."

My own total is far, far smaller. Even then, I've downsized the fleet because I want this to be a fun project to follow, not an exercise in cognitive dissonance. I have a certain amount in the game, and I work within it by melting and rearranging what I have. My real-life obligations both to myself and others just don't allow me to put more in (as much as I might want x ship right now! lol).  While I doubt they will do a refund, if your ships are tradable, I suspect you will make some folks very, very happy over in /r/Starcitizen_trades - especially if you do end up liquidating at cost or below the current rates just to make it quick/easy.  Anyway, regardless of your feelings on whether this game will turn out or not, I just wanted to let you know someone on the internet empathizes with your situation."

As of right now, I'm only in it for $90 or so, which is still WAY more than I'd ever actually pay for a game normally... but at least right now, I only have 2 ships in my fleet lol  (Reliant and Aurora).  Don't lose hope, friend.    We're all in this to see the dream come true.  It's always a royal pain to have to wait, but I strongly suspect we'll all be fapping into our Wheaties once gamescom comes (hah!) and goes, as we'll have plenty to look at or do.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if FPS/Star Marine launches on the final day of Gamescom.  It sounds like that's the plan so far, at least."

Don't worry too much about the hype.  It's just a quick way to freak yourself out.  If you need proof, look at CR's eyes when he speaks to the camera.  There's a burning passion in there, and that's what keeps me going.  This is his life's ultimate accomplishment, and for that reason alone, I have faith.  When the game goes live, or when PU etc is available, we should fly together.    I'll show you my ships if you show me yours ;) lmao"

What features specifically do you have issue with and don't want in the game?   I can see having regret over spending all that money, as in, maybe that was not such a wise financial decision. (I'm an original Aurora level backer and perfectly happy to earn everything in game). But is anything, if I had spent much more, I'd see all the stretch goals and various additions as getting more value for my pledge dollars. Aside from the argument over whether or not they can make it all work, which is pointless to argue about imho, would you really rather have a chopped down, much less cool game now rather than waiting for something truly special? Like if I'm hearing you right you'd rather have received a lesser game sooner AND you'd be happy to pay MORE for it. Doesn't make sense to me, but hey, that's your take."

I say that, not only as an original backer who has watched the Church of Christ Roberts flourish these past years, but because I used to be heavily involved in a cult.   UNBELIEVER! /jk  Actually, its fun to preach of ""Our savior Christ Roberts"", cause there are people who are the other way around, they love to laugh at every positive note, and cant leave even one good thing on SC, gleefully dissecting every delay, and spinning their scam theories.   I am not a cultist but so far, i can say i trust Roberts.. im also not in a haste TO PLAY NAO, i dont need instant gratification, i rather want the game done right. So.. i see it very very relaxed."

Watch and listen and you'll see what people are referring to. It's rather creepy.  :(  Of course it's not everyone. It's not even the majority. But there is definitely a cult-like presence here and on the official forums. It's just that right now they are in full attack mode, so it's hard to have any kind of discussion without being mass down voted and attacked.

What really fucking annoys me is the fact that anyone who doesn't criticise is immediately called a cultist. Sorry, but that's just downright fucking bullshit and I am flatout sick of it. If people are gonna have such an issue woth positivity they can join a hate group (I'm sure there's plenty for Star Citizen) and leave us to remain optimistic about this project.   I suppose that's creepy right? And by the way, the community forced itself to polarize into the people that wanna whine about the delays and the people who are still reasonably patient."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:07 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with being positive.  I like positive people.  That's not what people are referring to when they talk about cultish fans.  I even said that the cultish backers aren't even a majority.  But unfortunately they are loud and respond to any sort of criticism with massive downvotes and name calling, no matter how well written or informed the criticism may be.  But replies (when they actually DO reply and don't just downvote) essentially come down to a couple of responses:  ""Fuck you!  GTFO if you don't like Star Citizen, asshole!""  ...or the nicer version....  ""You don't know what you are talking about.  Chris knows what he is doing, have faith.""  What is scary is how many people respond to criticism with phrases like ""just have faith"" or ""I believe in Chris Roberts.""  More often than not these calls for faith and belief are their only retort.  Sometimes I have a discussion with someone who is more informed, and I've even listened to people and admitted I was wrong when someone had a good argument backed up with facts.  But for anyone with any experience with cults, hearing all this talk about ""faith"", ""belief"", and the all mighty ""vision"" and ""dream"" should cause warning bells to go off.  I know, because I was there myself not that long ago.  Thankfully I eventually recognized how irrational I was being and started to better re-orient my thinking.  Things get even worse once you start noticing a ""circling of the wagons"" (which is in full force right now here, and in the official forums).  Also, there is a lot of talk (even from high up in CIG) warning backers not to listen to ""outsiders"".  This is not healthy.  Again, not everyone is like this.  We have almost a million backers, many of whom gave their initial pledge and are content to wait for whatever happens.  But you can't deny that there is a group of vocal backers who exhibit cult-like behavior.  Unfortunately with Star Citizen, this is amplified even further because of the unique circumstances of the successful crowdfunding campaign and because people have given a LOT of money to this project.  Not to mention that Chris Roberts is undeniably charismatic."

I very nearly gave up on this place after the 42nd DS post because if this sub can't steer itself away from being full of one guy's opinions (being reprinted/regurgitated by his neophytes) it clearly isn't a place for intelligent discussions.

starcitizen,3e2bci,Torifune,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"Most people aren't privy nor aware of the complexities of game development or any sort of development.       Pay them no heed, I've been a backer since 2012 and I've simply been ignoring most remarks and answering anyone who is genuinely curious.      The thing is, most gamers expect games to be done within... a span of about 2 years. There's a reason for this, many games share similarities such as engine, textures and other assets meaning a ""new"" game can be made easily e.g. Call of Battlefield: Dog Zombies 4, or your yearly sports title, these games can essentially be copy and pasted (relatively speaking) and thus churned out yearly across multiple platforms this means more yearly sales with minimal work which publishers like cause it means more money.      An example would be automobile development, you can share a platform across models even across brands, you can reuse the same engine for different models or years of models, the same thing is done for games essentially.      The occasional AAA title that is done from scratch (relatively speaking again) would have some work done across the spectrum and then they'd announce the game in the form of a teaser or trailer at an event like E3. Star Citizen on the other hand with their modular release differentiates in that their work is focused on specific parts of a game (e.g. Arena Commander and Star Marine), this results in issues in development seeming far larger than they actually are like with the Star Marine delay. And when one takes in to account the sheer scope and ambition of the project the work seems to the uninitiated a drop in the proverbial bucket when in fact development is more exponential than it is nonexponential.      And in the case of SC certain irregular factors have to be taken into account.       There is no clear deadline. ""accountable"" to it's players rather than investors or a publisher. has to setup EVERYTHING from scratch as they are a new studio. is adding the following amongst a multitude of other things into CryEngine space flight/combat, zero-g FPS, dynamic damage and controls to ships,  MMO-esque netcode, MANY MANY times more polygons than other console OR PC games, PBR rendering and etc. etc. compared to what other studios do CIG might as well be carving Mount Rushmore with a spork.   Additionally most games in development that have reached SC's current level of progress would slap together a small trailer or playable E3/Gamescom demo and be all like LOOKIE WHAT WE GOT followed by COMING IN 2017 which would then be followed by cheers, jubilation and hype as there would have been very little to zero information prior BUT SC is different in that it has been cluing us in to pretty much most if not all significant progress updates from day 1 which makes it seem like development has been at a stand still with little progress. CIG also doesn't do the exclusive info thing most AAA games do with the gaming media, so as a result editors tend to bash SC in that regard when possible either do to personal/professional dislike or to generate clickbait articles, and to most of the ""major"" gaming media outlets PC is a nearly irrelevant platform all of which adds to the flak and influences the easily influenced.      The people who are profoundly negative, I would say... primarily are those who have not been keeping track, any information they receive are from the aforementioned ""gaming press"" as well as other negative misinformed internet users which then would influence their view on the game and in turn they spew misinformation and negative outlooks on the game repeating the cycle. They could also be negative console players jealous that their consoles won't be receiving a port or what have you.      But really don't bother with them, you know how some games have seemingly nothing but toxic players who are jealous of every little thing and irate at every tiny thing that doesn't go exactly their way; imagine if those people are somewhere online outside of their video games... yeah that's what you're dealing with."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Davepen,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"So, as the poster of that comment I feel like you kind of misinterpreted my post, and took my description of some portions of hardcore SC fandom as being ""cultish"" a bit too literally, since they obviously aren't real cultists.   You are going to tell me I am in a cult? Give me a fucking break., I was a Jehovah's Witness for years, and quit out of that religion many many years ago. I KNOW what a cult is. This is no where near a cult. It's insulting and downright grasping at straws to prove an argument.   No, I'm not going to tell you you're in a cult. I never said that anybody was in a cult, I simply said that there is a ""cultish"" (emphasis on the -ish) flavor to a lot of the rhetoric that both CIG and fans put out. Was that meant as a broad generalization to describe all rhetoric, and all fans? Absolutely not. Anyway, enough of that, you're ignoring the entire rest of my post. My description of the ""cultish fanatical fanbase"" was not used to prove an argument. I simply said that dealing with such extreme fanboyism gets exhausting, and again, you can describe people as ""cultish"" without stating that they are actually ""cultists""   That has to be the most immature, most grandiose, idiotic, naive, and down right paranoid statement I have ever read on a discussion forums before.   Is it though? How else would you describe all the hero worship that goes on, or some of the extreme fanboy rhetoric that gets spouted about us needing to have ""faith"" in the ""dream"" etc etc.? It's an adjective, I don't see what's paranoid about it since I never claimed that there is some secret SC cult working in the shadows.    I feel like these people are the same people that complain when a game is rushed out the door and is shit on release. I feel like this generation of gamers in general, is used to shit maybe? Or maybe this generation of PEOPLE, are just used to instant gratification and games are made by magic?   You're right, I do complain when a game is rushed out the door. If you read my post, I said that I really have no problem with delays themselves, but it's all the other surrounding headaches associated with the game that get exhausting and contribute to skepticism.   This REALLY struck a nerve for me because being on Reddit for awhile, and following SC, and other released games. Look at the ridiculous ""cult"" following for Fallout 4. There are probably millions of people who have pre-ordered.   Fallout 4 isn't really a ""cult"" game, since a ""cult following"" is typically used to describe a relatively small, but passionate fanbase, whereas Fallout is highly mainstream at this point. Regardless, that usage is completely different than describing some extreme fanboys as ""cultish"" or describing actual ""cultists."" So I don't see what that has to do with anything.  I mean, I don't know what to say. I wasn't trying to offend anybody or even talk shit about SC. I was mostly just explaining a lot of people are ""doubters"" or otherwise skeptical about the game, and why that paragraph from the Letter is something that I don't find helpful. Does CIG explain other things elsewhere in a helpful way? Certainly, but I find things like that paragraph to be so unnecessarily preachy and dramatic, and not really anything that's going to dispel people's notions about the game. I don't think the game is vaporware, or a scam, or any other really extreme view for that matter. But I do think that CIG has done things that justify some skepticism.  I've posted in this subreddit for awhile now, and even though the bulk of my posts make me come across as a bit of a Debbie Downer, my opinion of the game or its community isn't overwhelmingly negative like you seem to think it is. It's still my most anticipated game, I like plenty of what they're doing, but I do feel that it's important to acknowledge things that can be improved upon. And since in general the SC community does a wonderful job at writing positive opinions of the game, I suppose I naturally gravitate towards providing a more critical counter-view, which is why I posted that in the thread, since at the time the top comment was very positive about the project."

starcitizen,3e2bci,CitizenKhaelis,9,Tue Jul 21 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"Reading that top comment, there is absolutely noting un-factual about it.  It's all true information.  Conversely, if someone were to post that in /r/starcitizen, it would get down voted into oblivion.  From an outsider's point of view, some of the decisions CIG have made during development so far have been questionable at best, down right mind boggling at worst.  This sub berates companies like EA for DLC and sub standard products, but praises CIG even though they do many of the same things wrong.  Chris Roberts himself compared Star Citizen to World of Tanks, they have monthly (within 5 days, the only deadlines they keep) concept sales for hundreds and hundreds of dollars for ships and gameplay that does not exist (even though they have far exceeded their funding goals), and they implement freemium rental currencies and online credit/component stores for something that is supposed to be an alpha test bed.  If you can't see why some people may be a bit perturbed by that, maybe it says more about you (and a lot of this sub) than it does about the rest of the gaming community.  Also, I don't see how you can compare it to the interest in Fallout 4, as it's a totally different development model and funding system.  If Bethesda were selling us parts of Fallout 4 for hundreds/thousands of dollars months/years before the game was released, it would raise the same questions."
starcitizen,3e2bci,BoboMatrix,4,Tue Jul 21 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"Selling the promise of future ships in an open sandbox MMO to expand the scope of the game is  totally legit, and probably the way I would have done it if I were CR. I don't see the problem at all.. and I question the vision and intelligence of those that don't agree for I have yet to see a reasonable counter argument/narrative as to how we would get that money to expand any other way. The game wasn't funded at 20 mill.. It will still not be funded at 100mill. It's not a finite amount.. The difference of perception is right here.."

starcitizen,3e2bci,Autoxidation,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:17 2015 UTC,The way I understand the freemium stuff and Arena Commander is its like a mini-game like all other minigames and is to be treated as such inside the SC universe.. Like going to an arcade center.. Kinda like World of Tanks is to us.. I'm not worried it will mean too much in the PU.. But I see your concern if you don't view the AC like a game within the game
starcitizen,3e2bci,dalt0nfury,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"But AC is the game we have at the moment.  It's supposed to be the test bed for the dogfighting/flight mechanics that will be part of the PU/SQ42.  I think them monetising it was the wrong choice, and it makes me wonder how they are going to handle Star Marine, as I'm assuming that will also make heavy use of REC / online purchases for weapons etc.  Also, reading CR's latest update it sounds like the initial plan was just to create Arena Commander for sale, and then created SQ42 as the single player component, which would explain the REC videos talking about how ""it was the plan all along"".  When funding exploded, they should have changed their original plans for Arena Commander, and changed it from a pay to play arena combat game designed to drum up funds into the alpha test bed that it has become."
starcitizen,3e2bci,NotScrollsApparently,6,Tue Jul 21 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"Well, only 10 percent of people create things while the 90 percent complain about it. Its unlikely for most people to believe it's a game until it's actually released. This is the burden of innovation. If you go back to look at every single innovation in any field you'll find the majority of people to be naysayers. I distinctively remember the cynicism for the iPhones release. We are early adopters, we are the few and they are the many. There's no need to fight them, they'll bandwagon eventually and will tell people how they believed in this project all along.

People think they know what they want, but so much of it winds up contradictory. People want instant gratification, so they want stuff now but rushing things winds up getting you a sub-par product. People play games for challenge and entertainment yet cheat to make the game trivial and then complain that it's boring. People want to feel validated and be right so they complain about things around people who share a similar position/opinion, and any time someone offers a conflicting point of view it's shot down, often not on any merits of the argument but based on it simply being something other than what they want to believe.    The world is thus full of impatient, ignorant, immature, and insecure people stuck in an echo chamber of their own beliefs and unwilling to take the time to remedy any of that for even a brief glimpse of a much larger world."

starcitizen,3e2bci,Thirdstar_81,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"/u/hia447 makes some good constructive posts in this subreddit. Anyone who has followed Star Citizen for an extended period of time can easily share his views.   Selling ships doesn't bother me that much, it's something they had to do in order to get the game funded. The weird freemium-esque style of Arena Commander really bothers me though.  That being said, I don't think Star Citizen is anything close to resembling vaporware and I still am anxiously awaiting the release of both the FPS and multi-crew ships. I can wait, delays are no big deal to me. He definitely has a point on the somewhat cultish nature of some of Star Citizen's backers though. There are too many people, especially on the forums, that are unable to look critically at CIG, for better or for worse."

starcitizen,3e2bci,Walltar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:18 2015 UTC,"This post and the top comment make me want to scream. BUt it's pointless. The minute I comment or say something, I'll be downvoted and my post into oblivion.   I won't downvote you. However, I don't see anything factually wrong with that top post. It's obviously written by a SC backer, one that's been following SC development for some time now. It's objective in my mind and very well explains why are some people disappointed with SC's development. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean other people don't feel that way, and they have the right to express their feelings just like you do right now.  In short, I do think this community acts like a cult sometimes. CIG gets away with tons of stuff for which some other devs would be crucified, and it's not like you can say it's justified considering their delays/working features record.   I do believe it will be a good game someday. I do believe it will be finished. But I WILL NOT, absolutely NOT apologize on their behalf for mistakes they keep doing. I will not try to justify them adding stuff like cocktail mixing minigames, pet breeding, having constant concept sales while they haven't even finished half of the ""already sold out"" ships or compromising gameplay under the guise of ""immersion and fidelity"". I will call them out on bullshit like that every single time, regardless of downvotes or namecalling that happens to those who go against the hivemind.   The fact that CR came back and wrote a nice letter repeating the same thing he's been saying for the past year doesn't change my mind. Only seeing some factual evidence, some actual progress, will change my mind. And when that happens, I'll be the happiest person on this subreddit."

There was absolutely nothing wrong with anything he wrote and he brought up a number of legitimate criticisms.   Criticism is not a bad thing, and he did not word his post aggressively or rudely in any way. He also did not call CIG or SC a cult, he said some among their supporters have expressed a cultish fanatical behaviour and he is not wrong there either.  RELAX. That's about all there is to say about that. Frankly your post here strikes me as way more unreasonable and ranty than his response did.    The problem is since /r/games[4] is the forefront of Reddits major news network for gaming, people are going to think this is what Star Citizen is like, and what they say holds to the community and the developers working on it.   You aren't Star Citizen's PR department. They've already said that they have more than enough money at this point in time to make the game they want to make. Obviously more money is good but at this stage they don't need it. Who gives a fuck what other people think about Star Citizen. The game will speak for itself, if it gets released and is a pile of dogshit then they'll have been right all along, conversely if it gets released to critical praise and 80-90s across the board watch how quickly people change their tune."

And it only looks slightly better than Planetside 1 which came out in 2003 so why play that when there's Planetside 2, Tribes: Ascend, or Firefall just look at the Steam ratings for a rough indication.      Also out of all their (3000AD) games on Steam there is only 1 positive item and it's a DLC with 2 reviews. http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=3000AD      Smart has what? 16 games under his belt the most famous and highly rated of which was supposedly released against his will.         Chris Roberts has the Wing Commander series, the Freelancer, Starlancer, Conquest as well as having been part of the venerated Origin Systems, founded Digital Anvil which was eventually bought out by Microsoft. If we're talking about accolades, reputation, quality of games as well as their general reception by gamers and the gaming media CR wins on all fronts, glancing their Wikipedia articles alone should support my statement.

It's said that a Constellation will take a week to get, and it's anyones guess if they mean 40 hours or 20 hours of play time in that estimate.  So for my $275 spent on the game, you can earn that same ship with minimal play time and no money.  Usually I call something P2W when the items aren't obtainable any other way than to pay real cash. In the end, it's really all about the lesser of 2 evils, do we put up with the borderline P2W (which will be a non-issue several months into the PU after people start earning those ships in game) or should we rather say no and let the game not be made, because without our pledges there is no funding and the game will not be made."

starcitizen,3e2bci,Davepen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"That's simply the last angle of attack used to dismiss anyone making a rational point supportive of SC. /r/games seems to be content to be a pool of negativity, waiting for a new downgrade uproar or the next game to hate. There are a lot of good things to read daily in that sub but the overwhelming negativity and ignorance kinda outweighs it.  I also don't think they are representative of how welcoming and hopeful the wider gaming community can be.  But really, it's no wonder we've seen such strong reactions from them when confronted with concepts like optimism or vision. For some reason, this is infuriating to them. The merits of technical arguments are off-handedly dismissed with lines like ""I'm not a gamedev but I'll believe it when I see it"". They aren't interested in how to help make great games happen again. They only seem interested in cynical vindication because they have been burned so many times in the past.   But at the end of the day, this is a part of a community that mocks people because they dare to hope and have a vision. No innovation, no great work or improvements would ever happen if makers listened to these kind of armchair generals. Like someone else put it eloquently a while ago, the issue is that cynicism is what passes for intelligence."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Citizen4Life,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"When it comes to people selling you stuff, their talking of grand visions and innovation should always make you skeptical, see Molyneux.

Especially when you'll find other topics on the first page raging against the very industry trends that SC is trying to break. Understand software development, understand delays, be supportive of people trying to break new ground. And by that I mean, don't stir up needless drama just because it's a slow news day.  Regarding your point about visions and innovation, I'd think you'd at least take the time to listen and consider the technical merit of what he's saying before dismissing him. A moonshot is attempted because it has a realistic basis in the current state of the art. Molyneux had no idea of how to achieve his vision and he never showed anything conclusive. You can't make that point about SC if you have even remotely followed development.  And that's the problem with r/games. They have no idea what they are talking about."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Davepen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"You made a general comment about optimism and vision, didn't think you were on a specific case there.  But yes, I'd listen to what he said but would still take it with some salt, regardless (is just sensible to do so).  I'm not going to slate the games subreddit for being wary of promises or cynical - we are consumers being sold something.  People in general should be more forgiving of developers to a point though, the work does take time and as long as they communicate in a genuine fashion people shouldn't harp on them too much.   I guess the fact SC has garnered so much money with people spending thousands on stuff that doesn't exist yet also gives the game an iffy aura."
starcitizen,3e2bci,Delnac,0,Tue Jul 21 13:30:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but we're way past the grain of salt stage. People are emptying the entire salt mine whenever a thread pops up. And that's not just SC, people are being extremely unforgiving of things that are common sense in the industry. This tendency really grinds my gears because of how utterly counter-productive and abusive it is.   I can relate with you when you said that we as consumers are being sold something through pledging, that we should be careful of what we choose to support. But in SC's case it comes with a lot of disclaimers and frequent updates that people conveniently ignore when criticizing it.  In the end, I think SC is just the first project of its kind on this scale. We have a cultural problem from switching to a crowdfunding model to get the games we really want. It'd be better for us as consumers if publishers built the game, but they proved more than a decade ago that they weren't keen on the whole ""innovate"" thing."

Because the game's funding model is completely new. Because its perception has been further skewed by media outlets. Because a vocal minority has no idea how games are made and is up in arms when they hear about delays no matter what two decades of gaming history tells them.   Yet they keep pushing these sales, having fancy new advertisements to try and drum up sales for each new ship.  If anything they are taking advantage of the communities willingness to throw money at them.   How dare they need money to create the game? Is that it?   You are conflating the existence of a concept sale with the requirement to buy anything. They aren't taking advantage of anyone when they repeatedly state that you don't need to buy anything. The community is also made up of grown adults who might have a couple reasons to feel so enthusiastic about the game.  The perception of these sales can't be helped, but the motivation to hate them is simply irrational.   People wanted the ability to unlock ships/components without having to spend more money, because anyway you looked at it, Arena Commander was pay to win. REC was CIG's solution to that.   And they have been given exactly that. The only downside to REC is the renting system, for which a lot of fair criticism can be voiced either way. I personally don't like it. I can see its merit but the lack of game types just doesn't make it work for me yet.  In the end, I fail to see your point. You are blaming CIG for needing money to create a AAA game.

You criticize their entire business model, yet I don't see you offering anything better or realistic.   Not at all.  They have over 84 million in funding, far exceeding what they set out to achieve, yet they continued to try and find more and more ways to get more funds.  Which in itself, is not a problem, but couple that with deadlines missed by years and freemium currencies and people start to become more sceptical.  If CIG started again, and attempted to raise the same funds they have today via kick starter, it would not work.  If CIG gave dates of 2017/18 for potential release from the start, told people of rental currency and online cash stores and continued concept sales, they would not have raised so much money.  They got in an on an idea that was previously not tried, and capitalised on it.  Which is in itself not a bad thing, but we are yet to see if they will be able to deliver.  I'm not saying they won't deliver a product, I'm simply explaining why some people have grown sceptical of the direction they are going.   REC had been asked by the community time and again. And then it got labelled as feature creep in one of the most ironic heel-face turn of opinion I've ever seen.   REC was never labelled as ""feature creep"", it is simply an inclusion of a totally un-needed system.  There is no reason why they could not have allowed people to earn UEC through Arena Commander play so they could unlock ships/components to test, but then wipe these before PU release unless you had spent actual money.  Instead they take the time to build a freemium currency with cries of ""this was the plan all along""  Did you read Chris Roberts explosion on the forums after the REC backlash? It's quite a read..."

I am going to nitpick your reply here and add that since the $19 mil mark, any model in which the funding stopped went out the window with the community vote. We are getting as much of a game as they can deliver.   But that coupled with deadlines missed by years and freemium currencies is the reason people became so sceptical.   Forgive me, but I'm tired and sad that the crux of the issue is always the same thing. It's always about delays. I really want to blame shows like E3 for this. As an old-time DAoC player, I remember the CM Sanya Thomas talking about post-E3 parties a decade ago. Everyone was awkwardly joking about release dates announced in the morning that they all knew they were never going to make. Missing deadlines is routine stuff to game developers.  Delays are also rarely failings on behalf of the developers. Sure, there are plenty of cases of mismanagement, incompetence and others. But they raise all manners of red flags for years and never produce remotely as much content or technology as SC does.  Delays start happening as soon as you try to go for something new. As CR said, you can mitigate that by building in some buffer, have good progress tracking and putting experimented developers on point. But at the end of the day, you can't anticipate when a new gameplay is going to click or when art is going to be good enough. Moreover, with any enormously complex project involving breaking new technical ground, show-stoppers are going to ruin your day no matter how well-designed your solutions are.  Even games sticking to formulas for which all of the answers have already been found suffer from delays. I just wish the gaming community understood how normal and expected those are in large-scale game development.  This was a very lengthy reply so I'll just stop here. But I really think that with crowdfunding we are going to have to solve that cultural gap between gamers and game developers.  Edit : I saw you edit in that they missed deadlines by years. I'll have to ask you for a honest example here. And you can't rewrite history with rhetorical questions stripping the context of various events."

But it has been a long while since I've encountered a developer as bad with targets as CIG (probably last time, it was again Chris Roberts with Freelancer).  But again, the delays are not the sole cause of the scepticism, it's also the strange funding model and extreme concept sales and development decisions on funding.  Like I said, we don't know yet if it will work out.  But if you are saying there is absolutely no reason for anyone to be concerned, and that anyone who does shown concern or doubt is crazy... then maybe I think you need to take another look."

starcitizen,3dzs0s,acdcfanbill,295,Mon Jul 20 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"Q1. What the fuck is wrong with you that you can't even produce a goddamn FPS on a fucking FPS ENGINE?   A1. The thing about most FPS engines is that they cheat like motherfuckers. The cam ends up in somebody's chest, animations for the first person are different from the third, it's all a mess. Unfortunately we can't fucking do that, because those cheats go out the door once you start to toss in all the other stuff we have (like what one guy is doing being visible by someone else). So consider this all R&D, remember that technology development is hard, and realize that project management is basically one part herding cats and one part fortune telling. As for other stuff, networking is a bitch.    Q2. You basically fucked off for the last three months, right?   A2. The only thing I avoided for the last three months is you worthless cunts.   Q3. Disco Lando was kind enough to share us more content in one image than you fuckers have in an entire year of puff piece videos and bullshit reveals. What do you have to say for yourself?   A3. Well for starters we didn't want to spoil the fucking single player game for you. SURPRISE ASSHOLES THERE'S A BIG FUCKING SHIP AND IT LOOKS AWESOME. Also a bunch of our people are perfectionists and fucking loathe the idea of having something WIP get torn apart by a horde of self-entitled virgin man-children whose primary source of sexual gratification comes from wanking over pictures of starships and then bitching about flaws that only they notice.   Q4. Controller balance. Fuck you.   A4. Gimbals are here to stay, so fuck off about that shit. Our long term goal is to make the game sufficiently accessible for all forms of controllers, but ultimately balanced such that a very skilled joystick user with fixed weapons will have an advantage over a mouse user equipped with gimbals. Part of this intent is evident in how we've significantly upped the damage with respect to weapon size so that the correlation is roughly exponential. Shit will change as we include bigger ships, multi-crew, and all the other factors LIKE THE REST OF THE FUCKING GAME. That said I acknowledge that you assholes still are playing a god damn game and having nothing change for months is kind of bullshit, so I'm ordering my minions to emphasize balance in future iterations. Apparently ignoring you guys for months has consequences.   Q5. OH GOD PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SKY IS FALLING TRAVIS WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?   A5. With 250 fucking people you're going to have turnover. Travis left because he loves World of Warcraft more than he loves life itself (sorry Chelsea) and Blizzard gave him an offer he couldn't refuse. Alex left for personal reasons, but that means that the ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET WHO CAN TELL ME TO FUCK OFF is now in charge. Seriously, Erin knows his shit. You like what he's done with Foundry 42? Well now he's taking over global operations.    Q6. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH YOU FUCKSTAINS HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE SHIP I PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR! Why isn't my Caterpillar/Merchantman/Idris/Reclaimer/Orion/Carrack/Genesis/Javelin/Starfarer/Herald/Khartu-Al out already?   A6. Let's put it this way; this shit is so fucking complicated that it's taken two of our senior ship artists over six months to redesign the Constellation. We have fourteen eager slaves working their asses off getting content out as quickly as possible (including five working on the Idris alone), but priorities mean Squadron 42 content has to come first. Priorities include the Starfarer, Herald, and Cutlass, but we're also going to focus on getting ships that have specific gameplay integrated quickly as well so we can flesh it out early. Oh by the way FUNNY STORY it turns out that this shit is so fucking hard that outsourcing KIND OF FUCKS THINGS UP so we have to do it in house. We're hiring!   Q7. Why won't you stop selling concept ships?   A7. Because you addicted fucks keep buying them.   Q8. Scope Creep. Scoooooooooooooooooooooope creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. Scope creep?   A8. The way that Star Citizen has gotten bigger since the original scope is that it's gotten bigger. I'm going to chatter about dreams and doing the game I always wanted and all sorts of other fluffy bullshit, but in terms of actual changes I'm not going to say a single fucking thing beyond Squadron 42 having more missions. I will, however, try to convince you that the Persistent Universe was a stretch goal instead of being planned from the start and try to compare the scope to when the Kickstarter was first created as opposed to when the game was fully funded a year later.   Q9. SOME PEOPLE are implying that this game cannot be made. Your response?   A9. I'm basically going to spend the next ten minutes waving my middle fingers in the general direction of Dr. Derek Smart.    Q10. What's next for Star Citizen?   A10. DID YOU NOT JUST FUCKING LISTEN? JESUS FUCK. Gamescom is coming up. Shit will be revealed. After that? FPS. Then multi-crew. Then PU shit. Ideally in two months this will all behind us, but in spite of all of the bullshit that's happened recently I'M STILL GOING TO THINK IT'S CUTE TO KEEP THINGS A SURPRISE and not tell you what to expect at CitCon. In an ideal world it would be Squadron 42. In reality it will probably be disappointment."

starcitizen,3dzs0s,Beer4TheBeerGod,6,Tue Jul 21 00:49:33 2015 UTC,Looks like the PU was the 2.5 million stretch goal.
starcitizen,3dzs0s,spleeeem,5,Tue Jul 21 02:29:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the way Chris said it implied it wasn't a feature planned from the start. Which is, to use his own words, bullshit. Look at the Kickstarter itself. If CIG didn't get $2.5 million are we to believe that they wouldn't have a PU? Star Citizen is the Persistent Universe. It's right there under the ""real quick, Star Citizen is..."" section.   The bottom line here is that even when directly asked what's different about SC from the original scope, all he can say is that the game is bigger and SQ42 has more missions. After $85 million and 3 years of development people should expect significantly more than that."
starcitizen,3dzs0s,polyinky,3,Tue Jul 21 02:41:48 2015 UTC,"While the Vision or dream's scope has not changed much even since Freelancer (giant sandbox in space where you can do anything), the actual scope of the game that is realistic to create considering the circumstances has changed dramatically.  and now for something really long that says the same:  I'm pretty sure what CR means that it wouldn't have been feasible to have a PU (at all) in the initial release at the bare minimum funding. While the dream was always there, at least since the Freelancer days, to create a giant sandbox, technology and money were not. So way back when, the crowdfunding was supposed to show investors that there is a market for a space game and then get like 10-20 million to release a game that was much smaller in scope than what the actual vision. I believe that a first release after getting the PU stretchgoal would have been pretty bare bones with a few fighters to pew pew in a few systems, maybe move some cargo. (Remember when the initial goal was to make maybe a handful or 2 systems). CR kept talking about the model Minecraft started and wanted to follow a path like that. So after this release the plan was to get some more money with the initial sales, keep developing, eventually getting to the grand goal of a giant sandbox.  The old ATX offices, it seems to me that was the size of the development team they thought they would need to make their first release with the funds they planned for. I think it was like 20 in atx and 5 in LA. With these kinds of resources you can't get what they are aiming for now.  Also way back when, they asked what people wanted to do in the game and it turned out plenty of people wanted to be space truckers, adventurers... That seems to have influenced the scope of the game too, CR keeps mentioning these polls and forum threads. Since at that point they had already decided (or were about to decide) to not take outside investors, they could allocate more money and time (i.e. refocused ATX) to flesh out the entire non-combat parts of SC.  Along the way of developing with their initial plan they would have hit the same issues they face now (netcoded laawwwl). Being forced to release as they'd run out of money and investors would want ROI, they'd have to use workarounds that don't really solve the problem, use rougher art assets and thus waste money.  Even now, if they stuck with their initial plans to release a barebones alpha to get more cash, they would waste money as they wouldn't be able to properly solve the big issues they face now. Also the art assets would probably still be a lot worse than they are now (the old hornet for example), again they would probably waste money getting art assets playable just to toss them away later. We could also have ended up with a much more inconsistent experience where old systems would look sub-par to newer ones. Either way, not a great situation.  So what I think is that with the current plan, actually getting a giant sandbox with tons of stuff to do (and not only dreaming about it) is much closer than it would have ever been under the old model of development. Which is a good thing (tm)."
starcitizen,3dzs0s,Beer4TheBeerGod,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"If CIG didn't get $2.5 million are we to believe that they wouldn't have a PU?    Yes. I've always envisioned Star Citizen as another Wing Commander, not another Eve Online.   Unfortunately I think the community has taken it the opposite.   Ever play Freelancer?  That was a badass single player game that had a decent multiplayer aspect.  That is the vision of Star Citizen, not what I think most of the community unfortunately thinks, which is Eve Online with a bonus single player game.  Edit: To add, maybe people that have played Freelancer back in its prime will understand more. If you weren't lucky enough to play it, let alone to try the multiplayer experience, it was essentially this:  Cool single player game where you travel through I think 60 sectors and ultimately conclude the game. It was amazing. Then, when you were done, you could hop into a multiplayer server which was essentially those same sectors but now with real players flying around the same area.   That is precisely what Star Citizen sounds like as well, but if one was never lucky enough to experience it, I can see why they think Star Citizen is going to be FPS Eve. Which I think is going to let a lot of people down."

Assuming a real-world scale, an orbit around Earth at 400km (where the ISS orbits) is 7.67km/s and you'd go around the planet in about 93 minutes. If you were to have an orbit around Jupiter that distance from its atmosphere, your orbital speed would be 41.98km/s and it'd take you about 3 hours to orbit.  As far as transiting between the planets: assuming the quantum drives are capable of instant acceleration and deceleration (which I doubt they will be, but I'll assume they will be for the sake of easier calculations) and are capable of modifying your velocity vector so you can go from orbit of one to orbit of the other, going from Earth to Jupiter when the planets are at their closest would take 2 hours 43 minutes.

Cloudfront pricing is freely available from AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/   Based on this and Chris's ""multiple petabytes per patch"" comment, they are probably dropping about $100k per patch JUST TO GET THE DATA OUT TO US.

It's soo much art to produce. And seems to take so long. Constellation rework was what? 6 months. By their two top guys. Just for the rework.   And they ""only"" have 14 vehicule modelers. The bengal is hundreds times the volume of the stella.   If anything makes me nervous it's that kinda ""math"". On the surface of it, the Bengal looks like it will take years even with tripling the vehicle artist crew....  And then there's 400 planetside locations.....

And give us a feel for how much faster they could do the Stellan now with the process in place. Another point would be the new component size classification introduced in the latest Jump Point. There are no words to how relieved I was when reading that one. Then there's the modular room approach.  As a non-artist. The art creation scope is beyond comprehension. Any of them concept art pieces for planet side locations they release make me drool and go ""how on earth will they manage?"" at the same time.  To this code-monkey it seems they could hire every 3D artist alive, clone each one and still there wouldn't be enough to get it all done ;-)"

From something they were saying pre-FPS delay, it was going to get pushed to us slowly, in a series of patches. Hence it makes the most sense to push it back given the delays."

However I think its more of issue with time frame and wanting to get ""headline"" features out quicker.   The've stated several times before that they like to have about a month between new modules. However in the current time frame with the FPS delay, the've lost the space between FPS and AC2.0. Hence social features which Ben said are more modular will role out probably between what we know as AC's 2.0 and 3.0 and the different new gamemodes that will role out (as i understood from the BenForTheChairman) between 3.0 and PU alpha."

If anything this video gave me less faith in development.  People always denounce anyone that says ""feature creep"", but now it seems that Chris always originally just planned to do Arena Commander and SQ42.  Only then when they saw how much money people were willing to put in, did they decide to expand it to what it is today.  He makes it sound like the backers demanded it... but I for one would have been happy with the original vision, as that was something that I saw as possible.  Sure, build on that afterwards, but build the core vision first then see where you can take it.  I mean, that is feature creep in the purest sense of the word.  Also, does it not concern anyone that Chris Roberts sees the end result as a ""bonus"" and the journey worth the price of entry?

The game hasn't changed much in the last year and I seriously doubt what we are seeing/hearing now will change up to release.   People just need more patience.

starcitizen,3dzs0s,Spoogefish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"only grew as the game became more popular and they could afford more staff for more features   That's not really true.  As the funding came pouring in, they kept adding more and more stretch goals which further increased the scope of the game.   It's not like they created it to a point, and thought ""hey were have extra resources, lets add this""   The stretch goals and scope of the game expanded much faster than development.   Anyone thinking this game was coming out in under two years hasn't been following the game since KS.   People go off release dates that CIG set.  Sure, take those with a grain of salt, but when they overshoot by not months but years, people start to wonder and question if they have taken on more than they can handle.  Also, we are now approaching 3 years, and we have a tiny part of what was originally scheduled to be released."
starcitizen,3dzs0s,SirDigbyChknCaesar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:51 2015 UTC,It's hard to assign a release date to anything that winds up involving R&D.

starcitizen,3dzs0s,Davepen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"Ok so I boils down to this. Walk away or stay. You can have concerns but the game is going to largely be made the way CR wants it. Believe me, they didn't just ""come up"" With the idea for the PU and FPS out of thin air. It was always on the drawing board but their budget outstripped their vision. The backers allowed them (and gave them tacit approval) to realize said vision. I'm sorry that it sounds like you just wanted a decent game with good graphics and gameplay. I see where they want to go and I'm ok with taking the ride. I pledged what I was comfortable in walking away from (if it ever came to that) too many people didn't."

We have been burned by this multiple times before so I have heeded all your wishes to not give out dates until we are sure. Perhaps we stressed the point a little too strongly as suddenly gaming websites were running with the headline, “Star Citizen FPS delayed indefinitely!” which was unfortunate as this phrase is usually a euphemism for a project being put on indefinite hold or canceled.

Obligatory car analogy: While at first you wanted to sell a small compact car to fund your dream of an amazing luxury sportscar/truck/tank hybrid your funding grew that you could create that thing right now. A combustion engine doesn't cut it, after researching the problem for a year or so you conclude that you need to replace it with a fusion reactor and drive the wheels with small but incredibly strong electric motors. While you can use an established high performance chassis, no one has ever developed a working fusion reactor let alone fit it into that chassis, there are no electric motors that work to your specifications, and normal cables start burning from the power draw. In only 8 months you develop the worlds first working fusion reactor, in that same year you have also greatly increased the efficiency of electric motors, and the cables don't burn anymore. While you still need to perfect the systems, you have a good idea what brakes and tires you need. In that time you also designed the exterior and interior and have some of it already in place. While you were doing all that, you also built a world wide company, hiring experts in fusion generators, electric motors etc. All that in a few years. People complain that you take so long, because in the same time BMW released a slightly updated version of their previous car.  God I love car analogies."

starcitizen,3dzsxl,wesha,7,Mon Jul 20 22:11:45 2015 UTC,I'm not one of the detractors. I've supported this from the beginning and I believe in this project.  But can someone explain the benefit of splitting the teams across great distances? Or even having such large teams? Sometimes expanding team size actually cuts down both productivity and innovation as people feel like you'd have to get change approved by too many people.  You tend to have a better working rapport for people you can talk to face to face.  I work for a massive global company and there is benefit to serving all our markets and providing 24 coverage around the globe. But I'm most effective working with people locally.
starcitizen,3dzsxl,enderandrew42,21,Mon Jul 20 23:47:59 2015 UTC,First thing that comes to mind is the crazy team of Germans making the engine modifications possible. How many of those would have moved to LA?
starcitizen,3dzsxl,lordx3n0saeon,19,Tue Jul 21 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"You get a lot of things:   Possible lower costs, so more people working. 24-hour coverage and work time (potentially). You go where the expertise is: For example, getting the German office online is great, because they can snag a bunch of ex-CryEngine engineers.  This kind of thing tends to work best when you have each team working on discrete tasks."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,MisterForkbeard,8,Tue Jul 21 00:14:31 2015 UTC,Hiring Cry engine people in Germany does make some sense.
starcitizen,3dzsxl,enderandrew42,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:18 2015 UTC,I wonder about the costs though. Setting up a new office somewhere for a team of that size (~50 people) isnt cheap.
starcitizen,3dzsxl,Oddzball,8,Tue Jul 21 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"Very true, but it can weirdly be much cheaper than expanding an existing location.  For example, if the LA office is at full capacity getting 50 more engineers there would necessitate getting a new building in a location where space is not cheap. Likewise, those engineers might get paid more in LA than they would in Germany (or the UK). Lastly, there can be tax breaks and other incentives for CIG to have an office in other countries.  The real problem is that spinning up a new office causes a lot of ramp-up problems - it will take even longer to get those 50 people working at full efficiency (something that in the best of circumstances might take 3-12 months), simple because there's not already experienced employees present to act as trainers and problem solvers."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,MisterForkbeard,7,Tue Jul 21 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"Also, don't forget that those ex-Crytek devs may not consider moving to a different country for a job. And even if they are willing to move, all the logistics (ie. Visa) need to be worked out."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,Isogen_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, it takes damn near half a year to spin folks up at my location, because in addition to ""mentoring them"" I still have to do my actual job."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,Oddzball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. At our company we try to send out people for long-term help: For one office, we sent out 20 or so engineers for 6-week periods, and had at least 2 senior engineers living there full-time in year-long shifts. It worked reasonably well.   But even when training new people at my current location, we don't really count them as working well until they're around for 6 months, and it takes a full year to get them up to the point where they're just firing on all cylinders."

starcitizen,3dzsxl,Longscope,9,Tue Jul 21 09:01:53 2015 UTC,"But can someone explain the benefit of splitting the teams across great distances? Or even having such large teams? Sometimes expanding team size actually cuts down both productivity and innovation as people feel like you'd have to get change approved by too many people.   Sure, I can answer that from a PMs perspective:   Having global or even distributed operations within a country allows you to tap into a larger talent pools. Most people are unlikely to move long distances (esp. to a different country) for a job. So by CIG going to different countries and setting up studios, they can tap into the talent pools of those countries. Also note, that in CIG's case, they are getting some nice tax breaks in the UK at least.  As for large teams, some things just require a lot of manpower. This is especially true for art assets. There's thousand and thousands of art assets they need to make ranging from plants to space stations and all of them need to meet certain standards/quality. DO keep in mind that a lot of these people are probably part time or contract based. A while after the game launches (~1-2yrs), the numbers will go down by around 20-30%. Communication definitely becomes an issue with a large team, and that's why they have project managers and people taking care of the logistics. As for innovation, imo, as long as the company culture is right innovation will happen even with a large team/employee base, a lot of this boils down to the mid and upper management personnel in how ""cooperate"" they are. From what we've seen, CIG seems to be doing a good job with balancing this."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,Isogen_,4,Tue Jul 21 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"The benefit of having teams across the world is that you can attract more and better developers who are not willing to move across the world. For example, the new Foundry 42 studio in Germany, came as a result of CIG hiring a lot of CryEngine developers who lived there in Germany. Rather than force them to uproot their lives (if they took the job offer), they created a local studio which allows them to have the job the want and stay 'at home'.  With large teams it really depends on the project managers and producers to organise all the studios and developers. Most studios are focused on one part of the game (Foundry 42 UK - Squadron 42, CIG Austin - PU, Illfonic - FPS) so that does help with working locally."

starcitizen,3dzsxl,wesha,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:10 2015 UTC,Yep!  That's why they do conferences in person from time to time.  They've mentioned this in the past when they do meet and greets that it's really beneficial to meet someone you've been skying for months with.  They just had Erin from Foundry 42 over at the Santa Monica office recently.
starcitizen,3dzsxl,Cplblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:30:48 2015 UTC,"Travel like that isn't cheap. I get opening an office in Germany to snatch up Cryengine engineers in particular, but I don't understand 4 separate global offices per se."
starcitizen,3dzsxl,enderandrew42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"Others have answered already but I wanted to chime in.   For starters I am with you, having multiple teams all over the place makes it difficult to stay organized as they start becoming insular and have hard time staying up to date with what everyone else is working on, in fact these are issues that CIG has admitted to having from time to time.   On the other side however having too many employees in one place also has issues. I have worked as a project engineer in a 300 people office and the bureaucracy and logistics involved cause a lot of inefficiencies a lot like having teams in different places does. Chris Roberts himself believes this and it was one of the things he didn't like when at EA the studio had grown to be hundreds of people he didn't know. I work at a 30 people office now and every thing just goes so much smoother.   In CIGs case their primary reason is talent. The Austin studio for example is where a lot of CR's older game development contacts are Austin is currently a growing scene for game developers. Its where CryTeks U.S. office is located and as we know they need as much help with CryEngine as they can get. Similarly their Frankfurt office is made up almost entirely of ex CryTek engineers who were either let go or quit during CryTek's recent troubles. Rather than trying to move them all, which wouldn't have worked since not everyone would move, CIG just created an office for them as again they need more CryEngine experts. Illfonic, the studio working on the FPS module while not having made the kind of tactical shooter CIG wants still has experience in making FPS games based on CryEngine, so again a good addition for CIG. And lastly we have their largest studio in the U.K. Erin Roberts who leads the U.K. studio already had a team with him that had worked together for years so rather than try to move them all they let them open an office in the U.K. This was also extremely beneficial from a financial point of view as CIG now gets a 25% tax break from the U.K. government, that is a huge amount of money.   So there are pros and cons like any other system but for what CIG needs this system works for now."

Not long after that we will be releasing the next level of Arena Commander, allowing players with bigger ships to fly them with friends, on maps that are closer in size to the huge ones you’ll have in the final game. Then we’re rolling out aspects of the Persistent Universe: first there will be just planet side environments to explore, but not long after you’ll be able to transition to space and fly to another destination, and then after that to another system.    I might be mis-reading, but does that mean the release order has switched around? I thought it was FPS ---> Social ---> AC 2.0 but that kind of sounds like Social and 2.0 might be the other way around now.   Not complaining, they'll both be awesome.

You all know that already; you’ve lived that. You’ve seen Star Citizen evolve and start to come together.

There are people out there who are going to tell you that this is all a BAD THING. That it’s ‘feature creep’ and we should make a smaller, less impressive game for the sake of having it out more quickly or in order to meet artificial deadlines. Now I’ll answer those claims in one word: Bullshit!  Star Citizen matters BECAUSE it is big, because it is a bold dream. It is something everyone else is scared to try. You didn’t back Star Citizen because you want what you’ve seen before. You’re here and reading this because we are willing to go big, to do the things that terrify publishers.

starcitizen,3e1bp9,Leviatein,4,Tue Jul 21 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, honestly I was surprised their license didn't include the 64 bit version, or rather that there wasn't a 64-bit version of CryEngine until now.  Either way, was pretty surprised when they announced they had just ported the engine to 64-bit. Awesome news either way :3  Edit: Er wait - that's just the coordinate system, right? Not the actual client itself? I think I got myself mixed up a little bit."
starcitizen,3e1bp9,P4ndamonium,16,Tue Jul 21 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"A 64-bit program is one that can address crazy amounts of RAM, compared to the ~3 GB or so that a 32 bit program can address.  The kind of 64-bit stuff you're hearing about now is about the size of the numbers that they use to describe where the player is in space. 64 bits in a floating point number means that the numbers can now be extremely big (and, as a result, also extremely precise).  Without these massively long number forms, when the numbers got really big, too many of the bits were used up by the ""huge number"", and fewer bits were left to describe the sub-integer precise details.   With huge 64-bit floats, we have all the precision in the world. More digits/bits = bigger/more precise numbers!"
starcitizen,3e1bp9,Zee2,4,Tue Jul 21 07:49:26 2015 UTC,As far as I know they ported different subsystems of the engine to 64 bit. Apparently there´s no need for every subsystem being ported to 64bit in order to get the stuff working CIG intends to use.
starcitizen,3e1bp9,Mipsel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"Expanding on what /u/Zee2 said -   32bit/64bit program has to do with something called ""Pointer Size"" (as well as instruction set, but that is less important). It determines how much memory the program can address.    When CIG is talking about 64-bit they're talking about using IEEE double for storing coordinates in space instead of IEEE single  - choice of data type for coordinate storage is a developer decision not a compilation decision.  And making the switch means they have to go through the entire program finding every single place the differentiation between single and double precision matters, and updating accordingly.  Its a lot of spelunking through old code in the depths of cryengine."
starcitizen,3e1bp9,Kazan,7,Tue Jul 21 18:30:59 2015 UTC,"They converted CryEngine from single-precision floating-point format to double-precision floating-point format.  Another way to describe this is floating point converted from 32 bit to 64 bit.  While 32 bit floating point only allowed them to create environments/maps in space of about 20 km across, 64 bit should allow them to create maps potentially up to billions of km in diameter.  Essentially the much larger format allows them to much more accurately describe the position of an object (like a spaceship) within a very large space."

starcitizen,3e1bp9,wesha,5,Tue Jul 21 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"The imperial system is rubbish, but a fractional system for daily use makes a lot of sense.  It is a lot easier to work with because of the logic, but base 10 is harder to work with (slower) for certain tasks. The fractional system works well with construction because humans are pretty good at guessing what half of something is, or what 3/8"" from an edge would be. Although this is still all relative and based on the (quite horrible) imperial system it still makes things a lot easier.  You can do this with the metric system (half a cm, or a quarter m) but it is harder to break down into 'non-symmetrical' numbers. Like we know what half a meter is, but what is 1/8 of a meter? I bet if you asked a bunch of people in NA to show with their fingers what 1/8"" looks like compared to 1/8 cm they would be much more accurate with the inch (where as they would be comparably accurate with 1/2"" or cm because it is more symmetrical).  Anything other than base 10 should die though, it just doesn't make sense to support anything else (other than the, 'well shit, we are to deep into this now, if we wanted to change to metric it would cost billions in infrastructure changes).  So yeah, fuck imperial, most of the time at least."

starcitizen,3e1bp9,TrueInferno,6,Tue Jul 21 06:57:32 2015 UTC,You don't.  The gas giant serves as the backdrop for the map.
starcitizen,3e1bp9,PeseusPrime,6,Tue Jul 21 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"Think of a grid system and each grid is 2700km in diameter.  there'd be 65 (rounding up) distinct grids that make up the space around the planet.    The gamescom demo is going to occur in one of those 65 grids which happens to have a couple of moons inside it's diameter.  You're not going to be able to go to the planet, but depending on how close the grid in which the demo will take place is to the planet, we may not see much else...."
starcitizen,3e1bp9,TheLucarian,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:43 2015 UTC,"With 65 grids, you would only have a very small part of the orbit covered (Edit: In one narrow line around the planet, that is).  The equator of the planet alone is ~571770 km, if I'm not mistaken. And if the moons were only 2700 km apart, or in proximity of 2700 km of the planet, they would crash into each other, most likely. All I'm saying is, the math doesn't add up right now.  Edit: You would need about 212 boxes to cover a single line around the equator (and a stable orbit would be much further out), and the planet surface is about 104,062,115,058 km² (right?), you would need about 14,275 of 2700x2700 km boxes to just cover the planet surface."

starcitizen,3e1bp9,Rarehero,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"Alright, legit attempt at a review; it's all the best bits of Rust and Day Z rolled up in a ball together, with a heavy dose of Minecraft on the side. If you like those games, you'll love Ark. If you don't like those games, this probably won't change your opinion.  At a guess, most of the negative reviews probably come down to one of two things; first, it's in early access (hence, buggy and lacking some features), and second, the developers still haven't solved the perennial problem of the PVP survival genre, which is how to encourage ""anything goes"" style open world PVP whilst still discouraging players from choosing whichever method of warfare yields the greatest results for the least risk. If you choose to join a PVP server, you can expect a lot of cheap tactics, basically.  That being said, the developers are extremely communicative, and the game gets substantial updates at least once a week. There are tonnes of official and unofficial servers, and the software to host your own is a free download. Many servers enforce their own rules to discourage certain types of gameplay, so if the game itself is more or less your thing, you'll almost certainly find your particular flavour out there somewhere.  Personally, I'd say it's more than worth the thirty dollar price tag."
starcitizen,3e1bp9,human_error,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the above. particularly the OMG RIDE THE REX! portion.  The trick really is all in the balance. If you get a decent server, the game is much more enjoyable. Better yet, you can host your own server and invite your friends. That's what we did, we setup a 3305 LOCAL server, we set the rules (pve), we set the length of time to tame, we set the day/night cycle lengths. It's great.  I view the official servers the same way I view PUGs in MMO and FPS games. Some are gonna be great, others are going to be total shit... all depending on the batch of people you get. When you already know the people, or at least the kind of people they are, then it's a great time.  Now, it IS early access, there's almost no optimization, particularly the graphics engine. But NVidia is giving the ARK devs a hand with that directly, and the devs update quite often and, like CIG, they really listen to the players. Given time, this is gonna be a really great game. Right now, it's a hoot and a holler, but it's got loads of promise."

starcitizen,3e0djf,samfreez,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking, without a fail safe, it would be possible to fire your weapons until you sped up past the exit velocity, at which point the weapon would effectively backfire.  Now the interesting bit would occur if you COULD shoot backwards.  Technically you could speed up to the opposite exit velocity, thus dropping your round at a dead stop.  That wouldn't work with a laser, of course, but a physical object or possibly plasma could exit and exist in a much slower velocity than normal.  Of course that depends on the ammo being an actual thing, rather than an intangible data point that disappears after X amount of time."
starcitizen,3e0djf,samfreez,9,Tue Jul 21 01:19:20 2015 UTC,"This is true in an atmosphere (because objects are only as fast as their thrust/drag ratio), but absolutely false in a vacuum. If you are driving at 300m/s in an atmosphere, and shoot an object at 50m/s, it will go backwards (at around 250m/s).  In a vacuum, the same object will go forwards, at 350m/s. For a vague reference, sit in an aircraft, and shoot a nerf bullet forward the length of the craft. Regardless of the speed of the craft, the bullet will still travel the same speed relative to the craft, and the speed of the bullet will combine with the speed of the craft, relative to the earth.  Note: DON'T ACTUALLY SHOOT NERF GUNS IN AIRCRAFT."
starcitizen,3e0djf,katalliaan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but I have to wonder how that'd work in reverse still.  Would it just travel 350m/s slower than the craft, but travel in the same direction as the ship?"
starcitizen,3e0djf,samfreez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:43 2015 UTC,"If the ship is moving at 300 m/s and the gun's muzzle velocity is 50 m/s, firing it forwards would mean they're traveling 350 m/s and firing it backwards would mean they're traveling 250 m/s, but still going in the same direction as the ship."
starcitizen,3e0djf,Master_Gunner,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, so then that brings me back to the question of matching speeds firing backwards.  If the projectile went 50m/s, and you did 50m/s firing backwards, would it not just slide out at a stop?"
starcitizen,3e0djf,katalliaan,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:37 2015 UTC,That's exactly what you'd see.

starcitizen,3e0djf,UmbraeAccipiter,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"relativity is a funny thing.  So you have two ships going 50m/s in the same direction (so 0 retaliative velocity to one another).  Both ships are facing each others, so one is going backward one forward.  If both ships fire a projectile going 50m/s at one another, the projectile fired forward is now moving at 100m/s where as the one fired backward is going 0m/s... but as speed is retaliative, both parties only see at 50m/s projectile fired from two stationary ships in space.  An outside observer might see it that way, as one ship slams into a stationary bullet, and the other is shot by an extremely high speed projectile.  Yet the overall effect would be similar to both craft."
starcitizen,3e0djf,T-Baaller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"Also note that in a vacuum speed is is retaliative, if you are speeding a projectile to 50m/s then you are going to have some reverse thrust applied to you...  So while it is impossible to fire a bullet backward it is fully possible that each shot will get slower than that last (as your ship slows down) until such a point that from a retaliative position they appear to start firing at negative velocity.  (once your craft was going negative 51m/s from the relative viewer's position).  So your not wrong, but physics is kinda weird some times."
starcitizen,3e0djf,T-Baaller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"Once a ship is at quantum speed, I reckon it should be able to maneuver around freely, so if two ships were together at quantum speed, they should be able to maneuver around each other and dogfight, while the galaxy flies by their battle at .2c"
starcitizen,3e0djf,softieroberto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:11 2015 UTC,"That would work for any other game (that didn't care about physics), but .2c is 60,000,000 m/s, or 60,000 km/s. It takes you a longer than second to even say 60,000, and your quantum drive would've already pushed you that many kilometers. When you maneuver a little too tightly at 300 m/s in Star Citizen's world, you black out (because the blood is rushing from your brain). Similiar to real life.  Tell me, would you like to test your theory in real life? Maneuvering even one degree at 60,000 km/s would kill you so quickly your opponent couldn't even measure the TTK (time to kill) in seconds. It would be femtoseconds."
starcitizen,3e0djf,italiansolider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a misunderstanding here.  Their maneuvers would only be relative to each other, as they battle each other.  To an outside observer, they're both going within a fraction of a percent at .2c, in a nearly straight line.  Like having a fist fight on a constantly fast airplane and no turbulence.  You're moving around just fine inside, but to the outside view you and the other guy are moving at 400mph accross the sky.  Quantum travel is like the airplane, and you and the other ship are able to move about relative to each other."

starcitizen,3e0djf,Kristoph_McKane,8,Tue Jul 21 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think Chris misspoke.  If the fastest ship travels at 300 m/s it would take 168 hours to travel across the 182,000 km diameter of this gas giant.  He stated that you could fly between its moons in 2 1/2 hours but the distance between these moons is surely at least the diameter of the gas giant and probably many times that.  Therefore there is no way it would only take 2 1/2 hours to travel between the moons using normal thrusters.  From what we've heard, quantum drive speed is 0.2 the speed of light.  At this speed you could travel from moon to moon within seconds.    For it to take 2 1/2 hours to travel between moons that are separated by hundreds of thousands of kilometers your ship would have to travel at tens of thousands of meters per second.  So, I'm confused. I'm not sure what Chris was trying to say.  EDIT:  I hope Chris didn't mean to say 182,000 meters instead of kilometers.   If the diameter of the gas giant is only 182,000 meters (182 km) then his 2 1/2 hour travel time remark between moons makes much more sense."
starcitizen,3e0djf,softieroberto,13,Tue Jul 21 03:34:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the deal is that the current Large World map that they have is 2,700 km or so.  The map is part of the orbital space around a 182,000 km diameter gas giant.  The moons on this map are up to 2.5 hours @ 300 m/s (2,700 km) apart.  This will be the first Arena Commander 2.0 map by the sounds of it.  Full system maps in the PU are expected to be millions and millions of km across."
starcitizen,3e0djf,wilic,3,Tue Jul 21 04:50:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok.   So this large world map is essentially a condensed version of the full system maps that we will see in the PU and because it's a condensed version the moons in it are only 2,000 to 3,000 km away from each other.  I got the impression that we would be able to orbit the gas giant if we wanted to but in the case of this condensed map it will simply be a distant background."

starcitizen,3e0djf,Kristoph_McKane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"Completely untrue. Check out Uranus, for a punny comeback. It's moons in many cases are closer than the 1600 miles difference between the two moons in SC that can be traversed in under 2.5 hrs at 300m/s.  For help in reading the chart... the Semi Major Axis is the distance the moon's orbit is from the planet at it's farthest. If two moons (such as Cressida & Desdemona, or Cupid & Belinda) have Semi-Major-Axiis that are under 1600 miles apart, that means at their farthest peak from the planet, they are still within 2.5 hours travel time every time they line up, and that travel time is even shorter for the rest of their orbit - that's just at their farthest)."
starcitizen,3e0djf,Blysill,4,Tue Jul 21 04:16:13 2015 UTC,Your comment is only even remotely accurate if we're talking about moons that are less than 100 km in diameter and are essentially the size of asteroids or comets.   And even then they would only possibly come within that short of a distance from each other during a very small percentage of their orbit.   If we are talking about  moons that are spherical and are in the size range of the 14 largest moons of Uranus then your argument is completely inaccurate  because their semi major axes differ by tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of kilometers.   Chris said that this gas giant has three or four moons. I seriously doubt that these moons are tiny asteroids.   I'm confident he's talking about larger moons that actually look like moons that we are familiar with.
starcitizen,3e0djf,knightedchaos,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:05 2015 UTC,And I'm fairly confident that the astrophysicists who are working on nearly every aspect of Star Citizen will make sure the orbital distances don't conflict with the lunar diameters.
starcitizen,3e0djf,theesado,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the moons will be orbiting, and their size doesn't matter all that much to how far apart they are.

Griefing would be absurd. People buying the smallest, cheapest, fastest ship just to constantly harass merchants trying to jump from one system to another.  Trust me, either you misunderstood Chris's intentions, or Chris hasn't thought this out."
starcitizen,3e0djf,italiansolider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:05:16 2015 UTC,Cheapest smallest fastest ship and then be blown out of the sky. This is just the interdiction you'll need backup.
starcitizen,3e0djf,Bzerker01,4,Tue Jul 21 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"But you're not understanding. If I can take an M50 and block a Hull-E from jumping, then I can spend my time griefing a high security zone by zipping in front of them when they are prepping to jump. If they attack me, they are initiating combat, not me.  And trust me, if all it takes is me flying in front of them, people will do it ""just for the lulz"" - griefers exist for the pure purpose of making another person not enjoy the game.  Which is why I am very certain this mechanic, if it is what they intend, will not stand for very long.  And that doesn't even begin to cover the insanity of trying to balance this against a populated universe. Is there a minimum range? If so, what is it? What if that range exceeds my computer's current LOD settings? Do I then get blocked by a ship I don't even render? How do I gauge when and where to jump?"

starcitizen,3e26ci,Stupid_question_bot,5,Tue Jul 21 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Not necessarily. They could just as easily generate missions with a fixed number of enemies, and a ""recommended squad size"" in the description. Assuming that the payout is also a fixed amount (for that mission), that the team then has to divide up between themselves, you get an interesting element of risk vs reward. Bring a bigger team, less risk, but everyone takes home more pay. Bring a smaller team, everyone gets paid better, assuming you don't get horribly murdered.  With the Galaxy Server (theoretically) having the ability to spin these missions up as required, you can still create more than enough content to suit everyone. Assuming there is some kind of grouping/party system involved, you could even have the Galaxy Server look at the groups in a region, and spew out more missions that are approximately at the right difficulty for those groups, with a random +/- X to create some interesting choices for the group leaders.  Of course, creating ""more than enough"" may not even be the desired goal.  Forcing groups to scale to the mission size also allows you to create a certain amount of ""supply and demand"" with mercenary work; because it's still somewhat up to the players to find missions they're able to handle (rather than every mission just adjusting itself to their group automatically), an area with a lot of similarly sized mercenary teams might end up with a lot of competition for work. This brings CIG's information gameplay into the mix, because knowing where to go looking for work becomes really important. Maybe your high rep with the advocacy leads to a hot tip about an outbreak of gang crime on a certain world. The local police are hiring mercenaries to supplement their overstretched forces, and there's good work if you can get in there before everyone else does.  It would even encourage interesting social dynamics. Maybe an area is overtaxed for solo missions, but has some jobs that need a team, so you go hit the local bars and find some other mercs willing to work together. Maybe there's a really juicy mission that's just way too much for your team of four to handle, so you have to form an uneasy alliance with another squad. The payout will be worth it, but can your two teams get along without the squad leaders butting heads? That's basically an episode of your favorite sci-fi TV show right there."
starcitizen,3e26ci,Voroxpete,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Missions are generated dynamically based on the person looking at the board.  So yes, it makes perfect sense that if I'm in a group of 12 players, all the missions I come across will be scaled to work for that number of people"
starcitizen,3e26ci,Stupid_question_bot,4,Tue Jul 21 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Well hold on now, where are we getting that from? The original description of the mission system (from the economy video) was that missions were generated by the Galaxy Server in response to factors in the economic simulation. The specific example given is a factory that puts out a mission for explosives to fill needed supply. They clearly state that the mission may be taken by a player or by an NPC, which pretty clearly implies that everyone is pulling from the same ""pool"" of missions. Do we have more recent information that says otherwise?  Either way, if we say for the sake of argument that you're right about that, it still doesn't preclude the option of having missions generate with an assigned difficulty rating (as opposed to scaling to the group you bring with you). The benefits I described, in terms of risk vs reward and the incentives for social interaction, would still hold true. It's also more immersive, giving you that sense that there's a bigger world out there beyond yourself, and there's really no ""cost"" to doing things that way, since the mission generation is all procedural anyway. Given that ""immersion"" is one of CIG's watchwords, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they went in that direction with it."
starcitizen,3e26ci,Voroxpete,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"I would say you are right but also wrong.  What you are saying only applies for when the mission is generated.  If I have 2 friends with me, a mission will likely be set up that is designed for 3 people.  If we add one more person to the group after accepting the mission, I doubt that it will scale up.  AFAIK none of us and likely even CIG aren't sure about that yet though."

You board someone's Idris during a firefight, you need to get to the bridge and secure it with your team.

starcitizen,3dzxqe,doublarthackery,7,Mon Jul 20 23:08:24 2015 UTC,I burst out laughing when I heard that..... at my desk... at work..... I got some very strange looks.
starcitizen,3dzxqe,Valkyrient,-4,Tue Jul 21 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"The criticisms still stand until the game is released. It's a risky venture for a reason. It doesn't matter who brought them up or how, they're still valid. I know there are a few things in particular that I'm not hopeful for at all, namely regarding head-bob and first person camera mechanics, and the Cutlass. I don't have faith. I don't have a lack of faith. I'm just waiting.  And if this game fails miserably, I'll just be sad and move on. All of you ""faithful"" on the hype train will turn into a rabid mob. Be rational, don't go looking for things to put faith into or bolster your hype. It's just talk, and that's cheap."
starcitizen,3dzxqe,kodiakus,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:31:45 2015 UTC,"And once again, we start hating everyone with valid criticism just because our Lord and Savior said few reassuring things, still without providing any meaningful progress on SC. 6 days ago everyone was saying how balance is for beta and completely meaningless now. 3 days ago people were disappointed how lacking in new features the newest SC patch is. Now everyone is happy with few balance changes and 2 new flyable ships after months of no patches or visible project updates.  I'm so happy to see everyone still operates on blind faith here and downvotes those who refuse to listen to the word of Dev."

starcitizen,3dzxqe,fast_cart,40,Tue Jul 21 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Transcript by Erris, StormyWinters, KagedGeek, Ghost404, and Myself  Welcome to Ben for the Chairman, the 60th episode of the 10 for series. This episode is special, as Chris has been away for some time.  As such, today’s Ben for the Chairman episode will delve into a number of topics.   As the full video is an hour and a half long, INN will start with notes, and will attempt to complete a full transcript at a later date.   00:00:00 – Introduction and Squadron 42 Update   Working on Performance Capture shoot was awesome. Wing Commander 3 and 4 were live action, green screens and such, but tech has changed so much. Now they can do something completely different. Motion capture is just the body. From Uncharted or the Last of Us, that’s Motion Capture. Faces and such are hand animated after. With more recent technology, CIG can get the entire facial performance of the actor. They had a 66 day shoot, longer than any film Chris has done. 53 days of full performance capture; 3 cameras capturing face, 50 capturing movement. Performance capture lets them capture the full emotion of the performance. Chris is very excited by how the performance capture will bring you into the game. Goal with SQ42 is to deliver emotion in a story in a video game that maybe hasn’t really been done in the past. Script was over 600 pages. 90% of the p-capture scenes are not cinematics driven, they’re player driven. Don’t know where the player’s going to be in the scene or enter the scene. Lets the player move around a ship and interact with crew members and decide on the relationships to foster. Should make it a lot more affecting if someone you’ve taken the time to connect with dies later in the story. SQ42 is not an ‘extra’, it’s a full, AAA game. SQ42 is what they were originally talking about during the initial Kickstarter campaign. Because of the funding, they’re able to invest more into the game and the technology. First-person conversation system will carry over into PU. Average Hollywood script is between 100 and 120 pages. General rule of thumb is a page a minute. SQ42 script was 5x longer than a movie script. Just filming the conversational pieces. Action sequences are part of the game, and don’t get counted in there as much. The storyline has a trilogy set up. And they’ll also be telling other stories inside the PU as well. The Trilogy - it’s not one game then some DLC. It’s Wing Commander 1, 2, and 3. Movies are good at telling stories over short periods of time - Die Hard happens over one night. Novels are better at telling stories over long periods of time. The scope they’re hoping for is three full, standalone AAA titles. Think Episodes 4, 5, and 6 of Star Wars. At least a 20 hour experience. Just the performance capture stuff that was shot is 5-6 hours of content, then there’s all the action. You don’t want to play something that’s not great, and Chris doesn’t want to make something that’s not great.   00:19:39 – What is the status of Star Marine?   Hard at work on Star Marine. Illfonic are working round the clock on it, and many people in other studios are working on it as well. Chris has some code up on his screen that he’s helping with as well. Lots of people working on it in the Frankfurt office as well. CryEngine’s very powerful, but it’s dense and complicated as well. Having the engineers that built it helps. They have the engineer that created CryAnimation, which is a great resource to have. Working on closing out a few things:    Networking (Networking’s a bitch, whether on SC or any other game). Working on getting 32 players in Astro Arena and at least 16 in Gold Horizon. Ultimately want to push beyond there. Animations. Challenge on the animation is that most FPS games have first person and third person. First person is essentially a floating camera. Not physically realistic, but it’s normally okay because you can’t see your character. It’s also why, when you get into mulitiplayer in something like Call of Duty, the animations aren’t nearly as fluid. Player animation doesn’t translate to what someone does in first person.    Real life has inertia. If SC were just doing an FPS, they could do what CoD does, but the foundation for the whole game is First Person. Because it’s a multiplayer game, there has to be player controlled characters interacting with their environments, and that has to look good. CIG can’t ‘cheat’ and put arms up where the eyes are, like many other FPS games do. Means they have to unify first and third person together. If they can get it to work, it makes life simpler. Camera where the eyes are. They use tricks like camera stabilization - In real life, if you’re running, your brain makes it so you don’t look like you’re bouncing up and down so much. That kind of logic has been built in. Lots of work with animations.   GIF of Chris Roberts showing movement transitions  Lots of animations that can normally work for AI, but it takes more work to build them into player animations, and to keep them responsive and fluid, without hampering the player experience.   This is one of the reasons FPS has been delayed. Not something you can say ‘this’ll take a week to do’, it takes play time and experimentation time. Don’t want to put it out if it feels slow or unresponsive, or if there are glitches. Yes, it’s an alpha, but it will inherently hurt the feeling if the animations aren’t in. Making really good progress, hoping it’ll be able to be played on PTU at or after Gamescom (don’t hold him to that though). Definitely working really hard on FPS, and it’ll be a great foundation once it’s done. Definitely not ‘indefinitely delayed’. More people working on it now than ever before. It’s frustrating for CIG as well, they want it out as soon as possible as well, but if they’re not happy with how it feels yet. When they do put it out, it will still have issues, it will still need polish, but it will be able to be played. More constructive for feedback. Definitely thinking in terms of weeks, rather than a month. The delays don’t have as much to do with the FPS portion either. If it was just an FPS, they could get it out. The delays have to do with the feeling of the PU as a whole. Rather do one thing right, rather than do two different ones and then have to waste time refactoring them later. Frustrating, but it’s a better way to look after everyone’s money. FPS is foundational for the whole game. Apparently Crytek had talked about doing this sort of first and third person unification on Crysis 2 and 3, but gave up because they had deadlines. CIG have made more progress than when Crytek were trying. Don’t see it a lot in games, because it’s very hard to do.   00:31:08 – Have you been in contact with the team?   CIG are already built to be a distributed development company. Teams in Austin, Santa Monica, Frankfurt, Manchester, then outsourcers in Montreal, Denver, etc… They already deal with being separated by time and space. Everything is already online, and they use Shotgun to pass things back and forth. When Chris went to shoot in Eyling, they set up a fast connection for him. Shooting days were from 8-6, then he’d do video conferences with the UK and Germany, and with the U.S. Lots of e-mails, lots of online comments, all of CR’s waking time for the shoot and the weekends was either directing the shoot or managing the project. Part of the reason Chris didn’t do much community stuff, he was swamped. 16-17 hour days. Also brought people down to the shoot, lots of the UK guys came down and some U.S. folks went over as well. Ben tried to search for how many e-mails Chris has had in the past 3 months on Outlook. It broke the search.   CONTINUED IN REPLY TO THIS COMMENT"
starcitizen,3dzxqe,Aieris_,19,Mon Jul 20 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"00:34:12 – Why is there stuff in the leak we haven’t seen?   CR - There’s a couple reasons. Reason # 1: It’s a narrative story we want you to experience. If you see every aspect of it the whole sense of discovery won’t be there, and that’ll hurt the experience. We definitely want to keep a lid on the SQ42 aspects that are part of the story. Some of the general stuff like what does a Vanduul look like, that’s fine. A lot of the specifics like locations, characters, even some of the ships you’ll be on (flying or coming up against) we wanted to keep as a great discovery and surprise. Reason # 2: We have a lot of stuff in development and just because of programmer finishes writing something doesn’t mean we instantly put it out there. We have to test and polish it, refine it. When we think it’s in a good enough state to for some objective feedback, we get it out there and see what people think. That’s a big point for us. Programmers and artists here, it’s a constant fight because they want their stuff to be perfect. We don’t want to share stuff to early. It’s pretty stressful for an artist if you share something too early that he knows has 20 problems with it, then every backer gets on a forum and points out those 20 problems. It’s the same thing with Star Marine and why we aren’t sharing the build right now which we play test every week. For those reasons, we think there are points where it’s useful to share when the discussion will take it to places that we need that input on. We try to have these gates where internal development, we get it where we like it, then pass it to QA, after QA feedback to you guys, and you guys give us feedback and we take that back and work on it. That feels like a positive iteration cycle. We share it well before we would share it if it was our sorta final publisher game so I think you guys get a view of it sooner than you would normally have. Like I said we’re not going to share everything from day one for the reasons given. BL - The work has to speak to the vision rather than something we’re not happy with yet CR - You don’t want to show work, just to show work. You want to show work that says, ‘Hey we’ve taken it this far and we would love your feedback.’   00:38:20 – What are your thoughts on controller balance?   Feels like one of those battles, like Waterloo. Controller balance is going to be a complete ongoing thing, it’s something we’re very aware of. I’ve stated from the beginning I want the game to be controller agnostic so I do not want there to be a super class of user that because of their controller they can be better or beat everyone else. We do have inherent problem controllers in that some different controller interfaces are good for different things. So, a joystick or HOTAS is much better for flying precisely than a mouse, but a mouse if using a gimballed weapon is better for precise aiming. For the same reason a keyboard/mouse on a PC can school anyone using a gamepad in an FPS shooter. So, they have different strengths and I think the right answer in this is to allow complete option, player can have whatever they want, and to make sure the strengths of one thing are countered by a con. Like… yes, you have aiming if you have a mouse and gimballed weapon but your flying’s not so good. If you have joystick and you’re flying, your flying gives you an advantage that you can use over someone with a mouse. We haven’t got that balanced properly yet so that’s where we’ve been working on stuff, 1.1.5 patch that’s coming out we’ve still been playing around with some of the stuff. One of the big things, we’d announced awhile back was gimballed weapons...the gimbal itself takes up a size class and you have to drop down a size for a weapon Problem in the past, the size 1 weapon damage output compared to the size 2 damage output, there was maybe a 20-30% increase between size 1 and size 2. That doesn’t make much sense, it should be closer to say twice that much. I’m not saying it’s twice as much but if you get my drift you have a real pro and con there. The guy with the joystick, he might want to go with fixed weapons so that’s more difficult to put on target but when he does, he’s doing twice as much damage as opposed to a mouse who’s easier to put on target but doing half the amount of damage. You’ve got other things, the bigger the gun gets on the gimbal, maybe the slower the gimbal reacts. Those are things we are actively wanting and trying to balance. The biggest problem is we have so many things going on and we also have other considerations. Right now you’re just playing AC with single seater ships and dogfighting and the full game(PU) is not going to be all about that. Multicrew ships are going to be one of the big things. Flying with NPCs or friends and there’s going to be a whole different variety of different piloting styles. You can’t take a Constellation and dogfight the same way you can in a Hornet but other things in a Constellation you’ll have an advantage with. There’s also other things like in AC, there’s that respawn mechanic, people fire a bunch of missiles then they kill themselves so they can fire more missiles. That’s not going to happen in the real game, first you won’t want to kill yourself cause that’s a pain in the ass. Second, missiles are going to cost credits that you’re going to have to earn so you’re not going to spam them like that. There are certain play styles right now that happen in AC that won’t happen in the final game, that can give you an impression that one controller can have an advantage. We want to make AC itself a fun experience for everybody using their controllers and each one having their pros and cons. Also be aware that there are other considerations we are just coming into so in some ways we don’t want to be definitive, like, this is what it’s going to be like. We have to get the multicrew ships in and a bit more variety happening before we have a good sense of the full picture. Figure out how to best give each controller it’s own pro and con and make them feel sorta equal. Not to say we don’t experiment and play around with stuff, I think one of the problems is we held off on an AC patch because we thought FPS was going to be sooner so we haven’t really patched anything in AC for quite a few months. That was our sorta balance iteration. 1.1.5 has some balance iteration stuff that will hopefully make this a little better, maybe it won’t. I’ve made a real sorta commitment now and focus on the team and say, ‘No matter what, we’re busy trying to get things out like say multicrew, FPS or SQ42.’ We can’t constantly be iterating on AC and trying to improve that and balancing that and taking people’s feedback. If I go take a look at being away and come back, it sorta feels like there isn’t a lot of new things to play with, at some point everyone gets bored and it becomes more about arguing about things then playing stuff. We’re trying to get back onto the content and delivering and taking people’s feedback and adjusting. Be patient with us, we’re committed to make it a fun experience for all. For all means, beginners playing the game have it fun. Then there’s detail and depth that more experienced people can get into. You sorta grow with it. My goal, so easy to play but hard to master. It’s a cliche in the game business but it’s a very true mantra of what would make a good game. We are focused on that so don’t worry the way the controllers are aren’t the way they’ll continue to be. Our plan is not to gimp things but to really try and make things have their pros and cons. It will take time to get there and we’ll need your feedback. BL - So to speak directly to the controller balance thread, you would say gimbals are here to stay but we want to balance them in such a way that folks more skilled with a joystick have an advantage over someone using mouse. CR - Yeah, 100%. I can’t see any version of the future that you wouldn’t have some level of your weapons gimballed. Like Star Wars, there’s guns on turrets and stuff but there needs to be a con to that, to a pro on someone’s that flying…..Luke and his X-wing didn’t have gimballed weapons and he seemed to do pretty good. BL - He had a magic force. CR - The Millennium Falcon had it’s little turret on it. So, obviously gimbals and turrets for the same multicrew vehicles are super useful cause they won’t have the maneuverability that a single seater fighter will. We certainly don’t want it to be that someone with a gimbal has all the benefits and none of the downside, that’s kinda the goal. We’re committed to making it as balanced as possible. I would say in general, you would see more turrets and gimbals on bigger ships to make up for the maneuverability. The smaller ships we’re going to try and balance in such a way that you can put a gimbal on it but you’re kinda nerfing your ability to do damage. We have all this tweaking for power, distribution of that and shields. We’ve only scratched the surface of that and the physical based damage will also help alot with the balancing. It’s early days, ultimately with your help we’ll have something maybe not everybody’s 100% happy with but I think it’ll be good enough for everybody and I don’t feel like I’m unfairly hamstrung   CONTINUED IN REPLY TO THIS COMMENT"
starcitizen,3dzxqe,cosalich,14,Mon Jul 20 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"00:46:57 – What’s the story behind recent staff departures?   Just a natural thing; they have a very big company (255 people in house) and you just get turnover when you get to that size. There’s a lot of different reasons why people leave; they get an offer they couldn’t refuse or they get to do their dream; for most people here, what we’re building is their dream, but in some cases, like Travis Day being a World of Warcraft nut, working at Blizzard has been his dream.  You can’t really stand in the way of something like that. Generally on a turnover basis, it’s been no different than when Chris was at Origin, a studio that grew from six at the beginning, to 110 when EA bought it, to 300 or so when Chris left; didn’t even know half the people and people were always coming and going, and that just kind of happens; it’s unfortunate and sometimes it’s for personal reasons. At CIG they’ve got a really great group of people and really great infrastructure; in some ways people see it more than they would normally, because they show more people than just the front person on a project, but you won’t see the whole staff. CIG show the whole staff, especially those in L.A. Just because one person is showing off a feature, doesn't necessarily mean they’re the one driving it. They’re working on it, but there are probably 10 other people working on it with them, and you don’t see them. Part of the downside of being as open as CIG are, there’s just more exposure to the regular comings and goings of a large development studio. To work on SC and SQ42, you have to have a certain mindset. It’s hard, you’re not shielded from anything. If people are complaining because something’s late or broken, there’s a developer on the other side that’s going, they don’t like what I’m doing, and it’s hard to deal with that all the time. Need to be ready for that if you’re going to be part of CIG. No particular ’sky is falling’ scenario. Alex left for personal reasons. Erin Roberts has agreed to become the global manager of production, which will help centralize and unify production techniques. No-one CR has worked with better than Erin. And he’s Chris’ brother, and he can say things to Chris that other people might not. Erin’s very good at coming in, pulling things and people together, and getting things done.   00:54:09 – Why isn’t the concept ship I bought playable, yet?   Part of the issue is all our ships are incredibly detailed and incredibly complicated Seeing the concept at first(which takes a lot of time creating the 3D model and conceptual design) is just the tip of the Iceberg when it gets to modeling and putting it in engine there is a huge amount of work and iteration which goes between the artist, the designers and the animators to get all the features working, to make them functional inside and the spaces work. The Constellation rework’s been going for about 6 months, the Retaliator took 8 months, and lots of that was refining systems, finding ways to reduce draw calls, etc... Considered outsourcing but it's too complicated due to the back and forth between departments 14 people on staff are dedicated vehicle artists. Looking to hire more hard surface modelers. With that number of resources and the amount of time ships take you have to have a level of priority and for us it is Squadron 42. Squadron 42 is definitely going to be there before the full PU, so it has been taking priority because there is a lot of ships to build there; the Vanduul ships, the UEE Navy ships and some of the aux ships like Starfarer, Herald the Cutlass. The Idris, the Bengal, they’re huge ships, and they take a long time. 5 or 6 working on the Idris right now. Just posted on the forums a schedule for the ships All ships will be completed but the priority moves about depending on Squadron 42 and the persistent universe. They are feathering in persistent universe, Squadron 42 ships that involve other kinds of game play that are important because they want to experiment with kinds of game play in future versions of Arena Commander that won’t be just about combat but things like mining and cargo. When they get multicrew, they’ll look into prototyping gameplay that’ll happen in the PU, like one person flies a cargo hauler, a few more people flying escorts, and then the other team’s pirates trying to stop them. That’s the longer term plan for Arena Commander. They’ll try to keep everyone up to date with the ship schedules more too.   00:58:48 – Why do you still have concept sales?   One: The community likes them and asks for them; constantly sees threads asking for one ship or another. Two: It’s obviously a good way to continue to raise funds for the game; it’s a big endeavor with a lot of people working, and more money equals a bigger richer experience they can do from the start. Also allows for investing more in the online cloud stuff earlier; they’ve been delivering petabytes of data for patches and updates and that all costs money, much more than they estimated at the very beginning. Concept sales help support that in addition to obviously helping with development costs. Three: Really wants to seed the universe with all these ships. People want to have a mining corporation, they want to build a huge merchant empire, they want to shuttle passengers around the universe, or just go and rescue people, take them onto a hospital ship and fix them up. CR wants to seed the universe with all these different ships and definitely wants to put them in the hands of players; doesn’t want every single player to start with an Aurora because that would feel weird and boring. Just like in real life with different cars, he wants there to be a full range of ships for all the different roles players can choose. Putting them in the hands of players is much better than putting them in the hands of AI, (they’ll definitely have AI running around) but players do the most interesting thing. That’s one of their tenets for the final PU, where players drive the drama and action of the universe; to do that you need a diverse range to go after different roles while also supporting the development of the game. Feels like it’s a win/win. (Ben can already see the [Concern] threads about Aurora pilots having their ship compared to a Ford Fiesta. Chris says nothing wrong with a Ford Fiesta; gets you from point A to point B and the new ones are pretty good. Ben asks how they deal with Vanduul. Chris says your starting ship isn’t meant to be the best ship you can fly.)   CONTINUED IN REPLY TO THIS COMMENT"
starcitizen,3dzxqe,umbralupinus,13,Mon Jul 20 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"01:02:28 – How has Star Citizen changed since the beginning?   It’s changed quite a lot. Started with the demo and a pitch, never thought they’d have nearly the amount of support they’ve had. Chris thought he’d raise between 2 and 4 million, and he had private investors lined up to invest another 10 or so. Planned on working hard to get a smaller, much less ambitious alpha together, then use money from that to build it into the big Universe he wanted to build. Smashed every single stretch goal set in the original campaign, then continued to talk about features, and the community continued to fund them. Amazing amount of support with 85 million dollars. Allows a much more full featured and ambitious game. It’s Chris’ full dream game. Feels like most people have gone, yeah, I want this game, and I’m going to give you the money to do it properly. Yeah, the original campaign minimum amount was increased web communication, and now they post more times than there are days in the week. Second promise was for a multiplayer dogfight, which we have in Arena Commander Last promise was a much smaller SQ42. Even the Persistent Universe was a stretch goal when they first started. Game has definitely gotten bigger, which presents a bit of a problem. Doing more things will take more time. The end result will be better, but there are pros and cons. What about all the people at the beginning that are saying, hey, you said you were going to give me all this in two years? Yeah, they can’t do that, but it’s one of the reasons they went the route of offering multiple modules. Makes it so the players can play it and see features as the game goes along. Gives players something in the short term, and something at the end. Originally weren’t talking about Hangar module, Social module, FPS module, or anything. You get to experience the game in the short term, and you get to watch as the bigger game gets built around you, and built around your feedback. Stretch goal after stretch goal, even though they keep bringing in people and getting people excited, at 65 million, they said there was a huge amount of stuff to get done, and they’re going to focus on getting that finished out, and more money will focus on making everything that was promised as rich and good as possible. Yes, it’s increased in scope, but Chris thinks it’s what everyone wants. It’s the reason to go with crowdfunding too. If there were a publisher, they’d have likely said no, ship the smaller ambition. But with crowdfunding, the community sets the ambition. The community says, we want you to make something big and bold, and they funded us to be able to do that. There’s a level of interaction that exists almost nowhere else. Yes, the scope has changed, and it’s changed because the fans wanted it to change, and supported it in changing. ‘It’s going to be worth it to stay the course’. The amount of game the people who got in for 40$ are going to get is the best deal in the Universe. Hopefully people will think they had a great time watching the game grow, and then a great time playing it. The goal is to make the journey as enjoyable as the final product.   01:14:11 – Is Star Citizen impossible to finish?   CR - Doesn’t think it's impossible at all.  Very do-able; people who feel like that don’t have the technical ability or imagination to do it, they’ve got the fundamental technology pretty much cracked They are going to show the first large world map at GamesCom - you are orbiting a gas giant that is 182,000 km in diameter with 3 or 4 moons which will take 2.5 hours to go between the moons at top speed in the fastest ship; because of this they will have the quantum drive quick jump to get between stuff but it's all in the same area/same level so no loading screens. Been actively working on the large world which is bigger precision for much larger distances - moved to 64 bit for all their 3D positions, blended with the zone system which is a dynamic container system, meaning you can have a zone inside a zone inside a zone which is  a great way for sorting through the data for rendering needs and updates.  Helps deal with the fact that they will have huge spaces with nothing and then areas with a lot of very dense information. The big challenge with Star Citizen is you have incredible fidelity but you also have incredible scale; no one has ever tackled that properly so they’ve built the core to handle that and the background streaming stuff. Will see some of the benefits of the streaming stuff with the 1.1.5 which will include 16 players which is double than before. It should have hardly any glitches when people are respawning because they are dynamically streaming and caching in a new way which will allow this big seamless world. The Frankfurt studio have people who built this engine and they have allowed us to do stuff you haven't seen in a normal 3D engine. The other big technical thing they are working on is the backend moving to 32 players for FPS, looking at multiple servers slaved together in the cloud to continue to improve this. There is nothing that they don't have a plan for.  There is nothing on the roadmap that isn't doable.  Just comes down to how long it takes to get it done, sometimes it takes longer than they like. ""What do I say [to people who think this is impossible?]""  Bull shit.   GIF of the above   BL - Speaking for your team, the challenge is why we're here. CR - Start on a space station, a bunch of people get into a Cutlass, taking off and flying along and finding a derelict Retaliator and crew of the Cutlass EVAing across to the Retaliator, getting inside, powering it up, and flying away.  Will be showing a version of this type of gameplay and it will be real gameplay. Laying the foundations to build this incredible playground for people to spend many years in.  This is what excites them... this is the game they want to play too.   01:21:45 – What’s next for Star Citizen?   Working hard on FPS. Preview of multicrew to be shown at GamesCom which will demonstrate the large world and some of the zone system and the local grid stuff and transitioning between ships all working correctly.  Will show the potential and scale of where Star Citizen is going. ”SOON” after that we will have FPS in people's hands. Then next stage will be the multicrew Arena Commander which will be “not too long” after the FPS maybe 4/5/6 weeks after. Then start rolling out some of the persistent universe aspects. Maybe roll out some of the persistent universe aspects with the earlier modules like FPS or multicrew AC with plan of feathering content out to have some nice stuff to show at CitizenCon.   01:23:21 -- Thank you"

It would be a fairly quick and easy way to test the game mechanics, and the concept sounds ludicrously fun.  Especially if you add the option to deliberately sabotage ships.    Send a few friends out to cripple the power cores of some of the bigger ships, or rig them with explosives, while you focus on repairing a smaller one.  You have to shut off your suit lights while moving around, so as to avoid detection as much as possible...   It would also be neat if the whole goal was to get something from the station, bring it to one of the ships, and get out of orbit (or out of the system) with it."

I could see useful roles for most/all TF2 classes in this game mode actually!  If CIG decides to implement something like this, it could easily be an option within ArComm/StarMarine that I'd love to spend hours upon hours playing... just imagine sniping a poor engineer who was happily doing a space walk to complete repairs on a heavily-armed Retaliator, and then covering your own team's engineer as he goes there to claim it!"

starcitizen,3e0p1w,Alysianah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:58 2015 UTC,CIG loves their blue on blue on blue transparency layers though.  I suspect the radar display change is more related to upcoming radar changes than a conscious design philosophy change.  The real test will be if the MobiGlass is remotely legible.

starcitizen,3e2ipu,MattAces,3,Tue Jul 21 13:33:57 2015 UTC,"sounds like you need more practice to. this isn't an arcade shooter where your going to be taking down your target in a couple shots, and actually the new patch on the test server has raised the TTK(Time To Kill) even higher.  sounds like you just need more practice to me. this isn't the type of game that anyone is just instantly good at. it's all about your personal skill as a pilot"
starcitizen,3e2ipu,95688it,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the sound issues but for Vanduul Swarm its pretty much practice. The AI has fairly predictable flight patterns so with some experience you will get better at staying on target.   The stock guns aren't for everyone but at the same time you are also flying a starter ship. The starter ship isn't supposed to be anything special, its not going to be amazing at combat especially with its stock load out.If you are willing to play multiplayer, even MP Vanduul Swarm you will be able to earn REC which you will be able to use on guns, missiles, shields, ships and eventually even more. *Also weapons are undergoing a revision so I don't want to suggest anything as it will all change next patch.   Things aren't supposed to die extremely quickly though if that's what you are hoping for, unless of course the ships/pilots involved outclass each other by a wide margin. As it will eventually be a MMO of sorts the TTK needs to be high enough that you have time to run or move forwards instead of just going back to repair your ship or worse, constantly recreating your character."
starcitizen,3e2ipu,Zethos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"thanks for the tip! I think missile will really help me out after getting REC to rent one. At least I know I'm not doing anything wrong. The main problem is my screen keep fading white and red, and my pilot sounds like he's going to faint anytime, what exactly did i do to trigger that?"
starcitizen,3e2ipu,Zethos,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:32 2015 UTC,"G forces essentially. You are turning too hard while going to fast to put it simply. It's something you will have to learn to manage. Slow down when turning for starters, throttle control is pretty important but you can hold down the space brake (space bar by default) for emergencies. Similarly you can also use your other thrusters to counter act g forces by strafing as you turn for example. Again it's just takes practice.   I am assuming you are flying the Mustang and not the Aurora since the Aurora has much less trouble with g forces due to simply being slower and less maneuverable. If so note that the Mustang does not have the pylon hard points needed to mount missiles. IMO its not the best idea to rely on missiles anyways as you only get a limited amount and they can be evaded by a decent pilot or even more advanced AI simply by using counter measures and good flying."
starcitizen,3e2ipu,Zethos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"Oh god I wasn't paying attention in the tutorial that's for sure. Thanks for the tips again. Took me almost 3 days to learn how to play Elite Dangerous and now this.   Anyway, I just youtubed a few videos about the audio thing, here's an example https://youtu.be/bB3XvwWMsEc?t=12m24s  Is the voice suppose to be that soft? Compared to the instructor's voice, the ship voice is too soft. I'm honestly thinking of redownloading the whole game because it's annoying if this is a bug. Elite Dangerous AI voice was super loud all the time."
starcitizen,3e2ipu,chorjin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:43 2015 UTC,Can't watch the video right now but if I had to guess then yeah probably.   Sounds are still very much a work in progress. They are currently in the process of switching over to Wwise. Not to mention some ships are just louder than others.
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Aaronexus,9,Tue Jul 21 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of planets being realistically sized. But wondering if planets will rotate as well to give them that extra realism - or whether moons will rotate as well, if they are not tidally locked."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Big_BadaBoom,7,Tue Jul 21 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"I think they talked about this a little in a 10FTC at some point. It was long enough ago that I can't remember the exact response, but i know that they wanted to hold off on the actual motion of orbit around the star. As far as the planets rotating, i think that would be sweet! But would it be hard for them to do?"
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Mobius1422,4,Tue Jul 21 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I seem to remember that too. But it wouldn't surprise me if they pulled the rotating planet out of the rabbit hat at Gamescon. At least I hope so. Still, a static, realistic sized planet is preferable than an undersized rotating planet, as far as I'm concerned."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Big_BadaBoom,9,Tue Jul 21 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"I prefer rotating planets, even if they're undersized. An undersized but still freking huge planet would be almost undistinguishable from a realistically sized planet, in game. But static vs rotating is going to be pretty obvious.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure rotation will be a thing. I'm not so sure about translation movements... I hope they manage it, but I guess I can live with stationary planets :/"
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Gawlf85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, rotating planets would be nice even if they are on the small side. But from the sounds of it they will be big so I am hopeful."

starcitizen,3e0rbv,CrimsonShrike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree. Though in FL, even if the planets did rotate, the landing point was always floating static next to it... If they want to do it realistic and require you to approach the planet from the broad direction of where you want to land, it may be a lil more complex for gameplay, AI, etc.  Nothing extremely complex, though. But I think orbiting planets wouldn't be much more complex than that and everyone seems to think otherwise, so I reserve my judgement for later on :P"
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Gawlf85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"Original, Chris nixed the idea of planetary orbits, although rotations (for day and night) weren't out of the question. However, after Tony became the PU director, he said they were going for orbits in game."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,woolysockofdoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"I guess you mean orbiting? I think they mentioned it once but said they probably won't bother with it initially, which makes sense since it doesn't add much too the gameplay and is pretty hard to implement in an MMO (I don't remember any MMO having such dynamic, constantly changing world maps). I agree that it would be a cool feature though."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,NotScrollsApparently,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"Elite: Dangerous has both orbits and day/night cycle rotations, all in realistic scale so it's certainly do-able depending on how the engine is structured."

starcitizen,3e0rbv,Brokinarrow,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:14 2015 UTC,I don't think it necessarily smeans they will have realistic sizes. It may be only so large for the demonstration. Once they get the system built out they could literally just resize it to suit tthir needs.  Although it could be that they have decided to go full size anyway.
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Deathmonkey7,2,Tue Jul 21 04:53:18 2015 UTC,The question I would like answered is: How close will we be able to get to the planets?  Elite Dangerous has realistically sized planets and stars as well but they seriously limit how close you can get depending on their size which results in every planet and star appearing to be the same size and not nearly as large as it would look if you were in near orbit like the ISS and earth.
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Kristoph_McKane,3,Tue Jul 21 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think they've ever said how high the ""orbit"" instances will be, but they intend to allow you to land on the planets (at a handful of landing sites per planet). They've already shown a planetside demo where a Constellation approaches and lands at ArcCorp, although I wouldn't be surprised if in the final game you have to stop at the orbital instance before you can land."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,katalliaan,8,Tue Jul 21 16:39:16 2015 UTC,Realistic? No. Big enough for suspension of disbelief? Totally.

starcitizen,3e0rbv,pugsaredrugs,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:01 2015 UTC,"You could fit almost 15 Earths in a line from one side of a 182,000km circle to the other. The diameter of Jupiter is 40,000km less than that."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Alture_White,0,Tue Jul 21 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"Could they fit a real size planet in an area that big (say earth)? Sure, but would you really want to spend weeks flying around it. God knows someone would, but would be fun after you did it once."
starcitizen,3e0rbv,Onikame,14,Tue Jul 21 07:05:51 2015 UTC,Why would you need weeks? Chris mentions in fiction quantum drive which could work like Elite: Dangerous' frameshift drive. ED's planets are realistic sized and you can get around the planets very quickly.

If instancing ground locations (in a clever way that isn't overly dumbed down), then perhaps a 1:1 size planet can be accompliced, because of the sheer empty space around every planet, requiring very little of game design other than maybe texturing the planet as seen from orbit.  I would think it could be a good idea to partition a planet's surface, the same way space is said to become instanced."

starcitizen,3e0rbv,Slippedhal0,5,Tue Jul 21 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.   Most of interplanetary space is simply empty space so it makes sense to cut down on distances, considering 1/10 of 30 AU(distance between the sun and neptune) is still 3 AU, which would take 2 hours at quantum travel speed, but making planet size scale with distance would probably affect your sense of scale in game way more harshly than moving planets closer together.

For instance, you can fit every single planet in the solar system between the Earth and the moon, and still have room to spare - and the Earth and moon are very close to each other comparatively.   If you want fun travel times, either Quantum drive needs to be usable very often, or distances need to be shortened, or some combination of those two things needs to be implemented."

I'm not in favor of one or the other, I just used my mouse/keyboard as it didn't require me to clear desk space for a joystick since I also work from my gaming computer.  I noticed during the previous patch that it added some instability to mouse aiming, when trying to focus on the target I didn't notice this before, the best way I can explain it is that the aiming reticle becomes erratic and has quite a bit of drift/wander to it now.  1.1.5 has introduced an entirely different feel to the control of your ship, without trying my joystick out I'd have to say that they managed to completely nullify any preference I had for the mouse previously. I'm in no way trying to start a control argument here, I merely appreciated the mouse control previously because of my situation, if it is deemed appropriate to handicap the mouse aiming then so be it, I will dig out my joystick if necessary.   Edit: For reference, I've been pc gaming since the early 90's. I remember being very preferential to using a joystick when it came to any type of flight sim/game, I specifically remember my disdain towards mouse and keyboard control when games began to support it over the joystick.

People can argue until they're blue in the face about what's ""realistic"" and what's ""more like a sim"" and what's whatever, but at the end of the day, the CIG team ultimately wants to make a fun immersive game, not an un-fun 100% accurate simulation.

starcitizen,3dxzax,skunimatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:38:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there is a genre of games called ""Space Sims"" in the late 80's and into the 90s like Wing Commander, Xwing, and Freespace that to define the genre, but they were not space flight simulators.  Examples of space flight simulators would have been Microsoft Space Simulator back in the day or Orbiter for more modern PC's.    However people have taken the term ""Sim"" to mean ""Simulator"" and since there hasn't been much of a  ""Space Sim"" genre for the past 15 years there is a generation that hears ""Sim"" and automatically thinks simulator as in FSX or DCS.    But even with DCS there are varying degrees.  Flaming cliffs 3 is very casual compared to A-10C.  FC3, your aircraft start up procedures is turning on the engines (one key bind), turning on your elecontronics (second key bind), closing your cockpit (third key bind), request ATC clearance [not necessarily required], and take off.  Once in flight you're basically controlling the radar scope and selecting weapons by pressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on the keyboard.  You are aren't sitting on the tarmac for 3 minutes for your radar to process a bit test or INS to align or 3 minutes for your mavericks to power on as you are in A-10C or BMS.    Conversely we had space shooters as well such as Decent.  Where as Decent: Freespace was very much in the ""Space Sim"" category with Freespace 2 sill being the definitive title in that genre."

starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,16,Mon Jul 20 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think people realize how realistic physics modelling works. E:D has artificial limits to slow down yaw in order to promote rolling and pitching. SC still has no such limits, its all about thruster output so far which on the case of some ships does promote rolling and pitching over yawing."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Mindless_Consumer,8,Mon Jul 20 14:24:43 2015 UTC,"I am actually sure SC does have limits, implemented differently then E:D, but still limits. Ultimately, you can have a max absolute velocity. So if you are going max V forward, and strafe left, your forward velocity will shrink, artificially. Of course, this is 'controlled' by the computer with the in fiction reasoning for improved handling, but is just an attempt at limiting velocity as to not break the game engine, and enhance game play."
starcitizen,3dxzax,paholg,6,Mon Jul 20 15:35:26 2015 UTC,"In Elite, your forward speed determines how quickly you can rotate, even in decoupled mode.  Star Citizen's model makes a lot more sense."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Mindless_Consumer,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"That is true. At 0 m/s pitch, roll, and yaw take longer to go 360 degrees then at full thrust forward.  Yet both act to limit velocities, so simulation isn't right for either case. In reality a thrust creates an acceleration. So if you pitch up, you would pitch at a faster and faster rate until you ran out of fuel or your ship fell apart. SC the acceleration is so fast you hit max velocity quickly. In E:D max velocity is so low, you hit it quickly. Again, these choices were made for game play and computational requirements."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:39 2015 UTC,Well yeah those limits exist just like the speed limit exists (no matter what you do you won't exceed your ship's maximum allowed velocity in any direction) but thats not really what we are talking about here. Yes all these limits are technically artificial but in the context we are talking about here these limits as you yourself pointed out are handled differently.   *tldr; SC takes realisticly modelled physics and puts them in a world with unrealistic limits such as top speeds
starcitizen,3dxzax,g014n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"E:D also tells a visual story that explains this: there are no significant thrusters that can promote Yaw movement. They are there and can aid with 6-degrees movement, but the main engines take most of the power as it is required for moving the large mass of each ship and jumping large distances in space. And then it messes this up from an immersion point of view when the engines' class don't impact jump distances... but hey! Can't have them all."
starcitizen,3dxzax,redditchao999,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:07 2015 UTC,Why would a ship in space promote rolling?
starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,5,Mon Jul 20 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to and not very ship will. As OP pointed out it depends on the thrusters, the amount, their placement, their output, and so on.   You are not being forced to roll at all if you have throttle control. You simply have access to more thrusters at certain angles.   Now they could make every ship a sphere with thrusters everywhere but they haven't done that so here we are. Lol  There can be a lot of such 'why' questions like top speed, sound, wings, cockpits, drones, and etc."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:37 2015 UTC,You could be right but from what I can tell from playing the thruster output does seem to be different than what it used to be almost universally rather than an individual basis. As I said not every ship is favouring pitching and rolling. The 300i is still better off yawing all the time while the Gladius still yaws quickly but seems to have more control over drifting via rolling and pitching
starcitizen,3dxzax,Gabmaia,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:10 2015 UTC,"I think he meant realistic as far as the ships as they are, not as how they where designed. So the answer to your question seems to be ""because gameplay"" :)   Edit: or, because of the way humans react to G forces in different axles"

starcitizen,3dxzax,_felix_felicis_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"but one physiologic reason would be that the human body can handle vertical G better than lateral G, so it might be that for the little pink body inside the spaceship it's better to roll and turn. It's definitely true that the lateral G one used to be able to pull with absolutely no consequences was totally unrealistic. I guess CIG could do some handwaving to say there's future tech that takes care of G forces... but it's a stretch of the imagination to say we've got tech that handles lateral G but not vertical G, so you can handle infinite G going sideways with no trouble but you still black out with 8-9 head-to-toe G."
starcitizen,3dxzax,redditchao999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:18 2015 UTC,I would like to see them implement lateral g and see how things change
starcitizen,3dxzax,g014n,9,Mon Jul 20 23:13:05 2015 UTC,"Elite is simply way slower, in every aspect, when it comes to ship manoeuvrability (when not in hyperdrive)."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Onikame,11,Tue Jul 21 04:38:36 2015 UTC,There is practically no yaw in ED. It'd take you a full minute if you just yawed  360 degrees.
starcitizen,3dxzax,magmasafe,6,Mon Jul 20 14:02:23 2015 UTC,Well they wanted to encourage rolling more. I get why they did it though I do like that SC and E:D are different.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Onikame,11,Mon Jul 20 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the yaw in ED encourages 0 use of yaw. But the flight mechanics are good for ED. It is what they intended it to be. Even in SC I'm a crank and yank kinda pilot. Mainly using yaw for aiming/positioning. But I like that I can whip around when I like.  I more enjoy SCs model for the drift. And the consequence of over G, (which is a little too easy to do imo) but it's something you have to take into account. I'm also looking forward to the different ship components having their own mass, and therefore pulling on the frame when making high G maneuvers. Watching people (or myself -_- ) tear an engine off from an over-yaw will be something special."
starcitizen,3dxzax,wearetheromantics,4,Mon Jul 20 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"The sliding and drifting is what really sets it apart from ED. In ED everything just feels hamstringed and robotic.  As you pointed out, SC has so much more potential meta within the flight mechanics to create a much more interesting system with better longevity."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Onikame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. EDs flight mechanics leave absolutely no room for originality, style, or surprise maneuvering. You just fly in a loop until you get them in sights; or if they get you, boost away a little and restart the loop process."

starcitizen,3dxzax,Hamilton252,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:46 2015 UTC,There is always a fight between this game will be too arcadey and it will be too much like elite dangerous. The community(or likely the vocal minority) doesn't seem to trust the developers to find a happy medium that best fits this game.
starcitizen,3dxzax,NewzyOne,3,Tue Jul 21 00:55:59 2015 UTC,(or likely the vocal minority)   Nailed it.
starcitizen,3dxzax,blasted111,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:31 2015 UTC,I think there's a third 'faction' that wants as much scientific realism as possible. Which splits away from both arcade and E:D options.
starcitizen,3dxzax,g014n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, E:D is not realistic in any way. It was designed to be slower and the ships' sizes explain this in part, however, it still feels a bit farfetched...   The only interesting part about E:D's manoeuvrability is the fact that the ships appear to use something like Hall-effect thrusters for it, unlike main propulsion... It's a nice touch."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Lawsoffire,4,Tue Jul 21 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"also. Star Citizen is more realistic by default. because in Elite. the thrusters are simply visual, in SC. they actually matter. and they have to move into position before they are worth something.  this is most apparent on the Cutlass, where the 2 powerful moving thrusters on the middle have some lag to them"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Xtanto,3,Tue Jul 21 04:47:48 2015 UTC,Is this true? I am sure I read that Elite uses rigid body physics and real thrusters too? Could you tell me where I can see info about it being visual only?
starcitizen,3dxzax,magmasafe,4,Mon Jul 20 15:22:47 2015 UTC,I think they actually work they just limit things like yaw artificially.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Lawsoffire,3,Mon Jul 20 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"well i have mostly gathered this from gameplay experience.  firstly: the thrusters fire slightly after you change direction  secondly: even though a ship can have thrusters that work well, they can still not work. (an example is: the Cobra has all it's thrusters slightly angled. so yaw should be fairly good, but it is crap. but it has the same amount of the same thrusters on the same angle for slowing down, but slows down much faster)"
starcitizen,3dxzax,zenerbufen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"You'll also notice this issue when strafing vertically if you watch another ship; they burn the entire time, but as soon as you let go of the thruster, there's a slight puff of counter thrust, and then you're stopped."
starcitizen,3dxzax,self_defeating,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"The visuals are fakes, the engines put out real thrust, but the majority are thousands of constant microbursts thats made it look like all engines where always firing in all directions which looked 'wrong' so they fixed it to look more 'cool' and act how people would think it 'should look' based on the movies."
starcitizen,3dxzax,MIKE_BABCOCK,0,Mon Jul 20 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"While we're on the topic of thrusters, could we get more visible effects on maneuvering thrusters?  For example, I don't see how this ship could jerk so violently without there being any thruster plumes visible.  I'd like to be able to actually see the individual thrusters firing and counter-thrusting."
starcitizen,3dxzax,SergeantJezza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:40 2015 UTC,"It's true, elite's thrusters are just visual.  Some of the ships in elite don't actually make sense and wouldn't really work in space. Like the Vulture doesn't even have forward thrusters, put it in Star Citizen and it wouldn't be able to slow down..."
starcitizen,3dxzax,ukkie2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:37 2015 UTC,"To add to your point, I don't think moving towards elite would be a bad thing, necessarily. The combat in that game is pretty good to be honest, just a shame there's so little content."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Dhrakyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:10 2015 UTC,You're not wrong. It could definitely use some more PvP combat content though (which it is getting with the CQB arena update.. But that will be like playing Arena Commander with Elite physics while what the game really lacks in my opinion is meaningful ways to interact with other players and the standing powers).  Fighting the AI is very predictable and once you get a bead on them you just fire till they die most of the time.
starcitizen,3dxzax,monstar28,-9,Mon Jul 20 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"ED was designed to be a console game, of course it is going to be a dumbed down sim.  This is why so many people are upset with the dumbing down of SC.  It isn't even supposed to be a console game, why make it stupid?"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Dhrakyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"How is ED a ""console game""? That doesn't make any sense. They are two different games and even with this change SC is still vastly different imo"
starcitizen,3dxzax,monstar28,0,Mon Jul 20 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"ED was designed from the start as a console game.  It will be released on consoles.  One of the theories as to it's quick and early PC release was that it was more of a beta test of sorts.   This is why you don't do much with the mouse in ED.  SC was never intended to be a console game, yet it keeps getting ""streamlined"" to ""appeal to the masses"" with things like mouse joysticks and kid-gloved physics.  Why the dumbing down if it isn't intended for the hamhanded console crowd?"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Dhrakyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:26 2015 UTC,Oh well I guess til more about ed. I bought it to keep me interested while star citizen is being made. But even still I can ever see SC being a console game. And honestly I like the changes. To each their own I guess.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Beer4TheBeerGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"I like the changes too.  They are a step in the right direction.  However, you either have a game that follows the laws of physics or you don't.  I'd rather they start with ""do"" and tweak from there, rather then bass ackwards."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Ruzhyo04,10,Mon Jul 20 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"Cutlass   Thrusters: 14 (2x TR4, 4x TR3, 8x TR1) Pitch: 14 Roll: 14 Yaw: 6 (2x TR4, 4x TR3) Vertical Strafe: 14 Lateral Strafe: 2 (2x TR3) Forward/Reverse: 6 (2x TR4, 4x TR3)   The Cutlass is an interesting beast in that the lateral thrusters are pretty massive, but where it really theoretically shines is its ability to roll and pitch. The current implementation of the Cutlass is actually not complete, as the secondary thrusters below the main ones are not functional just yet."
starcitizen,3dxzax,MIKE_BABCOCK,3,Mon Jul 20 19:33:11 2015 UTC,I like that every ship will handle in a unique way.

starcitizen,3dxzax,Beer4TheBeerGod,4,Mon Jul 20 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"Something to consider is that not all ships can apply all thrusters in the same direction. For example the main engines on the Cutlass can be used to reverse thrust, but most cannot. The issue of course is figuring out how to best present that information. Something like a table maybe?  Are there any ships that are weaker in one direction versus another aside from forward/reverse?"
starcitizen,3dxzax,DEEDEE-101,2,Mon Jul 20 14:47:05 2015 UTC,Some of the up/down thrusts are probably asymmetrical as well.

starcitizen,3dxzax,skunimatrix,5,Mon Jul 20 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I must definitely agree... It starting to feel much, much better than in the past. I just love how ship takes time to change direction. And how you need to thing where are you are flying to not hit something (Even though I think hitting something won't be that big of a problem in finished game). This patch is definitely step in the right direction.   And I would say that with little more work it could become really great.   It is nothing like Elite though... I do not really see my ships slow my manoeuvring when I fly fast (I really passionately hate that mechanic in E:D)."

First and foremost we are trying to shoot things though, so putting yaw on a twist axis or pedals will not likely help with your aim. Have fun experimenting regardless..."
starcitizen,3dxzax,cavortingwebeasties,4,Mon Jul 20 18:09:38 2015 UTC,Pilots in real life have Yaw on the pedals and have no issues hitting anything tbh. Ive been flying flight sims for 15 years or so with yaw on the pedals.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Oddzball,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"I never put yaw on sticks for any atmospheric flight simulation and as  pilot irl and a long time sim dork was resistant to putting yaw on my stick as well.     After much ac playing, it turns out the masses with background in fantasy space sims were correct -yaw is far more critical in 6dof environment involving shooting. YMMV..."
starcitizen,3dxzax,cavortingwebeasties,4,Mon Jul 20 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"As a RL pilot you dont find it natural to just roll and pitch to line up your target, then use yaw to track and adjust a bit?"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Oddzball,4,Mon Jul 20 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"In atmospheric fight, yes. Playing arcade space sims? Nope, and I thoroughly clung to this idea for the first several months and even used to lecture other rl pilots about the danger of building up unwanted proprioceptive reflexes (muscle memory) to discourage such behavior ironically.     I do find roll on my feet to be quite natural extension of my traditional pilot reflexes though, and the feel of pitch/yaw on the stick was much more natural than I was expecting it to be."

starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,10,Mon Jul 20 20:57:10 2015 UTC,I personally like the change a lot but i fear that AC will turn into blur commander if they dont reduce the blackout effect a bit.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Kaelus,6,Mon Jul 20 21:00:42 2015 UTC,I find myself blacking/redding out a lot less with 1.1.5 than before even in the Gladius so I am not sure what do mean. You black out even more now?
starcitizen,3dxzax,Onikame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:59:09 2015 UTC,Sorry i didnt see any changes to the Red/Blackout mechanic in the patchnotes so i assumed they didn't get changed. My connection is really slow so it would take me 24h+ to download the PTU.  I'm glad to hear they reduced the effect a bit.
starcitizen,3dxzax,skunimatrix,4,Mon Jul 20 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"Well its not a direct change although I am sure they fixed some of the many bugs it has.   Most of the complaints about blacking out come from people who are using boost to maneuver all the time. Since boost runs out much faster now it simply isn't used as often or for as long. Similarly since thruster output seems to be tweaked blacking out seems much less common, to me at least."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Alucard15423,2,Mon Jul 20 14:14:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely certain it's been reduced more than the changes to the thrusters for strafe means when you roll and pull, you're pulling less Gs because you're not changing direction as quickly as before."
starcitizen,3dxzax,EvolutionaryTheorist,2,Mon Jul 20 14:24:21 2015 UTC,Also don't forget comstab is stuck on.
starcitizen,3dxzax,victim_of_the_beast,4,Mon Jul 20 14:21:42 2015 UTC,I don't mind the drift because it reduces the Gs from vector changes. (In a sense) I pretty much save the boosting for when I need to straighten out quick.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Kronok,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:20 2015 UTC,Or you're going to have to learn to fly differently learning to use pitch/roll more than relying on yaw...

Also, I'm glad this has been implemented, despite it making harder work for me with my HOTAS.  Everyone worrying about this should just chill and wait for the more exotic crafts to arrive. I'm sure the Xian scout (and maybe their other ships) will move like yaw commanders want! :)"
starcitizen,3dxzax,EvolutionaryTheorist,3,Mon Jul 20 20:33:21 2015 UTC,The Hornet yaw problem isn't an intended mechanic. The thrusters are broken and are going to be fixed.
starcitizen,3dxzax,ForgedIronMadeIt,2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right. It has that ""drunk tub full of water"" feel back from the original AC release that I'm sure will be fixed."
starcitizen,3dxzax,EvolutionaryTheorist,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"No, it must be the super hornet. The hornet tracker is fine."
starcitizen,3dxzax,opieself,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"I meant more that the move to a more realistic simulation of the ship/thrusters etc. is a good thing. Yawing should be slower than pitching due to the positioning of the thrusters. I'm sure there will be ships designed specifically for yawing with suitable thruster placement, but as for now it makes sense to see the changes they've made. And again, I really think ships like the Xian scout will be an interesting ride in comparison!   I'm so glad they're modeling these attributes of ships - it's creating a real feeling of diversity. So glad that all the ships don't feel the same. In my opinion, one of the big appeals of Star Citizen is the distinct flavour of each ship!"
starcitizen,3dxzax,opieself,3,Mon Jul 20 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yawing should be slower than pitching due to the positioning of the thrusters.   While true on some ships, the Hornet's full compliment of 8 thrusters should be able to affect yawing all at once. The 4 flex thrusters each point in a different direction to promote yawing, while the 4 hinged thrusters on the bottom point 2 forward and 2 reverse. In theory, the Hornet should have the most consistent rotation along each of its axis, as all 8 thrusters should contribute."
starcitizen,3dxzax,wilic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"That would be true if it weren't for the main thrusters which certainly point backwards and which, I assume, can move a little to facilitate pitching!  Edit: Edited multiple times because I am very confused. :)"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Turdicus-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't counting the Hornet's main engine in the thruster count. That one really only affects moving forward. I'm talking about the four flex thrusters on top of the ship, and the four on the belly"
starcitizen,3dxzax,wilic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the main engine supposed to articulate and do thrust vectoring?  (Like, way back in the day, I remember early versions of the Hornet having a more pronounced version of it.)"
starcitizen,3dxzax,dcompart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, well you may be right in that Hornets should be able to turn in all directions. If it's the case that the main thruster either accomodates all turning equally, or no turning, then that's going to be the case. But somehow I got it into my head that the main thrusters can be used to aid in pitching - but that may be completely wrong!"

starcitizen,3dxzax,dsiOneBAN2,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me. On a separate note, what kind of maneuverability upgrades do you think we'll see from the PU? (i.e. actual upgraded maneuvering thruster kits, or just tweaking existing ones?)"
starcitizen,3dxzax,IonHawk,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah from what I know there's lots that can be changed. At the bottom level you have the thrusters themselves which can be switched out and god knows what kind of stats different thrusters will have. Then you have the amount of power possible to send to thrusters via the pipe system, and that can be influenced by all of the other components in your ship. Then at a high level you have the power distribution system where you can, on the fly, adjust the efficiency of those thrusters and choose to over clock them as well.   There's probably more, but yeah man ship tuning is going to be MAJOR in the PTU."
starcitizen,3dxzax,phobus666,3,Mon Jul 20 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yea totally - It's probably tough to accept right now as we don't have the same level of customization/tweaking available now for AC that may exist later/in the PU, combined with the fact that this is 'new' and will take some adjusting/getting used to. In light of that, maybe many of the people that are disappointed (if the Hornet/thrusters are operating as intended), will need to have what you said sink in.     Not to bring up a sore topic with controller balance, but I was thinking this morning along the lines of thruster management becoming key in this new system. Regardless of how you play, you're going to have to use something quick & efficient for changing throttle (i.e. scroll-wheel)."
starcitizen,3dxzax,IonHawk,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten into PTU 1.1.5 because of bugs, but what you have listed for the number of thrusters per given IFCS call means that if there were to be any meaningful lateral strafe with the hornet, there would be little to no yaw rotational limitations. It would be Elite Dangerous like in that the main thruster is used primarily used to change vector, but it would have little bearing on the yaw, that's a artificial ship limitation, even though it's a human limitation."
starcitizen,3dxzax,CMDR_Shazbot,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"From what I've been hearing, the yaw limitations on the Hornet are unintended and should be fixed in a PTU update. As you said, there should be no affect to the yaw speed on the Hornet, as all 8 thrusters should be able to directly affect yaw."
starcitizen,3dxzax,g0rynych,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:46 2015 UTC,Good thoughts... I like the idea that thruster PLACEMENT can be a factor in choosing a ship...   Or outfitting those more crucial truster points with stronger/more specialized thrusters.
starcitizen,3dxzax,WT_FivebyFive,2,Mon Jul 20 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this means that the 300-series will still be strong in yaw.  Most of their 12 mThrusters are pointing sideways, particularly on the tail of the craft."
starcitizen,3dxzax,skunimatrix,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:55 2015 UTC,They still are from the time I've spent with the 325a and 350r.
starcitizen,3dxzax,WT_FivebyFive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Sweet, another way for the 300 series to be superior."
starcitizen,3dxzax,skunimatrix,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"Just so I got this correct as a non native English speaker, Yaw is now far less effective for the Hornet so you need to use roll and pitch more, similar to a real fighterjet?"
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"That's the general message, yes! But it's not exactly yaw that's the problem; it's the engines used to make the Hornet slide sideways. There are fewer of them, so it's less effective.  But yes; roll and pitch is going to be more effective on a Hornet and a few other ships as well."
starcitizen,3dxzax,kokizi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah same goes for gladius, yaw slides like hell (and there is as well little strutter, but that might be a bug), but roll and pitch works just file. I prefer it this way."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"So it does not only affect sideway strafing then? Well, absolutely sounds interesting. I am not sure this is how I want to fly but I am super intrigued to see how this makes all the different ships fly differently.  Maybe I have to move yaw to the twist axis again."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Propadopolis,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"I'm really liking how the PTU is feeling, lightyears beyond the old flight model."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:29 2015 UTC,I tried Gladius in PTU and I liked flight dynamics much more than it was in previous builds. Strafe power is lowered and now it's used to tune your main direction movement instead of flying turretting.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Propadopolis,3,Mon Jul 20 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"This is very good. Instead of spin to win yaw commander, you will now have different playstyles for different ships. You can have varying gameplay from manufacturer to manufacturer and even better, from species to species. The Xi'an ships for example could have minimal drift in any direction with other tradeoffs (fragility, acceleration) to make them balanced.   If I may say so, I feel a bit of vindication against all those who took arena commander v0.8 at face value and tried to shut down any arguments with ""STFU Chris is doing something different"" about a year ago.  I can't wait to fly a ""hotrod"" ship with overpowered main engines and mostly weak maneuvering thusters that requires you to set your ship up in weird angles in order to get the vector you want, then adjust your fire in zig-zag passes.  P.S. Yaw drift can still be a good tool for when you need to....well, drift. Kinda like decoupled mode but more direct and intuitive. Balancing yaw drift, pitch turns and lateral/vertical Gs into a series of smooth maneuvers should be great once it's fully fleshed out vs ""just point the mouse wherever lol""."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Paradox3713,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:56 2015 UTC,"Thing is V.9 and 1.0 continued down the Freelancer/Decent style mechanics without a hint that was going to change.  Things like Mav boost made it worse.    I think most of us that was pushing for this direction were willing to wait and see, but the more we waited and the more we saw showed things moving away from what we wanted."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"Very true. I had 2 auroras, 2 cutlasses and a retaliator before AC V0.8. At the beginning of this year I am down to two auroras (one for my brother) because of the direction the FM was taking. This restores my hope that SC will have tactical maneuvers instead of ""lol drag the mouse a bit idk lol""."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Paradox3713,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:45 2015 UTC,I had a lot more ships and quickly went to the grey market and at least made the money I spent back plus enough to back Elite just after V.8 dropped.  Can't say I regret that decision here today.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothers me at the moment is that I now have pretty much no ability to avoid obstacles.  I feel like this may be much less of an issue in the PU unless they arbitrarily put a shit load of fake asteroids every time combat starts, but when engaging in combat you're focused on the enemy and you're moving quickly.  With all of the drifting you're going to invariably going to be heading toward some debris and your ability to react to that is nowhere near what it was before.  And if anyone has ever watched my stream they would know I could barely ever do that to begin with.  The thing is there's rarely ever anything anywhere in space as densely packed as these maps are.  It's like every encounter takes place inside some rings as dense as Saturn's, if not more.  So assuming that proper open space is a common battlefield, this may not even be an issue."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Paradox3713,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Interestingly ever since 1.1.5 I've collided way less than I used to before. A lot of my deaths on br and nearly all my deaths in VS has been me colliding into asteroids due to spamming the near infinite boost on the Gladius and boosting all the way as I try to take advantage of the flight stick control agility to compensate for the aiming disadvantage. Ever since the change in boost and thruster output, I've started to reach top speed far less and only reserve boost if I wanted tight turns or wanted to quickly correct my angular velocity.  Perhaps comstab being broken is causing problems for some people. I've always played with comstab off however so maybe that's why."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:56 2015 UTC,That could be.  I've always went for having comstab on and gsafe off.  I live on the edge.  And by the edge I mean unconscious.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Endyo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Gotta boost and have that situational awareness End. I only use boost for those quick maneuvers. In asteroids I drift boost into a straight line. It's tricky at first, but you're a damn good pilot so you'll learn to use it to your advantage."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Zethos,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"If I'm a ""damn good pilot"" and regularly left as a bloody splotch on your average asteroid, then I don't think the average Joe is going to be much more successful."
starcitizen,3dxzax,wearetheromantics,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"You just started getting used to it. Hell I was flippin through those things all weekend. It's tough, but it's supposed to be. Adapt or die. Peeps are getting what they wanted, a sim. Maybe playing space sims and the like just have me used to this crap. I dunno."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Bzerker01,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:06 2015 UTC,It is called situational awareness.  Being aware of your position with regard to other ships and objects and knowing your ship.  What many have not noted yet or thought about is you still have the ability to have good control over your ship it just requires you to reduce your main thrust.  So if you want to reduce your chances of slamming into another object just check your position and speed.
starcitizen,3dxzax,DEEDEE-101,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"The situation that I'm aware of is that where I once considered how bland combat might be without asteroids, I now consider them to be unnecessary fodder that don't allow for the player to fly in the way they desire.  And of course those of us using keyboard and mouse don't have the advantage of analog throttle control.  But the important thing is that there was rarely ever much warning that dark asteroids.  There wasn't much to be aware of before and the only saving grace was one's ability to divert your ship at the last moment.  Now even upon realizing impending impact, you can't adjust in a way that avoids it.  You're relegated to slowing down even more in a very artificial way.  It's the equivalent of having speed bumps.  The new flight model should have sufficiently slowed the combat enough."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Hidesuru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Mate. It just seems to me that if you're playing around in an asteroid field both parties learn to slow it sown and keep alert, or someone is getting scraped off a rock somewhere.  The drifting keeps the flight model from being twitch and that is what everyone was expecting.  Twitch for FPS, non-twitch for fighter combat.   Im even more hopeful with what they appear to be doing with the gimbals.  If they are truly reducing the arc ranges and the movement rates that shows they really are listening and trying to remove the point and click twitch gunning."
starcitizen,3dxzax,iBoMbY,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:05 2015 UTC,"My problem is that there's all this stressing toward realism in the flight model and then you have a completely unrealistic environment to fight in.  I don't like picking and choosing realism, go one way or another because realistic movement doesn't work well for unrealistic environments.  Like if you had realistic car handling in Trackmania it would be terrible."
starcitizen,3dxzax,Kronok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that not all environments are going to be flooded with asteroids given how large the systems are due to be.  But realstically there will be pockets of them in certain systems.  My guess is CIG decided to create obstacle courses in the AC maps.    I for one believe that flight ops and flight combat should have realism as they are supposed to be skill based.  Otherwise you just end up with twitch FPS combat in space.  Thankfully that is about to change with this next update.
starcitizen,3dxzax,Vemaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"In my mind the ability to avoid obstacles was one of the reasons why maneuvering thrusters were so strong in the first place. At the same time though a lot of people have been wanting more drifting, more sliding, more momentum, and etc.  There will probably be more complaints about this if it goes live but I am expecting at least some tweaking before it does.   As a side note you must be liking the Avenger with its ability to now mount s2 guns on the wings!"
starcitizen,3dxzax,DEEDEE-101,3,Tue Jul 21 05:33:17 2015 UTC,"As a side note you must be liking the Avenger with its ability to now mount s2 guns on the wings!   I would like it if the REC system was on the PTU.  However, given the significant nerfs to the Tigerstriek it's more of a necessity than an bonus.  With 200 fewer rounds per magazine and wild inaccuracy (and the same fake spinup) it's nowhere near as effective."
starcitizen,3dxzax,RyuujinZER0,4,Mon Jul 20 15:15:50 2015 UTC,The accuracy I could live with if it was applied to other weapons but that damn spin up feels completely unnecessary.  Didn't know about the reduced ammo capacity though.
starcitizen,3dzvve,micDiz,13,Mon Jul 20 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"Felling the same way dude, SQ42 was my main attraction at the start. I have my fingers crossed for maybe the SQ42 trailer at citizen con on 10th october, I doubt we will the episode 1 then but if we did i think i would shed a tear."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Technauts,10,Mon Jul 20 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"Simmer, SQ42 is a LONG time away from now. I dont think we will see it this year."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Oddzball,10,Tue Jul 21 00:54:59 2015 UTC,Trying to maintain my hype because there is no chance it's going to come out this year.
starcitizen,3dzvve,Davepen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"I think December is still likely. SQ42 doesn't have all that networking code to worry about and CIG has had working AI for a long time now. now that the mo cap is done all they really have to do is get the animations done, which they have to do to get the FPS out the door anyway, and the locations."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Rumpullpus,13,Mon Jul 20 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry but realistically - SQ 42 might be done in some basic form by the end of the year - but in no way will it be able to go live to backers.  And trust me I'm not a defeatist in fact I get accused of being a white knight more than anything - but SQ 42 has next to zero chance of coming out this year, and I am ok with that but I know others wont be."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Cymelion,6,Mon Jul 20 23:16:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, there. I call early Summer next year.  I don't think it's an enormous issue to be honest. By the end of the year we'll be happy with large world, multi-crew, FPS to flight transitions, a more configurable drone-sim experience and many of the non-combat roles ready to test. Plus an outside chance of the PU alpha. We'll be hungry for the lore and the story but we won't be hungry for gameplay."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Bribase,3,Tue Jul 21 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"depends on how many different locations we will get in the first episode of SQ42 I think. if we have a large part of the story taking place on planets and stuff then you might be right, but if most of it takes place on a couple large ships (which I am pretty sure of) than its gonna cut down on a lot of the time needed to make it.   Like I said the AI is practically done and I suspect we will have all the ships needed for SQ42 done in a couple months since they started working on the large capital ships and things at the beginning of the year. really the only thing I can think of that they really need to work on for SQ42 is the locations and animations."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Rumpullpus,6,Mon Jul 20 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"It won't happen dude.  First they have to have functioning Multi-Crew and fix all the bugs within it and then they have to implement the animations and do extensive testing on it.  Also they have some of the locations done I am sure but many including the Vanduul related stuff still needs to be built and the polished.  I see it being mid next year at the earliest, I will be happier with earlier ecstatic even but in no way shape or form do I expect it to be before then. Not a slight against CIG just a realistic expectation."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Cymelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, for backers they're unveiling it in batches, couple missions at a time. I'm sure at least one of those batches will come in early this year, after all, the tutorial we have today is a SQ 42 tutorial. We literally already have a piece of Squadron 42 now."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Skarsten,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"It's gameplay and AI that's the drag factor to SQ42, I think. We need extensive testing to make sure that the FPS is rock solid (it being 40% or so of the campaign) and the AI is in a pretty bare bones state right now given that there will be no AI in SM for the time being. Not to mention the fact that they're still trying to nail down the flight models and armor/damage system for the single seaters.  5 months just doesn't seem anything like enough time to get it done. I wouldn't worry, though. There will be a lot to play by the end of the year anyhow."
starcitizen,3dzvve,Bribase,2,Tue Jul 21 00:59:26 2015 UTC,No - CIG are releasing SQ 42 episode 1 complete - not in sections.  This is not quite correct man - I wish I could write more but I am trapped at work and its busy as fuck. Taken me 30 mins just to type this.
starcitizen,3dzvve,Cymelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:03 2015 UTC,Maybe the mission packs that they were going to release seperately evolved into the three episodes. I don't remember.  I do know they are close. My reference to the Squadron 42 training (tutorial) was correct...
starcitizen,3dzvve,Skarsten,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"No, Squadron 42 will be released as a stand-alone AAA quality title. It will ship with around 20 hours of content (CR rationalized this after mentioning there is roughly 5 hours worth of dialogue alone, not including playing the actual game ie: reading/shooting/running/flying/talking/exploring/repairing). There will be episodic releases (Squadron 42 Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3) but each episode will be a standalone, AAA quality release all on their own.  There will be no slow trickle of content for SQ42 - when it's done, they'll launch and you'll just download the entire game in one pass.   So no - they're not unveiling SQ42 in batches - it'll be one complete, solid game file and you won't be able to play the game until it's 100% complete and released digitally."
starcitizen,3dzvve,P4ndamonium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:06 2015 UTC,"From memory each episode is around 20 missions, don't think they're releasing those 20 piece meal. Would be quite frustrating to only be able to play one level at a time. It's a bit of a different approach to the modules, they want to wow us with the full game rather than let us play with things before they're finished. Although the groundwork is quite far along judging by the recent leak. They've just completed the motion capture so they've probably still got a few months of work ahead of them."
starcitizen,3dzvve,CmdrTobu,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:30:00 2015 UTC,They said they would start motion cap last summer and that did not happen; they are at least 1 year behind and episode 1 by fall 2016 if you are lucky

He had his flash in the pan temper-tantrum?  and now what? His self aggrandizement aside, does anybody actually care?  And if not, is it still a win?  Or is it just sad man ranting and raving to himself?"

starcitizen,3dz6g6,hells_ranger_stream,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it is kind of a win.    If we consider his goal to have been to draw attention to himself, and to things he's associated with by extension, then he's definitely succeeded. If you run his name through Google Trends (link), then you'll see that the popularity of his name as a search term has spiked dramatically higher than it's been in a decade. Controversy draws attention.    Not all of that attention is going to be good, but there are a lot of people out there who are either going to be in support of him (whether they understand his goals or not), or otherwise indifferent enough to just ride another controversy."
starcitizen,3dz6g6,Koumiho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:24:57 2015 UTC,"So he had his 15 minutes of ""fame"" and fades back into irrelevance for another decade or more.  I guess anything is a win if you set your bar low enough."

I've looked at his new game. I don't want to say it's bad, but it really doesn't look good. There's no way it'd be able to stand on its own merits, so he's going to milk this thing for as long as it suits him. Unfortunately, we're stuck with him."

starcitizen,3dz6g6,mesasone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, ignoring him isn't going to make him go away. In fact, ignoring him works in his favour because he gets an unopposed platform from which to do his thing. On top of that, if the only side of it that's getting put out there is his, then anyone coming into it fresh is likely to only see his side, which could turn off potential citizens.    Saying that, doing the whole echo chamber thing on here about what he's saying isn't going to help a whole lot either."

With Chris not making appearances lately, and all the delays, I know that a lot of backers are getting concerned.  Also, due to HWMNBN the game has been getting a bit of negative attention of late.    All of this combined is probably what sparked this 10FTC.  I wouldn't doubt that they were thinking of doing this regardless of Cpt. LOOKATMYGAME but he may have been the catalyst for it occurring right now."

When it's folded up the ship would function a bit like the Nostromo in Alien, a commercial towing vessel, something like a truck that tows a trailer.

starcitizen,3e00qs,Revinval,2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:54 2015 UTC,What about the Herald makes you think it could be remotely effective either for combat or stealth?
starcitizen,3e00qs,TheNakedAnt,3,Tue Jul 21 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"Well I few key things actually I put stealth in quotes because with Ewar I would assume the ability allows you to reduce the strength or accuracy of enemy sensors/systems.  Combat because it has 3 size ""1"" gimbaled weapons aka 3 size 2 weapons. It is considered armored and said to be slower than a m50 yet has a massive engine system. Which means its either energy starved (yet it has the biggest possible power plant on a ""single seater"")or it has extra weight (armor).   Overall you would use your speed and ""fog of war"" to lure enemies or sneak up on them and unload one huge blast from your 3 size 2 fixed weapons.  Or bait them into meeting the rest of your fleet while you are out running them but making them think you are the one running away.   We will have to see how Ewar pans out but I don't see the herald being a fragile ship in the slightest at least for its size. The single seater skirmishes are going to be, in my opinion, where many odd ideas will become semi viable and if done right will make people feel like the universe is alive rather than other MMOs that are basically spreadsheets"
starcitizen,3e00qs,Revinval,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:31:00 2015 UTC,"Ewar, fast ship and sharp turns when decoupling effectively. Relatively small in tha scale of PU when facing the opponent and relatively big weapons if fixed. Imagine having your friend fucking up systems while you fly using decoupled mode as a way of turning suddenly and shooting the enemy. Plus signature can be pretty small I assume. So element of surprise. Plus radar jamming.  Overall, I think it can beat ships when in the hands of a very skilled pilot. If ewar works it will be even more efficient. All you really have to do is practice flying with it and taking advatage of those dual joysticks. Then shut down all systems while you drift to intercept (unless in quantum drive of course). We'll see how this pans out but I see Herald as an essential ship for pirate fleets."

starcitizen,3dzkb6,Zethos,5,Mon Jul 20 20:28:19 2015 UTC,saw someone on the forums state that he had one standalone and one completionist. so 2 scythes does not guarantee increased rarity... but likely does

starcitizen,3dzvlm,CITRUSURETHRA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:09 2015 UTC,CIG posted something a week or two ago talking about that specifically.

starcitizen,3dyxg1,Bribase,5,Mon Jul 20 19:26:55 2015 UTC,Literally impossible because what constitutes griefing varies so much from person to person.  For example I've heard people say camping jump point exits in lawless space is griefing where to others its just regular old piracy.   Then you have the people in this very thread who say anyone who is dick when they kill you is griefing but thats entirely subjective.

starcitizen,3dyxg1,blacksmithwolf,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"I always thought griefing was quite specific - basically it's when (generally experienced) players, or pilots in much more kick-ass ships, specifically target (generally noobish) pilots what should be safe space.  Jump point camping in null-sec is piracy.. because it's null-sec. There's no security there, so if you go there in a Hull A without any escorts.. well.. you'll wake up in a Hope and all your gear will be gone.  Is it actually that subjective?

starcitizen,3dyxg1,LochDhu,16,Mon Jul 20 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"This, sir or madam, is the most reasonable and indeed most pragmatic suggested feature listed here, and it would be insane for CIG not to include Casinos in the PU.  Consider the absurdity of including of Space Soda Jerk 3000 as a potential mini-game for the Starliner. This kind of minigame would've been right at home in Spaceship Warlock back in 1990, but does anybody really imagine they're going to be wasting time refilling sodas for NPCs on their space bus?   Casino gambling-- whether with NPCs or against other players (or a mix)-- would be a wonderful addition to the game. The rule sets for a huge variety of card games, crap games and table games have existed in software form for decades- sparing CIG from having to crack the 'is it fun to play' nut essential to any worthy mini-game. Wagering in-game credits in Texas Hold 'Em, Blackjack, Roulette, etc. would be a blast. (I spent hours playing poker in Red Dead Redemption as a welcome, slower-paced diversion from chasing down bounties and whatnot-- and the same would happen in Star Citizen.)  Casinos would become centers of ongoing activity in ANY city where they are included and could even be the primary recurring draw of a location once the novelty of exploring that location has worn off.   It is the promise of ongoing novelty, of unexpected outcomes, of the chance to walk-into-a-casino-a-pauper-and-out-a-prince, that would keep people coming back in game, just as they do IRL.

And yeah, I don't doubt it would be so much a technical challenge as an international legal and ""availability due to M rating"" issue.  The last 10ft Producers showed that the intent is to keep this game available to as large an audience as possible, so they will shy away from adult content.  That said, Chris has mentioned that he will include anything that he deems necessary to the game without worrying about what the rating will be. There's a disconnect, I think."
starcitizen,3dyxg1,LastImmortalMan,3,Mon Jul 20 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think they are only making sure the content is wide-audience for the S42 release. The PU won't be regulated and will allow for much more adult content.  We already have human trafficking, narcotic trades and use, prostitution, cultists, etc.... I doubt they will strip that content from the PU. Even just the player relationships, what is up with all of the hot-tubs everywhere? I am sure we will get some 'risky' content because of that alone!  A lot of the lore is already pretty much M+, the PU won't be rated so it won't matter. S42 will have an M rating as the highest though, they could probably get away with less because it is a military shooter and you don't need too many 'crazy' adult things to make it a great game."

And while there is a rudimentary black market, there is no way for non-pledged players to get a hold of these weapons. My hope is CIG is a little more creative in how they structure the game. This is all science fiction/fantasy, but if a sim is trying to reflect the real world, advantages like this are problematic. At least the sim could make the restricted weapons available with added difficulty. Is this too vague? Another example: inaccessible areas of a map. Often games (i'm looking at you Far Cry 4) wall off areas of a map until the character meets certain requirements. That's fine, but maybe find a way to be creative about it? In Elite Dangerous they could have, for instance, made permit required systems still accessible to your FSD, but spawned hordes of system police to shoot you down upon jumping in.

Since there will be a legitimate way to buy UEC from CIG themselves, I don't think this will be as big of a problem like in some other MMOs.   As for people buying stuff on the real world black market... that always happens too. Big transactions and dealers always get found out in the end and once the devs find one person who did it - it links everyone else and a massive ban wave arrives. There's actually already a way to do this in SC - you can give anybody your ship by just leaving it empty, if you wish. Besides, guild wars 2 has the account-bound / soul-bound system in place that even prohibits sharing items between characters (which is a real PITA) and it still never stopped people from just buying and selling gold in chat.

The virtual-joystick was perfected years ago and there is no excuses in 2015 to not have good mouse support for this, so no one needs to buy an expensive stick or even a cheap one.       Like most stick pilots, I just want actual controller parity, which is completely achievable if they don't do silly things like give one zero-order and not the other.

starcitizen,3dz8kx,Stupid_question_bot,0,Mon Jul 20 20:28:20 2015 UTC,The spread makes it ridiculously inaccurate after less than a second of fire and it takes a long time not firing for it to settle.. Not really sure what they were thinking with this one
starcitizen,3dz8kx,Endyo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:49 2015 UTC,It's certainly very strange compared to previous trends.

Even looking at their damage per shot for alpha-strike comparisons the Omni's seem rather useless now.  laser repeaters look good, the Avenger and Gladius nose guns look good, and the Mantis hypothetically looks good if you can actually keep a bead on a target with the new flight model."
starcitizen,3dz8kx,Dayreach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"I can tell you right now that the PTU Avenger and Gladius nose guns (and the Merlin's )are kind of crap in practice.

starcitizen,3dz8kx,ApatheticRabbit,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Their damage per shot was good when boated because it increased the likelihood that you would kill a ship with a few well-placed shots (tapping a cockpit twice as opposed to spraying repeaters all over the target). This isn't as much of a concern now that shield and ship HP have risen yet again, but it's definitely not a concern now that other, better weapons offer competitive damage per shot values while also having other benefits over the new Omni's."

It looks like boating Omnis on a Super Hornet still gives you a high alpha - 498 damage per blast - but their speed is now drastically lower. I guess they are more like cannons instead of sniper rifles now, depending on how you want to interpret ""cannon.""  Just out of curiosity you ever think about including a column for a weapon's common name, like ""Omni 6"" or ""Longsword?"" It might make it easier to read at first glance."

starcitizen,3dz8kx,scheherazade0xF,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well they do distortion (disruption?) damage. Which takes down shields and makes AI ships slow down a bit.

starcitizen,3e0pqg,knightedchaos,4,Tue Jul 21 01:44:23 2015 UTC,"I have a cutlass, not as awesome but if anyone wants to team up with that I'm down"
starcitizen,3e0pqg,stoopkid33,4,Tue Jul 21 01:46:06 2015 UTC,Yeah always need gunners and boarding crews for our cutlass's :P
starcitizen,3e0pqg,JamesSaga,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:03 2015 UTC,Well I am always willing to take people out on my 890 Jump when its implemented just get in touch with me when it is.  Although - Weapons will need to be checked at the airlock ...

I made that very obscure post a super long time ago... so uhh, we still on for that??""   Trust me, it's going to happen :p"
starcitizen,3e0pqg,Siphran,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"If I manage to build my rig in the near future, you'll be welcome on my Carrack. Be sure to wipe your feet at the door."
starcitizen,3e0pqg,Rand0mtask,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'm in a Connie Phoenix, and own a Carrack, too. I'll gladly take you out for a spin, hoss.  I'm Rand0mtask (zero for the O) in-game."
starcitizen,3e0pqg,worldspawn00,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"I've got a Freelancer, Constellation(Taurus, cause I'm cheap), Reliant, and a Cutlass that I'll be playing with once multi comes out, would love to have some crew.  Feel free to drop me a line and remind me when 2.0 comes out."
starcitizen,3e0pqg,Mipsel,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:19 2015 UTC,I´m certain that CIG will implement a way to directly join a game where multi-crew ships are flying.
starcitizen,3e0pqg,JelNirin,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:44 2015 UTC,if you want to fly a retaliator then pm me
starcitizen,3e0pqg,PieceOfCrowbar,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:06 2015 UTC,"You'd be very welcome aboard my Andromeda, hit me up."
starcitizen,3e0pqg,alge4,2,Tue Jul 21 09:43:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, if any of my IRL friends opt to join me, the'll get first pick over roles, but everyone will get a turn at everything, from launching the merlin to shield controls to piloting to commanding.  But i'm not sure when it launches if i'll have a full crew available so i'll probably need you to fill out the numbers anyway :P"
starcitizen,3e0pqg,Cplblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:36:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely sure you will experience multi-crew.  There will always be people hiring an extra set of hands.  That being said, I've got a Connie Aquila, Retaliator, and a few other ships (heh).  I welcome any assistance :)"
starcitizen,3e0pqg,xanif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:26 2015 UTC,"I have an Aquila, Starfarer-G, Redeemer, Reliant, Freelancer MIS, and Vanguard you are welcome to check out.  Though the first thing I'm going to do when I hand you the reigns of the Constellation is try to crash the Merlin into the bridge so you get sucked into space.  You are forewarned."
starcitizen,3e0pqg,mhordeuxlol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"I will need a gunner in my Freelancer MIS, you are all welcome aboard Sir!"
