secretsanta,3e32h7,alwayssunnyinLA,6,Tue Jul 21 16:07:37 2015 UTC,Love that you turned this into a photo shoot of Lego and other toys! Wicked jealous of the haul.
secretsanta,3e32h7,HellaciousHelen,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! Seemed like the least I could do to celebrate such a rad gift.
secretsanta,3e32h7,PurpleTulip9,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:14 2015 UTC,This read like the opening of a suspense/thriller and I should know I am a writer and a publisher LOL.  Nicely done!  I loved the creativity of your santa as well as the level of gratitude you gave to the game.  Bravo!!
secretsanta,3e32h7,sparklekitteh,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Aspiring writer here! That was the nicest thing you could have said :)
secretsanta,3e2bfk,twoandfortysix,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:38 2015 UTC,I got this from a Santa too
secretsanta,3e2bfk,triplefreshpandabear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:46 2015 UTC,Have you cooked anything from it yet?
secretsanta,3e0jfv,Betsy514,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:23 2015 UTC,Hurricane popcorn!! Good stuff. If you ever get the chance... try the Li-Hing Sour Apple candy or Li-Hing (Fresh) Pineapple. Sooooo gooood.
secretsanta,3e0jfv,XLBentoBox,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:50 2015 UTC,This gift combo seems incomplete without spam...
secretsanta,3e0jfv,HaikuMadeMeDoIt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:27 2015 UTC,WOW! Great box!!!!
secretsanta,3e0jfv,mommyofmany,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:14 2015 UTC,Just finished shopping for my giftee today and I get this heavy box on my doorstep - all the way from Hawaii!!!  Thank you!  I can't wait to try all the treats!!

secretsanta,3e2r9o,scooley01,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:06 2015 UTC,You can always send a small something now so they have something in time and then know there's something else on the way.
secretsanta,3e2r9o,txteva,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:51 2015 UTC,I have done this. I pre-ordered a video game for my giftee and I mailed them the receipt with the prices and sensitive info blacked out.
secretsanta,3e2r9o,k80k80k80,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"Oh that's smart!  That way you can still ""ship"" by the deadline...good idea!"
secretsanta,3e2r9o,TheOpus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"You can do that, but please message your giftee and let them know that it will be late.  Also, please do not mark anything as shipped until it has actually been shipped."

secretsanta,3e36c6,Animedingo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"This has been discussed multiple times. Not everyone posts right away and that's fine. They will be sent so many reminders to post their gift and if they never post, they will be banned from all future exchanges. It will not affect you if they take no action. However, if you would like to get your credit back before they post, you could submit proof that you sent something at redditgifts.com."
secretsanta,3e34jw,iisST1TCH,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Since there is not a hard shipping deadline for rematchers, sometimes it van just take awhile. Anyone who doesn't send a gift in a regulations exchange is banned from all future exchanges. If a rematcher doesn't send a gift, they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they are  ineligible to be rematched themselves in exchanges."
secretsanta,3e34jw,TheOpus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"I see, it's just kind of disheartening, it's like getting ready for a date, buying some flowers, and eating fast food alone an hour later."
secretsanta,3e34jw,TheOpus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I totally get it.  It SUCKS to not get a gift and we hate it when it happens.  However, the way that matching works is that if you are shafted in an exchange, an effort is made to pair you up with a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in.  That works really well."
secretsanta,3e34jw,StrangerinthaAlps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this anime exchange will go much better, I'm just sad. D: Thanks for the input and encouragement. :D"

secretsanta,3e34jw,Animedingo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:48 2015 UTC,If a rematcher doesn't send a gift...   Is that handled automatically or do we have to report it to a mod. My Simpsons rematcher contacted me but never sent anything.
secretsanta,3e34jw,BuddhasCat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:03 2015 UTC,The system knows.
secretsanta,3e20g9,screamadelica_IE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:06:47 2015 UTC,If you didn't get a gift did you mark no gift received?

secretsanta,3e20g9,colorvegas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:56 2015 UTC,I am showing that you did not report not receiving a gift for your Pints & Shot Glasses exchange. Please go back into the exchange and mark  No Gift. That should clear this right up.  https://redditgifts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200310139-Why-do-I-have-1-credits-

secretsanta,3e0sqz,SwissMss,9,Tue Jul 21 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that the delay in seeing small town gifts is because small town Santas are having to put in a little extra effort to make it special and personal.  I didn't sign up for this exchange because I have recently moved, but would have rocked a SS gift from the place I consider my hometown (population 1,000).  My sister is doing this exchange and is in a town of less than 300.  You're not alone!"
secretsanta,3e0sqz,PurpleEngineer,4,Tue Jul 21 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"I currently live in a small town, but I'm sending things from a large city (where I'm originally from) because my town is boring and sucks haha  I bet your giftee won't hate you! There are all kinds of great things you could do even living in a small town!"
secretsanta,3e0sqz,LucidDreamer18,3,Tue Jul 21 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"Just think of it this way, you are giving someone a chance to learn about your hometown, potentially a home town they haven't heard of before, which I think is awesome :D (big towns some people might have basic knowledge as to what it's like - from what they see in movies or on the news, or online) Every town has something to offer and they can't hate you for expanding their knowledge on where you come from :) I'm sure whatever you have planned will be great! I'm thinking next time this exchange happens I might just have to sign up because it does look like a lot of fun!"
secretsanta,3e0sqz,TheGingerPigeon,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:47 2015 UTC,I sending half on state and a little care of goodies and stuff locally made
secretsanta,3e0sqz,shar12mae,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"I'm from a small town. I think if you really put some effort into your gift,it could be more ""personal-feeling"" than one from a big city."
secretsanta,3e0sqz,tourguidebernie,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:12 2015 UTC,I would love to get something from a small town that hardly any one knows anything about
secretsanta,3e0sqz,lwhite1,3,Tue Jul 21 07:21:40 2015 UTC,"Of course small towns aren't in the gallery, yet. Farmer's market is only open on Saturdays."
secretsanta,3e0sqz,salydra,3,Tue Jul 21 13:00:57 2015 UTC,Nop I come from a place with 200 people ;) It is a lovely town with lots of culture still
secretsanta,3e0sqz,MissyC123,3,Tue Jul 21 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"I would have picked my beautiful college town, but I won't be back there until after the shipping deadline :( I think small towns with a lot of character are sometimes even more special and personal than larger cities. As long as you put in effort and got them something you feel is meaningful, I'm sure they'll love it! Hometowns come in all shapes and sizes :)"
secretsanta,3e0sqz,forensikat,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not from a huge town, and I'm doing it. I can't speak for everyone, but I signed up hoping to learn about my Santa's hometown regardless of how small or large it is.  I think the small towns give you a better chance to tell your giftee what your town is all about without them having any sort of preconceptions about it. However, that just means that it takes a little longer to put together the perfect items since you are creating a sort of narrative from scratch."
secretsanta,3e0sqz,likeomgjess,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"My town is not even a town- it's a ""census designated place""! We have local artists and craftsmen though."

secretsanta,3e0sqz,RadonOrchid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:08:50 2015 UTC,I didn't sign up simply because my home town is... too small. There are no shops where I could get them something unless there was a way to ship wine or Chinese food. They don't even have post cards.
secretsanta,3e0sqz,theLily,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:39 2015 UTC,.. your name. Hrm.  And yes... my town was too small too :(

secretsanta,3dzcvo,PurpleTulip9,2,Mon Jul 20 19:31:39 2015 UTC,Pens + Stationary 2015 has been my favorite! I got a ippy uppy kind of cards and ones with butterflies and sparkles.   Favorite so far!
secretsanta,3dzcvo,Kameiko,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"Mine would have to be the book exchange from last year. I was a poor graduate student, and for some reason I agreed to gift internationally. My giftee preferred hard cover books, and we had a lot of book similarities. I bought him some fantastic reads, and made him a bookmark since we were both Whovians.  We've been pen pals ever since, he's sent me cool postcards, and awesome stamps. I gave yet to make another friend like this from my exchanges.  All in all, the book exchanges are always my favorite. I love giving people books, sharing some of my favorites, etc. My giftees always seem to enjoy them, too. Makes me feel awesome."
secretsanta,3dzcvo,bellansa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"I have only been doing exchanges since Christmas, but my favorite so far was Colors- mostly because I was tickled that it was all hand-wrapped. :D  I could not pick a favorite based on content alone, most of my Santas have been awesome to me."
secretsanta,3dzcvo,SwissMss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"My Santa's have always been good to me. I kinda like giving more than getting, but with that said, I think that this Hometown one is going to be the best. My Santa has sent me a personal note asking a lot of questions about me and my preferences and kept in touch this last week. We kinda bonded so I will have to wait and see. Fingers crossed"

secretsanta,3dyi28,PurpleTulip9,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:39 2015 UTC,There's a calendar for that? Is it just for elves?
secretsanta,3dyi28,chiv,3,Mon Jul 20 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Nope! It's on the sidebar. It shows the dates for upcoming exchanges, but does not show what they all are."

I even find myself sometimes joining exchanges for themes that I know nothing about just to get involved!"
secretsanta,3dyi28,chiv,3,Mon Jul 20 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"It's just so hard to quit, man. I could pass up not participating in the Nintendo exchange... but the thought that somebody who participated in such a great exchange might not get a gift broke my heart. Like a dog in an SPCA commercial. I am weak."
secretsanta,3dyi28,chiv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:46 2015 UTC,I spent my whole lunch break today just picking up stuff for the hometown exchange. It gets even more addictive when you get into an exchange and it makes you want to represent!
secretsanta,3dyi28,lwhite1,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:45 2015 UTC,Oh God... there was a street fair downtown this weekend that reminded me of the hometown exchange. There was a compulsion but not as strong as the Nintendo one. Some lady made jewelry out of soda cans or something... lots of soy stuff...
secretsanta,3dyi28,chiv,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:25 2015 UTC,I just dropped more on the hometown exchange than any of the others. I got a little happy about that one!
secretsanta,3dyi28,lwhite1,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"I did too. I just spent my ONE day off running from store to store. My wife thinks I am nuts. On my day off, I just wanted to go see Antman and have a drink at Pussers. P.S. I still had a drink at Pussers (Annapolis)"

secretsanta,3dxsgv,pmf1985,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:39 2015 UTC,That's a good plan (I've done that before with delays) so they can mark they have a gift and takes a bit of pressure off you. :-)

secretsanta,3dxsgv,MFoy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"as long as they are in the know so they don't mark receiving ""no gift""   Actually, if they haven't received anything by the time that's an option... they really SHOULD report no gift. Even if OP (or any Santa) has assured them repeatedly that they're sending something, or it's been sent, the Giftee should report no gift. As long as OP submits proof of shipping, it won't affect them negatively."
secretsanta,3dxsgv,angelxox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"That is true, I didn't really think of that! In this case it sounds like it will be ok as OP is going to send something before the ship date, just not the main gift so the giftee can post it and then edit when the second package arrives."

secretsanta,3dylae,Typical-Geek,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:37 2015 UTC,ThinkGeek has some good geeky office supplies (staplers and the like) that your giftee might enjoy! I know I've seen Game of Thrones based items there.

secretsanta,3dwa7q,confessionsbee,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"This is the first round where I'm actually okay waiting with everything. Granted,  that's mainly because in just over a week I'm going in for a c section.  I normally put everything off until the last minute and I have apparently done that with the baby's room. I still don't have my hospital bag packed either.  Any other round I'd be checking multiple times a day to see if my giftee has posted their gift yet, this time I just have a ton going on."

secretsanta,3dwa7q,heatherlambka,3,Mon Jul 20 02:43:13 2015 UTC,/u/confessionsbee ...patience...uh...well is overrated with regard to Reddit Exchanges. I have patience in other areas...but the exchanges...not so much.
secretsanta,3dwa7q,drkatherine1,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"Not everyone posts their gifts in the gallery right away and that's fine. They will be sent SO many reminders to post their gift and if they never post, they will be banned from all future exchanges.  Lots of people retrieve their giftee's information on Matching Day and then copy it down somewhere so that they don't have to keep going back to the page. It's nothing to worry about."
secretsanta,3dwa7q,TheOpus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"if they never post, they will be banned from all future exchanges   Really? I didn't know that. Out of curiosity, I just noticed that I signed up to do rematching on 2 exchanges last year, and my giftees never acknowledged receiving their re-match gifts, and I had not submitted shipping proof. I do HAVE shipping proof. Is there any reason to bother submitting it now (a year later or whatever)?  It was for Keychains 2014 & Ties 2014."
secretsanta,3dwa7q,pmf1985,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:58 2015 UTC,Wait...giftees know when I go to their page? Because then I might want to apologize to some people for stalking.

secretsanta,3dwa7q,TheOpus,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:55 2015 UTC,My Arbitrary Day match never posted.  The worst part is that we had a lot of lengthy discussions and he was really awesome and friendly.  Then after I sent the gift he just disappeared.  I honestly worry about him.  It seemed so uncharacteristic.

Going to send my anime + manga another message later today or Wednesday if nothing is poster by then. He said he post it yesterday due to doing something. Which I was ok with. Hopefully he gets to it today.   My matches haven't pulled or contacted me or whatever since Monday and Tuesday. They just pulled, and that's it. I dunno, I'm the type that likes to communicate with mine, but not everyone is like that.  We must retain faith. It's only been one week :) <3."
secretsanta,3dwa7q,Kameiko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat with the santas. It's making me itch a little bit because I have to have them sent to a friend's house because I'm in the middle of moving and I don't want to send it to my current place because I don't know who will be living here and I don't want it sent to the future house because I know my SIL (who currently lives there) might open it - or worse her toddler might and I do not want him to get into my stickers!  I think, worse (for me anyhow) is waiting for shipping on the packages for my giftees. I'm sending them both two gifts, one on each payday within the period and the first batch for both are due sometime this week, but I want to know what they think! I was lucky and got two people who had been shafted in their last two exchanges and I am really looking forward to making them happy (I hope!)  Gah, why can't this all be instant!?"

secretsanta,3dtmca,beachkriscat,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:48 2015 UTC,"Adult coloring books is another name for them. They are far more intricate and detailed so it takes you a longer amount of time to complete them.  Sitting and doing an easy activity thats repeatative is really relaxing. For example, i took up knitting 6 months ago. And i just binge watch netflix with my boyfriend and knit, and its very soothing.   There are beautiful detailed coloring books for stress and adults, and theres also fun ones for adults that are more...risqué and adult in humor.

I found it when I was looking up their address on the redditgifts site just before I sent it out. Then I had to go get something else for them BUT I ended up trying the crab salsa myself and it was pretty damn good! It's something I never would have tried before and it's from my new hometown (just moved to this state a little while ago). It was a win-win for everyone! :D"

I ended up interested in Sailor Moon again after shopping for my Bookmarks giftee this year. And in the Yarn and Fabrics exchanges I learned about laceweight yarns (and all the pretty delicate things you can make with them) and some interesting embroidery techniques. I haven't picked either of them up yet (mostly because I'm a terrible knitter, my co-ordination sucks) but they're on the 'I will attempt this... Someday!' list."

secretsanta,3duvuc,Marysthrow,7,Sun Jul 19 18:31:28 2015 UTC,Are you able to purchase from the amazon.ca side instead of .com if the giftees address is in Canada? The selection isn't as on par but it might be worth looking in to since amazon has numerous warehouses to ship from in Canada
secretsanta,3duvuc,trex20,4,Sun Jul 19 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"It's for the hometown one, so most wouldn't be on there.... I'll just bite the bullet and ship regardless of how much it costs... this was the one exchange where I really didn't want to go with only inside the US as an option."
secretsanta,3duvuc,LanguageVirus,5,Mon Jul 20 00:04:49 2015 UTC,You can ship to Canada in a flat rate box; it's still more expensive but it isn't insane.
secretsanta,3duvuc,trex20,4,Mon Jul 20 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"I frequently ship packages from the United States to Canada through USPS.  As long as I keep the size and weight of the package such that I don't have to fill out the longform customs sheet (less than 12"" on each side and not more than four pounds), I've never had to pay more than about $20 in shipping.  I'm fairly certain that USPS will also honor their flat-rate shipping boxes on international delivery as well.  Unless you're sending enormous, heavy items you should not have to pay anywhere near $100.  Even with huge packages well over the weight limit the most I've ever paid was about $65.  (Which, I know, is still a lot, but I assume you were somewhat prepared for that if you chose international.)"
secretsanta,3duvuc,bellevuefineart,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that USPS will also honor their flat-rate shipping boxes on international delivery as well.   They're higher prices, but still flat-rate."
secretsanta,3duvuc,BrownSugarSandwich,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"USPS is your only real option. UPS and Fedex are super expensive going into Canada. Get a flat rate USPS priority box and declare it as a gift to avoid customs. UPS and Fedex both have to charge customs clearance fees and USPS doesn't.   I know, it's crazy that we can't ship things more easily from Canada to the US, or visa-versa."
secretsanta,3duvuc,bellevuefineart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:27 2015 UTC,Especially since Canada Post and USPS were both created/operated by Benjamin Franklin. You'd think that a universal delivery system between Canada and USA would exist by now.
secretsanta,3duvuc,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Mon Jul 20 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's Canadian customs. They have a high Value Added Tax on things coming in. As for sending things to the USA, I don't think customs really cares, unless it's drugs."
secretsanta,3duvuc,Pinalope4Real,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on the province, and what is crossing the border and where. Basically everything that comes across is assessed on a case by case basis. I personally don't mind since it helps keep the criminal activity low north of the 49th. In BC at least, customs is usually only a few hours delay. Everything just goes through an xray machine. I think some companies even have ""pre-cleared"" shipping options where you pay your import fees in advance and the item is declared by the sending company."
secretsanta,3duvuc,Pinalope4Real,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"From VA to Montreal it only costs me about $30 max. to ship, via UPS a huge box that weights almost 25 pounds at Christmas time. So I'm bot sure where tou are looking at shipping options, but they are cheaper than what you are stating. Also...any gift valued less than $60 is duty free."
secretsanta,3duvuc,AzbyKat,2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"ok, then I must have looked wrong... I did the ""calculate cost"" things on USPS, UPS, and FedEx and they all looked pretty expensive, like way more than I expected.... It'll get done though regardless. My husband was able to find international stuff he wanted to ship but everything I chose was like ""sorry, can't ship international"" even when I chose the international shipping stuff."
secretsanta,3duvuc,salydra,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:06 2015 UTC,Best bet is to bring the parcel in to the UsPS and UPS offices and have them let you know. I have never been able to come up with what they manage when I try the sites online.
secretsanta,3duvuc,Arlenemusume,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:11 2015 UTC,The calculate thing is always way off!
secretsanta,3duvuc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about those sites, but when I calculated on the Canada Post site, they list the most expensive method first, and you have to scroll down a ways to see all the options. I've noticed a lot of people get sticker shock because of that."

secretsanta,3dv8yu,TheGingerPigeon,3,Sun Jul 19 20:47:59 2015 UTC,You can always update the shipping information at a later time. You can also enter information for multiple shipments.  Please do not mark anything as shipped until it has actually been shipped.

secretsanta,3drce5,TheOpus,10,Mon Jul 20 03:54:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, if you are going to return them, I would just do it and I wouldn't mention it to your gifter.  I mean, whether he gets you something else or whether you get you something else, it all ends up the same.  And this way, his feelings don't get hurt or he doesn't end up feeling bad."

I would much prefer not to know, as I would A. Feel bad they didn't enjoy their gift B. Be stressed out with the idea of getting them an alternate gift when I didn't do well the first time. They would probably rather you use the gift credit to get something you want for yourself anyway, otherwise they wouldn't have bothered with the gift receipt in the first place."
secretsanta,3drce5,mrsfunkyjunk,5,Sat Jul 18 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Don't tell them.  That honestly seems like a rude thing to do.  If you exchange it, just do it (although I think that's odd).  Why would you want to make someone feel bad? Just exchange it if you want.  And, know that at least some stranger out there tried to make your day better."
secretsanta,3drce5,Kameiko,4,Sun Jul 19 06:29:36 2015 UTC,"See what you can do with the gifts. I got a book during the book exchange that I didn't care for and just donated it to my local library. If you can do something like that then go for it. Just don't simply return it becuse it's not your taste or already have it. Unless you really have to. I didn't even tell my Santa. I just said thank you and posted the books.  Edit: to clarify, it's one of three books I got. I liked the other two, but this book I've gotten before; and did not like it."

secretsanta,3drce5,drkatherine1,0,Mon Jul 20 02:52:51 2015 UTC,Usually if you return to Amazon the will notify the buyer and credit them. I got something in the teacher exchange that arrived damaged. I had to go to the person who gifted it and tell them.
secretsanta,3drce5,Kigurumix,5,Sat Jul 18 19:19:00 2015 UTC,Not if the item is sent as a gift.    You can return it for amazon credit minus the fee to ship it back if you use UPS.  I have had to do this with Christmas gifts from family before.

That works really well.  Your original gifter will be banned from all future exchanges.  And if a rematcher doesn't follow through, they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they become ineligible to be rematched themselves in exchanges."
secretsanta,3dmpbn,PurpleTulip9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"What exactly is a good known gifter?  I consider myself a good known gifter as I have gone above and beyond for all exchanges.  I always submit proof of mailing and I get good feedback.  However;  I have one that never posted she received her gift.  One who did not post a picture but a lax statement and two international that either haven't received them yet or just has not acknowledged.  So, what would I be?  a known good gifter or a gifter with giftees that don't post?"
secretsanta,3dmpbn,TheOpus,2,Sat Jul 18 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"A known good gifter is someone who has previously followed through on their end with exchanges.  It is not based on gift scores or giftees posting or anything like that because gift giving and receiving is a subjective activity.  Matching someone to a known good gifter isdone to try to prevent someone from being shafted twice in a row.  It is not perfect, but it works well about 98% of the time."

I've been trying to convince my Mom to join RedditGifts, but my Stepdad couldn't fathom why I would want to spend money on a gift to a stranger on the internet.    I got my mom to help me at least, and we spent a day visiting antique shops to find a Disneyland themed gift and then hit up the craft shop for bookmark materials.  We had a ball!  Once we were finally wrapping up the gifts, my stepdad said, ""I was really against this, but seeing how much fun you two have had putting these gifts together, I get it now.""  Sometimes the adventure of finding a gift is the real gift."

Then I skim through all of them just to get an overall idea of what directions I might go in.  Then one by one I do my good natured stalking.  Sometimes that will yield some additional info that I can use to find that perfect gift.  Sometimes, I have found ideas for some of my other giftees while searching for another one.  I made a private wish list to dump Amazon gift ideas into so I don't forget them.  After I have all my gift ideas into that private wish list....I then go and decide between them...and then purchase all of them, and hit the send button.  It takes me about 5 hours for 3 exchanges.

This time round I'm doing something personal for my giftees So I have just sent them something small to start with, As I won't have the gifts finished until closer to the shipping deadline.

secretsanta,3dkphc,hyphenatorwilla,3,Fri Jul 17 01:30:37 2015 UTC,Anyone else tempted to keep the polish they bought for their giftee? I kept looking at them and going oooh shiny! So I bought myself some cheapy new colors.    I hope my giftee likes what I sent...
secretsanta,3dkphc,Oscarlet,3,Fri Jul 17 02:25:18 2015 UTC,YES. The struggle is REAL.
secretsanta,3dkphc,slimpickins2148,2,Fri Jul 17 02:34:39 2015 UTC,I may have bought myself a couple glitters......they were on sale...I pretty much had too
secretsanta,3dkphc,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Fri Jul 17 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"I found some amazing stuff when I was shopping for my match. I had to hold off because I don't want to buy something that my santa might have! I am so excited to see what they got me. I'm no crazy picky about my polish, so I'm gonna be over the moooon with whatever comes in the mail <3"
secretsanta,3dkphc,Oscarlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:30:28 2015 UTC,Me too! I have some stuff held in my cart for later though.
secretsanta,3dkphc,deadange1,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:52 2015 UTC,"Hah, yes! I may have to get her only things I already own. :-p To be fair we have very similar likes when it comes to colours, so she'd probably be happy with that. :-)"
secretsanta,3dkphc,knoekie,2,Fri Jul 17 07:36:41 2015 UTC,somehow I always get matched with girls.. but for the nailpolish one I had a guy :P  (he asked for stuff for his gf. so I could still go girlie shopping)

secretsanta,3dk6qd,vampedvixen,4,Thu Jul 16 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"I stalk my giftees, but none of my Santas have ever revealed themselves, so I haven't been able to stalk them! One day though!"
secretsanta,3dk6qd,LePond,3,Fri Jul 17 03:59:01 2015 UTC,I totally do if they reveal themself :)  One of my giftees actually added me on fb. and we sent eachother messages sometimes.. I reminded her about this round of exchanges and we're both doin international nailpolish so she could end up as my Santa this time :)
secretsanta,3dk6qd,knoekie,2,Fri Jul 17 08:18:18 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, but not often. If they sent something truly phenomenal, and provided their username, I'm more likely to go look. But with a lot of people shipping directly from vendors now, I don't know most of my Santa's usernames."
secretsanta,3dk6qd,LucidDreamer18,2,Thu Jul 16 23:32:04 2015 UTC,Most of my giftee's only join and post for the exchanges and it's maddening! I have so little to go on sometimes because they have no post history. So yes I stalk the bejebbus out of my Santa's and giftees too when I can hehe.
secretsanta,3dk6qd,DarkfireMoon,2,Fri Jul 17 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"If they tell me who they are, then yes I do! If I can (cos I like the credit in the 'from' part of the gallery posts, I do tell my giftees who I am after they get their gift! or comment on their posts!"
secretsanta,3dk6qd,Jayke1981,2,Fri Jul 17 10:39:14 2015 UTC,"i do that with my Arbitrary day Santa, because she put her nickname in the package, was awesome because we have the same age and a lot of common interests. so i figure out why she nailed it so much with the gift she send me :D"
secretsanta,3dk6qd,Arlenemusume,2,Fri Jul 17 12:52:35 2015 UTC,I tried once. Never found them. I'd be a terrible Missing Persons Investigator.
secretsanta,3dk6qd,Gman_1995,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:06 2015 UTC,I've only been the recipient for one exchange so far and they didn't have any submitted posts or comments.  I think I stalk my giftee enough that it's only fair to learn about my Santa too.  (Is it weird that I'm commenting on this post since you were my giftee?)  Stalk away!
secretsanta,3dk6qd,PurpleEngineer,2,Fri Jul 17 00:17:23 2015 UTC,"Woot! By the way, that painting you drew is beautiful and mesmerizing. I've never really been a fan of modern art, but there is something just oddly magical about that one."

secretsanta,3dk6qd,Kameiko,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. Most I ever check is their Amazon wish list if they have one. I think that's the closest I get. I mostly just stick with direct messaging on reddit gifts.  As for posting their username. I only add it to the part where it's optional if they provide it when I receive their gift.  You're not creepy :)."
secretsanta,3dku52,Oscarlet,9,Fri Jul 17 02:12:00 2015 UTC,"The recommended amount to spend is $20 (with the exception of the zero credit exchanges), but the goal is to send a thoughtful gift.  If you would like to be a rematcher, maybe take a look at the zero credit exchanges that are still accepting rematchers and see if one of those would work for you."
secretsanta,3dku52,theLily,4,Fri Jul 17 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, $20 is still the recommended amount.  You can find it in the faq here."
secretsanta,3dku52,knoekie,4,Fri Jul 17 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"The recommended is $20, though it's just a recommendation."
secretsanta,3dku52,mastapetz,3,Fri Jul 17 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"I sometimes ship gifts in 2 parts and it could be that my giftee posts after the first part (which is only half of the gift), so this could also be the case..  Oh and 0-credit exchanges are less (like stickers), so you could always rematch for those"
secretsanta,3djq10,shira21,3,Thu Jul 16 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have been sent and have also mailed nail polish within Canada. It is not crossing the border so there should be no forms to fill out declaring what is in side the box. This is just my personal experience,  I did not know it was not allowed but at the same time I've never had an issue doing so."
secretsanta,3djq10,TheGingerPigeon,3,Thu Jul 16 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've always just thrown a bottle in a bubble envelope, wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put two stamps on it and away it went. Did this just last week actually. They sent it back saying parcel rates apply, I repackaged it and threw on 3 stamps instead of 2 and it was successfully delivered today!"
secretsanta,3djq10,FuzzySkittles,2,Fri Jul 17 00:56:41 2015 UTC,Most places don't allow regular people to ship nail polish. The post office only allows agents (usually businesses like Amazon or even nail companies like OPI) to ship nail polish. They have to have specific certifications in place and I'm assuming some type of liability insurance which then allows them to ship it. My giftee is in Ireland so I'm just going to have to find a company that is either in that country or ships to there to get her gift. It makes me sad as I can't be as creative or give what I really want as I have to shop from what selection the company has. Sorry about you not being able to ship what you got for her ( it's probably awesome) but maybe you can find it or something comparable on Amazon that will ship directly to her with no postal issues. Cheers and happy Nail Polish exchange
secretsanta,3djq10,SoulofCocoa,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:28 2015 UTC,Yikes! I just picked up some local nail polish and was going to post it this weekend.   After going to the USPS site and seeing no nail polish internationally it looks like I'm going to have to change my plans and look for a local company in my person's country.
secretsanta,3djq10,Wysom,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish they would have put this in the description when you sign up for the exchange. I mentioned this in the megathread when exchanges were being announced...nail polish is restricted for a reason, but it sure makes these exchanges hard."
secretsanta,3djq10,PeachBelle524,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Nail polish can be shipped domestically in the USA by ground.  Ask for an ORM-D sticker at your USPS retail location, or specify ground.  Source: I'm a USPS window clerk."

secretsanta,3djq10,Space_Cranberry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:46 2015 UTC,yeah I didn't know you could only ship nail polish by ground.  My package is going to be a very slow cross country donkey ride to the East Coast.
secretsanta,3djq10,Oscarlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:00:38 2015 UTC,Oh apparently it is because it is flammable.
secretsanta,3djq10,Oscarlet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:01:29 2015 UTC,Maybe order via Amazon and have the package shipped direct to your giftee?

secretsanta,3dio4z,anabellee83,10,Thu Jul 16 16:10:02 2015 UTC,I accidentally ordered something from China for my anime/manga giftee. Could take a month to get to her. Oops.
secretsanta,3dio4z,smilenowgirl,8,Thu Jul 16 17:26:24 2015 UTC,At least you did it early :)
secretsanta,3dio4z,salydra,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Agreed!
secretsanta,3dio4z,zils,5,Thu Jul 16 18:18:15 2015 UTC,I did this also.. But from Japan. Won't be there until the 9th of August. Oops. I ordered on the 13th.
secretsanta,3dio4z,smilenowgirl,3,Thu Jul 16 22:24:53 2015 UTC,Should...should we tell them?
secretsanta,3dio4z,wulfychick,7,Fri Jul 17 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"LOL, I wouldn't worry about it ;)  2 of my gifts are gone out.. but the other 3..yeah, not even close :)"
secretsanta,3dio4z,Sleezeballer,4,Thu Jul 16 16:16:52 2015 UTC,Don't feel bad my Santa has yet to pull my info yet for my exchange
secretsanta,3dio4z,sillygirlsarah,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:02 2015 UTC,I think my giftee gets like 10 of those messages a day cuz i checked them all the time to make sure i didnt read it wrong or something. I finally started taking screenshots.
secretsanta,3dio4z,OeRnY,4,Thu Jul 16 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"A gifted is notified only about the initial pulling. After that nothing, but they can look at the individual exchange page and the dates you pulled updates to whenever you last pulled the info."
secretsanta,3dio4z,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Ohhhhhhhh thanks for the info!
secretsanta,3dio4z,OeRnY,3,Fri Jul 17 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I just bought 50% of the gifts I need to deliver. Haven't found something fitting for my anime match yet. Although he clearly told me what he wants,  sort of.   I am just lazy this week xD"
secretsanta,3dio4z,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Thu Jul 16 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't found anything for my anime match yet either. I have a few ideas of what I want to get, but I first need to check the local store that just opened up~ I know they'll have a lot of stock since it's two quite popular shows, so I should be good with finding stuff. :) I feel kinda bad for my santa, I think I'm gonna be hard to shop for ;"
secretsanta,3dio4z,Kameiko,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"Haha! Yes, I also think getting something related to my interests is quite a challenge. Well at least if you are from Germany since most of the stuff never made it into here or are licensed without anything happening in here.  Since I also need to shop for a very popular show, I guess I will find something fitting very soon."
secretsanta,3dio4z,OeRnY,2,Fri Jul 17 08:18:08 2015 UTC,I think I'll be hard to shop for because I have most of the stuff I want. I'll be super stoked for whatever I get. My Santa has been totally awesome so far <3
secretsanta,3dio4z,Kameiko,2,Fri Jul 17 13:02:57 2015 UTC,Lazy is acceptable :P i just keep seeing all the awesome gifts and i keep having to check dates.
secretsanta,3dio4z,zammies,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:38 2015 UTC,I hope mine does. I ran out of characters in the first box.
secretsanta,3dio4z,Paralily,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"I tend to stop writing if I happen to see that I am talking about stuff not related to the original topic.

secretsanta,3dio4z,theladydisarray,2,Fri Jul 17 08:21:25 2015 UTC,"It works for you right? Dos that's a good thing. See I have an entire anime room devoted to anime and one bookcase of ""nerd"" things. I had to put links to what's there, so incase of doubles. Also, for interests purposes. Then I said what I want to get into, what do they like, and don't hesitate to contact me. It got a little crazy. I'm such a weebo (or however you spell it)."
secretsanta,3dio4z,theladydisarray,3,Fri Jul 17 12:05:01 2015 UTC,One of my gifts has gone out but the other will probably run to the deadline getting it together.   Some are just more time consuming than others :)
secretsanta,3dio4z,AnotherRandomPervert,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:36 2015 UTC,Yea this is for the Nintendo exchange. The other 3 will be easy... i hope
secretsanta,3dio4z,Kameiko,4,Thu Jul 16 18:18:02 2015 UTC,A quilt for the nintendo exchange? Ahhh your giftee is lucky! :)
secretsanta,3dio4z,Kameiko,3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:09 2015 UTC,Lol .. lap quilt .. I just recently got into quilting and this seemed like a great way to test out a technique I learned before I start my large Nintendo quilt for myself.
secretsanta,3dio4z,knoekie,2,Thu Jul 16 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"aw that's so cool! I'm gonna tell myself that my Nintendo santa is like, coming up with a super great idea even though they haven't pulled my info yet lol."

secretsanta,3djmws,Kigurumix,4,Thu Jul 16 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"When you marked you gift as not received you had done everything you needed to complete the exchange, that is why all the steps are crossed out.

I'm sure he/she just closed their account rather than try. I'm not bitter, it's just incredibly disappointing. I'm glad the system works most of the time."
secretsanta,3ddmc5,Sucht2,5,Wed Jul 15 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"If a rematcher doesn't follow through, they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they become ineligible to be rematched themselves in exchanges.  It is my experience that most of the time, when people don't follow through, it is rarely malicious.  Sometimes, life just gets in the way.  Anyone who does not get a gift will be matched to a known good gifter in the next exchange that they participate in."

secretsanta,3ddmc5,TheOpus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:31 2015 UTC,There isn't a hard shipping deadline for rematchers. It's just as soon as they can.
secretsanta,3ddmc5,Arlenemusume,3,Thu Jul 16 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"some SS really sucks, but is cool to know who some people sign in like rematchers, because they dont recieve any gift for that.  Rematchers youre awesome !"
secretsanta,3ddmc5,LittleMissBitchFace,3,Wed Jul 15 13:21:14 2015 UTC,I know the feeling. 2 out of three of the exchanges I have done have been duds. First rematch was a dud too. However my latest one (A-Day) has apparently shipped something so I'm hoping for something :)  I also did two rematches but with a limited budget so I hope my recipients liked their gifts
secretsanta,3ddmc5,LittleMissBitchFace,3,Wed Jul 15 15:25:20 2015 UTC,Ooooooooooh I have a little hat
secretsanta,3ddmc5,Willowx,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:40 2015 UTC,If you weren't aware it is because you are an elf (possibly due to the rematch gifts you sent). :-)

Kind of bummer when this happen. Gave it try this again on four exchanges if same thing happens, I will not be doing any more exchanges.

secretsanta,3ddmc5,lucy_inthessky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, I got a SS that sent the gift weeks late...and then the gift couldn't even be shipped to the APO address.

Hoping I get rematched.  Disney is my favorite one."

One person sent me a used, size large, smelly rattlesnake shirt from Florida for the tshirt exchange.  I'm a small girl and my SS was from PA.  Luckily, I got rematched for that one.  I'm hoping to get a rematch for the Disney one."
secretsanta,3ddmc5,MistaWrek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"I got rematched for the first time during the most recent arbitrary exchange (my first match never pulled my info).

Arbitrary Day 2015 was my first redditgifts exchange and I got a dud Santa that didn't even pull my info. Darkness came for me... Then, I got rematched and my new- the real- Santa was excited about being matched and ready to go. They did a good job paying attention to my interests and picking things that I may like.  I'm a numbers guy and when I saw that there was a big chunk of folks that didn't have a confirmed gift, I signed up to be a rematch Santa after gifting to my first match. Some people sign up for the wrong reasons and others really want to give and receive. And it's nice getting something in the mail."

secretsanta,3de9at,StanleyMk2,9,Wed Jul 15 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"This might not have been intentional. Sometimes, shipping companies and/or vendors have additional fees that the sender didn't know about.  There can also  be import taxes and things like that.  I would put a note in the ""Notes to help your Santa"" section of your profile and explain the situation.  Your gifter will be sent a notification that there has been a change and will hopefully read it.  But right now, it  is up to you if you want to pay the fee to get your gift."
secretsanta,3de9at,sweetsweetloretta,6,Wed Jul 15 16:55:11 2015 UTC,Did they ship from the Disney Store? The shipping in the US is usually free from the online store (if you reach a certain amount/ use promo code) BUT it's crazzzyy expensive if you send outside the US. A friend of mine (in Canada) had to pay 64$ c.o.d because of duties even though the sender paid for everything.

Please NEVER mark something received if you have not received it, this is against the rules. If you mark it 'not received yet' and the gift arrives, the 'not received yet' checkmark will be deleted automatically when you post your gift. Waiting too long to mark (not) received can get you banned. Your santa will not be in trouble if you mark 'no gift yet', unless they cannot submit proof of shipment."

The approximate scheduling is in the FAQ that is linked on the sidebar.   Rematching is random and it is possible that you would get matched to someone who would not necessarily be a good match for your products. You would need to be willing to send them something that works with their likes and dislikes if that is the case.
secretsanta,3d9g9o,DivaJen,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:13 2015 UTC,I think it's very likely that your rematchee would just feel fortunate to have you and wouldn't mind the wait. There isn't a strict deadline on sending rematch gifts either.

Or, do you have someone you trust that would be able to ship them for you once you get the person's information and make a decision?"
secretsanta,3dbrhy,starlightwhereyougo,3,Wed Jul 15 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Some people just do not reply to messages and I have no idea why.  Some people don't realize that they have a message right away, so I like to give them plenty of time.  That being said, if I don't hear back, I take that as an invitation for a free for all and I act accordingly."
secretsanta,3dbrhy,TheOpus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"i thought the same, especially considering the account is only a few months new to reddit although they had sort of updated their reddit gifts profile. that being said, i hope they appreciate what they're about to receive for their cube decorations. :)"
secretsanta,3dbrhy,heeeeellooooonurse,2,Wed Jul 15 01:25:41 2015 UTC,Another slick trick is googling their name and city for social media presence. I've found every match on other sites.
secretsanta,3dbrhy,heeeeellooooonurse,3,Wed Jul 15 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"did that too and ended up with the same pic from their profile, pretty  much."
secretsanta,3dbrhy,theladydisarray,2,Wed Jul 15 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"If its facebook, instagram, Pinterest or such you can see the things they like and get a better idea... Maybe lol. Some people are locked like knox and you have to pick fun generally appealing things."
secretsanta,3dbrhy,theladydisarray,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:44 2015 UTC,"that's basically what i did, minus the access to additional and helpful info. i'm a bit of a taskmaster by nature, so i'd like to get at least an inkling of what to look for besides something of a specific color, especially if it's not a ""colors"" thing. don't mean to continuously harp on it, but i think people should communicate and/or put a bit more thought into it when they provide their preferences."
secretsanta,3dbrhy,dandan97,3,Wed Jul 15 01:45:10 2015 UTC,Everyone does exchanges differently.  What might come natural for one person might not for someone else.  Some people just are not comfortable putting a ton of personal information about themselves out on the Internet.  It doesn't mean that they're not a great gifter and a great participant.
secretsanta,3dbrhy,chiv,2,Wed Jul 15 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man and here I feel like i'm sharing too much info or making it seem like I expect too much from someone, lol. I just like to be thorough- I feel like my matches are a bit tough....the nail polish one isn't going to be as exciting as I wanted- they said they don't like glitter polish and I am the glitter polish queen. and my nintendo one...well...they're like ""I'm open to receiving anything nintendo"" so uh...I guess....I'll figure something out....  tl;dr I feel your pain. Last round of matches I did (which involved arbitrary day 2014) my one giftee wanted like, computer parts...so i bought the one thing off their wishlist that wasn't a computer part...."
secretsanta,3dbrhy,Arlenemusume,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"haha, thanks for the feels. i was beginning to wonder if i had unrealistic expectations or something. good luck finding anything nintendo ;)"

I kept wondering if I was sending the right thing to the right person so I must have checked and rechecked and double checked the packages a million times. lol"
secretsanta,3d9zx0,vampedvixen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean! When I do multiples I just try to start right after matching and do one at a time, so the first is shipped or at least almost done before I start on the second. Works for me ;)."

My town lends itself really well to this exchange.   I guess I can always rematch if this for some reason didnt go through?!

secretsanta,3d8xy8,RuthMargaretB,2,Tue Jul 14 23:05:16 2015 UTC,We figured it out and fixed it BUT I have to sit this round of exchanges out due to the error. It's sad! I love love loved the ones I signed up for. :(

secretsanta,3d8xy8,jsingh0928,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:39 2015 UTC,No. It's a caching issue.
secretsanta,3d8xy8,nijoli,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:14 2015 UTC,Good to know -thanks! :)
secretsanta,3d9wyz,starryeyed_cj,5,Tue Jul 14 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, message your giftee. They probably had a space in mind when they signed up and it is probably something along the lines of what you are thinking already. Communication can be super helpful. I like to send a list of questions with a few random ones mixed in so it's not too obvious what I am thinking. Hope that helps."
secretsanta,3d9wyz,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:03 2015 UTC,What sort of questions do you ask?
secretsanta,3d9wyz,ameliapondlives,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"I always ask about allergies, just in case. Even in an exchange where it might not make sense at all. Sometimes it's fun to throw in an extra treat and occasionally someone has an allergy or sensitivity to something that ends up mattering in a round about way. For example, if you have a Disney Parks loving giftee that is allergic to pineapple, a Dole Whip air freshener might not be so nostalgic for them.   I run through some basics like favorite colors, scents, etc. I try to ask what kinds of designs appeal to them. Modern, feminine, minimalist, art deco, etc.  I ask who makes up their family? Is it just them or do they have a spouse and kids. Any pets?  I ask if they have had any recent big life events or if there are any right around the corner. Marriages, babies, promotions, graduations, training for a marathon, etc.  I intermix these with some that are more specific to the exchange itself. So for Decorate Your Cubicle, I might ask them to give a short rundown of what they do at work and/or if there is a place in their home they manage household affairs from. Do they wear a uniform or a certain style of business clothes. Do they believe in organized chaos, or that everything should have it's place. Do they prefer useful things or items that are just for viewing.  Does that help a bit?"
secretsanta,3d9wyz,MeishkaD,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:01 2015 UTC,That is awesome. Thank you :D
secretsanta,3d9wyz,ameliapondlives,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"i think the best you can do is ask to your giftee, dont be shy. in case your giftee dont answer your message (i be there before), maybe you can send some pencils, a nice desk calendar, or a wall one. or one of those pop up note dispensers with some cool shape (i have a cat one) or a tape dispenser with shape (3m have a cool ones and other cool office stuff ;D) or a Cork board with some nice pins. a funny stappler. a cool pencil case, some pictures, an antistress ball... that´s come to my mind now, i hope can help you ;)"
secretsanta,3d9wyz,Arlenemusume,2,Tue Jul 14 19:19:19 2015 UTC,I'm very excited about this exchange! I have a window that opens to the main hallway and that is what I intend to decorate.
secretsanta,3dbm5r,RAnDomBandGirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:31:27 2015 UTC,The mods can't approve your shipping proof.  That's an admin thing.  Why can't you submit it?

secretsanta,3dbm05,vampedvixen,3,Wed Jul 15 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"We don't keep track of things like that, so it's hard to tell.  Also, there aren't really many exchanges this time around where something could be delivered digitally, so it's not a surprise if there aren't very many."
secretsanta,3d8jvz,mitchnana,7,Tue Jul 14 10:01:39 2015 UTC,"So you're shipping from the UK to the US?  You can get a pricing estimate from Royal Mail here.  You want to keep around 1kg max otherwise it starts to get very pricey.  Anything over 2kg is handled by Parcel Force and will cost you a small fortune.  Make sure to read up on what is and isn't allowed to be posted there.  The main things that are prohibited are meat, fruit and vegetables and alcohol. Also mark the package as a gift on your customs sticker, it'll help your giftee avoid any import taxes.  Standard will usually take about 1 week to get there.  Economy will take 1-2 months as it goes by boat so best to avoid that one if possible.  If you have any more questions let me know.  I've posted a few gifts off to the US."
secretsanta,3d8jvz,KungFuPup,4,Tue Jul 14 10:32:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply :D  I will check out that website and I'll probably ask my post office some questions about sending gifts :P Thanks again
secretsanta,3d8jvz,afrael,4,Tue Jul 14 10:36:51 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about envelope posting, sometimes you can send a small box as an envelope as long as it's not big/heavy, and cut the shipping cost in half!"
secretsanta,3d8jvz,afrael,2,Tue Jul 14 11:26:43 2015 UTC,Oo thanks for the tip :D This is my first exchange so probably just a bit nervous

secretsanta,3d7zh8,LazyFiiish,7,Tue Jul 14 13:10:54 2015 UTC,Go down the history route. Find some old books about the town or photographs of the area. Or even better you could be cheeky and send him an aerial photograph of HIS house. That'd confuse him 😝
secretsanta,3d7zh8,beautyoftheday,0,Tue Jul 14 07:10:28 2015 UTC,This made me LOL
secretsanta,3d7zh8,Lord_Firestorm,13,Wed Jul 15 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"Turn it into a hometown pride exchange. Get him some glasses/mugs from a local restaurant, an autographed picture from a local politician or minor celebrity like a DJ. Bake him a pie from locally sourced fruit, or buy him some fresh jam from a nearby farm.    Here's the way I see it: I dropped out of this exchange because as much as I like to share my local flavor I don't see any reason to have souvenirs from places I've never visited. I would much rather have my morning cup of coffee from a mug with the emblem of my local college (and alma mater) than from a city with which I have no emotional connection. He might be disappointed at first to find that his match is from his own home town, but now you get to treat him to the best it has to offer and perhaps introduce him to something he has overlooked."
secretsanta,3d7zh8,AnneFrankenstein,-8,Tue Jul 14 06:09:26 2015 UTC,An autograph from a local politician or shitty DJ?  If you handed me one of those it would be in the trash can as soon as i saw one.

secretsanta,3d7zh8,ClassicCarLife,3,Tue Jul 14 08:59:04 2015 UTC,That is something I have considered.  We aren't in a HUGE city but it a large one.  There are some VERY nice high end restaurants.

Or try to find some really interesting things to do thst a normal person wouldn't do in your hometown.  You also have a unique opportunity to do a scavenger/clue/geocache ish present hunt for them since you can access the same places and know where to do things.

secretsanta,3d5car,demonnibri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:00 2015 UTC,I almost always date guys who paint their nails.  Completely unintentionally just happens like all the time.  The one boyfriend I had who didn't told me that he wish he could and wear big jewelry.
secretsanta,3d5car,randomthoughts91,5,Wed Jul 15 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"I got a very unique giftee for the hometown..she likes horror movies and all horror figures , she's into all strange stuff . im wondering if the giftee's preferences or personality should have any influence on the gift I choose for this exchange ? I mean I am in arabic country , so everything I had in mind was either food or art or souvenirs .  What should I do ?"
secretsanta,3d5car,BrownSugarSandwich,6,Mon Jul 13 18:28:04 2015 UTC,Are there any local places that are seen as haunted or creepy? Some pictures of that place would probably match their interests.
secretsanta,3d5car,randomthoughts91,2,Mon Jul 13 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"Wellllll , im actually a coward when it comes to these stuff, I would seriously get scared and stressed out just by reading ghost stories. ... horror is not my favorite part at all , now do you see my problem :( ?"
secretsanta,3d5car,MeishkaD,6,Mon Jul 13 19:00:51 2015 UTC,If you want to PM me your country and rough location I would be happy to do a little research for you so you don't have to creep yourself out. I was only able to sign up for two exchanges and the research is one of my favorite parts. If you give me some of the ideas of things you were already thinking of I can even see if there is some cross over.
secretsanta,3d5car,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Mon Jul 13 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe a friend could take pictures? Also where I live there are books published about the area's spooky stuff, maybe there's a book available? You can just ask the staff at the store to pick one they suggest."
secretsanta,3d5car,randomthoughts91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Thats probably what I will do , I just feel bad for sending something that I didnt even see or read , and don't even like , too bad , I really wanned to make this one special :( I feel so bad"
secretsanta,3d5car,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Mon Jul 13 19:17:44 2015 UTC,You can always include some of the stuff you were planning to include. Add a card with a picture of your favourite local attraction! Send them a message too and ask if they would like some local snacks and see if they have any allergies. Explain that you want to include local stuff and try to include something that matches their interests as well :)  You can do it!
secretsanta,3d5car,randomthoughts91,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"I will do that , I actually messeged her and she is so sweet , I just feel like based on her interests that she won't relate to the items I can send"
secretsanta,3d5car,Michlerish,5,Tue Jul 14 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I finally got an adult AND girl match for the first time!  :D  Sounds silly, but it's exciting to send to someone I understand a little better than teenage boys haha"

secretsanta,3d5car,rinstinct,3,Mon Jul 13 17:26:44 2015 UTC,Is it possible to drop of my box of goods to my giftee's address? I live less than an hour away.
secretsanta,3d5car,rinstinct,11,Mon Jul 13 18:41:18 2015 UTC,Please do not drop anything off in person (even if your giftee is not home or if you don't make contact) unless you have contacted your giftee and specifically received their permission to do so.  This is covered in this section of the FAQ that is linked on the sidebar.
secretsanta,3d5car,PeachBelle524,2,Mon Jul 13 19:02:59 2015 UTC,Thank you PeachBell524 and TheOpus for the replies. I made sure to send a message asking for permission. I'll just mail it if my giftee descides to decline.
secretsanta,3d5car,Rinablood,6,Mon Jul 13 19:32:10 2015 UTC,Message them and ask first. Offer to meet up at a Starbucks or something not at someone's house. I was in the same situation but my giftee seemed hesitant so I didn't push it and mailed it instead.
secretsanta,3d5car,LadyBosie,3,Mon Jul 13 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"So excited, got my match and noticed their good game taste, but my info hasn't been pulled yet, so a little nervous, but its only the first day."

It'll be fun spoiling her with gifts again. It's perfect, because there was something I was thinking of getting her for that exchange that will be perfect for the Jewelry exchange as well.    ... now it's off to shove the cat and boy over to make some room, so I can dream of gift ideas and what's to come~"

secretsanta,3d5x69,Jayke1981,6,Mon Jul 13 19:50:19 2015 UTC,Hmm... So you gonna send 'em the sequel to whatever you sent last year?
secretsanta,3d5x69,Lord_Firestorm,7,Mon Jul 13 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"hmmm, I hadn't thought of that! lol"
secretsanta,3d5x69,LucidDreamer18,7,Tue Jul 14 07:36:45 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool, actually. If you get them again next year, the two of you will just have to become best friends."
secretsanta,3d5x69,midgetpepper,4,Mon Jul 13 21:03:34 2015 UTC,Whoa! That's pretty weird! You'd think they would've put some sort of parameters so you wouldn't get someone you've matched with before.
secretsanta,3d5x69,Lord_Firestorm,4,Mon Jul 13 20:45:13 2015 UTC,A Gifter I had for a recent previous exchange had me for a different one too before. You'd think with international I'd have less chance of repeats - not that I'm really complaining as I know what NOT to get them! lol
secretsanta,3d5x69,Saviour19,3,Mon Jul 13 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"If you're in the U.S., International may end up narrowing your pool. If you selected PLUS it could be narrowed even more. That's how some people end up with the same giftee for multiple exchanges in one set!"

secretsanta,3d5x69,jpanda820,2,Tue Jul 14 12:25:44 2015 UTC,It would also depend on the algorithm used for the matching. It may bias things in a way that would make it more probable than expected based on the number of participants.

Rules change, and we cannot all be up to date at all times.  As for online stores, amazon has an amazon.ca, and often amazon.com will have decent shipping costs (not always, so keep checking!), so that's always an option."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,LadyBosie,9,Tue Jul 14 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"The most common metal allergy is nickel. Very high quality sterling silver and at least 18 karat gold are safe but white gold often actually contains nickel. (common mistake it's actually platinum that's the safe white gold looking metal). Anything that says hypoallergenic, nickel free or surgical steel should be safe. Avoid anything vintage since there's almost no way to determine it's mineral content. For actual brands I would recommend Simply Whispers because they are pretty darn dedicated to the purity of their stuff."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,ReginaAstrum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:32:21 2015 UTC,Surgical steel is not nickel-free. I wouldn't assume surgical steel was safe without asking the person if they can wear it.
secretsanta,3d6wm1,BatzCountry,0,Tue Jul 14 03:07:34 2015 UTC,"I'm also allergic to ""nickel-free"" earrings.  Yes.  When in doubt stick with silver or gold.  Even target sells cute cheap earings in silver."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,aitiologia,5,Tue Jul 14 04:02:12 2015 UTC,I would try to message them and get further clarifications on restrictions.
secretsanta,3d6wm1,Lord_Firestorm,10,Tue Jul 14 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"You might look into non-traditional materials, as well. I know you can gets rings and bracelets and stuff made from wood, leather, stone, bone, and so forth. You might also ask your match about other kinds of jewellery: Brooches and other items that don't make skin contact are probably safe, so the only question is whether your match would wear it.    If you're lucky enough to have a match who likes green, maybe consider jade as the primary material? Local legend has it that jade has protective qualities: If your jade bracelet breaks, it's because it prevented your arm from breaking, and so forth. Better yet, I've often seen it at a super affordable price!"
secretsanta,3d6wm1,hallipeno,3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. When my silver earrings started making my earlobes itch, a friend recommended bone or titanium. I bought simple hoops in the latter and no more itch (though they do get super cold and hurty in the winter)."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,Lord_Firestorm,2,Tue Jul 14 05:51:13 2015 UTC,"OOH! I <3 titanium. Good call!    There's a potential tip: Titanium doesn't set off most airport metal detectors, so if someone travels frequently it's more convenient than having to remove all your jewellery."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,BatzCountry,3,Tue Jul 14 06:00:27 2015 UTC,"Check out this earlier thread for info and suggestions: https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/3bo1xu/very_important_if_you_are_doing_the_jewelry/  If your giftee has given you specifics, it's best to try to stick to those (though, you can message your giftee to ask about specific other metals).  Please note, though... if a sensitive skin person says they can wear ""silver,"" they mean ""sterling silver"" (.925% pure silver) or ""fine silver"" (.999% pure silver). That's not the same thing as ""silver-plated"" or ""silver-tone."" And don't be fooled by anything that says it's ""sterling silver-plated."" There's no such thing. That stuff is just plain old ""silver-plated"" metal."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,fae-morrigan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"I also have skin like this, I'm allergic to most metals on the skin, I break out and get rashes.     The better choice is gold or silver as they are organic in nature, we can't make it. Most allergies like this is because of the nickel content in the metal, its a cheap additive.   You can ask if hypoallergenic is okay for them as well, as I understand gold and silver jewelry can be spendy.  Etsy could be a good place to search."
secretsanta,3d6wm1,Lord_Firestorm,4,Tue Jul 14 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"Ahh... what do you mean by describing silver and gold as ""organic""? M eyebrow is raised as a biochemist because neither one is an allotrope of carbon, as a consumer because neither is grown without chemicals, and as a layman because neither is generated through biological processes.    I think that sounds kind of snarky, but the point is: what do you mean by ""organic?"""
secretsanta,3d6wm1,fae-morrigan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"Well, i was meaning that organic by that there isn't a way to hand create gold or silver.

I thought it was just wishlists and that was it. I'll look into that! If they're anything like the wishlists where you can have items from other websites, then it will definitely be the go-to. Won't have the wedding for a couple years so we have time to save up. So many things to do. Ick! One of my friends had a wishlist set up on a travel site, and people were able to buy activities (like dinner for two, or tickets for two for a nature tour) or help pay for the flights and stuff. I thought that was pretty cool."

secretsanta,3d72ll,afrael,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:27:26 2015 UTC,"I did 2 Elf-matchings this round and I messaged both my giftees (1 already responded).. Both my Santa's picked up my info (no messages, but I am already really happy with this :))"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,AmberWoo,4,Mon Jul 13 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited as well, I'll receive some money next week and I'm planning on spending it all in my exchange. It's the first time i'm doing this so i'm realy hyped to see pictures of my giftee with my exchange. So exciting -. I live in a turistic town here in Brazil, so there's a lot of stuff I must buy, I already did a list of things to put in my exchange, there are so many cool things, and can't even select which ones are the best x.x"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,Hotezer,3,Mon Jul 13 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"This will be my first exchange on redditgifts, I got someone in North America, I think this will be great so I can send them a lot of Western Australian goodies."
secretsanta,3d5ieo,mBellaz,2,Mon Jul 13 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'm struggling with this one - my match is from a great American city, I'm from a shitty backwater slow paced market town in England!   We don't have any special foods, unless you count a type of duck that is now nearly extinct. I might just go with sending some British sweets :)"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,takhana,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who misses England like mad, trust me, the stuff you can buy in your local tesco is awesome and much appreciated in places where it's not available!! Special love for hula hoops, magic stars, monster munch, dolly mixtures..."
secretsanta,3d5ieo,inthetealeaves,2,Tue Jul 14 01:56:55 2015 UTC,"I'm having a similar thing! I'm going for a mixture of country, city, and village based stuff. So some welsh gifts, maybe some Swansea City merch,  postcards,  and maybe some copies of my village magazine. We've also got a small indie comic based in the city, so I might send a second copy of that.  Basically, it can seem like there's nothing until you just get scribbling down a list. Postcards and magazines are a good option, as well as British sweets."
secretsanta,3d5ieo,quantumpenguins,2,Tue Jul 14 02:02:59 2015 UTC,I wish I was your giftee!  I've been to Swansea once (it was verrrry cold) and think your idea is awesome.
secretsanta,3d5ieo,laridaes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm just glad if got a couple of cheap ideas this year that won't break the bank XD. And yeah, we're not known for our sun..."

secretsanta,3d5ieo,takhana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:45:04 2015 UTC,Awesome! Hope it goes well for you :)
secretsanta,3d5ieo,quantumpenguins,2,Tue Jul 14 11:19:52 2015 UTC,Ha!  I just bought Berger cookies and Old Bay chips this afternoon too.  I'm also going to throw in some Haribo gummy bears and a City Paper.  It's also perfect timing since Artscape is this weekend.  I can't wait to find some great Baltimore stuff.
secretsanta,3d5ieo,MsSarahR44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:12:23 2015 UTC,A newspaper is an excellent idea!  Thanks for saying that.  I'm gonna throw one in mine!

secretsanta,3d5ieo,cuddleswithkoalas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:15:59 2015 UTC,This exchange is shaping up to be quite amazing. I'm really excited to send my giftee a box filled with Northern California sunshine (figuratively) . My Santa messaged me and is in one of the two places that I'd love to visit so I'm beyond excited about that!
secretsanta,3d5ieo,vampedvixen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying exploring my hometown through this exchange. I only just moved to this city too, so it's an adventure for me too. I accidentally bought something that my giftee was allergic too, so I ended up eating it myself and was like ""Dude, this is goooood. I should buy this more often."" lol! :)"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,Prob_Bad_Association,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited about this exchange!  At first I was unsure what to do because my giftee turned out to be in the same state as me, so its kinda pointless to send them some California sunshine, I'm sure they've got plenty of their own!  But then I started brainstorming ideas and was running around town a bit trying to figure out what would be feasible, and I think I came up with an awesome plan, hopefully I can make it all come together and my giftee enjoys it!  I'm gonna have so much fun working on it for the next couple weeks though!"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,laridaes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"That is why I liked this one!  I chose international for this one, and my giftee is an awesome Redditor, so am super excited to get going and finding stuff for her. :)"
secretsanta,3d5ieo,captjaneway,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:51 2015 UTC,Ya I'm planning on sending the same to my gifted on the west coast hurray me being unique

secretsanta,3d5ieo,TorchIt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty pumped to put together my hometown package, but my giftee didn't give me much to go on as far as her likes and dislikes.  In fact, she copied the same text into all three fields.  There's a plan brewing, but it would be nice to know if she's allergic to peanuts or hates art or something."

secretsanta,3d6uva,Kigurumix,3,Tue Jul 14 00:12:06 2015 UTC,Lol  :)
secretsanta,3d6uva,TheOpus,5,Tue Jul 14 00:14:04 2015 UTC,Your Santa will be sent an email letting then know that there has been a update to your exchange preferences.  You can see the last time your Santa checked your preferences I your exchange page and see if it was before or after you changed it.
secretsanta,3d54re,vampedvixen,4,Mon Jul 13 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"I had that kind of dream last exchange... LOL.  I remember it cost me something like $200 to ship, but if I could fit everything into these other boxes (that had to be a certain weight..not under, not over), then it would only cost me $40.    shakes her head  I thought I was going insane."

secretsanta,3d641l,weffey,2,Mon Jul 13 20:41:19 2015 UTC,If you pick up your match before the emails are sent out then you won't get an email.
secretsanta,3d641l,Kigurumix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:26 2015 UTC,Does that mean who got me for a match will/won't receive an email?

secretsanta,3d641l,WattledPenguin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:33 2015 UTC,They will get the email notifying them that they have been matched if they haven't looked at their match before the emails go out.  There is no connection between you picking up your match before emails going out and your Santa getting the matching email.
secretsanta,3d4u4i,BlondesGift,0,Mon Jul 13 15:12:46 2015 UTC,Suits you

secretsanta,3d7rdl,tralfagarlaw,3,Tue Jul 14 04:21:03 2015 UTC,the recommended minimum is $20 but the most important thing is to send a thoughtful gift.  It is here in the FAQ.
secretsanta,3d7rdl,rozzie1982,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:22:13 2015 UTC,Read $20 is minimum
secretsanta,3d5vvy,zils,11,Mon Jul 13 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"Usually it is a good idea to see how your giftee feels about used items. Some people are cool with it and some not so much. But in this instance, what you're suggesting sounds fine (and really nice)!"
secretsanta,3d5vvy,TheOpus,3,Mon Jul 13 19:45:45 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll message him and try to find out without giving the present away.
secretsanta,3d5vvy,salydra,3,Mon Jul 13 20:15:17 2015 UTC,It sounds awesome! That's really nice of you! =)
secretsanta,3d5vvy,deadange1,4,Mon Jul 13 20:46:27 2015 UTC,"Used gifts can be excellent, and you are is a situation where I would give the thumbs up: It's something of value, not just junk, and it meets the giftee's likes/dislikes."
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Kameiko,4,Mon Jul 13 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"That's an amazing gift, and I'd be ecstatic to receive it (if I didn't already have a 3DS), I can't imagine a Nintendo fan not being happy with that."
secretsanta,3d5vvy,cuddleswithkoalas,3,Mon Jul 13 20:29:16 2015 UTC,Dude! If it's scratched or even cracked I'll still take it. The fact you're gifting a hand held is amazing on its own!
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Easyandfree,3,Tue Jul 14 00:41:44 2015 UTC,If its in a good enough condition that you'd buy it at a GameStop then I would say absolutely. A lot of electronics are purchased used and make wonderful gifts.
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Easyandfree,3,Mon Jul 13 21:04:54 2015 UTC,Make sure it's clean!   I got used books that were sticky and stained and it grossed me out.
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Jayke1981,5,Mon Jul 13 21:12:00 2015 UTC,Oh my. No this is clean. I'll even clean it again!
secretsanta,3d5vvy,vampedvixen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:44:22 2015 UTC,"haha, good! That's the only thing I'd really look out for."
secretsanta,3d5vvy,insanearcane,2,Mon Jul 13 21:47:04 2015 UTC,I would say its ok. as long as condition is fine - then as long as giftee is happy - its a win-win!
secretsanta,3d5vvy,lcarosella,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:18 2015 UTC,Something cool to do with a used present would be to buy something new to go along with it. Like a game or an accessory. Then you have something old and something new :)
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Daedalistic-Outlook,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:53 2015 UTC,That's an amazing gift! What a wonderful surprise.
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Caeleste,2,Mon Jul 13 23:38:47 2015 UTC,If they have mentioned really wanting something and you have it...go for it.
secretsanta,3d5vvy,Arlenemusume,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"Zoinks!  You're amazing.  I know that I suck at even reselling stuff, because I have a mentality of ""I want this item to find a happy home where it's loved"", so you're logic strikes a chord with me.  In fact, this makes me feel [slightly] better about some gift ideas that I have for my Nintendo giftee, where I was thinking, ""But if I got something that expensive, I'd feel somewhere between awful and first-world-problems-awkward.""  tl;dr -- /u/zils, you're my hero.    *Edited, because I sounded like an asshat somehow gaming the system here, due to my poor word choices about ""selling stuff"" in the context of gifting stuff."
secretsanta,3d3271,johnothetree,30,Mon Jul 13 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'm still hoping my Santa, or rematch Santa, will send me my gift. Maybe one day.  Congrats on finally getting yours :)"

I was really bummed out when I never got anything, wish I had just signed up for a rematch anyway. That and my recipient never really posted anything about my gift, it was a really crappy experience for my first time on Reddit Secret Santa. Hopefully my next one will be much better. Anyway, congratulations to you!"
secretsanta,3d3271,gbuck97,8,Mon Jul 13 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"my first year i didn't get anything from my original santa, nor my rematch. just keep on tryin!"
secretsanta,3d3271,gbuck97,3,Mon Jul 13 04:18:22 2015 UTC,Is this your second year? It would really suck to get no gift two years in a row.
secretsanta,3d3271,gbuck97,9,Mon Jul 13 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"third, actually. last year's santa got me Skyrim and The Walking Dead Season 1 game from Telltale Games. Was wonderful because i built my desktop that Christmas as well, so it fit perfectly :D"
secretsanta,3d3271,halcyoncmdr,2,Mon Jul 13 04:24:59 2015 UTC,"Cool, did you mention you were building a computer in your description or was it just an amazing coincidence."

secretsanta,3d3271,pmf1985,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"I thought rematches were guaranteed original senders. They've been verified as having sent a gift previously, specifically to prevent this occurrence."
secretsanta,3d3271,jarrettbraun,2,Mon Jul 13 06:27:29 2015 UTC,My first participation was as a rematch santa so I don't think they stop anyone from signing up.
secretsanta,3d3271,pmf1985,2,Mon Jul 13 07:32:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. There's nothing to guarantee it... though there's no benefit to anyone to sign up for rematching and not follow through (they signed up knowing they wouldn't get a gift), but they don't get banned or anything if they don't follow through. Which is kind of a bummer. I've had rematches that never even pulled my info before."
secretsanta,3d3271,gbuck97,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"Makes you wonder if some of them are just completely naive and think a rematch will get them a bonus gift. Like many in this thread, I was once shafted by both my match and rematch. From reading around the last year or so, it just seems more common than it should...   EDIT: I will add that the positive experiences have made it well worth sticking around. My last recipient loved my gift and it puts the biggest smile on my face."
secretsanta,3d3271,hhairy,5,Mon Jul 13 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Always always just sign up for the rematch! If your original santa DID in fact send something, or sends something late, they can prove it by providing shipping proof. If you DO end up getting two gifts (from your original, and your rematch santa)... then pay it forward some time by signing up to be a rematcher. It all comes around in the end. But don't wait around on someone who ""swears"" they're sending something. Just go for the rematch next time :)"
secretsanta,3d3271,vapingcarrie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Yeah I'm going to be more skeptical next time lol.

I'm trying to get a bit creative with my gift, as if it was someone on the other side of the country I had some California specific things I was thinking of sending, but since my giftee is also in California, they probably wouldn't be as excited about those.  I'm thinking of maybe focusing on some local legends/lore and wierdness that is the far north of the state instead.  My thought is that since they're in a bigger city, and I'm not, they may not have ever been exposed to some of our wierder legends up here and might be amused."
secretsanta,3d5kmj,Prob_Bad_Association,3,Mon Jul 13 19:06:01 2015 UTC,That would make for a really fun gift.

secretsanta,3d72u9,Kigurumix,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:27 2015 UTC,Totally USPS.  Flat rate boxes are amazing and they come with free tracking and like a 2-3 day delivery time frame.  They also deliver on the weekend.
secretsanta,3d72u9,TheOpus,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"Ditto what the others have said about USPS. Don't forget you can buy your postage online and save time and money. You can also order FREE priority boxes from the USPS website. Yes, totally free...and they ship them to you...for free!  If you are sending something oversized (box is more than 18"") or bulky. I strongly recommend FedEx Ground. They are cheaper and faster, to most locations, instead of UPS."
secretsanta,3d68f2,dinosnoores,7,Mon Jul 13 21:09:02 2015 UTC,I've had that problem with a giftee previously. I usually put a lot of thought into my gifts but their username/ reddit activity took all the fun out of it for me so I just bought them something from a wishlist that met the $20 expectation and was done with it.  I didn't spend as much as I usually budget for the exchange so I rematched.
secretsanta,3d68f2,ReginaAstrum,5,Mon Jul 13 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"Hey u/dinosnoores! I'm sorry that you're not thrilled about the person you're matched with, however, we really can't rematch you once matching has already taken place. Who you are matched with is who you are matched with. Please keep in mind that you chose to give a gift for the sake of gift giving only and your gift may enlighten someone else’s life. If you find that your giftee is difficult to choose a gift for, please do your best to follow the information they have provided in their likes and dislikes."
secretsanta,3d68f2,salinger007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:14:04 2015 UTC,thank you. I'll definitely still get them a gift based on their likes in the gifting description :)
secretsanta,3d68f2,LucidDreamer18,6,Mon Jul 13 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"You can't change your match. I've been in your shoes. I bought a nice gift I was pretty certain they would really like (it even won awards), and treated it as I do all exchanges. It was hard not to let them know how ignorant I thought some of their comments were, but I have no regrets. I did the right thing, I just had to keep reminding to myself that that is all that matters at the end of it all."
secretsanta,3d68f2,inthetealeaves,3,Mon Jul 13 21:15:44 2015 UTC,thanks. I'll try my best to give them a good gift based on their likes in the exchange description. I really do love the concept of secret santa on reddit so that's what matters.
secretsanta,3d68f2,afrael,4,Mon Jul 13 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"I've had that problem before. I had a giftee that wasn't posting offensive stuff, but just things that made me think, ""please don't ever reproduce.""   They also never ended up posting my gift, despite posting all of their other ones :/  Just go with it. It's just, what, two weeks that you have to think about them? Then you never have to see their posts again.  And, remember, even if you're not posting offensive stuff, I'm sure there have been people in the past that don't agree with you. Everyone is different :)"
secretsanta,3d68f2,Kigurumix,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"I've had a similar experience - a giftee whose posting history was full of really cruel comments and stories about other people's bodies. I still chose a thoughtful gift, hoping that a small experience of kindness might help her feel kinder. Hurdle is the right word for the experience of shopping for someone like that though!"
secretsanta,3d68f2,mrsfunkyjunk,3,Mon Jul 13 23:23:02 2015 UTC,"Just my personal opinion: I try to keep in mind that however ignorant or reprehensible they are, they're still people who are more than their opinions on one subject. They probably have friends or family, and even if they don't, they probably have struggles getting through life, just like you or me. I find it's more productive to feel sorry for them than be mad or sad. IMHO they cannot be a balanced and happy person if they are angry at 50% of the world population. They deserve just as nice a gift as someone who is angry or depressed at him/herself, even though that's more easily relatable."
secretsanta,3d68f2,fortnerd,2,Tue Jul 14 07:51:31 2015 UTC,Please don't suggest that they troll their giftee.

secretsanta,3d5g8p,MeishkaD,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:28 2015 UTC,Really just comes down to personal preference. There really is no wrong answer.

secretsanta,3d5g8p,ReginaAstrum,3,Mon Jul 13 18:07:58 2015 UTC,It's also perfectly acceptable to have it sent to you and message your giftee letting them know things might be a bit delayed due to shipping. It's also good to keep in mind that many Etsy shop owners list items that have already been made. I once ordered a clock from a shop in England and it arrived safe and sound in less than two weeks. Contact the seller and ask how long the whole process will take and then you can decide from there. Happy gifting!
secretsanta,3d5g8p,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:30 2015 UTC,Often because of processing times I have etsy ship directly to the person I just put a note to the seller that it's a gift and please remove anything that would display the price/ billing information. A lot of etsy sellers will offer at that point to include a note.
secretsanta,3d7h7q,Distressed_DarkSkin,10,Tue Jul 14 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"There is not a requirement that anyone have an account for any length of time, nor is there a requirement for a certain amount of account activity in order to participate in exchanges.  Some people just aren't active on reddit.  It's fine.  We have lots of people who have made a reddit account solely to do exchanges and they do just great.  You should still send this person a gift.    Also, please do not PM anyone a link to your giftee's information.  Thanks."

I wouldn't make it your main gift, but it would be a nice additional gift. Maybe even throw some spare change in there for them or something?"

It's also not a horrible idea to hint at something maybe a little more expensive in case you santa is very generous. I once had a santa that got me Mario Kart 8 which was $60!  Amiibo are a good choice, they're cheap and fun!"

At the end I put down some ideas about about how my santa might look for gifts. I'd recommend going for the exchange, I've made the mistake before of really thinking about it and then regretting not going for it ;). I did plus international because I though that'd be fun, potential to be expensive though ;p Can also update your bio during the exchange so I wouldn't let not knowing to write straight away off the bat put you off.  Said at the end I enjoyed cooking for fitness so something like a local cookbook would be nice or maybe some gifts like wallets etc from a local market. Maybe there's local produce or maybe the areas famous for producing some product or movie star or cartoons etc."

Well, I'm excited for both, but for some reason I'm just really looking forward to hometown.  I can't really afford international shipping though, so I stayed within the US and am hoping I at least get someone who doesn't live in the same state as me, it would be pretty funny if we ended up from the same area..."
secretsanta,3d2839,Prob_Bad_Association,3,Mon Jul 13 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"I think I saw someone in a previous hometown exchange got someone in their same city, so they asked to take them on a date all around their city to see some of their favorite spots. It sounded like quite the adventure!"
secretsanta,3d2839,brokenboomerang,2,Mon Jul 13 02:36:35 2015 UTC,I signed up for Minecraft so my son and I can spend some time putting together and amazing package (it's one of the only things that inspires him to craft). A little bummed at how tight money is so I can't do more (especially comics :'( gah) but still really looking forward to this!  Edit: I broke down and signed up just under the wire. There are so many great comics I want to expose someone new to!
secretsanta,3d2839,maekattt,2,Mon Jul 13 04:20:37 2015 UTC,I signed up for cubicles and hometowns! Hopefully some of you overseas folks like my Australian things! I'm pretty excited by these two exchanges!

I dropped Hometown and Comics & Graphic Novels, the first because although I like to send people local products from Hawai'i I don't really care to receive similar items.    I'm doing the Nintendo exchange as my first international exchange, because I realize that different regions receive different memorabilia and games, although since the games are usually region locked I'll avoid sending any software."

Anyways, I also ended up putting a ton of information in my likes/dislikes form. I wanted to be helpful to the person who gets me as their giftee. Is having lots of information a bad thing?"

secretsanta,3d2839,angelxox,2,Mon Jul 13 02:39:15 2015 UTC,Oh! Okay! I always get a little worried if I put in too much information on these things. I'm always scared that I might intimidate the other person.

You can always message them, I did this with the snacks exchanges because my giftee asked for things popular in my area and they lived like 20 minutes away from me.  Have you ever lived somewhere else that you could shop for online to send them things for there?  Just think outside the box and I am sure you will do great."

secretsanta,3d5s0a,Superdupertroopers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:56 2015 UTC,I would message your giftee. See if there is a region of the state they haven't been to! Maybe there is something unique in your town that isn't in theirs? Maybe a gift card to a restaurant or museum in the area?
secretsanta,3d5s0a,salydra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:56 2015 UTC,Many are suggesting event tickets or other activity themed items. Maybe a gift certificate to a favorite restaurant?

He was either going out of state for vacations, or rotting in front of the TV at home.  Maybe your Santa has never been in your city.

Chances are, unless she was oblivious to her environment her entire young life, or never visits her mother, then she probably knows the local area as well as I do. I'm stumped. I like to gift fairly anonymously, but I'm seriously considering contacting her to find out what she would prefer me to do."
secretsanta,3d5s0a,salydra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:25:30 2015 UTC,"Do a scavenger hunt!  You can buy actual items that she'd like that maybe don't necessarily have anything to do with the exchange, but leave clues or something at each of your favorite locations.  Just contact her and make sure she'd be okay driving out there and would want to do it."
secretsanta,3d1s9c,darkpyr0,3,Sun Jul 12 20:45:12 2015 UTC,I did the seven credit exchange also for arbitrary day and my Santa lied and said they sent something and even went so far as to put a fake tracking number. I think it's too late to be rematched though for me.
secretsanta,3d1s9c,okayfineletsdothis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"That's damn harsh. I'm surprised that could happen during a 7 credit exchange.

secretsanta,3d1k5d,dragonsky,7,Sun Jul 12 19:39:06 2015 UTC,I already started buying nail polish supplies for my person. The best thing about that is that if they don't need/want it I can keep it myself. SCOREE
secretsanta,3d1k5d,Easyandfree,6,Sun Jul 12 21:54:15 2015 UTC,I am excited about the hometown exchange! That is going to be a challenge to shop for. The area I live in is so small it's not even a town.
secretsanta,3d1k5d,avidscifireader,3,Sun Jul 12 22:56:11 2015 UTC,I'm the same. I was going to do my town and incorporate the larger town that's like 2 mins away. IDK if you have any larger towns near you or not.

I was not going to since I am going out of town and am moving in a month, but I can't stay away from exchanges!   It is perfect timing as well! Tomorrow, I have to pick up a friend from the airport, so I am definitely going to get my Hometown match a couple of typical touristy things from there, but I am also going to get them some of our local spices, and some unique things from my area! I am also going to get them stuff from my actual hometown where my parents live AND the town I have lived in for the last 4 years! I am excited for this one!  I also signed up for jewelry and nail polish.   Even though I already sent my Arbitrary gift and he loved it, I have been wanting to get him another special something, so hopefully I'll be able to send it out this week!

International shipping can be crazy expensive (This is not an exaggeration!), so please take that into consideration before signing up."
secretsanta,3d27xq,charliehaven,2,Sun Jul 12 22:56:08 2015 UTC,The cheapest international shipping I've found (I live in the US) is $25 and that's only for a small flat rate box.  Doesn't hold much.  I'm not sure about other online retailers.  I have heard horror stories about shipping internationally (upwards of $75-$80).
secretsanta,3d27xq,demonnibri,3,Sun Jul 12 22:59:07 2015 UTC,I buy stuff that is already in their country and have the company ship it to them from there.  It means that I can't wrap it though.  However if you do it through amazon they will normally wrap it for you for a small fee.
secretsanta,3d27xq,OeRnY,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"This,  It makes sense to do it this way if the packing is twice or three times expensive as the gift.  Yet I enjoy getting wrapped gifts or wrapping them myself."

secretsanta,3czmlo,angelxox,26,Sun Jul 12 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"I think the rule of thumb should be that if your art or craft-work is of a skill level appropriate to sell for real profit, then making things is a great choice.   If your skill level is is more that of an enthusiastic, relatively good hobbiest... then include it in addition to a 'main' gift."
secretsanta,3czmlo,LunarBloom,5,Sun Jul 12 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"This is a very good rule of thumb.  And it might be a useful addendum that if you're not 100% sure, maybe post a couple samples online for other people's opinions?  I'd be delighted if someone gave me a professional-looking piece of original art, for example, but if it's too amateur, I'm not sure that I'd have a place for it and I'd feel awful that someone spent time and effort on something that didn't fit with my ""decor""."
secretsanta,3czmlo,GeekSnozzle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. I periodically do a homemade gift in addition to an actual 'store bought'. I'm not fantastic but I'm not terrible :). Sometimes they turn out pretty great.   I also put in my preferences that I enjoy home made gifts and have gotten some truly amazing things from my awesome and talented Santa's. Hand dyed yarn, a gorgeous dog bowl, beautiful magnets, some kick a** book marks, and fantastic pot holders & kitchen towel.   The non-home made gifts have been really great too. I think it's all about the thought you put into the gift."
secretsanta,3czmlo,cuddleswithkoalas,11,Tue Jul 14 23:32:13 2015 UTC,"My exchange experience with home made was terrible. I was really excited for the Harry Potter exchange last year and went a little overboard on some really awesome Etsy items for my giftee. My Santa sent me a message saying my gift might be a little late but they were working really hard on it. When my gift arrived I could immediately hear broken glass when I picked up the box. I opened it to find a wooden box with a glass top (shattered). Inside the box was a Hogwarts acceptance letter that was clearly printed on a home printer and poorly cut out, a ""wand"" that was literally no more than a stick covered in hot glue (for texture?) And painted brown and 3 homemade potions that were just glitter in water in little glass bottles sealed with more hot glue. Furthermore all of the ""potions"" had leaked and I was now covered in glitter and bits of broken glass. I didn't want to make my Santa feel bad so I posted saying that everything arrived broken and damaged and it all ended up in the bin but thank you anyway. While that was true I was also pretty upset that someone with the artistic ability of a 3rd grader had attempted an entirely homemade gift.   As for your situation, why not just send your giftee a message asking if home made is ok? Let them know its a subject you're familiar with and you enjoy creating original art around it."
secretsanta,3czmlo,LealahLove,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:54 2015 UTC,Oh wow. I will be messaging my giffee if they like homemade or not and will prob also get something brought if they do. But I have a degree in Art and Design so hopefully it wont turn out like a 3rd graders HAHA... But I think it's best to ask rather than surprise them :D Thank you for your story I'm sorry it didn't turn out for the best :(
secretsanta,3czmlo,LealahLove,2,Sun Jul 12 22:07:19 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to seeing what you create. You should post pics in this thread when the exchange is done.

secretsanta,3czmlo,phantomliger,10,Mon Jul 13 03:24:08 2015 UTC,It will really depend on your giftee.  Once you are matched you can message them from the redditgifts exchange page and ask if they would be ok with something handmade.

It usually isn't, so I include it as an extra and buy something that will be the main gift.  In my experience this is the perfect system. That said, I love receiving handmade stuff, as it is something special and truly unique. But I understand that there's people that doesn't care much about those things and prefer store-bought gifts. And that's alright too."

secretsanta,3cxdqo,iTiffany,44,Sat Jul 11 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard for everyone to hear, but entering an exchange expecting the money to come after you're signed up is not a good idea.  Sometimes you need to make the wise choice and choose to sit one out, especially if you're not 100% sure you can afford it when the shipping deadline comes.  I know I've had to sit one or two out due to my uncertainty of being able to deliver.   Coming from someone who has been promised weeks after deadline from my Santa, only to have them permanently flake out, it stinks.  The bottom line is that if you can't afford to enter an exchange by the day of matching, maybe it's one you weren't meant to enter."
secretsanta,3cxdqo,cupcakegiraffe,8,Sun Jul 12 00:13:23 2015 UTC,Yup.  I desperately wanted to do this last round of exchanges but I was just laid off and I can't be irresponsible right now.    I also agree with cupcakegiraffe that you should have the money in hand when you sign up for an exchange.  That's what I will do next time.  I was guilty of having to wait (and make my giftee wait) for the next payday before.  It's not fun.  :(
secretsanta,3cxdqo,HarryPotterGeek,-5,Sun Jul 12 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that you need to have the money in hand in order to sign up for an exchange. I live week-to-week on a barely livable amount of money, but I know exactly what I spend and how much I can spare each week, and have never stiffed a giftee or spent less than NZ$60 (excluding zero credit echanges) - and I almost always do international.  Unexpected things can come up regardless of your situation, but if everybody who participated had spare cash set aside before matching day I think it would count out a lot of people right now."
secretsanta,3cxdqo,Tea__Rex,2,Sun Jul 12 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"I could see not having the money in hand before the exchange but have a good idea of your finances at least. /u/Tea_Rex, you seem to have a budget figured out so a bill would never surprise you. Unless it was a hospital or plumbing emergency or something along those lines that are unpredictable then you should always be prepared what your pay should cover so that the ""I had bills"" would not be an excuse to stiff a giftee.   Also it is nice that OP kept in contact with their giftee but I hope the giftee doesn't count on a promise for later and not sign up for a rematch. Seen too many times where the Santa's intentions were good but they never followed through and the giftee waited until it was too late to get anything. Sucks when you do your end and your Santa does not. I hope OP is able to at least send a small gift so she doesn't get banned and then next time plan out her bills better."

secretsanta,3cxdqo,PurpleTulip9,-4,Sun Jul 12 03:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this statement at all.  I could understand if someone entered the exchange with the intention of not properly participating because they don't have the money. We are talking about ""LIFE"" happening which means that something changed from the time one signed up to the point of actually sending a gift.  I would have more of an issue if there were no communication.  Again, that is not the case."
secretsanta,3cxdqo,cupcakegiraffe,6,Sun Jul 12 23:14:34 2015 UTC,"I just had to say something because it was really bothering me that most of the comments seem to say that it's okay, when it isn't. The whole thing allegedly happened because ""bills happened,"" which is not a good excuse. It isn't anything out of the ordinary like an medical need, the AC breaking down, or sudden fracture of a necessary car part.  It was because they assumed they would have the money without making sure that was the case.   I have had a Santa in the past keep in contact with me, promising to deliver by making me a hat, which I was perfectly fine with.  The communication continued until one day, it suddenly stopped. A month later, I ended up asking her to please tell me if I should give up hoping for anything, to which she finally admitted she had no plans to do anything, that life happened.   Good intentions are nice, and everything, but it should not be an excuse for not properly planning for an exchange.  Either you have the money to participate or you don't."
secretsanta,3cxdqo,Zipwang5555,15,Mon Jul 13 00:59:30 2015 UTC,These things can happen. Thanks for messaging your giftee and letting them know!

secretsanta,3cxdqo,Genkaichan,3,Sun Jul 12 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"As a gifter, it's hard to remember that receiving something, however small, is better than receiving nothing but messages.  As a giftee, I can tell you, the coolest gifts I've received were not the most expensive, but the most thoughtful.  Have you considered making something? Or at least sending a handwritten note? Something, anything, that can be opened and that came from a stranger, is the fun part. Not the expense. A letter only costs fifty cents (if you're both in the US), and will bring a world of joy, in and of itself.  So please, I urge you! Don't worry about how your current financial situation has made it so you can't send your giftee anything. Because you can! You just have to send something different.  Please don't think that because you can't send what you wanted to that it's better to send nothing. Send anything!"

Maybe they don't know how awesome those places are and you could introduce them to their new favorite place. Or buy them something from local craftsmen that they may not have heard of. Make them love the awesome city you share EVEN MORE."

But, I'd put money on the fact that he probably hasn't been to some of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood or have an ""I love LAX"" coffee mug (I don't). It could be fun to try to show your gifee new parts of your city."

secretsanta,3cy06l,YouKnow_Pause,3,Mon Jul 13 12:56:58 2015 UTC,Matching is done by country so there is a  small chance that you would be matched with someone in your own city but is does happen.  Now if your country is small then the chances will increase.

secretsanta,3cy06l,something86,2,Sat Jul 11 23:37:51 2015 UTC,"So this question prompted me to go check out the map of participants to see if anyone else from my city is signed up for the hometown exchange and much to my surprise there is another person!  I'm not from a terribly large city, so I wasn't really expecting anyone else, but it appears there is two of us!  The really funny thing though, is it actually shows where I am on the map fairly accurately . . .   Now I'm going to be really amused if the other person in my city ends up being my giftee!  The US is a big place though, the odds are against it.  It would be funny though."
secretsanta,3cxc19,cantrek,3,Sat Jul 11 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Please not mark anything as shipped until you have actually shipped something.

secretsanta,3cxc19,YouKnow_Pause,4,Sat Jul 11 17:16:39 2015 UTC,I think it would be ok if you marked it when you sent the card because they would be receiving something and can wait for that to arrive.

secretsanta,3cut5h,Arlenemusume,3,Fri Jul 10 23:50:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know who my match is yet but I've already got them a nice sack of coal, mined straight from my county! I'm not gonna be a complete Scrooge by sending just coal though, I do plan to get more bits and pieces! It just comes in a nice branded sack (it's palm size, not an actual large sack, imagine the shipping cost!) from an old mine not far from where I live. It's now a museum and you can actually go on a mine tour, guided by former miners. It was brilliant when I went and the money from souvenirs helps keep it open as the tours are all free. Mining was a huge part of the heritage of this area (the north of England) so I thought it was a pretty neat little gift! I thought it was something quite unusual as well do I hope whoever my giftee is likes it too!"
secretsanta,3cut5h,GeekyCreeper,2,Sat Jul 11 13:10:31 2015 UTC,This is so interesting!  I would love to get this if I were your match... it's so creative!

Some notes if you want to impress your friends: it's not chocolate, it's theobromine, which is one of many ingredients in chocolate and the stuff that makes it toxic to dogs.  Theobromine is definitely most common in chocolate and a very active substance in chocolate, but you can also find it in tea, coffee, yerba mate, and guarana!"

secretsanta,3cvgh1,LadyBosie,2,Sat Jul 11 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"I've only been ""agonizing"" to participate at all because of the drama surrounding kickme444. It's really hard not to want to sign up since I love Redditgifts (32 exchanges so far!) That said, I usually only do about two at a time. Last round I did 4 and that really put a strain on me financially because I usually spend between $20-40 per exchange. I see a few that I'd definitely like to do. I might just do 3 (jewelry, nail polish, Nintendo, or hometown) this round, if I do decide to participate."
secretsanta,3cvgh1,Jehnay,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"I'm an active redditor but never been really aware of what was going behind the scenes, or become friendly with any mods or anything so I've read what's been going on but I don't think I truly understand all the nuances.  Those 3 all sound great, I decided to do jewelry but not nail polish- I have so much nail polish I feel like it would be hard not to get me something I already have or really similar unless they got indies which they might not really want to do. My boyfriend is doing the Nintendo exchange, interested to see what he gets!"
secretsanta,3cvgh1,randomthoughts91,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"I am also struggling , I said i will only sign up for one , then now i wanna add jewelery , stickers and ties (well the tie would be for my bf). so i'm not sure ... and im worried i will end up signing up for 4 exchanges , awch , my bank account hurts already"
secretsanta,3cvkwm,YouKnow_Pause,5,Sat Jul 11 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"It's fine. I will sometimes add that I have an Amazon wish list, if it's a difficult exchange. I like it when I get gifts from my wish list, that's why I have one :)"
secretsanta,3cvkwm,Ajs1004,2,Sat Jul 11 03:32:55 2015 UTC,Cool. Cool cool cool.

secretsanta,3cv4wx,Smootsky,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"Did you address the package using the format that your giftee provided in their profile?  Did you ask the USPS if they knew why it was returned to you?  Also, I am showing that your giftee reported No Gift.  If you haven't already, please submit proof that you shipped something at redditgifts.com.  That will cover you on this end.  If your proof is approved, then since you have made a good faith effort to get a gift to your giftee, you will not be required to send it again.  How you would like to handle it at that point would be up to you."
secretsanta,3cv4wx,myuser-name,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:44:29 2015 UTC,I already submitted proof that I shipped it (I even still have the receipt I think) -- I just feel awful that it never got there. I used the address in the exact format my giftee provided.
secretsanta,3ctxds,RollAd20,6,Fri Jul 10 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"The Notes to help your Santa section is usually for general stuff about yourself, put in things you do like and things you do not want.  Like if you are diabetic or have food allergies or other allergies.  This section is usually reserved for general information that will help your Santa to get to know you.    And because there is really no section for more specifics for this exchanges info of likes and dislikes I would say to add things like, do you want food items, souvenir type items, touristy stuff the area is famous for, things like that is what I want to know.  Last year a lot of Hometown exchanges centered around food items from a person's hometown, that is all well and good but I like longer lasting items for memories."

secretsanta,3ctxds,Kigurumix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"I put it anyways. Maybe they want to throw in a shirt? You never know. I've had a few that put their shirt sizes anyways, but necessarily never stated they want a shirt (no shirt size option either). Either way who knows! Maybe they'll get a shirt xD. Even if my match doesn't say their shirt size I'm still going to ask."
secretsanta,3ctxds,Kameiko,3,Sat Jul 11 23:41:02 2015 UTC,"I am extremely excited for this exchange , I entered mainly how much of souvenirs collector i am , and how much i like foreign food . and how i display the souvenirs and what i do with them . but now i think i need to add stuff about my daily life and what i do for a living and my hobbies etc."
secretsanta,3ctxds,randomthoughts91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:43:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest, to me it's about their hometown; so I listed pretty much: ""Send me whatever you want"". This is going to be fun!"

secretsanta,3csfyp,Kameiko,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"This is why I think buying in advance is ok. It's about your hometown, and that's all that matters. Even the surrounding cities it's ok to buy for. I live in Savannah, but I also included stuff from Tybee Island and Fort Pulaski. They're are both in the same county, so it's alright. So what you're doing is awesome!   If you want some more suggestions, do what I did. You live on an island? near the coast? Get shells, the ocean/sea, and sand. Seal it up in a jar or ziploc bag. Make sure to put a label that says ""Don't drink the water!"" haha.  You're welcome!"
secretsanta,3csfyp,Kameiko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:01:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for the tips.

secretsanta,3csfyp,vampedvixen,2,Sat Jul 11 22:15:57 2015 UTC,That sounds like a blast. I may do something similar but make a day trip through some tourist spots
secretsanta,3csfyp,iamusingbaconit,2,Fri Jul 10 19:59:28 2015 UTC,Great! I love how this exchange just makes me want to do all sorts of things. It's much more then just shopping. I am enjoying it at least as much as last year.
secretsanta,3csfyp,iamusingbaconit,2,Fri Jul 10 20:19:45 2015 UTC,You could add in some of your other senses as well. What does your town smell like? Taste like? Feel like?

secretsanta,3cpoop,AssicusCatticus,2,Thu Jul 9 19:51:40 2015 UTC,Your exchange is marked as completed because you have done everything that you need to do to complete an exchange. It does not affect whether or not you will be able to be rematched.
secretsanta,3cpoop,TheOpus,2,Thu Jul 9 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks.  I was just curious.  I mean, if I don't get rematched, well, it happens, right?  I'm in the nail polish exchange, so maybe that one will be awesome.  :)"
secretsanta,3cpoop,dandan97,3,Thu Jul 9 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"Rematching is totally dependent upon the number of awesome people who volunteer to be rematchers.  We almost never have enough rematchers to go around in the regular exchanges (zero-credit exchanges being the exception sometimes).  If someone does not get a gift in an exchange, an effort will be made to match them to a known good gifter in the next exchange that they participate in.  That works really well.  Anyone who does not send a gift is banned from all future exchanges."
secretsanta,3cpoop,TheOpus,2,Thu Jul 9 22:09:07 2015 UTC,Do they get banned using their account or something else? I've always wondered
secretsanta,3cpoop,dandan97,2,Fri Jul 10 03:19:35 2015 UTC,They are banned from participating in redditgifts exchanges. They are not banned from reddit.
secretsanta,3cpoop,TheOpus,3,Fri Jul 10 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"I get that, I'm just curious if their specific account is banned from exchanges or if it goes deeper than that as far as the ban from exchanges  Say they made a new profile?"
secretsanta,3cpoop,dandan97,3,Fri Jul 10 03:53:02 2015 UTC,There are several anti-fraud measures in place to help ensure that people who are banned from exchanges stay out of exchanges.
secretsanta,3cpoop,TheOpus,2,Fri Jul 10 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"Oh. Neat. Thanks for the quick responses. One last thing, if I offer my first born and a box of snacks (costco sized) would I ever be able to help out in a mod kind of way?"
secretsanta,3cpoop,dandan97,3,Fri Jul 10 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Boy or girl first born? Do you come from hearty stock?  =)   Actually, we have a really solid mod team right now, but every now and then they will put the call out in the sub when they ate looking to add someone."

secretsanta,3cpoop,TheOpus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"There isn't enough rematches.... You may not get rematched. you can see how many rematchers are left by clicking on the Statistics. You will see rematchers signed up to the rematch number. But if you don't get a gift thisround, the next round they will do their best to match you with someone who has given in the past. I don't sign up to these to get gifts.. Thats a cool part of it but I really like seeing how my giftee reacts to their gifts. Thats what it's all about. It's really unfair that some people are just in it for the gifts and don't go through with sending a gift to their giftee."

secretsanta,3cnhd7,FirePfenix,29,Thu Jul 9 07:23:48 2015 UTC,This happens occasionally when your original Santa ships late.  Please post both your gifts to the gallery by clicking both thank your Santa and thank your rematch Santa and posting each gift to each Santa.  Often times people who get two gifts choose to be a rematcher to pay it forward.
secretsanta,3cnhd7,Phaeorith,14,Thu Jul 9 07:30:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer. I wasn't sure what to do. I'm fairly certain I had a look of 'oh dang' when it finally registered what had happened.  I am currently signed up as a rematcher for the Arbitrary Day exchange, but I'm still waiting to be matched up for it."
secretsanta,3cnhd7,Kigurumix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:35:14 2015 UTC,I had the same thing happen for the condiments exchange but my regifter hasn't pulled my info yet. Can I unrequest a regift?

I offered to pay for materials and shipping, and will of course mark each present accordingly.  (And will be a rematches in future exchanges)"
secretsanta,3cnhd7,JoyfulStingray,3,Thu Jul 9 13:18:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't get yourself too down about it but I would try to return the favor and be a rematcher if you are able.
secretsanta,3cnhd7,henriettagriff,2,Thu Jul 9 12:39:08 2015 UTC,This happened to me with an exchange.  I was a rematcher with the next exchange that I participated in to make it all even.  :)

secretsanta,3cp06c,po0rdecision,4,Thu Jul 9 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is due to the amount of emails and msgs people receive about not posting their gift yet.

Relax redditgifts, if it comes, it comes. If not, that's cool too."

It didn't work once we got a Nintendo in my house though. (28/F for clarification)"
secretsanta,3cj53v,Churippu,2,Wed Jul 8 20:08:28 2015 UTC,Haha I remember my dentist had a play area and the slides had office carpet on it so instead of worrying about the dentist you would be more concerned about rug burn. And yup I agree all the honeys want to play with my gun xd

My santa reported sent and apparently submitted proof, but nothing has arrived, and my gifter has not contact me yet. So I'm going to give it 10 more days or so, but I reported no gift."

secretsanta,3cjwa7,weffey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:39:45 2015 UTC,Join the club. This was my 3 Ed and probably final exchange as I have gotten nothing from two santas and no admin review for my shipping proof. New exchanges start tomorrow and I still have no credits.
secretsanta,3ck4yn,ProfDrTitsmack,3,Wed Jul 8 15:19:09 2015 UTC,You did what you were supposed to do by marking it Not Received.  Your gifter will not get in trouble as long as they provide proof that they actually shipped something.  Failing to mark No Gift when you get the final reminder can result in your being banned.  This is all explained in this section of the FAQ that is linked on the sidebar.

secretsanta,3ckkow,redbunny415,3,Wed Jul 8 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Salmiakki is salty liqourice candy. It's one of the most beloved candy tastes in Northern Europe and is an acquired taste. Try it, and if you don't like it; mess with your friends. Auran Sinappi (Mustard of Aura river) is a mustard that goes particularly well with sausage. A good combo is for example mashed potatoes and grilled sausages with mustard. Glögg or glögi is a mulled wine traditionally drunk in wintertime, especially near Christmas. Stores and liquorstores in Finland are always stocked with premixed glögi in the winter, but you can easly make it yourself. Take a pot, add 1 bottle of wine, add spices according to the instructions on the back, bring to a simmer, remove from heat and serve hot with bowls of raisins and almonds to spoon in. Google glögi or glögg recipes to find more. Here's some tryhard version."
secretsanta,3ckkow,Biiviz,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Salty liquorice:       Salty liquorice, also known as salmiak or salmiakki, is a variety of liquorice flavoured with ammonium chloride, common in the Nordic and Baltic countries, Netherlands, and Northern Germany.  Ammonium chloride gives salty liquorice an astringent, salty taste  (hence the name), which has been described as ""tongue-numbing""  and ""almost-stinging"".  Salty liquorice is an acquired taste  and people not familiar with ammonium chloride might find the taste physically overwhelming and unlikeable.   Salty liquorice candies are almost always black or very dark brown and can range from very soft to very hard and may be brittle. The other colours used are white and variants of grey. Salty liquorice is also used as a flavouring in other products, such as ice creams and alcoholic beverages.

I think the remaining modes will keep secret Santa running smoothly.   ...stupid question from a exchange newbie, what exactly are the elves and should I buy them?"

If there is an easy way to ship (like books through the book repository) I sign up.  Gift locally? I've long given up on that. There are rarely many if any people who sign up from Israel and my first time ever was local and I got shafted by both my Santa and my rematch.

It's basically US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. I don't speak French, German, Italian or Japanese, so it makes shopping there difficult. Shipping anywhere else costs more than an arm and a leg PLUS I don't get the opportunity to add a proper personalized message.  *If the option is available and relevant."

secretsanta,3ceckr,doucement_doucement,4,Tue Jul 7 17:21:23 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have heard nothing to indicate that redditgifts is being ""steered toward lining investor pockets"".  redditgifts continues to be free to signup and will continue to focus on the joy in giving.  The annual redditgifts For The Teachers exchange will be happening again this year and I hope that people will again sign up and share their generosity by donating supplies to teachers and students in need.  My point is that redditgifts is continuing on like it always has, but I understand if people want to step back for a while."
secretsanta,3ceckr,GeekyCreeper,9,Tue Jul 7 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Like I said, time will tell on the monetisation issue. As things stand now, we're not helping anything by throwing assumptions around. As the reddit admin are not going to share reasons for firing people (and nor should they, that would be grossly unprofessional) and Kickme does not seem to want to/can't share why he was fired, we do not know that for certain. If it turns out to be true, I will be reassessing my views, but for now I'm sticking around.   Also, while there are many reasons for the userbase to be upset with and feel neglected by the admin, redditgifts is not one of them. It is one part of the site that imo functions very well and smoothly, and there is a lot of communication between it's admin and the users. If we cannot support what reddit is doing right, how will they know how to improve in other areas?"
secretsanta,3ceckr,I_Lase_You,2,Tue Jul 7 13:47:38 2015 UTC,Amen to that!
secretsanta,3ceckr,Shadylane85,2,Tue Jul 7 11:07:23 2015 UTC,"So glad you're sticking around lil_poundcake. You're one of the most amazing santas round here, and I should know :)."
secretsanta,3ceckr,OceanSiren,3,Tue Jul 7 10:03:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! You were a lovely giftee. I hope we get matched again someday!
secretsanta,3ceckr,I_Lase_You,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:39:36 2015 UTC,I'll sit this one out and see how things go without /u/kickme444 before I consider doing another exchange.  The Christmas exchange is going to be insane if they are down one person.
secretsanta,3ceckr,randomthoughts91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting this one out too, but for financial reasons. I'm moving internationally this week, and while I'd like to participate, I just don't think I'll have the money or time to meet the deadline."

secretsanta,3cgesy,Marlmos,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"I've had this 3 times, once I marked it as not arrived and then when it did finally arrive (it came from Canada and took around 6-8 weeks I think) I just posted the pics. The other two times thankfully I marked it as not arrived because they never did, once I got a successful rematch and the other nothing but at least it means those two will get banned and not be able to con the exchanges again."

secretsanta,3chejp,AugustBurnsRadish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"You got it back?  I sent a package to Russia, and when I got home and looked at the receipt, it said ""United Arab Emirates"".  I went back to the post office who said ""Well if it said Russia on the package, it will get there"". Six months and dozens of phone calls later... I just have to assume it's gone."
secretsanta,3chejp,dangoodspeed,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it was because I put my address on the back just in case something like that happened. I guess they couldn't be bothered to put it in a bag to be sent to South Africa, and just sent it back to me.  How some people can confuse places is beyond me. Hopefully your package eventually reached its destination."
secretsanta,3chejp,mjun5,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:12:18 2015 UTC,"The USPS seems to do this fairly often. A letter from a friend in the US once got routed to Uganda before finally getting to me in the UK. I have no clue how those two countries were confused, but it at least makes a tad more sense than Kenya and South Africa."
secretsanta,3chejp,dandan97,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:34:59 2015 UTC,"Bold dark ink and press hard on the customs paper which doubles as the address and junk. There are so many layers that it fades fast if you use a normal ball point.   Then get a sharpie and write the address nice and clear on the package where it won't get covered.   Then double check the address with the clerk (I always go inside to send international). No ones perfect at it, even them  Source: postal employee"
secretsanta,3cgufl,Cyclops7747,8,Tue Jul 7 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"Don't sign up for international shipping unless you can truly afford any shipping price that may be thrown at you. Some of those international costs can get outrageous, even for something as simple as a bookmark."
secretsanta,3cgufl,LucidDreamer18,3,Tue Jul 7 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, if you sign up for international matching, check out websites you could use to ship directly to cut down on cost :)"
secretsanta,3cgufl,Tea__Rex,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to your giftees likes and dislikes.  Don't shop before you are matched because you never know what your giftee might or might not like.  It is perfectly fine to communicate with your giftee, you can do it anonymously via the redditgifts exchange page."
secretsanta,3cgufl,Kigurumix,2,Tue Jul 7 21:04:00 2015 UTC,Checkout the FAQ.... Thoroughly.... There are many info you will be asking later in there as well.
secretsanta,3cgufl,iamusingbaconit,2,Tue Jul 7 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"I've read the FAQ, I'm just wondering if there's any extra info I should know BESIDES what's in the FAQ."
secretsanta,3cgufl,iamusingbaconit,3,Tue Jul 7 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"The process and procedure is pretty much covered in there. If to say expectations, just try not to have high expectations on your gifts (sometimes is great, sometimes is not) but most importantly is The Giving part. The last exchange, I was so caught up in browsing and selecting gifts for my giftee that I forgot I'm receiving one too, so when my gift arrived I'm always surprised and happy about it. Being shafted twice is not fun but I'm grateful there're kind people who sign up as rematch Santa."
secretsanta,3cgufl,charliehaven,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:54 2015 UTC,Keep in contact with your match!  I always shoot them a message the day matching happens so the communication line is open.  That way if they want to ask me something they can.
secretsanta,3cgufl,justeeee,3,Tue Jul 7 21:25:07 2015 UTC,But don't be upset if they don't respond!  Some people don't check their RedditGifts account between sign-ups and when they need to get their giftees address for shipping and it doesn't mean they're not interested/hate you.
secretsanta,3cgufl,charliehaven,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:03 2015 UTC,"Yes!  This, too."
secretsanta,3cgufl,beautyoftheday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:12:33 2015 UTC,what do you say in your message?

secretsanta,3cgufl,beautyoftheday,2,Wed Jul 8 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"this will also be my first exchange.  I'm signed up for the hometown exchange.   i agree international shipping is expensive, so i only signed up to be matched to someone local.  But international would be exciting to select because then you may get someone international as your santa and you can get cool things you have never heard of"
secretsanta,3cgufl,randomthoughts91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"i advise you to go international on this one , only this exchange , it will be waaaay cooler"
secretsanta,3cgufl,angelxox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:22:10 2015 UTC,"Being a santa: Make sure you read what your giftee Likes and dislikes. Send them messages and keep them in the loop on whats going on, Let them know once you have sent the gift. Overseas shipping can be expensive so look for places that deliver close to where they live. Don't just get the cheapest or first thing you see. Don't forget you are making their day so get something they will love :D   Being a giftee: The more you write  the better. Make sure you let your santa know what you like and don't like. What you already own or things you may want. Stuff your into right now.. Ramble !! Make sure once you get your gift you post it.  :D I also add places where they can buy things as it's really expensive to ship to NZ."

secretsanta,3cfvp1,Babe-raham-Lincoln,3,Tue Jul 7 16:23:03 2015 UTC,If they don't post within a couple days I always throw a message to the giftee asking if they recieved it. If they say yes I screen shot that and submit as well to seal the deal :)

secretsanta,3cfvp1,day248,2,Wed Jul 8 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"I personally submit shipment proof within the hour I actually ship my gifts. Even though I get a bit ahead of myself as far as shopping goes, covering my bases is my way of securing my future participation.   Good luck though :-)"
secretsanta,3cfvp1,dandan97,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. I always MEAN to do this, but I never remember to do it until I check tracking on something, see it arrived DAYS ago, and note my giftee (even though they've been messaged or what-have-you) hasn't posted it. THEN I bother to post shipping confirmation.   I'm part of the problem."
secretsanta,3cfvp1,dandan97,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"Happens, I believe there was a mod post earlier also stating that they manually go through them and they had a thousand something to do. They'll get there eventually.   I've just read too many bad stories (even though the good heavily out weigh the bad) to not post proof early."
secretsanta,3cg8mz,SkaveRat,3,Tue Jul 7 17:52:59 2015 UTC,If you have been asked to mark if you have or haven't received your gift please do so.  Your Santa will not be punished if they provide proof that they shipped your gift.  Once you gift arrives you will be able to go back to your exchange and thank your Santa by posting to the gallery.
secretsanta,3cg8mz,A_frakkin_Cylon,2,Tue Jul 7 17:55:27 2015 UTC,found the info text on the form page. thanks :D
secretsanta,3cg8mz,A_frakkin_Cylon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:58:19 2015 UTC,Haha I literally just asked this same question but mine is due to international shipping.  If he doesn't have shipment proof what happens? I don't want him to be punished for sending it slow!
secretsanta,3cg8mz,YordlePoro,2,Tue Jul 7 18:38:02 2015 UTC,Your Santa won't be punished once your gift arrives and you post it to the gallery.  If it never shows up then they will have to provide proof or their account will be banned.     This is why we suggest that you keep proof in case your gift gets lost in the mail or your giftee reports no gift.
secretsanta,3cgm8n,ageorge03,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:23 2015 UTC,I don't show that your Disney rematch Santa has marked your gift as shipped so from this you can assume it is from your original Santa since it is marked shipped.

I know at one point a mod gave the number of unmatched folks from that exchange...is that public knowledge you can share?

secretsanta,3cfjt2,YouKnow_Pause,2,Tue Jul 7 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"There are usually not enough rematchers to go around in most exchanges.  The zero credit exchanges are sometimes the exception.

secretsanta,3cfjt2,TheOpus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to know where we are in the rematch pool?

I watched all three seasons in a week, and then I went back to Voyager and whenever Janeway was talking I couldn't get it out of my head that I knew that voice from somewhere. Googled it, freaking Janeway. Blew my freaking mind."
secretsanta,3cbqif,YouKnow_Pause,2,Tue Jul 7 03:33:19 2015 UTC,I'm super obsessed with OITNB! It took me a couple episodes to figure out why Redwas so familiar. Once I did though I became even more crazy about the show. =) I'm going to Vegas next month for a Voyager 20th anniversary convention and hopefully I'll get to meet Kate!

secretsanta,3cbjp2,kjbrasda,3,Mon Jul 6 17:17:04 2015 UTC,Your santa(s) and the redditgift mods are the only ones who will see your name and address.
secretsanta,3cbjp2,kjbrasda,6,Mon Jul 6 17:07:28 2015 UTC,The mods do not have access to anyone's personal information.  Only a small number of reddit employees have access that information.

secretsanta,3cbjp2,RuthMargaretB,2,Mon Jul 6 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"Do people at work not notice/ask?  I work in a really small office and I used our UPS account to mail my gift (it's discounted through work so we're allowed to send personal mail and pay them back) ... was just hoping no one would ask what I was mailing across the country.    But that's mostly because I haven't told them I'm on reddit.  If they knew though, they'd want to know what my gift was when it arrived.  We all pretty much know what mail comes through."
secretsanta,3cbjp2,AbruptlyBlue,2,Mon Jul 6 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"They honestly don't notice! I work in a boarding school, so parcels come through the mail room all the time anyway. My boss knows I'm on Reddit, though - I even did the Pets exchange on behalf of his dogs!"

secretsanta,3c97vi,theLily,3,Mon Jul 6 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"Secret Santa 2014.  This round, my fourth exchange, was the first time I didn't get a gift. It's a little upsetting, but I've signed up for two this time around, and I think it's great."

secretsanta,3c97vi,you-made-a-bear,3,Mon Jul 6 17:47:43 2015 UTC,Postcards 2014.  I am a postcard collector and it seemed like a low risk exchange to start with. I'm now totally hooked.
secretsanta,3c97vi,Mollinator,3,Mon Jul 6 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"I see that the recommended amount to spend is $20/exchange.  Do you buy $20 worth of postcards?  I think postcards awesome, my friend for over 10 years and I send each other postcards for every city we go to.  Long tradition of ours.  What states have you collected so far?"
secretsanta,3c97vi,Jayke1981,2,Mon Jul 6 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"The 0 token exchanges, you don't have to spend the full minimum $20 - that's the only times the rule doesn't apply."
secretsanta,3c97vi,Wanderingsidhe,2,Mon Jul 6 08:24:33 2015 UTC,For 0 credit exchanges - like postcards then there's no recommended spend. Just a postcard but some choose to spend more.
secretsanta,3c97vi,Pinkturtledove,4,Mon Jul 6 09:57:20 2015 UTC,Redditgifts for the Teachers 2014. I loved the idea of helping out local teachers with things like books and crayons. Something so little could make such an impact. After that I was just hooked.
secretsanta,3c97vi,Bloodysun93,4,Mon Jul 6 02:50:52 2015 UTC,I also just signed up for my first secret Santa. I am signed up for the sticker exchange and deciding between the nail polish and Nintendo exchanges.

The little brother of my boyfriend at the time told me I should check out this ""online gift exchange with strangers thing"" and I never looked back. Sometimes I skip batches because of lack of funds or not having enough interest in the exchanges that batch, but I've done quite a few and I have loved every second of it."

secretsanta,3c97vi,Melanie_Raye,3,Mon Jul 6 05:38:10 2015 UTC,Arbitrary Day 2014. I made a uni student's day by sending her a nintendo ds. I had no idea about how secret santa works nor about the type of reaction I would get and her post floored me quite emotionally. It's a great feeling to make other people feel happy and also my family enjoy sharing the experience with what sorts of presents I get and what I send to different places in the world. I am glad this is part of things I enjoy doing :)
secretsanta,3c97vi,koryuuu,3,Mon Jul 6 09:18:23 2015 UTC,My first was Hockey 2014

secretsanta,3c9y20,Drwho4,3,Mon Jul 6 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"I've done both.   I prefer the 3 credit (or any higher tier) because I just generally feel like anyone with 3+ credits to spend has been doing this for at least three exchanges, and at least 2 rounds (since you only get one credit when you start), so they know how to play the game. You can get elf right away, without truly understanding how redditgifts works.  But my SO is the opposite. He thinks that those with elves care more about redditgifts and will do a good job at gifting/filling out their profile.  Give it a try. No point in wasting elf status :)"
secretsanta,3c9y20,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jul 6 15:36:10 2015 UTC,I have had awesome giftees as an Elf. If you have it anyway it's probably worth a try :)
secretsanta,3c9y20,Tea__Rex,2,Mon Jul 6 11:47:08 2015 UTC,"I've found when doing a plus exchange I receive better quality matches. Somebody who messages me, asks questions, or even takes their gift out and gets pictures in cool locations."
secretsanta,3c9y20,AbruptlyBlue,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"I think I only did one non-Elf exchange ever.. but I just love being an Elf.  I don't know if the gifts are better, but I think most Elves are really good with contacting and posting in the gallery. I have been a rematcher too (for non-Elves) who didn't post any pictures (I know it's not a must, but I always like to see them).  Also some of my Santas and giftees have been really awesome.. :)  I would certainly give it a try!"
secretsanta,3c98bm,never_be_boring,12,Mon Jul 6 02:05:33 2015 UTC,This can happen when the original Santa is super late in sending.  You will not be penalized for receiving two gifts.  Please post both gifts in the gallery and all will be good.  What some people in this situation choose to do is to be a rematcher themselves in an exchange as a way of paying it forward.
secretsanta,3c98bm,Jayke1981,6,Mon Jul 6 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"Feel blessed - or pay it forward! Keep hold of the book from rematch and send it in another exchange, but credit both you and your rematch Santa."
secretsanta,3c87ps,NamedForTheLotion,2,Sun Jul 5 20:35:40 2015 UTC,I added a little colour to the home made gift they sent!
secretsanta,3c87ps,americanalyss,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will mind. If they really really didn't want you to add color, they should've laquered them or stained them XD"
secretsanta,3c87ps,Diarygirl,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer:  I am not your Santa.  However, if this is something they handmade, you are probably unintentionally making them feel terrible."
secretsanta,3c87ps,Tammytakeabow,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"Why would it make them feel terrible? Still their work...I just added some colour to display on my shelf with all my other Muppet items! They gave me much enjoyment in adding to it, like I'm sure they did making it! I'd love it if I could get more!!"
secretsanta,3c87ps,Diarygirl,3,Mon Jul 6 00:15:13 2015 UTC,I think it's cute both ways. I can only imagine that your Santa wants you to be happy with your gift!

As much as we love seeing how people enjoy the gifts we sent them sometimes they may not post as quickly as we'd like.  Some only post when they realize they are banned because they forgot.  Don't let a couple bad experiences turn you off secret santa, be happy that you received your gifts and your colors giftee really liked the gift you sent them so try and remember that."
secretsanta,3c6fwd,LucidDreamer18,3,Sun Jul 5 08:11:36 2015 UTC,"My SO had some bad luck with his first couple of exchanges, and then hit the absolute jackpot with his third or fourth.  You're not always going to experience the perfect exchange. That's just how it is. Some people will never post (and will be banned), some people go out of town for a while or are otherwise busy, and will post eventually. Some send iffy gifts, some send you on a cruise. It's just part of the whole deal, like playing the lottery."
secretsanta,3c6fwd,heeeeellooooonurse,3,Sun Jul 5 13:07:35 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling, I spent like $50 on my last exchange and got one sentence that sounded put out and only named 2 of the many items I sent. My other giftees were great and loved their gifts and the time I spent on them. Its hit or miss, but the hits make you feel like a boss."
secretsanta,3c6fwd,ggbmbr,2,Mon Jul 6 01:29:17 2015 UTC,"Don't give up, stuff happens. I love the reddit gift exchange, I've signed up for several. For example, I was matched with someone that was stood up last time, so i got them a custom gift. Turns out it took two months to get to them and Never. Showed. Up. They've been really cool about it, i don't want them to quit!    Another time, my match didn't recognize what I got them so I ordered them my backup and that took forever to ship and came wonky! She was also awesome about it and is exchanging it The key is keeping in touch with your match. I'm sorry you've had bad luck, stay positive though, give plenty of info to your match in your bio :)  Sometimes people don't know what to do so all you can do is participate like you want people to. Others pick up on that. I ask my matches questions so i can really try to pick something personalized :) plus you never know what might be going on, perhaps they're waiting to get paid :)    And yes it's agonizing waiting for them to post it! Message them and ask how they like it!"
secretsanta,3c6fwd,p_i_see_you,2,Mon Jul 6 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I've been doing exchanges for a few years and I love it!!  Whenever my gifts have been late, I've always emailed my giftee and explained and have never had a problem...until this last exchange.  I emailed my giftee throughout the process, but never got any replies, and of course the seller on Etsy that I ordered from was going to take a little longer than I expected, and emailed again but I got reported for not sending a gift, so now I'm banned.  I'm hoping that when my giftee gets it, they'll have the heart to post it because I really enjoy the gift exchanges.  On the bright side (I guess?) my husband is glad that I'm not sending presents to random people..."
secretsanta,3c6fwd,ggbmbr,3,Mon Jul 6 01:51:51 2015 UTC,That's lame - surely you can contact a mod?
secretsanta,3c6fwd,p_i_see_you,2,Mon Jul 6 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"I tried and got the standard answer that if the giftee doesn't post their pics then I am banned but once they post it I guess I'll be allowed to do it again...I'm hoping they will because I really love it, sending gifts especially!!"

secretsanta,3c6fwd,tomdelfino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"And they didn't lift the ban? That's odd. I had a giftee once who never reported getting my gift, but I had a receipt from the post office and posted a photo of it as ""proof of shipping""; I got credit for proof of shipping since the giftee never posted the gift."

I'm so sorry to hear that you're leaving /u/kickme444. I'd imagine this is like giving your baby away. Secret Santa isn't going to be the same without you =[
secretsanta,3bypmf,reerg,15,Fri Jul 3 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"Because they can just get mods who will do the job for free, thus saving them an expensive salary."
secretsanta,3bypmf,bugdog,82,Sat Jul 4 04:00:39 2015 UTC,Guess they wanted someone who could/would commercialize it more?  Thanks for all you've done
secretsanta,3bypmf,joeflux,41,Fri Jul 3 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"That may be what happened with Victoria, too."
secretsanta,3bypmf,spearmintwalrus,25,Fri Jul 3 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Not maybe - that's exactly what Victoria Edit: Quora CEO said.  She said that they asked her to do AMA from companies in order to push a product, but she said that she felt uncomfortable about that.  That's why she was fired.  Edit: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/03/reddit-ama-victoria-taylor-subforums-shut-down-protest-sacking   Marc Bodnick wrote that the dismissal was because “Reddit management was pushing Victoria to do a bunch of highly commercial things around AMAs, but Victoria wasn’t comfortable with those ideas”. He cited video AMAs as one such example, and said that her resistance led to the sacking."

secretsanta,3bypmf,thedragon4453,18,Fri Jul 3 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"Except we tried that, and it didn't work. The marketplace was shut down in February, long before all this."
secretsanta,3bypmf,Damonarc,121,Sat Jul 4 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. I know. Let's fire everyone that the community loves and has helped turn it into what it is.  Godspeed, man. Quite honestly, though it doesn't seem like it now, you might have just been tossed off of a sinking ship right before they went full steam ahead into an iceberg.  reddit's current management really, really doesn't get reddit."
secretsanta,3bypmf,thedragon4453,47,Fri Jul 3 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"Fairly obvious whats happening to Reddit, they hired a CEO to try and spear head a way to monetize a huge user base. They haven't made money since their initial inception, and are trying to capitalize under intense shareholder pressure to produce results, which they need to do before they lose their influx of investor money.  This needs to be done to insure they have longevity and a good foundation businesses need to have reliable income. I just feel that Pao however has none of the background needed or the morals to make the long term calls for the site. The quick money grab strategy may be a precursor to the sites downfall. But it seems no one at head quarters has a better plan, of how to turn these page views into income.  The one thing i fear is that these somewhat minor shuffles that have been happening, are a pre cursor to a sale of either the brand or the whole site. In this scenario it may be the right call, if money is all that is important to the higher ups."
secretsanta,3bypmf,Seriously_nopenope,28,Fri Jul 3 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"Yea, and does no one else find it completely ridiculous that reddit seemingly can't make money, and the first actions seem to be to destroy what attracted the massive user base reddit has?  How does google make money? How does Facebook make money? They scrape your data, and show targeted ads more or less tastefully. Why isn't reddit doing that? You literally sign in and tell reddit exactly what interests you through subreddit choice and up votes. Google and Facebook have to figure out what you like through trickery more or less, on reddit you straight up tell them what you like.   But that's only part, there are lots of ways you could monetize reddit, but that is just the most obvious. Reddit should be extremely attractive to advertisers, but management can't figure it out."
secretsanta,3bypmf,knoxxx_harrington,11,Fri Jul 3 06:54:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, reddit HAS to make money. It can't keep losing money. It is a business and it costs to host this massive site. They basically have 2 options moving forward.            Continue on the path they are on and lose money, eventually shutting down as investors pull out. Monetize the site in some way that will likely piss off redditors and drive everyone away and lead to shutting down reddit.   I understand their need to monetize but based on these moves they have made I think reddit is doomed either way now."
secretsanta,3bypmf,Seriously_nopenope,13,Fri Jul 3 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Where can I find a source on their financial statements?  Seems odd that a company hemorrhaging money would keep existing.    When the bulk of their content comes from its user base,  this claim that they are losing millions annually,  sounds like complete bullshit.     If they are,  why not just toss up some ad banners, instead of doing away with what made them to begin with?   I know it's a business and should make money.   I just find this claim of them losing so much money,  yet somehow existing since 2005, to be complete nonsense.    Where is the proof that reddit has lost money since it started through today?   I hear this claim a lot,  so where is the source?"
secretsanta,3bypmf,Agnostalypse,7,Fri Jul 3 20:04:18 2015 UTC,Well they are privately owned so we won't ever get to see their books.

secretsanta,3bypmf,Agnostalypse,23,Fri Jul 3 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"The fact that we can read your comments now means you're not shadowbanned.

secretsanta,3bz0wk,blueberry1234,9,Fri Jul 3 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Because the reddit admins fired the founders of of redditgifts with no reason or notice, or it seems plan."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,-dudeomfgstfux-,3,Fri Jul 3 18:51:15 2015 UTC,I understood that much though I wondered if by not trusting the process he/she meant something more specific - like there was plans to change the way the exchanges worked etc.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,-dudeomfgstfux-,2,Fri Jul 3 19:27:19 2015 UTC,I felt secure knowing it was being done out of kindness. I'm afraid kindness is leaving this site. Ironic that by creating the unnecessary bullying rule they killed the kindness.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,-dudeomfgstfux-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:41:26 2015 UTC,So did you not trust your last santa?
secretsanta,3bz0wk,lailaimon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:34 2015 UTC,I don't understand your question.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,weffey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:41:06 2015 UTC,I'm afraid kindness is leaving this site.    Did you have a personal experience that made you think this? In your most resent exchange did you not trust your santa?
secretsanta,3bz0wk,lailaimon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"No, no experience with a Santa. Just an initial pause when I signed up and realized that I was giving out my home address and had no idea who would then have it. I thought of horrible possibilities involving murder. But then I thought that the purpose of the exchange was to spread joy and it was run by good people and I trusted that. Now that I'm not as sure of the intent behind it (to sell reddit products maybe?) because they fired one of the people who created it I felt less trusting of the universe to protect me. I know it's magical thinking, but I felt nothing bad would happen because it was run with love. Now that it's run with profit I don't trust that nothing bad will happen."

secretsanta,3bz0wk,Enalon,3,Mon Jul 13 19:40:06 2015 UTC,I would like to know this as well. How will this round of exchanges and those in the future be impacted? Would support be down if there is a problem?
secretsanta,3bz0wk,stitchbomb,10,Fri Jul 3 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"We still have staff working on redditgifts. In fact, before all this started yesterday, we were working on the next set of exchanges."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,stitchbomb,8,Fri Jul 3 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be insensitive to those who have left Reddit, but at the same time I'm happy to hear that there is still a team devoted to the exchanges and Redditgifts. Kudos to you guys, it must be hard with all this going on."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,AbruptlyBlue,18,Fri Jul 3 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I loved doing redditgifts, but I feel the same way you do. Cancelled my participation in the current exchanges and am unsubscribing.   Feeling a bit pissed off that I paid for Elves, honestly."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,AbruptlyBlue,7,Fri Jul 3 09:41:43 2015 UTC,I also just purchased a year on elves and am now wishing I hadn't...
secretsanta,3bz0wk,DrClooney,6,Sat Jul 4 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"This is where I am as well. I just canceled my participation in the upcoming exchanges. Oh well. I wish I could say that at least I knew the cash was going to be well spent, but unfortunately, I can't."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,Todd_the_odd,4,Fri Jul 3 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"ps. We're trying to figure out if elves can be transferred here. Not getting my hopes up, but I'd rather someone else who would actually use it get my leftover months."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,LAUAR,3,Fri Jul 3 19:58:40 2015 UTC,Why would the process have magically changed to stop people from taking part?

secretsanta,3bz0wk,Cieco1,2,Sat Jul 4 18:41:35 2015 UTC,The first time I did it I was a bit apprehensive about giving my home address out but I trusted that the idea was born of kindness and trust and caring people. I'm not sure the process will continue in that vein.

secretsanta,3bz0wk,mister_leroy,11,Fri Jul 3 13:45:19 2015 UTC,The creator of this subreddit left this subreddit after being fired from reddit.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,landsharkxx,5,Fri Jul 3 14:10:21 2015 UTC,So why does this effect the gift exchanges/redditgifts?
secretsanta,3bz0wk,long_wang_big_balls,19,Fri Jul 3 14:13:02 2015 UTC,Redditgifts was created by /u/kickme444. Reddit acquired redditgifts in 2011 and the some of the mods here work for reddit directly. The admins/higher ups of reddit are letting go of valuable employees/mods of popular subs with little to no reason. /r/outoftheloop has some good coverage on the entire drama fest.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,Kameiko,9,Fri Jul 3 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"Little to no reason that we're being made aware of.  When's the last time one of your friends started a new job and their old employer posted on their Facebook, corporate website, or LinkedIn:   ""We fired ____ because we really just felt like shitting on someone today"" ""We fired ____ because they're a terrible employee who failed at everything we asked them to do""?   People are running in circles screaming ""FUCK THE REDDIT CORPORATE SHITHEADS"" for the wrong reasons.  Stop pretending like people losing their jobs is any of your business; until we know why they lost their job and if the reason they lost them was unjustified, THEN we can pick up the pitchforks again.  Until then?  There are plenty of actual problems that deserve your attention on Reddit.  Go rally around those and stop pretending like we have any right to know why /u/kickme444 is no longer around."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,savannahslipper,0,Sat Jul 4 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"It just seems suspicious that they're firing people who were in early on, which implies devotion to the initial spirit of community and to the site, and also who were pretty key in growing the site to its gargantuan size it is today. AMAs and redditgifts are two of the most positive and public-facing assets the site has, and the founder/facilitators have been let go. You're right, it's possible there was a valid reason for it, but I'd be surprised if the main reason wasn't unwillingness to compromise integrity for profits."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,blueberry1234,4,Sun Jul 5 05:22:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't directly, but RedditGifts is owned by Reddit, and some people are leaving Reddit as a whole as a protest."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,happytrails1,4,Fri Jul 3 14:44:58 2015 UTC,"In part perhaps, but I think generally people consider reddit to no longer stand for what it once did, so fuck it - BURN IT TO THE GROUND or smth."

secretsanta,3bz0wk,lookn_glas_shrd,3,Fri Jul 3 17:07:03 2015 UTC,So...should we not participate in the new exchanges?  That makes me sad.  This whole thing makes me sad.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,thechilipepper0,2,Fri Jul 3 13:57:31 2015 UTC,Me too - I have only recently discovered redditgifts and thought it was an amazing idea. It's quite dismaying that they'd get rid of the pioneer of this!
secretsanta,3bz0wk,Not_A_Greenhouse,3,Fri Jul 3 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm considering stopping my participation because after putting a lot of effort in my gifts and being a rematcher a few times, I've had only two gifts that didn't disappoint me. I'm over the ""thought that counts"" when it's been nothing but lackluster effort by Quite a few participants. It's not fair and while you can't control others circumstances, you can guard yourself from disappointment."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,chicagoliz,3,Fri Jul 3 20:38:30 2015 UTC,At least you received something. I've been screwed by both my SS and rematches for the past three gift exchanges.

secretsanta,3bz0wk,thechilipepper0,0,Fri Jul 3 11:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'm somewhat of a reddit novice, and I pretty much have only done a few exchanges.  What I gather is that people in the know are upset with the process of matching -- that is, I suppose people who are known good givers are not randomly matched, but instead get matched with favored staff or users?  I'm trying to understand what ""trust the process"" really means.  Any enlightenment is welcomed."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,SpikeKintarin,3,Fri Jul 3 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"people who are known good givers are not randomly matched, but instead get matched with favored staff or users?   This isn't true in the sense that you're thinking of. In my experience, Secret Santa has always been run extremely well, with the exception of the sudden and unexpected removal of the Redditgifts Marketplace. The issue here is that Redditgifts isn't just a community run project. It's owned and mainly operated by the corporate owners of  Reddit. After all that has come to light over the past couple months, many no longer trust the Reddit staff to keep Redditgifts functioning as it should.   Personally, I wouldn't worry about the safety or quality of the exchanges at the moment, but this could change in the near future, depending on the direction Redditgifts is taken in."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,lookn_glas_shrd,4,Fri Jul 3 14:54:31 2015 UTC,The most recent unhappiness is related to the founder of secretsanta (and separately potentially the other admin related to IAmA) being fired somewhat unexpectedly and leaving. There's some concern that reddit-the-company doesn't really consider reddit-the-community as a part of decision making.
secretsanta,3bz0wk,MsSunshine87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:36:37 2015 UTC,What I have been told is if you do not. Receive a gift from previous exchange that they will make sure to match those people with people known as good gifters
secretsanta,3bz0wk,dresdenreader,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I had the same thoughts after the FPH debacle.

secretsanta,3bz0wk,WLGT,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:47:28 2015 UTC,"/r/fatpeoplehate was briefly banned because it was mean-spirited, but most importantly, encouraging brigading of other subreddits and I imagine external sites.   Other subreddits have extremely unsavory or mean-spirited mantras, but were not banned. This led many to wonder what was going on with the seemingly random censorship, but the other subs weren't brigading outside the subreddit.  In any case, the admin should have given them warning or strikes or whatever instead of dropping the ban hammer down so suddenly. Instead, we had their standard MO of zero communication. That's the underlying issue at stake in all this unease: nonexistent lines of communication. Well that and the questionable routes the admin are taking this site, what with firing of beloved and important commnity-facing staff."
secretsanta,3bz0wk,melodieux_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"This is truly heartbreaking.    I've loved doing these exchanges over the past few years, and even did them when I was nearly broke and could barely pay the bills.  It was a joy to send gifts to those in need or to brighten someone's day.    And now that I've recently been promoted at work, I was planning on doing a TON more, but with everything that's going on...  I just don't want to now.  Doesn't feel like it would be the same, and it won't."
secretsanta,3c1xy1,harleyquinnette,4,Sat Jul 4 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think this one exchange where it more about what represents gifter than the other way around. There preference will be secondary, I came into this thinking it would be cool to see my Santa thinks represents there hometown or state not any specific thing in mind I might like.  And already think what I am going to put in my box sail boat of course since that is my towns icon obviously something to do with lakes fishing and fairs just got figure out perfect gifts"
secretsanta,3c1xy1,shar12mae,3,Sat Jul 4 04:08:58 2015 UTC,Totally!!  I actually picked up a few things already. If they don't match my match I will just keep them.

It's going to take some thinking and I definitely want to know my giftee's interests first. Should I focus on food? Landmarks? Scenery? History? Local businesses? All of the above?   I don't want to bore them. It's almost a guarantee they haven't been here yet!

My plan is to put a bunch of pictures on a flash drive and send that, along with some other stuff.  I have a mug from a semi-local natural attraction already picked up.  If my person likes coffee, I want to get them something from a locally based coffee chain.  If they don't like coffee, then something else from there lol  I have a lot of ideas.  Too many :p"

Still need to buy stuff from Downtown Savannah and fort Pulaski towards Tybee. Whoever gets me is in for a big treat.  I think I might have to cancel anime and manga, because I'm putting way too much money into this haha.  I just hope my giftee doesn't list anything specific, because then that would be bad; but it's your hometown! They should still like whatecer you get them.  To top it all off I've already taken 96 photos of Tybee. I did the light house tour and there were so many cool things in the cottages.  I think I might have a problem."

secretsanta,3c2v8p,shar12mae,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for getting back so quick! Some follow-up questions, if you don't mind:  Will I be able to know if I'm rematched? Or will I just wait for a gift that might never come?  My Santa apparently marked the gift as shipped, but I see no proof. Am I supposed to be able to see the proof, in the case they provided it? (I have no idea if they did).  Just so you know, I sent my match a kickass (if I say so myself) gift that he loved and posted in the gallery, along with providing shipment proof screenshots of the package status in-transit and electronic proof of arrival.  I know giving is better than receiving, and I want to think the best of my Santa, but there's no way for me to 'trust but verify', so to speak."

Two years later, reddit acquired it, and hired kickme444 and 5days. I was the first hire in 2012 after the acquisition, despite being a moderator here for over a year or more before (I can't remember when I became a moderator here).  I continue to be employed by reddit, as is 5days, although gifts does not have 100% of our focus anymore.  Nothing really has changed. The reality is, and I don't want to seem as though I'm undercutting what kickme444 did, but it's been almost a year since kickme444 was 100% on gifts himself.

And no response when I tried to ask before clicking did not receive. But after I clicked no longer saw either match this being second kind of disappointing

Putting on my organizer hat for a moment:    We purposefully have not ever wanted to do a ""send reddit swag"" exchange.

secretsanta,3bu9wj,MSWschnoodle,5,Thu Jul 2 05:10:31 2015 UTC,The $20 recommendation does not really apply to the zero-credit exchanges.
secretsanta,3bu9wj,reddittailedhawk,7,Thu Jul 2 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, spend within your means, but don't just get one measly $2 sticker. Yes, this is a zero-credit exchange, but that doesn't mean you should put zero effort into it. I spent a good chunk of money on my sticker match last year, and ended up getting a bunch of stuff for myself as well since Red Bubble has a good deal on stickers when you buy a bunch. Good thing I did too, because my Santa sent me literally a single sticker, and I know they spent less than $5 so it was a little disappointing."
secretsanta,3bu9wj,reddittailedhawk,3,Thu Jul 2 11:49:35 2015 UTC,This. Right here. This is why I ask. I would hate to be the crappy santa that sends one sticker because they think that's all they're supposed to send.  Thanks everyone! :-)

secretsanta,3bu1yf,Hashtaglibertarian,6,Thu Jul 2 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on the weight and the country, shipping  can sometimes go as high as $100 or more.    This is why we caution people to consider all the possible issues with international shipping before committing to an international exchange.  I can't count the number of posts where people freak out and can't afford international shipping because they didn't even think about the increased costs."
secretsanta,3bu1yf,knoekie,3,Thu Jul 2 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"I always chose international because the Netherlands is really small and doesn't have a lot of participants..  Usually I just buy something small that fits in an envelop and buy a card to make it personal and sent this (this is depending on the weight 3-5$). I have given a bookmarker, spice-mix, a facial mask, stroopwafels and some other small stuff like this.  The main gift is something I buy online and ship directly to my giftee. That way there will be no (high) shipping costs.  I also participated in the snack exchange and this is an exchange where you kinda have to sent something that you can't buy online. I looked at the post-options and decided to stick to a lower weight to not spent to much (but still around 20-30$)..   I always think about the exchanges and if it's doable to buy something online. Right now I want to do nailpolish (where I can buy online, but also sent maybe 1-2 smaller ones in an envelop, or maybe some nailfile) and Life's a Beach (I live close to the beach and have some fun ideas for smaller gifts, depending on my giftee).. I also looked into the hometown exchange, but this would make shipping more expensive (and since I'm already wanting to do the other 2 exchanges I might skip this one)."
secretsanta,3bu1yf,ProfDrTitsmack,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah the lowest price option with PostNL is 18 something Euros without tracking (sending outside Europe though, within the EU it can be quite cheap especially using Kiala). On the plus side delivery can be quite fast. The parcel I sent out for AD2015 arrived in the states within 8 days."
secretsanta,3bu1yf,Hcorona,3,Thu Jul 2 10:01:16 2015 UTC,Boxes are going to be way more expensive. For my Disney exchange they were charging me 70 dollars to ship to the UK. I then packaged it in a smaller envelope  and they charged 27. It's crazy how just they charge. So don't use boxes but envelopes instead.
secretsanta,3bu1yf,OceanSiren,2,Thu Jul 2 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"I would recommend using First Class International Mail. It goes up to 4 pounds before they switch you over to priority. From there, I would compare the price on the USPS site to make sure prioirty is still cheaper than using flat rate boxes before shipping."
secretsanta,3bu1yf,Tea__Rex,2,Thu Jul 2 04:53:19 2015 UTC,For some exchanges I find it cheaper/easier/much better in terms of items available to order online and ship directly to my giftees (There are not a lot of options in my country and things tend to be extortionate in price because only a select few stores for some things exist). So maybe this is an option you can consider too?
secretsanta,3bu1yf,iamusingbaconit,2,Thu Jul 2 05:28:27 2015 UTC,I always appreciate my Santas who are willing to spent that much just to sent those gifts to me.    My way of doing it is choosing the gift with least amount of money but high thought value and spend most of the budget on shipping. I would like to ship somewhere closer sometimes but I always got matched to land far far away...
secretsanta,3bu1yf,CA719,2,Thu Jul 2 08:48:49 2015 UTC,I paid $75 to ship a 5 pound box of candies and snacks from the US to Sweden a couple years ago.   and then they never posted it  http://i.imgur.com/yeAnp0t.jpg
secretsanta,3bu1yf,charliehaven,2,Fri Jul 3 01:20:49 2015 UTC,"I would cry.. pretty much for a week straight.   I'm so sorry this happened to you - I'm surprised you even continued to do it. I mean my Santa fell through for my first round doing this. It was pretty disappointing for a first exchange, I mean I know things come up and you can't do it, I get it. But the person I was a Santa for actually came through and posted her gifts really quickly and she actually liked what she got. That totally made it worth it and now I'm signed up for my second exchange. Even if I don't get anything again I'll be okay as long as my person posts it. That satisfaction is just so fulfilling! The fact that you got burned like that is just really really sad."

Sometimes on Etsy you can find good shipping deals, and you might find a shop that is in your giftee's country which would cut costs."

secretsanta,3bqvf8,oodni,8,Wed Jul 1 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"The only difference between the plus option and a regular option is that you will be matched with someone else who has also spent the same number of credits. It is not a guarantee of a ""better"" gift or a guarantee you will get a gift. The recommended amount to spend is still $20 and the goal is always to send a thoughtful gift. The theory behind it is that someone who has successfully completed multiple exchanges previously will continue to do so."
secretsanta,3bqvf8,salydra,6,Wed Jul 1 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"It just matches you with other people who choose to use 3 credits.

secretsanta,3bqvf8,Bekabam,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"If you look at the credit history, and it says +1, and not -2, then you got your 3 back. You should have +1 for every completed exchange. How many exchanges have you done, and how many credits do you have?"
secretsanta,3bqvf8,salydra,0,Thu Jul 2 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, went to that page, none of my past exchanged say ""PLUS"" so looks like I never did a Plus exchange. Really thought I had.  Thanks for the help"
secretsanta,3bqvf8,Bekabam,2,Thu Jul 2 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"They aren't supposed to say ""PLUS"" on that page, it makes no difference once it's completed."
secretsanta,3bqvf8,salydra,0,Thu Jul 2 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry to keep dragging this on, but if they don't say PLUS then how can I know which I signed up for with 3 credits vs. 1?  I have 6 total credits, have done 5 exchanges. You get the freebie for signing up, so I'm even."
secretsanta,3bqvf8,atouchofyou,2,Thu Jul 2 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"You can check you exchange preferences in the individual exchanges, but it's not a thing that actually matters at all."
secretsanta,3bqvf8,chicagoliz,5,Thu Jul 2 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"My plus santas also have tended to put forth more effort in my gift, like clearly taking a lot of time to pick a thoughtful gift, wrapping it nicely, communicating with me, etc. Of course, non-plus santas can do all this, too! And sometimes plus santas just grab the first thing off an Amazon wishlist and have it shipped. Not that there's anything wrong with that, (shipping twice is a bitch), but I've found that the experience of secret santa is of higher quality in general with plus santas."
secretsanta,3bqvf8,hallbal96,7,Wed Jul 1 13:12:11 2015 UTC,That would be good. I understand not everyone has money. But I have always spent upwards of $50 on my gifts and have always received gifts that don't appear to be worth much (I get thats not why we do it). I am still yet to receive my last gift and would just be nice to have a a great one come back to me. I love buying presents so I guess I'll always do it anyway ☺

(Hometown and the Jewelry exchange) I was going to do the Graphic novels but feel a bit cheeky asking for certain ones, as I really want to get into the Deadpool and Loki ones. We were stuck with the Minecraft as my twins are both into this, but I don't feel right putting them both down for this exchange.

secretsanta,3bo1xu,Allieasha,14,Tue Jun 30 22:20:56 2015 UTC,For the colors exchange somebody had Coral Red as their favorite color and I suggested a jewelry piece with actual coral in it. Vegans didn't like that. Nope. Vegans didn't like that one at all.
secretsanta,3bo1xu,EmberHands,3,Wed Jul 1 03:37:01 2015 UTC,I had no idea coral isn't vegan...what is it then?
secretsanta,3bo1xu,evilbunnyofdeath,8,Wed Jul 1 03:56:48 2015 UTC,"Coral reefs are actually made up of tiny organisms. Coral isn't a stone, it's the tiny skeletons of those organisms. Hence the reason vegans don't use or wear it."

secretsanta,3bo1xu,soundkoala,4,Wed Jul 1 06:58:09 2015 UTC,They are like sea sponges - technically once alive like an animal as opposed to alive like a plant.
secretsanta,3bo1xu,txteva,5,Wed Jul 1 09:40:44 2015 UTC,"My brother got some coral earings for my mom when he went to Australia, and if the coral is red, that means they cut it off while it was still alive. So yea... not so vegan friendly."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,ours_de_sucre,2,Wed Jul 1 14:24:44 2015 UTC,Thank you for explaining!
secretsanta,3bo1xu,evilbunnyofdeath,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"That is not necessarily true though. It could have been cut live but is more likely to have been collected already dead and then dyed, like 90% of coral sold in tourist shops. A lot of living coral is very lightly hued and not at all brightly colored. While there is some that is colored, many places have outlawed cutting live coral. It's much easier and cheaper for the sellers to have it collected dead and then color it than to pay someone more to cut it live and then worry about getting busted for selling it."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,mommy2libras,7,Wed Jul 1 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"This is the exact reason I decided not to participate in the jewelry exchange, I wouldn't want to make my Santa have to figure out something that I could actually wear.   I also wouldn't want to end up with someone who says I can only wear gold or platinum.  Too much risk for a $20 exchange."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,Kigurumix,4,Wed Jul 1 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"I think in that instance you could probably report it to the mods OR ask your giftee if there's another alternative.   I have metal sensitivity (although sterling silver and most nickel-free jewelry is okay) and I was feeling sort of guilty about signing up and then I remembered -- jewelry making falls under jewelry. And I think that would be a fun thing to get a kit to start to do. Or, I crochet...and people make necklaces and bracelets with certain yarns so it would be cool to get a book of patterns or something.  I'm sure you could also buy them a cute ring holder or jewelry box too!"
secretsanta,3bo1xu,PeachBelle524,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Also if you're like me, certain things are easier to wear than others. I'm nickel sensitive but bracelets or rings are less prone to causing me a rash then earrings or a necklace."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,fatpinkchicken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:33:52 2015 UTC,Yes! Same with me! Unfortunately my ring size is a 4 and my wrist size is super tiny as well so it's kind of pointless to try to find me jewelry on my hands.
secretsanta,3bo1xu,PeachBelle524,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:55:27 2015 UTC,Maybe look into children's sized jewellery?
secretsanta,3bo1xu,fatpinkchicken,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:59:58 2015 UTC,"Fabric, shell or leather jewellery could be an option too?"
secretsanta,3bo1xu,txteva,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:04:02 2015 UTC,"I make jewelry out of shells and beads. It's fun and I love being able to use up the thousands of shells I feel necessary to pick up on the beach. I don't think I've ever once gone to the beach and not brought something home. I'm like a child- I pick up rocks too. I have no idea what my problem is, lol."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,mommy2libras,13,Wed Jul 1 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"If you're completely lost about what to get, and just want to be as safe as possible, here are some good rules-of-thumb.  Generally, most people with metal sensitivities can wear the following metals:   Gold and Gold-Filled (not gold-plated... see note below) Sterling Silver (not silver-plated... see note below) Niobium Titanium (this is so inert, it's often used in medical implants)   Some people with metal sensitivities can wear:   Surgical Steel Other stuff that specifies that it is ""nickel-free""   (There are relatively rare metal-sensitive people who can only wear very high-karat gold, but I hope those people realize that they're not going to have a lot of luck with a $20 suggested-value exchange.)  Note about gold-filled vs. gold-plated:  Gold-plated metal has a teeny-tiny bit of gold electroplated onto the outside edge of a primarily base-metal core. Gold plating is prone to flaking off (especially on things like earrings, which is particularly bad because ears tend to be especially sensitive). People with metal sensitivities generally can't wear gold-plated stuff, even if they're able to wear gold jewelry.  Gold-filled metal has a very thick outer layer of gold bonded to a base metal core (thick enough that gold-filled components are often even more expensive than sterling silver components). That outer layer doesn't flake off and won't leave the base metal core exposed and in contact with sensitive skin. Properly cared for, gold-filled jewelry can last a lifetime and never bother the person wearing it.  And /u/OceanSiren makes a good point: the same goes for silver-plated stuff, and do not be fooled by products marketed as sterling silver-plated. There is no such thing. ""Sterling"" silver-plated metal is just plain-old silver-plated metal.  If your giftee specifies that they can wear gold-filled jewelry, please make sure you're not accidentally getting them gold-plated jewelry. They're not the same! (Same for sterling silver vs. silver-plated)."
secretsanta,3bo1xu,LunarBloom,7,Tue Jun 30 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"I am not signing up for this exchange, but I am allergic to everything in the whole world. I can wear exactly three metals (that I am aware of) : sterling sliver, platinum, and titanium. People so often believe there is no nickel in gold, but there is no karat used for jewelry that I can wear without having a reaction. And yes, surgical steel is totally out for me. I have to wear gloves when I use my (Global) kitchen knives, because I will have a reaction from touching them. Even doorknobs, if my hands are even slightly damp, will cause me to break out in hives. I am glad to see people are aware of metal-alleriges, and making others aware as well!"
secretsanta,3bo1xu,BrunoStAujus,5,Tue Jun 30 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I really don't mean this the way it sounds, but holy crap it sucks to be you.   I can't imagine how hard life is with that kind of metal sensitivity. How bad are the hives? Do they go away quickly or does it take you down for the rest of the day if you're not careful?"
secretsanta,3bo1xu,LunarBloom,6,Wed Jul 1 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's fine! My allergies are part of a larger condition; I've not had the amount or degree of reactions I do now my entire life. It truly does suck, quite a lot.   So the issue is that I am quite literally constantly exposed to allergens. There is no way to avoid them unless I live in a 'clean room', which I do have to do on occasion. The more one is exposed to any allergen, the more strongly they react to all allergens.   The hives can last for months sometimes. I walk around looking like a leper if I try on clothing in a store after someone who was wearing perfume for instance, I'll be covered in red welts for weeks and weeks.   I've had an unexplained contact-rash on my legs for about two years. It's considerably better than it was a year ago, but it's still there. Thankfully, not readily noticeable to the general public, but it itches and burns and is a constant unceasing irritation at the edge of my consciousness.   Metals are annoying to deal with, for sure... but the things that impact my day to day life the most significantly are airborne allergen. Perfumes, lotions, smoke, pollen, dust, dander, etc... it's everywhere. There is no way to avoid it while still living a relatively normal life.   I've also been unable to eat a meal I have not prepared myself in many years.    All of that said! You get used to 'it', whatever it may be. Humans are adaptable.

secretsanta,3bo1xu,LunarBloom,5,Wed Jul 1 03:16:52 2015 UTC,"Allergy shots are desensitization therapy, and cannot be used when anaphylaxis is present (generally speaking). It's too dangerous. My allergist is three states away, at a world renowned research facility. He's the best in his particular field of research. The one time I asked about shots, he laughed at me (teasingly). :)"
secretsanta,3bo1xu,kaliena,3,Wed Jul 1 03:26:27 2015 UTC,Damn.  I'm gonna sit over here and be more happy about my simple dust mite allergy and nasal reconstruction surgery and medications and allergy shots...

It's a relatively new thing, so you still won't see it much commercially, but if you buy on Etsy, you'll see quite a bit of it floating around. Silver-filled is the same thing as gold-filled, but with silver. It might also be an option for metal-sensitive people, but I didn't list it because it's so new that I don't have a good feel for what the general consensus has been among metal-sensitives."

Men can wear jewelry just fine, and while they might not care for bracelets, earrings, or necklaces, we do have a few additional options that their matches might not consider: Lapel pins, cufflinks, tie tacks, watches, and the like.

secretsanta,3bsiyv,weffey,3,Wed Jul 1 20:11:33 2015 UTC,you could always just regift or sell any jewelry that you receive? Like maybe ask a parent or friend what kind of jewelry they like and then tailor your preferences towards them

secretsanta,3bmybh,chicagoliz,4,Tue Jun 30 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"I just shipped out my gift to my rematch cookbook giftee yesterday.  He seems like he's been a really awesome Santa for all his giftees, and his profile made it easy to think of lots of things that would be good for him.  It seems like a real shame for him to have been shafted.  I'll never understand why people sign up and then don't follow through. I get that it's an expense, but if that happens, there are ways to send meaningful things for less than $20.  If an unexpected event between sign-up and matching means that even $15 or so would be an insurmountable burden, then you shouldn't sign up in the first place."
secretsanta,3bmybh,chicagoliz,3,Tue Jun 30 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you don't HAVE to spend a ton of money on these things to make someone really happy! I have made a friend through Reddit, who I have actually met in person, and we do private exchanges every so often - and the best one we have done yet was where each of us had to buy five things that cost a pound or less each. If you're not ashamed to be seen in a pound shop, you can pick up some really neat stuff..."
secretsanta,3bmybh,heyPerseus,2,Tue Jun 30 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yes -- that's why I don't understand the lack of follow-through.  You have to take an affirmative step to sign up.  You get an email indicating you signed up.  It's not like you sign up by accident or against your will.  If you don't have time, or don't want to do it, or don't want to spend any money, then don't sign up."

secretsanta,3bmybh,Elmer701,5,Tue Jun 30 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, that means that you have done all you need to do for the exchange, so at this point you just wait to see if you'll be rematched.  (Mods, correct me if I'm wrong, lol)"
secretsanta,3bmybh,cleoola,3,Tue Jun 30 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"Mine did that too, i think it just crosses it off because they consider it to be completed now"

secretsanta,3bmybh,Elmer701,4,Tue Jun 30 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"You get rematched once you report no gift received and select to be rematched. My santa checked my info June 2nd then disappeared completely. If you haven't received anything yet then you can report no gift.

secretsanta,3bmybh,Bonspiel13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"The ""report no gift"" option isn't even permitted? Like it doesn't let me click on it?

The first wave for those who's Santa never pulled their info than for those that the Santa pulled the info but then never received anything and so forth. Is it just too soon for the button to light up?"

secretsanta,3bo8hn,Greely,4,Tue Jun 30 20:19:37 2015 UTC,I'd wait to see if they in fact do get a gift from their original Santa since there is no mandatory ship date for rematchers.  If they do recieve a gift from their original Santa then contact support@redditgifts.com and let them know so they can give you a new rematch and if they don't then you can send them their rematch gift.
secretsanta,3bp6g0,Tea__Rex,4,Wed Jul 1 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"If you are currently being asked to report whether or not you received a gift, please go ahead and mark No Gift at this time.  Your gifter will not get in trouble as long as they provide proof that they shipped something.  And if your gift shows up, just post it in the gallery and all will be good!  Failure to mark No Gift can result in you getting banned.    https://redditgifts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201367385-My-Santa-said-the-gift-will-be-late-Should-I-wait-to-report-no-gift-"

secretsanta,3bp6g0,Sweetsmyle,2,Wed Jul 1 02:45:16 2015 UTC,I would only do that if you know you've been rematched and your rematch Santa has not shipped yet. If you haven't been rematched just posting in the gallery should remove you from the list to be rematched.
secretsanta,3bp6g0,Genkaichan,3,Wed Jul 1 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"This happened to me a few exchanges back. My SS said they could send me something but it would be late. I felt bad about putting ""no gift"" too but in the end, I got rematched and I had no hard feelings toward my original santa (whether they really tried or not, rl happens). I'd say report no gift, rather than waiting for something that may not come."
secretsanta,3bp6g0,AbruptlyBlue,3,Wed Jul 1 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"Simple, mark it as a no gift. If you happen to end up getting two gifts consider signing up as a rematcher in the future."
secretsanta,3bp6g0,Sweetsmyle,2,Wed Jul 1 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"Report no gift. If you receive a gift from your original Santa before your rematch ships something you can then tell them to instead contact support@redditgifts.com but make sure you wait until you actually know for sure you are getting something. My snacks Santa also said they were going to ship late but ended up never shipping anything but luckily I did mark no gift and was able to be rematched. Also, there is a handy FAQ about this very situation so just follow that and you will be fine."

secretsanta,3bpujk,weffey,2,Wed Jul 1 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"Is there no purchaser information at all? If you have a name, you can give me initials and I can let you know who I think it's from.  If not, here's some extra info:   Your Disney Santa's tracking info started with ""LK911"" and came from Australia. Your reddit turns 10 Santa's tracking strated with ""GM545"" and came from Florida, USA. Your Arbitrary Day Santa did not provide tracking, but there appears to be two packages marked shipped, and they are from Canada, but that doesn't mean the gifts are coming from there."

That's what I did for a gift that was never marked received, but the person sent me a message saying they got it.   Also, you never know..they might eventually mark it as received. I just had someone make a gallery post for an exchange that was 5 months ago. Ironically they stated the gift ""took longer than expected to arrive""...which is true, but it was late because my Mom died and I told them that was the reason it would ship a bit late. It's just funny their post mentioned the lateness when they took 5 months to mark it as received."

secretsanta,3bmv90,GENTOOO,2,Tue Jun 30 19:21:09 2015 UTC,Looks like the legality had been addressed in other comments.   My go to for shipping liquids and such is to wrap each item thoroughly in plastic wrap and tape. Then I roll that up in bubble wrap. Then I place it all in a ziploc with some paper towels around it just in case there is a bit of leaking. Then I make extra sure that these items are in the center of the box and there is no wiggle whatsoever. So far I have had great success with this.

secretsanta,3bljvv,I8ABunny,3,Tue Jun 30 11:53:15 2015 UTC,You could find some online shipping calculators for various shipping companies in your area and play around with it a little bit to get an idea of how much it might cost to send something very far away. It can get crazy expensive.
secretsanta,3bljvv,Arlenemusume,2,Tue Jun 30 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"ask in your post office for the charges, here in chile we have a type of package who is cheap, the only ""but"" is you only can send 1 kg in the package. maybe is something like that in your country. and please, PLEASE ask to your giftee for customs in their country, because every one has ther own politics, here for example, all the package under 30 dollars are tax free"
secretsanta,3bljvv,inthetealeaves,2,Tue Jun 30 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"If you really carefully choose things that will be small and light to send, it's really not too bad (I speak as someone in Australia who always picks international!). Postcards, light snacks, bookmarks, little stuffed toys etc are really not that expensive to send to most places. But if you're sending cans or bottles of drink, books, ceramics, glass etc it can get insanely expensive insanely fast!"
secretsanta,3bljvv,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"I was talking to someone here who said they have done many international exchanges and weight is the biggest factor. I believe they said 4 lbs. was the magic number (assuming you are shipping from US). Under that and it wasn't too bad ($20 give or take, sometimes way less). It was when they went over that that it started racking up. So I would do a little research, think what might work that would be fun but still light weight and make up your mind after you have given it some more thought."

secretsanta,3blpux,LazyFiiish,2,Tue Jun 30 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it, dude!  :D  .  This was my first Arbitrary Day, and I eagerly 'retrieved' my match as soon as I could. I then spent a good couple of hours one afternoon going over your redditgifts profile and Reddit history, and noting down ideas.  Over the next few days I decided what to buy and ordered them, then I was left waiting for them to arrive. Around this time, I noticed posts popping up on r/SecretSanta already, so left you a message to let you know things were in the works.  I'd already decided what to send for the gag-gift but hadn't found any cheap kites in the local shops. While walking the dog one day I found a discarded ""Happy Birthday"" party hat, had an idea, and pocketed it. When I got home I cut out the shape, raided the kitchen drawer for a few wooden skewers, cut the cord off an old set of blinds and a plastic 'chain' off another, and sellotaped the whole thing together. Then I set to work finding and printing a troll-face.  :) It took a bit of coaxing to get it in that little package but in the end I made it fit.  While waiting for everything to arrive, I found some things around the house that had barely been used but were still good, and luckily usable as gifts. I admit I'd got the 'bug' a bit by now. So I gathered my old Tamagotchi, the replacement batteries I'd got from eBay (I even replaced the battery and placed the little paper strip), a coin-purse I'd bought in Peru, some mobile phone cases that had been left in a drawer and never used, a graze voucher, and a spare Quickey I'd got as a perk from the indiegogo campaign.  After wrapping the Quickey in bubblewrap, I emptied an old matchbox to use as more sturdy packaging, then remembered this post of yours and had an idea.  I put all the matches back in with the package, as padding, and added a cheeky note. Then the bug took me again, and I spent an afternoon scouring the place for suitable packaging and adding layer after layer, finally ending up with a pink and blue monstrosity before calling it a day.  Still a victim of the 'bug' while half-asleep, I came up with the idea of the book. In primary school, we were taught how to make a hand-made book from cardboard, paper and wrapping paper with a bit of glue. So I spent another afternoon crafting the 'fake-pages' box and the cover, and printing the first few 'real' pages. I was going to draw the title directly onto the cover, using a transfer technique to get the lettering right, but it actually pulled the blue colour off!  :-O   Luckily I was able to find an old suspension file with the perfect colour and managed to print the title directly onto that, then glue that onto the book.  Still in ""looking-for-boxes-the-right-size"" mode from the day before, I found an old Shapeworks box from when my brother was a Herbalife distributor. There was just enough room to fit a graze box, so that went in too!  And, yeah, I did a bit o' doodlin'.   :D  .  I agree, I did spend far too much time, money and thought on this! But it was fun, and it was worth it!  And that's what it's all about!     :D"
secretsanta,3blpux,ulodetero,2,Tue Jun 30 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"Man, I can't stress how amazing it was! And seriously, you put a lot of time into that!!! Anyone who you get next time will be a lucky person! I work I'm retail and that quicktool has been a permanent attachment every day! Glad I know what it's called now! I see there's a hometown one starting. I think I'll join that and try an international send next. I live in a seaside town so I can really have some fun with hometown based souvenirs.

secretsanta,3bjzzh,crazyfordisney,6,Mon Jun 29 21:09:28 2015 UTC,Was tracking provided for any of your exchanges?  If so you can try to match them to the gifts.    Do the ship dates on the packages match the dates that your Santa's marked your gifts as shipped?  Have any of your Santa's contacted you?  If so you can message them by replying to their message to you.  If not you can try to get a message to your various Santas by editing your exchange preferences and your Santas will be notified of the change and they may go back to see what has changed and then contact you.
secretsanta,3bjzzh,charliehaven,7,Mon Jun 29 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"Unless your Santa has already messaged you, you can't send them a message directly.

secretsanta,3bjtn3,A-Nonny-Mouse,2,Mon Jun 29 23:12:12 2015 UTC,I would be delighted to be paired with a kid. Shopping for kids is the best!
secretsanta,3bjtn3,chicagoliz,2,Mon Jun 29 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"I've done an exchange where a parent had signed up her child, and it was a lot of fun."
secretsanta,3bjtn3,pmf1985,2,Mon Jun 29 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"Not weird at all! I actually got matched once with a person who was participating for her special-needs niece, and I had a blast shopping for kid stuff! I just wish they would have posted how the niece liked her present, because I don't even know if she got to open it or anything. :("
secretsanta,3bjtn3,beachkriscat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:31:06 2015 UTC,"I've done one for my daughter, and will probably do the Anime/Manga one for her too. So long as you put it in your profile it's fine."
secretsanta,3bjtn3,krozaline124,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:55:19 2015 UTC,I did the keychain exchange a little while back and told my santa that it was all going to be for my niece as she has quite a collection. It went great! She got TONS of keychains!

secretsanta,3bhi14,livecontent,31,Mon Jun 29 07:00:25 2015 UTC,"I was so sad this morning. I've been trying to find a job, any job for a month and a half now and I knew that if I didn't I wouldn't be able to participate in this round. This morning came and no job. So sad. I didn't even want to look at this page to see what the new exchanges were.  This afternoon I rechecked the town job board and realized I hadn't applied at my favorite bakery/pizza place yet! I knew the manager because he used to shop at the grocery store that I used to work at for groceries for his shop. I went in this afternoon and he told me to stop handing out resumes immediately, not to take any jobs, and that he would call me tomorrow or the next day because he want me to work for him!   ROUND 5 IS BACK ON!!! WOOOOOO! I think I'll sign up for hometown, stickers, comics, and either life's a beach or outdoors, I haven't decided yet! So ecstatic right now! (i'll wait until I'm legit hired though, in case it falls through but still, I HAVE HOPE!)"

secretsanta,3bhi14,Kisaoda,33,Mon Jun 29 12:50:51 2015 UTC,Did you not read the fine print of your Japanese manual?  It's right there on page 37.
secretsanta,3bhi14,FliryVorru,26,Mon Jun 29 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why it's next to the paragraph about self-warming toilet seats..... but yes, you're right! It's right here.  I shall sign up presently."

secretsanta,3bhi14,Major_Nom,5,Mon Jun 29 12:07:53 2015 UTC,I know right? I'm very excited for stickers as well! I already have so many tabs open of online stickers store!
secretsanta,3bhi14,thatsabitraven,2,Mon Jun 29 12:20:32 2015 UTC,What sticker stores might they be? I'm new to sticker love.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Major_Nom,2,Wed Jul 1 08:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'm also new to stickers so I just searched for cute Korean or Japanese stickers on google. I looked at yozocraft, on etsy. This store also has some cute stickers."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Kameiko,3,Wed Jul 1 13:07:14 2015 UTC,Haha. I know what you mean. My dad puts them on the envelopes to send out the bills
secretsanta,3bhi14,RuthMargaretB,8,Mon Jun 29 16:38:31 2015 UTC,Kudos to whoever came up with the Hometown idea - it's awesome!

My boyfriend went a little crazy with the kitten stickers and just the other day (over a year later!!!) there are still random kittens stuck to things around the shop :)   edit: forgot to add a link to the sticker awesomeness https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/george-rr-martin-kittens/
secretsanta,3bhi14,Kigurumix,4,Mon Jun 29 21:01:55 2015 UTC,Why thank you! Glad you are still enjoying them
secretsanta,3bhi14,WhisperingDark,7,Mon Jun 29 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in!  Signed up for four this time around, so far..."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Azusanga,7,Mon Jun 29 07:04:54 2015 UTC,This is going to be so bad for my bank balance.  Jewellery and Hometown here I come.
secretsanta,3bhi14,k_princess,6,Mon Jun 29 08:24:51 2015 UTC,I would like to formally apologize for whoever gets me.

secretsanta,3bhi14,chillbill69,5,Mon Jun 29 07:23:43 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I want to do 7. But must limit funds as I spent a fair bit on this round of exchanges and I only did 3.  Jewellery and nail polish are a definite. I'm a girly girl and I actually need the stuff. And jewellery might be small enough to ship in a small envelope."
secretsanta,3bhi14,wulfychick,16,Mon Jun 29 11:24:15 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to say I have to retire from these exchanges. My reason for doing so is a good one though. Just found out my fiancée is pregnant so now along with saving for a wedding we have to save for a new baby, which pretty much means no extra spending money."
secretsanta,3bhi14,dragonsky,11,Mon Jun 29 15:10:29 2015 UTC,Congratulations!  I guess that is an acceptable reason to call it quits for a while.
secretsanta,3bhi14,chillbill69,3,Mon Jun 29 18:22:13 2015 UTC,Sad that you have to sit out for a while - but congrats on the baby and upcoming wedding!!!

secretsanta,3bhi14,LCHA,3,Tue Jun 30 21:08:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words. I'm sure I will return sooner or later (probably later) but need a break for while.  I may do one here and there if it's something awesome but can't do anymore of my massive hauls like I have in the past.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Kigurumix,4,Wed Jul 1 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"Is it my imagination, or did half of the Nail Polish form just disappear? I went back in to check what I'd written, and the only thing left is the generic ""Notes to help your Santa."""
secretsanta,3bhi14,PeachBelle524,3,Mon Jun 29 08:23:14 2015 UTC,Looks like a bunch of them lost all but the first part of the form.   I would suggest that you check back in the morning to completely fill out the form.
secretsanta,3bhi14,PurpleTulip9,5,Mon Jun 29 08:45:42 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but isn't nail polish disallowed from being shipped by USPS?
secretsanta,3bhi14,thatsabitraven,6,Mon Jun 29 11:56:09 2015 UTC,"Nail polish can be shipped domestically, just not internationally, via usps.  ETA: It can be shipped internationally just not via airmail thus it may take longer for gifts to arrive."
secretsanta,3bhi14,LCHA,9,Mon Jun 29 12:03:24 2015 UTC,I feel like this should be listed on the exchange page or something
secretsanta,3bhi14,RoseAxel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:06:28 2015 UTC,I agree.  Maybe post the guidelines from the USPS website or something.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Kigurumix,2,Tue Jun 30 11:59:24 2015 UTC,I'm in Australia and have ordered nail polish from the US many times.
secretsanta,3bhi14,LCHA,2,Mon Jun 29 13:15:00 2015 UTC,Ok. I asked one of the workers because I subscribe to a beauty box and she said that as long as it's ground shipping it's ok because there wouldn't be a pressure change if it were to travel through air.
secretsanta,3bhi14,RoseAxel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:36:59 2015 UTC,Wait I'm in USA I signed up for international should I cancel that and change it to US?
secretsanta,3bhi14,idejtauren,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:46:15 2015 UTC,You can send international it just can't go airmail.  This means it may take some time for your gift to arrive.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Cytonic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:51:53 2015 UTC,Hmm that's a tough call. If you use a different service provider besides USPS you should be fine.
secretsanta,3bhi14,ManderPants,2,Mon Jun 29 20:19:02 2015 UTC,Ok Ty yeah I guess I can do that Amazon etc.
secretsanta,3bhi14,likuypo,5,Mon Jun 29 20:38:52 2015 UTC,Nintendo! Wooooo Number 25? Never been that low before.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Kameiko,3,Mon Jun 29 12:52:16 2015 UTC,Of course the anime and manga and Nintendo exchanges are after Anime Expo. Stillmaysignup.
secretsanta,3bhi14,visitations,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:28:17 2015 UTC,I'm tempted by both too!
secretsanta,3bhi14,PurpleTulip9,3,Wed Jul 1 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to limit myself to four... Obviously hometown is a must (how many of you are thinking international for that one? I already have so many ideas!)  I'll definitely be decorating my cube, at work I'm the person who wrapped up her desk to stop it being all white!!!  Which leaves the other two places between the Great Outdoors, Life's a beach and Jewelry. I live next to a beach so that would be a lovely one, but I love love camping! I also love animal jewelry. I don't think I can afford all of them though..!!! Decisions decisions."
secretsanta,3bhi14,A-Nonny-Mouse,2,Mon Jun 29 08:54:04 2015 UTC,"I am thinking about this, but sending out a box of Savannah's famous salt water taffy would be expensive.  This is a must buy for hometown in my city lol."

(I definitely want to do the hometown one as well.)   I am tempted to do jewelry since I make my own jewelry, and it is small and inexpensive to ship... but I feel like the exchange could get expensive if I was matched with someone who has metal sensitivities.   I also live close to the beach, so I'm thinking that might be best. Sooo many small touristy beach shops near my home, I'm sure I could find something fun to send!   Hmmm. It's tough!"

secretsanta,3bhi14,cocainelady,3,Mon Jun 29 15:55:27 2015 UTC,Question: I am moving on the 9th of July internationally. I really want to sign up for some exchanges in this round. Will my new address be verified in time for me to participate? I've updated my profile already in anticipation.
secretsanta,3bhi14,dharmaticate,3,Mon Jun 29 10:49:59 2015 UTC,"Will we be able to post ""no gift"" to get credits back before signups for this exchange closes?"
secretsanta,3bhi14,Fluffaykitties,3,Mon Jun 29 11:30:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, there should be enough time to report no gift and get credit back and still sign up for new exchanges."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Fluffaykitties,3,Mon Jun 29 13:15:31 2015 UTC,Same boat.  I dumped all 7 of my points into one exchange last month only to get stiffed AND my match hasn't posted the gifts she got over 2 weeks ago.  I'm a bit salty.
secretsanta,3bhi14,fortnerd,3,Tue Jun 30 15:45:23 2015 UTC,Do we really not match until July 20th for this round?      :(      That seems so far away!

secretsanta,3bhi14,carvedsoap,3,Mon Jun 29 14:36:32 2015 UTC,"I would love to sign up for more, but my wallet says just one, so I signed up for nail polish. I might splurge and sign up for the stickers one too, because shipping that might cost as little as $.55. I'll decide later.   I wish I could close out my Disney exchange, it's been over a week since it was supposed to be shipped and my Santa hasn't pulled my information since the 5th. I don't have much hope that I'll be getting anything. When will reporting no gift become an option?"

I didn't sign up for it but I'm thinking about it, and I'm debating about whether to go with my current hometown where I've lived for 13 years, or my hometown where I grew up, or my birthplace of Philadelphia.  My current hometown is notorious for and actually made the national news for the annual Coming of the Mayflies."

I'm not really feeling any of these exchanges, but I think I'll do hometown.  Crossing fingers and toes that we get each other this time.  I might do Cube too even though I work at home in my loft."
secretsanta,3bhi14,KungFuPup,2,Tue Jun 30 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm debating what to sign up for this round. Nothing is calling at me, but I have the kids home with me so shopping is a viable option. Maybe I'll do hometown for the NYC aspect, see what I can pick up that's super touristy."
secretsanta,3bhi14,onyxpup7,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:51 2015 UTC,Because the bridge was shut down or did the Mayflies wreak havoc on ANOTHER city?
secretsanta,3bhi14,ours_de_sucre,2,Tue Jun 30 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, because the bridge was shut down, and they're still turning the lights off at night, I think.  I actually called it the Mayflypocalypse because people were freaking out."

secretsanta,3bhi14,Tea__Rex,6,Mon Jun 29 18:29:14 2015 UTC,The sticker exchange is a zero credit exchange so the $20 suggested spending amount doesn't apply.  The goal is to send a thoughtful gift that your giftee will enjoy.
secretsanta,3bhi14,PurpleTulip9,0,Mon Jun 29 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"I checked a couple of minutes ago and I could swear the ""we recommend spending $20 on your gift"" rule was on the exchange's page, but now I can't find it anymore. Maybe I misread?  Thanks for the help!"

secretsanta,3bhi14,Aerrianna,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:48:15 2015 UTC,Yes! Exactly. What's worse is when they do in fact overlap and I'm left to decide if I should let him get it or me. Ran into that dilemma a few times!

It was awesome once we put two and two together."

I know there's the standard $20 suggestion, but if my giftee only lists fancy tastes I don't want to be a bad Santa but..."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Jammers789,5,Mon Jun 29 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"If they only list things like Tiffany's then you're supposed to report it to the mods. Most people will give a range of options.  I mentioned my Pandora bracelet, for example, but I also included a bunch of other things I'd love to get like earrings. I feel slightly bad because I can't wear really cheap jewelry without breaking into a rash but luckily sterling silver and surgical steel aren't pricey! I'd say go for it, if someone only lists big brands then report them to the mods."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Justice_Prince,4,Tue Jun 30 00:13:25 2015 UTC,Does Pandora have anything for $20 LOL.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Jammers789,2,Tue Jun 30 12:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do. But my mentioning it wasn't like... The bulk of what I asked for. I literally just put one or two sentences with the names of the charms I'm collecting. It was more of a mention in case I get the ceo of Pandora or something, haha."
secretsanta,3bhi14,Justice_Prince,0,Tue Jun 30 12:43:37 2015 UTC,Nicely done!  LOL.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Jammers789,2,Tue Jun 30 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"Where to do you normally purchase sterling silver jewelry? (just in case I decide to participate and get someone with similar requirements) From my experience, they're usually in about the $30 minimum range?"
secretsanta,3bhi14,Justice_Prince,0,Tue Jun 30 01:17:42 2015 UTC,Oh jeez it's been awhile since I shopped for jewelry. I've had luck at department stores like Jc Penney or Macy's with a coupon. Kohls too (especially with my Kohls charge) Some etsy users will offer it as well. I think even places like hot topic will at least offer surgical steel.   Edit: Oh! Even Claires sells earrings that are nickel free I believe.
secretsanta,3bhi14,Emlily91,2,Tue Jun 30 10:55:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, well, nickel free and sterling silver / surgical steel are almost polar opposites in the price range line. Sterling settles in around the $30+ range and surgical steel sits right under that. If nickel is the problem, there are base metal jewelry (cheap jewelry) which are also nickel free, so would those still break you out?"
secretsanta,3bhi14,m1lkq,0,Tue Jun 30 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately with me it depends. Like my hands are completely fine with nickel free, but my neck gets a huge rash unless it's gold or silver. My ears usually need to be gold, silver or surgical steel. I think some nickel free has been okay as long as I don't wear it daily.   Not sure if maybe it's location specific, but target has sterling silver earrings for 12 bucks, so it doesn't have to be over 30!"

secretsanta,3bhi14,AbruptlyBlue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you specify in your notes to your Santa that you have to have nickel-free metals. It would be even better if you could specify some metals that you know you're generally OK with (or not OK with), as well.  For example, many people think surgical steel is nickel-free, but it's not. It might be OK depending on how sensitive you are to nickel, but, for example, if you know surgical steel doesn't work for you, but niobium and titanium do, you can put that in your notes to your Santa."

secretsanta,3bjh8n,heeeeellooooonurse,4,Mon Jun 29 19:33:58 2015 UTC,Thats what I was worried about.  My giftee has very sporadic posting history on reddit (last 2 posts being 5 days ago and 4 months ago).  I just wanted to make sure I covered my ass as I signed up for a tiered exchange and didn't want to lose all my credits.

Touchnote is a really great way to introduce yourself to your Santa. You load up your own photo and they make it into a postcard and they mail it out directly. It is $2. You could make a collage postcard using a few photos as well.   Go check out the gallery from the last Hometown exchange and get more ideas!"
secretsanta,3bijpr,McMulrick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:10:02 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! This gave me so many more ideas!
secretsanta,3bijpr,Blubberdieblub,3,Mon Jun 29 15:12:08 2015 UTC,"I thought of exactly the same thing. Walking around the town taking a few pictures, I would love to get these. The medium probably doesn't matter too much, even uploading to imgur or printing them on normal paper would be fine. A custom postcard doesn't cost too much (2$ or less online) and that's a nice personal touch. You could create a video montage and upload it to Youtube, or create a portfolio website (there are free and easy options available). But I'm not sure this is necessary. Anyway, I would love to receive photos of someone's hometown!"
secretsanta,3bijpr,Kigurumix,2,Mon Jun 29 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"It's good to know that someone would like that!  I found some coupon codes for super cheap prints, so if they're thrown away, whatever. I only spent a couple of bucks.  I think I need to wait to get my giftee's information before I get too ahead of myself. I'm doing way too much planning at the moment haha"
secretsanta,3bijpr,lilmissRoja,3,Mon Jun 29 15:06:59 2015 UTC,That is a good idea.  Nothing is more frustrating than pre planning what you are going to do for an exchange and find out it won't work for your match.
secretsanta,3bijpr,lilmissRoja,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:50 2015 UTC,what about a scrap book?
secretsanta,3bijpr,k_princess,2,Mon Jun 29 18:07:31 2015 UTC,I was thinking about it
secretsanta,3bijpr,vampedvixen,2,Mon Jun 29 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think that would be so neat. Maybe I'll do that this year, because I'm not physically at home right now."
secretsanta,3bijpr,vampedvixen,2,Mon Jun 29 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great idea! I would love to get some snapshots of your favorite places. I wouldn't make a 14x16"" framed poster without asking first, though."
secretsanta,3bijpr,charliehaven,2,Mon Jun 29 16:41:26 2015 UTC,Haha I think a poster is a little excessive
secretsanta,3bijpr,dinsette,2,Mon Jun 29 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it would be cute to buy a stuffed animal, then take pictures of the stuffed animal all around the town, then print one of those photo books with the pictures in it. Mail both the stuffed animal and the photo book to them. If you do it right, it can be under $20.  Here's a travel journal I did with my friend's stuffed animal when I went to Maine because he couldn't come but his bunny could.  It would be like this but with more hometown and then getting the stuffee animal in the end (I wound up keeping my friend's bunny for a while before I gave it back to him, lol) http://vampedvixen.livejournal.com/524139.html"
secretsanta,3bijpr,charliehaven,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:44:36 2015 UTC,That's an excellent idea! I think I'd have to make sure I'm getting someone that would appreciate that kind of thing though. I'll keep that in mind!
secretsanta,3bkf51,vampedvixen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:08:23 2015 UTC,I'd know exactly what to get you. Too bad I'm not doing to beach exchange XP
secretsanta,3bkf51,LucidDreamer18,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:32:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, oh, oh... what is it? What is it? I like window shopping gifts just as much as real ones :)"
secretsanta,3bkf51,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jun 29 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"Haha Okay, I don't have specifics, but I would try to send a little care package full of momentos to remind you of home :)"
secretsanta,3bkf51,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jun 29 23:54:48 2015 UTC,Awwwwwww... I love it! Thank you for my pretend gift :)
secretsanta,3bl1xt,TVsNoah,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:21:12 2015 UTC,SO.  Great.  Awards given!  =)
secretsanta,3bl0s5,cheshire_cat_99,4,Tue Jun 30 02:11:16 2015 UTC,"I personally would include Ghibli in your information because I consider it anime, even if it's kind of its own brand. There's usually some good merch with those films (art books, posters, plushies etc) so why not give your SS a possible route to take? It couldn't hurt. :3"
secretsanta,3bl0s5,Genkaichan,2,Tue Jun 30 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"So I guess my main question is though is if I only like studio ghibli, would it be unfair to join the exchange since its somewhat restricting? I mean I like other random animes but not enough to join the exchange."
secretsanta,3bl0s5,Genkaichan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm...you may want to sit out then.   If I was your SS, I'd be okay with sticking to a SG theme for you but at the same time, someone else might be hard pressed or disappointed not to be able to branch out with your other anime/manga themed interests.  I'm not sure...I'd say, give it a go but if you're uncertain, you could just add that you prefer SG but could have 1-2 back up interests? If you are on the prowl for SG though and would really just want that, waiting would still be your best bet so you're not looking forward to something and just getting disappointed by something else."
secretsanta,3bl0s5,zils,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:24:00 2015 UTC,Yeah thats what I was thinking too. Especially since there has been a SG exchange in the past I am sure they will eventually have another one! fingers crossed
secretsanta,3bl0s5,BuddhasCat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for it if you want, I consider Ghibli anime.  You get to tell your Santa your likes and dislikes and if you put down Ghibli as your favorite anime then your Santa should use that to find the perfect gift for you."
secretsanta,3bkzgy,ggbmbr,3,Tue Jun 30 02:00:52 2015 UTC,"You can participate as a couple, but you can't expect someone to buy you two gifts.  The recommended amount to spend is still $20 regardless as to how many people it is for.  I would make it clear in your profile that you do not expect multiple gifts.  Matching is random and there is not a way to match one couple up with another couple."
secretsanta,3biel4,iamusingbaconit,2,Mon Jun 29 14:03:21 2015 UTC,Can you give some insight on what a crazy sticker collector would love as a gift?
secretsanta,3biel4,EmberHands,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"I would say it is also depending on their likings? Technically I haven't met another crazy sticker collector yet, hopefully through this exchange I will meet some like minded people. Though I would say maybe some rare or special type of stickers (something that's not common) and of course a collection of a certain theme sticker would be nice, especially the theme that your giftee loves.    Here are some sections of my collection, for me, I consider the first two as the special type - holographic surfaces, embossed text. Then, the third one with the everlast and converse collection, it was a gift from a friend and I like it very much. Treat it like getting a gift for a stamp collector.    and as you may notice, I collect them in albums than sticking it on laptops, skateboards, etc. So, it might be different for different collectors."
secretsanta,3biel4,theLily,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at the stickers on Redbubble? There are a load on there and that's where I'm going to order from (I'm going to send a few from home and a few from an Artist friend of mine as well, if they seem interested in the not-so-PC theme of them)"
secretsanta,3biel4,KU7CAD,2,Wed Jul 8 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, am I an idiot? I can't find the sticker exchange."
secretsanta,3biel4,KU7CAD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"Check the current exchanges-sign up now. Nah, I made similar mistake too."
secretsanta,3biel4,NamedForTheLotion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, I get it they don't actually have the word ""sticker"" in the image, you have to hover over it to see it. Thanks."
secretsanta,3biel4,Tea__Rex,2,Mon Jun 29 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"I have a crap load of scrapbooking stickers, but no need for any stickers, so I signed up as a rematch. Hopefully I get someone that's in need of some scrapbooking stickers because they will find themselves inundated with stickers."
secretsanta,3biel4,Tea__Rex,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"I signed up on behalf of my boyfriend for this exchange! I'm not big on stickers, but he's a nerd/artist and loved to stickerbomb public spaces (like tagging, but considerate and easily removable? lol)."
secretsanta,3bijg8,PurpleTulip9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:45:44 2015 UTC,I told myself I will not let myself do any more international exchanges unless I'm 100% certain I can find the item on eBay with free international shipping. I doubled the cost of a pint glass last exchange because I had to ship from the U.S. to Turkey!
secretsanta,3bijg8,LucidDreamer18,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"We signed up for 3/4 of the same exchanges. I considered the cubicle one too, only my cubicle is my desk at home. Still undecided on that one."
secretsanta,3bijg8,SwissMss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:57:34 2015 UTC,LOL...Go for it.  An office is an office and a home office needs love too. :-)
secretsanta,3bihg8,Neville1989,6,Mon Jun 29 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"Nope. There's so many things I could send! I personally feel it would be pretty dumb to get mad about someone requesting you not send food, especially when it's for a medical reason."
secretsanta,3bihg8,LucidDreamer18,2,Mon Jun 29 14:30:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the encouragement! I just signed up! I'm excited!
secretsanta,3bihg8,cantrek,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind. I'm excited about this exchange as I count two very different locations as my hometown (born and raised in the midwest, moved to the east coast for grad school). I'd rather someone ask me not to send food beforehand rather than find out that they couldn't enjoy it after I sent it."
secretsanta,3bihg8,charliehaven,4,Mon Jun 29 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"My AD person said they had lots of food allergies, and requested no food be sent.  So I sent them not-food things :)  There are soooo many other things besides food that can be gifted so I wouldn't worry too much about it!"
secretsanta,3bihg8,Prob_Bad_Association,5,Mon Jun 29 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"I might be a tad disappointed for like, half a second, but that's just because I'm already contemplating all the stuffs I could send from a local brewery, but then I'd quickly get over there it and start contemplating all the other cool stuff to send.  So you should still go for it. :)"
secretsanta,3bihg8,Emlily91,3,Mon Jun 29 16:10:14 2015 UTC,Nope. Would challenge me to think outside of the foodie box I am constantly stuck in lol.
secretsanta,3bihg8,wulfychick,3,Mon Jun 29 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"So many things can be sent that aren't food related .. So I would not be upset at all!  Just make sure you request ""no food"" :)"
secretsanta,3bihg8,McMulrick,3,Mon Jun 29 14:51:08 2015 UTC,NO- there would be nothing to be disappointed about- there are so many things to send other than food! Sign up! :)
secretsanta,3bihg8,Mollinator,3,Mon Jun 29 14:52:10 2015 UTC,There are tons of other cool things you can send from your hometown that doesn't involve food. It wouldn't bother me at all.
secretsanta,3bihg8,randomthoughts91,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:28 2015 UTC,"I have already prepared a list of things that i could send to my hometown exchange giftee , and it doesn't include food , it's totally fine !"
secretsanta,3bi1av,Jayke1981,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:45:53 2015 UTC,I've met that guy. He's a top bloke.
secretsanta,3big4c,hashk,3,Mon Jun 29 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"No arbitrary day gift here, and can't click ""no gift received"" yet. The FAQ says rematching for first round is usually happening by 1 week after ship date. 10 days after ship date.   Wondering if it could be due to loss of elf status. I was elf when the exchanges were started, but not by the end of it!  This is my first time to be forgotten by a Santa. They haven't looked at my info since June 1  Edit: elf"
secretsanta,3big4c,ShayGoes2Work,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:18:13 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. It's frustrating.
secretsanta,3big4c,DrClooney,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"A few hours after posting earlier, mine finally allowed me to click no gift received! Maybe it'll change for you, too!   I had also emailed redditgifts through the contact option."
secretsanta,3big4c,ShayGoes2Work,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:10:14 2015 UTC,Mine did too!! I'm hoping that I get a rematch for AD! My Warner Brothers match said they shipped but I've still received nothing. I'm hoping that changes soon too.
secretsanta,3big4c,DrClooney,2,Tue Jun 30 02:13:01 2015 UTC,Warner Bros has 8 Dreamworks has 14 Adult Swim has 23 Pixar has 31 Reddit Turns 10 has 41

secretsanta,3big4c,ageorge03,2,Mon Jun 29 17:36:00 2015 UTC,well Disney had 171 so it's got a lot of potential.

secretsanta,3big4c,katbsynyster,2,Tue Jun 30 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"It does. Then when the gifts you send don't even get a thank you, or a photo... It's really heartbreaking because you spend money on them, only to not hear anything back. :("
secretsanta,3big4c,DrClooney,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:06:59 2015 UTC,I was able to report my gift as not received just now. Perhaps try again?

secretsanta,3bftmi,welmoed,3,Sun Jun 28 21:10:57 2015 UTC,I just love your funny description and picture... you're a great giftee!  Bravo!
secretsanta,3bi61a,michaelNXT1,2,Mon Jun 29 12:38:04 2015 UTC,I will also be including light novels in my list :)
secretsanta,3bi61a,BrownSugarSandwich,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:02:56 2015 UTC,I would assume so.

secretsanta,3bjgks,DarlingDestruction,2,Mon Jun 29 18:51:28 2015 UTC,You could always ask your giftee if they would be okay with handmade stuff.
secretsanta,3bjgks,TheOpus,2,Mon Jun 29 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"I would like something like that.  I was thinking about buying a present and making one...so if they don't like the handmade one, they have something else.   It definitely wouldn't offend me or seem cheap, but I too, am a crafty person!"
secretsanta,3bjgks,chat_lunatique,2,Mon Jun 29 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"Different strokes for different folks. Some people might be happy with a paracord bracelet, others could feel ripped if they don't get diamond earrings (but lets hope those people are in the minority).    Either of my sisters would love something like your example, but I don't think that my brothers-in-law or I would wear/use something made of cloth/silk/string/wire. In my experience, most guys who wear jewelry tend to wear subtle, understated items, and only a few at a time. That doesn't eliminate handmade items, though: Leather bracelets are popular, I have a rosary I sometimes wear made from a leather thong and bone beads, and the guys over at /r/Silvercasting would probably be pretty dang popular in this exchange."
secretsanta,3bjgks,Lord_Firestorm,2,Mon Jun 29 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think those bracelets are lovely, but I always put in my profile that I'm happy with homemade stuff because I myself am so lacking in any crafty talents. If your giftee doesn't note that in their profile, might be good to ask just to be sure."
secretsanta,3bjgks,DivaJen,2,Mon Jun 29 20:57:25 2015 UTC,"I think most handmade jewelry is a little tacky, unless you're an experienced seller. What you posted is nicely done but I wouldn't like to receive it. Make sure it fits the likes and dislikes of your giftee!"
secretsanta,3bjgks,Killerchark,2,Mon Jun 29 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"Always ask, I made a nice beaded necklace as a gift for an exchange earlier this year. The Giftee posted no photo and a little brief thanks for it and other items I sent. A few weeks later I got a note from her off of Reddit saying they were not jewelry people and that they were going to sell the necklace and how much was it worth. I did not mind that they were passing the gift on, it was just an odd experience. I would think in the jewelry exchange, it would be fine, but you never know!"
secretsanta,3bjgks,JelloGirli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:08:38 2015 UTC,"I think you better ask your giftee , or check if they like handmade stuff first , They are indeed lovely but alot of people have different tastes ."
secretsanta,3bjgks,randomthoughts91,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:05:43 2015 UTC,"I LOVE handmade jewelry. I'm signing up for the jewelry exchange and secretly inside, I hope my santa makes jewelry as a hobby. I think the time, effort, and love that goes into a piece is so much better that something I just picked up in a shop. It has a story. But, I think it would be a good idea to ask your giftee about it if they don't already let you know that they enjoy handmade stuff."
secretsanta,3bht89,Jayke1981,2,Mon Jun 29 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"I only did comics and hometown.

The purchaser will have to figure it out once they realize that they never got their earbuds (because you have no way of contacting all of your past santas).

secretsanta,3bjcaq,criticalinnervoice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:26:56 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I thought might have happened... Which is why I figured if I posted here maybe one of my ex santas might figure out the error.... :)

secretsanta,3bjcaq,TheOpus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:04:53 2015 UTC,"Well, that's weird.  If your gifters say that it wasn't them, then I guess that rules them out.  Do you participate in any other gifting subreddits?"
secretsanta,3bjcaq,TheOpus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:24:03 2015 UTC,Nope! Just redditgifts.... so I guess at this point I'm just looking for a way to backtrack a package I didn't order and don't know the sender of... or if I should be worried that some headphone bandit is going to try to strangle us in our sleep or something and they were just sending supplies ahead of time :P haha

secretsanta,3bgv6u,thatgirlsthings,2,Mon Jun 29 06:19:14 2015 UTC,Ohhh Mine took quite a while to post hers up!! If you sent your shipment in then your fine. Otherwise i'd add your shipment details so it can count as it's completed. Might take a little while for them to receive the package ive read some redditors it takes up to 3 months to get their gift due to customs
secretsanta,3bgv6u,angelxox,2,Mon Jun 29 06:23:35 2015 UTC,"I've been through the delayed gallery posting/marking recieved thing before. I know the drill, lol.

It's really frustrating when you're hoping they received it, but you never see or hear anything back.  I had one SS say they shipped my gift, yet it doesn't say how or have a tracking number. I have yet to receive anything from that exchange. My Arbitrary Day exchange is another one where the SS was sending me random messages about ""waiting for the gift to arrive"" to ""making sure the gift is the right one"", to nothing. Not shipped, nothing. It's one of the exchanges that I did the Super Plus, so I was really hoping that this one would come through for me, but as of now, I've received nothing.

secretsanta,3b9fd1,YordlePoro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:23:53 2015 UTC,Oh no! Just call ahead of time and make sure you can!  I hope your surgeries go well.
secretsanta,3b6w1f,Prisaneify,4,Fri Jun 26 13:29:13 2015 UTC,"I really doubt you are a shitty santa. I'm sure you're not a shitty person. We all really want that amazing response that your giftee made but, unfortunately, not many people really commit themselves to opening up enough for such a response. Just the fact you care enough to really think about what to get them shows you aren't shitty.  Plus, what you sent her... definitely not shitty! Never judge yourself on the reactions of others. You will almost always come away feeling bad. Just believe in yourself."
secretsanta,3b6w1f,hobbesthestuffed,2,Fri Jun 26 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"Aw, I'm glad you had a cool giftee!  That's the only part of arbitrary day I'm a bit bummed about.  I had a giftee who listed likes I knew absolutely nothing about, so I did a ton of research and tried to pick something out they'd really like, but when they posted that they received it, their post was literally just one line stating what it was and a pic of the item.  I had known they weren't the type to write out a whole story, and that's fine, but adding a ""thanks, I liked it"" or even, ""not my favorite, but I appreciate the effort"" would've been nice.  As it is, I can only assume they hated it and had nothing nice to say, so didn't say anything.  Which I guess is nice in itself that they weren't mean about it, but I tried so hard, so its kind of sad."
secretsanta,3b6w1f,Prob_Bad_Association,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Rin, I already thought so highly of you that I wanted to send you and your bug a little something to show my gratitude for the AMAZING gifts that you sent to me in the bookmark, 2015 exchange. I was doing one last search for your profile before I sent your thank you gifts that I came across this post. Damn it woman, you're killing me with kindness!!! Lol ;) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that you and Shannon have a little something coming from me from Amazon. I just ordered it today, so it hasn't shipped yet. However, I wanted to build your suspense a little.  And after seeing this post I wanted to make sure you saw my reply. Therefore, I am posting my reply in this post (as well as in my original ""thank you"" post) to ensure that you saw it. So, here it is,  ""Prisaneify, your gifts to me were so amazing that I know in my heart that everything you've ever sent to anyone was equally awesome!! You can't judge your gifts on your giftee's reaction or thank you posts. Not everyone knows how to express their gratitude in words. And some people just aren't writers. And if you happen to be gifting to someone who is not very expressive in words OR in writing, it may come across a little generic. By the way, I have to remind myself the same thing. I have sent what I thought were the most amazing gifts and I either didn't even get a thank you, or I've received a simple thank you. (Which a simple thank you is still awesome to hear; but when we go the extra mile sometimes we're hoping to get a little more than a simple thank you.) All I can tell you is to keep reminding yourself that you know in your heart that you tried your best to make someone's day special, and to try your best not to have expectations. We all want that extra mile awesome thank you; but that's not the reason we partake in these gift exchanges. We do it for the gifts...the GIVING of the gifts, that is. HA! I bet I had you there for a second. Lol No, but really, I understand where you're coming from. Just remember that you, too, are an amazing woman; and I appreciate you enough for everyone!!""  So, there you have it. Proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that you truly are both an amazing woman AND an amazing Santa. And if anyone has anything different to say...well, you just send them to me and I'll take care of them. Lol ;)"
secretsanta,3b6w1f,iLive2Rescue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:26 2015 UTC,You are ridiculously sweet. You really didn't have to send us anything. YOU were the giftee :)  I am so happy that I did good with this exchange :) I like to give and I like to make people happy so it was definitely a nice change in procedure here.  I'll be making sure to thank you once our surprise arrives :)

secretsanta,3b9k0x,Readyaimfire18,2,Sat Jun 27 02:25:00 2015 UTC,Your exchange is marked as completed because you have done everything that you need to do to complete an exchange.  You will receive an email with a link when your giftee posts in the gallery.
secretsanta,3b8d1x,blueberry1234,2,Fri Jun 26 20:07:12 2015 UTC,It sucks when both your original giftee and your elves giftee don't post their thank you's.

I signed up as a regifter for a two exchanges, one I was participating in normally (umbrellas) and the other being one that I wanted to send a gift but didn't want to receive one (My Little Pony). I became aware of the Elf perk after one of those gifts was posted, and as far as I'm concerned it was well worth the price."
secretsanta,3b8d1x,nanniej,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"Wow! This sounds like a great way to become an elf :)  I think this is what I'm going to do because I love shopping for the gift, finding the right thing etc. and I realise that rematching plays an important role in everyone enjoying the gifting process, especially after being shafted myself this arbitrary day and not yet being rematched (fingers crossed!) - I'd like to help someone else whose in that situation too !  Thanks for the inspiration"

secretsanta,3b8d1x,salydra,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:38:56 2015 UTC,I'm going to sign up to rematch too! Feeling so inspired to keep the exchange going & its so much fun shopping for the giftee!

secretsanta,3b7fy3,Billitpro,4,Fri Jun 26 16:07:22 2015 UTC,This can happen sometimes when the original Santa is super late in shipping. You will not be penalized for receiving two gifts. Please post both gifts in the gallery from the respective senders. What some people in this situation choose to do is to sign up to be a rematcher themselves for an exchange as a way of paying it forward.
secretsanta,3b7fy3,TheOpus,2,Fri Jun 26 16:20:03 2015 UTC,How does it work that some people get rematched already? I thought that you still can't mark no gift received.
secretsanta,3b6ow3,Wanderingsidhe,3,Fri Jun 26 12:18:00 2015 UTC,Inglehoffer is good stuff.  I love their course ground mustard on a turkey and swiss sandwich made with 12 grain bread.  That with a can of V8 is one of my standard lunches.

secretsanta,3b4hsk,DrClooney,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"a) laser cut, the area around the lock on a circle; b) to blow up the lock cylinder with a miniature explosive device and a detonator; c) fill in the lock cylinder solution of caustic chemical corroding the interior of lock; d) Drill the lock using a drill made of strong material;  You can stick your knife into the crack between the door mailbox base in the place where the lock stands. Thus, you'll have a lever. With a little strength, and the may succumb to lock and unlock the mailbox. The disadvantage of this method is that the force can deform the mailbox."

If you're going away for any length of time you should always either have someone collect your mail and packages or have the post office temporarily stop delivery. Leaving your stuff out there for a period of time is a bit like saying ""Hey thieves and other unscrupulous persons, I'm not home, so please come rob me and/or trash the property."" You're an idiot if you go on vacation, have a package delivered, and don't have some awareness of the fact that it might get ripped off while you're gone."

I made the mistake of sending a $400 dollar gift for secret Santa many years ago on here and was stupid enough not to put tracking on it.    So I resent a different gift out of good faith in a months time,  this time with tracking -  gift was signed for,  was marked as never received by the secret Santa recipient.    Its a great scam to get multiple gifts and never get caught.    Apparently the person's word that they never received anything was worth more than the tracking documents for it, and i got banned.    This was like 4 years ago and I am still unable to participate."

I provided a tracking number that could be entered through http://auspost.com.au/track/track.html - Which clearly showed a signed delivery.   I provided a photo of the receipt I got from the post office when I paid for the postage.  I provided photos of the actual gifts that were sent.   Then my case was apparently assesed and not accepted. There is literally nothing else I can provide to show that it was completed now, and the tracking numbers are that old that all I have is a E-Mail from Australia post with the shipping details as they have been archived out of their production systems.   I'll just continue to participate in the Gift Exchanges using my secondary reddit account that has over 18 completed Exchanges now without a single issue.   This was BEFORE the secret santa was even officialy assosiated with reddit so i really doubt that anyone there can do anything except make up excuses.   Its just sad because I wanted to keep everything neatly under this account, but have to subvert the system due to the Admins inability to asses my case properly."
secretsanta,3ayf70,kjbrasda,3,Thu Jun 25 00:56:49 2015 UTC,"Omg, I love this!!!  I love handmade anything, and actually put it in my exchange profiles because I am SO not crafty, but love crafty things... :)  I would love to receive a gift like this!"
secretsanta,3ayf70,wulfychick,4,Thu Jun 25 01:24:58 2015 UTC,"Don't give up on doing crafts if it is something you want to do but don't feel like you have talent for it! There is always something out there for you! If you don't feel up to originals, try kits, and remember no one is good the first time (or few dozen sometimes)"
secretsanta,3ayf70,kjbrasda,3,Wed Jun 24 17:04:25 2015 UTC,"I do cross stitch, but that's as far as it goes.  I would like to learn to knit or crochet one day, but there is just no time right now - my days are filled with working, and then chasing after a 2 year old..and then once in a while trying to get that elusive thing called sleep :)  Maybe when life settles down a couple notches, I will see what I can do!"
secretsanta,3ayf70,BMK812,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"I know how that is, got a 3 year old myself. When you get a chance, knittinghelp.com is where I learned."
secretsanta,3ayf70,a1wonder,5,Wed Jun 24 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"Although, I am extremely happy with all the gifts I have received, I would still kill for something original, like this."
secretsanta,3ayf70,crinnie,2,Thu Jun 25 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"It's the start of vacation time around the office, maybe they are just out of town. That's happened to me on a few exchanges. Wonderful gift by the way :)"
secretsanta,3ayf70,Auryslife,2,Wed Jun 24 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is AWESOME!!! I'm sorry they didn't mark it as received, what a shame. Great work!"
secretsanta,3ayf70,cyriouslyslick,2,Wed Jun 24 16:38:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I would have LOVED to have received those gifts! Hopefully, they will decide to post a ""Thanks"" soon!!"

secretsanta,3ayf70,kjbrasda,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"What a shame! I hope it'll be marked as recieved soon. That gift rocks!  I tried redditgifts for the first time some time ago, and I never found my gift to have being marked as recieved either, but I was thinking maybe it wasn't delivered, and I kinda forgot about it again. Also not sure if I know how the whole thing works, but did figure out how to mark my own as recieved at least. I even forgot their username, so I can't even message them, all I remember is that it had no posts or comments on it."
secretsanta,3ayf70,FallingFly,3,Wed Jun 24 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"You should still be able to access old giftees if you click on ""my past exchanges"" on redditgifts and select the exchange you want to review."

secretsanta,3ayf70,burnstyle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:04:24 2015 UTC,I made my persons gift too and they haven't marked it received either!! The tracking says the apartment office has it so I'm hoping it doesn't get lost or stolen. Let's hope they post!!! :)
secretsanta,3ayf70,burnstyle,0,Thu Jun 25 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"awww. one of my giftees never marked their gift received either, and I didn't notice until about a year later.  Because of that I can't do gift exchanges anymore. :(  13 past exchanges down the drain. Hopefully you have better luck."

secretsanta,3b29eq,AvatarS,2,Thu Jun 25 11:36:52 2015 UTC,That is such a nice gift.
secretsanta,3b2pfj,nechoventsi,4,Thu Jun 25 14:14:23 2015 UTC,That's right.  Your exchange is marked as completed because you have done everything that you need to do to complete the exchange.  It does not affect the status of your rematch.
secretsanta,3b2pfj,TheOpus,4,Thu Jun 25 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"So now all I have to do is wait for a gift (as usual), but this time from a Rematch Santa? Thank you very much :)"
secretsanta,3b1h5i,P4li_ndr0m3,9,Thu Jun 25 05:11:12 2015 UTC,"Hawai'i, baby!    As I've mentioned in other threads, Amazon is a good way to save money on shipping if you're doing multiple exchanges, since they offer free shipping on orders over $35 and you can split shipping to multiple addresses. Combine that with some school supplies if you're a little short, or see if you can get a Prime trial as a student, and you should be set."
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Lord_Firestorm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:34:08 2015 UTC,I might do that! I just really like wrapping up the gifts and adding notes. :/
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Genkaichan,6,Thu Jun 25 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"Flat rate boxes are your friends or online shipping. I hope you still had fun, even if your bank account begs to differ!"
secretsanta,3b1h5i,BoldChoices,3,Thu Jun 25 08:28:46 2015 UTC,Flat rate is good if you are shipping something heavy or a very long distance.  I was already to ship flat rate for one of the last exchanges but found out it was a lot cheaper if I shipped regular priority mail with the USPS.  Saved even more by printing the postage at home.
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Emlily91,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:02 2015 UTC,Every time I go to Canada Post to ship a package I tell the teller that I wish we had a flat rate box like the US. Would be so great for exchanges.
secretsanta,3b1h5i,mrvudu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:44:30 2015 UTC,Definitely enjoyed it all up to shipping them!
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Kigurumix,5,Thu Jun 25 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain, I did three exchanges, I'm on the West Coast and all of my giftees were on the East.  I spent about 70 bucks on shipping.  2 Fedex, 1 UPS, nothing special shipping fyi."
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Kigurumix,3,Thu Jun 25 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"I did two, and one was on same coast as me, but other was a lot closer to you!"
secretsanta,3b1h5i,LoverlyRails,3,Thu Jun 25 07:51:29 2015 UTC,What shipping service are you using and where are you shipping to?
secretsanta,3b1h5i,bellekid,3,Thu Jun 25 07:41:38 2015 UTC,"FedEx, and standard ground. Nothing special and no bells and/or whistles.  Shipped across country, but damn."
secretsanta,3b1h5i,hyrulian_rider,9,Thu Jun 25 07:51:07 2015 UTC,"Never use FedEx or ups, you will always pay so much more than usps."
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Snowy1234,3,Thu Jun 25 08:06:39 2015 UTC,I learned that the hard way today! I can usually ship out 2 or 3 packages for $20!
secretsanta,3b1h5i,Iwantbubbles,3,Thu Jun 25 08:13:31 2015 UTC,Absolutely!  UPS quoted me $60; USPS did it for $7.
secretsanta,3b1h5i,lainzee,3,Thu Jun 25 13:25:50 2015 UTC,Yikes! See if any store cards you use offer free shipping as a perk.  I have a Target RedCard and get free shipping on Target.com with it for all orders. One of my gifts for the most recent swaps ended up weighing 11lbs and was shipped free due to paying with my card. (And shipped via FedEx no less which saved me a ton.)  Some sites also offer free shipping with their loyalty programs. I've used fanatics.com for sports related swaps and never paid for shipping through theirs.
secretsanta,3b1h5i,tinyvoid,2,Thu Jun 25 16:54:02 2015 UTC,Ya I need to stop doing international matches. $100 for salt and pepper shakers.
secretsanta,3b0rmo,kimwim42,4,Thu Jun 25 01:21:08 2015 UTC,You might be able to get a better deal ordering from the German Amazon.
secretsanta,3b0rmo,mrpanadabear,0,Thu Jun 25 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Too late, and I figured this was so close, dammit. Just, why so expensive?"
secretsanta,3b0rmo,KungFuPup,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:33:52 2015 UTC,Likely because it's going to go on a plane to get there.  Royal Mail standard post for a parcel of 1kg from the UK to Germany is £8.26.  It's 20p cheaper by boat but that takes up to 15 days.  It's got to go over the English channel somehow.
secretsanta,3b0rmo,po0rdecision,2,Thu Jun 25 09:21:30 2015 UTC,Gotta pay the poor postal carriers wages.  I feel for mine. I ordered a 30 lb bag of dog food on Amazon today.
secretsanta,3b0rmo,Lord_Firestorm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the only parcel he'll deliver that day."
secretsanta,3b0rmo,salydra,3,Thu Jun 25 08:39:07 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that he'll be delivering instructions for picking it up at the post office...
secretsanta,3b0rmo,Moneygrowsontrees,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:47:37 2015 UTC,"I regularly order my dog food (35lb), cat food (30lb), and cat litter (40lb) from Amazon. I also do bulk orders for household goods like toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, etc that aren't really heavy but huge boxes. My carrier has to loathe me by now."
secretsanta,3b0kuh,phazes,3,Thu Jun 25 00:23:23 2015 UTC,I would contact ThinkGeek.  They have great customer service.
secretsanta,3b0kuh,TheOpus,2,Thu Jun 25 01:09:28 2015 UTC,"I don't want to contact them right away without hearing from my santa first. If he doesn't respond in a couple of days, then I'll contact them."
secretsanta,3b0kuh,Diarygirl,2,Thu Jun 25 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"That's what all the comments say, that they're great at replacing things.  You'd think somewhere along the line someone would say ""Hey, maybe we should package these things better."""
secretsanta,3b28hk,randomthoughts91,3,Thu Jun 25 11:24:04 2015 UTC,If you take a look at the sidebar there's a link for the calander which shows the exchange dates.

NAKED BONES EVERYWHERE AND JUST DELICIOUS TENDER MEAT AND IT'S ALL IN MY BELLY AND I MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO FASTEN MY JEANS AGAIN.  Totally worth it. Amazing. Thank you."

secretsanta,3aw1mo,txteva,2,Wed Jun 24 12:17:23 2015 UTC,There's been a few people who've given out Disney trips as gifts in the past so it's most likely a 'real person'
secretsanta,3aw1mo,makinmagic,2,Wed Jun 24 12:38:26 2015 UTC,I'm a WDW and we get free tickets once or twice a year year depending on our status. We can use them ourselves or donate them or gift them to people. It's completely plausible for  regular ole person to do this if they have them available. I'm all out or my giftee would have received one :(

secretsanta,3azhft,_roca,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:17:29 2015 UTC,Many thanks to the generous person who sent me these wonderful works. I recently relocated after a tough few years. The plan was to do some healing through reading and time spent near the ocean. Thank you for taking care of half of the prescribed medication :)
secretsanta,3ayl0d,mpjanning,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:33 2015 UTC,I'm glad you like it! It was fun being a part of Arbitrary Day this year and I think I'll do it again at Christmastime. I want to know how that shaving soap is when you get around to it. Happy Arbitrary Day!
secretsanta,3azus7,DrDebG,2,Wed Jun 24 20:57:20 2015 UTC,What a cool gift!! Kumara  is the best :)  Edit: Kumara not Kumar...autocorrect
secretsanta,3axxjz,RunnyBabbitRoy,21,Wed Jun 24 11:44:21 2015 UTC,"You should be fine. Just provide shipping proof when you do send.  On a more personal note, have you ever visited /r/personalfinance ? I don't mean to sound like I'm judging at all, but you might want to reconsider voluntary gift exchanges if you find yourself borrowing money to buy the gift. /r/personalfinance is full of a lot of great people and a lot of great information about getting your financial house in order and helping break the paycheck to paycheck cycle."
secretsanta,3axxjz,Moneygrowsontrees,3,Wed Jun 24 12:38:24 2015 UTC,"The important thing is that you sent it at all. It's better to ship on time, but people are not really punished for shipping late, as long as they ship."
secretsanta,3axxjz,salydra,2,Wed Jun 24 12:38:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, just message your giftees so they know that you've not forgotten and send the gift as soon as you can."
secretsanta,3axxjz,Beard_sniffer,2,Wed Jun 24 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, please please message them. You can do it anonymously on the retrieve match page. There is a large button near the bottom."
secretsanta,3axxjz,knotty_pretzel_thief,2,Wed Jun 24 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"At least you sent yours. I've been doing exchanges for years, but unless something changes it looks like I'm going to get screwed for the second time in a row. I even did Arbitrary Day Super Plus or whatever it was! I really enjoy reddit gifts, but if this happens one more time I just can't do it anymore, and it makes me really sad."
secretsanta,3axxjz,DrClooney,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand!!! I've heard nothing from my Warner Brothers Secret Santa and two others have yet to contact me as well. Did Super Plus... Ugh. Really, really hoping I don't get shafted."
secretsanta,3axxjz,RoseAxel,2,Wed Jun 24 15:40:31 2015 UTC,You will be fine! The most important thing is to contact your giftee just to let them know that you're a week behind. I was actually late a few days as well for my exchanges this time  only because I ordered them something through Etsy and it took a week longer than it was supposed to get too me..had I shipped to them directly it would've been fine but I had a lot more stuff to add to their package so I just let them know and they were fine with it .
secretsanta,3b0b9k,JackBurke24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:17 2015 UTC,I think it's at the bottom or near the bottom of the page.
secretsanta,3aycln,lcarosella,3,Wed Jun 24 14:14:21 2015 UTC,Sign ups for the new batch of exchanges start on Monday but matching isn't until July 20th.  There is a full three weeks for you to get your current exchanges completed and points back before sign ups close and matching begins.

If a rematcher does not follow through, they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they become ineligible to be rematched themselves on exchanges.

secretsanta,3avek7,chicagoliz,2,Tue Jun 23 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"Ditto. I found an extra cookbook to send to my giftee after seeing it in the gallery, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy another copy for myself of the first cookbook I sent her."
secretsanta,3avek7,BatzCountry,2,Tue Jun 23 21:43:34 2015 UTC,I got a cookbook for Arbitrary Day.  I don't know if it's up your alley but it's something a little different!
secretsanta,3avek7,IAlbatross,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:34:18 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  Looks like a cool cookbook!
secretsanta,3auk9d,cocacolaguy,3,Tue Jun 23 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"This was from me! I'm actually from Liverpool myself, glad you like it :)"
secretsanta,3auk9d,keigums,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:16:46 2015 UTC,I cannot be alone in wondering...  What is it? :D  Edit: Need to get my glasses checked. It's clearly a phone case. I'm we-tard-ed.
secretsanta,3awspi,slothsaremajestic,2,Wed Jun 24 03:18:38 2015 UTC,Bookmarks was a 0 credit exchange.
secretsanta,3awspi,charliehaven,2,Wed Jun 24 03:28:08 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense. Still new to this sorry and thanks!
secretsanta,3awspi,charliehaven,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:03:45 2015 UTC,No problem!
secretsanta,3awspi,voxhavoc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:04:35 2015 UTC,Don't you get a credit anyways though for completing it?
secretsanta,3awspi,Silent_Ogion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:40:15 2015 UTC,You're supposed to.
secretsanta,3au3zj,idejtauren,2,Tue Jun 23 14:59:15 2015 UTC,It's a good challenge to play through their missions. If you do those as they open up you can upgrade your gear in the single player campaign to help beat the final levels as all orange globes collected in amiibo challenges count towards the campaign.
secretsanta,3ax390,Heremeow,2,Wed Jun 24 05:02:31 2015 UTC,"So, I really can't pick favorites as I have been graced with such amazing Santa's in all the exchanges I have participated in thus far, so to do this in a fair matter I decided to tell you about two very special exchanges to me. These are the links and my reasoning behind them.  https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/my-santa-made-my-sister-smile/  I believe my Santa for the yarn exchange deserves all the love and appreciation for the gift she gifted my sister. I had signed up using all my sisters information because she has participated in non-reddit yarn exchanges before but was always shafted, I wanted to change that. My Santa completely took care of her and showed her the true spirit of the Reddit Community,  I cannot thank her enough for what she did for my sister. I have never seen my sister so happy, she was blown away to know a conplete stranger would do something so nice for her.   https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/amazing-gift-290/  I believe My Secret Santa 2014 Santa deserves this because they went above and beyond all expectations I had. This was my very first Redditgifts exchange and they completely hooked me into a spiraling addiction (more exchanges :p) Because of their complete and utter thoughtfulness I have found a love for these exchanges and have participated in as many as I could the following rounds!    If I could tell you about all the exchanges I've done I would be here all night raving about how great everyone has been. But alas, I had to narrow it down and I think these two are great examples that deserve more loving."
secretsanta,3ax390,TheGingerPigeon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:36:55 2015 UTC,Done!
secretsanta,3ax390,TheGingerPigeon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:42:03 2015 UTC,Thank you kindly! Very much appreciated :) Enjoy your cake day!
secretsanta,3ax390,TheGingerPigeon,2,Wed Jun 24 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"Here is what /u/weffy posted to another member about when your cakeday award giving powers will begin:   It's a technical limitation: The job that gives cake day powers runs at 6:15 am, and picks up everyone who's cakeday would have started in the last 24 hours if they logged into reddit, gives them the power to give all the awards, and takes away those powers to everyone who used to have those powers. I do it as a job, rather than on each and every gallery page view, because it's less heavy on the servers (is the cakeday flag true? yes? sweeeeeet vs. was this person's account created in the equivalent to the last 24 hours in any previous year? sweeeet).  Also, reddit cakedays shift based on when you log in (I think you have a few days to log in to start getting your cake)."

secretsanta,3awknf,Zelaphas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"Go to the exchange page on redditgifts for the one you are marking as shipped and hit the big square that says ""Mark Your Gift Shipped"", fill in the boxes and submit it.  That should do it."
secretsanta,3av9mn,chillbill69,2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:02 2015 UTC,Your Pints and Shot Glasses exchange Santa has marked it as shipped.
secretsanta,3av9mn,TheOpus,2,Tue Jun 23 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, but I got it like 2 or 3 weeks ago, before they marked as shipped"
secretsanta,3av9mn,criticalinnervoice,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"Of all of the exchanges that you're doing that you have not posted gifts for, I'm going to go ahead and guess that it is Pints and Shot Glasses.  However, you could try putting a note to your gifter in the ""Notes to help your Santa"" section of your profile and see if they get back to you."

secretsanta,3av1ch,BadWolfGirl33,2,Tue Jun 23 19:00:53 2015 UTC,Chances are that your package is actually on the move but is not getting scanned along the way like it should be.
secretsanta,3av1ch,Kigurumix,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"No problems from my end, it delivered today for mine. Make sure you have all the numbers right.... I know that sounds obvious but sometimes i mess up even after about 3 or 4 tries."
secretsanta,3av1ch,magicmanx3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:05:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much. The tracking on one of my gifts never got scanned out of its origin so it miraculously warped all the way from the east coast to California with no stops along the way.
secretsanta,3av1ch,Nirokusan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"Our wonderful postal system doesn't always scan packages at each stop, so it can appear that the tracking number isn't working...it is, it's just not being scanned properly."
secretsanta,3av1ch,charliehaven,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:10:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Mine showed as being in customs for a week and a half and then showed up on my doorstep while it's STILL showing as being in customs on USPS.  It happens.
secretsanta,3avmjj,Prof_X,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:28:29 2015 UTC,Super big nerdy thanks to my Secret Santa.  I had a day today and this really helped pull me up by the ears.
secretsanta,3aupah,GIMME_ALL_THE_BABIES,6,Tue Jun 23 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"The majority of gifts get sent either on the mailing deadline, or in the few days after. We're still in the ""few days after"" period, so yeah, this is pretty normal.  Exchanges generally end up with a 5-10% shafted rate when all is said and done."
secretsanta,3aupah,BatzCountry,6,Tue Jun 23 17:53:52 2015 UTC,The statistics are not terribly accurate because not everyone marks their gift as shipped and some people ship late. The statistics do not really end up being closer to somewhat accurate until several weeks after the shipping deadline.   You will not typically receive feedback about your feedback. Ratings are for admin use only and will not be revealed or made public
secretsanta,3aupah,akitaevita,2,Tue Jun 23 18:05:05 2015 UTC,I hope it isn't... I put 7 points in to this exchange and my Santa hasn't pulled my info since mid-June :(
secretsanta,3aupah,thatoneday_,2,Tue Jun 23 18:30:51 2015 UTC,I feel you.  My Santa hasn't pulled info since the day matches were released.  I wish that people would just not bother pulling info if they weren't planning to complete the exchange - it just delays the whole rematching process and leaves people hanging for that much longer.
secretsanta,3arhyo,criticalinnervoice,7,Mon Jun 22 22:37:11 2015 UTC,I've been checking a ton :P my neighborhood has issues with peeps stealing packages so me and my sibilings are on a 30 minute rotation to look at the front door and mailbox
secretsanta,3arhyo,sportsfanvideojunky,4,Mon Jun 22 23:06:46 2015 UTC,Should set up a camera that only records when there is movement. Catch the person doing it and report it to the police. That's a federal offense.   People messing with other people's mail gets my goat.
secretsanta,3arhyo,Dart06,3,Mon Jun 22 23:17:05 2015 UTC,oh yeah we have 4 cops in our neighborhood street and cameras but its weird man its weird
secretsanta,3arhyo,sportsfanvideojunky,4,Mon Jun 22 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"I have my packages delivered to my parents house because if it's anybody other than Canada post to my house it gets delivered to my neighbours ""for safe keeping"". No thanks! Strangers I don't even know. At least if it's my parents it's left on the front steps which is hidden behind a lot of foliage. Sad part is I don't get to my parents more than once a week. Sorry Santa!  :("
secretsanta,3arhyo,BrownSugarSandwich,3,Tue Jun 23 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"My Pixar and Disney exchange gifts were delivered last Monday. Neither have posted. I sent both a pm asking and 1 replied and said they got it and would post this past weekend. Not yet. The other hasn't replied but was on Reddit a week ago. =( I really need to know that one because it was a custom order from out of the US and if it isn't right I need to get in touch with the guy from Etsy.  But I've submitted shipping proof so if they don't, admins know I did ship."

secretsanta,3arhyo,wulfychick,2,Tue Jun 23 16:24:42 2015 UTC,My package was delivered to my giftee 2 1/2 weeks ago.

There is nothing worse than being ignored after sending someone four gifts....
