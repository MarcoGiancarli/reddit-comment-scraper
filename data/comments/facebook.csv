There may be another easier method tho. I wouldn't know right now, since I'm off Facebook"

facebook,3dooqn,reviveandarchive,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"I would avoid spending money on Facebook ads. Depending on your niche, Facebook and google ads have lost their effectiveness. I used to spend $10,000 a month on ads for Google and $3,000/mo on Facebook years ago. I'm in the IT field. It used to be lucrative, and MIGHT be for you. Without knowing it, I might suggest more research.   That said, I don't know how much you've researched it and where you are at with it. If you're interested in talking more about it I have a lot of experience with purchasing ads and advert's that might be relevant to your field pm me and I'll shoot you my number. I'm always available to help fellow business owners save and make money. Let me show you my Lamborghini in the garage... /s"
facebook,3dooqn,ducrider1199,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:02:56 2015 UTC,"Well I am as a newbie essentially. Advertising budget is whatever I can afford from my pay from my real job lol. Not new to my niche but new to running a business. It's just a small home based business with some potential to make a lot of money but it really needs exposure as many don't think they need it or even know it really exists.   Gets to be fairly overwhelming, very quickly with just keeping up with the social media accounts. let alone advertising. I know facebook and google have likely lost their edge. I have had a ad running on google adsense for about 2 weeks. It's brought traffic to the site, yes but honestly I don't need the traffic, I need the calls lol.   Researching is all I've been doing. Want got ppc, as I think all others aren't as effective. But with that said, a click means shit unless someone calls too. I'll keep at it, it's bound to pay off sooner or later. Thanks bud!"
facebook,3dnr6f,MyWittleSquishies,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:54 2015 UTC,someone is trying to hack your account and failing so it's locking the account..
facebook,3dnr6f,Alacritous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm not sure that's the reason, though. They said something about my account appearing to use a fake name, but it's my name! They asked for my license, but said it's wrong. My last name is below my first and middle, and I'm pretty damn sure they saw my middle name thinking it was my last. I've sent in my school ID, my insurance card, my pharmacy records, and emailed various Facebook departments at least 100 times today. This isn't including the posts I've written on using my daughter's account. I've written the FB engineers, called them and left a message, and I've also wrote on Facebook's wall. I asked this question on Mark Zuckerberg's most recent Q&A, but while everyone else is getting responses, or replies, my problems fall on deaf ears. I can tell they intentionally skipped over my question to say shit like, ""I'm glad you like Facebook"" to other people! This is soooo frustrating especially because I broke NO rules! Even with the license.... they say that my last name wasn't correct. It was. They were looking at my first and middle! Then, I saw where MZ said that Facebook's ToS doesn't REQUIRE a legal name, but a REAL name. Soooo, even if they misread my license, there's clearly a HUGE breakdown in communication between what the rules are supposed to be - or aren't! This is very aggravating! VERY!"
