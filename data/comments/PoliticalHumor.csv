PoliticalHumor,3e2zqn,yhwhx,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, did you know that when a conservative encounters the ""Native American argument"", their takeaway is the exact opposite of that of a liberal?   Everyone agrees on the premise:   The Native American were wiped over a number of generations as foreigners poured into their land. This was a bad thing, certainly for them.   The liberal takeaway:  2a. White people have no claim to North America, anyway, so everyone can come on in!  The conservative takeaway:  2b. If White Americans want to avoid the same fate, we must strictly limit the number of foreigners pouring across our border and onto our shores. This is one of the great lessons of history."

Look at cities like LA, Chicago, NY, and other rock restrictive cities and you will find some of the highest incidences of rock injury and fatalities. Not to mention every single incidence of mass stonings has happened in places where stones are expressly prohibited (""stone free zones"" or we could even call them ""glass houses"").   Even places overseas where stones weren't as widely spread and have been rounded up and taken away from every legal stone owner, stones somehow find their way into the hands of Ner-do-wells looking to cause harm."
PoliticalHumor,3dstzo,Z0idberg_MD,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"Mass stonings aren't the issue. Who said they were?  And, 70% of the stones found in Chicago were brought in from states that had far more relaxed rock laws.  And again, why did you ignore the rock injury rates of other comparable nations?"
PoliticalHumor,3dstzo,RiverRunnerVDB,0,Mon Jul 20 11:43:09 2015 UTC,"70% of the stones found in Chicago were brought in from states that had far more relaxed rock laws.   Yet those states with the relaxed laws, where the rocks were supposedly initially procured, don't have the same levels of rock crime as Chicago. If the relaxed laws and easy access were what caused violence I would think that places where there is less restrictive laws would see higher rates of rock crime, but it is usually the opposite.   I didn't ignore the rock injury rate of other countries. They still have rock injuries despite almost total prohibitions on rock ownership. You know what they have a lot of instead of rock injuries though? Stick injuries. Stick injury and deaths are so bad that you have to be 18 simply to by disposable plastic picnic sticks. There have even been calls for all pointy sticks to be banned.   We don't live in a country where we depend on our government to protect us from ourselves at the detriment of our own personal liberties. Nanny state policies that other countries adopted because their subjects are scared of their own shadows are unacceptable in this country."
PoliticalHumor,3dstzo,Z0idberg_MD,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:40 2015 UTC,"Look (let's drop the act), you aren't making sound arguments. Now you are saying that we are blaming guns for more crime. Where did that come from? Who made that argument? Violent crime has a few major factors: population density, poverty, and education/infrastructure. No one ever said that guns were responsible for violence... what guns do is make violent crime more lethal. Which is a fact. And where did you get a ban from? Who said we want to ban guns? I certainly don't. I want to fix the issue. But we can't even start because people won't even admit to themselves that guns are a part of the problem. Not necessarily guns themselves, but gun availability to criminals. Which would take regulation to solve. Again, the regs in Chicago are WORKING if criminals need to go out of state to get their guns. There is basically a gun laundering service in these states that allow gun shows with no background checks.  Now, on to your point that other nations still have violent crime: Do me a favor, and google London. Then google NYC. Compare them in nearly every way: size (sq mile), population and pop density, infrastructure, immigrant population, education level, economics etc. They are pretty much identical in every way. Now lets look at violent crime. The US does an AMAZING job at reducing violent crime. For example, in London, you are 2x as likely to be the victim of a violent crime than in NYC. The down side to this, is that in NYC, even though their violent crime rate is 2x lower, you are 4x as likely to be the victim of a homicide. Why is that, do you think? Could it be that guns are far more effective at turning violent crime deadly than knives and sticks?  You would recall the incident in china where a man stabbed 20 children the same week as the Batman cinema shooting. People argued that this proved people would still find a way to be violent. Yes, the certainly would. The main difference here is that not a single person in china died from their injuries while 12 people died in the movie theater.  So to sum this up, I never said violence was caused by guns. And I never said I wanted to ban guns. You basically set up a false argument to disagree with. What I want is reasonable, consistent regulation that would allow law abiding citizens to still own their guns, while keeping them out of the hands of criminals. The reason that the gun lobby is opposed to this is that selling to criminals through these laundering channels is big business. They make a LOT of money. So they pump a lot of money into the public sphere to keep people afraid of even sensible regulations."

Wind energy comes from the sun, the sun only dumps so much energy on the earth each day, and eventually the sun will swell up and burn all the air off the planet.    That's like saying tidal energy is finite.   That's also technically true, since tidal forces are powered by gravity and the rotational momentum in the earth/moon/sun system. Eventually the Moon will fall away and the earth will become tidally locked with the Sun, though I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen before or after our air and ocean boil away."

PoliticalHumor,3dsn12,BeartrapSandwich,3,Sun Jul 19 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"What logic are you referring to? Also, Why boats and not windmills?   Anyways, Just because Wind is finite doesn't mean fossil fuels aren't significantly more finite and come with additional negative externalities.   The quote, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down and cause the temperature to go up"" is not scientifically inaccurate. In fact, it's practically a tautology. There's only so much air moving around, taking wind energy out of that system results in a system with less energy, and the second law of thermodynamics mandates the creation of waste heat when making the conversion from Wind to a more humanly useful form of energy.   What is inaccurate is only implied, that Wind is somehow more finite than fossil fuels, that human activity at our current scale could deplete planetary wind energy by a significant degree, or that doing so would measurably raise global temperatures."

Scientists suggest the turbines act as fans to pull warmer air to the surface at night, accounting for most of the warming trend.   The massive wind farms pull down warm air and warm the ground around the wind farms by .72 degrees per decade which is not at all correlative to the picture which states that wind is finite and will warm up the planet. No. it warms up the ground around the wind farm.   Does that add CO2? Does that cause Beijing levels of smog? Does that cause us to check the weather each day to determine if we need a mask today?
