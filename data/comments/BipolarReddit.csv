Only recently have I been able to tell that my coworkers don't want to be anywhere near me for fear of me telling them they're doing everything wrong.

BipolarReddit,3e4d0d,Mcsplasha,4,Tue Jul 21 21:27:03 2015 UTC,you're feeling good because the meds are working. not because your body has changed and the meds have stopped working. please accept that the combo of medication you are on is possibly working.
BipolarReddit,3e4d0d,lola_fox,2,Wed Jul 22 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're going through this.   Why are you on Paxil if you're bipolar? It's one of the most potent SSRIs and can and will induce hypomania, mixed episodes, and manic episodes in people who are bipolar. Arguably, it isn't 100% safe to be on SSRI even if you're on a mood stabilizer in my personal opinion but talk to a doctor.  Meanwhile your other drug which you stopped taking is just an atypical antipsychotic. While it is effective for bipolar disorder, it should likely be used in combo with something like Lithium or Lamcital.  Anyway, you need to find a pdoc with more experience with bipolar disorder. Slowly titrate off the Paxil over the course of several months and try something to even your moods out rather then make them worse.  What just happened to you was likely SSRI induced mania. Don't let it happen again.   Good luck to you. You can get better."
BipolarReddit,3e4d0d,applextrent,4,Tue Jul 21 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"Everyones thresholds for SSRI induced mood swings is extremey varied.  I agree that they should be prescribed with a stabalizer but if they help it may not be neccessary to quit completly. I've found that without some kind of anti-depressant life gets shit pretty quickly.  I've been on SSRI's without a mood stabalizer and although it certainly wasn't ideal I didn't immediatly go into a manic state.  not trying to undermine what you've said, just a different perspective to consider."

BipolarReddit,3e4d0d,aManNamedTruth,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"Again, SSRIs without some kind of stabilizer is not recommended with bipolar disorder.  As my original post mentioned, they can simply induce hypomania in some people (cyclothymia and bipolar type 2 for example). What the op experienced however sounds like a full on SSRI induced manic episode (although type 2 can still experience a type 1 like episode induced by an SSRI so don't think if you're type 2 you're safe from the effects of SSRIs). Most people with bipolar disorder will simply experience a low grade hypomania possibly an occasional mixed episode depending on a wide range of variables. On the other end of the spectrum, they can cause a full blown episode. However, you're mistaken if an SSRI doesn't induce mood variations in bipolar disorder. The entire point of an SSRI is to augment mood, that's kind of the point.  SSRIs are also highly effective at masking the side effects of other meds (many atypicals can actually cause depression or make it worse), which is why they are commonly prescribed in combo with atypical antipsychotics. It is an effective way to boost the mood of patient on a mood stabilizer, the stabilizer then caps the patient from experiencing a full blown manic episode. The SSRI is however still changing the patients energy levels, metabolism, mood cycles, etc.  It is very likely our op here didn't like how the atypicals were capping her mood, wanted to feel something again so she kept taking the Paxil because it was making her manic, and then OD trying to correct the problem she just created when things went out of control.  I have a wide range of opinions on this personally and I could go into them further but for the sake of political correctness and medication compliance for the masses I'm just going to end this comment here."

There have been and are incredibly successful, inspiring people who live with the same thing you do. It's just a fact of life at this point.   Sure, I've had the same thoughts. I feel ashamed talking about it and guilty inflicting it on my friends/family- but that's kind of delusional, don't you think? One wouldn't feel that way about a heart condition.

I started doing yoga and running and psychotherapy and feel better but could probably still use meds...but none seem to work as well as exercise and Sonata when I can't sleep. Seroquel made me feel like I had a concrete jacket on too--Sonata makes me feel like I'm waking up on a cloud... It's tough to compete with.

Initially I was so tired and couldn't focus at work at all, i even felt more depressed.  After a week of starting (50mg) I felt like I was becoming less tired and groggy,  but with each increase the process repeated.  I've been on 200mg for around 2 weeks now and I feel much less sedated.  I think everyones different but I'm glad i stuck it out.

Everybody feels the way you do when they start taking seroquel, it will last about 2-5 months. But you'll get used to it, and eventually it will be hard to imagine life without it.

BipolarReddit,3e0iyj,cpmpal,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:48 2015 UTC,"I've tried benadryl, the hydroxyzine one, melatonin...nope. Ambien works (or it used to work great), and we've tried to use traz as a sleep aid. If I take more than a pill, I sleep hard, and wake up as smart as a rock. Seriously, I haz the stupids for a few hours.   So, I'm alternating traz and ambien for sleeping, half or quarter pill each to prevent becoming resistant to it. I really can't take more than a whole pill, and cannot do half pills every night, I get the stupids.   It is so so hard to fall asleep naturally anymore. Even when I do, it's only a 3 hour sleep, then I can't fall asleep again."
BipolarReddit,3e0iyj,cabothief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:59:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear. The antihistamine are pretty much the only non-zonking sleep aid I've ever seen.  The one nice thing at least at the trazadone is your body doesn't become exactly hard addicted to it like it can with ambien.  Still that's rough way to get some needed sleep. If I could, I would physically give you my tireds"

BipolarReddit,3e0iyj,mathwizard420,3,Tue Jul 21 07:07:11 2015 UTC,"Well! That's terrifying.  Did you have an alarm? I mean if a pill's going to make you sleep the clock around, it totally might make you ignore an alarm, but just wondering.  One time I took a nap without setting an alarm. I wasn't even really tired, but my dog was willing to cuddle. Fell asleep at 4PM, woke up at 6. Got up to make dinner and had a small argument with my dad about whether it was 6AM or 6PM. He won. I accidentally took a 14-hour nap. Lucky for me this was during summer vacation, so I didn't screw myself over, but it was the most disoriented I'd ever felt."

I'll wake up feeling refreshed but the mind working for like 20hrs a day nonstop gets tiring.  Doc gave me trazadone. I tried it a couple of times and would wake up about an hour and a half if I took it. Last time I took it I woke up sprawled out on a floor with a bad rugburn on my entire arm which did not make sense and pissed me off so I stopped taking it entirely.
BipolarReddit,3e116n,cuddlytrex,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"8 family members for 10 days. Are they all staying with you? I think this would drive anyone to the brink of despair.   It's going to be tough, however you look at it. My advice is try to get away from them as much as possible. One way would be to go running (if you don't actually run not to worry just say you have taken it up. Then sit in a park/window shop for 90mins or whatever, and sprint the last km home so it looks like your sweaty). I'm sure you can think up other creative ways. Maybe get a friend to do an emergency call for you when/if you need a fast exit.   It's good your seeing your therapist next Tuesday, maybe they will have some good advice. If your moods are still rough maybe ask the therapist for a short-term increase in the seroquel until your family leaves."
BipolarReddit,3e116n,highvoltage1,3,Tue Jul 21 11:57:14 2015 UTC,"It's your house. It's your time. It's your mental health.  You have a few options. If you, for your own well-being, need to avoid anything out of the ordinary, then lean on your father and sister for support as you go through hell. See if they can help you keep a handle on things. Get away as often as you can (I liked /u/highvoltage1's ideas)  If you need to avoid conflict, and get away from it all, rent a motel room for the week. Let them stay in your house, but don't let them hold you prisoner there.  If you can handle a little stress, and you want to fix this problem, then you need to set boundaries. If your father and sister better understand what you're going through, lean on them to help you enforce those boundaries. If your aunt can't control her monster kids despite you expressing your need for her to do so, have her find someplace else to stay. If people start giving you shit about this, and do not listen to your needs, have them stay somewhere else. You own your life, and as important as family may be, you don't have to suffer for their convenience. Give them the opportunity to respect your needs, and if they don't, force them to do so by getting them the fuck away from you. They cannot expect you to satisfy their wants while they refuse to even acknowledge your needs, and you need to (at some point, even if it isn't right now) be the one to enforce that. If they fuck this week up for you, and want you to do anything like this again, tell them they can find a hotel or they can not come - that's the only choice they have."

Feel lucky you didn't or don't experience akathasia … it sucks. Thankfully there are meds for that.  The price is a legit concern. I'm on state insurance so it's free but if/when I get a job I'll never be able to afford it. That's a huge concern.  Glad to hear you're doing well.

It's nice to hear a good story about it."
BipolarReddit,3dygg5,Elle_se_sent_seul,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:04 2015 UTC,"My only physical issue with Latuda was how tired it made me, Taking it at night with dinner, I would still end up sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day, and be groggy when I was awake, I hadn't even noticed how bad it was until my pdoc moved me to lamictal due to odd weight gain. Emotionally it really helped, but not being able to stay awake for more than five hours kinda sucked. Also, I had a 47$ co pay for a months subscription, if I hadn't had insurance, my dose was going to cost 800$ a month."
BipolarReddit,3dzohp,Tdub327,4,Mon Jul 20 20:53:55 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a super basic one, but get in therapy. Just talking about things weekly/however often you need it is so underrated and can calm you down so much. Also, they can teach you techniques to work through when you're having an episode.  Also talk to your doctor about switching medicines, adding more. That many violent swings isn't normal and there are meds that can regulate those!  Aside from that, exercise. I do yoga once a week and run when I can, and it helps too. Good luck! It will get better."

BipolarReddit,3dzohp,highvoltage1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"work with your therapist to develop communication tools to at least safely and confidently communicate an upcoming shift. Also work with your therapist to be receptive during episodes for a stop everything phrase your family can use.  When I'm incredibly manic, my husband knows the signs and I own up to my responsibilities to my husband to maintain a safe environment by telling him, I am having trouble and I am manic. First thing after I say I am having trouble is my husband grabs a pen and paper he will ask what needs to be done. This allows me to rant (while being still no grabbing items and no yelling, you have a responsibility to manage your outbursts as they are happening, get the help needed to make that so). He will write down everything and if I'm bad he will ask if it would help if I took my emergency meds. He will take on many of the to do items as well as break down the most important and point me in a direction to complete the small parts needed to complete the list.  When I am depressed I have a hard time eating. My husband ensures there is applesauce and cubes of cheese in the refrigerator. I will own up to it and say I am having a hard day and feeling really low. He will ask when was the last time I ate? I have a responsibility to my health and causing as little concern from my family so I am honest. It is hard to start being utterly transparent and honest but it is the best thing that ever happened for my family and has allowed my friends and family to help when my swings have impacted my life to the point I can't reign them in alone.  Your meds should be managing the severe ends of swings that create unsafe and fearful situations around those you love. You need to see your doc and be completely honest about it. My husband accompanies me to mine now so he can share issues my disease has created from his eyes. I'm not always aware of the subtle things happening, having an outside set of eyes I can trust helps."
BipolarReddit,3dzohp,oceanicmarauder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:02 2015 UTC,Have you talked to your therapist about this issue? If you can't stop it maybe your meds need some adjustment.

It helps me better judge where I currently am and where I have been. Sometimes, for example, I won't notice if I'm in a mixed state or hypomanic until I've been in the state for a little while, even with the record keeping. I also keep an open conversation with my partner about my mood."

He's been on it for years and gets noticeable withdrawal symptoms whenever the dose goes down, but the new pdoc wants to taper off the Klonopin now. What we did is ask for a prescription for a compounding pharmacy (google that plus your town to find one) to make some pills that instead of his usual dose of 0.5 are only 0.45. That is a small enough dose drop that he's only noticed a slight restlessness - then we'll go to 0.4 mg and continue in very small increments with several weeks for each. I highly recommend the website for all kinds of help, though - especially the nutritional info. Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,3dzh52,gingerwabisabi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:18 2015 UTC,Thank you I will def check that out. I need a doctor willing to work SLOWLY with me in getting off of klonopin.
BipolarReddit,3dzh52,kaliena,0,Tue Jul 21 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"Hi!  bp1 panic, GAD. I'm here to help! I take it and Xanax PRN.  Neurontin aka Gabapentin is used off label for anxiety. GABA is vital for staying asleep and also helps some anxiety patients.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12662130  So, gabapentin failed in clinical trials. This doesn't mean it doesn't work, it just doesn't work reliably enough across enough populations. So let's guesstimate that 20% of people in trial saw some improvement. That wasn't enough for the FDA to put it on the label. It's more of a side effect than a reliable effect.  It's normal for a doctor to still try a drug for the purpose off label. At that point you are being put on shit for the hope of getting side effects.   I take 1200mg of Gabapentin. You can take a shit ton more for seizure prevention.  It's fine to try 900mg or 1200mg of it.  There is a similar drug that is on label for anxiety. You can ask your doc about Pregabalin.   Regarding Xanax and benzodiazepines in general. Look. Anxiety sucks psyhilitic donkey ass. Panic too.  But benzos are a band aid on a gut wound. If you use them more than once a week you are using them to mask your suffering and survive but you aren't making progress.  Therapy helps. CBT, DBT, Mindful Meditation. You want to reduce instances, you need this shit. Anxiety is a habit of thinking and reacting and you CAN train yourself to reduce it.  You want a medicine to reduce instances? Antidepressants are useful for that.   What do benzos do? They make you feel better temporarily and then you need them again the next time you trigger. And if you use them constantly your brain gets lazy and you actually feel awful if you skip doses like any ADDICT and you bet that feeds your disorder.  Benzos are the emergency inhalers of the brain. They are meant to rescue you. They are not meant for every day treatment. Just like asthmatics use 2 different inhalers, you need a daily one, and a rescue one. Don't use the rescue as a daily. It's bad for you.   To withdraw,  let's assume you take one pill a day.  Start by taking your current pills and if they are not Extended Release, cut them in halls, then quarters. Take 3/4s a pill on your normal dose for 2 weeks. This is such a tiny bump you won't notice it. Then go to 1/2 a pill for 2 weeks. Then go to 1/4 of a pill for 2 weeks. Then look up and see if you can get a pill for 1/2 of that. For example, if you tritate down to .5mg, get .25mg and keep going.  Yeah, I'm saying take a few weeks, even two months, to do it. But this way you aren't throwing your body into a shock. Alternatively check into inpatient and let them handle your detox.  They have fun counter-agent drugs for the withdrawal.  I used to take Xanax way, way, way too much,  It did NOT resolve my anxiety issues. In the end, I was dependent on it for a time, in that skipping it made me feel ill.  I did detox off it.  When I did that, I was able to finally do the work in therapy and get PREVENTITVE drugs. This is so much better for my quality of life than slapping a benzo band aid on every day.   You can absolutely do this. Feel free to PM if you like."

I tried already, i suffered for MONTHS not a week or so. MONTHS. I went down from 0.5 2x day to 0.5 and 0.25. My body is different than yours, your body is different than mine.

BipolarReddit,3dyjfg,fdorbh,6,Mon Jul 20 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"don't say I'm manic, because I'm on meds   Medication doesn't guarantee that you won't have manic episodes or depressive ones. That's not how it works (unless you found a magic pill?). You sound like you're definitely experiencing paranoia, which most likely is unfounded. If you've gotten to the point where you're putting things over your windows, you really need to contact your psychiatrist ASAP.  Are you 17-25? This is the age where schizoaffective disorders appear and one of the telltale signs is seeing things or people, making connections that don't exist. You should immediately seek medical attention."

If I take the last of my meds or notice I have only 3 left, at my nightstand I pull out my phone and use the walgreens app and refill my meds for the store that is on my way to and from work, so I have multiple chances to remember."
BipolarReddit,3dxeg1,becabecaful,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yup. Sometimes I forgot and fell out of habit, sometimes I consciously chose not to. Eventually always start again but compliance has never been my strong point."
BipolarReddit,3dxeg1,discomposed,2,Mon Jul 20 11:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I go too far down, believe I'm not in fact suffering a mental illness, and stop taking the medication I obviously don't need because I'm just a shit individual that should kill themselves.  I go even just slightly up, know I am in fact suffering from Bipolar Disorder, and I want my fun times because I should really never be trusted in even the mildest of hypomanic states. When you're depressed most of the time even with the medication and that elation hits all logic goes out the window.  The medication you're prescribed causes a side effect that doesn't result in instant death but does guarantee you're going to need to spend thousands on preventing that side effect from leaving you toothless later on? Nope a million times nope.  Would I love love love to be one of those med-compliant patients my doctor can be all proud of? Of course. Have I been able to be that patient yet? Nope, just a lot of guilt and shame for being such a nightmare for my nice doctor to deal with... but it seems not enough for me to put my big girl panties on and make responsible adult choices when I'm episodic."
BipolarReddit,3dxeg1,Necessarythrowaway3,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"I was the world's worst about taking my meds,  but since I've found a combination that works for me,  I take them regularly.

It's part and parcel, unfortunately, of our condition and you'll have to simply be strong and know that your deep, and sometimes seemingly endless, sense of empathy is proof enough that you have much to offer the world, and that you can be happy and find a peace of mind if you stay the course.  Feeling this way is taxing enough, but having to despise myself so deeply for feeling what is an awful way to exist is the cherry on top of a fuck you ice cream sundae. Give yourself a break, keep talking to the ones you love about ow you feel, keep being aware of how you're feeling, and keep on taking your meds and continuing your treatment.

I'm have bipolar (I refuse to say ""I am bipolar""), and would never ever NEVER give my children my pills.

I know it fucked me up hard for a good long time.  But if you are that scared, get ER help if it is that bad.    Lastly, and here's what's going to get me downvoted into oblivion.  I'm a firm believer in ghosts. I'm going on 40 now, and still remember things from my childhood.   I'm the only 'crazy' one in my family, yet many members of my family (extended family as well) have seen ghosts in my mothers house.  Aunts and uncles refuse to stay there overnight for over 30 years now because of the ghosts.

So taking him there is the best thing to do at this point, and am glad to hear you have an appointment soon.   Your son doesn't have to ""BE this way"", the earlier the intervention the better the outcomes. He can live a fully normal life. Be his advocate, be his parent, but don't be his doctor (for everyone's sake since it's illegal). Give him support, show him the world of possibilities out there for him, and make sure communication is always open between the two of you so you can help him be on top of his medical regimen if he ends up with one. It will be hard. You shouldn't feel guilt but you will, and it's just a phase like mourning. You might feel a lot of feelings about it, just make sure that you also stay on top of your own health."

BipolarReddit,3dtdqp,highvoltage1,2,Sun Jul 19 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"The ghosts he's seeing sound like a hallucination a friend of mine talked about, he called them the shadow people. Dark figures moving around. He got them when he hadn't slept in a long time (apparently he had a phase with meth). Apparently this is one of the more common types of visual hallucinations.  Sleep is essential, and I've read that sleep deprivation can lead to psychosis (please don't make me find a source, I'm not claiming it as fact), so helping him get sleep is critical. Personally, I'd try chamomile tea and melatonin well before benzos.  That shit is scary. And it feeling normal is almost as scary. I don't want to say take him to a psych ward, even though it would quite likely benefit his symptoms, because for me that was often worse than the hallucinations. Hopefully kids' wards are better.  Think about this: before you take fault for your son's biology and response to his environment, think about all the good you've experienced in your life and the opportunities you'll be able to give him to do the same and so much more. And how much better prepared he'll be to handle it with you having already been there.  Honestly, while hallucinating has been one of the top three most painful experiences of my life (it kind of feels like a three way tie right now), I learned some incredibly valuable lessons from it. It is painful, but it is also the kind of pain that can make you stronger."

It could take me half an hour of showering that could take five because of the fear. This created bullying in school because I didn't shower as often as I should. This persisted all the way up to when I was 20 to some degree. I moved away from home at 17 and had to shower with my SO to be able to. At 22 when I lived at home for a bit I took my first shower in the shower that haunted me without fear, it was amazing.  Flushing the toilet was also really loud and if I managed to I literally ran out of the bathroom. My dad accepted that I didn't flush during the night since his room is nearby and I didn't want to wake him. Sometimes I even went to be school after hours to use theirs or peed in the garden. They didn't like noise. I couldn't play music loudly, vacuuming was terrifying because it was loud and I saw things moving in the shadows when I tried to sleep.  Upside I've gotten better though. There aren't any they anymore and I feel free. I still don't have any answers about why this happened, but it just was. I won. I think you and your son can win too!"

Mine lasted from the age of 12 to the age of 19. Then I had ECT and I had a month and a half of relief, but living with my family like I am right now is just bringing it all back.   Are you seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist? It's important to have both; I think part of why I'm sliding back is because I don't have a therapist."

BipolarReddit,3dsony,AestheteBrah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:39:36 2015 UTC,"Well its actual mood stabilising mechanism is still not understood but at its core lithium is still just a salt. People in backwards times used to put it on food and so on. Once you get the right dosage - If you don't have the rare but serious complications with your thyroid or otherwise - it's just a steady dose of salt in your body, making you a bit thirstier, but that's it. Its the most observed/studied drug in this area.  In short, with basically all other drugs in this area, you are guaranteed some side effects and there is more uncertainty. Having said that, it's not as scary or as permanent as lithium can be"
BipolarReddit,3dsony,garymavis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:10 2015 UTC,Do you know if Lithium Ororate is something that can provide a source of lithium to treat bipolar disorder? Or does it have to be some other type of lithium salt that is only sold via prescription?  Thanks!
BipolarReddit,3dsony,ssnakeggirl,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing about lithium. It's dangerous. The amount that helps you is close to the amount that will kill you. Lithium Ororate doesn't come close to supplying enough lithium, and if it did, it would be very dangerous. Lithium is only safe when you are getting regular blood work to monitor your blood level."

Miraculous drug.  The side-effects are easily monitored because we know what to expect.   Anti-psychotics are poorly researched with a strong bias and you can not monitor or predict the side effects as well. One day you might develop diabetes or a spontaneous permanent Parkinsonian like movement disorder. Maybe heart problems. Massive weight gain. They were not made for bipolars. Not saying not to take them but in my opinion they are more dangerous than Lithium.   I always think Lithium should be the first drug bipolars try. As it is cheap. It didn't work for me sadly."
BipolarReddit,3dsony,garymavis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"completely kill suicidal ideation (only med proven to do so)   Wow. I did not know this. I have constant suicidal ideation in times of stress. I have not yet been diagnosed but I do for sure have extreme social anxiety and feel that I may have bipolar disorder and some type of Tourrette's like OCD (I have some behavioral tics in times of stress). I know the suicidal ideation is largely a part of my anxiety and OCD symptoms.  From what you and others have been saying, it seems like if lithium isn't a miracle drug, it's a super dangerous drug. I will look into lithium, but am wary due to the dangers (diabetes, Parkinsons, heart problem that you mentioned). Another commenter said the dose you need is close to the dose that might kill you and that your blood needs to be monitored constantly.   Very high maintenance..."
BipolarReddit,3dsony,RallyK,2,Mon Jul 20 12:04:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry you misunderstood. In my opinion anti-psychotics are more dangerous. Parkinsonian like symptoms, diabetes etc. those are anti-psychotic side effects not Lithium ones.  Lithium is very reliable and very safe because you know what to look out for. That is not the case with anti-psychotics as they cause spontaneous side-effects dependent on the individual."

But besides that, hypo is a blast and I wish that I could experience it without a subsequent crash, but there's just about always a crash. As long as I keep that in mind while I'm rolling, it isn't heartbreaking like it used to be. Before, when I would go hypomanic, I would convince myself that this time I was finally better, finally just a regular, non bipolar person. Of course that's foolish, and when I would crash I would just be so disappointed that I have to keep dealing with this. But now it's just another part of my life, and that's okay."

BipolarReddit,3draww,NachoLlama,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:27 2015 UTC,Well said. I think I need to be reminded of this from time to time.
BipolarReddit,3draww,AtemporalVellichoria,3,Sun Jul 19 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"I was like this for a few years in the earliest part of the decade--2009, 2010, and most of 2011.  Most of my mid-to-late teen years were like this, actually, which is apparently atypical for cyclothymic/BP II types like me (from what I've heard it's usually it's the other way around, with people primarily presenting as depressive rather than hypomanic early on).  It was like just being extra high-functioning--it was nice, definitely, and parts of it were awesome.  I felt like I was able to transition fairly fluidly between endeavors and hold many elaborate threads of thought in my head simultaneously--which for me at the time meant that I could write soap opera fanfiction, sciencey and sci-fi poetry, think about music, and do calculus problems all in the space of a couple of hours, which seems almost unimaginable today.  Academically I was on the top of my game, I was socializing at a superficial level with a lot of people I usually/otherwise wouldn't, had a ton of energy and was both highly analytical and creative, with a thirst for life and reasonable balance of hobbies and schoolwork.  I guess it wasn't technically all the time, as I was starting to manifest cyclothymic tendencies and had little bursts of dysthymic depression which, while concerning, passed fairly quickly and didn't impact my functioning all that much.  I'm not trying to rain on your parade, but from what I learned in my experience, the downsides of being mildly hypo all the time (as opposed to just happy/normal/euthymic) were slightly but constantly elevated levels of irritability--I could be snippy, impatient with people and aggressive if anyone or anything got in my way--and some little byproducts of the grandiosity of self-image/heightened self-esteem, like not being nearly introspective and self-critical enough.  I knew little about myself because I was extended outward so much, which was rather unfortunate as there were a lot of personal issues there I needed to examine.  At the same time, though, embarrassingly to me now, I thought I had myself all figured out and considered myself more self-aware than almost anyone.  I really was pretty tone-deaf to the emotional landscape of others a lot of the time.  I also produced a lot of utterly crap work/creative output in addition to great, quality stuff simply because in my inflated self-image I couldn't tell the difference!  Also there were quite a few nights when I didn't get anything done that I needed to because I was up all night binge-reading or watching something, researching and learning everything that I could about random subjects of interest, or masturbating, and that negatively impacted my sleep (though I had a diminished need for it) as well as my grades and such.    In conclusion, OP, there are people like this, who are at the upper edge of 'normal' or a little beyond--think most 'eccentrics', overachievers, 'people person' types and precocious folks--and while it is nice for them, they can come off a little unfocused, self-important/pretentious and entitled to those around them at times. (In psychiatric parlance, most would probably be classified under the 'cyclothymia' banner.) I dunno.  I do often yearn for those days when the world was my oyster and despair hit me only occasionally--they're definitely preferable in most ways to the emotionally reversed world I experience now, but I'd really rather just be like I was when I was little, euthymic/happy and with an even baseline.  That has most of the upsides of hypomania (maybe a little bit less so, of course) without the grandiosity, irritability and lack of focus many experience and also without inevitable jolts of depression.  Maybe I'm responding too in-depth or seriously to a whimsical post, but that's my take on things.  Take it for what it's worth."

I could probably do some of the things I wanted to do if I had the room to do it but its not really possible either if that makes sense.  Like I'd be a badass president, but the course of getting there would be so tedious and time consuming I'd get fed up with it before the fact.  Also it makes it hard to live in society. You're capable of doing things other people can't. Sometimes you forget that. Can get yourself into trouble because as a whole other element you're expected to follow the norm. Whether its through behavior, physical capability, or rule of law.  Also your body is a little more resilient, a little more enduring, a little stronger but it wears down. Inevitably you'll suffer from joint or tendon damage. Kind of like car tires. So its good even then to find a way to mediate oneself.  I work on a ship and when I'm away. Or even in different countries I feel empowered and accepted but in the states where I'm from especially I feel like a criminal that hasn't done anything yet or like I'm constantly being observed and people are either curious as to why I'm acting like a nut or scared that I am one.  Which sometimes is probably the case.  I'm not necessarily paranoid or anything but when you tend to do shit spontaniously out of the norm it calls attention to the self which can be good or bad.  I've been accused of being on drugs when I was sober several times or of being completely insane.   Watch that charlie sheen video and its the kind of conversation you'd have with a permanent hypo.

You may not be able to destroy the voices outright through medication, but medication more often than not at least makes the voices less threatening.  There are lots of medications to try! And there are also medications which can make you use substances less or not at all. When it comes down to it, though, you need to be the one who says ""No!"" in the face of recreational substances. It's about how far you'll go to be well and defeat the disease in your brain.  I'm curious as to what you were/are self-medicating with.  It sounds like you're under a lot of stress and want relief.

You also have to be aware of one's own self absorption when in frequent states of misery. It's a lot to handle for others (so give them a break) and it sometimes people often feel repelled rather just trying to abandon. It's tough and life with me for my younger brother was not easy.

You can make his vacation awesome by just going to the park and having a fun time. He won't be thinking about what he's missing out on because he is focused on the fun he is having at the time. That's the great thing about kids, they don't worry about that stuff. So just give him a fun time because that's all he needs.  You can work towards getting a better career and it may take a few years of classes but you can work toward a degree. It's hard working a job, taking classes, and taking care of a family but you can do it. It all depends on what you're interested in to find out what kind of degree/classes are offered that are available to you."

I'm not sure that being in software QA is completely terrible (though I've heard rough things about the video games industry). I could be wrong, but I think ""video games tester"" is less of a teenager job and more of a ""what they think they want to do when they grow up"" job. Can you see any space for learning to code and segueing into a gig with your current company doing something a little less tedious for a little more money? My first tech job was technically support but because I was working for a startup and knew some code they basically used me as a junior developer. Not the same I know.  EDIT: I realized after I walked away that you are probably a woman and that the video games industry might be sexist. :( So ymmv with the ""just learn programming"" advice."
BipolarReddit,3dp13b,A_Walled_Garden,3,Sat Jul 18 02:07:20 2015 UTC,"Lithium or valproic acid work well to control mania/hypomania and stabilise mood. So valproic acid is something else to consider if you haven't tried it. It's been around for awhile too.   Actual amounts of lithium is meaningless and blood levels are important. I'm running a blood level of 1.0-1.1 (I do this because I prefer the extra protection and don't suffer too many side effects). Blood levels reliably indicate if lithium is in the therapeutic range and is effective.  To stress my point, to achieve my blood level I take 1350mg a day. 1350mg for someone else will mean a different blood level which may mean the drug is not therapeutic.  Sorry to stress this point but a lot of people talk about dose in mg for lithium but it's essentially meaningless.   In terms of actually taking lithium I really like it. It does take some time for side effects to subside (for me it was over a year - the pdoc really pushed me to stick to it). It controls mania really well (but allows me to experience natural uplifts in mood), works wellish on the lows. Cheap and blood tests are free where I am.   The downsides? If you play competitive sport you can forget that. Under physical pressure and intense exertion lithium robs most people  of co-ordination and that 'top end'. Social sport is fine. Depending on levels mental dullness can occur. For a lot of people this will fade in time. It took me around a year for this to occur. I hated that for a long time but now I think sticking with lithium is totally worth it.  This article also has some cool facts about lithium. I find it so cool that I'm taking an element that makes me well that was only emitted as part of the big bang."

I actually can relate to some of her manic delusions, which is kind of a relief.  I was diagnosed BP type 2 (I generally suffer from hypomania, rather than full-blown mania, as far as I know) and I'm afraid of thyroid/organ damage, so I've been hoping a low dose, or as you explained, a lower blood level, might be effective for me.    I'm running a blood level of 1.0-1.1 (I do this because I prefer the extra protection and don't suffer too many side effects).   Is that level on the higher end?"
BipolarReddit,3dp13b,highvoltage1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:11 2015 UTC,yes. Higher levels than this and I get sick. But higher levels reduces the risk of another episode (manic or depressed) A lot of people run 0.8. Some run lower. I guess on what level is appropriate depends on your doctor and you. I know the US and Australia do have differences in guidelines in lithium administration so I can't give too much relevant advice.

Most often I see people with thyroid dysfunction or failure because of it. It also has numerous physical side effects such as hydration problems and tremors.

Here's my understanding of it (definitely do your own research and talk to your doctor): apparently hormonal birth control can cause lamotrigine to be processed and leave the body quicker, effectively lowering your dose, possibly by as much as half. There's also some evidence to suggest lamotrigine can lower the effectiveness of birth control. From what I've read there haven't been enough studies on the interactions for the medical community to fully understand it, but my GP was not comfortable prescribing me lamotrigine and birth control together, she was concerned the amount of lamotrigine in my body would spike during the pill-free week."

Lithium has really brought the highs of my mania way down to a normally functioning place.  Nothing else has ever quite done that for me.  It doesn't render me without any symptoms or Bipolar or make me a normal person, but it has made my life much more manageable and ultimately enjoyable.  It has it's side effects, and I wonder if my days on Lithium are numbered because of it's effect on the kidneys.

BipolarReddit,3dop0w,shillyshally,3,Sat Jul 18 00:20:07 2015 UTC,I think in every bipolars mind there is this desperation to be validated. When we are not accepted at our word by those we love we feel the solution is a simple one: present objective scientific evidence.   But in my experience it doesn't work. Your father isn't interested in being convinced he's wrong anymore than an anti-vaxxer or a creationist. They come up with their view-point and then filter proof so that it aligns with their mindset. It's not that they look at evidence in the first place to come to the conclusion. It's that they come to the conclusion and then seek evidence that further confirms their belief.  Your father is not immune to this and you will sour the relationship further by trying to force empathy from a man who doesn't want to give it to you in this particular area. Empathy is given or it isn't. It doesn't need to be fought for or earned. And while there are few times a person drastically changes their mindset it's....well like expecting to win the lottery and getting angry when it doesn't happen.  You will have to learn to be ok with people thinking you're a lazy loser who makes excuses. I'm better for it and I have found acceptance and validation from other people besides my father. My fathers acceptance was always conditional and I see that now. I didn't then but I do now.   My father suffers from psychosis and he doesn't think bipolar is real.

I don't know what else to say - it sucks. You have to grieve the loss of the person you thought you knew and adjust to the new reality.  EDIT - for what its worth, my dad didn't think it existed either. I think hes sort of come around after seeing meds help me, but his initial reactions were very very negative. Now hes kind of like ""well if the doctor says so... shrug."""

Everyone likes to be validated, unfortunately it doesn't always happen and this can be hurtful. You can try your best to educate your dad. Perhaps if he is willing, take him to a counselling session. I did once and it gave us an opportunity to communicate with a professional in the room to help mediate / educate. When my councellor told my dad about my bipolar .. My dad said ""... But I thought my daughter was smart?"" As if I couldnt have bipolar and be smart. I have came to the realization that my father won't understand. We don't discuss it and I don't rely on him to validate or comfort me. My father does not disrespect me though. It is important to perhaps distance yourself and be assertive with your father, in order to take care of yourself and your feelings if it becomes hurtful. Also, I have learned to be patient with people who are still trying to figure out my diagnosis and it entails. Bipolar is hard to understand."

BipolarReddit,3dmw2n,jennocyde,7,Fri Jul 17 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"This is the number one problem when trying to treat your husband. Drugs are bad, but they are fucking bad when paired with bipolar. Weed might seem like a mild and harmless substance, but it can cause psychosis in people prone to it, and more importantly in this case, full blown mania or even rapid cycling.  Docs have enough problems with the medication balance already, ANYTHING which affects it worsens the quality of the treatment. Some can't even tolerate caffeine, me being one of those.  Edit: also, as TheFucksOfMe above said, you have the full moral permission (and even requirement when a child is involved) to get out of the situation until he stabilizes. Mental disorders can wreck relationships if it gets to intolerable levels.  Edit 2: same goes for anything else ""natural"" such as all kinds of herbs. They are not regulated and can contain different doses of the herb. And some of them have nasty side-effects with psych meds. Clear everything through a doctor first before he can take it."

BipolarReddit,3dmw2n,HemingwaysBush,5,Fri Jul 17 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"exactly, and it does increase the paranoia, psychosis and anxiety sometimes for people."
BipolarReddit,3dmw2n,scurius,7,Fri Jul 17 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"Weed is sort of a mixed bag for bipolars in my minority opinion. In my minority opinion it can do some wonderful things:   Predispose you to sleeping when you're a manic insomniac Combat anxiety Make you more receptive to (some of) your partner's desires Combat depression (when not used often. after awhile it becomes easy to slip into dependence where you're anxious and unhappy whenever you're not high) Make you nicer to the people around you   But it can do some very bad things for us:   It has been known to induce mania (sometimes while you're high, sometimes after a day or so) It can make people depressed. The study I recall reading found that for some bipolars it would push towards depression and for others it would push towards mania It can make you really fucking paranoid and anxious It can make men grow boobs and have problems getting it up It can make even normal people psychotic (hallucinate or believe false things), which is especially painful.   I'm gonna take a moment to discuss the nature of psychosis because it deserves special attention. You can believe painful and paranoid things, and that the people closest to you are working to hurt you, and things that will lead you to serious danger. Additionally, as was the unfortunate case for me, it can be shared to other people, especially in suggestible states (like childhood). For me, I was hypnotized while I was high by someone who was already psychotic, but we were both hallucinating. I believe we were both bipolar. The most excruciating moments in my life can all be traced back to psychosis. My girlfriend of four years leaving me? Partially attributable to psychosis. Undergoing ECT? Because of a suicide attempt attributable to psychosis. Believing the people I loved most had hurt me and were trying to make me subhuman? Because of psychosis.  All in all, I'm pushing for legalization because I believe it can help the mentally ill including bipolars. But I'm not a doctor, I'm only partially informed, and there are still drawbacks. It should not replace currently prescribed meds, especially as it stands now.  Street weed tends to be much higher in THC than CBD, and CBD is believed to (possibly) have antipsychotic properties which would be therapeutic for us. I am under the understanding that THC can significantly contribute to psychosis. So yeah, street weed can be pretty bad for us.  Legalization would mean more appropriate strains (like high CBD bud) could be available to us, and things might be safer. I'm also under the impression that many of us are going to smoke whether it's legal or not, so it's better to have the option of getting safer stuff.  If he's going to continue smoking weed, which he probably shouldn't in any high quantities or regular frequencies, he takes on a significant risk of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications (many of which have disagreeable side effects) reduce the risk (I believe, but can't prove this seeing as I haven't seen a study talking about its role preventing cannabis-induced psychosis (which is actually listed as a disorder in the psychiatric diagnosis handbook)).  So weed can do some good, but it can also do seriously dangerous bad that is not limited to him.  If he had a DUI and is smoking a lot of weed, he may be self medicating. Hopefully the right drugs, provided he takes them (he would benefit from your reinforcing that he should), could reduce the reasons for him to.  I'm so sorry you're in this situation. It must suck monkey nads. You may find the folks over at /r/bipolarSOs have some good advice to contribute regarding your relationship too.  But the right medicine is more important than weed, and weed can interfere with it. This doesn't mean he'll definitely be hurt if he smokes, since I've gotten fairly high (while on therapeutic doses of the antipsychotic med latuda) a couple times in the last year without my significant psychosis coming back at all, but it means it can easily interfere with his meds.  The most important aspect of my relationship with my psychiatrist has been our dialogue about the role of alcohol in my life. She advocates near zero amounts, citing how unrealistic it would be for her to ask me to have none, and I limit my drinking somewhat. She doesn't fault me when I self medicate with alcohol, but succeeds at making me remember how miserable it can make me.  TL;DR: weed and alcohol may have some ability to improve your husband's quality of life, and I believe it would be unrealistic to expect him to give up both altogether (especially suddenly), but they both can easily significantly interfere with treatment in quite a bad way  Edit: I'm primarily referring to this study.  Heads up, some of the following links are to PDFs found through google scholar. Sauces and all that jazz.  I'm less certain which specific studies I found (months ago) referring to CBD as an antipsychotic, and I think it's commonly enough accepted fact that cannabis use absolutely does correlate with psychosis (causation requires more rigorous standards than I'm prepared to find sources for, but probably that too). Relevant studies can be found here, and here; this one cites THC as eliciting psychosis in its abstract (and CBD possibly combatting it), and I know research hasn't definitively proven CBD to be an antipsychotic (research is limited in the current legal environment), but here are some sources on CBD as an antipsychotic:  http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=s0100-879x2006000400001&script=sci_arttext  http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Guimaraes2/publication/227707576_A_critical_review_of_the_antipsychotic_effects_of_cannabidiol_30_years_of_a_translational_investigation/links/543d11510cf20af5cfbfa362.pdf  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584612002801  (that last one argues it doesn't function as one, just based on the title; furthering my point that people aren't certain it is)  I think this reinforces my point that people have speculated CBD might be an antipsychotic, and that it may have the capacity to weaken the detrimental effects of THC, which was primarily what I was getting at. Sorry if the sources don't fully back up my points, but they're a starting point for research, it's approaching 1am, and I've been drinking.  2nd edit: some of the subjective effects I'm taking from personal experience, and I can find sources to prove pot makes you calm, happy, and sleepy (the first two translating into a nicer person), but I figured that was covered under ""common knowledge""  On further review I realize I don't have sources for ED and gynecomastia (man boobs), but ED also fits with common knowledge. Here is a google scholar search where the first result, which I can't access, references the effect. I link the search because later links may be helpful to readers, and the first might also be accessible to them."

Until he makes his mental health stability a priority, you sticking around and accepting his outbursts will do little to encourage this priority. There is a way to be supportive during the treatment, but he needs to be seriously focused on getting himself in a great place to be a successful husband and father. Anything short of that priority is unacceptable.  The weed thing, knock that crap off unless it is prescribed by the doctor. Weed and antidepressants have known complications that can make depression and suicide more difficult to deal with. Stick to what the doc recommends, realize that meds are not and instant fix they can take a year to tweak to the right med and concentration, and learn methods to reign in his moods. Meds are not enough alone, there has to be an ownership of one's swings and a responsibility to manage life to avoid serious consequences. I for one will alert my husband what swings are happening, what I need to accomplish today, and how he can help. I am 10 years into treating my Bipolar issues and the disease takes time to understand within the patient and with the family and friends.

I know this feeling pretty well.  At this moment in time though, I'm massively depressed. Nothing feels worth getting out of bed for. I need to put together a presentation for next week and do a load of reading of academic papers, but my brain is just pure fog, and I have no motivation to do any of it. I have no idea whether or not I'm going to get any of it done.  I know I need to go to the doctor, but I just keep worrying over what to tell him. I'm pretty sure I've went through periods of hypomania, but it seems hard to tell if I was really just feeling like a normal person compared to how I feel right now, which is the lowest of the low. I feel like just going on a massive drug binge, but obviously that's not going to help with anything other than letting me get out of my head for a while."
BipolarReddit,3dmqr7,FarrenBlackwell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"If you've felt that way then that's the hypomania. A feeling of normalcy is a relative calmness. Like maybe before you go to sleep or just wake up before the energy kicks in.  I've gotten down pretty bad before. But its always been a condition of environment. When my ambition and drive can't overcome whats fucking me up and I feel totally helpless.  I sail for a living. Its what keeps me out of trouble and has helped me learn a lot and see the world.  When I found out I had the hypomania a Dr. gave me the mood stabilizers and anxiety meds to help me out. By requirement of the company I work for I had to show the prescription to a medic on board. He ended up having to consult a quack corporate dr. who had me taken out of work and put on a shit disability which was near minimum wage. For the money I make, as hard as I've worked and the standard of living that came with it I was forced to live in poverty for six months. I got into debt. Felt like a caged animal and used in order to keep me level because the pills weren't enough and I couldn't get anything that I actually needed because of my profession. My gf cheated on me, took her kids away and left who I had been raising as my own for over a year. Tried to get inside of my head and fought with me all the time and blamed me for not being able to work (she was lazy and didn't want to support herself).   I ended up getting in physical altercations with a lot of my family who tend to act like terrible people. Because I have a severe sense of justice and kept trying to set things right that maybe I shouldn't. At one point I ended up sleeping in my car in a parking lot.   My work was leaning towards letting me go because of all of this shit and I was absolutely helpless to do anything about it. I finally got to the point where I had a 9mm on the table contemplating emptying my own temple because I figured out that if I could not control myself. IF I couldn't take anything to help me do that. If I couldn't do what I felt I was born to do in order to keep me out of trouble and if I didn't have anyone close enough to me to help me out when I absolutely needed it then I was just gonna check the fuck out. My ex even suggested that I do it because she was such a miserable, evil person. And then when I tried to get the gun to my dad to keep in my car which I had to drive without a license or insurance because I was so broke, plus I had something in it I was taking that could have gotten me into trouble. I had an old lady state trooper come poke her head into my car to tell me what a nice car I had. Over the narcotics, over the gun, without the license and insurance. IF she wasn't a nice old lady I'd been in prison for years and years for just trying to save myself.  I'm not the depressive type. Even then it wasn't a ""woe is me"" thing. I was just tired of it and didn't see a way out. Frustrated and felt betrayed and victimized for no reason.  I ended up fighting it and getting through it though. Getting back to work. But I was still pretty bad off for awhile. Ended up using painkillers to help keep an even keel. I have a very high tolerance. I'd take about 4 lortab 10s just to keep me kind of sedated for a couple of hours and one night I just ended up snorting like five of them because I didn't give a shit and could feel my heartrate slow down and thought I wasn't going to wake up when I fell asleep. But I did.  The gist of it is that everyone gets to a shithole point even I did and I thought I was impenetrable to that sort of stuff. It just got way way too hard.  Talk to the dr. and don't worry about it. Be honest. The shit doesn't make you a freak it just makes you different. Once you get treated then you'll get better and back on track.  Play some music and maybe have some wine or some shit while you do your report but not if that sort of thing makes you worse.  I've ended up being in relationships with about three different women who had the same sort of shit.   Its really crappy because I'd come in and indirectly pull them out of it and then they'd just take off and walk away from me. So I've got a bit of experience being around people with that type of BPD.  Your head is going to tell you over and over and over that nothing will work and you're hopeless but you have to divert your attention and fight it until it passes and you get better. And even if it subsides for a bit don't let yourself not get treated because it'll inevitably come back.   I wish you luck with that shit. I know its hard."

I don't really get into any situations like that since I just lock myself up in my room. I've never had a relationship because no one knows I exist here in my little cave.  And yeah, I'm pretty sure it was hypomania that I've experienced before, it can just be hard to remember how it felt when you've been depressed for so long. Reading the symptoms on wikipedia though, I know for a fact that I was starting up loads of new projects, had racing thoughts and higher self-esteem, and bought quite a lot of expensive shit that I don't even use.  I was feeling so low earlier, but I took some tramadol before and it's actually given me quite a boost. It doesn't make me high, but since it's an SNRI it works quite well as an antidepressant for me (I take it for pain though). I'll have to bring it up with the doc since I think hypomania + SNRI = mania.  Music is a good shout, I've just been rocking out to Pink Floyd. I made a start on the presentation, though it is literally just a title slide right now, haha. Now I'm drafting up a letter to the GP.

Unfortunately, a few days after I began taking them I started going through mild benzo withdrawal (I've been trying to kick the drugs) and since then they've stopped giving me that previous boost I was getting.

I would also point out this (but don't take it as gospel) if you are not abusing your pain killers they won't likely take them off you. In fact sometimes they give you drugs that have a high potential for abuse. I, for example, was put on benzos when I was being treated for mania. As long as you are not abusing the painkillers you should be fine.   But your main concern should be your mental health, especially given the stress you are under doing a PhD.

I'm not surprised by this report, but it won't stop me from continuing to rely on my current psychiatrist for the quality care he's provided me. He has more education in the field of mental illness than I will ever have. You have to trust your mental health service professionals, or you simply won't stick with your treatment.

Pretty ex-beauty pageant girls make convincing claims when they bring you lunch.    Abilify is so amazing it needs to be the most prescribed drug in the US? And Seroquel/Zyprexa/Abilify need to control 75% of the anti-psychotic market?  Unfortunately the best we can do is....advocate for ourselves. Which is impossible when you're full blown manic or suicidal and need to be brought down to earth.

Boo, they should be ashamed.  Imagine if a similar paper came out about neurologists condoning concussions in sports because they get paid by the NFL? The only reason people aren't shocked by this paper is that we all secretly believe most of psychology is bullshit anyway, and we don't give a shit about the tortured, and the sick receiving poor treatment.

It was very, very hard to hold myself up against that standard and to say, ""you know, that really makes sense""... But it's done now and hopefully it was a first step on the road to recovery."

The first few chapters of the Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide has some good real life descriptions of bipolar moods.  For me, something that made things click was learning about irritable hypomania, agitated depression, and mixed states.  The whole idea that hypomania can feel bad was pretty mindblowing.  That ""are there ever periods where you feel a lot better than normal"" screening question isn't always helpful."

BipolarReddit,3dls1o,HemingwaysBush,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"I told my girlfriend and my parents found out. It didn't make it easier that the diagnosis came when I was inpatient. When I came back from being inpatient it was really hard to explain why I missed a semester without it, so I was honest. My friends saw my alcohol abuse and blatant self medication until then, so they knew something was wrong. They ended up being really damn supportive, and it seems like very little changed with them after telling them. But maybe they're just awesome people or hid their feelings?  And I intellectualize fucking everything. My therapist loves it. She just wishes I'd actually act on it. ""You always know what to do, but can never get yourself to do it."" My intellectualization of everything is what makes me stable so often. So it may not be such a bad thing.  Some of the meds for bipolar suck. Don't give up on medication just because the one you're on at the time sucks. There will be other meds, and one or more of them will work much better.  I want to have more thoughts, but I gtg. I plan to come back to this later. peace and good luck to you."

My mom was supportive and my dad, despite suffering from psychosis was not. Do NOT reveal this at your job. There are a few on here that it might have worked out for but in my opinion revealing this in your employment is like having a bunch of unprotected sex with strangers and expecting not to catch an STD.  Friends it depends what kinda friends you have."
BipolarReddit,3dl3w8,oceanbuddhabear,3,Fri Jul 17 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"I say this matter of factly, not in a pity myself way, I just have noticed, that the people who know me, love me, and the people who don't understand me, or misinterpret me, really don't think much of me at all. I find myself receiving a lesser amount of respect than those who I would consider my equals.   This stuck out at me as I was reading this. Two possibilities come to mind, and in one of them you're totally correct and objective. In the other, this is the borderline warping your perception. You seem like the type to value objectivity, so I hope my saying this doesn't offend or anything. It's just something that very much echoes statements made by the borderline person in my life. So the correlation could be a coincidence, a reaction people make to mental illness such as borderline (I don't think I've seen it to my bipolar, but I've been pretty stable for awhile), or it could be a warping of perception. And I hope that by entertaining that possibility you find the comfort of being wrong.  Edit: it now occurs to me that you might not be saying this applies to the people that know and love you, even if my reading of it suggests to me it does include it.  goes back to reading your post  finished reading...yes, all of it  I'm sorry he's such a dickwad to you. I hope this isn't a fucked up kind of tokenism leading me to say this, but if you're looking for angry music, Against Me! has some fantastic stuff for that if you don't know them. (The tokenism would be that the lead singer is trans, and their music has increasingly focused on her experience as a transwoman. I think I'm hoping that if you don't already know them, they kick ass, and the focus on what it's like to be trans (these are the only folks I know of singing about it) might give you strength. Their songs involving things like addiction, struggle with mental health, recover, and suicidal ideation have brought me strength. They're one of my two favorite bands.  Yeah, housemate's a dickbag douchehat assfuck. And it sucks ruminating on stuff like this. It holds in the hurt. And maybe we need to to process it and move on so it doesn't stay with us longer, but it's still a bitch. Maybe if it's still bugging you today you'll find exercise will help you get it out. I've sometimes found some weight training is a good way to get this shit out of my system (and get fitter).  Stay strong man."

I have had people say that no one takes me seriously, and that I could say one thing and get a negative reaction, and someone else could say the same thing and exact same wording, and get a positive reaction. But no doubt I'm warping, so maybe I'll need to brush up on my social skills and do some introspection.  But yeah I'll talk to my psychologist about it also.

I lived in my car for a month until I got an apartment. I've never been better as a result. Mental health is so heavily influenced by the environment you're in, and if an environment becomes toxic, escaping it is the best way out. But you shouldn't be the one to leave. He's the one who is spinning himself out of control in this environment and he needs a new one. I did something similar with my parents in highschool. I knew that weed was the only thing that allowed manic me to sleep. Zero tolerance in that house. I put us through hell. My sister is borderline, Bipolar and has ptsd. I know what it's like. If you ever need to vent, do not hesitate to pm me. I get it. I want to help."

And while I succeed I'll rise above it, because its something for me and me alone. I remembered something yesterday. In a really bland, unemployed, depressed period of my life, a lady gave my a piece of paper torn out of a book. It read;  ""Even though your job is small, and your rewards are few, remember that the mighty oak, was once a nut like you.""  Its a really special memory. I wrote it on my white board and it just makes me feel calm and grounded throughout the day. And I guess its times like now that make me more driven to achieve fulfilment in life.

It hurts getting bullied and it honestly looks like you are getting gaslighted in a way. He's saying you don't have an illness when you do, tells you what you should be in your sexuality, blames shit you on. He's projecting, big time.   He's unstable. But you can't control other people. You can move out, or deal with it. But you know what you are, what you stand for, and that he is the problem not you. This is key. You have the power to scoff at him now. You don't need to rebuff him. Don't even bother. Prepare yourself mentally. He is a child. He doesn't understand. You are the adult here. You are in control of yourself and how you feel.  I was in a living situation like this kind of. Meditation helped (I know it's weird but it worked.) It helped me center and helped me wash off the negative vibes.   Hope this helps."

What I've found helps a ton with this (and I realize I'm a broken record about it but that's because it works) is mindfulness and meditation. Specifically compassionate meditation because it changes the way you see people like this. Instead of feeling like the victim, you'll see that he behaves like this because he's sick in his own way. He may not have bipolar but he sounds like a spiritually and emotionally unwell person. Healthy people don't treat others like that. You don't have to respond, judge, or react to this behavior at all. Simply observe his behavior and if you're feeling it, meditate on him being free from his overwhelming pain that's spilling out onto other's. Treat him as you would want to be treated if you were in a bad state, but no need to try to change him. Only he can do that for himself.  Secondly, you may want to reconsider your living situation. I know you don't want to, but you need to take care of yourself. Not engage in a battle to ""win."" You'll expend so much energy buffering yourself from the toxicity, that's energy better spent elsewhere. Best of luck."

But at the same time I want to move onwards. I'm not interacting with him at the moment, and he isn't towards me, but I'm just focusing on getting stuff done right now, and taking advantage of the summer.

The odds of him reading it and having an epiphany is slim to none. At best he may ignore you, at worst he'll find some way to mock you for it.

I don't know what your situation is but if the person is an asshole you should move out or try. That's what I'm going to do.  It's really hard and you can't control/fix other people. If you're like me it's best to just be alone because there's nothing other people can do for you. No one understands and if your social experiences are all negative then loneliness is preferred. Better to be alone than in misery.  I actually figured out life by the way, I don't know if you know this but I'll tell you right now. Assertiveness and confidence are what work, what's right or correct isn't important. People are shallow and judgmental and no one necessarily gets what they deserve or earns it. Some people are just treated better.  I'm not a fighter and I'm not doing some lord of the flies bullshit. If I was stuck on an island by myself I might try, but if I have to cooperate or deal with others maybe I'll just drown at sea, like that one kid in the book. It's not worth it.  You don't want to become the thing you hate. They say if you can't beat em then join em, but that's retarded. It's okay to lose. No one has to understand. It's better than putting on a show and losing who you are for the sake of those who don't even care about you or try to understand.  Anyway Fred and Ronny are the bad guys right?

BipolarReddit,3dit4k,Infuser,5,Thu Jul 16 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, the best a doctor can do is give an educated guess.

BipolarReddit,3dit4k,JennyBeckman,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"Well, in terms of mechanism of action, they should be able to give you an explanation. Dosage is another matter entirely.  Without testing, usually by just trying it out, you can't know the dosage someone will need, or if it will even work for them. This is not only based on how well the person responds to the meds--for instance, maybe someone has receptors that just aren't that receptive (hurr hurr) to the drug--but also have fast they metabolize them (some genetic testing is available for this, though it's accuracy is still debated). Too fast and you have a drug that has a strong effect, maybe even too strong, but no longevity. Too slow, and your body might not even get much of an effect. For these reasons, the best they can do on dosage is estimate based on body weight then see what happens."
BipolarReddit,3dit4k,Infuser,4,Thu Jul 16 20:21:36 2015 UTC,I gotta agree with /u/JennyBeckman. They make educated guesses and have a very basic understanding of how they work. But nobody is really sure exactly how they work.   It's kinda like we see they've got some properties that work in some patients some of the time.   Anti-psychotics we have a little bit better understanding but that's because we have a little bit better understanding of schizophrenia.  Lithium is a complete mystery. And even something like Wellbutrin is questionable.
BipolarReddit,3dit4k,Infuser,3,Thu Jul 16 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I never meant to imply that anyone knows exactly the mechanism of any psychiatric drug on the level of brain change that SSRI's induce. Just meant that a good doctor should be able to explain the current theory behind it and tell you why it's supposed to help you.  The explanation behind SSRI's definitely changes all the time, if not at a status of ""shit happens, what the hell."" The other month, there was something about how the serotonin level change was not the direct cause of either the anxiolytic or anti-depressant effect, which makes it even more confusing."

He was too taken aback that I would even joke about something like that, that he couldn't even come up with a response.

BipolarReddit,3dkl0q,buhfiwefoilf,4,Fri Jul 17 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience (so for whatever this is worth) psychiatrists don't like it when you just go off your meds and expect them to immediately deal with the aftermath. You feel your suicidal thoughts were caused by the seroquel, your dr may feel it was due to not a high enough dose or it not having started working yet. But you stopped before he/she could evaluate you.   It's important that your doctor respect what you have to say, listen and treat you appropriately. But sometimes we need to acknowledge that we have some responsibility. (Which is sometimes not possible because keeping myself alive is about the best I can do at times.) I know myself and my body, but I have nowhere near her knowledge of psychopharmacology. So I do what I know works for me (diet, exercise, meditation, etc.), I put forth a good effort, keep appointments, report symptoms and side effects promptly, and allow her to do her job. If not, yeah, I'll be shown the door. There are plenty of other patients who would take my seat. Fuck yeah it's scary giving someone control, because, well it's our brain. The meds aren't perfect, side effects suck, but sometimes things can mitigate the side effects or time helps, whatever. Either way, your relationship with your dr requires mutual respect and trust. If you don't have that get a new one instead of trying to practice medicine vicariously through your current one. Try to not take it personally, ask to be bumped up if there's a cancellation, and in the meantime go to the ER if you're in danger of killing yourself."

I trust what my doctor says but i know what i was like on the medication and what i was like off it, and off it is definitely worse. By a large margin so even though the dr has years of experience and a vast knowledge base to draw from, im not happy with his basing his opinion off a 5 minute chat."
BipolarReddit,3dkl0q,highvoltage1,4,Fri Jul 17 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Offmymeds raises a valid point doctors much prefer you consult them before deciding any medication changes.   Your tone suggests whatever the doctor recommends you are unlikely to listen to if you think its wrong. Pdocs train for a long time and have a lot of clinical experience. Treatment is a partnership and should function as such where both patient and doctor listen to each other. Sometimes all they need is a quick 5min chat.
BipolarReddit,3dkl0q,RallyK,3,Fri Jul 17 09:39:25 2015 UTC,Just FYI the therapeutic dose of Seroquel is at least 400 mgs.  It could just be you're mixed and Seroquel is having no effect because it hasn't hit therapeutic dose. Or it could be Seroquel is giving you suicidal thoughts.  I'm sorry you're not being validated.
BipolarReddit,3dkl0q,highvoltage1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Hi  I understand how you feel. Being in an episode sucks and waiting to see a doctor sucks even more. Rude and bad receptionists don't help either. Sometimes receptionists have no discretion or politeness.   The Doctor probably did not give that message and more likely was expressing that he/she is backed up and Aug 14 is the earliest he/she can see you. Unfortunately, Pdocs, in my experience, are generally flat out. As a result, I have had to get good at waiting. I know my pdoc has done 12-13 hours of back to back patients (how? I have no clue). Wait for doctors, wait for drugs to work, wait for a change in mood etc etc. Being mentally sick is all about waiting.   Maybe you can talk to your Doc about this the next time you see them, at least this would resolve the issue. And I don't see the harm in calling tomorrow like you intend.   If you do end up waiting, take it easy and try to do things you like."

BipolarReddit,3dj41p,HuayChivo,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"custom night guard all the way. Likely you have been doing it all your life and only now are seeing the distinct signs of damage on your teeth. I had my dentist complaining about my grinding long before I was even officially diagnosed as bipolar let alone getting treatment.   The cheap guards will work, but I'm a serious grinder and I chewed holes through the cheapies within a month. It took 3 different styles of custom mouth guards before my dentist got one that would survive long term.  I tried the squishy on the inside and hard on the outside ones and cracked it within 6 months, full squishy my teeth shredded, I had a full hard one I cracked within a year. Now I have one that is super thick between the fronts of my teeth and my molars cannot touch at all. Works awesome! All the holes were getting made by my molars anyways and I can clench to my hearts content and protect my teeth.  You might even be aware that you grind or clench during the day. When I was in school I brought my mouthguard with me to wear during tests. Now I wear mine while commuting to work.  I am on 250mg lamictal, 3 mg lunesta, 50 mg cymbalta"

My dentist made me a custom night guard and it helps, but the dry mouth in the morning is so much more when I have it in. My left side is grinded down by 15% so if the trend keeps up I wont have any teeth by the time I hit 45 so its worth investing in the night guard."

It stopped. You probably also get dry mouth? Get a prescription toothpaste. You'll get a lot of cavities otherwise.   BTW Lamictal can make PCOS worse and I wish I could find the article on it causing PCOS in high risk women who would otherwise be fine.  www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/investigating-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-women-bipolar-disorder

Side note: today I realized that jeans that fit me about 25 pounds ago still fit me today because my butt shrank from running so much -_-   I mean, think about that. I work out so much that my butt shrinks but because of the PCOS, I gain in the front. It's simultaneously amazing and insane and frustrating.

They are basically just a training tool for your jaw muscles.  They are soft and you basically chew them in your sleep which strengthens your grinding muscles.  Your jaw needs to bite down on something hard to discourage grinding.  If you are concerned, which it sounds like you are because you posted in this forum about it, don't delay getting a guard, or you will permanently damage your teeth.  You can wear the enamel down and crack teeth."

BipolarReddit,3dh4k5,lereddit9gag,2,Thu Jul 16 07:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, caffeine isn't too good for many people, including most of us I imagine. I personally can drink a Coke bottle or a cup of coffee, anything more brings the shaking, sweating and anxiety. And from experience: never drink caffeine before you are going to sleep. Preferably stop 8 hours before your planned sleeping time, so the substance has enough time to clear out of your system.  My SO's dad drinks a can (5 cups?) worth of coffee every night just before heading to bed. That is how bad it can get if you build up tolerance for too long!"

My teas are not caffeinated, I drink sprite, I don't drink any coffee. Sure I'm slow in the mornings till about 9am but eventually I wake up fully and I am moving forward.

BipolarReddit,3dk5di,-chloedancer-,3,Fri Jul 17 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"Seroquel is approved for both mania and depression, so nominally it should be considered a mood stabilizer if you ask me. I believe it's not approved for maintenance treatment, but that could just be because of a lack of clinical trials. Yeah, 375 equaling 400 sounds stupid, but it's close enough considering you're working with samples.  And I believe there was a time when I was just on seroquel and an antidepressant. I was stable too. Just dumb as fuck and gaining a lot of weight. (seroquel xr 800mg for two semesters=struggling grades and tens of lbs of weight gain).  And /u/ssnakeggirl has a point that didn't occur to me at first, even after reading it. A lot of xr pills are only xr because of a coating on the outside, so cutting one in half may make it substantially less xr. Still, if only 75mg are functionally non-xr, it may not be too bad a thing. But yeah, asking your pharmacist would be a good idea, even if it making it non-xr would make your pdoc sound wrong. It's a small thing and in my opinion not worth leaving them over. It doesn't sound all that weird for what my pdoc would do, and although mine's a bit nontraditional, she's very competent."

I've been on medication for a couple of years now and I still get nervous about new meds (about to start lamictal and I can't stop worrying about the rash). Overall though, my quality of life has improved. Just be patient with it, some docs will titrate you up the whole way on a med before trying another, and if that med just isn't working, no amount will. So, it can take a long time to find the right cocktail.  As for things getting worse, its not that bad. You notice something getting worse and you call your pdoc. They'll likely tell you to stop taking it or taper off. It happened to me and I waited to call (don't wait to call!), but it ended up being fine."

BipolarReddit,3di04u,RuthBaderMeinhof,6,Thu Jul 16 12:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yes there is a form of bipolar where you cycle into depression and into a normal mood state. It's informally called ""soft"" bipolar.  I had it for many years until I went hypomanic.  Lamictal is mostly for depression and even if you weren't bipolar there are plenty of bipolar meds used to treat treatment resistant depression.  I don't think what your doc is doing is all too far fetched. She isn't putting you on heavy duty stuff like an anti-psychotic.  Read a book called ""Why Am I Still Depressed"" it is written by a psychiatrist about ""soft"" bipolar."
BipolarReddit,3di04u,RallyK,5,Thu Jul 16 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"Very true. This site has a lot of information about the condition:  http://psycheducation.org/  Basically, if you have a depression which just won't respond well to normal antidepressants, you may get better with medication meant for bipolar. Why does this happen? Nobody knows for sure. It's a controversial thing at the moment, but the whole mood spectrum theory is gaining support in psychiatrist circles.  I still think that ""soft bipolar"" is a bad name for this, something like depression+ would be a lot better and less misleading. But maybe it has something to do with the fact that many - RallyK included - develop a ""traditional"" bipolar disorder later."

Unipolar depression doesn't mean depressed 100% of the time, you ""cycle"" up to normal.  That being said, maybe your doc is seeing things you're not aware of? Like maybe he/she noticed pressured speech or something? I would press him/her to explain the diagnosis. Ask a lot of questions like why they changed it to bipolar and what unipolar depression would look like/how is your case different from unipolar.

I feel this connection to the enduring pain of all of humanity, and to the long chain of my miserable, mentally ill ancestors. I cry for them.     Even though I don't logically believe in a divine presence, I become somewhat religious. I find comfort in the abstract rituals of my cultural Catholicism. I drive too fast. I talk too fast. (I'm embarrassed of the talking, but can't stop.) My whole world speeds up, and my brain becomes a train station with four or five trains barreling through at once. I feel like I can sense hidden connections between events, and I'm somewhat paranoid. There are hidden meanings everywhere. I sometimes doodle obsessively, or write my name over and over, or write out the names of every character on a given TV show. or in a book. I don't recognize myself in the mirror sometimes.

I think I mostly downvote offensive things and things that could result in painful consequences. Is it bad to discourage risky behavior? I think it shouldn't be.  Have you been having problems with people downvoting redundant or controversial, but not dangerous, posts? (An example of a dangerous post would be recommending someone on benzos and an AED go off all meds cold turkey (which would all too easily result in seizures)).  Yeah, I'll link old posts when people ask repeat questions, but this is more to show other people's responses so they see even more responses to their question than are posted to their post.  TL;DR: Has this actually been an issue for anyone? I honestly haven't noticed it here. (Disclaimer: I pretty much never use /r/depression, and I'm seldom on /r/bipolar)  Edit: I'm expecting backlash for this post. I don't mean to say no one should try and dissuade people from engaging in dangerous behavior, but I am saying dangerous suggestions shouldn't be given extra visibility."

BipolarReddit,3dci3b,Odramabama,8,Wed Jul 15 04:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Me. You've described me.  My therapist thinks it's my horrible childhood. I think that's part of it. A small part of it. Because when I look deep down I don't quite think it's that.  It's like an icy Great Wall. A lack of energy and forward momentum. An inability to truly bond. They see it and feel it and that's the worst.   I'm lonely. But being with someone or not being with them makes no difference.   I think what it really is at the bottom of it all is that I don't understand what it's like to be a human being, doing human things for their own sake. What is the purpose of that? I feel more like an observer of what it is to be human than an active participant.   This is a terrible trait in a partner. Just an absolutely terrible trait."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,RallyK,4,Wed Jul 15 05:55:05 2015 UTC,"My suspicion is that if I ever found myself in a relationship I would awaken one day in horror and think: ""What have I done?""  From that moment on all affection would be gone, replaced by thinly concealed and entirely undeserved contempt, and in a few weeks we'd go our separate ways after a quick series of incomprehensible explanations on my part.  Well, that's no suspicion; it actually happened. And it's hardly limited to women, but to all of existence. I seem to find everything intolerable after a short time, and though the alternative is rarely tolerable either, at least it takes less work for the same misery.  It has to be one of the worst traits possible in a partner, if the term partner can even be legitimately used. The only certainty is that one day people like me will leave either mentally, physically, or through uglier methods. We can hardly be said to have ever been there at all."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,Vormav,2,Wed Jul 15 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, what is it that causes that 180 from affection to complete contempt? It will be an over night thing, and by the morning i know i no longer want to be with that person.  And it's not like a passing fancy either. I feel like in a situation like this most people would figure out down the line that they regretted that decision and blah blah blah. But as soon as i get rid of that person, all i can think is ""Good riddance."" Fuck i don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, but i've killed a lot of relationships and friendships like this."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,theffffffrabbit,2,Wed Jul 15 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"I don't do this as often as you seem to, but I've experienced that 180 a fair few times. I've noticed this tends to happen when I start relationships/fall in love when I'm manic. The day I crash I wake up the next morning and about 90% of the time I absolutely cannot fucking stand the person I loved the day before. Every little thing they do annoys me, to the point of physical revulsion. I used to try and hang on to it, assuming I'd even out and feel differently, but I don't anymore because I've learned that once I've made that swing I'll never feel affectionately about them again."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,ashtastic10,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:55 2015 UTC,"Very well put about not feeling entirely human. In a way I have detached myself from humanity. I, at this point, am acting to make others more comfortable, if that makes sense."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,ferosa_rosa,3,Wed Jul 15 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"I can relate to a lot of aspects you've mentioned. I also feel like I need a lot of alone time in relationships and in my experience it can be hard for a SO to understand that. I think par of this has to do with the irritability I experience while being around others. On top of that, I'm a cold person and can cut someone off easily without surfacing much emotion. I chalk it up as just being who I am as a person -- maybe its a combination of my bipolar and the way I grew up but who knows. I have had successful relationships regardless. Sometimes I have to stretch myself to give my SO what they need in terms of sympathy/affection/quality time, etc. but there's always going to be compromise in relationships. I think you can definitely achieve a successful relationship if its not hastened and doesn't feel forced."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,techentropystew,2,Wed Jul 15 08:17:08 2015 UTC,"My problem is that every relationship feels forced. I've only had a very few amount of friendships that don't feel this way.   I dunno, maybe i am being in a pessimist by saying i will neverrr have a successful relationship. But mostly i feel like that's just me being cynical and a realist. The only person i can see myself happy with is someone who's as fucked up as me. But then that doesn't work because we help each other spiral into even further fucked up-ness. I am only 22, so i'm probably overthinking things...  I'm not sad or upset at the fact i'll probably never have a successful relationship or ever be married. I'm just worried that maybe that's a sign of something that's really wrong within me."
BipolarReddit,3dci3b,ashtastic10,3,Wed Jul 15 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"i just think people with problems attract other people with problems.

It lost all effect except for vertigo and brain shocks after about six months.  I keep getting put back on SNRIs, these past few years, with an antipsychotic as a mood stabilizer. Honestly, I feel like they now do nothing, though if I don't take them (effexor or cymbalta, depending on the prescription of the time) exactly at the same time every day I get a NASTY withdrawal - within a few hours, suicidal ideation and desire to self-injure like I've never felt before I was on these meds."

When I do traditional journaling, I try and wait until the end of the day and summarize how the day went. I also put an arrow (up = above baseline, down = below baseline) and 1-10 (or -3 to 3) rating at the top of the page to indicate overall mood.  I'm still figuring out which way I like best or if I will just do both. I like the graphs the app provides, but I also like having a detailed account of daily moods."

It also generates a graph with all the data that you can print out and bring with you to your doctors.   I like to see how it looks in graph form.

My point is that I am on lamictal and my grandmother recently died, and I feel like I am unable to grieve. I was sad, I did tear up at her funeral, but I have a desire to just break down and weep and have some sort of catharsis that is just not happening, and I think it is because of the lamictal."
