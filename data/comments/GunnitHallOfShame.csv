They see it as, sure it has some drawbacks but at the end of the day its a tool that does whats its made for. I am trying to just get a good argument for this question is all. Knowing some varied opinions on this topic will help me organize my thoughts so i can write a proposal on a similar theme but a different market altogether. This may not be the right sub to ask it in (and remove my post if you want) but i feel really only gun owners knows the woes of owning and firing a flint lock weapon."

GunnitHallOfShame,3dgwqz,Wichitawesome,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:48 2015 UTC,"For the most part, maybe a 60/40 split.  Democrats appeal to people who want forward thinking. This can be very good. Forward thinking includes sensibility (to an extent) towards gun ownership and the laws surrounding it. It then inherently caters to people who want to make the bad man go away but without any pain or violation. Hence, gun control.  ""Common sense gun control"" is the new catch phrase. There isnt a democratic candidate for the coming election who won't use that phrase at some p.   However, if you as a gun owner have enjoyed increased freedoms and reduced restrictions, it doesn't make sense to vote democrat."
GunnitHallOfShame,3dgwqz,agemma,3,Thu Jul 16 23:42:43 2015 UTC,Nice writeup. I like your opinion on that.

No one cares if people smoke. It's not a big deal, no one thinks is dangerious or will hurt you or someone else. The problem isn't even that someone smoking it is committing a crime. It's gun owners doing it. This is a page specifically for guns, so the ability to own one is pretty high up on their concerns. Weed+guns=felony, felony=no guns. And there's even people who don't see a problem with having both, but posting about owning guns and smoking weed is just dumb. Since /r/guns has been targeted by media before, everyone would prefer we try to give them as little reason to talk about us as possible. That means no discussions about illegal things. And even then it isn't untill someone admits to doing both or encouraging others to that the bans are brought out."

You can get it from the Chrome/Firefox extensions interface and once you have it just click the little gear icon at the top and switch to night mode, which by default also disables subreddit styles. In addition to a number of other subtle improvements, it allows you to put custom tags for users that only you can see, but can help you keep track of users if that's your thing.

GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,Mastercutlet,16,Tue Jul 14 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"This is how I got my car. I went to a parking lot, found what I liked. I was in luck, he didn't have the VIN blocked so I wrote it down. After that i waited for the owner to come out. I told him I had the VIN written down, so his car was now mine. He wasn't very happy, but he knew there was nothing he could do since I was able to record the VIN. I hopped in, covered it up for my own protection, and bam...free car."
GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,NotALeezurd,4,Tue Jul 14 05:49:33 2015 UTC,"Actually the real process for car theft isn't much different. Step 1) buy salvage vehicle, remove the vin. Step 2) steal car, same manufacture, make, model and year as salvage vehicle. Step 3) put salvage vin on stolen car. Step 4) retitle under new vin, register at DMV  Granted there's still the hidden vins through the car but fuck it, you just got a free car for the low cost of like 6 felony charges per vehicle."
GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,Ruhlmdc,2,Tue Jul 14 14:48:26 2015 UTC,But wouldn't the end product have a VIN that is flagged as stolen? How would you retitle and re-register that?
GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,PleaseStopCalling,2,Wed Jul 15 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"The key is the salvaged vehicle.  When you legally buy a salvaged vehicle, you're buying a totaled vehicle.  It's how insurance companies get some of the money back after you total your car.  The car is usually gone to shit but what it does give you is a clean vin and a clean title.  So you take this clean vin and clean title and go hunt for an identical car to the one belonging to that vin.  Once you find it, you find a way to steal it (numerous ways of going about this part).  Then you remove the vin belonging to the stole car, replace it with the vin belonging to the salvage vehicle and now you have a stolen car which appears to be a restored salvage vehicle.  You get that car retitled under your name with the new vin, and there you go, a nice salvage special.  You can drive this around if you want but eventually you'll probably be caught.  Best thing to do is to do the retitling under a false identity and sell it via a private sale for cash to your run of the mill chump.  Chump sees an ad for 60k like brand new used car going for 15k and thinks ""WOW WHAT A DEAL"" rather than ""That's almost definitely stolen"", gets the cash together, and buys it.  Seller is gone to the wind, no evidence of who they are, cash is gone and the buyer is stuck with a stolen vehicle.  EDIT: I may intentionally be leaving a step or two out of this for any potential criminals out there."
GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,Ruhlmdc,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:00 2015 UTC,Ooooooh. Herp derp. I'm slow tonight. I got it mixed up and thought you were putting the stolen vin on the salvage car. That was not making sense in my head.

GunnitHallOfShame,3d75pv,enternameinthisfield,11,Tue Jul 14 02:43:37 2015 UTC,A police uniform.  Also make sure your badge puts you at the rank of General so they automatically take your word for it based on superiority and experience.

This may not be the optimal place for it, but I'd like to know something...if I too could be considered a Fudd for this: For first time gun owners that may have not had a significant upbringing at all with firearms (and possibly with 'bubba' who disregards safety), could they be presented the opportunity to enroll in government subsidized (as far as paying firearms instructors) classes that cover operation, local laws, safety, maintenance, storage and storage with children, in order to minimize accidents and theft, free of charge?  The fact it would be free would be the incentive to want to take the classes because hey, education and training are always a good thing. Record keeping of who has enrolled and completed the classes would be kept to a minimum, and under NO circumstances be handed over to other government agencies to prevent it being used as a registry."

It's not fudd to think that, but honestly I feel it would only attract the types of people who wouldn't need the class. The ones who ignore local laws and safety and maintenance and storage, typically do so because they think they already know better."
GunnitHallOfShame,3cfxaf,Efanito,2,Tue Jul 7 23:03:46 2015 UTC,"Ah that is the tricky part.  I wouldn't want to force anything, because rights aren't and shouldn't be forced.  Like I have said though, the opportunity of taking the classes would be presented (and still available to not-first-time gun owners should they want refreshers or to learn something new), but those people that think they know better may decline it anyway.  It is not compulsory, but they would only be hurting themselves (and sadly, possibly others too)."
GunnitHallOfShame,3cfxaf,tash68,0,Tue Jul 7 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"It is not compulsory, but they would only be hurting themselves (and sadly, possibly others too).   While I'm certainly not arguing that it should be compulsory, my point is that nothing would change. The people who disregard gun safety don't care enough about it to go out and educate themselves. If they did, they wouldn't do stupid shit with their firearms in the first place. You might attract people like me who get bored and always like to learn, but I'm (in my opinion) safe around firearms."

We just need to stop engaging them on the ""assault gat"" issue. Crazy dudes with ARs are so minute when looking at murder and even gun crime in the US they literally are within the margin of error within the FBI's own murder statistics.  Make them talk about places like Chicago and San Francisco, and their staggering murder rates. Make them explain how up to 80% of crime in these areas is gang related, and how much of the murder is hilariously racially motivated to such a degree that we shouldn't have even discussed Newtown for half as long as we did."
GunnitHallOfShame,3cfxaf,Zombiedrd,2,Tue Jul 7 19:59:51 2015 UTC,They trigger at any mention or race and discredit you.  Chicago was probably all low capacity shitty handguns and shotguns and their gun control is pretty heavy up there. Most major cities are grey areas that aren't really under government control. Probably focus on the epic failure of draconian gun control in those areas. Maybe just explain Brazil to them.

The orginal mod posted up someplace saying he was going to leave it closed.   I guess the other subs listed had voat.co links on them. I skimmed the comments, saw /r/crappydesign up and running with a new mod post and group running it then ran over to request and started working on your sub so it would not fall into the wrong hands."

I thought I would be nice and invite the other WG mods and 300blackout but I guess I was wrong in doing so.   At the time I was doing this the admins of reddit agreed that I should be doing it, If not they would have never told me how to request the sub since it was redirecting to a post 4 years ago that was made.     re: Hello mods I can not request the sub because someone did 4 years ago  from Sporkicide [A] via /r/redditrequest/ sent 10 hours ago  You can definitely request it.

Because to them, there's no such thing as a bad post. This isn't elementary school. There is such a thing as a stupid question and there are such a thing as shitposts.

Here's a dark, grainy picture of it sitting on my bed sheet."" A post should be something worth learning about/ seeing. If I wanted to see a Glock 19, I'd google them and there'd probably be much nicer pictures online. Gunnit must be doing something right, otherwise /r/GunVine would have taken off like a rocket.

If you find me harsh step up and do not over react to what I am saying. You know as well as I do that to many people Fake shit all the time for money   elves86 Not that it's any of your business , but obviously I am seeing a counselor. You figure that most people make shit up, so that gives you the right to attack me? You have no idea what it's like be woman in the positions I've been in. Yes, actually, I DO want a water birth, in a birth center, where they have ACTUAL knowledge of how my body works, and respect for my wishes, where they don't plan to pump me & my baby full of unnecessary drugs, or strap me to a table, or perform invasive procedures without informing me OR asking my consent, where I can be confident that they are not planning from the get go for me to give up and submit to abdominal surgery that I don't need because they have no faith in the way that the birth process was designed to work. So yeah, that's my plan, to make every possible sacrifice and more that we can so that our daughter can be born into safety, dignity and peace.    You bring up a very valid point, and she takes it up as an attack and goes a bit /r/conspiratard. Sounds legit.  Not really GHoS-y in my opinion, but still an interesting find.

I have barely slept for months, and yesterday my son decided that 4am was a great wake up time before I had to work. I'm 7 months pregnant, and obviously struggling with my emotions and my stress. I am resistant to giving out personal information, as it's emphasized to us pretty much every single day as military members that we are , and vulnerable to attack. Someone on the Internet can do a hell of a lot with even just a little information. I should never even have posted my gfm page here, I regret it now.  As for the stolen valour, that is fucking uncalled for. I signed on the bottom line and gave Uncle Sam a blank check for 6 years of my life. I have served my country and my shipmates.

As for the stolen valour, that is fucking uncalled for.   Not really. Now I'm not saying you're lying about your service, simply that we have to be cautious about taking people's words at face value when it comes to military service, especially when they're asking for money and sites like http://www.stolenvalor.com/ exist. And when, politely I might add, you were asked to for the most basic of proof of your service, you instead just made attacks on the person and went on rants.  And /u/MethAintUmich made a certain post:   What is your MOS and branch? Where did you go to basic. PM me your OS contact. I have many friend still in and will vet you, when you come back legit which I assume you will, I will get reddit to fund your birth.   There aren't many people I would believe when they make a claim that they'll get reddit's support, but /u/MethAintUmich is one of them. But you apparently haven't taken any of his suggestions for solutions to finding out whether you're lying or not. And all I can say is as of two hours ago, he still hasn't gotten anything from you, and a picture in uniform is tenuous, he provided a great option in the applying to work for reddit thing.   But this is the internet, of course people are going to question you and your motives when you ask them for money. And of course there are going to be people who are assholes (like the first response to your request). You just have to deal with that and be ready to back your story up, which you've not done.

It all just screams of someone who hasn't experienced what they claim they've experienced.

GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Zombiedrd,4,Tue Jun 30 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"I remember basic high school history, and even I knew they made the Spartans WARRIORS and had slaves so they could support their population. He's probably thinking of the Athenians. Or he's not thinking at all."
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Caedus_Vao,3,Tue Jun 30 05:15:56 2015 UTC,"Basically there was 3 classes.  Spartans- Warriors who lived in barracks and only trained/fought their entire lives and ran Sparta.  Perioeci- Who were basically half free. They could own land and fight in the army but had no political power or rights.  Helots- these were slaves. They worked the fields/homes and supported the army in campaign by carrying gear and dealing with the supply trains.  Every year Spartans trained by culling the helots. They kept them in line so to speak by night raiding their homes and killing dissents. It wasn't until The Great Earthquake, combined with a Helot uprising and long wars against Phillip of Macedonia and Athens dwindled down the numbers of ""Spartiates"" (aka Spartans) that Sparta finally failed as a city state."
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Caedus_Vao,3,Tue Jun 30 05:25:11 2015 UTC,Oh and another little fun fact: Due to the earthquake and Helot uprising Sparta wasn't able to accompany Alexander the Great. Which I feel is a bit ironic as the Spartans historically loved mettling with the Persians more than Athens did. Thermopylae would have never happened if Athens didn't piss off Darius.

GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Caedus_Vao,3,Tue Jun 30 05:37:22 2015 UTC,i just enjoy military history in general and specifically Historic Generals. That lead me to studying Sparta and Ancient Greece.   One more thing: Sparta was at all times ruled by two kings. One would be on campaign against other Greeks and one at home to rule. They would then switch. They kinda had a democracy but militarily ruled by a monarchy if that makes sense. Leonidas co ruled with his brother who was banished from Sparta for being a traitor to Persia.
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,terraspatial,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"Didn't Sparta kinda be pirates for the Persians in the century after the events at Thermopylae? Been a while since my last classes at college, but in the century between the war and Phillip II and Alexander, I swear I read that after the War petered out, the Persians played the Greeks against each other, to give them breathing room, paying some to attack others."
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Caedus_Vao,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:09:10 2015 UTC,"IIRC it was a sect of Sparta in modern day turkey that allied with other Greek colonies there to help the Persians.

When I'm fabulously wealthy, I'll be making historical biopics and dramas, 50% painstakingly accurate and the other 50% will make /r/badhistory froth at the mouth."
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,Prufrock451,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure some dude entered Reddit lore when he took an AskReddit question of ""what would happen if you took a full modern military battalion (and support staff) and dropped it into the middle of the Roman Empire?"" and wrote up a short story based on that scenario.  He supposedly got his little short story turned into a screenplay and sold the rights to it. No idea if Hollywood's ever done anything with it, but that would be a pretty cool movie."
GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,SpiveyArms,5,Tue Jun 30 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"/u/Prufrock451  IIRC;  I remember reading it during the original submission some years back, he's chimed in a few times about the development that ""Rome, Sweet Rome"" is in right now.  It was a cool little piece of fiction.  Very similar to Turtledove's ""Lost Legion of Videssos"" series, where a Roman legion gets transported to some weird Babylonian-esque culture and totally dominate the battlefield, start to integrate themselves into the native society.   Turtledove wrote a fantastic little ""what if"" called ""Guns of the South where a bunch of South African and Rhodesian white supremacists traveled back in time to 1862, gave General Lee a shitload of AK's and penicillin.   Not particularly deep, but an entertaining read."

GunnitHallOfShame,3blhps,jmf101,2,Tue Jun 30 16:00:58 2015 UTC,"Turtledove is very, very entertaining.  He likes to mix historical figures and fictional characters together in a bunch of different vignettes that jump back and forth during the narrative to show what's happening concurrently everywhere.     His World War 1 series (basically WW1 in the US following the pattern of what real WW1 was like) between the US and CSA, with all the other belligerent nations weighing in on one side of the other.  It's good, about 5 books long, and (of course) sets it up for a WW2 with a Confederate stand-in for Hitler, and of course they start killing black people in a Holocaust parallel.   Entertaining reads, a bit formulaic, but Guns of the South is a standalone that you'd enjoy, not related to those."

Everyone has to be their own boss and the CEO of their own one-employee startup (I've actually seen people calling themselves a CEO in their social media bios). Entrepreneurship is great and all, but when that idea spreads to someone without a speck of creativity, you get stuff like ""Want to look at guns? I'll use Google Image so that you don't have to!"" The guy obviously has some techno savvy if he's contemplating starting an online service, but those skills would be better used as an employee of someone else who doesn't want to be doing the technical stuff."

Yea, dipshits gonna dipshit and they shouldn't be allowed to participate. And yea, it's up to the sniper to vet the target.  There's a ton of reasons to keep it going but at the end of the day, if there's a general shitty attitude from the targets and not enough mod support to make it work then people are gonna get burnt out. Maybe it's time for a bunch of new mods over in secretsniper to take the load off the old-timers.    As far as I know, braus and DA are the only two trying to keep it alive.

I imagine op in a post nuclear apocalypse, running from the other survivors making fun of his gat, eotech still clinging lifeless to the quad rail."

GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,Zombiedrd,2,Fri Jun 26 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of people believe in the end times are coming, it is crazy. Ever see what the Mormons in the West US are up to? They all have small armories and are prepping for it all to crumble/"
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,tash68,7,Fri Jun 26 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the Mormons, a big part of their religious doctrine is that the end times are literally around the corner and it's your duty to be prepared at all times. That's nothing new or recent with them. And somehow they're still less crazy than most preppers, since they tend to normally prep in a rational fashion, not with ultra-zombie-slayer-deluxe-collector's edition rifles with the anti-Lizard People forepenis."
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,terraspatial,6,Fri Jun 26 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Mormon culture has evolved a bit away from ""the end times are nigh,"" to ""be self-suffcient should you ever find yourself in unfortunate circumstances.""  We're encouraged to to be self-sufficient, avoid debt, and have sufficient stores of food (current recommendations from top leadership is 'at least 3 months,' rather than the older recommendations of 'at least a year.') should we fall upon hardship.  The church really started pushing the food storage thing in the 70s when unemployment and inflation were at the worst since the Great Depression, the oil crisis was at a head, and we were well into the middle of the Cold War. Major players in the church leadership in that era included Ezra Taft Benson, former Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower, and he was known for very conservative views.  You have to remember that during that period of time, the idea of the end times was not just something the Mormons feared, it was a very real fear throughout the US. Church membership was beginning to really pick up steam at this point, LDS leaders were (and still are) incredibly influential in terms of LDS members' behavior. So when the leader of your church, once a key member of the Presidential Cabinet, says, ""yo dawg, end times are nigh, get yo shit together,"" you bet everyone's gonna stock up.  We've toned it down. It's more about asking yourself what you're gonna do if you find yourself out of a job next week.... do you have the ability to provide for yourself? What if your brother and his wife and kids have their house destroyed in a hurricane or tornado? Can you (literally) be your brother's keeper and help them out?  It's less tinfoil and more common sense: have an emergency plan for what you're going to do in case of disaster. Have a 72 hour kit. Be prepared to help yourself, and if you can, your neighbors and family. There's nothing crazy about recognizing we live in a world of risk.  /soapbox"
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,tash68,6,Fri Jun 26 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Credit due on the less end is nigh and more be prepared.  But in my defense, I was sort of defending that aspect of Mormon culture, by pointing out that it wasn't as crazy as the poster I originally responded to implied that it was. I just wasn't as nuanced as I probably could've been and made a few generalizations."
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,terraspatial,3,Fri Jun 26 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"My apologies. I wasn't trying to make it like you were attacking them or anything, just wanted to clarify the motives a little."
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,Zombiedrd,3,Sat Jun 27 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, tend to be very sane. One of my old roommates was formerly Mormon, and he told me how it was your duty. I was just making the comment that they are prepping and they have large stores of supplies.  I didn't mean to insinuate the Mormons were crazy, but that it is crazy(Should have used a better adjective, such as surprising) on how many people were preppers.  I used the Mormons because they are a good example of those who are not idiots when it comes to how to do it.  The castles are kinda out there, though."
GunnitHallOfShame,3b5j9u,sleeplessorion,4,Fri Jun 26 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"And even if there was an EMP, it's not that hard to replace your eotech with iron sights. The way he said it made me think that he was expecting an EMP to happen while in combat or whatever. Sounds a lot like a certain level in Modern Warfare 2."

GunnitHallOfShame,3b3ogb,terraspatial,5,Thu Jun 25 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that. I don't want to claim he's stolen valor, it just seems like maybe he's exaggerated some of his military experience a little. I get it... we all wanna look as good as possible, and I know folks who've... been creative, if you will, with their resumes.  The thing that really rubs me the wrong way about that whole post is he makes it sound like he's put a lot of time and work into this to make it like what he had ""in the service,"" when literally less than 48 hours ago, he didn't have an AR and had no idea how to figure out what might be a quality rifle or not. And then he explains that he ""built it"" with    Bought certain components together, but built (or assembled) it just yesterday.   So, he bought an upper, and bought a lower? And then slapped them together? That's my takeaway anyway. In any case, this was not something he put a lot of time and effort into, as far as I can tell. I have more respect for a shitty build that a guy actually tried on, than something that just got slapped together because eh, fuck it."

I'm sure you get better at it, but coughing from feeling like something burned your throat sucks. the tincture I tried was gross. And I didn't feel anything (1 full dropper under tongue for 30 secs). food takes way too long to hit you Is my best option a vape I guess? I tried that as my first experience in like 15 years and was at [11]. It was insane. That's good ;). But it also burned the crap out of my throat. I need a ""cool"" smoke option if I have to smoke :( It's also just... spendy, when I'm not sure I'll really start using on any regular basis. Suggestions!? Also, you ever use a Percocet or Vicodin and like 45 mins in it finally hits you in a wave of soft warm relaxing euphoria? Is there a strain that would offer that? :)   His Post in /r/saplings admitting to smoking and wanting different methods. Post can be found here"

I'm sorry that I haven't lived a life without mistakes, as clearly you have. I made a mistake. Not a lapse in ""always assume the gun is loaded"", etc. I fired my weapon deliberating, down range, when safe to do so. Yes, I stupidly loaded and fired my weapon without removing the laser boresight. It scared the fuck out of me. I locked the weapon away for two YEARS. And when I pop my head back up, and ask a reasonable question of ""is my weapon still safe to use""... Do you feel you responded in a way that remotely helps me, this community, or any community? No. Why? Because you are a fucking douchebag, that's why. To imply I'm a stoner is wonderfully stupid. As you read while poorly stocking me -- I asked about marijuana with respect to back pain, as a way to avoid highly addictive narcotic pain killers... A responsible decision.

They did what any business would or should have done as far as raising prices. Did they go overboard? Probably. The only thing I have a real problem with was how they cancelled processed orders and told customers they can purchase what they had already paid for at the inflated price. That is unethical business practice at best and could be considered fraud by some."

GunnitHallOfShame,39e4tt,TheBoldakSaints,5,Thu Jun 11 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"How they did it was the problem. They canceled processed orders and relisted the items a few days later after ""site maintenance"" at significant markups. I went from having a $400 AMD-65 waiting to be shipped, to ""Oops, sorry we're out of stock here's your money back"", and then they were suddenly in stock three days later for close to $1,000 and I was told if I wanted one to ""just resubmit the order and pay for it""."

GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,tbmcrowley,3,Fri Jun 5 15:13:38 2015 UTC,Yet another person who seems not not understand that you can leave a gun loaded. He's hung up on not getting his AR ready quickly when all it should involve is turning on his red dot sight and taking the safety off.
GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,tbmcrowley,7,Fri Jun 5 15:39:31 2015 UTC,Haven't you heard? AR's kill people. It's okay to leave a .380 loaded because those things barely break the skin.
GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,tbmcrowley,3,Fri Jun 5 15:42:28 2015 UTC,How silly of me. Then again my only handgun is basically a slightly beefed up .32.

GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,JakesGunReviews,2,Fri Jun 5 21:49:33 2015 UTC,They're those little disk-shaped things that go in my aiming tube that makes the red point for aiming in it go on that I buy once every half a dozen years or so.
GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,monkeymasher,3,Fri Jun 5 21:55:13 2015 UTC,Is that a new kind of iron sight or something? What's the sight radius on that? Does it have match apertures?
GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,JakesGunReviews,3,Fri Jun 5 22:00:44 2015 UTC,It's made out of that new iron variant called aluminum and glass.  The sight radius is both ∞ and -∞.  The little dotter things also can come in different sizes and even be used in the nighttimes.
GunnitHallOfShame,38odvl,monkeymasher,2,Fri Jun 5 22:02:21 2015 UTC,Can it attach to my Mattel 16 like the starlight scope? That scope is truly fantastic. This aimpoint you speak of sounds enormous if it's that effective.

I would have posted the original link here but this sub is only for gun subs.   Yes weekendgunnit is satire but more and more we get real questions because people do not want to use /r/askweekendgunnit.

GunnitHallOfShame,37s44b,terraspatial,3,Sat May 30 00:34:33 2015 UTC,I think a leg shot could pretty easily be fatal too     Especially if you use a .45ACP.

Commercial ones were imported with adjustable rear sights in .380 ACP and also 9x18mm (some PMM-types were also imported that held... 10 or 12 rounds, but they are very rare).  Russian military PMs were never approved for import to the United States, but they still pop up, and there are four primary reasons as to why:   Vietnam bring-backs since we could bring souvenirs back still Some got imported with Bulgarian PMs and accidentally imported marked as Bulgarian (but their Izhevsk logo says otherwise) Some were brought over by Russians themselves.  Some say spies left them here when they went back, other say they're gifts from diplomats to people here in the United States. I may or may not know of one or multiple or none that were brought back from either of the two conflicts the United States has had in the Middle East.   Because military PMs were never allowed into the country officially, those that do pop up demand a premium.  A military, Russian PM can easily fetch $700.00+ with some even hitting the $1k mark from what I've seen."

I was tackled by a guy, but as soon as he was on top of me, it was immediately apparent he wasn't a threat.  I just rolled him off of me as I fell backwards, so he ended up on his side with me just above him with my elbow and forearm pinning him down by his ribs, also halfway laying on my side.  Didn't want to try and draw the gun while falling, and didn't really feel like drawing in a compromising position like that.  Also ended up being a non-threat like I mentioned (yelled ""GET DOWN!"" when he tackled me, then started screaming about ""GOOKS IN THE WIRE!"").  Ended up crawling under a table on his hands and knees, screaming the entire time.  I ended up on my hands and knees convincing him I got rid of the gooks for him.  Something tells me it would've gone way worse if I drew a gun on a guy having an episode of PTSD where he thought the enemy was right there, but that I was a friendly.  I would have been seen as an enemy as soon as he saw the gun, I'm sure, and unleashed the rage of a thousand Hueys."

I probably didn't follow this as well as I should've 4 years ago. Maintain awareness of your surroundings at all times. Shit happens when you least expect it. Practice with your weapon and be ready to use it. Carry that fucking weapon. Don’t leave that shit at home. You never know when you’re gonna need it.   I’d like to point out, though, that I don’t completely agree with the idea of “don’t draw your weapon unless you’re going to shoot”. I prefer “don’t draw your weapon unless you’re willing to shoot”. In 3 of these 4 incidents, I wasn't intending to kill anyone, but I had no choice but to draw in order to resolve the situation.   I apologize for the long post, but I’m new to reddit and I didn't know if I should break them up into 4 posts. Anyone? Edit: added TL;DR after each incident  Let me start off with some background. I’m 25. I own a small IT company, plus a couple of small retail stores are located in less than reputable areas. I got my CCW 6 years ago (age 19) when my father and brother-in-law who also own similar businesses were robbed at gunpoint. I also got my FFL about 4 years ago and do some gun business on the side. Fortunately, I haven't been robbed at my store yet, but I have a feeling it's gonna happen sooner or later.   Incident #1: Angry Customer - about 4 years ago  This was at one of my wireless phone stores. This upset customer (black male, ~6’5, ~250 lbs) walks in with a broken cell phone charger and demands a replacement. It wasn’t burned out or anything. The cord was strung out in half with the little colored wires sticking out like a dog chewed it out. I told him I can’t replace it since it’s clearly physically damaged by the user. “Besides, they’re only like ten bucks,” I said. He started getting angry and insisted I either fix it or replace it. “Alright, if you got a receipt I’ll give you a new one,” I said. “They didn't give me no receipt!” he goes. We always give receipts and I've never seen this guy in my life. “It’s all good man, but I need a receipt. If not, I’ll just give you a new one half price. That’s only five bucks,” I said. He starts getting loud and aggressive. “This is bullshit!”, he yells. Now, I’m not one to make a big deal over a $10 charger, but at this point, I’m 99% sure he didn't get it from me and he’s just trying to rip me off while being a douchebag about it. I tell him I’m not going to give him what he wants. He starts getting snippy and talking all kinds of shit. “Mothafucka, this is bullshit,” etc. At this point I've had it with him. I was younger and had less self control, so I told him to “get the fuck outta my store.” He came extremely close to me, like smell his breath close, all in my face close, with an aggressive posture. “Whatchu gonna do muthafucka?” he yelled. He was a big dude, at least twice my weight, and he was standing so close I could swear he was two feet taller than me. All while yelling into my face. I kept pointing at the door trying out-yell him to leave. He hit my computer monitor, knocking it on the floor and shattering it. I panicked and drew my weapon (Beretta M9 IWB at the time), racked the slide (even though I knew it was already chambered) and pointed it at the ground and yelled “Get the fuck outta my store!” as loud as I could. I could see the surprise in his face as he saw the weapon and backed up a few feet. “Get out or I will fucking shoot you!” I yelled in anger. “So you pulling guns on people now? I see how it is”, he said while backing up. He walked away muttering insults. I was just super relieved that he left. I never called the cops because I didn't know if I did the right thing drawing my weapon and didn't wanna get in trouble. I’m not proud of how I handled it. I was younger, and I've learned ever since how to better handle a situation like that.  TL;DR - Angry 6'5 250+ lbs customer is verbally aggressive, stands unusually close, yells, and breaks my computer screen, won't leave - I 'brandished' weapon, he leaves, no shooting, no police  Incident #2: Drunk Asshole - about 2 years ago  I’m in my truck with a this pretty girl, in her driveway after a date. It was getting dark and we’re starting to get flirty if you know what I mean. All the sudden this guy walks up to the passenger side and starts talking to her. It was nice outside and the windows were already rolled down. “Hey what’s up Alice? Whatchu doin?”. He looked like he’d been drinking. I’m already getting worried. “What’s going over there?” I ask. “Who the hell is he? Where’s that money you owe me?” he starts muttering. He said that she owed him money for mowing her lawn. Apparently it was her neighbor down the street and she told me then that she’d already gave him the money. He didn't see that way. Anyway, I ask him how much she “owed” him. It was $25. I pulled $40 out of my wallet and gave it to him and asked him to leave us alone. I guess he was into her and it hurt his feelings. He comes up to my door this time and starts talking shit. “I see you like them pretty boys with the fancy jobs and lotsa money?” At this point he’s getting on my nerves, but whatever. I gotta stay calm. He then goes on to call a her a gold-digging whore. At this point I’m really mad but trying to contain it. By now, I know better than to turn this into something worse. So I’m like dude back off, and I open my door to walk her to her house. The fucker slams the fucking door shut. Onto my fucking leg. I was so mad I kicked the door open with my other leg knocking him on the ground. In her fucking driveway. He gets up and tries to come at me. At this point, I’m like fuck it, I pull out my M9 and point it at him and I tell Alice to call the police. Then the fucker’s like “take it easy man no police it’s all good man im sorry my bad blah blah”. Of course my luck, her battery is dead. I tell her to grab my phone from my jacket pocket with my gun pointed at him. She calls 911, all while asshole starts apologizing. He started backing away slowly to leave and I wasn’t gonna force him into staying. He left before 911 could even get our location. Police finally showed up, filed a report. Told me they can’t arrest him and to go talk to the prosecutor. Prosecutor blew me off. No evidence, no case. I took Alice to the police station the next morning to see about filing a restraining order. I still run into the asshole every once in a while. He gives me this dirty look every time.  TL;DR - Asshole harasses my date/girlfriend, slams my truck door on my leg, then charges at me - I draw my weapon, he leaves, no shooting, no police"

GunnitHallOfShame,36l9nb,Hellspark08,4,Wed May 20 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"Incident #3: Mugger - about 8 months ago  I had recently moved in with my girlfriend at the time (my fiance now) who lived in the city. It was an apartment building with a gated parking lot and we couldn’t find me an available spot, so I had to street park behind the building every night. I’m walking back from my truck and outta fucking nowhere this motherfucker pops out from behind a parked car. About maybe 15 or 20 feet with his hands in his hoodie pockets. He didn't say anything. That moment I freaked the fuck out. He hadn’t said anything yet. I didn’t know what’s in his pockets. ""It could be a knife, it could be a gun. I don’t fucking know. Fuck. Should I confront him? Should I turn around and run? What should I do? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck... "" I just didn't know what the fuck to do. I put my strong hand on my IWB at 5 o’clock, he charges at me and takes his hands out of his pockets. I see a flat object in his hand, couldn't tell what. That moment, my adrenaline was pumped so fucking high, I can’t even begin to explain it. I drew my weapon and pointed right at him. I was fucking speechless. Literally. I couldn't fucking speak. My mind was saying “Stop! Don’t you fucking move!” but the words just couldn’t come out of my mouth. He realizes it was a gun pointed at his face and drops whatever was in his hand (it was a little knife). “Shit! Don’t shoot man! Don’t shoot!” and backs off quickly with his hands up. At this point I’m still fucking speechless. I’m so fucking close to shooting that fucker that I’m squeezing the trigger as hard as I fucking can without it moving back (trigger slack, I carry half cocked). I can’t speak, I can’t move, I can’t think. He kept yelling “don’t shoot” while backing away slowly. I didn't respond to anything he was saying, so he ran off. The apartment building was on the other side of the block. I walked back with my weapon in my hand until I got to the main street which was better lit. Then I holstered my weapon and kept walking with my hand on the handle covered by my jacket. It was fucking crazy, I’m surprised I didn't shit my pants. I didn't call the police because (from experience) shit like this happens all the time in the city and a “black male in a hoodie” description is as useful as the police themselves. That night I drank myself to sleep. I've since moved back into the suburbs and I sleep okay now.  TL;DR - Someone tries to mug me with knife - I draw weapon, he leaves, no shooting, no police. I moved back to suburbs.  Incident #4: Angry Parent - a month ago  I don’t want to go into details one this one as the circumstances surrounding the incident are complicated. In short, I’m at work, angry father of recently terminated employee pushes me into a wall and charges at me. Both my fiance and I draw, I almost shoot. He leaves. I have the whole incident on tape but police told me I have to talk to prosecutor to press charges. I don’t know how I feel about pressing charges or releasing the footage as the ex employee recently passed away. What do you guys think?  Edit: added some formatting to make it easier to read"

From OP's description of the process it sounds like German authorities whisked her away to a mental institution for her immediate safety and treated the problem effectively. This is exactly the type of case where, had it happened in the US it would be a quick and easy (relatively) restoration of rights. OP is just hung up on the fact that it happened overseas.  So maybe not the same as my initial reaction but this doesn't sound like the evil spirit of Sandy Hook descending upon her."

My dream home defense gun is a pistol in either .45ACP or 9mm with 147gr ammo, with the quietest suppressor I can afford."
GunnitHallOfShame,35osf0,InquisitiveLion,2,Tue May 12 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"have you considered a carbine or SBR (in 9 or .45) with a can? I'm thinking that it would be good for this type of thing, or am I wrong?"
GunnitHallOfShame,35osf0,CommanderCooper,1 point,Tue May 12 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"If I think about an SBR for home defense, my mind always goes to an AR build in .300 Blackout. I'm not sure if the size difference between a short AR and a pistol caliber carbine would be worth it, since I'm not too familiar with pistol caliber carbines.  Chances are, I'm going to end up living in a micro apartment for a while, so I always think about a pistol first for home defense. Turning around tight corners with a pistol with a can seems easier than with a rifle and can.  ...Then again, it's going to be a while before I can afford a pistol and can anyway..."

GunnitHallOfShame,35osf0,Mechman13,2,Tue May 12 20:47:29 2015 UTC,I've got a CZ scorpion which is going to be a suppressor host/HD gun once the ATF approves my form 3. 30 rounds of quiet 9mm are a good persuader. I'm gonna file a form 1 to convert it to an SBR once the stock/922r compliance kit come out as well.
GunnitHallOfShame,35osf0,CommanderCooper,1 point,Tue May 12 21:10:08 2015 UTC,The Scorpion looks like a great gun. Perfect for a carbine option.

But then I set it down, They all stood waiting patently  watching there friends get there asses kicked by me with my fists. Each one waiting in turn only for me to beat them up.   After each guy I beat up I made a cool comment. Like the guy I tossed into the trash can, I told him I he was about to become compost. The guy who I tossed against the brick wall.

GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,MuddyWaterTeamster,-5,Tue May 5 05:47:50 2015 UTC,"It seems Everyone here thought I was asking so I could fire guns with no ear protection during target practice. Maybe you guys have been shooting lead into your water supply because I never said that. Hell, go read it again and check for yourself. I said nobody puts on hearing protection during a gunfight. So the sound of the gun can be an issue inside during the middle of the night. Bill Burr jokes about this on Conan."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,9,Sun May 3 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"You admitted to doing just that. The whole ""I fired a 38 special today out of a 357 mag (a Rossi LOL) and it destroyed my ears"" bit. If you're using a gun for defensive reasons  your hearing is going to be low on the shit you should be worrying about list. Don't get your gun advice from comedians."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-6,Sun May 3 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"I admitted to doing it yesterday.  Who hasnt done it once before?  I tried it to see what It was like so I would know if I ever had to fire a 38 to save my life (I dont know about you but I dont sleep with hearing protection on)  It matters enough to me.  Enough for me to wonder if 22lr would make for a good choice.  I had to research this and ask some questions and I ended up with realizing it would not be a good choice, but one of the questions I asked in that process was are there high capacity 22lr pistol magazines.    Then this thread ensued."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,7,Sun May 3 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Most people who aren't morons have never done it. You'd find out then and you'd have adrenaline in your system. Your test was stupid, pointless, and gave no usable information.   As mentioned elsewhere .22lr is a horrible choice if you have anything else.  You refused to accept the answer when it was spoon fed to you."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-4,Sun May 3 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"And again, not once did I refuse to accept any answer.  You and your cronies are making that up.  I accepted every singe answer I received, I didnt argue once.    I am only taking issue with how some people responded by calling me an idiot.    I seriously doubt you would treat another person this way face to face.  Bunch of keyboard warriors and internet tough guys.  If someone asked you about a 22lr high capacity mag in real life you would probably say ""nah but I wish"" or something like that.    Almost everyone I know that has fired a gun has done it at least once without hearing protection, IDK where you live."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,3,Sun May 3 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"And again, not once did I refuse to accept any answer.  You and your cronies are making that up.  I accepted every singe answer I received, I didnt argue once.     You kept asking about 10/22 mags in a handgun after we told you it only existed in the Ruger Charger and the POS ZiP 22. I was not aware I had cronies. Cool.   I am only taking issue with how some people responded by calling me an idiot.     That's because you did something stupid, and asked a very bad question based on a stupid assumption.    I seriously doubt you would treat another person this way face to face.  Bunch of keyboard warriors and internet tough guys.  If someone asked you about a 22lr high capacity mag in real life you would probably say ""nah but I wish"" or something like that.    Actually, I call morons morons in person too.  It's a common side effect of being a moron in my presence. I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm not a tough guy at all. That's basically what we said before you announced to us that you were one of the dipshits that gives the rest of us a bad name.   Almost everyone I know that has fired a gun has done it at least once without hearing protection, IDK where you live.    You need to shoot with safer people. I've lived in Texas for eight years and grew up in New Jersey. I choose not to associate with people dumb enough to not use hearing protection."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-1,Sun May 3 18:26:21 2015 UTC,Hey by the way I found a 22 pistol that can take the 10/22 mag you fucking bitch.  tec-22  So all you guys were wrong not me.  You can put a extended 22 mag in a pistol and you can suck my dick.

And it's not in the pistol grip like you wanted, for the same reasons we said.  It's also not going to be concealable, still going to be loud enough to damage your hearing, and still won't reliably stop an attacker.  So no, you're still the only one here who is wrong."

GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,-2,Mon May 18 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"You are wrong.  I never ""kept asking about 10/22 mags"" after I received an answer.  I might have asked two separate people BEFORE I recieved any asnwer, or asked for clarification from someone when the response was unclear.  Here is the thing, I was not argumentative, I was not rude, I asked a simple question and when I got the answer I was ok with it.  Then I wake up this morning and im downvoted to hell with people making fun of me calling me an idiot.    Now you are lying to cover up for being a dickhead.  Go read the thread again (I know you wont) because I was not arguing or not accepting any answer as you claim.  You are just a mean person.  Its really that simple."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,dpete10,2,Sun May 3 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"I have never fired without ears on. It is pure idiocy.   You are right though, if someone asked me about a high cap 22lr pistol I would simply say no, that would be neat but no.   If someone I were face to face with said   ""I fired a 38 special today out of a 357 mag (a Rossi LOL) and it destroyed my ears. The recoil was nothing but I was deaf after the first two rounds and ears ringing for up to an hour later. 22LR doesnt give me that probelm but I like shooting from a pistol it feels good. I think it could be used for more than just target shooting if it had a high capacity and rather than be talked out of it I am just interested if its possible.  I know everyone is going to tell me a 22 sucks as a defensive round but I dont see why 30 rounds being pumped out wouldnt do the trick considering at least one would be a headshot right? Im not going to have ear protection on when the SHTF""  I would look at them like they were an idiot, call them an idiot and tell them that they shouldn't worry about their hearing when their life is potentially at risk especially not to the point of considering a round that will endanger them.   If they responded by getting shitty for being called an idiot I would ridicule them some more for being so thin skinned."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,AMGTD,2,Sun May 3 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"I've never fired a gun without hearing protection because I know what the phrase ""permanent hearing damage"" means."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,-10,Thu May 7 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"Bunch of pretentious assholes in the gun community.  Wish someone would have told me so I would know to not ask questions here on reddit.  I guess it's only neck beards with theur moms 20 gauge because everyone in real life I've met and talked to has been very nice and liked explaining things to me about guns.    I'm young and new to weapons because I just moved down south from the north and we aren't taught or told literally anything about them where I am from, so like I said at the start if my post- I'm new and don't know much and if anyone can help thanks.  How you can respond by calling me an idiot is beyond me."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,8,Sun May 3 09:30:45 2015 UTC,"wait wait wait wait wait, you didn't know anything about guns? Like that they were loud? That you should wear earplugs instead of using a ""quieter"" gun?   i don't know dude.   People told you that in the thread but you were insisting on being an idiot rather than listening to the advice of an entire forum of experience."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-7,Sun May 3 11:28:39 2015 UTC,"Not once did I refuse or not listen to the advice you fucking cunt.  You are making shit up to be angry at me for no reason.   I asked a question about high mag 22lr pistols, I got responses that said no more than 10 usually and I said that's a shame I wish there could be high capacity 22lr pistols that weren't giant.   My god did your boyfriend not give you a reach around this morning or something?"
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,9,Sun May 3 11:49:27 2015 UTC,"remind me, what was your reason for wanting to use a high cap 22lr in the first place?"
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-5,Sun May 3 12:15:01 2015 UTC,I've read that in a fight 70-80% of shots are missed.  If I can practice a lot with cheap 22 ammo then a target 22 gun could double as a backup carry.   Not a primary maybe but I have seen that a good modern 22lr round is very much lethal.  I'm not thinking it's the best but I was just thinking it could be decent because at the end of the day the gun you are best with is the better gun.  What use is a 45 if I never get to practice with it and I suck.  I'm only ok with a 22 and that's why I asked.
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,5,Sun May 3 12:34:10 2015 UTC,"*edit: wear earplugs regardless of what you practice with.   Practicing with a 22 is completely viable, many competent pistol shooters got their start with a 22.   Do not carry a 22 as a defensive gun. I don't care about the lethality of the round at all, doesn't even factor in my decision. 22lr by design is unreliable. you will have a failure to fire eventually you are just taking your chances on whether that happens when your life depends on it not happening.   But come on man, it is written in your post. That isn't what you were claiming when you originally asked. You stated that you were seeking a quieter gun. Not for stealth but to protect your ears when firing.   THAT is why you were shamed. whether you agree, disagree listened or didn't this is why it happened.   In my experience, when ridiculed you should just hold your head up high and take it. Don't get all shitty. You field the jabs and listen to the barbs and you may just walk out of it having earned some respect from the community."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,-5,Sun May 3 12:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's legitimate to be concerned about the sound of the gun even in a defensive situation.  I only asked because even a 38 deafened me for a solid few seconds.  Imagine waking up in the middle if the night and there is someone in your house, firing your 40 inside with no time to put on hearing aides would be a lot for someone not trained in it.  I'm sure it would be disorienting as all hell especially when half asleep.  So the quiet 0 recoil 22lr would solve much if that issue except it has no stopping power, but I'm sure 10 rounds to the chest even would.  Yet we are going to kiss most of our shots which is why I asked about high capacity.    Considering 22lr causes the most injuries and maybe even deaths in the us I think it's unreliability is it's main limiting factor but I don't know shit.  A simple, no there are not high cap 22lr pistols would have sufficed.  I lift weights a lot and if someone new had asked a simple question and gotten the response I did I would be pissed.  No legitimate weight lifter would have been such a dickhead to a newbie because we all know what it was like to be new and to not know what we are doing.   This life experience breeds humility something the gun community on reddit completely lacks."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,old3nglish,8,Sun May 3 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"Even now you are fundamentally misunderstanding what is being explained to you.   Sorry but, can't help you."
GunnitHallOfShame,34o444,factorV,2,Sun May 3 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"The sound of a gun is not a legitimate concern if you need to use said gun in a defensive situation. What good is hearing going to do if your dead? I'd rather be alive and deaf than dead. There is also no excuse for ever firing any gun without hearing protection. I don't even hunt without ears on, it's just stupid. This is the reason your being called an idiot so you can stop saying that people are being assholes for no reason."

Trouble is, it's a little more expensive than is practical for a recreational round and it's not quite useful enough to be a good hunting round where I live. Deals with pests just fine. I'm also interesting in experimenting with different loads, particularly buckshot and black powder/ BP mini ball loads. Are there any good videos or websites for reloading .410? What sort of a equipment do I need to look in to? Brands? Good price points? Above all I want to be safe with this, and I'm not sure where to start. The only other rounds I would consider reloading is 8mm mauser and maybe a little 32acp if that changes anything, but that's a long ways down the road and is far from critical."

[–]whobeyou256[S] 1 point an hour ago  Technically, you cannot be under the influence of one of these substances while in possession of a firearm. It say's the same thing about alcohol, and even prescriptions. I have smoked, very heavily in the past, not so much now, but I take good care to not be under ANY influence while possessing a firearm. The law also states you cannot be ""addicted to any illegal substance"". This is a VERY grey area. It's more left up to the investigating officer. I've actually had an officer search a backpack of mine. It had marijuana in it along with my firearm (I have a concealed permit), and they let me go because I wasn't under the influence of it. http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/gun-possession-use-laws/Colorado.htm   Oh this fucking guy."

Gun rights now are as strong as they have ever been.  Before the late 1990s, very few people could carry concealed weapons.  Now, they are as cell phones in the south."

I grew up in Northern Wisconsin and I had a 410 and 22 in Grade School and I got my 243 in 6th grade and my 12 gage in eighth grade.  Nobody in Wisconsin or in the Navy is as irrational about guns as the people on here.  I honestly don't know why you feel it is your interest to deny the existence of infrared scopes and guns that are more deadly than fully automatic guns or that their are microprocessor controlled sniper sights.  he technology is out there it isn't logical to deny its existence and for the life of me I don't know why you want to.  Go guys are funny, but I guess banning anyone with a different point of view prevents you from having to think.  It is sad but it helps me understand your personalities, but I do doubt that many of you would have the ability pass a gun safety course.  Even when I was a kid, at the back of all the gun and mercenary magazines they had adds for guns that could be converted to fully automatic."

GunnitHallOfShame,2zjrx4,Sasasquatch,13,Thu Mar 19 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno;  it's one thing to carry concealed on your person despite ""no guns"" policies on a corporate campus.  Concealed is concealed, and it's attached to your hip.  But to walk around with an SBR in a fucking briefcase while performing sys-admin duties among strangers in an office setting?  Come on...  This dude really comes off as having an action-hero complex.  Plus, off-person carry in environments with people is retarded.  I don't care how responsible or careful you are, when moving around day to day with a briefcase, you will eventually leave it somewhere unintentionally.    Working on your own campus and keeping a rig like that somewhere discrete is an entirely different matter; much like /u/porttack's example of a business with a gunsafe that everyone knew about."

Personally, i would have packed my stuff, called the cops and waited out front to greet and escort them over to those two idiots. Brandishing/assault with a deadly weapon is no joke. Im assuming he  never actually muzzled them and rather they where just parallel   somewhere else down the range. Drawing was just not the solution there. Wtf where they gonna do, fire back? Pretty  sure that would cause a terrible chain of events to follow."
GunnitHallOfShame,2z77vq,Calibased,2,Mon Mar 16 06:41:27 2015 UTC,I don't see anywhere where he says he's going to start blatting back towards the firing line. Looks like he's just taking about finding cover and assessing the situation. It's better to have the gun in your hand and not need it than the other way around. That's pretty much what /r/guns preaches all day.  Edit: Context is key. There's nothing wrong with having your gun in your hand in this situation. Pointing it at someone as your first action instead of shouting for cease fire is where you leave sensible country and it becomes a CCW wet dream.
GunnitHallOfShame,2z77vq,LP_Sh33p,10,Mon Mar 16 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is why I don't bother with a holster. I just carry my gun in my hand all day in case I need it. I leave my finger on the trigger where it belongs too, so I don't have to waste time."

Cover seems like a great fucking idea, but would your shooter be considered escalating the conflict, or would you for drawing your weapon? I'd hope the courts would side with you.   On October 5, 1985, Platt and Matix murdered 25-year-old Emelio Briel while he was target shooting at a rock pit. The pair stole Briel's car and used it to commit several robberies. Briel's remains were found on March 1, 1986 but were not positively identified until May 1986.                      On March 12, 1986, Platt and Matix robbed and shot Jose Collazo while Collazo was target shooting at a rock pit. The pair left Collazo for dead and stole his car, a black 1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

Once you are getting shot at, you are no longer intelligent. You are no longer reasonable, you are in FF or F.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect someone getting shot at, to run and get behind cover and be prepared to fight.  I do not understand why that would be an overreaction.  You are down range of fire.  We do not know OPs layout of his range, we do not know anything in this situation.  We only know what shitty fragmented story we got, and my view is mine.    I FULLY and often admit to being wrong, however I am NOT wrong here.  Being wrong means you learned something new, that is fantastic.  Learning is how we evolve.  However you may think I am wrong, but plenty of people do not think the same way.  People do not fully take the time to read or understand just what is said, and choose to be high and mighty with armchair Monday morning quarterbacking."
