40kLore,3e11nq,El_Capitano_MC,38,Tue Jul 21 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, I saw this and couldn't wait to get home and reply!  There are many different factors that come into account here. Firstly, I'll start with the life of a Guardsman.  Once you're deployed you have very little information about what's going on. You'll probably know who you're fighting and that'll be about it. You won't have any clue about the landscape (unless you're local or higher up in the chain of command), why you're here (to kill The Emperor's foes of course!), or anything overly important really. You're one soldier in a one million strong gunline. Your life does not matter. You are personally the cheapest and most expendable resource that the Imperium has on offer. You will die and you will not be missed. As for the exact numbers, I don't quite recall the source but it's usually less than 12 hours. The initial charge / establishment of beachhead is normally the most costly. The Astra Militarum HERESY *BLAM*** Imperial Guard are known as the Hammer of The Emperor. This is not because of the mighty thought that goes into an invasion. This is because a commander is given an order, for example, take x planet from y xenos because z. This is where us human are fuck tards. Almost every commander and his retinue fail to employ tactics that don't resemble ""Hey fiddle diddle, right up the middle."" This leads to commanders throwing resources (lives and cheap lasguns) at a problem until it goes away. These problems tend to be very heavily fortifies areas. Almost hilariously, many soldiers who survive a single battle are dubbed as veterans.  Hopefully this paints a picture of bleak, shitty, grimdark FUN, HOLY, ENJOYMENT that are on offer as a Guardsman.  Now, Space Marines.  I believe there was mention extra magical bonus points for differentiating between chapters?   Space Marine casualties (fluff wise) depend on many things... The scale of the war, who is fighting, why they are fighting, and who they are fighting.  If the battle is just the apocalypse made incarnate (like the wars for Armageddon), then Space Marines will push up daisies just as quickly as a Guardsman. It's no use having armour that can withstand a thousand shots if there's millions of orks with machine guns for each marine. In those wars entire Chapters were defeated and destroyed.  If the Space Marines are defending they will shore up defences, try to set up kill zones, have places to fall back to, but most of all I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE actually use something that resembles tactics.  Space Marines are called the Scalpel (Sword would have been cooler) of the Emperor. Another orky example. If the Space Marines know the location of the Warboss leading a WAAARGH! then they may choose to deploy drop pods and simply eliminate the leader, with may cost some marines but will ultimately end the war (temporarily at the very least).   After this it comes down to wargear and supplies. In several stories (Istavaan in HH for example) Marines last months against their foes despite being outnumbered and outgunned. Space Marine lives are held in high regard as they not only carry the gene seed of their chapter but holy wargear that served the chapter for generations. Power Armour is described as being able to shrug of fire that would cripple a small tank. And there is an army that wears this armour. Don't get me started on fluffy Terminator Armour. Just think of a walking tank wearing only slightly vulnerable plot armour.  The next thing to consider is the specific chapter. Since I myself am a filthy magpie, I will use the Blood Ravens as the first example. Instead of striking first STEHL REHN and setting up a beachhead, they would rather see how the enemy moves, analyse their potential plan, and then strike quickly to either eliminate commanders or to deny objectives / relics (that we didn't steal I swear). The Ultramarines would rather strike and set up their own base of operations, and then formulate their main plan of action, which may cost more marine lives.   I'm not saying that one is better than the other. Which is better is entirely situational. I doubt the Blood Ravens would have handled Damnos quite as well. Not to mention that the Smurfs have a much larger recruiting pool, so they can afford casualties to a higher degree than some other chapters. It's all situational.  The Salamanders try to protect civilians wherever possible, and as such will sometimes be in the line of fire.   Then there are chapters like the Blood Angels that suffer from The Thirst and The Black Rage and are susceptible to a premature rage induced death. So that's... um... nice.... I guess.... There are many things that will affect how a chapter deploys and conducts itself. I'm not going to go through each chapter as I have no idea how many there are exactly (approx. 1000), but you should get the idea.   Guardsman are lucky to survive their first day of deployment, a Space Marine's life entirely depends on the situation and who they are."

I figured Guardsmen would die quickly, but damn fuck that. How the hell would any of them ever get promoted? or would they have to come from a higher up family/ social status to skip the front line infantry stage.

40kLore,3e11nq,bjorn_ex_machina,11,Tue Jul 21 05:04:51 2015 UTC,"There is a book called Fifteen Hours that chronicles the deployment of new recruits into an active warzone with the Orks. Title because, you guessed it, 15 hour life expectancy.  Like the marines IG vary wildly across world and regiment, some commanders are competent, even great, while other are of the aforementioned CHARGE!!!! variety. For example, Catachans specialize in stealth, guerrilla tactics, and death world survival.   It all varies, but in general a guardsman is far squishier than a Marine, not only because of the armor but also the massive genetic enhancements that let them recover from being blown to bits. (exaggeration, but not much)  Space Marine tactics also vary wildly, if you are looking into them for the first time the First Founding chapters are a good place to start. http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Space_Marine_Legion  Some of my personal favorites are the Mantis Warriors, Excoriators, Raven Guard, Soul Drinkers, and Space Wolves.

The black templars lent some apothecaries to them for a while.  Generally though the most common scenario is when a new chapter is started- they need space marines somewhere.

For example:  Ultramarines -> Chapter X -> Chapter Y  Chapter X gets killed down to a few dozen men and since the gene-seed tithes are NEVER USED TO REPLENISH THE RANKS, they become part of Chapter Y, maybe forming a kind of honour guard.  Additionally, there are some versions of things where, when a new chapter is made, the founding chapter sends a handful of brothers to go and guide and teach and they can eventually just stay they forever. So a detachment of Ultramarines would become the founding, experience core of Chapter X."

Enginseers tend to not have a specific discipline outside of the maintenance of standard Imperial equipment, which makes them low-level members of the Mechanicus ideal to be placed on a planet or Imperial Guard regiment to do whatever needs to be done/preach the Gospel of the Machine-God.   Magos are higher members of the Priesthood that almost always separated from ""fleshy"" life and have a specific area of research or study. Because the Cult Mechanicus believes a person's value lies exclusively in the sum of his knowledge, a Magos is of a higher rank than an Enginseer.  A good example is Magos Felicia Tayber. When she was young, she was basically halted at Enginseer and looked down on by her superiors because she (in their eyes) was too closely tied to the flesh. It wasn't until her experience with Ork technology that she was elevated to Magos and given her own research facility to study a Xeno artifact."

If your average, non-Mechanicus human meets a member of the Mechanicus, they probably met an Enginseer.  Enginseers are technically members of the Priesthood and regular humans (especially Guardsmen) refer to them as ""Techpriests"", but the Mechanicus considers them to be very low level members. Kind of like the difference between a Menial and a true Adept. They're on the track."

IMO it's a pretty cool take on things, rarely people would think of 40k as a prequel to Fantasy.  EDIT: Found quote Terminator Armour and the following:  So all of the new, fancy-looking armor you see today is actually crappier than the goofy old armor. That's mostly how stuff works in 40K, technology actually gets worse as time moves on so we won't be surprised if by 51st millennium, everything reverts back/progresses to Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Considering the apocalyptic devastation happening on every battle field to every faction...that actually is plausible-hey wait a minute!

Sigmar was just a talented and wise warlord whose superhuman feats start to happen only after he received Ghal-Maraz from the dwarves. Also, he didn't fly to heaven  ""which was in truth, a dropship"" like I saw in some theory somewhere on the web. Sigmar didn't actually ascend to heavens, he just left and went east after ruling the Empire for 50 years. Information about him becoming a god comes from a priest of Ulric who claimed he had a vision of Ulric putting a crown on Sigmar's head.  I know it is an old theory and can easily be seen as cool and neat explanation of somethings, but there is literally nothing supporting it and a lot disproving it."
40kLore,3dpo97,t0xicd0g,15,Tue Jul 21 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"It's always been left somewhat ambiguous; in the early days of the Warhammer world the Old Slann (who correlate with the Old Ones of 40k mythos) created the warp gates above the poles of the world through which they could travel between worlds. Then some cataclysm happened, the (presumably) webway gates collapsed and chaos protruded through into the real world like a sort of dimensional prolapse. This correlates to the disaster that destroyed the Old Ones civilisation in 40k - after breeding races of psychically powerful creatures to fight their wars against the Necrons (Eldar, humans, Orks) the warp turned from being a calm place to a roiling, terrible thing full of fragments of sentience and emotion, and when the Chaos Gods were born, the warp convulsed and crushed most of the webway, and huge warp storms erupted.   It's always been implied in the fluff that they inhabit the same universe, especially in recent years where a bunch of Elves who entered the Realm of Chaos almost certainly encountered the current Grand Master of the Grey Knights in one of the End Times books."

40kLore,3dpo97,t0xicd0g,3,Sun Jul 19 00:51:47 2015 UTC,Just seeded; the Eldar and Krork were engineered front line troops and sorceror-warriors that they desperately needed at that point in time; the seeding was the long-term goal to fill the galaxy with psychically attuned species that would be the bane of the Necrons. Sadly it also proved the undoing of the Warp...

At one point he's impaled protecting the Warhammer fantasy team in an escape attempt and he's left behind, a mage consoles the leader of the party that ""Chaos can never truly kill him"".  The Skaven also possibly make contact with the 40k universe during their assault on the jungles of Lustria in their attempt to finish off the Lizardmen, they break in to a temple and find a device they call a Farsqueaker, use it and make contact with ""a strange, alien Elf like race"" before freaking out and blowing it up. The Lizardmen have always been the most ancient race in Warhammer Fantasy and have the most contact with the ones they called the ""Old Ones"", and it's suggested that the Skaven accidently contacted the Craftworld Eldar while fiddling about with their machines."

Technically every Dark Angel Legionary that was on Caliban when Luther decided to have a go at self-governance is considered Fallen regardless of their loyalties or beliefs.  That means some Fallen are very much loyal to the Emperor and just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time while others were tricked into a more active role in the treachery and a select few actively chose to go against the Imperium and the Lion. Don't listen to the whole ""The Lion was a traitor blah blah blah"", it's just a fun little narrative have created to mess with your head.

Psykers who are too weak to work for the Imperium are brought there to have what powers they do have siphoned. The Emperor certainly guides it, even from across the Galaxy, but he doesn't actually create it himself. Big E during modern day Warhammer is sitting on the throne keeping the webway shut, not powering the Astronomicon.  And as far as referencing the Throne, he IS The Emperor. He certainly has a big fancy chair somewhere, although they aren't referencing The Golden Throne as we know it."
40kLore,3dmqi3,Isak922,8,Fri Jul 17 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"Sitting on the throne to keep the webway shut?   That can't be right, the webway got f'd when Magnus came through but that was long before big E was sitting on it.  Have you got a source for it?"
40kLore,3dmqi3,Lovely_Comment,9,Fri Jul 17 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"Post-Thousand Sons, several books feature The Emperor having manned the Throne at this point. The only time he removed himself was to fight Horus. He can mentally project himself, psychically posses people, and (for short moments) leave the Throne... But after Magnus, he is definitely fighting to keep the Webway shut as his primary focus. I'm away from books right now, but I can see about digging out examples later.  If you're asking about BEFORE Magnus, he had been overseeing the construction and efforts since after Ullanor. He would have been in the Webway, working with it, and possibly attuning the Throne to Himself or Magnus."
40kLore,3dmqi3,Isak922,4,Fri Jul 17 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he meant keeping the warp shut. Like, the daemon gods are constantly trying to open a portal to the warp on Terra because well, duh, but the Emperor is fighting a constant psychic battle to stop them."
40kLore,3dmqi3,tantan628,4,Fri Jul 17 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"no the golden throne was a portal to the human webway, this was the Emp's big plan and why he bailed.  Magnus ripped open the webway to the warp, basically under the Throne is a huge never ending war between Humanity and the Warp."

40kLore,3dmqi3,MaximumHeresy,2,Sun Jul 19 07:00:05 2015 UTC,"The human webway exploded and was replaced with a hole into the warp. Think of the human webway as a tunnel through the warp which was held sealed from the warp with technologies and psychic energy. Magnus destroyed all that, so the tunnel collapsed, leaving a gaping hole into the warp. This hole is like a mini Eye of Terror (Eye of Terra, haha, clever GW).  Presumably, the Golden Throne was intended to allow Magnus or the Emperor to power the human webway, and/or was a tool used by the Emperor to establish the warp tunnel in the first place. Since the tunnel was busted, it just allows a powerful psyker to keep the warp tunnel closed.  As soon as Magnus blew up all the shit, the Emperor had to sit on the Throne or else demons would invade Terra. Malcador died after replacing him for just a little while so he could kill Horus. Then the Emperor went right back on, now too weak to fix the hole."
40kLore,3dmqi3,MaximumHeresy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:05:51 2015 UTC,Just to expand a little because /u/Lovely_Comment was asking for it. The source for this is The Horus Heresy Collected Visions published by Black Library.
40kLore,3dmqi3,TheStradivarius,5,Mon Jul 20 11:09:10 2015 UTC,"Magnus came through during the near-end of the Heresy, before the Siege of Terra.  At that point Empy was stuck holding the webway shut solo (on a pre-life support golden throne) while the traitors attacked Terra, leaving only to attack Horus. Malcador the Sigilite is killed trying to hold it shut while the Emperor is gone.  This is why the Emperor isn't more active in stopping the traitors. He's too busy trying to keep a warpstorm from engulfing Terra thanks to Magnus' idiocy."
40kLore,3dlj5t,El_Capitano_MC,26,Fri Jul 17 06:27:09 2015 UTC,"Fucked beyond measure.  Immediate effects: Legions of daemons and warp spawn overrun Terra, since he is psychically single-handedly holding back scores of monsters from exiting the breach in the Webway.  Then the Astronomicon shuts down, making Warp Travel exponentially harder. Many ships in transit are lost immediately. Warp storms start up everywhere. Warp travel is still possible, but much, much more dangerous. Most voyages and military campaigns are cut short and destroyed, while entire worlds and systems are cut off from each other. Interstellar everything now becomes a nightmare. Xenos and heretics close in on all sides and begin to pick off individual worlds, slowly but surely. Hive worlds are torn apart as their massive populations can no longer be supported. Any hope of stopping the Tyranids evaporates, and massive Ork WAAAAGH!s engulf entire undefended sectors.   The only worlds that probably do okay are Agri Worlds, Forge Worlds, and planets that don't rely heavily on import or export and have decent defenses. Systems band together to survive, while Guardsmen, Marines, Sororitas, Inquisition, and Navy elements do their best to defend the small patches they can. Many civil wars break out, especially if knowledge of the Emperor's death leaks out. The Ecclisiarchy tears itself apart, as does the Inquisition, and Space Marine Chapters are forced to take sides. Countless citizens and worlds take this chance rebel. Humanity is more or less doomed.  And the worst part is that there aren't any psykers around who are powerful enough to handle the pressure. The Emperor's best friend, Malcador the Sigillite, an extremely powerful psyker in his own right, disintegrated after just a few hours on the Throne.  In short, mankind is beyond fucked."
40kLore,3dlj5t,H-K_47,10,Fri Jul 17 06:46:03 2015 UTC,And if the Emperor turning into a new godlike warp entity or the rebirth theory is true?
40kLore,3dlj5t,Remigus,8,Fri Jul 17 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm. . . that depends on how exactly it happens. If he is reborn, then Terra is still doomed and the Imperium still collapses, since it'll take some time for him to become an adult once more remaster his abilities. If he becomes a new godlike warp entity, it could mean any number of things. He could simply become another Chaos God, one of Order. There's actually a very interesting fanfiction called ""Warhammer 50K: The Shape of the Nightmare to Come"" that may interest you. If he remains benevolent, then that could be a very good thing indeed for humanity. He could give more power to his followers, and Chaos would stop making jokes about him being a corpse. He'd still need to power the Astronomicon and hold off the Webway daemons, but it would definitely lend a lot more credibility to the Eccleisiarchy. He might even be able to make some more direct changes to the Imperium and communicate with the Council of Terra. Things could improve significantly."
40kLore,3dlj5t,H-K_47,7,Fri Jul 17 07:03:59 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look into that story you mentioned, I'm all for speculative fiction within 40k. 8D  Personally, I'm greatly fond of the notion of him becoming a warp entity, both for the irony of him ending up actually becoming the very thing he insisted he wasn't for so long, and for the fact that we could finally see him interact directly with the Imperium again. Though, I suspect him becoming a new warp God (I won't say Chaos God given the whole Order stict I'm sure he'd have) could cause some divides in the Imperium, particularly if he tries to lead humanity further on the path of becoming a fully psychic race. I'd also wager there would definitely be some friction with the Primarchs that would come out of the woodwork, both loyalists denying his God like status and perhaps even traitors coming to him for forgiveness after their repeated failure to crush the Imperium under Chaos God direction.   If he came back however as a strict embodiment of Order, then that would definitely be bad for the Imperium, and I'd wager everyone else as well.   As for rebirth into a human form, assuming he doesn't get killed and retains his knowledge and power, I could see him potentially reuniting the remnants of humanity, though I suspect civil war between him and Primarchs or factions who have either lost faith or don't belive him to be the Emperor reborn. Between the Nids, Chaos, and Orks he'd have his hands full. But if he's on world where he doesn't have to spend all his will keeping a warp breach shut, he may be able to rise back to power."

Undoubtedly some of the weaker ones would turn traitor. Several might try to carve out mini-kingdoms from the wreckage, like Ultramar. Many might become marauding pirates, ransacking systems. Chapters such as the Salamanders would do their best to defend humanity, however.  The overall fallout would be arguably much more devastating than the Horus Heresy, however.

It's confirmed in the Apocalypse Novel, Pandorax (I think that's the one anyway) that during the Horus Heresy, the initial Marines that made up the Grey Knights had their gene-seed removed, and had the 'Grey Knight Gene Seed' implanted.   In 'The Emperor's Gift' by ADB, it's confirmed that The Emperor's Gift (Grey Knight gene-seed) is Emperor-derived gene-seed.   Having The Emperor's gene-seed ticking away at your DNA would probably be the explanation here, more than likely stimulating the natural psyker abilities found in base-line mankind (mankind is a psychic species, just not well evolved)."

40kLore,3dd3we,Judgethunder,46,Wed Jul 15 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"Honored lords and ladies, my enlightened peers who have called me to this trial in front of our esteemed conclave. We have heard your condemnations of my studies, your decrying of my methods, and the moral judgements you seek to levy against me.  Now, in the minutes before my assured end, do me the small honor of hearing my words.  You accuse me of consorting with the enemy, when I simply made our enemy fight itself. You accuse me of seeking forbidden knowledge, when I simply seek our enemy's weakness. You accuse me of sacrificing those we are meant to protect, when you and I all know that the ends justify the means.  Before you judge me by your selective morals, let me show you who you are forgetting.  When Inquisitor Thelemann redirected the Ork-infested Space Hulk Wound of the Stars towards the Kruul Dominion, so that the greenskins would fight each other - was he put on trial? No. The fact that he sacrificed twelve vessels of our already endangered Battlefleet to do so, or that two Imperial worlds fell in the Wound's wake hardly even warranted a mention in these gilded halls. Hundreds of thousands of voidsmen dead, irreplacable warships lost, billions of citizens massacred by the Orks. He sits there, at the third row from the top, attending my trial.  When Inquisitrix Narveste bargained with the Cabal of the Weeping Spirit to exterminate the Craftworld Iyanden scouts within the Queron Range, not a single one of you questioned her methods. Nor did you question her methods when the trap meant to kill the Caballites failed, and they went on to abduct six thousand men, women, and children throughout our sector. They still rampage through our domain, invited by our esteemed peer. She sits there, at the front row, attending my trial.  When Lord-Inquisitor Palainostor emptied the witch-vaults of this very world, to throw those unsanctioned living weapons against the deluge of the Hive Fleet, only three - THREE of his fellows in the Ordos Hereticus and Malleus questioned his methods. Not a one of them is here today. Each one of them fell - in the twisted and warped scars you can still see outside those windows - trying to contain the unleashed mutants when they turned against us. I don't need to tell you where Lord Palainostor stands in this moment. He's just so many steps from my face that I can't quite spit at his.  So what do you accuse me of?   You say I consorted with the followers of the Changer of Ways? Of course I did! I learned their ways, their rites, their speech - so that I could take control of the Cult of the Golden Claw and drive them to ritual suicide. Nine hundred cultists, dead by their own hands. Yes - I now bear the marks of the enemy on my skin, and that frightens you - but know that it permits me to move unseen among them, as an Inquisitor should.  You say I'm a Daemonologist? Of course I am! I learned the true names of the Blood God's hounds and executioners, and I bound them to my service. Then I threw them against their old masters and watched as the army of twelve thousand poised to invade Arrach Prime consumed itself. I filled the lake of the Basalt Basin with Khornate blood without firing a shot! Did summoning those beasts require sacrifice? Of course it did! But not a single man had to march against that army, no Guardsman had to give his life for the sake of tradition.  You say I'm a traitor? Because I took Aron-Deimos, a world that had already fallen to rebellion and turned it into a four-way conflict between the armies of Chaos? If taking the armies of our enemies and turning them against each other makes me a traitor, then a traitor I am and forever will be!  The nature of Chaos will always be to fight itself! That is its true weakness! It is our Holy Duty to press on that weakness until our enemies fold in on themselves and destroy each other!  Execute me now if you will.  I know that I have done nothing but the Emperor's work, and that I shall stand at His side in the life after this.  I have nothing more to leave you with but your own thoughts."
40kLore,3dd3we,palinola,12,Wed Jul 15 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Your highness, the Inquisitor has done an excellent job laying out the facts of this trial, and of demonstrating the lure of the Arch-enemy. He has also done an excellent job explaining just how dangerous men like him are. He has supported insurrection, abused the privileges of his rank, and consorted with daemons.  He says he does this to protect us, to turn our enemies against each other.  He cites the examples of our fellow Inquisitors as they purged the influence of xenos from across the sector.  However, the they defendant fails to recognize is the great danger the Arch-Enemy poses to us all.  The Orks, the Eldar, the Tyranid, all these foul species pale in comparison to mankind.  They are so lost as to have never even known the light of the Emperor.  But the Arch-Enemy, our greatest enemy, is also the most insidious.  Those heretics, and the Ruinous Powers which control them, once knew the Emperor's love and bathed in the glory of the Imperium.  But rather than follow as a true son of the Emperor, they instead turned their back on everything we hold sacred.  They abandoned the Imperial Truth in exchange for the promise of glory, power, and immortality.   That is the great danger of the Ruinous Powers.  Heretics are not unfeeling aliens, deranged xenos bent only on humanity's destruction.  They were once us, but became corrupted and twisted by dark promises. While the Emperor built his holy Throne on Terra,  his sons became tainted and turned against their God-Father. That is the true danger.  Even the Emperor's Angels of Death, the greatest bulwark humanity has, the legendary Space Marines, can be laid low by the slightest taint of Chaos.   This is why we must remain so pure, why the Ordo Malleus must work so hard to preserve the purity of the Imperium's subjects, and ourselves. Because even knowledge gained with the purest intention and used in the holiest of causes can still taint the soul.  And their is no weapon which can substitute for righteous hatred and zeal.   There is the famous saying, ""An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded."" Do your duty, condemn the defendant as the heretic he is, strip him of his rank, and turn him over to Chaplain Zimeon.  Only then can we be safe from his subtle corruption.  Remember today's daily devotion:   Cast out the mutant, the traitor, the heretic. For every enemy without there are a hundred within."

40kLore,3dd3we,palinola,4,Thu Jul 16 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"Petty minded fool! You cannot comprehend the magnitude of the task I have undertaken or the consequence of my failure!   Quotes aside Xanthism is an necessary evil. I have always seen it as one of the underlying fabrics of the Ordo Malleus. It's the same reason why in our world using indigenous weapons and ammo is easier than the tricked out SOPMOD. There's an abundance of ammunition, you blend in better and it usually works better. Puritanism can only get so far while serving the Inquisition. An Monodominant leading an planet wide pogrom with bitchin' hats, pyres and zealotry may cull a few psykers, mutants and the like but how many slip through the shadows in the ensuing chaos? Of course there is a time and place for it but what knowledge is lost when a Libricar executes an Xanthite without even considering the implications or tools that are forever wasted? Phaenonites seem far more dangerous as they have completely turned their back on the Imperium. Libricars and Monodominants are too close minded to do what is necessary. This though is one of the greatest strengths of the Ordos. That very eclectic nature is their greatest strength. It would be so much easier for the enemies of mankind to adapt if all Inquisitors were bitchin' hat wearing zealots who announce their arrival on a planet weeks in advance to scare the populace.  Xanthites work in the shadows where they belong. They hunt the most dangerous foe the Inquisition knows in the very places where most men would never step foot less damn themselves forever. (You can argue that the Hereticus has the more righteous duty as they police mankind as a whole. Men are capable of things more despicable than demons. It's in the demons nature to do what it does. It's meant to hate, consume, manipulate and perverse. At one point, regardless of how terrible the things they've done, that person was an man or woman with dreams, fears and could have easily been one of us. It's not a surprise when the demon does what it does.)  I can definitely sympathize with Xanthites. I've seen good guys in my line of work do what they thought was necessary to get the job done just so that they can get home at the end of their shift. Some criticize them for it and if you took someone from the outside for instance, they would be appalled and disappointed, seeking censure and righteous justice, because how dare someone bend the law. But I can respect the strength it requires to sacrifice like that and risk everything.   Do you know the strength it requires to walk in the very places angels fear to tread? To spend years around the very thing that damns, corrupts and destroys? To fight the very essence of hell and it's minions knowing that for every victory your soul is that more damned? To see fools who would unknowingly doom an entire sector, billions of people, because of their self righteousness?   What about seeing the men and women who have accompanied you for years, your closest agents, who could also possibly be your friends, damned because of the necessary evil that is our duty? All the unknowing innocents you've led to an death far worse than a bolt round all because of an ideal?  At the end of the day Xanthism is and always will be an a part of the Malleus. It's ancient. Phaenonites may be some of the most despicable radicals to ever grace the Inquisition but they will come and go. Horusians may grow through the years but Xanthism will always exist. For every righteous daemonhunter proclaiming their own purity, there is a Xanthite. It's human nature to be an Xanthite but it's a very thin line to tread. Our weapons and faith can only do so much against the foe from beyond. The warp itself is a reflection of humanity. Our perceptions of morality mean nothing in the grand scheme of things but the only way we can possibly combat Chaos and the warp is through their own means. If that wasn't the case wouldn't the Astartes have already won? Wouldn't the Imperium usher in a new era? What if the people of the Imperium knew that the warp is just an reflection of their own base emotions and desires?"
40kLore,3dd3we,speakthetrewf,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Inquisitors and other elements of humanity will always try and work outside of the standard order of the Imperium. Heck, on a broader scale you have to consider how many Hereteks must exist in the Mechanicus to get an idea of how the idea of using Chaos is so subversive and, dare I say, common.  For the Inquisition specifically, Xanthism stems from the greater contradiction of the Imperium ie. psykers are used as one of the fundamental parts of humanity's Imperium. Psykers and the Warp are crucial to humanity's survival and some Inquisitors choose to use far more elements of the Warp to combat Chaos. That is the start of the slippery slope into Xanthism.  However, I always find it interesting how Xanthism can bleed into other sects of the Inquisition. Thorian and Xanthite thought has given rise to research into the zombie plague of Nurgle and how it could be applied to the Golden Throne. That level of dabbling in the Warp shows how the Inquisition has become, in a sense, desperate to use anything and everything to protect humanity.  And finally, I always liked the quote: ""An Inquisitor begins as a Puritan but ends as a Radical."" Xanthism is just one part of Radical thought but all are weapons to be wielded against the enemies of Man."
40kLore,3dd3we,leakycauldron,5,Wed Jul 15 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"As our good friend Nicolo Machiavelli said: ""The ends justify the means.""  Admittedly, I am pro Chaos and live to see the destruction of the Imperium, however it must be noted that Chaos is unparalled power. The only way the Emprah could defeat Horus was because Sanguinius created the tiniest chink in Horus' armour. If this hadn't happened, big E would have been rekt.  The Inquisition know no bounds. They have no rules to play by. All that matters is protecting the Imperium.  What's better? Sacrifice a world to Khorne and summon a host of blood crazed daemons to stall a Black Crusade in order to give time for reinforcments to arrive, or to defend the world, have it slaughtered and still have it sacrificed to Khorne, except now the champions gain daemonic gifts.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few in the Imperium."
40kLore,3dd3we,Blyd,5,Wed Jul 15 11:55:14 2015 UTC,"I believe you are mixing things up, unless the current canon has changed.

The varying accounts is who distracted Horus for the Emperor to deal the killing blow - an Imperial Fists Terminator or Ollanius Pius."

Onto the rumor:  Well, because Janus was an Egyptian god with 2 faces (or personalities, I can't remember), it's said that Loken/Cerberus is Janus.  If you remember, in Legion of One, Loken is found alive, but broken and very much insane, much like Primarch Vulkan when he decides that he is, in fact, immune to all forms of fire, to include atmospheric re-entry, and was proven wrong. We all (most/some pick whichever you like) know what happened to Vulkan's mind when he came back, and the same pretty much happened to Loken.  He called himself Cerberus because he couldn't die no matter what he tried (possible Nurgle wouldn't allow it? Istvaan was seemingly under Nurgle's control at this point, but this is only my own personal speculation, and even I don't believe it). So he decides he must be the gate keeper of hell, and kills pretty much everyone and everything around him.  Garro and his group (2 others at this point I think, a World Eater and a psyker, can't remember the Legion) show up, Garro and Loken basically 1-on-1 each other to a standstill, Garro drops his guard and Loken suddenly remembers everything. Because Space Marines obviously run on love like that. Fuck the fact psyker that was going to be one of the first Grey fucking Knights, he wasn't strong enough. Horrible ending to a great book.  Bonus funny story about this book, my friend knew my fave character was Loken, so he hid from me the fact that Loken actually survived for about 2 years. When I finally found this book my jaw dropped, called him up excited as hell, and yeah, he knew, and told me his plan. I drove over to his house and decked him."
40kLore,3dc8e4,OzarkaDew,18,Wed Jul 15 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with /u/fog1234 here, the crunchy commissar executing people for cowardice and being more frightening than a hive tyrant bearing down on you are a bit ridiculous.   This is why in most of the novels and much of the fluff this type of of commissar tend to have ""accidents"" real quick, and the Catachans are even kind of famous for them ""disappearing"".   Two of the most famous Commissars in the fluff are Gaunt and Cain. If am not sure that Gaunt has actually executed anyone, and he is actually acting commander of a regiment; and Cain tends to have the men and officers of the regiments are actually protective of him because he seems to actually care about them, even though he claims it is out of self interest. He even goes on to train cadets.   This seems to be one of those things where while they have very broad powers, they tend to be more political oversight or investigative officers outside of the chain of command for if soldiers royally fuck up, rather than some ominous spectre of death and fear on the battlefield. In the end they are just dudes with a pistol and a sword, in the middle of a bunch of dudes with rifles. Fear tactics wouldnt be effective really except against conscripts, convicts, or fresh recruits.   However, the fame level commissars are few and far between, I forgot Yarrick so that is three, so when some aspect of the lore is just a bit too ridiculous I usually just write it off as propaganda."

Historically, Stalin's commissars and other nations political officers tended be horrific failures in the field and fouled up many operations. Additionally, real 'blocking detachments' were nothing like their portrayal in 'Enemy at the Gates'.    In 40k the commissar is a brightly dressed target in a sea of men who look different, often seen barking out orders, and the first over the top.  They would last seconds on the battlefield.  The summary execution of officers would also likely not contain a rout.  This is why no modern armies employ this tactic.  Commissars are pure nonsense written for twelve year old boys.  What holds guard regiments together are the non-commissioned officers who speak the native language and know what they are doing.  These are your heros.  The commissar is effectively an adviser/cheerleader who explains patiently to feral world NCO's what time the artillery is going to let up, how to prevent trench foot, and helps with discipline."

40kLore,3d0irk,kumadown,3,Sun Jul 12 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"But the warp, to a limited degree, takes the shape that one with strong will can give it. On the other hand if being does not have strong warp presence or emotion it could, in theory, be unaffected or ignored by inhabitants of the warp. It could actually get either way, depending on tyranid. Synaptic ones, or genestealer in the warp could just as well get a massive boost, like the ones who absorbed a lot of Ork DNA after Kryptman's attempt to make them fight each-other. IMO they are likely to perish, but mentioned 'psychic' tyranids could have some intriguing consequences.  EDIT: Maybe to clarify, I have been looking at it from this angle ""what if tyranid could believe strongly enough that there must be biomass, that it would become true in a limited area?""."

Hunger/devouring for purely survival doesn't empower her much hence why the average Imperial citizen who is half  starved doesn't nessecarily fall to chaos because of their obsession with ""the next meal"" (and indeed is arguably protected from the effects of overindulgence).  Plus Tyranids are meant to be like antimatter to the warp's matter, right? They block it out so I doubt even She Who Must Be Obeyed could be empowered by them."
40kLore,3d0irk,Dutch_Calhoun,4,Mon Jul 13 09:51:53 2015 UTC,"Very good point. It seems apparent that Chaos is empowered only by drives within the higher forms of consciousness. Khorne draws no power from the warring of two ant hives, Tzeench draws nothing from birds striving to build nests, etc.   So even though the Tyranids are an overwhelmingly vast biomass, and the Hive Mind can exhibit an astonishing degree of emergent intellect, they are still individually animals whose mental existence doesn't even wobble the needle as far as Chaos is concerned."
40kLore,3d0irk,Bridgeru,3,Mon Jul 13 13:41:16 2015 UTC,"Chaos is emotion after all. The excess of rage/suffering/pleasure/imagination that go beyond mere existence. Ironically its what poets said ""makes us human"" empowers our doom. IMO the reason the Tyranids don't 'wobble the needle' is because of their purely animalistic instinct. Also necrons are the opposite IMO being emotional but so inorganic they don't produce a psychic ""ripple"" of that emotion.   I see Chaos, Tyranids and Necrons as a rock paper sicsors affair (or water/grass/fire). A trio that may end up balancing, and being balanced by, the other two."
40kLore,3d0irk,pseud0nym,2,Mon Jul 13 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"Well.. as the warp represents Chaos and instability and the Tyranids represent the ultimate in order: probably nothing. As for the Hive mind.. pretty sure it is equal to the great powers of the warp on its own. After all, there is an entire galaxy out there (maybe more) that is entirely overrun with Tyranids. That is a lot of grey matter to utilize. More than exists in all the known alien races in the 40K universe combined."

It actively suppresses the warp around synapse creatures and creates a massive warp shadow around hive fleets.  One of the reasons why they are so fucking scary is that if you don't get out in before you are in the warp shadow, you can't transition into the Immatereum and out run the hive ships.  A non-synapse or lone synapse creature getting dragged into the warp? It would probably be lost.  It's hilarious to think of someone looking out the window in a void ship and seeing a lone termagaunt swimming in the warp.

Is there any sort of supreme god character in the Elder Scrolls pantheon? It is 40k canon that the actual tenets of the Imperial Cult vary wildly other than certain core truths. Perhaps the Elder Scrolls planet (Nirn/Mundus) is just a feudal world in the Imperium with an interesting take on the Imperial Cult."
40kLore,3cv15a,PatriotGabe,3,Sat Jul 11 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"Well, tes lore goes something like this. There is an entity called the Godhead who is dreaming everything. In this dream there is two forces, Anu and Padomay who represent/are order and chaos respectively. In the dream, there are a spirits called et'Ada. One of the spirits, Lorkhan finds of a state where a spirits can be become a new Godhead (or something like that). But the immortal spirits are unable to attain that state, so he convinces /tricks a group of spirits to help him create a mortal world, Nirn, though they don't know about the mortal part. These spirits are called Aedra, the ones who don't participate in the construction are called Daedra. At a point, the Aedra realise that Lorkhan tricked them and that the sacrifice of the Aedra's power would be needed to complete Nirn. Magnus, the architect of Nirn, fled to the Aetherius and created the sun (the sun in tes is giant portal and introduces magicka in Nirn) The some other Aedra escaped, too, and created the stars. The et'Ada who were left behind killed Lorkan (his body become the moons) and time started/became linear (I think). The spirits became Ehlnofey, and eventually the races we know."

I think there was a novel about the dark mechanicus working more with combining daemons and machines and people and machines as well as other messed up stuff and machines.   From a more mechanical aspect of game rules, there is usually a divide between aspects character development; psykers and tech priests are like mages and engineers, they specialize in different circles of the venn diagram with a little overlap. We havent seen any psyker tech priests for example. But we can assume that the AdMech would approach its study from a clinical scientific perspective where the psykers who rely on tech would probably care about that stuff as far as it functions and keeps their brains firmly in their skulls and daemon free."

Psykers are a necessary evil for the most part and great precautions must be taken lest their weak flesh and mind will be turned against mankind by Chaos. Same with the warp itself, it's an unreliable component of various necessary technology. They do show great interest in any tech that could make it more predictable, like the Shadowlight, an ancient device that seems to be able to strengthen or weaken the barrier between reality and the Immaterium.  Just like the psykers themselves the Mechanicus must want to know everything about the warp but, at the same time, know that that's a foolish endeavour. ""Well, unless..."" - and that's when things usually go south in the plot :>  Their Chaos counterparts replace machine spirits with daemons and fuse unnatural flesh and steel in sickening, unsanctified ways. They were also, during the Horus Heresy, responsible for destroying much of the knowledge they had painstakingly reassembled after the Age of Strife. So one more reason to beware of psykers who might call forth those forces, I suppose.  I don't know of any tech priest (or higher) who's also a psyker. They must, at the very least, employ navigators for their own ships though."

That said, I think as a general rule they know that nothing good comes from trying to study the Warp. That not to say it isn't temping to many Tech-Priests, forbidden fruit and all that. Warp Shenanigans are most likely extremely frustrating to anyone engaged in seriously attempting to find scientific truth.  The Ad Mech do employ psykers, specify Astropaths, on their Explorator Fleets and Psi-Titans; but those are an exception, part of the Mechanicus initiation involves scooping out the parts of the brain that makes someone psychic and replacing it with cybernetics.

The movies play on the fact that the aliens can be entirely silent and unseen in the right environments, the early hormogaunt models are borderline copyright infringement IMO. The Planetary Marines armor looks the same as the Cadian flak armor, their hand held radar/movement tracker is also echoed in Space Hulk. The IG's Valkyrie also looks almost exactly like the Marines dropship.   Starship Troopers - ""bug aliens"" somewhat capable of extrasolar warfare, controlled via synapse, massive hordes etc. The Marines in Starship troopers can also be the inspiration for much of the Imperium's military might. In the book they are in power armor but the movie their armor is much closer to Cadian style power armor. The highly authoritarian Fascist/Federation government is also a strong tie to the Imperium. Also psychic powers and cybernetic augmentation.  Total Recall- This is a stretch but I like to imagine that all the Xeno stuff they find on Mars is related to the Void Dragon.

There is always tension between races but it never ends in full scale invasions or such. The problem with that fitting in to 40k is that the Emperor legit wants to eradicate all Xeno's, even if they want peace with humanity.  You should figure out a way to make it work, I really like it."
40kLore,3chorc,PatriotGabe,3,Wed Jul 8 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"After a quick look at the lexicanum, the actual Dark Age of Technology didn't really begin until M15 while Star Trek takes place in M3. So there's about 12,000 years in between where the races of Star Trek will die out and be replaced by the races of 40k.   I think it's feasible to believe that, as the galaxy became more and more hostile, the ideals of the Federation faded away as survival became more important, leading the more aggressive and powerful ship designs.   As for the Emperor, he didn't become actively involved until the Age of Strife, so anything in the Dark Age of Technology he wouldn't do anything about."

The jade dragon story line makes no sense at all - if anything - you'd think that they would be hyper secretive like the dark angels otherwise you'd think the inquisition would get involved.  Instead they go chasing after this imaginary beast (and how did the tau find out about it?) and screw up the mission.

As of successor chapter being barely comparable to their First Founding ancestor, Flesh Tearers and  Flesh Eaters are (IMO) that for Blood Angles. Other times some rivality is taken as such an important matter that successor being much stricter in maintaining / embodying primarchs beliefs. Quite a lot of Ultramarines successors are noted to consider Codex Astrates to be taken literally in all respects or Iron Hands successor who are much more (for a lack of better word at the moment) dedicated to purging their flaws at all cost. Other times it's stuff like recklessness in pursue of glory, to one-up their founders like what Storm Lords are to White Scars.  To be frank: I would rather see Bastards of Vulcan, douchebag successor to Salamanders, then see them taken up to eleven and going full hippy and rejecting any means of harm, friend or foe.

I don't own Codex: Skitarrii, but lorewise, the Mechanicum's combat servitors are much broader in their forms, armaments, and styles. If it's a cyborg with a weapon, it's a battle servitor, and as noted above, come in all shapes and sizes. One of the largest and most powerful, the Kataphron servitor, is basically a living tank. If I am correct, by looking at GW's online catalogue, the Skitarrii detachments don't actual have Servitors. That would be Codex: Mechanicum.    All servitors have significant advantages and disadvantages: they are tireless, require little nourishment, and are fearless. They are also generally kind of stupid or slow to react without constant supervision, or both. That said, Astartes servitors are generally used defensively, either to protect installations or a Techmarine in the field.

Personally I would get a bunch of Ogryn drunk and send them in for breaching operations but that's just my style. I think those specific types you mentioned are more of a specialty than an only. For example Catatans (poor spelling. You know the Rambo looking dudes) are thought of as jungle fighters when really they are primed for any type of death world. Also since this is the IG they would totally send the underwater specialists to the desert world because someone in the administration filed paperwork wrong.

40kLore,3c73fn,laffatthemirror,3,Tue Jul 7 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"What are some notable examples of ""we both want the same thing, but my claim is higher then yours"" , and how are those situations resolved?   The Badab War seems like an excellent example, although probably one of the most extreme ones.  At it's heart, it was an entirely economic and political conflict where a group of Space Marine chapters took control of a sector to better enforce their protective cordon near the Maelstrom.   Imperial pressure to make the sector return to paying tithes was rejected, eventually leading to exchange of fire and outright war - which in turn led to Huron Blackheart's Astral Claws turning to Chaos.  If we're just talking about questions of authority and bureaucratic bickering, then that's every single day in the Imperium.   Despite its rigid hierarchies and individuals with absolute authority, the Imperium actually tends to work mainly on a ""might makes right"" basis. An Inquisitor can assume control of a regiment, but it's not because he has a license to do whatever he wants - it's because that license means he can execute or assassinate the regimental commanders one by one until one agrees to obey his orders.  There are a few different sources of power that groups in the Imperium regularly leverage to bring others in line:  1. Might & Reach  ""I listen to whoever can kick my ass, and my boss' ass.""  In a sector where the Inquisition only has a handful of operatives and no significant military assets, you'll be extremely unlikely to see Space Marines giving a shit what those pompous douchebags want.  In a sector where the Inquisition operates its own fleets and elite regiments of storm troopers, crusaders, servitors, assassins, and power-armoured bodyguards... a chapter might get in deep shit if they offend an Inquisitor.  2. Clout & Influence  ""I listen to whoever can turn a mob against me, undo my reputation, or drag me to court.""  An Inquisitor might have unlimited power on paper, but if a cardinal can control the opinion of the most populated worlds in a region, an Inquisitor might do well to avoid offending him.  Similarly, well-connected Inquisitors often use political tools to bend even the mightiest forces to their will. If an Inquisitor can get enough friends together to declare a chapter renegade, then they can effectively turn the entire Imperium against that chapter. A threat of political damage can be more effective than holding a gun to someone's head.  3. Favours & Assets  ""Maybe we can come to an arrangement.""  The fact of the matter is that authority only works if you have the means to exercise it. If you don't... well, if you can't beat someone into submission, maybe you can find a way to help each other instead?  If two organizations are stepping on each other's toes, one might be willing to move its feet if the other can lend a favour.   4. Dependence & Protection  ""I serve them because they are the ones who employ me, put food on my table, keep the lights on, and keep the ammo coming.""  The majority of the power of the Adeptus Mechanicus comes from the fact that if they were to just walk away, the rest of the Imperium would crumble in a couple of years.  Groups like the Imperial Navy are rarely questioned, because they are the only protection you have from the enemies of man, and if you get attacked you don't want the Navy to think twice before deploying.  This is also another reason why the Space Marines can get away with ignoring everybody else most of the time - they don't depend on any other faction. They have their own fleets, their own troops, their own planets, and produce their own equipment. No-one can starve them."

In my own Dark Vengeance set the Space Marine leader guy doesn't have a helmet, and neither does the Librarian [though I suppose this has to do with psychic shenanigans.] and on the Chaos side of things, I seem to recall one of the chaos space marines is literally just holding his helmet in his arm.

For chaos there's plenty of warp related reasons that helmets would be unnecessary from needing the channel warp abilities better to wanting to taste the sacrifices to Khorne, to wanting to better hear the song of Slaanesh.

Whilst it's all well and good for Chaos to go on forever and all that jazz, humans cannont properly exist in the warp. Only powerful pyskers and choas blessed / possessed people can truely live in the warp.   Similar to how daemons cannont properly exist in our reality without some kind of tear in real space, humans and other species cannot properly commit to the warp.   The warp and Chaos are one and the same now (more or less). The warp was once a chilled ocean where things were peaceful and The Old Ones chilled at their leisure. Then Chaos Gods became a thing (partly everyone's collective fault), and since they're not really into the whole peace out bruh thing, the warp is like a raging sea that denies what it pleases. To exist within the warp is to be a part of Chaos now.   As someone else said, Chaos is change and destruction. Nothing can truely exist."

40kLore,3bu0d3,Walkemb,4,Thu Jul 2 05:01:54 2015 UTC,It's kind of like a maelstrom of energy. Very few things hold a physical form while in the warp. It's one of the many reasons Imperial Ships need the Geller (I think that's what it's called) Field.
40kLore,3bu0d3,WombleCat,4,Thu Jul 2 05:05:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the 'lumps' of energy that coalesce into daemons and gods are 'sticky'. Psychic energy from realspace enters the warp in a spread out form, to be snatched up by whichever daemons can get to them first.   But the daemons themselves have their own power now - they do not wholly depend on new psychic energy to exist. So cutting off their food supply, as it were has a limited effect.   But the point about 'good' emotions is interesting - are there anti-Chaos warp creatures? I mean, I really like tidying my desk to have everything in order. If I became OCD about it could my psychic emanations spawn an Order daemon?"
40kLore,3bu0d3,Walkemb,6,Thu Jul 2 08:18:55 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty good theory about that being The Emperor. Grab your heresy helmets, children! Incoming!  The Emperor (since we know is conscious) is going literally insane and sll he wants to do is take control and save everyone. By the time he dies his reflection in the warp is just this twisted energy bent on control and order amongst the chaos. Terra is engulfed by a warp storm as The Emperor dies and a new god is born. Not one of Chaos, but of order.  Don't be fooled. This sounds great on paper but let's think about it. A god fuelled by the beliefs of every single person in the Imperium. The Emperor already was matched to the other four major gods at the time of his holy ascension, but now he truely has transcended our current comprehension of power. Most frighteningly though, this god is not our saviour that we loved and prayed for to give us mercy. This is the twisted, broken image of The Emperor that desired control and order amongst all else.   Human worlds will be enslaved by this god and entire systems will be pulled into the warp as millions of quintillions of people worship this warp fiend. All of which will be totally and unwittingly signing their own death warrents.  Chaos can be fought. Chaos can be beaten. Chaos can be outsmarted and brought low. The fact there is 13 Black Crusades proves this (among other things). But order....  How do you fight order and organisation. Either doom the Imperium by allowing chaos to take hold or con t inue to feed this Beast of Order  A Daemon or God of Order would literally be the worst thing that could happen.   I like to think The Emperor is actually a Perpetual and we should have let him die to be reborn. Great Crusade 2.0 will be pretty if I survive l Iong enough to see it."

I'd see the embodiment of Order as an extremist version of Lawful Neutral, or that this God of Order would basically be Vhailor incarnate, except omnipotent and omniscient. Every action would have a purpose, towards some end goal.  What might be grimdark instead is the absolute utilitarian optimization of the war against Chaos. Labour camps all over the Imperium, and a massed draft everywhere resulting in legions of troops and conscripts sent to fight against Chaos. Where the Imperial Guard were numberless, these forces would be beyond measure. The Adeptus Mechanicus would be destroyed, and a new force would be established from their wreckage to seek the 'pure' convergeance of man with machine, such that in this way man might experience complete harmony and order."
40kLore,3bu0d3,Ed_Cock,3,Fri Jul 3 05:57:35 2015 UTC,"Hm, Order Space Marines could be completely overzealous to the point of insanity, even more than they already are.

They'll even punish or kill their own if one of them fails to live up to their expectations in the smallest way (or, in some cases, if they exceed it). Lots and lots of self-flagellation. Annihilated hive worlds because there probably was a criminal in there. No more sanctified mutants - including navigators. And their warmaster's arms don't fall off."

I'm thinking more along the lines of a Lawful Evil alignment from a D&D setting. Take dark elf society - a rigid hierarchy, strict definitions of duty etc.   Remember Slaanesh is the god of all kinds of passion - so space marines enthusiastically and fervently persecuting each other could be said to be more aligned with Slaanesh than the Star Child."

Were the legions of humanity to abate their fear, would the ruinous powers transmogrify into benevolent, democratic beings?    I would say that yes it is possible since the warp is essentially ""an ocean of chaotic psychic energy, raw emotion given physical form"". The real question is does humanity have emotions not sparked by fear? Say for example a parent becomes happy because their child seems to be doing well in life(the child gets good grades, does something socially right, etc). Did that happiness originally stem from a fear that when the parent was gone that there child would be doomed? Can we as humanity feel something that doesn't have a root to one of our most primal emotions? I hope so."

If it's the Guard, then Guant's Ghosts is the series for you, along with the Ciaphas Cain novels and the Imperial Guard books. Those are the ones that I can personally recommend."

There's a chance the lore might be outdated, but the top books in general for me are D. Abnett's Eisenhorn/Ravenor trilogies, with the upcoming Bequin books as well. Add to that the Gaunt's Ghosts novels, and you're off to a general good start at understanding the Imperium as a whole.  CaptainRobotnik has it right with William King's Space Wolf books - massive detail about how Fenrisian psycho-youths mature into Astartes. For more detail on that, you could try James Swallow's Blood Raven books, I seem to remember a little detail on Rafen's experiences as well.   Of course, the most successful series in Black Library, I'd say, would be the Horus Heresy. Some weaker titles the further in you go, but generally the best reads (not always) can be found in amongst the Heresy series."

They are where I started (almost anyway) and are great for lorehounds because, well, Eisenhorn gets around a whole lot and encounters everything from quaint civilian life to things I don't want to spoil. It's also very well written (first 3 pages or so got me hooked, not something that happens too often), full of memorable characters and includes a bunch of helpful annotations.  It does however not include pages upon pages of space marines killing things. I can't really recommend any book if you specifically want that myself, was fairly disappointed by how dull the one Grey Knights book (Dark Mechanicum) I read was written though.  Actually, if you want lots and lots of power armor action you could pick up the Space Marine video game, if you like those. It's more than solid and might give you a better ""feel"" for the universe as well."

He'd have to wage war when it was needed, and lead his bickering brothers into battle.  So that instantly rules out a few, namely:   Lorgar, too focussed on spreading the word and indoctrination Magnus, hated by a few of his brothers (Mortarion and Russ to name a few) Guilliman, venerated by the worlds he conquered but too hopelessly rule-bound to be useful Angron, because Angry Alpharius, because christ knows what the prick was doing half the time anyway   That leaves the rest, but a few spring out:   Sanguinius, universally loved by his brothers and those that beheld him. I'm not convinced he'd make a brilliant leader though, as he is better off on the field of battle. Fulgrim, weirdly the white-haired, wall-painting, shiny phoenician bastard loved ceremony and general pomposity. He'd suit the job of sitting around gathering forces and would arrange fantastic victory parades. But christ, could you imagine Emperor's Children if he became warmaster? They'd be intolerable! Perturabo, although he's not generally liked, he was clinical and would always make the path of least resistance his bitch. His tactical acumen was second to none when it came to matters of warfare. Dorn, the dude was fanatical yet restrained. He believed entirely in duty and would never falter in executing it. He'd be pretty decent actually   The rest are pretty much too ""eh"" to even come close to being Warmaster. They each have their own skills, but most of them are better off on the battlefield or acting solo."

PART 1  I'd find a means to finish the Webway, even going so far as to collude with the Eldar if necessary. The Emperor seemed to think it was his biggest project ever, so it's must be the top priority. Then I'd begin a new crusade to reunite the remaining of my loyal Primarch Brothers: First and simplest, The Lion would have to be awoken from the Rock. Second, a cure for Guilliman's wounds would be found. During the Webway research, a search for Khan would be enacted. A first crusade against the Necrons would be mounted, in order to find the missing items the Salamanders require to have Vulkan return. A second, larger crusade would also be mounted into the Eye Of Terror, in search of Russ & Corax.  PART 2  With the Primarchs reunited, a new quest would begin. One of vengeance. I would task the Officio Assassinorum with destroying Abaddon, once and for all. Requesting them to focus all efforts on him until the task is done. Even if it means expending every last one of their agents. Then with my brothers at my side I would hunt down the Abominations known as Fulgrim, Perturabo, Angron, Mortarion, Omegon, Magnus & Lorgar. All would have to die. 7 Primarchs vs 7 Daemon Princes. In the ensuing battle, everyone but Magnus and I, are slain. Both heavily wounded and exhausted, I gain the upper hand on Magnus as he collapses. Teetering on death, Magnus repents for all he had done wrong and pleads that he only wanted to protect our father. I offer him redemption and carry his dying corpse to the Golden Throne. There I replace our father's husk, with Magnus' crimson one. Magnus thanks me and takes over control of the Astronomicon, finally 'dying' in the process. With that, the Emperor revives and weeps for his lost sons for many years.  PART 3  When he emerges from his mourning he purges the Imperium of it's questionable practices, including the Inquisition and the Imperial Cult. This time however, hs uses much more careful tact and politics. The New Imperium is formed. The Emperor meets with the Eldar and creates a powerful new alliance, which aims to ensure the survival of both species through mutual respect. I lead this new alliance in a massive extermination campaign against the Tyranids. It remains ongoing, despite us having wiped out several Hive Fleets. Also during this period, The Tau request to join the alliance, which they look upon with awe. Feeling them still unproven, the Eldar and Emperor agree to give them the opportunity to join, but they must first past a 'test'. And that test is to wipe out the Greenskins. All of them. The Tau relish the opportunity and begin an all-out war on the Orks. It also remains ongoing. At this point the Emperor has begun work on a secret new project on Terra, with the purpose of fighting back at the Chaos Daemons. Even I do not know what that project itself is. I guess father will never learn."

Still viable to have conflict with rogue elements of Tau and Eldar. Hell could even be fluffed that the First Crusade didn't wipe out every Tomb world because the Relics we found. Table top integrity would be maintained and storyline would be advanced. I could see this being a massive saga (3-6 books).  I wrote something in this vein on /TG/ for a discussion about the ""The Forgotten"" (The II Legion) returning after the entire legion had gone missing. Never thought about the team up with the Eldar though. And I could totally see the big E being filled with sorrow for years over the loss of his sons.

40kLore,3bm4o0,SpiralDimentia,11,Mon Jul 13 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"Lemun Russ and Corvus are corrupted by the warp they're hunting in, and become Daemon Princes. Jhagatai too, because Dark Eldar. Lion wakes up but turns out, SURPRISE, He really was a dirty, filthy traitor like everyone always suspected. Guilliman wakes up, because he actually -was- regenerating, but from being so close to the point of death he's been driven mad and defects as well, becoming something of a blue flavored Angron. Ferrus Manus is revealed on Mars, his head reattached to a body that is a perfect combination of Primarch and Machine. But the mech in him is corrupted by the remnants of the scrap code the traitors infected mars with, and he defects. Vulkan awakens, but much like Guilleman has been driven to the point of insanity by dying, and defects. The Sanguinar is revealed to be Sanguinius, and Rogal Dorn reappears with mechanical hands, but are so disgusted with how the Imperium turned out that they fight against it as renegades, maybe even defecting. Suddenly to have a war with all the primarchs turned against the Imperium, and the successor chapters torn between fighting for humanity and siding with their beloved Primarchs.    But then, Alpharius appears in between the Primarchs and Terra, revealing himself to not ACTUALLY be a traitor. Turns out, as the last Loyalist Primarch, as the Emperor dies on the Golden Throne he becomes the new Emperor. His sleeper agents in every legion and successor chapters go to work, killing and sabotaging from the inside, weakening the opposing forces enough that his mysteriously full strength Legion can go to work and wipe out the remnants of the Traitors combined forces, showing Alpharius to be the undisputed Master of Warfare. The Guard rallies behind their new leader and they push the traitors back to the Eye, where Alpharius [because only a Primarch can kill a Primarch] slays his traitorous brethren in a single epic showdown. The Chaos Gods combine forces, to combat this new threat on their doorstep. Cypher shows up, and for the first time unveils the sword on his back. TA-DA. It's the Lion's Blade, and Alpharius high fives him and promoted Cypher to Warmaster, and Master of the Fallen Angels, who have sided with the Loyalists because they have always been Loyal to the Imperium of Man. Together, the Emperor and Warmaster engage the combined remaining forces of the Chaos Gods, and while the Loyalist Marines and Imperial Guard take on the fodder and daemons, Emperor Alpharius and Warmaster Cypher throw down the Chaos Gods, freeing the Galaxy of their oppressive Tyranny... for now.    Shit, this started out as a joke, but then I got really into it."
40kLore,3bm4o0,choczynski,2,Tue Jun 30 17:02:28 2015 UTC,This is better then a LOT of the book that GW has put out.
40kLore,3bm4o0,WombleCat,4,Thu Jul 9 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to see them return, I don't believe that will ever happen. The current publication focus is on the Horus Heresy, which is the closest we'll ever get to the primarchs now. There are too many things poised to happen in M42, that can't happen without severely upsetting the balance and potentially destroying entire factions.   The current status quo works fine for GW, and for fans already heavily invested in models."
40kLore,3bm4o0,snowdrifts,2,Tue Jun 30 12:09:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I totally agree it'd probably never happen.  But it's fun to think about."
40kLore,3bm4o0,ICTechnology,4,Tue Jun 30 12:15:14 2015 UTC,"Fantasy's End Times could have been a trial run. If things start looking grim financially in a couple years, after the Heresy wraps up, they could always End Times 40k, and move things to M42 after a big warp storm sweeps the galaxy clean."
40kLore,3bm4o0,jeffe_el_jefe,2,Tue Jun 30 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, they are basically re-doing Warhammer Fantasy with the End Times and the Age of Sigmar. As someone else mentioned, it could be a kind of test run to see how the fans take to it. If it's very successful, I dare say they might consider it with 40k."
40kLore,3bm4o0,TraumaTuna,2,Thu Jul 2 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"Only somewhat related, but I feel that an awesome endgame scenario would be  the imperium descending into civil war due to Such a thing as the emperor dying.  The loyalist primarchs come back, and each perceives the others to have fallen to chaos, based upon what they see of the chapters sectors of space, and each declares a crusade on all/some of the other primarchs. I just think it would be awesome, as it would give GW a fluffy reason to bring back the primarchs without making the SM super OP.   My vision is of the emperor dying, terra being overrun with demons, and his death plunges the imperium into anarchy. This causes the primarchs to come back, and, looking at the imperiums state, each decides it has fallen to chaos. They then go on an a massive spree of murder and destruction, each primarch carving himself a mini-imperium.   And as the emperor is a perpetual, this wouldn't even neccesarily have to be the endgame. He could come back and maybe embark on a second great crusade, to once again reunite the imperium.. Of course, on his own, with maybe the grey knights and inquisition backing him up, he has no chance, an so we have nice little grimdark mess of carnage around the ruins of the imperium."
40kLore,3bm4o0,speakthetrewf,2,Wed Jul 1 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Infighting between primarchs, xenos threats go unchecked and ass rape everything, and Chaos just continues to be chaos."
40kLore,3bm4o0,LukaTheTrickster,3,Wed Jul 1 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"Judging by the current state of the Imperium, the primarchs would be investigsted for heresy, especially the ones that went into the Warp. They would aslo be anti Lectio Divinatatus, and would be branded as heretics because OF COURSE THE EMPRAH IS A GOD HOW DARE YOU SAY OTHERWISE. The Primarchs escape and realise this is not the Imperium they left and, disillusioned, gather as many Spess Muhreens loyal to them as possible, and separate from the Imperium."
