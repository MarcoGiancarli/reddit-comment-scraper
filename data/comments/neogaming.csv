Now the important DRM difference between GOG and Steam is that Steam has no DRM policy, so publishers can use any DRM they like (sometimes Steamworks, often something else altogether). GOG doesn't allow DRM on their store, so nothing you buy on GOG will have DRM, but some things you buy on steam could have DRM. That DRM will not be Steam, because Steam isn't DRM."
neogaming,3dzrym,feralkitsune,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:34:44 2015 UTC,You are splitting hairs. Steamworks is a part of steam.

neogaming,3dzrym,sumthingcool,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"Steam is Drm.   Steam is a digital distribution platform that offers optional DRM services. There are plenty of games on Steam that use no DRM, you can download the game files, copy them wherever and run without Steam (exactly like GOG is touting). I know for sure McPixel works that way, done it myself. Hell, you can do this with The Witcher 3 version on Steam as it is DRM free...  So yeah, it offers DRM as an option, but that does not make Steam DRM. The big diff is GOG refuses to offer DRM to publishers at all, which is a fine stance to take, but it will limit their marketability to publishers."
neogaming,3dzrym,feralkitsune,0,Tue Jul 21 01:22:12 2015 UTC,You just repeated what I said but in many more words. Yes steam is Drm. Just not for all games. It's still drm.

Then it is. Downloading isn't what makes it DRM, locking games to accounts is. If I buy TF2 on my account on steam, the game has DRM. I can't have a buddy log onto his steam account and click the EXE and expect it to run if he doesn't also own the game. I can't simply copy the game's files to his PC and expect him to run the game. You know why this is?   DRM"

Same specs on paper =/= same performance. Nvidia QUADRO and other workstation GPUs are made for one reason and one reason only. And that is rendering images. Look up render farms, specifically Pixar if you wanna see some serious shit.  Titan cards are very interesting because yes, you can get the same performance out a 980 Ti for hundreds less. But the Titan series exists as a hybrid workstation/gaming card. And before the 980 Ti came out. No single card could even hope to beat the Titan cards in gaming or workstation performance. Even though it's cheaper to buy a dual card setup.  tl;dr - Titan is hybrid card, QUADRO is for Pixar level shit. I'm talking those car commercials that are clearly impossible but you can't distinguish from real life were rendered on a QUADRO."

Modern day was good here too.    Revelations didn't improve much in terms of mechanics or graphics. Constantinople is very unique though and I liked it a lot. I also enjoyed the story. Modern day had little gameplay, but a lot of background stories about Desmond.    3 is a huge game, but sadly a little unpolished, especially in the side quests and UI. Parkour was improved. Great attention to detail though, in the world building. Modern day was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of the ending.     4 (Black Flag) was very enjoyable, but a very different game. Naval was a huge part. I really liked the story though. Modern story wasn't that great IMO.    Unity was ambitious. Patches made it much better. It looks gorgeous and I mostly liked the gameplay changes. The dedicated stealth button and the improved parkour make it really hard to go back to the older titles sometimes. The city is also insanely detailed. It's a pleasure simply watching the NPCs at work. I also think the mission design was better than previous titles.

neogaming,3cwm36,jukerainbows,5,Sun Jul 12 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"To come very slightly to Ubisoft's defense, I don't see EA putting out things like Child of Light or Grow Home.  Assassin's Creed is, without a doubt, their cash cow franchise. But if you look at EA and Activision, pretty much their entire line up are annual franchise releases. Need for Speed, Call of Duty, Battlefield, EA Sports, etc.  Typically only Microsoft and Sony invest in those weird, art-house one offs; but Ubi is a rare third party that likes to as well. And while Devolver and Adult Swim Games have been making waves, you can't argue that Ubisoft isn't bigger than those two. Even if Watch Dogs and The Crew fell into familiar 'Ubisoft Openworld Game' design philosophy, you can't argue that they aren't new IPs with some new ideas.  So, I agree with their statement. Of the big three 3rd party publishers, Ubisoft does more experimenting with new IPs and publishing small studio games. I tend to think Sony takes even more risks though, but you can't really be a rival with a platform you publish on."

But seriously, I hadn't heard of it... I googled it and found the Irish Pewdiepie squealing while playing it... it was frightening.  Though it looks interesting.  Child of Light was an amazing game, it slipped right there at the end where the final boss felt rushed after the pacing between boss one and two.  But, for me it was game of the year for 2014.    So, I concede that they definitely were the only ones to make me put down my murder simulators and play a beautiful poem with fun gameplay and whimsical art."
neogaming,3cwm36,specterofthepast,4,Sun Jul 12 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"Grow Home was incredibly short (yet still longer than Gone Home!

Ubi was also behind Valiant Hearts, which I can't speak to, but an artsy world war 1 story hinging on emotion and tragedy instead of pew-pew is another nice mark for their overall portfolio."

neogaming,3clqub,Clockw0rk,16,Wed Jul 8 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"You know, I believe the reason there is a 'taboo' about talking about how much money people make.. is because a lot of companies are fucking their workers and not paying them a fair wage.  I mean, you could be mad that the star of the latest blockbuster movie made 50 million dollars, you could be mad that the star quarterback made 100 million dollars in a 4 year contract. That's a lot of money! But... those are also forms of entertainment with enormous market appeal. Worldwide box office for Avatar was 2 Billion dollars. That's billion, with a B. Even if everyone involved in making the movie took home a few million dollars, the studio is still taking home a billion in profit.  So PewDiePie made a few million dollars. How much do you think Google made off the ad revenue they shared with PewDiePie? They certainly didn't give him 100%.  If you want to complain about fair wages, start at the root of the problem. Capitalism. Even the WSJ knows that the system is designed that the rich get richer.  PewDiePie didn't take millions of dollars away from soldiers or cancer research. He just happened to do what he enjoyed on Google's platform, which earned Google a whole lot of money, and Google shared a piece of their enormous pie with him. Wealth is cultivated by the wealthy. PewDiePie didn't even sell a tangible product, he was just a vehicle for other people to sell their products, and those wealthy businesses gave him a cut.  In the immortal words of Ice-T: Don't hate the player, hate the game."

The next console really has to be more straightforward to program for, and give a better experience and performance than the current 8th gen consoles.

If this were android, you'd have a few other distribution methods to get this game out there to the people who want to play it, assuming of course that google would be this daft. But with apple products, if it's not from the app store, you're basically forced to void your warranty by jailbreaking to gain access to it.  I know there's a lot of hate on apple in general in the pc gaming community, and on reddit, and I tend to be one of the people heaping it on. But, not for the usual ""hue hue overpriced and they have no games"" reasons. More for the fact that apple's threatened to do the same thing with their personal computers, and they actively cultivate a culture where you don't even have control over your own systems to repair or upgrade your own hardware.  While I can understand the convenience, and ""It just works"" is probably pretty appealing, god damn is it bad for the customer in the long run. Of course, I say this as someone who bought an itouch once (for 450 bucks, I might add) and literally less than a year and a half later they announced that they were dropping all support for it/charging an extra 40 bucks for an upgrade to its os.

I mean, if you know what your audience wants and you still refuse to deliver, you're just an asshole instead of an idiot.  Much like the Final Fantasy 7 remake, Square-Enix knew fans wanted that. They had to have known. They must know how many butt tons of money they're going to make not just from the game, issuing a whole new wave of merchandise. Their effective refusal to do it for so long was seemingly out of spite. It almost begs the question if they're simply in such dire financial straits that they're now forced to do FF7 Remake and KH3 to stay in the black rather than appease fans.  Kudos to Square for daring to remake one of the longer games ever made. Of all the remakes and remasters thus far, FF7 is easily the largest remake undertaking.  Now, I'm going to come right out and say it: First party Nintendo games are not complex games.  Do you know how Ubisoft cranks out a new Assassin's Creed every year?  They have two teams, and contract additional work out. Hundreds of NPCs, scale reproductions of miles of cities, hours of voice acting, sometimes even hours of fully animated cutscenes.  How the fuck does it take you 5 years to churn out another franchise instalment?   Sunshine was a unique experience, Galaxy was a unique experience. The 'New Super Mario Bros' series is little more than the original 2D mario formula with upgraded graphics and multiplayer. The 3D world games are virtually the same thing, but with a slightly angled camera for true 3D movement. So where is the next unique Mario experience? The Wii U is practically dead in terms of 3rd party support, and it looks like Mario Maker will be the last Mario game on the platform with the NX 2 or 3 years away. So that means the Wii U will have no robust single player mario story. What a fucking shame.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that most Metroid fans would be all over a proper HD remaster of the Metroid Prime trilogy on Wii U. Use that gamepad screen as a visor view, it'd be sick. HD Master of Sunshine would sell great too. Can you imagine the liquid effects with modern graphics? Hell, people would lap up a VC re-release of the original, but they won't do that either.  If you didn't know your market so you can't deliver, it would be incompetence. But if you claim to know your market and you don't deliver, you're just an asshole.  Quit being assholes, Nintendo. Fix your fucking deplorable account system, fix your fucking eshop and purchases being tied to hardware, fix your fucking supply chain issues with Amiibos, and start hiring more goddamn people if you're so short staffed that you can't make a game in a timely fashion. Why the fuck was Splatoon pushed out the door half finished?  For fuck sake, people would give you so much money if you just did as they asked. Instead, I watch your E3 conference this year, and I wonder why I bought a console to play less than 10 games on it. I would've gotten more use out of a 3DO."

Yeah... no.  The extra missions you added (free) for replay value are so repetitive they are not even funny. (main game was awesome though I laughed out loud several times while playing and felt great!)  I traded the game in, it was sweet and I liked it but it was over way too soon.   You should have promoted it more and priced it better. Also just LISTEN to your audience. not just place polls ""on what dlc you want to buy?"" read the forums!   About multiplayer.  You should have taken all events out, and just leave the tower defense game. (or at least the option) because everybody leaves while playing any other event.  p.s. Also yeah when I trade it back in the pricing was ridiculously low, why? because you gave it away for free in a version of xbox one thats why!  extra p.s. If you started noticing the game was doing bad why in the world didnt you start giving away at least older DLC for free to attract people back?

Because the gimmick is that the handheld version will be the same game just with reduced graphics, and you can transfer game data so that if you have to leave. You can continue playing on the handheld version. Supposedly it'll be a seamless transition and pick up exactly where you left off. But I doubt that last bit will come to fruition.

neogaming,3am57k,specterofthepast,2,Sun Jun 21 18:34:11 2015 UTC,I think I bought a DVD video based on this series out of a bargain bin on a lark.

But, even just watching for 5 minutes I saw camera issues, repetitive gameplay mechanics, and admittedly good enemy design.  I don't expect the world, but my spite for SJWs only goes so far.  Though I admit that I am sitting next to the card game Tentacle Bento which I bought solely because SJWs tried to boycott it and preordered the Tomb Raider reboot when they called it sexist for showing violence against women."
neogaming,3am57k,specterofthepast,12,Sun Jun 21 21:37:53 2015 UTC,Since were not on KIA i feel like I have to point out the game looks terrible actually. Those environments look straight out of the PS1.

neogaming,3afwq1,jukerainbows,5,Sat Jun 20 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"It really isn't about graphics. To me the biggest improvement of the next gen is better and more plentiful AI. The fact that we can have more complex AI(What if I told you the mass amount of zombie games last gen was because the simple AI was easy on hardware?) and able to create the large scale battles we could only dream of last gen is great and the biggest reason I bought into in next-gen.  In short, don't improve your graphics, improve your features."

neogaming,3afwq1,morzinbo,2,Sat Jun 20 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm okay with that. I don't play most games because they're pretty- I play them because they're fun. Yes, a prettier game is always a bonus, but we've seen time and time again that low effort graphics can have some of the best gameplay. I've easily put over a thousand hours into FTL, unmodded, because the gameplay is fun, addicting, and more importantly, the graphics don't detract from the game as a whole."
neogaming,3afwq1,shaneathan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:49:48 2015 UTC,But in terms of something like a Bethesda game from last Gen the graphics are so bad that it does detract from the gameplay. Graphics do matter. From being able to support more objects on the screen doing things that make the place feel alive. If everything looks like I drew it in mspaint while I'm exploring a 3D world at 1080p+ it would be jarring.  Not that I think the graphics look horrible from the promo. I'm worried that since it's a trailer that it won't. What I'd rather have is proper animations. Fucking blocky and choppy as hell in Fallout 3 and nv.
neogaming,3afwq1,jukerainbows,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, though. Bethesda isn't known for glorious Blur-level graphics. All of their open world games have been pretty, but not glorious. Dishonored was good looking for its era, but not top notch. People don't buy Fallout or Skyrim because it's pretty. With the exception of users on /r/gaming and its ilk, I'd honestly wager that a majority of players don't mod their games at all. They play Bethesda games for the experience"
neogaming,3afwq1,shaneathan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:53:04 2015 UTC,I whole heartedly agree. How long have we been using the same physics engines? So man things can actually happen instead of making just super fine textures.
neogaming,3afwq1,xhabeascorpusx,2,Sat Jun 20 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not only about graphics, the sheer size, scope and power behind games nowadays are what most excited me. The fact that I can literally get lost in game worlds now amazes me.  However, better graphics can improve the experience. If visual quality won't impair gameplay quality then you should always aim to make your game the best looking it can be."
neogaming,3afwq1,UberAndrew,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I can deal with their terrible engine if the game itself is good, New Vegas for instance was amazing.  My main issue with Bethesda games is that they usually have a static world that's puddle deep.  I couldn't actually bring myself to explore in Skyrim because I knew that the world wont get affected by anything I do, so I just didn't want to bother.

neogaming,3af29k,mracidglee,3,Fri Jun 19 16:35:47 2015 UTC,all of them  because backward compatibility should kinda be standard and not limited to certain titles

neogaming,3ac2iv,phlap,2,Thu Jun 18 23:54:09 2015 UTC,What a great game. There is a bug on the 360 version where the game can crash during autosave and you have to start again. I was initially pissed but then had a blast replaying it again up to that point doing things differently. Then went back and played it again after that.

Do you know what made Animal Crossing appealing? Not interior decorating. It's that it gave you a little something to do EVERY day. You know what made Metroid appealing? Not chibi art styles and multiplayer. I could explain what makes Metroid appealing but then I'd be here all night. And I want to sleep
