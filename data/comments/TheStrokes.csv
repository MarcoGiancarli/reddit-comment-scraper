TheStrokes,3e538x,jesuslaves,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"My introduction to the band was pretty shaky, lots of going back and forth between albums. I first listened to ITI in 2011 and loved it from the start, i remember watching the 2 dollar bill show and thinking ""this is so cool!!!"". Couldn't get into ROF for some reason, and only liked a couple of songs off FIOE, mainly Juicebox. Angles, i didn't understand what was going on at all. Then CM came out and I liked it a lot, always listened to it all the way through. Then i remember randomly listening to What Ever Happened? which made me go back and listen to ROF, FOIE, and Angles all over again, and I realized how amazing all their albums are, and they became my favorite band. So I started paying more attention to Julian's solo stuff, I enjoyed Phrazes, and was super excited when the Voidz were formed, then Tyranny was finally released and it blew everything out of the water. Right now, I'd say ROF is my favorite Strokes album, with Tyranny being my favorite of all time."

I was introduced to the major hit singles (YOLO, Is This It, Last Nite, etc.) at first from an old roommate. Angles was one of the first album I downloaded (of The Strokes), and it was my jam of summer 2012. The early months of 2013 involved my roommate and I hyping up for CM and we agreed that it was quality work. It didn't take me till late 2013-2014 to fully appreciate RoF, ITI, and the first half of FIOE."

As i saw the first few Pictures, i thought he looks like Junkie, but i got used to it cause i loved the music. From time to time he looked always cooler to me and became somehow my styling idol (nohomo). And the first Album i got into was CM , even though i already knew about angles somehow cause i heard Macchu Picchu on fifa 12, but didnt realized it was from the Strokes"

TheStrokes,3e24lf,Fabsolution,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:55:24 2015 UTC,"I think they are really really good. Kevin Parker is to Tame Impala as Julian is to The Strokes, except even more so since he even records most of the album on his own.    Start with Lonerism, unless you're really unsure about psychedelic (in which case start with Currents, their new LP). If you don't want to listen to the whole album I would try Feels Like We Only Go Backwards, Elephant, Let It Happen, Eventually  I don't know if it's fair to put TI in my top 3 since Strokes/Smiths have had their spots for at least 2 years now, whereas I just started listening to Tame Impala less than 6 months ago.

In short, these are my top artists because I like and enjoy all of or most (90+% ) of their songs and also because some have sick style (in terms of album artwork, art, music videos, clothes, etc)  1.) New Order   B/c they are well-established and have more work out then the rest of my other top artists and their previous Joy Division/Warsaw work as well. Also a lot of songs/bands I like are New Order/Joy Division influenced or sounding; heck, this top list 3/5ths comprised of New Order sonically influence band - Corners, The Creases, & New Order.  This song reminds me of the Unidan Jackdaw/Crow mishaps: Murder - as the lyrics goes screaming CROWS! I HATE CROWS!  2) The Strokes  including Julz solo work Phrazes. Also The Strokes have sick style and in terms of style Top List, they beat out all the artists in this list.  3) Corners  Up and coming new LA post-punk/goth/surf punk/garage rock band; High hopes for this band in making it, very unique songs. Also, each member have their solo work prior to formation of band to which I really like as well. This band might even potential to top The Strokes on my list for me if they continue to put out more work (and exceed than that of The Strokes)   4) GRMLNS - Makes me want to go outside  Can't decide between Crawling Into You or Teenage Rhythm  5) The Creases  I fuckin love this band a lot; thanks to whoever it was from this subreddit that recommended Gradient. Here is another one I like: Do You Know Why. Its very upbeat.  Honourable mentions: Judas Priest, Daft Punk, Justice, Breakbot (can be Top 5 if he has more work out), Cloud Nothings, The Cure, Two Wounded Birds, and Crystal Castles."

TheStrokes,3e0kco,Hitsu123,7,Tue Jul 21 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"Angles and Comedown Machine ae my favorite Strokes albums. Fuck the haters, way more fun songs and better lyrics. I like that every song isn't about getting down to fuck, I like that the songs have great instrumentals and dynamics. There's a lot of bands, today, that rip off the first two strokes albums, but no band sounds like Angles or Comedown era Strokes - the modern strokes.   Angles has 3 of the best Strokes songs of all time - UCoD, Taken for a Fool and Machu Picchu."
TheStrokes,3e0kco,50_shades_of_clay,2,Tue Jul 21 04:01:56 2015 UTC,"Id say FIOE is a good mix of good lyrics, awesome instrumentals, and dynamics. Sucks that alot of people don't like some of the middle songs. It's a great album"
TheStrokes,3e0kco,AcidOnTheBrain_,3,Tue Jul 21 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"I listen to it in my car all the time, because it's the only CD of theirs I still own, and I can say this - a lot of the songs kind go mix together. But, I noticed that Fear of Sleep has some amazing instrumentals (namely the bass.) That song, lately, has been making me rewind to hear a 5 second run. Haha, anyways - yes. That album is good, but it just does feel too much of the same. That's why I love their last two albums, a ton of dynamics - every song is different."
TheStrokes,3e0kco,50_shades_of_clay,6,Tue Jul 21 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"I absolutely like every single song on Angles, I wish they had more Metabolisms and You're So Rights in their other albums"
TheStrokes,3e0kco,Minerali,9,Tue Jul 21 03:03:58 2015 UTC,You're So Right is the best song on Angles. I'm serious is anyone else listening to the same song. No hate plz I don't want to fight about it.

TheStrokes,3dwymm,8494,5,Mon Jul 20 05:42:35 2015 UTC,Here's a simple little pic I took
TheStrokes,3dsh46,ghtuy,30,Sun Jul 19 00:50:13 2015 UTC,I think it's their best album since ROF. FOIE and Angles have some of their best songs but also some of their worst. Comedown Machine is solid all the way through.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,greatestape,7,Sun Jul 19 01:25:29 2015 UTC,I always say Angles has some of tbe highest highs and lowest lows. Undercover of Darkness and taken for a fool are among their very best songs.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,RGSagahstoomeh,6,Sun Jul 19 19:41:15 2015 UTC,Completely agreed.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Xen64,10,Sun Jul 19 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"I rather enjoyed it. In fact Comedown Machine was the album that got me interested in the Strokes. I had heard of them before, but it wasn't until I listened to Comedown Machine that I actually came to appreciate their music. I thought that it was a little bit more on the electro pop side, but I really enjoyed it. I realize that I don't have the familiarity or attachment to their sound that someone who has been a fan since the beginning, but I think it is silly to write off CM just because they deviated a little bit from their usual sound. Sometimes I feel like fans get a little entitled when it comes to this type of thing. They seem to act like it is the band's duty to keep producing music that appeals to them. I think that is erroneous. If bands have a duty to their fans to keep producing the sound that the majority of their fans want, that restricts their artistry. Musicians should have the freedom to explore their musical abilities."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,SkyFall96,5,Sun Jul 19 02:50:22 2015 UTC,That's precisely it! The best bands are the ones that evolve their sound.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Wingzerofyf,6,Sun Jul 19 03:02:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with Angles is that it's extremely incoherent, with few great singles tho. On the other hand Comedown Machine falls under the category of ""most underrated"" albums of the 10's."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,AcidOnTheBrain_,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"Right, I get that voice with Angles. They wanted to branch out, but they didn't pick enough of a direction. Comedown Machine was a more refined attempt of that same thing."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Sadsharks,6,Sun Jul 19 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Gonna ramble here, cause fuk it, but I have a theory, especially considering Angles got better reviews then CM and FIOE, that when they came back they played the game, exchanged money and got all the press coverage they got (Spin cover story, covered by Pitchfork, Ellen.) They got headaches with all the press/communities focusing on ""the narrative"" and music being the last thing people were talking about. So as a sort of fuck you, and knowing if they didn't play the game there next record would be marginalized (because the last thing reviewers give a damn about is the actual music), dropped CM as they did. It could have been RCA holding back funding cause the boys reiterated they wouldn't resign, it could have been that CM is as far away from the ITI-record people clamored for. But the cover of CM, the inner artwork, the silence surrounding it, it seems like a record intended to be lost in the present and made to be stumbled upon in the future. It's their most cohesive, every song has the same vibe/atmosphere, record since ITI (Save for All the Time which seems like them saying, ""You guys want the old stuff, fine heres a half-hearted diddy, and an indicator of the amount of fucks we could give to retreading old water"") and the tunes speak for themselves. Like ITI, every song, save for All the Time, is a killer. To give some weight to my thoughts, I think Albert had said they were really stoked on the stuff they were recording in anticipation of CM, and Julian has had a belief that innovators don't necessarily get the cred they deserve in their own times.   But personally, next to ITI, CM is my favorite record of theirs, and goes to show reviewers just want to create a narrative, and people think they want the same and are selfish for doing so (""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”)"
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Wingzerofyf,3,Sun Jul 19 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"That is a really interesting theory, it certainly seems like the kind of record you'd find in a box marked ""used"" at a music store."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Walksonthree,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:45 2015 UTC,And then some group of kids are gonna make a band in the 30's and make it their own sound and absolutely explode hahaha imagine?
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Ammarzk,2,Mon Jul 20 04:41:09 2015 UTC,What's your problem with All the Time?
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Fabsolution,4,Mon Jul 20 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's just lackluster, I don't know. It's seems too contrived/strokesy, very out of place next to the other, predominately spacey, tracks within the whole album; the half-hearted delivery during the verse (""ya neva ask why ya never dun dun"") though the lyrics are good. It's just my opinion, and I know it was the first single, but I'd rather have Tap Out or Partners in Crime be a single (and feel their better indicators of the record as a whole, along with OWT) rather then All the Time; it's ""Oh it's a return to form"" vs. ""Oh their going experimental"". Though I'll recognize All of the Time is still one of the only tracks that gets played live off CM, but it just sounds like a b-side, again it's just IMO."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,DraperWhite,5,Mon Jul 20 06:43:15 2015 UTC,Slow Animals and Partners in Crime are two of the solidest songs they have ever put out.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,greatestape,3,Sun Jul 19 12:40:52 2015 UTC,Welcome to Japan bruh
TheStrokes,3dsh46,Underdog76,3,Mon Jul 20 10:57:44 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion Comedown Machine is criminally underrated. Yes, it has different styles, so I understand why some fans do not like the new sound, but that does not mean it is bad per se. I think the exact same holds up for Muse's The 2nd Law, although in this case unfortunately the magical effects may have worn of by overplaying the album. And there will be many more examples. Whenever a band changes his sounds, there will be a shock between the music and the fans."
TheStrokes,3dsh46,SoaringMuse,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:51 2015 UTC,I think the consensus is that Angles is their worst album. Comedown Machine is probably my third favorite. It never lost its charm with me like Angles did.
TheStrokes,3dsh46,cinderwild2323,2,Sun Jul 19 12:10:21 2015 UTC,Everybody was just so excited to have a new album after 5 years and I think everybody overreacted. By July of 2011 I was barely listening to it anymore.

GRMLN - Teenage Rhythm   To keep this short as possible: I FKN LOVE GRMLN! like all their 3 albums and all their songs on it. Their are very easy to listen to and poppy; they sound like garage-rock/pop punk from the 90s minus the glossy vocals. Singer is like 21 and currently in college at UC Santa Cruz (similar age as me which is pretty cool to know that someone at my age and in college can make good music). I also FKN love Teenage Rhythm. Can easily put it on repeat. Other songs to check out if you are interested in GRMLN that should be easy listening: Jaded; Crawling Into You; White Lung/Black Lung; Blue Lagoon (catchy as fk and it makes me just happy and optimistic about my life and my future just listening to this); 1993; Coastal Love; and Do You Know How It Feels"

Feverishly loved and, to some extent, withholding. Anyone invested in the band is eager for more music and more shows, even if they’re amongst the fans who were let down by the last two Strokes releases. “I’m still in the band. It was a big thing in my life, I love it very much. I don’t mind answering questions about it,” Hammond says when I start by saying I assume he’s frustrated by answering Strokes questions all the time. Last month, Hammond made comments about how the Strokes have no future plans beyond Austin City Limits in October. After Casablancas had said he was working on new Strokes material, a lot of people took the quote slightly out of context, interpreting it as a bleak outlook on the future of the band, or Hammond’s own disenchantment with the slow-moving machine the group has become.  In reality, he meant it as positively as he could. As Hammond puts it, he’s simply become burnt out on not having a real answer for people. “I was tired of being like, yeah, we’re doing stuff…I don’t know what we’re doing. I would love to tell you,” he explains. “If anything, it saddens me to have not done stuff.” As for Casablancas’ comment, apparently the band did try some stuff out. They went into the studio, worked on two recordings, Casablancas sang on one of them a few months later. “That’s what I mean, the machine now is moving very slowly,” Hammond explains. “There’s nothing I can do to speed it up. After a while, you feel drained from it because of how much I love it and care for it.” If there’s any weariness in Hammond’s voice now or at any other points when asked about the Strokes, it’s because he truly seems to want to be doing more Strokes stuff alongside his own work. “My personality kinda needs me to leave it on the side,” he says regarding the periods of relative inactivity in the band. “I can’t put the burner on simmer. If I put the burner on, I have all these ideas and I want to do all this stuff, and then I get depressed when nothing happens.”   so comforting to hear ;-;"
TheStrokes,3dnjoa,Walksonthree,4,Fri Jul 17 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"But the dream, the world Hammond wants to see, is the world where the Strokes continue on and he’s doing his own thing, too. That’s the ideal.  Hammond, at least, does not seem disenchanted or disinterested in the Strokes. He still clearly loves being in that band, and talks of what they’ve achieved enthusiastically as anything else today — if anything, you can see how being the main cheerleader within the band may have worn him down. You can see how he may have grown weary of telling everyone the band is revving up, and then having fans get pissed at him when he was wrong. The Strokes, as he describes them, are an operation that is disorganized when it comes to reconciling their individual interests with the band. It’s stop-start, things get stalled. But he has faith in it all. “I feel like we still have a great record to make. Or more,” he says. “I feel like a lucky band that’s liked by a lot of people. It seems silly to not make music.”   I could cry."

The Strokes are hands down my favorite band, and I think we share some similar sounds. We vary a good bit, so if you like this song please check out the others posted on our YouTube channel and tell us what you think. Sorry for the cruddy audio/video, we're saving up some cash right now to get some studio time. When that finally happens, I'll definitely be posting the results here.  P.S.

I haven't had these problems with any of these records (I have all but the EP). Though I kind of advise against FIOE vinyl, it's okay (i don't have any skips or anything), but it does have the worst sound quality of all of the albums imo. Not just the vinyl, the clipping on the mix is just overload, does not transfer well for hi-fi listeners."

Like with Tyranny, don't you feel it should have been 'bigger'? Well Albert wants MM to be huge and successful, something that cult can't do for him."
TheStrokes,3ditf0,bloodslide,3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"So while he was penning, writing, recording and starting to promote Momentary Masters, it must have been somewhat of a conflict to hit the road again with The Strokes - with no new material to push but a planet of fans sorely missing them. Is that the case, or did it drive him to compete with his own legacy?   ""I think the biggest competition with that is more trying to create something where Strokes fans can like it but you're trying to find new fans too. I guess it's always been a healthy competition. We don't always plan the shows to feel the back and forth. With The Strokes, as much as you need to convince people, they're already convinced. They're there to just enjoy it. I'm still trying to establish myself so everywhere I go, my energy is of a 'make it or break it' kind of feel.  ""You've got to try and conquer. Maybe if we made a new record we'd try to conquer but right now, it's just not as much of a challenge. It's fun, but it's not a challenge.""  And now for the question on all of our lips - The Hyde Park show was an electrifying experience of these legends on top form, but how would Hammond describe the 'spirit' of being in The Strokes in 2015?   ""I think you need to ask someone else,"" he admits. ""I have no idea. My personality just doesn't allow for that so I keep The Strokes on the side until I have something going on. Otherwise it would just drain me of energy.""  Did the hunger and desire for those shows give off the feeling that the world is 'missing' a band like The Strokes at the moment?  ""Yeah. It would be rude of me to say 'yes, why not?' but of course - people love what we do and have an affinity for it, and if anything that's what's sad about it.  ""It's the missed opportunity of not playing the shows that's sad. I know that, I feel that, but if I keep on thinking like that I'm going to shoot myself in the head - because it's fucking depressing.""  ""It's encouraging to see Hammond at the peak of his songwriting powers now then - grabbing the opportunity, seizing the day and standing tall on his feet. Now is his time. Hammond may struggle to give it a name, but there's only one word for it: 'freedom"

I like FIOE and Angles but I have to be honest with myself and admit they're flawed albums. Comedown Machine was the first album since Room On Fire that I enjoy listening to straight through.

TheStrokes,3dg9uc,Cuntosaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think it is pretty obvious and I think that most would agree that Is This It is their best album, and probably always will be. For me, the thing that does it, is that I can literally, and have, put on the album and listened to the whole thing on repeat for hours without getting bored. Every song is great and they tie together in a way that compliments each other as well.  Room on Fire, while a great album (all of them are) would probably be my fourth favorite. Not because they sort of shut down or anything like that, but mostly because I like Angles and Comedown Machine more.  FIOE would be my least favorite album, but that is mostly because of the background behind the album. For example, Julian was never really with the band to record this album and only sent in music clips of his voice and emailed his ideas to the group. Also, I think they added too much work in one album, they should have had songs like Killing Lies, 15 Minutes, or Fear of Sleep as B-side material. However, if I judged their albums by the percentage of songs I like per album, this would then be number two on my list.  Angles. What a fantastic album. Definitely a close second to Is This It. In so many ways it was a rebirth of their music, especially due to the hiatus following FIOE. Not only that but they have more complex stuff going on and a different sort of style that although completely different than the strokes, still has that core Strokes sound to it. Additionally, Under Cover of Darkness. Just, great.  Comedown Machine. Again, great. Sometimes I put this album on play and think I am listening to something out of Julian's Phrazes for the Young. Not an insult to the Strokes as a whole because it remains obvious that, again, at the core, it is the strokes. Tap Out and One Way Trigger are works of art."

TheStrokes,3dg9uc,manualex16,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:19 2015 UTC,Because ITI and ROF were two half hour records that were on your face. FIOE is a slowburner and longer than both together. Also the second half has some experimental stuff(for Strokes thats it) and people loved some and disliked the rest.

In the beginning, the whole ""Death"" deal and all. He's obviously running away from it but it catches up eventually. Losing touch, maybe he's going crazy?"
TheStrokes,3d935x,greatestape,5,Tue Jul 14 13:35:38 2015 UTC,This makes me so happy. Albert just really seems to be doing great and I feel like he is so happy with this album and it just makes me so happy for him that I can't even think of another word to use. Happy

I can see how it's poppy, but I like to think of as a mix between classical composing style (?), swing rock, and low-key garage rock type of stuff. idk, whenever I hear the song I just want to get up and dance, and I really hate dancing"

Things like Business Dog and M.A.D really do seem quite metal and really fucking heavy. But then you have things like Nintendo Blood which is kinda more synthy, then Human Sadness which is classical, and a bunch of other songs that seem to take from other genres. God, ""Tyranny"" is such a genius album. To be so vast while still maintaining a consistent and recognisable sound style is brilliant."

TheStrokes,3d4yna,BadassBuddusky,40,Mon Jul 13 15:47:10 2015 UTC,Presumably because of his bitchin' voice
TheStrokes,3d4yna,iimalteaserii,13,Mon Jul 13 17:08:41 2015 UTC,He's also said in interviews he didn't feel like a competent enough guitarist to play and sing at the same time. I can only imagine how different The Strokes would be if this were the case however.

TheStrokes,3d4yna,Clarkey101,3,Mon Jul 13 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"This would've been disastrous. Albert's playing style was hugely influential on the Strokes' sound, particularly his weird windmill down-stroke technique. Without him, Is This It wouldn't feel nearly as tight and mechanical."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,dreamshoes,3,Tue Jul 14 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, certainly. Their sound relies too much on clear, mechanical layering to not have a dedicated rhythm guitar."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,ghtuy,3,Wed Jul 15 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"Haha have you seen the videos of him playing and singing his solo stuff? I'm sure he's not trying too hard and he probably didn't practice much, but it's not exactly graceful."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,fries_in_a_cup,13,Tue Jul 14 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know the reasoning, but I sure do love hearing him hit those low notes. I like Alberts voice too, but I feel like Julian's is more unique."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,SimplySabrina,4,Mon Jul 13 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of their songs would be really hard to play and sing at the same time. Julian would spend to whole show staring at his guitar if he played. Plus, I don't think he's a very good player. There's some videos of him on Youtube that are downright awful."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,greatestape,4,Mon Jul 13 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"Most of the videos I've seen of Julian playing guitar were of him singing while playing it.  True, his guitar playing during that wasn't good, but he has said that he can't play and sing at the same time.  He may be much better at playing when not singing."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,DosZaquis,3,Tue Jul 14 03:04:20 2015 UTC,Even the parts where he isn't singing are pretty bad...
TheStrokes,3d4yna,greatestape,7,Tue Jul 14 03:06:32 2015 UTC,I always assumed he was trying to remember how to play the songs but I could be wrong.
TheStrokes,3d4yna,DosZaquis,4,Tue Jul 14 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"Some of his other playing shows he's pretty good though. The Instant Crush solo for one. Also when I talked to Beardo after the Voidz show, he told me that he's pretty sure Julian played the Xerox solo. I wouldn't be surprised if he played the solo for Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse's ""Little Girl"" as well as it sounds like his playing style and he already contributed vocals to the track."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,fries_in_a_cup,3,Tue Jul 14 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"According to this and Julian's Wikipedia page, he played the solo on ""Little Girl"".  Also, the more I glance around on his Wikipedia page there seems to be a few examples of Julain's musicianship, including casio guitar on Queens of the Stone Age's ""Sick, Sick, Sick"", second drums on ""Evening Sun"", and, as you mentioned, the solo on ""Instant Crush"".  If you ask me, the man is a talented musician, and as we already know, a fantastic composer: even for small parts on other people's songs!"
TheStrokes,3d4yna,exoticmess,2,Thu Jul 16 07:41:00 2015 UTC,"Also remember, he wrote basically all the songs for the first 3 albums too, so he's definitely not a bad guitarist."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,AcidOnTheBrain_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:58 2015 UTC,But he also wrote quite a lot of those songs on piano/keyboard.
TheStrokes,3d4yna,greatestape,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well i guess we learn something new everyday."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,AcidOnTheBrain_,2,Wed Jul 15 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Plus, I don't think he's a very good player. There's some videos of him on Youtube that are downright awful.   That's interesting. So he is able to write complex guitar tablature for a lead, rhythm, and a bass, (at least for the first 2-3 albums) but can't actually play what he writes? That's kinda cool, but I don't get it. Shouldn't he couldn't be a really good guitarist to be able to write these songs?"
TheStrokes,3d4yna,Apology_Panda,2,Tue Jul 14 04:02:05 2015 UTC,"he's said that he's pretty good but has just never been good at singing while playing. Also JP Bowersock (a couple of the guys' guitar teacher) worked with him a lot on the guitar portions of the songs. He's listed in the credits of ""is this it?"" as ""the guru"""
TheStrokes,3d4yna,margottenenbaums,2,Tue Jul 14 04:08:20 2015 UTC,ahh gotcha
TheStrokes,3d4yna,Apology_Panda,3,Tue Jul 14 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"Many composers can't play every instrument they write for, it's more based on their knowledge of music theory rather than physically playing it."
TheStrokes,3d4yna,frankenham,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:48:07 2015 UTC,That's why I'd like to get a straight answer as to how much JP helped. I get the feeling he did a lot more than he gets credit for and  should probably have songwriting credits on the first two albums. Even if he just helped with arranging and guitar solos that still counts as writing. That goes for the rest of the band as well.
TheStrokes,3d4yna,greatestape,-6,Tue Jul 14 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"Since his dad owned a modeling agency, Julian had previous experience in that line of work so naturally he had to become the frontman or you might say ""the face of The Strokes"". Seriously though, Julian wrote all the songs, and I think the other guys already knew how to play their instruments, and none of them could sing (sorry Albert) so it kind of fell together I guess."

TheStrokes,3d2lxa,mooninitetwo,3,Tue Jul 14 02:21:03 2015 UTC,God this would be so sick. A more accessible Voidz would be cool.
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,Cuntosaurus,7,Mon Jul 13 22:53:54 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope so. If their next album is anything like their first one, we'd be in for a nice set of songs. :D"
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,Leeman296,3,Mon Jul 13 03:40:38 2015 UTC,Im hoping that there will be new music with the tour but Im sad because Im going to be in Army basic training
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,AcidOnTheBrain_,4,Mon Jul 13 06:54:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully a new style of production. Not so fucking LOUD, but polished. I'd love to hear julian without distortion like FIOE"
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,Cuntosaurus,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:58 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for more songs in the direction of Nintendo Blood.
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,disownedpear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"That did seem like a strong one. The only ones I could do without are the more punk influenced songs. I like Eagles and Business dog alright, but I think they weaken the album"
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,Cuntosaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:27:35 2015 UTC,"No no no no but the distortion and the punk influence is a big part of their aesthetic, i'd hate it if Julian went back to the same polished sound like in FIOE, what's the point of that? He said that Tyranny was a chance for him to showcase the heavy music that he likes, it would suck if he got rid of that influence on the next album just to appease his audience. I think he mentioned in an interview that he wants the next album to be more accessible, which is fine, but the heavy songs must stay"
TheStrokes,3d2lxa,jesuslaves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:46:01 2015 UTC,"You can be aggressive without too much distortion. FIOE, again, is an example. I'm not saying I didn't like that style at all or anything, I just want something different next. Maybe it won't be production, maybe it'll be more like the Stroke's. Who knows."
TheStrokes,3d1sgp,bloodslide,5,Sun Jul 12 20:46:49 2015 UTC,"I want all the videos so bad but I can't get myself to sign up for Tidal. I don't get how Cult can give away the album for $4 and single for 50 cents, yet you have to sign up for tidal to see this. Sad dayz"
TheStrokes,3d1sgp,mocranks,3,Sun Jul 12 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"There is a free trial for tidal. They ask for your credit card, but I think you can cancel at any time before they start billing you. This way you can watch the concert."
TheStrokes,3d1sgp,mocranks,4,Sun Jul 12 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got to the credit card part and just thought that it's not even worth potentially maybe forgetting to cancel it. IDK I'm stubborn"

TheStrokes,3cs1e7,-stoned,16,Fri Jul 10 14:46:41 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive that Julian wrote it. He did most/all of the music for the first 2 or 3 albums I believe.

TheStrokes,3clwfs,50_shades_of_clay,3,Thu Jul 9 02:21:35 2015 UTC,The Nasa spacecraft kind of makes sense because one of his inspirations for his album was Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan so I don't know he might be relating this song to something of that nature.

He wants to sound like he is being straightforward, but with the past news of Strokes being in studio, he sounds disingenuous. I mean, how could he not have a sense of where the Strokes are at? If they got together but nothing gelled creatively, he could say, ""We are working on it, but taking our time."" It's all very confusing, especially since the news of possible new Strokes material came from reputable sources."
TheStrokes,3ckoom,chubacca84,2,Thu Jul 9 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"Here is what would be reassuring to hear, and it doesn't really pressure anyone to say anything they would be uncomfortable with:  Albert: Yeah, we got together in June. Jammed a bit. We're just taking our time and seeing what happens creatively. I'm optimistic, but I can't say where it will take us. At the moment, we're all very busy, so no new Strokes music for the foreseeable future. We'll see."
TheStrokes,3ckoom,Cuntosaurus,5,Thu Jul 9 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"Reading more into the interview, I also get a sense that the Strokes have become such a democratic process that it's not fun creatively for some members. I'm mainly referring to Albert's contribution of ""One Way Trigger"" as a songwriter, and how it became a different song than he imagined. Albert or another band member might bring ideas which they hold dear, and which are very personal to them, but they end up being used as a cog to produce this Strokes-sounding song. As an artist, it probably feels more authentic and fun if you see your whole idea brought to life, rather than a hybrid. The Voidz or AHJ's band enhance the song, while the Strokes create a new song around it. I can kinda see that. This is all my opinion, ofc."
TheStrokes,3ckoom,notjacepeterson,10,Thu Jul 9 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like they're acting like a couple in a romcom, none of them want to say anything official on the record because they don't really know where the others heads are at. Like when the girl and guy both want to be official but won't admit it to each other. Maybe Jules will stand outside Alberts window with a boom box"

TheStrokes,3chbru,RoonilWazilbob,8,Tue Jul 7 22:26:07 2015 UTC,At this point we can only speculate. They haven't signed a new record deal since they completed their RCA contract so right now they don't have to do anything if they don't want to. It's a lot easier and more lucrative for them to play major cities/festivals and let the fans come to them.
TheStrokes,3chbru,greatestape,5,Wed Jul 8 00:03:16 2015 UTC,Closets thing we got: http://www.bmg.com/category/news/?n=us-the-strokes-sign-publishing-deal-with-bmg&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter
TheStrokes,3chbru,fuzzywarmtaco,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would imagine resigning to a major label would be more lucrative. The BMG publishing deal basically means that BMG gets all the dough and I think the band simply gets a percent of the royalties. I'm sure Julian and Albert have money put away, and Nick seems to be doing fine. But I can't imagine playing major shows and festivals being that great in the money department, they have to pay tour managers, roadies, sound guys and whoever is there to help them actually play.   From a business perspective, the Strokes should really sign to a major label. The fact that they haven't yet isn't all that great for a new album. Now we have to wait for Alberts solo gigs, Juliana solo gigs, Nikolais solo gigs to be over for the band to get together for realsies and start talking money/music."
TheStrokes,3chbru,bloodslide,2,Wed Jul 8 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Assuming you maintain the same level of success, you are actually likely to make far more money on an independent label, as you do a lot more of the work yourself. Major labels are like hospitals. They have all of the best amenities possible to aid you, but they nickel and dime you with everything they possibly can. It's a simple matter of the more work you do yourself, the more money you'll make, as long as your stuff is selling and there is demand for you to perform at venues. The fact that only a publishing deal was signed, and not a record deal may be a sign that Julian will release future Strokes music under his label, Cult Records."
TheStrokes,3chbru,ThroatySteak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"True, I agree that on an independent label you could make more money. However, on Cult's website they sell their albums for dirt cheap -- they might as well be giving those things away. I feel like the business aspect on an indie label requires a lot of aggravation, finding what numbers make sense to sell your content, and is basically just a big fucking headache to get shit done in a fiscally responsible way.  However, on a major label, although they may nickel and dime you, shit it very visible. You get music videos done, they promote it until people are sick (although on RCA comedown machine only got internet ads ...), and generally the artists have less of a headache. Even going from a label like Cult to Vagrant (in Albert's case) is a big jump. AHJ has been getting interviews, reviews from the press, live video performances, and there is a sense of the '1975' promotional marketing ploy - all sponsored by Vagrant.  The Strokes'll have to decide what path they choose, a major label, an indie label, I'm sure the subject of Cult will come up - plus I'm sure the question of producers will come up - Gus Oberg, Greg Kurstin, James Murphy, Shawn Everett.  All these questions and more really makes me wonder if the Strokes will ever make new music. I'm sure Fab and Nick actually wanna get this thing going. I'm pretty sure AM was very successful on the indie label Domino, so who knows. Julian's basically paying out of his own pocket with Cult and a Strokes album may not be the best idea. The way I see it is that they'll get exposure on an major label that's not just limited to The UK (where the British press basically suck their dicks) and that way they can actually sell more records (each succeeding album has sold less)."
TheStrokes,3chbru,bloodslide,6,Thu Jul 9 05:19:05 2015 UTC,Tour? Yes.  Album? I don't think so.  I hope I'm wrong.
TheStrokes,3chbru,aMartin3105,2,Wed Jul 8 09:32:38 2015 UTC,"They will do more festivals. You HAVE TO see them at a festival if you want to see them anymore. I saw them at ACL 5 years ago and now will see them at ACL this year. I don't think they have played a regular show near me since 2006. It always kinda blows cause like at least half the people there don't give a shit or are too drunk to give a shit. The Strokes are still amazing though even with all the annoyances it is totally worth it.   I still have hope that they will make another album. Might be pointless. But honestly I am happy as long as Julian is still making music, doesn't really matter the moniker."
TheStrokes,3chbru,kekewewe,4,Wed Jul 8 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"In the near future I can't see a tour. I think they'll play a bunch of festival shows here and there during summer, like they have been doing so far this year"

People think I’m lying but I’m just tired of trying to make some positive spin, but I’ve got no idea. So I take each one like it’s my last and I hold and I cherish it.   Source: http://www.stereogum.com/1806310/dont-expect-more-tour-dates-or-new-music-from-the-strokes-anytime-soon/news/  I believe him.

TheStrokes,3caqcd,BentOnSimon,10,Mon Jul 6 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"I think Amir's title as ""guitar anti-hero"" is just a riff on the Guitar Hero segments that were played.   And as far as I can tell...  Jeff is reminiscing on old memories, first with the childhood photos of himself, then of an old girlfriend and possibly a prescription drug addiction.   Alex seems to be remembering his childhood with his abusive father, and he is trying to drown those memories with alcohol before getting kicked out onto the street.   Beardo is in some sort of depressed state where he is surrounding himself with strippers/dancers whatever in an attempt to...feel pleasure again? I don't know, but he seems to be emotionally dead while it is happening.   Jake is having flashbacks to the war where he lost his friend (Beardo).   I'm not really sure what Julian is doing at the store. At some point he reminisces memories of being with his wife on the beach.   Amir seems to be in more of a fantasy than a memory, as he plays the guitar solo in a hurricane on a mountaintop.   The common theme is that they use the white glasses to relive prior experiences. At the end we see Julian about to remove these glasses and perhaps face the world for what it is (post-apocalyptic wasteland), but he decides to keep them on because the old memories are more appealing I guess."
TheStrokes,3caqcd,julaincasablanco,4,Mon Jul 6 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I used to work grave yard shift at a gastation, and the one Julian was in reminded me of it. Let me tell you something, the level of depression and worthlessness you feel when working at one of those places is extremely depressing. That scene really brought me back. Seeing Julian stocking the sodas really hit me hard, and I feel like a lot of people won't understand that. That, to me, was Human Sadness.   Although, I doubt Julian's intentions were there for me, or anyone, to feel like that when he filmed it. I doubt Julian had ever worked at one of those."
TheStrokes,3caqcd,50_shades_of_clay,2,Tue Jul 7 01:22:39 2015 UTC,He actually said in an interview that that feeling was exactly what he was going for with his scene. It's supposed to be about working at a job you hate just to survive and the flashbacks of him on the beach are I guess to show the happiness in his life since everyone's story line showed at least one part with them happy.

I've also notice that the first riff and drum line of Ize and Life is Simple are similar (Not completely the same). Same kind of rhythm, I think the lyrics even come in at the same time. Very interesting, to me."

The end has no end  Then play 12:51, hard to explain and take it or leave it  Then play soma, barely legal, someday. Here it gets tricky, because their first album is essentially an amazingly flowing strokes playlist anyways. As a matter of fact, each individual album is a strokes playlist, each has their own signature sound-theme.  Then I would pair, Ask me Anything with 80s a comedown machine  Then I would pair 50/50 with New York City Cops  Then I would play, all the time, juice box then ize of the world..."

If you can find this, which keeps getting taken down by youtube, there is a lot of ball-busting and julian is drunk, but he reveals a lot of info about what it was like to be with his biological father.  http://www.gq.com/story/julian-casablancas  Above (in the link) is an interview with more info on his father, a subject that definitely informs Julian.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da6ujDj6ix8&list=PLh-UiDjc-iAvKIA3FwJ3bV9MQ8i17QMe5   (part 1)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa9ezae2AYw&index=2&list=PLh-UiDjc-iAvKIA3FwJ3bV9MQ8i17QMe5  (part 2)  The two video interviews above talk about the songwriting process. Julian writes all the music, and the important part is when he says ""we try really hard to make things spontaneous, but the musical composition is actually very though out"". JP bowersock composes the guitar solos with Julian   http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/julian-casablancas-radical-reinvention-20141015  The above is an article on his mythical-artsy stepfather  http://www.mtvhive.com/2011/03/22/the-strokes-angles-paradox/  this article is about retro culture and the strokes  http://maybeyoulivetwice.noisey.com/  This article is just a good read. He says at one point ""The Strokes was my life"" - I liked that. also good info on other band members and their problems.  Also, there is a Nardwar interview on youtube which show the bands attitude towards the press very well. In hindsight, everything Julian says in this video was truthful, even though people at the time probably bought into the whole ""the strokes will save rock 'n roll"" shtick.  Here is an interview between Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwomen and Julian of the Strokes. Talks a bit about the status of the Strokes as the top NY band in all of the clubs  http://www.timeout.com/newyork/music/julian-casablancas-and-karen-o-interview-each-other  http://www.nme.com/photos/30-things-you-never-knew-about-the-strokes/121946#/photo/23  Here is a list by NME. Some of it is tabloid-y bullshit, but some is interesting. Le Rosey is topic worth looking into."

TheStrokes,3bzfu8,TheRentIsTooDamnHi,3,Fri Jul 3 20:05:56 2015 UTC,Here's the Howard Stern interview...apologize for the source
TheStrokes,3bzfu8,Wingzerofyf,3,Sat Jul 4 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"Know this post is a few days old but wanna throw another one in, a rare gem maybe, that OP may consider of interest. It's a BBC doc called Meet me in the bathroom coming off the tail end of the ITI tour right on the day they played Radio City Music Hall. Along with interviews with the boyz, it also has interviews with Ryan, JP, Jack White, Noel Gallagher, and many others, a really cool documentary that doesn't get the exposure it should."
TheStrokes,3bzfu8,iimalteaserii,3,Mon Jul 6 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome man, can't wait to see listen to it :)"

TheStrokes,3bzfu8,greatestape,2,Fri Jul 3 19:13:16 2015 UTC,...is this a hypothetical question or one of those 'Unauthorized' biography things?
TheStrokes,3bzfu8,Walksonthree,12,Fri Jul 3 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, not hypothetical. I'm making it for the BBC."
TheStrokes,3bzfu8,greatestape,16,Fri Jul 3 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"In that case...  People that worked with the band:   Manager: Ryan Gentles Producer: Gordon Raphael Guitar teacher: JP Bowersock  Roadie/tech/friend: Matt Romano Colin Lane: Tour photographer Roman Coppola: Directed the Is This It music videos and the MTV $2 Bill concert. Assistant manager: Juliet Casablancas   Bands that were fans, were influenced by, or played with the Strokes:   Arctic Monkeys The Libertines Kings of Leon The Killers Doves Guided By Voices Noel Gallagher Ryan Adams Karen O   I think your best bet is to contact Ryan Gentles first and see who would be willing to talk. I think it's pretty unlikely that you'll get the band all in one room for an interview, but it's not beyond the realm of possibility that they would do individual interviews."

TheStrokes,3bw1t5,CommanderPaprika,4,Fri Jul 3 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yep I'm in the same boat, if you subscribe to the ACL email thing I'm pretty sure they're gonna release the schedule and you can make sure you don't miss out on the tickets."

TheStrokes,3bw1t5,bryu_1337,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Hi, I live about 3 & half hours from Austin. Every Strokes or Julian Casablancas appearance I've ever been to has been in Austin. I was going to buy the 3 day pass but I was not really interested in the other two headliners so I am taking my chances & hoping I can land single day tickets for The Strokes headliner. I also don't mind waiting in line especially since its my favorite band. I waited to see The Voidz for nearly 5 hours back in SXSW but didn't make it in but I did snap a pick with Albert Hammond Jr who was just walking by. When the Voidz came back in October I believe, I took a pic with Julian & it was the 3rd greats day of my life."
TheStrokes,3bw1t5,ZeroCO01,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:41:16 2015 UTC,I will be there! Will probably be willing to wait  for front row too. I did the wait at shaky knees earlier this year and it was well worth it.
TheStrokes,3bs712,3mbryo,3,Wed Jul 1 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but I see they added CTL. Maybe people notice that the playlist isn't working, then they see something new, and listen to that. They get paid on plays so this might just be a way to get some plays for him."
TheStrokes,3bs712,bigks0n,2,Wed Jul 1 19:31:14 2015 UTC,I've never seen the album on Spotify :/
TheStrokes,3bs712,slbto24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:55 2015 UTC,I did like a year or two back. I got sad when I wanted to listen to In Transit and it wasn't on there

TheStrokes,3bs712,pottrpupptpals,3,Thu Jul 2 03:57:23 2015 UTC,What exactly makes it a better service than spotify? Aside from the fact that it has this album of course
TheStrokes,3bs712,jahkillinem,2,Thu Jul 2 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"The desktop integration is way better, you have the option to stream at a higher bitrate (better quality), the radio service is wayyyyyy better and more useful, and the song selection is vaster."
TheStrokes,3bs712,pottrpupptpals,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"How is the mobile service though? Because I can listen to whatever I want however I want pretty much for free on desktop, but is the mobile version as good as Spotify."
TheStrokes,3bs712,jahkillinem,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Mobile is better. If you have an Android phone, which is made by Google, the integration is leagues ahead of Spotify"

TheStrokes,3bqrjg,AcidOnTheBrain_,15,Wed Jul 1 21:19:15 2015 UTC,Metabolism from the angles album is never mentioned much but it's one of my top songs
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,Cuntosaurus,5,Wed Jul 1 16:02:07 2015 UTC,Reminds me of muse!
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,julaincasablanco,10,Thu Jul 2 05:34:28 2015 UTC,When It Started. It has such a cool drum hook and beat. The way Julian delivers is so hype. Like how chill the chorus is.  I get tired of NYCC easily.
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,-Suriyel-,5,Wed Jul 1 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. When it Started is probably one of my favourite Strokes songs. The lyrics and melody just have this carefree vibe with a subtle melancholy underneath it. Plus I just love the line ""I don't care, I don't care cuz it's free"" and the riff that immediately follows."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,Cuntosaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one, especially the 2 dollar bill version, I still get chills/hyped listening to it. I've always been a little puzzled by the lyrics though. What is this song really about?"
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,fat_over_lean,2,Sun Jul 5 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly, but a few standout likes are:  ""Anything they wanted  They could have it  Didn't even notice  I don't mind it""  And the closing lines  ""Come on, tell me, does she warm the room when he comes  Or does he just know how to leave when it gets cold?  I don't care cause it's free.""  Probably the most underrated Strokes lyrics ^  I think it could be about a guy who has it all and a great woman and uses her for sex. And is abusive."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,AcidOnTheBrain_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:03:07 2015 UTC,"""Loves his job / Takes it home"" always stood out to me, which could have abusive undertones depending on what his ""job"" is."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,AcidOnTheBrain_,8,Tue Jul 7 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"I love Meet Me in the Bathroom, I find the lyrics and meaning to be amazing.  It's tough for me to choose an overhyped song, as I really don't have anything I dislike. Juicebox doesn't do much for me, but I think that's because the video was so weird."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,wirral_riddler,5,Wed Jul 1 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"Meet Me in the Bathroom is top tier on ROF, I have no idea how 12:51 and The End Has No End became singles while songs like it, Between Love and Hate, and I Can't Win got ignored."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,AcidOnTheBrain_,10,Wed Jul 1 17:41:24 2015 UTC,I think 12:51 was a great choice
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,SoaringMuse,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:44:25 2015 UTC,And it's not a bad song by any means but it feels kind of overhyped
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,SoaringMuse,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:05:10 2015 UTC,"You tend to get that with singles, but I think reptilia was also a great choice for a single"
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,ahhtasha,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"Reptilia was easily ""the"" song from ROF in terms of popularity. I think ROF is the only album in which one song is generally far and away more popular than the rest."
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,roomonfire26,7,Tue Jul 7 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"15 Minutes is criminally underrated, and I just don't appreciate Last Nite."

TheStrokes,3bqrjg,Mahacksh,2,Fri Jul 3 05:15:37 2015 UTC,It's got a really unique sound that seems a little darker than most of ITI and ROF but not quite as dark as some of FIOE. I watched Jorge Orellana's video on it and was blown away by how awesome just the guitar parts on it are.
TheStrokes,3bqrjg,jw_94,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:10:19 2015 UTC,"Trying Your Luck has been my favorite song from ITI for the last 14 years (at one point tied with Hard to Explain). so good, so raw."

TheStrokes,3bk890,SkyFall96,3,Mon Jun 29 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"Big fan of this one too, I'm really excited for all this to go down :)"
TheStrokes,3bccj9,bloodslide,29,Sat Jun 27 21:41:17 2015 UTC,I think they had a looooot of those conversations over the years. Probably didn't help when half of them had alcohol and drug problems. The dynamic in the band had always been a bit mysterious to me.. Especially post-Angles. I know they're friendly to each other and all but it seems more like the kind of friendly you are with an old ex.. A more superficial kind of bond. Because the deeper bond didn't work out.
TheStrokes,3bccj9,tinewashere,5,Sat Jun 27 23:39:00 2015 UTC,Nailed it
TheStrokes,3bccj9,kaleidoscope_ize,4,Sun Jun 28 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%, however it does seem like there's less tension on stage these days. I'd like to think things have been patched up, if not in the process of doing so."
TheStrokes,3bccj9,SirFadakar,20,Sun Jun 28 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"I feel as if they were arguing over Julian's possessive and over controlling nature as a frontman.   Am I the only one who thinks it might be the other way around? to me it sounds like Julian would like the rest of the band to be more involved in some decision/process and Nikolai is like ""there's no point because you'll end up having the best ideas""."
TheStrokes,3bccj9,orlondow,6,Sun Jun 28 06:07:02 2015 UTC,No Julian's always been very meticulous when it comes to crafting music. Even with the Voidz Yamir was mentioned to be one of the most hard headed people when it came to constructing music but during one of the Voidz promos Yamir spoke about how he had never met someone so punctual when it came to sound (in regards to Julian). I'm paraphrasing ofc but it's no secret that Julian is very anal when it comes to a song sounding the way he thinks it should sound
TheStrokes,3bccj9,kaleidoscope_ize,6,Sun Jun 28 21:07:13 2015 UTC,I read it as Nikolai saying Julian always ends up thinking his ideas are best and won't budge. But hey it worked out for them for a very long time

TheStrokes,3bccj9,Aceilvi,4,Sun Jun 28 03:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is an old interview and it's widely known that julian wrote all of the music back then, so it's hard to say if julian is encouraging them to be more proactive in the band or if they're saying he is the strong headed one. But if julian is telling the truth about the angles recordings, then id say he was trying to get them to join him in songwriting"

TheStrokes,3bccj9,lmiyagi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Well, at first, the general consensus was that julian largely separated himself from the band during recording, supposedly in an attempt to make them contribute a greater amount to the music. I believe it was nick who was largely vocally opposed to this move. During press for the voidz, julian countered that assumption by stating plainly that they were all present, to which the other band members did back pedal a bit."

TheStrokes,3b9q0l,HypnoHipster,9,Sat Jun 27 03:36:37 2015 UTC,He reminds me of Jack White haha. It's pretty awesome though
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,AcidOnTheBrain_,5,Sat Jun 27 04:56:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm digging the red jumpsuit too. Reminds me of Mick Jones from The Clash.

It looks so classy... kind of Napoleonic in a sense. I just love it.  EDIT: Shout out to Julian the gas station attendant, as well as This performance of Gratisfaction on Ellen. The whole band was on point here (especially Nikolai!)"
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,Interpolice,5,Sat Jun 27 03:36:47 2015 UTC,His marine corp jacket from 2$ bill is so badass!

TheStrokes,3b9q0l,fagdrew4l,5,Sat Jun 27 08:06:27 2015 UTC,Black leather jackets with a black hoodie underneath and black jeans.
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,maliamer04,15,Sat Jun 27 13:01:19 2015 UTC,Julian's garbage man (?) outfit is definitely a favorite of mine.
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,smokeycuntz,2,Sat Jun 27 03:49:27 2015 UTC,It was actually an FC Barcelona away shirt :p
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,Walksonthree,11,Sat Jun 27 09:29:56 2015 UTC,I think he was referring to Julian's actual 'US Garbage Collector' shirt.
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,waifsandmendicants,7,Sat Jun 27 10:31:18 2015 UTC,Definitely Julian's Let's Dance jacket. That thing looks insanely good.

TheStrokes,3b9q0l,cmonnats,10,Mon Jun 29 03:17:39 2015 UTC,First thing that came to mind was what he wore for boombox. I liked the whole tight jeans leather jacket thing he had a lot more than his style now. Also his hair was at its best at that point in time. Glasses tied the whole thing up real nice. I suppose I'm probably biased since it was my first time learning about JC after listening to the strokes for several year before that without knowing anything about them
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,ActuallyIsBrayden,13,Sat Jun 27 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"what he wore   Bruh, everyone was wearing fingerless gloves."
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,maliamer04,5,Sat Jun 27 12:58:36 2015 UTC,"Julian's double denim Voidz look. I'm pretty sure only he could pull it off and look as awesome as he did.  Shoutout to Nikolai's entirely white suit too, it's ridiculously cool."
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,bizdog,5,Sat Jun 27 12:43:25 2015 UTC,Julian in Boombox That feathered hair is just unreal
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,pottrpupptpals,4,Sat Jun 27 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"Always been surprised that Julian's military jacket from the MTV 2002 concert didn't become iconic for him rather than the whole 'skinny jeans and converse' thing.  There's also his all-blue ensemble from the Last Nite video.  The gig bracelets are what makes it.  Nick's white blazer and orange shirt from the MTV concert are killer.  Nikolai has always been kind of funny-looking, but I liked his leather jacket from the Is This It period  Albert might be the most stylish of them all.  I'm partial to this suit.  Finally there's Fab, who tends to only t-shirts and jeans, but he's looking pretty good here"

TheStrokes,3b9q0l,Sadsharks,3,Sat Jun 27 20:05:26 2015 UTC,Julian's Phrazes/11th Dimension era was probably his best and prime in my opinion. His style was pretty slick and avante garde with that leather military red collar jacket
TheStrokes,3b9q0l,FIDLAAR,2,Mon Jun 29 03:11:09 2015 UTC,Forgot to mention Julian's white suit jacket with a red star from the Last Nite (VHQ) video.
TheStrokes,3b9p56,HypnoHipster,9,Sat Jun 27 03:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a really big fan of Albert's song Scared from the album Yours to Keep. Fun fact, Julian actually did background vocals for that song."
TheStrokes,3b9p56,Finial,4,Sat Jun 27 04:11:34 2015 UTC,That's neat to know. I like how some songs have similar riffs to some of The Strokes's songs.

TheStrokes,3b9p56,HumanSaddness,7,Sat Jun 27 12:51:24 2015 UTC,"Yes! Great stuff, I've found myself listening to more AHJ and JC+Voidz lately. That's not to say I don't care for The Strokes; just a phase I suppose."
TheStrokes,3b9p56,HumanSaddness,6,Sat Jun 27 04:18:53 2015 UTC,I only liked a few songs from Tyranny but it's crazy to see how much different music Julian can make. Johan Von Bronx and Human Sadness are my favorites off that album.
TheStrokes,3b9p56,SoaringMuse,2,Sat Jun 27 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"Heh, as per my username, you can see I also am a fan of Human Sadness. Probably my favorite song at the moment. The video is just abstractly beautiful. I'm not even sure what I'm looking at in some points.   Business Dog and Crunch Punch are great."

Personally I liked Julian's first album ""Phrazes"", it was easier to listen to and ease into whereas Voidz was just too weird for my tastes and harder & slower (burn) to ease into (only liked/enjoyed three songs).   Hey its like the saying goes: ""Different strokes for different folks."" Thats my take on it though, no offense to any fans of The Voidz."
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,SirFadakar,7,Mon Jun 22 07:34:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and his Voidz album might be my favorite thing he's ever released.  Phrazes was so fucking great. Tyranny was so fucking great. I can't wait for what's next."
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,FIDLAAR,5,Mon Jun 22 08:37:17 2015 UTC,"I am just very psyche about new Strokes album. I really dig the 80s/New Wave-ness vibe of Comedown Machine (not a lot of people like it and were pretty torn by it) but personally for me I love New Wave Strokes. I know of many people that listen exclusively to The Strokes only for their first two albums as their New Wave sound from Angles & Comedown Machine doesnt suit their tastes (or sound different from their original sound) or it deters them from enjoying their new sound.  Its as if they are progressing from an era: 70s garage rock Strokes (Is This It & Room on Fire) to 80s New Wave Strokes (Angles & Comedown Machine).   What's next? 90s grunge, expansion of the New Wave sound, Post-Punk, or something??"
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,FIDLAAR,3,Mon Jun 22 08:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I can definitely see how his new stuff isn't for everyone. I don't understand it myself, but I am not into harder music in general."
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,FIDLAAR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:43:17 2015 UTC,What do you mean by harder? Harder music like metal or harder to burn?
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,FIDLAAR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:45:51 2015 UTC,Like metal.
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,cinderwild2323,3,Mon Jun 22 07:47:24 2015 UTC,"I think is a mix and matter of personal taste of what music you like, background (like parents listen to his music back then), friends, and then progression.  For me I never liked metal and it was really hardcore for more and vocals were satanic. Now I sorta like various and some metal music. How so? I had to ease in to hard music from slow to music to hard (soft rock - punk - faster rock - speed metal). To put it simply, I really digged the adrenaline/intensity of punk music and the fast pace of it. Started with FIDLAR then Ramones and then some harder punk music and soon I loved the fast pace of it and eased into the faster side of metal: speed metal."
TheStrokes,3aoqgk,BioSpock,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:53:21 2015 UTC,I have sensory issues and harder music has always been super grating for me. But I am super picky about everything.. not because I have good taste or anything but that's just how I am. That's why I am such a big Julian fan though because he's the only person who I have liked so much of what they do. Even his harder stuff I like more than most.
TheStrokes,3ahctt,Aceilvi,3,Sat Jun 20 04:46:08 2015 UTC,These tioli solos these past shows have been the best I've ever heard.

TheStrokes,3ae3bx,Ammarzk,4,Fri Jun 19 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Got goosebumps when this started. I'd gotten out of the (insane) pit and was actually feeling not quite in the zone because of how much energy I'd used up trying not to get crushed. This, my 'go to' Strokes tune sorted me right out. I'm a 23 year old bloke and it almost brought me to tears. Such a brilliant gig, glad for everyone who managed to make it. The guys didn't disappoint."
TheStrokes,3ae3bx,AJGibbo,2,Fri Jun 19 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, they didn't disappoint. The pits were insane I lasted one song and decided I wanted out. About tears being brought to your eyes the whole gig was that way for me, just having all these random people belting out the lyrics and the one thing that connects you is the strokes, it's beautiful. Sorry I am rambling and I am slightly tipsy."
TheStrokes,3ae3bx,ProjectPoltergeist,3,Sat Jun 20 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I've seen them perform twice, 2011 and last August. Jules' stage presence with the strokes was shit. I saw him perform with the voidz the night before the strokes in August and later in November and he was a completely different person on stage.  Seems like it's leaking back to the strokes. I love it."
TheStrokes,3ae3bx,SirFadakar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yes good observation! Julian definitely seems to be enjoying himself more, the whole band from what I saw, it's brilliant that the voidz have got his musical juices going again. Fingers crossed this means the strokes start making some new music."

TheStrokes,3ac7c0,BioSpock,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:50:36 2015 UTC,Yeah the mosh pits did suck they definetly got more reception from the is this it songs then comedown machine.

TheStrokes,39q5b7,barkruffalo,21,Sat Jun 13 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely think that removing it from the US release was the right call.  Could you imagine the backlash when the song is heard after 9/11?  News stations would call the Strokes unpatriotic.  Remember what happened to the Dixie Chicks when they said something bad about Bush?  It would be surrounded in controversy, and while it may have given them publicity, it probably wouldn't have been good publicity, even if the song was written and recorded before 9/11.  I definitely think it doesn't fit really well, but Someday doesn't fit that well either.  The entire album is about sex and not giving a fuck, and Someday has a very different feel.  As for When It Started, I like it, but not as much as NYC Cops, it lacks the same feel of Is This It, much like Someday."
TheStrokes,39q5b7,PSkip,9,Sat Jun 13 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"I agree on removing it   9/11 was a really important deal back then and sometimes even now. People would have taken major offense to it if it was left on even though the song was written before anything happened.  As for when it started, I think I like it more than NYC cops for the rhythm. It's very chill especially in the chorus as opposed to NYC cops which has more of a heavy feel to it which is good sometimes but for that particular album felt a little too much   When it started went great with it"
TheStrokes,39q5b7,RadioactiveRetard,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everything you said. Also I love the way says ""I don't care because it's free"""
TheStrokes,39q5b7,BioSpock,5,Fri Jun 19 01:56:52 2015 UTC,It was obviously a good decision yo take it off because it would have been pretty disrespectful to go with it. Watch Nikolai talk about it in the top ten Strokes songs NME video.
TheStrokes,39q5b7,Walksonthree,5,Sat Jun 13 18:15:56 2015 UTC,"New York City Cops is my favourite Strokes song. I agree with their decision, but as a fan from Scotland I'm very glad it didn't carry across the pond."
TheStrokes,39q5b7,MattN92,4,Sat Jun 13 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"As /u/PSkip said, had it been on ITI they would have been vilified. As for the song, especially considering today's times with Baltimore and the increasingly ""Shoot first"" behavior of the US police force, that song really stands out. As for the album itself, I always saw ""When it started"" as the standalone of the album. I think it's cause the US vinyl release, (with the particle collision cover they chose to change, and NYCC still on it cause it went to pressing before 9/11) is what I think of when I think of ITI."
TheStrokes,39q5b7,Wingzerofyf,6,Sat Jun 13 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"As a listener who originally listened to ""The Strokes"" on Pandora and only heard their tracks as singles, I had no idea ""New York City Cops"" was not released on CD in America or that there was a secondary album cover for international releases until relatively recently.   This perspective has made me appreciate every song on ""Is This It?"" separately as well as made me appreciate it more as a whole. Though, looking back at it, from a musical point of view ""New York City Cops"" doesn't flow at all and should have closed the album instead. ""When it started"" is a much more fitting track for the album as one cohesive work of art as it carries on the much brighter sound that the rest of the album embodies beautifully. I prefer the American release (I regularly listen to both) for casual listening because of this.   ""New York City Cops"" is a fantastic song, and I would probably argue that it is a better song than ""When It Started,"" when it comes to individual appeal. But when a rough, loud, and honestly--shallow song like ""New York City Cops"" is sandwiched between a sharp and thoughtfully delivered song like ""Hard To Explain"" and the more mellow and profound ""Trying Your Luck"" it loses so much of its potency and just takes me, at least, away from the music and into my own head.  (The American track list and the international cover is the perfect ""Is This It"" release)"
TheStrokes,39q5b7,frostbyrne,2,Sun Jun 14 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"I couldn't have said it better myself. I don't know if I worded my question poorly (likely) but everyone else doesn't seem to think it would stick out from the rest of the album like a sore thumb. ""When It Started"" keeps the flow much better, as you mentioned."

YES I'MMM LEAVIN). NYC Cops is not out of place on the album, with tracks like Take It Or Leave It closing it out."
TheStrokes,39q5b7,greatestape,2,Sun Jun 14 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody would've noticed. Nobody in America knew who the fuck the Strokes were at that point and if anything controversy would've sold more records. I think it was probably the right decision but to me ITI with NYCC is the real album. When It Started is a sick tune, however."

TheStrokes,39nhvl,Vewdew_Child,8,Sat Jun 13 05:21:39 2015 UTC,"Idk why people are hating, I for one really like The Voidz versions of the songs. Even if they don't turn out perfect, it's always interesting to hear a different spin on them. Also it's not like Julian plays them with some kind of animosity towards The Strokes or hams the entire setlist with them, The Voidz only have one album out so it makes sense if they'd want to switch it up a little. They used to play Instant Crush in the beginning, still play some songs from Phrazes, and Little Girl recently so it's the same thing if they included 1 or 2 Strokes songs at a time, it's cool."

TheStrokes,39nhvl,mooninitetwo,6,Sat Jun 13 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Julian is 100% writer of those songs. It's his decision to do what he wants with them.

It's odd that Strokes fans would be butthurt about Julian playing Strokes stuff with the Voidz, even though Julian is the main Stroke."
TheStrokes,39nhvl,owennerd123,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"If Julian had recorded everything by himself I wouldn't have a problem with it, but the performances on the records are just as important as the writing itself.

I think it was a real treat and surprise for the fans in the audience that heard ""Ize"" played at our show. I really never expected to hear it live and it was an awesome experience. Also, the songs he picks, whether off Phrazes or whatever, tend to follow the mood of Tyranny. Personally, I think it's awesome to her those songs performed and I'm not sure why some people are annoyed by it, all in all it was an awesome experience."

TheStrokes,396e1f,darwinw,12,Tue Jun 9 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows, the only person dropping hints is Albert. After releasing his previous album on Cult Records (Julian's label) he released his follow-up on something else, sparking rumors of tension. He downplayed these of course, but the recently was making vague statements which fans are taking as things being done with The Strokes, even touring.   When asked by BBC 6 Music if the band were writing new songs, Hammond replied: ""No. I don't even know if we're going to play any more shows...I don't know if London might be our last show, you know what I mean? People think I'm lying but I'm just tired of trying to make some positive spin, but I've got no idea. So I take each one like it's my last and I hold and I cherish it."""
TheStrokes,396e1f,fat_over_lean,3,Tue Jun 9 17:00:16 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any idea why he's saying it might be the end?
TheStrokes,396e1f,fat_over_lean,8,Tue Jun 9 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"They had trouble in the past, creative differences. IIRC there was talk that they didn't even record Angles together, Julian did his vocals without them, but I think that was overblown.   They never did a real tour for Comedown Machine because of the tension from Angles (but they needed to fulfill their contract with RCA). They've been at it for the past year doing festivals, and seemed to be enjoying it (I was at Gov Ball last summer, they were smiling like crazy, a stark change from recent live clips). People have been saying they've been writing new stuff, but then suddenly we got all these weird rumors and mysterious social media posts.  EDIT: Fixed some grammar & clarified a bit."
TheStrokes,396e1f,bryu_1337,6,Tue Jun 9 17:15:40 2015 UTC,Julian said that they in fact did record angles together and that anyone saying otherwise was incorrect in their remembrance of the sessions
TheStrokes,396e1f,RichardMagpies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Then you're calling Nikolai a liar because he was extremely unhappy with how Angles was recorded; all of them together producing the whole album, and Julian being present for about 20% of it. The rest was vocals emailed over to them."
TheStrokes,396e1f,bryu_1337,3,Wed Jun 10 15:23:08 2015 UTC,Lol I'm not calling anyone a liar. I'm just repeating what julian said when asked about it before the shows last year and during voidz press
TheStrokes,396e1f,Fuser55,4,Wed Jun 10 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything about the band breaking up exactly. This article says that JC stated that the Strokes were already in the process of recording/writing, if not at least beginning to. The stuff that /u/fat_over_lean mentioned was unknown to me before now, but honestly, it sounds similar to the article that was posted here before about how Julian doesn't ""feel"" anything when performing with the band. Maybe we're taking AHJ's words out of proportion or interpreting them wrong.   We have to remember that the band is now over a decade old, of course there will be some fighting or loss of motivation/inspiration. At least there is no direct harm to any of the band members as the addiction drama has now ceased, so the only thing standing in the way of new music is probably creative differences.  That being said, the band members really like their solo stuff. Albert's solo work has been extremely successful and it sounds great. His solo work sounds more like the Strokes than Julian's work, which sounds more electric and indie-ish (?). You can see where Angles got its unique sound from even though all band members contributed. Even Nikolia and Fab have their own solo stuff although I've heard none of it, and I've heard nothing of Nick lately.   With AHJ releasing Momentary Masters soon and already announcing tour dates, its doubtful that we get any new Strokes material in the next year or so, maybe a single already recorded? However, after that, since JC already released Tyranny, we'll probably see more recording action soon since everyone will have been done working on their solo work.  Edit: doubt-ful"
TheStrokes,396e1f,greatestape,4,Tue Jun 9 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"They signed a publishing deal last year to take care of their RCA catalog, but as of right now they haven't signed a new record deal which means on a business level they aren't required to do anything if they don't want to. It also means that the band is operating on their own cash flow. If they want to pay a producer to make a new record then that's coming out of their own pocket. Same thing with studio fees and touring costs.   Should they release new material the obvious thing would be to release it on Cult, but it's unclear whether or not the label could handle it. From what I've heard Julian is running the label out of his own pocket and it's not like they're doing a ton of business.  The Strokes have played one-off shows and several festivals since last summer and they seem to be content doing that for now. All we can do is hope for new material."
TheStrokes,396e1f,thegreyicewater,3,Wed Jun 10 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"As rad as Cult is, I don't think they have the capabilities or resources to handle a major record release that a Strokes album would require.  It took forever for Cult to release the Tyranny vinyl. Cult runs on a really tight budget thats funded out of Julian's pocket, and I'm betting Cult has just a handful of fulltime employees and a bunch of interns.  Cult can for sure run their Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr/Facebook pages really well, but there's a lot more logistical work required to handle a major release.  And I think this is precisely why Albert went to another label for his new album- not because of any personal tension with Julian, but he just really wants a label that has more cash on hand to push his album wider and bigger than Cult can."
TheStrokes,396e1f,greatestape,3,Wed Jun 10 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think Cult can handle it to be honest. Even if they record at Albert's house they still have to pay a producer and have the record mixed and mastered. Plus then it really becomes a conflict of interest as Julian would actually be The Strokes' boss. I'm guessing they'll do what Radiohead does now. They record with their own money, retain ownership of the recordings and then license the album to various labels in different territories. That way Cult could handle the US release and then other labels could handle stuff overseas and what not. Sounds like the way to go if you ask me."
TheStrokes,396e1f,childishrambin0,2,Wed Jun 10 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"I swear I saw an article on Rolling Stone earlier this year saying that Julian said that The Strokes were writing/getting ready to write new material for their possible sixth album, but I'm not sure if that was true... After Albert did that interview for BBC 6, a lot of fans were afraid this might be the end for them but he then took to Twitter to say that they had just misconstrued the information. To me, there seems to be little tension, if any, between The Strokes (a photo surfaced on the Internet of Julian and Albert laughing together and joking around at Primavera, some of them still hang out even when they're not working together). However, I've noticed that a lot of people have said Julian looks a lot happier doing shows with The Voidz than he does with The Strokes, which is understandable since I can see why he would get tired of singing the same songs for 10 years (UCOD, anyone?). Hopefully these are all just misunderstandings and The Strokes release new music soon, but right now all we have are these summer festivals."

TheStrokes,3942y2,Taderchip,8,Tue Jun 9 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"The song ""I Miss The Dog The Most,"" I'm listening to it right now. The song is missing bass - do you have a bass player? If yes, bring it out - if no, maybe make the rhythm guitar a little lower, also, speaking of guitars, maybe tighten up the rhythm a little bit? I appreciate the garage rock sound, and that probably wasn't 100% on purpose, but every once and a while the song kind of falls apart. But, the song gets back up and works again.I liked when it was built up at the end, maybe make it a little rougher by adding some cymbal crashes. Oh there's the bass! The last beat!  Now, I'm listening to ""Lately."" Neat little guitar intro, maybe make the guitar tone a little stronger. I like the rhytm but bring it out some more... Again, no bass? I like the simple drum beat. I find myself tapping my feet. Oh, nice chorus. The rhythm after in between lyrics is a little off, work on that a bit. I feel like these songs could benefit from being sped up a little bit. They're some nice chill songs, though. I like them and will probably download them because this is kind of my style. I like the vocals on both songs, no complaints there - or suggestions really. Again, this chorus is really cool, but the instrumentals between vocals need tightening! These songs are ok, but some tightening up could really be beneficial! Shameless plug, but I followed you on soundcloud, Clangster, would appreciate some feedback as well (: The guitar solo is ok. I like the little block sound that came in during it, the drummer has some good rhythm here. Or, who ever is doing it. So, that ending was very nice! Appreciatee that!  Now here is ""Take Me Home,"" This intro is very calming and lullaby like. The vocals are a little off key every few words. Well, they were at first, but it's pretty relaxing. In this song, the vocals will need to be brought out and the drum needs to pushed back a little. Start them off how they were, bring them back once the band comes in. I can kind of hear the bass in this one, but it should be brought out. A strong bass line could go a long way in a slow song like this. A strong bass line could go far in any song. This song is very catchy, the vocals come out every one and a while when he gets a little more into it, but I wish they were that volume. I like this guitar solo. Simple. Relaxing. This song is very catchy and has potential. I wish the ending had a little more, but no complaining for me.   I liked Lately and loved Take Me Home, but The Dog left a lot to be desired! Keep it up though, you guys are just starting. A lot of potential hear, can't wait to hear more and this really brings me back!"
TheStrokes,3942y2,50_shades_of_clay,2,Tue Jun 9 03:09:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the feedback! I definitely hear what you mean about the bass needing to be more front and center and I'll make sure to work on the production next time as well as tightening up the groves and beats.

TheStrokes,3942y2,TakinR,5,Wed Jun 10 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"Your vocalist has a really interesting style imo. Kind of a ""lazy"" voice but with a touch of Jazz/Blues. He should definitely be the focus in your songs, or at least be the focus in this song specifically. Try to make his voice stand out more by having the instruments (esp rythm guitar and lead guitar) be more harmonic (lead was sometimes screeching out of place, rythm was sometimes losing its rythm, ironically). Also, I can't really hear the bass. If you have a bass player, make him stand out too, it'll make the whole song sound better as a whole.  ""Lately"" is a really groovy and happy song. Kinda reminds me of Little Joy (Fab's band).  It's good that the Strokes are your main influence! Take a look at how they harmoize their lead guitar and their vocals, and how AHJ and Nick compliment Jules' voice (especially in their more recent albums or in Reptilia). You might benefit from that imo! Definitely post your next song here again, and if you don't I'd appreciate a PM, since I dont have a SoundCloud account."

TheStrokes,38vjvc,jesuslaves,3,Sun Jun 7 06:16:14 2015 UTC,Also his performance in The Strokes seems to have taken a toll as well. What else did you notice?
TheStrokes,38vjvc,SnipingBeaver,8,Sun Jun 7 06:24:18 2015 UTC,"I personally really like the way he dresses and everything and don’t think he looks bad at all, but that’s just my opinion. What I don’t understand is how harshly his fans seem to criticize him, I mean you wouldn’t come up to him and say “hey Julian, you look really bad, are you on drugs?” Sure he looks scruffy and has multi colored but I’m also pretty sure he’s quite aware of himself, and I can only admire the fact that he’s comfortable with himself and does whatever he likes regardless what others might think of it."
TheStrokes,38vjvc,SnipingBeaver,10,Sun Jun 7 06:51:57 2015 UTC,"This isn't a fashion thing, this is us being concerned about Julian's health because the Strokes do have a drug history."
TheStrokes,38vjvc,jesuslaves,3,Sun Jun 7 07:26:35 2015 UTC,"I am concerned because lead singers tend to deal with a lot shit (personal demons, emotional, band tensions, expectations, drugs, alcohol, struggling to keep band going, etc). Because of that, there has been a trend of lead singers (notable ones) dying young (suicide, OD, health issues, etc) (maybe this is a stretch)   Example: Ian Curtis from Joy Division, Jim Morrison from The Doors, Kurt Cobain from Nirvana, Jay Reatard, Joey Ramone from The Ramones, Jim Hendrix, and i think thats all from top of my mind   Look at Albert, he looks great as ever and even better shape than he was 5 years ago. (i believe he is clean now). Also Nikolai (same age as Julian) looks fairly the same and hasnt even age that quick or horrible as Julian. Yea, Julian dress like shit sometimes but he pulls it off good regardless and that scraggy hair; but his physical appearance does not look healthy nor does it look like his typical tired, drunk/stoned-like appearance."
TheStrokes,38vjvc,Truver27,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:42:32 2015 UTC,"no dude, I'm agreeing with you. The top comment seemed to have confused your post with being about Julian's fashion choices and what-not."
TheStrokes,38vjvc,acp3q,0,Sun Jun 7 08:38:56 2015 UTC,"Oh i linked jesuslaves my response.   I am just a very concerned fan. Being a sort of avid follower of many legendary rock bands and singers, with the Strokes current situation and given Julian's poor current state, I have this small gut feeling there might be downfall for The Strokes. Although Julian might seem happy and satisfied with his Voidz project, he is harbouring a lot of stress/pressure lately (Cult Record Label, Being in two band, keeping fans happy) and an ongoing unresolved tension (maybe it is resolved - having to do with his longtime friends, members of The Strokes).  I dont know much but both Albert and Julian have been very cryptic in their words and actions (like Albert leaving Cult and his reaction to Vision of Division) regarding the state of The Strokes and the rest of the members are just silent as of now."

TheStrokes,38lilo,50_shades_of_clay,6,Fri Jun 5 05:28:04 2015 UTC,I guess he wants the album to be remembered on its own and not something under the label if his friend
TheStrokes,38lilo,Ammarzk,2,Fri Jun 5 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"From Albert himself, he had said ""it's a matter of standing on my own feet"" away from a friends record label."
TheStrokes,38lilo,dysphoricjoy,7,Fri Jun 5 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"Cult Records always seemed unprofessional and sort of unreliable in a way, so I don't mind the move at all.  Now that he's signed under another label, his booking agent, publicist and his management are all under his contact page on his newly made website.  Under Cult Records, there is only a general email address under the contact page, which nobody answers. It also seems like their social media pages are run by interns (not that I have a problem with that in general).  It's impossible to find the JC + The Voidz public relations handle without digging really deep, just to inquire about a press pass for a venue."
TheStrokes,38lilo,shy,2,Fri Jun 5 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Cult seems to be nothing but setback after setback at this point. The Tyranny vinyl taking five months to ship is beyond me, but whatever it indicates isn't good.  Vagrant is an established label with a good track record. Also, don't forget that Ryan and Wiz Kid are still managing Albert so I'm sure they had to recommend that he put the record out somewhere else."

TheStrokes,38kaf7,mocranks,14,Fri Jun 5 09:31:10 2015 UTC,Well...honestly I wouldn't worry about this too much. I think Albert is just being honest because he really doesn't know what the future plans are. There's no point in saying they're going to make new music if they haven't decided amongst themselves yet.  If they were going to call it quits you can bet they'd do some major farewell shows in New York just like LCD Soundsystem did.
TheStrokes,38kaf7,greatestape,5,Thu Jun 4 20:33:29 2015 UTC,This explains why Julian added more NA dates.
TheStrokes,38kaf7,jibelite,10,Thu Jun 4 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"I really, really wouldn't be surprised by this. I'd rather have 5 stellar records to look back on than them resent each other and crank out something tired and cliche sounding to cash in on the name (I'm looking right at you Rivers Cuomo).   Julian seems very devoted to making The Voidz and Cult Records a success and everyone in the band has another project they're working on now. If nobody's heart is in it, let it be a fond memory and we'll all go to the reunion tour in 20 years and dance in our mom/dad jeans, Chucks and leather jackets. It's entirely selfish and greedy of fans to expect a band or musician they like to never break up or quit."
TheStrokes,38kaf7,infinitydefines,6,Thu Jun 4 20:22:22 2015 UTC,"...""we'll all go to the reunion tour in 20 years""  I doubt we're going to be seeing a 56-year-old Casablancas onstage singing Someday...but that's just me."
TheStrokes,38kaf7,greatestape,4,Thu Jun 4 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. If they aren't feelin it, they should just let it go. There's probably tons of people tempting them with massive amounts of cash but I'd rather just have those 5 good albums than watch them turn into a parody of themselves like so many others have."
TheStrokes,38kaf7,GarciaLater,-2,Fri Jun 5 15:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly more interested in hearing more Voidz, Little Joy ect. The Strokes were great in the prime but their last 2 albums have just been mediocre. It's best they move on I think."
TheStrokes,38kaf7,frankenham,6,Fri Jun 5 14:22:07 2015 UTC,Did they have another falling out? Maybe that's why AHJ is on julians label anymore?

TheStrokes,37yuj1,gymnasticraptor,14,Mon Jun 1 11:56:13 2015 UTC,I didn't think it was that bad except for not being able to hear most of it due to the bass drum drowning out all the other sounds.
TheStrokes,37yuj1,kekewewe,7,Sun May 31 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"same here. I don't know why everyone is making a huge deal about this.   It is like the second time the Voidz have ever played that song (think first was the HS screening) so of course it has room for improvement.

TheStrokes,37wmwx,diminnuendo,3,Sun May 31 01:07:56 2015 UTC,I agree. I think they sounded better than when I saw them at ACL in 2010. Machu Picu and One Way Trigger were two of my favs. Julian was really nailing the notes. Nick sounded so good.
TheStrokes,37wmwx,kekewewe,8,Sun May 31 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"Great set so far. One Way Trigger was tough on the vocals, but Julian hits some new notes in the vocal fills (Voidz sounding).  I swear in Juicebox, 31:24, it's ""waiting for some cocaine waiting for some pussy""  ?"

TheStrokes,37wmwx,Nelsloth,10,Sun May 31 06:06:39 2015 UTC,They came on about fifteen minutes late and ended a few minutes early.  Performance was good but it sucks to see them not really having fun on stage.  At least it looked like they weren't having fun.  Also why is their stage always so dark?  And why does Jules always wear sunglasses? Haha

TheStrokes,37wmwx,Walksonthree,4,Mon Jun 1 00:58:36 2015 UTC,This seems upsetting. The Strokes are one of my favourite bands to ever make music but there doesn't seem to be any passion when they play anymore.

I think Albert is more of a continuation of the sound The Strokes had for the first three albums.  Current Julian is just doing his own thing.

TheStrokes,37u91m,Walksonthree,10,Sat May 30 15:02:21 2015 UTC,If you put Julian's voice over Albert's recent music it's pretty much Comedown Machine.

TheStrokes,37t8da,Cuntosaurus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:15:28 2015 UTC,I agree! I said something similar about him creating an image for the Voidz in the thread about his hair. I admire his dgaf attitude.
TheStrokes,37t8da,kekewewe,4,Mon Jun 1 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"Voidz are not THAT bad live (not that good eather, as some fangirls are presenting them to be) but certainly not even close to the one of the tightest modern bands, The Strokes (example).   I can totally understand Albert's reaction."
TheStrokes,37t8da,SkyFall96,9,Sat May 30 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just a fangirl, but I thought they were really good in person (much better than in recordings). They should stick to their own songs though because playing the Strokes doesn't really work for them."
TheStrokes,37t8da,neonoctopusarms,2,Sat May 30 14:03:36 2015 UTC,When I saw them they played Ize which sounded really good. These other songs not so much though.
TheStrokes,37t8da,bizdog,5,Sat May 30 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"When they're at their best, I genuinely believe they come close. For some reason the Voidz have never delivered greatness at a festival, but their own gigs are fantastic - they're probably more in their element. I mean just listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GjwlqSy4Jw"
TheStrokes,37t8da,greatestape,10,Sat May 30 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"He's seeing for the first time from the audience's perspective just how horrible Julian is at singing that song.   Either way, it bothers me to no end that the Voidz play Strokes songs. I don't care if Julian wrote every single note. He has two full solo albums to make a set list from. If The Strokes weren't a band anymore then fine, play all the Strokes songs you want, but they are literally playing the same festival the very next day!  And let's face it, Julian can't sing this song live. It wasn't good in 2006 and it isn't good now. Just drop it from either band's set list."
TheStrokes,37t8da,kaleidoscope_ize,14,Sat May 30 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"Julian wrote this song entirely on his own he can do fuck all with it, I listened to the voidz perform it and it was great however as usual the sound mixing for them greatly underwhelmed the vocals and lead guitar (particularly the solo)."

TheStrokes,37rxup,greatestape,7,Sat May 30 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The Strokes did too. I know we'd all like to imagine that they crawled out of the gutter looking like the coolest dudes on Earth, but bands on major labels have stylists."
TheStrokes,37rxup,greatestape,3,Sat May 30 01:31:56 2015 UTC,I wonder if Albert came up with the suit thing himself though.
TheStrokes,37rxup,kittenavalanche,4,Sat May 30 01:36:23 2015 UTC,I'm sure he did. Stylists don't necessarily tell their clients what to wear. Sometimes they just shop according to an established style or idea and let the clients choose for themselves. They'll make sure the clothes fit or have them tailored so they do fit.
TheStrokes,37rxup,greatestape,10,Sat May 30 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"Julian can do whatever he wants and he's still a god, but I do miss his signature shaggy hair from a few years ago. Before he dyed it, stuck feathers in it, and then shaved it into a half mullet."
TheStrokes,37rxup,dabadeedabadaa,19,Sat May 30 04:02:09 2015 UTC,He looks...awful. They need to either fire their stylist or actually hire one.
TheStrokes,37rxup,Apology_Panda,7,Sat May 30 00:06:40 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he did it himself haha.
TheStrokes,37rxup,kekewewe,3,Sat May 30 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"I saw someone on Instagram claim to have been the stylist, but I have no clue how true that is or how to find the comment again."

TheStrokes,37rxup,kekewewe,8,Tue Jun 2 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he's doing it on purpose to create an image for him with the Voidz. He changed the way he looked and dressed since performing with the voidz. I even wonder if he's trying to not be the ""pretty boy"" anymore and have this raw punk image. He has a good sense of style and still dresses more clean cut in different occasions. Like for governors ball his Hawaiian shirt and recently a picture of him in the studio with Rey Pila he had a button up shirt on. He still uniquely dressed but doesn't look as rugged. Then with the Voidz he wears distressed jeans and vests exhibiting a more punk/grunge look.   I think once you analyze his style, image, and overall message he is trying to convey with the Voidz, it makes more sense."

TheStrokes,37mivt,SoaringMuse,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Here's my list  ISI: Modern Age because of the apathy and rock and roll sound. Hard to Explain because of the Nostalgia  ROF: 12:51 because of the new slightly electronic sound of the Strokes. What ever happened because of the sappy lyrics.   FIOE: Yolo, new poetic lyric style. Vision of division, the strokes going hard and a showcase of more complex guitar work.  Angles: I couldn't decide so I chose both, Machu Picchu/Taken for a fool, the strokes going for a new wave sound and julian singing even higher and more pop sounding. Lisitm, the strokes being super chill and brings the whole nostalgic feel back to the strokes.   CM: I honestly haven't given this album much attention so I can't give an opinion"
TheStrokes,37kvl0,ludsp,51,Thu May 28 11:06:45 2015 UTC,I really feel in a subreddit called /r/thestrokes you won't find many people that are going to say Voidz are better.

TheStrokes,37kvl0,8494,7,Thu May 28 16:10:11 2015 UTC,I think I'd have to hear more of the Voidz than just one album to really judge who I like better

TheStrokes,37kvl0,dysphoricjoy,11,Thu May 28 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Neither. At first, The Strokes, but I compared too much. We shouldn't compare, they are two different things connected by one single person. It's unfair to both bands to compare their pros and cons.  Of course, you're going to get all the fan-girls say ""The Strokes for life!"" and all that shit but if you stop and look at them separately and give The Voidz as much attention and love it deserves, as much as you give The Strokes, you'll see they're both equally as beautiful in their own way."

TheStrokes,37kvl0,THE-1138,4,Thu May 28 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"The Strokes.   They made Is This It. It changed the musical landscape of the 00's and is regarded as one of the best debuts of all time. Did Tyranny do any of that? It's a fine record for what it is and I like parts of it, but I'm not expecting anyone outside of Strokes fans are going to be into it. Plus how long can Julian pay for the Voidz out of his own pocket? Touring is expensive and it's not like they're making a ton of cash from record sales.   Maybe the next Voidz record will be amazing and knock everyone's socks off and I'll love the Voidz more than life itself, but I doubt it."
TheStrokes,37kvl0,Walksonthree,4,Thu May 28 16:12:09 2015 UTC,I feel the Voidz are way better right now... because Julian is passionate about them and the main driving force like he was when the Strokes were great.

As one of our favorite bands ages, the drive behind Julian is still there, we're just going to see different forms of it and it's inspiring and motivating. Changing doesn't mean it's going to be better or worse, it's just a different and new you.

TheStrokes,37fh2r,greatestape,-3,Mon Jul 20 04:56:32 2015 UTC,It's definitely not. Do they always fake it like that or is it just for this video?
TheStrokes,37fh2r,disownedpear,-3,Wed May 27 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know. You can tell that the Last Nite video is live, but that doesn't mean Julian didn't redo the vocals later. The Strokes were insanely tight when they made that video. The only other video that I know was recorded live is the Arctic Monkeys' I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor. Again, that's clearly live but that doesn't mean it wasn't fixed up.  Human Sadness however? No fucking way. I guarantee Julian redid his vocals"
TheStrokes,37fh2r,greatestape,6,Wed May 27 19:01:49 2015 UTC,Doubt it he's especially sharp on several parts of the song and the quality is straight out the PA muddied in the mix. If they can play it well on tour then can play it near true to what it's supposed to be when they are on a video set.
TheStrokes,37fh2r,Ryanea,5,Wed May 27 19:38:26 2015 UTC,I agree. It sounds so raw has to be live. Also reminds me of how it sounded live.

TheStrokes,37918d,continentaloutlaw,29,Mon May 25 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'd pretty much just listen to their discography chronologically. Starting with Is This It is bound to get you hooked, and if you're still doubting after that album, Room on Fire should seal the deal. Their first 3 albums are a lot more alike than their last 2 - primarily because Julian (lead singer) wrote almost all music to the first 3, whereas on album 4 and 5 (Angles and Comedown Machine) everyone from the band started contributing.   Also, make sure you check out all the solo work too! Albert Hammond Jr. and Julian Casablancas both have really great solo albums."

TheStrokes,37918d,Flash_Dance,9,Mon May 25 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man, welcome aboard!   When i was starting out around 10-11 years ago, the songs that hooked me to them were Reptilia, Automatic stop, You Only Live Once, and Ize of the World.     I think my favorite part about the band is how the lyrics really just hit home, you know? There's a song for every situation you go through in life, and it just nails is perfectly. This band has defined many parts of my life, and i absolutely adore them. I hope you come to find similar success with them man. You're always more than welcome in this sub, and thanks for asking! :)   also, people on the sub voted for their favorite songs for a subreddit album here, this is probably a great place to start too. I would make a playlist with some of these and just knock them out! I mean, ideally if you have time, you should just listen to all of the albums in their entirety, but i know that's not always the easiest thing to do.

Opinions vary wildly for their last three albums. Some people dig them some people don't. I love certain songs on First Impression Of Earth and Angles, but there are definitely a few songs that I don't care for. I found Comedown Machine to be a really strong album."

TheStrokes,37918d,Fuser55,3,Wed May 27 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in band history, then this video has a really good explanation on their NYC origins in the early 2000's. If you're interested in more history, then their Wikipedia pages are pretty good.  As for songs? Honestly, what /u/tinewashere said is good, listen to their albums in order, you'll observe their creative evolution.   Julian's solo work is supposed to be pretty good, especially his latest album, but it's not for me, it's more electric I think? Kind of like Angles. AHJ's solo work is so good, and his new album is coming out soon! I don't know any of the solo work for Fab, Nikolai or Nick.  I also recommend just looking on YouTube for some festival performances or interviews, you'll begin to get personalities for each band member (I personally like this one)  And one more thing, their music videos are reallyyy good. Someday and Last Nite are very iconic.  Congrats on discovering one of the greatest bands ever! The Strokes have meant so much for me throughout my life, hopefully you treasure them the same! Feel free to PM me if you need any more ""guidance""."

TheStrokes,370jco,AcidOnTheBrain_,6,Sun May 24 03:13:02 2015 UTC,There was a show in LA last night?
TheStrokes,370jco,sick_transit,3,Sat May 23 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"For real, I had no idea and I live here!"
TheStrokes,370jco,gothtrot,1 point,Sun May 24 00:19:54 2015 UTC,Yeah but tickets sold out fast again.
TheStrokes,370jco,kekewewe,3,Sun May 24 05:17:07 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome! I'm hoping the Tidal sponsorship and no phones policy means the show was recorded and maybe be released. I saw the setlist and was super happy to see little girl on there. I don't know if that's ever been played live.
TheStrokes,370jco,kungfu-seahorse,2,Sun May 24 14:06:45 2015 UTC,Little girl is so good. Definitely one of Julian's best.
TheStrokes,370jco,EnriqueSyrup,2,Sun May 24 16:27:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like a dream I might have
TheStrokes,370jco,KrustyCheerio,2,Sat May 23 22:05:16 2015 UTC,I was there. It was a great show.

TheStrokes,370jco,Walksonthree,2,Sun May 24 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Nay, I do not. Phones were taken at the front. They gave mine back since I needed to meet with co-workers, but the moment I took it out to text, some big security guard told me they had strict rules to kick anyone out that had their phones."
TheStrokes,370jco,lukin5,2,Sun May 24 03:15:56 2015 UTC,So thats where cult is getting all this money! Also Alex turner??????
TheStrokes,370jco,disownedpear,2,Sun May 24 08:45:48 2015 UTC,OP was Nick there too? I read an instagram post that said that Nick and Alex turner were there.
TheStrokes,370jco,disownedpear,2,Sun May 24 12:21:51 2015 UTC,Opened with Nintendo Blood and covered Little Girl?!?! ...you mother f*cker. lol

TheStrokes,36x4qa,cheyas,15,Fri May 22 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"Just saw it in Chicago. Really amazing. Without spoiling too much, it's like five-ish music videos/ storylines in one, cutting back and forth between them until all eventually intertwine. The main theme as I interpreted it is (quite understandably) human loss/ sacrifice. How our torments (violence, racism, sex, drugs, time, materialism, consumerism) are both individual to ourselves yet also common to everyone. And how some of our problems in life are actually pretty insignificant on a universal scale, blinding us from looking out for the best interests of humanity as a whole.  They had some technical difficulties getting it started (funnily enough). Apparently Cult emailed them a 13 GB video file that was totally uncompressed. It's just under 14 Minutes total counting the end credits which play over a higher quality version of the original Human Sadness demo."
TheStrokes,36x4qa,personsanonymous,7,Sat May 23 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Just saw it at the dragonfly they actually played human sadness live while the movie played. It was definitely something else, also it was cool to see Julian with his wife.  Oh and the voidZ came out and played for about 45 mins, they played Nintendo blood, take me in your army, little girl, vision of division etc"
TheStrokes,36x4qa,kaleidoscope_ize,3,Sat May 23 06:34:17 2015 UTC,Little Girl?! From the Dark Night of the Soul album??
TheStrokes,36x4qa,thegreyicewater,4,Sat May 23 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, everyone in the crowd cheered really loud when Julian said they we're going to try out a song that's never been played love before"
TheStrokes,36x4qa,kaleidoscope_ize,2,Sat May 23 16:37:44 2015 UTC,gaaah how was little girl live and did you get any videos?
TheStrokes,36x4qa,roomonfire26,6,Sat May 23 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"It was spot on, one of the best of the set tbh.  And no no videos they had phones taken because they were doing a taping.   Oh yeah Alex turner was there and I got to talk a little bit with Rostam from Vampire Weekend as well as jake the bassist.  There was a rumor that nick was there but he must've left with Julian"
TheStrokes,36x4qa,kaleidoscope_ize,2,Sat May 23 16:39:44 2015 UTC,Holy shit. What a night!
TheStrokes,36x4qa,50_shades_of_clay,2,Mon May 25 13:39:38 2015 UTC,Here's a video someone managed to get: http://yooying.com/p/991064479609915946_225742561

TheStrokes,36x4qa,roomonfire26,8,Sun May 24 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"very amazing. really well done, in line with the aesthetic of the band and previous output, but obviously on a larger scale. interesting mix of video media as well, it really created a distinction between what kind of scene you were watching in a very subtle and subconscious way. as I said in a previous comment, Alex stole the show.  I went to the Nitehawk show in NYC, they also showed the 3 teasers, Can I VHS You?, and the video for Where No Eagles Fly leading up to the video. really cool to relive watching that first teaser again and remembering how excited I was for this band I knew almost nothing about."
TheStrokes,36x4qa,infinitydefines,10,Sat May 23 04:29:52 2015 UTC,Loved it! Saw it on Wednesday in LA and the whole band was there taking pictures and signing autographs.
TheStrokes,36x4qa,alknil,6,Fri May 22 22:07:04 2015 UTC,saw it in L.A. too! I was in the standby line since I couldn't get a ticket and I'm pretty sure they let us all in.
TheStrokes,36x4qa,theDman18,8,Sat May 23 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"saw it yesterday, it was awesome p: it was the whole 11 minutes + credits (human sadness demo)  http://imgur.com/yzUA2sN"

TheStrokes,36ur0q,kekewewe,8,Fri May 22 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"aww thanks! Really glad you liked it. That pumpkin got me a high five from Julian, a tweet from Warren Fu, and a retweet from Cult. It was awesome!   I meant to submit a Voidz drawing or computer artwork but the contest went on while I was out of town for work so I was super busy. Also, I'm a bit of a perfectionist so it wasn't ready in my eyes to submit. Grats Winners!"
TheStrokes,36ur0q,lukin5,4,Fri May 22 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"All that amazing recognition, well-deserved!"

TheStrokes,36ur0q,kekewewe,6,Fri May 22 17:04:24 2015 UTC,I was ecstatic with all the recognition. I made it the day before I saw/met them so it made those 2 days amazing. Good idea to get your CD signed. I got Tyranny CD signed by all the Voidz and Julian signed my Phrazes shirt. Was the best day ever.

TheStrokes,36ur0q,SoaringMuse,3,Sat May 23 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's actually from the I Like The Night video, although I could see the similarities with Reptilia. The lighting in the former did provide for more interesting shots though, imo."

TheStrokes,36ri8r,ps_,6,Thu May 21 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently, they had to play the song twice because Jules messed up or something.    not uncommon on late night shows. i was at a taping of the tonight show last year and spoon did probably four takes of 'do you'. great song and all but was a little much."
TheStrokes,36ri8r,Walksonthree,3,Thu May 21 22:13:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah totally.
TheStrokes,36ri8r,infinitydefines,3,Thu May 21 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I know this is The Strokes subreddit, but did you see the Future Islands' performance last year?

TheStrokes,36ri8r,LeBronIver,3,Thu May 21 20:00:06 2015 UTC,That dude danced his balls off. I'll forever be a fan of his after seeing that performance.

TheStrokes,36qinr,greatestape,3,Thu May 21 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"...did we all watch the same video? I thought the visuals were amazing and it was really well done. Alex was the star of the video though, by far.  ETA: as for the event itself being underwhelming...it was a screening. the point was to sit down and watch something. I personally didn't stick around for the after party the girl from WIISSA DJ'd because I had work the next day, was up past my bedtime, and had to get to Jersey City from Williamsburg with no L train running. but, if it were me running it, I would have tried to get Nitehawk to do an hour long drink special afterwards for people in attendance to stick around, encourage discussion, have that ""social type gathering"" or whatever they called it in the announcement."

I love both of their side projects, but Fab's has that special cozier, personal folk quality in this album. He's also worked with Devendra Banhart on this uh... gem. But Banhart is also a folk artist and has some pretty solid stuff."

TheStrokes,3678uz,SoaringMuse,2,Wed May 20 22:49:22 2015 UTC,Is it as great as I think it'll be?
TheStrokes,3678uz,disownedpear,1 point,Tue May 19 12:43:37 2015 UTC,Yeah. You can just get any epi dot and add P 94's yourself for a similar sound though.
TheStrokes,3678uz,greatestape,3,Wed May 20 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"If you mean specifically the one that Epiphone made that was modeled after his guitar, it will take some time to find. Checking eBay everyday might be you're best bet. The thing with signature guitars is that it's generally hardcore fans that buy them and won't likely ever sell them. If you have a good guitar store in your area, ask them first."
TheStrokes,3678uz,AJGibbo,3,Sun May 17 02:22:18 2015 UTC,Nearest guitar shop is unfortunately Guitar Center. I have looked at craigslist in my local area and at my school in addition to eBay. When I find anything it's usually overpriced but I'll keep my eyes open for any new opportunities.
TheStrokes,366cmm,greatestape,24,Sat May 16 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"You can't really get caught for ripping off bass lines. If I play C F and G in the same sort of way as the cure does, you can't accuse me of plagiarism. The dudes from the Strokes were just saying that to be sincere.  I remember that there's a song that people accused them of ripping off Reptilia. And also they ripped off Hawaii from some other band. They also ripped off American girl, Reelin in the years, Barry manilow, the cure (apparently), some Latin band on one way trigger (En el muelle de San Blas), daft punk on you only live once/I'll try anything once (Veridis Quo), Clarence Clemons (under cover of darkness), Peter gunn and the list goes ON AND ON AND ON AND ON.  Look, it's not that they ripped off anyone. Even Led Zeppelin didn't rip off Stairway to Heaven from Spirit - it's called a descending bassline, it's been around forever. You could even argue that all of rock & roll was ripped off from old-time black blues musicians.  Ben Gibbard recently had an interview where he spoke about the Sam Smith-Tom Petty incident ""I think a very clear cut example of, dare I say, plagiarism is the Sam Smith-Tom Petty situation where you have a song that is flagrantly… it is the hook from one song being used for another song. To me, that was a very obvious example of plagiarism.""  He goes on to say that ""And also you have to be a real fucking idiot to, ostensibly, take the vibe of something and then admit to the press that you did that. [Laughs] I mean, look, on many occasions, we have referenced previous work by other artists and said, “Isn’t this a cool drum feel? We should try to do something like this.” Or like, “Hey, you know, isn’t the feel of this song really great?” But I would never talk to you about it. I would never give you a roadmap to a song in which we had utilized previously existing ideas.""  In conclusion, the Strokes don't really rip off anyone. They may be borderline on some songs, but obviously there has been collaboration with some of the same artists.   Ben Gibbard interview  Finding songs that sound similar"
TheStrokes,366cmm,bloodslide,3,Sat May 16 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"HOLY SHIT. You Only Live Once is totally Veridis Quo. Damn, that's kinda upsetting. Julian said it was his favorite Daft punk song."

TheStrokes,366cmm,pandofernando,1 point,Thu May 28 18:51:19 2015 UTC,00:00-00:17 of Veridis Quo sounds like same chords/progression as 00:08-00:24 of YOLO.  Veridis Quo is a little bit slower paced.
TheStrokes,366cmm,thegreyicewater,3,Thu May 28 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"You can get in trouble if it's the primary way of identifying the song. I can't just use the bassline to Green Day's Longview and expect no one to care. I doubt that was the case with The Strokes and the Cure, but I just want to know what songs specifically Nick was talking about."
TheStrokes,366cmm,dabadeedabadaa,2,Sat May 16 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"Music is full of people borrowing from each other. What's the big deal? If the Strokes took a melody or a bass line or something and made it marketable and accessible to a new audience, I think that is just as credible. Are we going to start sewing everyone who uses a I-IV-V chord progression? I think it's a funny illusion to be under that every musician has to create in a vacuum to have integrity."
TheStrokes,366cmm,JUST_A_CUPPA,4,Fri May 22 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, they tend to sample a whole bunch of their songs. Like Last Nite from Tom Petty's American Girl and Razorblade from Mandy, just to name a couple. I still love them tho"

TheStrokes,366cmm,timobriggs,3,Sat May 16 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure some of the bass lines off Comedown Machine are straight off Michael Jackson. Human Sadness's progression is taken straight from a Bach piece (I believe, may have been another classical composer)."
TheStrokes,366cmm,frankenham,12,Sat May 16 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"Human Sadness is a legitimate sample of Mozart, not just a rip. Julian has mentioned it a lot specifically as a sample."

TheStrokes,366cmm,KimKarkrashian,2,Sat May 16 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"People know the sample a majority of their songs, which brings its deserved criticism, however because it just sounds so good people are willing to overlook that fact. Some argue the song are better than their sampled counterparts"
TheStrokes,366cmm,dysphoricjoy,11,Sat May 16 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"The Strokes have never sampled anything. Sampling is when you take a portion of recorded material that somebody else produced and use it to compose a new song. Last Nite might have some similarities to American Girl, but it's not sampled."
TheStrokes,366cmm,frankenham,3,Sat May 16 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"You're right. Sampling would be when M.I.A. took the music from The Clash's ""Straight to Hell"" and used it as the backing track for ""Paper Planes"".  The only way ""Last Nite"" would be considered to have sampled ""American Girl"" would be if they literally took the recording of the bassline, for example, and mixed the vox/guitar/drums over it.   Edit: added links for comparison"
TheStrokes,366cmm,dysphoricjoy,0,Sat May 16 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Sampled/taken inspiration from/heavily influenced by etc. Last nite is almost a rip off of American Girl, so whatever that's called, that's it."
TheStrokes,366cmm,dysphoricjoy,5,Sat May 16 19:14:28 2015 UTC,Honestly the only similarities I see between the two are the intro's.. and it's just a C chord being strummed which is anything but complicated or something worthy of filing over.   You might as well say every single pop song is ripped off because they all use a 1-4-5 chord progression or some variant of it.
TheStrokes,366cmm,BDubz_V2,1 point,Sat May 16 19:54:34 2015 UTC,I'm flattered.

TheStrokes,366j1b,waifsandmendicants,2,Sun May 17 01:26:06 2015 UTC,I think the Arctic Monkeys sound more like the Strokes than the Libertines.  A lot of songs from FWM and Whatever People Say I Am have that same Strokes formula(which isn't really the Strokes property but you know what I mean).  Play the verse riff/melody before coming in with the words.  Take Old Yellow Bricks and Fluorescent Adolescent as examples.
TheStrokes,366j1b,waifsandmendicants,3,Wed May 20 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"Not really a Strokes clone, but probably has a similar image, vibe and notoriety would be Eraserheads from the Philippines."

TheStrokes,35q0ac,lukin5,10,Tue May 12 15:47:47 2015 UTC,He didn't say anything bad about the producer I don't think.  He did say “this anti-radio song has the most radio ending we’ve ever done. Singing the chorus ...three times in a row... repeating the last line...repeating the last line”

TheStrokes,35q0ac,SoaringMuse,1 point,Fri May 15 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"No, they're great songs which were listened to because The Strokes released them. If some other band had released them they would've have been dismissed as being derivative of The Strokes."
TheStrokes,35q0ac,greatestape,1 point,Fri May 15 22:58:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair I think the album is only comparatively weak due to inclusion of several unnecessary songs, not because it lacked strong songs like YOLO, Razorblade, and Ize."
TheStrokes,35q0ac,greatestape,-1,Tue May 19 08:01:32 2015 UTC,David Kahne hasn't worked with The Strokes since 2005. Joe Chiccarelli only has a producing credit for one song on Angles. You are on drugs. Drink some water and calm down.
TheStrokes,35q0ac,keefed,10,Tue May 12 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said, he called out David and then said, jk Dave didn't even produce Angles....I simply looked up who did and Joe C was the only named listed. I've got it on my shite camera at home, I'd be happy to share but thought I'd ask the crew around here for some corroboration first. Me thinks you weren't there so other than your comic book guy-esque knowledge of the band you have very little to add to this thread."
TheStrokes,35q0ac,greatestape,-1,Tue May 12 16:10:03 2015 UTC,Why would Julian attack the guy who just recorded The Strokes in the last couple of weeks? Gus didn't write the song. Julian and Nick did. Me thinks you are just adding bullshit to this subreddit.

TheStrokes,35q0ac,greatestape,4,Tue May 12 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"Search youtube for it, Julian didnt attack anyone. He was just fucking around saying how it was funny that the song with lyrics ""toxic radio"" had the most ""radio sounding ending"""

TheStrokes,35o71i,pottrpupptpals,4,Tue May 12 20:07:28 2015 UTC,Cult Records it's near collapse... their financial situation is really bad.
TheStrokes,35o71i,infinitydefines,4,Tue May 12 20:23:38 2015 UTC,Julian is quite literally throwing his car commercial money into Cult. the label is (allegedly) hanging on by a thread - I saw another user on here say the Voidz tour put the label deeply in the red. AHJ probably wants more marketing and press for this than Cult has the budget for.
TheStrokes,35o71i,alex54231,2,Tue May 12 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"If the strokes were to release an album on Cult (even though they can't), will it help their financial situation? Or is it really bad?"
TheStrokes,35o71i,infinitydefines,2,Tue May 12 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on Cult's situation as I'm in no way involved in their finances or can even speak with certainty beyond what Julian has said or what's rumored. BUT, think about it. if they are truly broke, can they afford what's necessary to make a Strokes record successful? I don't think it's just a matter of releasing it on Cult and watching the money fly in because The Strokes have a built in fanbase."

TheStrokes,35q2ym,Cuntosaurus,3,Tue May 12 16:47:58 2015 UTC,My favorite song to listen to in the morning is You Only Live Once. I haven't used it as a alarm clock before but it's usually the first song I hear for the day. Something about the opening and overall groove of the song makes me think of a beautiful morning and having a good day.

TheStrokes,35odxs,theneublack,7,Tue May 12 04:48:08 2015 UTC,"Wow I was thinking about that too, I wonder whats going on especially how he released his EP on Cult. Maybe wants more out of the label, I mean AHJ did have a couple live appearances on National TV. So I don't see that as a problem.... Hmmmm intredesting"
TheStrokes,35odxs,deeeflooo,8,Tue May 12 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that had more to with the fact that he's in The Strokes. He could've released that album on Myspace and still ended up on Letterman."
TheStrokes,35odxs,greatestape,8,Tue May 12 12:07:46 2015 UTC,I cant imagine its a fight between Jules and Albert as they still play shows together and seem solid but I guess this is in reference to Cult losing money.  Jules had some interview were he said the voidz tour drained them of money.  As much as I love the label it seems Albert is more a fit for traditional marketing avenues provided by labels like Epitaph.  Cult seems to be falling apart at the seams and Albert is trying to save his solo career.  I think the dude has a good chance he could make something big with his solo stuff but he's kinda been swept under the rug by so many reviewers and publications so he rarely gets his stuff to the national stage.
TheStrokes,35odxs,Danfilmman,5,Tue May 12 06:55:07 2015 UTC,"I thought it was on Vagrant Records Source: Albert on Twitter  Besides that, I do think it's weird for him to be off Cult. I did wonder if he had some kind of obligation to release an LP on a different label like a contract."

TheStrokes,35odxs,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Tue May 12 14:38:26 2015 UTC,Epitaph is a solid label. Cult is a fucking joke at this point. Good for Albert. I wouldn't be surprised if The Strokes ended up there as well.
TheStrokes,35odxs,greatestape,7,Tue May 12 05:21:52 2015 UTC,what's going on with cult?
TheStrokes,35odxs,fagdrew4l,4,Tue May 12 05:26:58 2015 UTC,Nothing. That's the problem.

TheStrokes,35odxs,lukin5,9,Tue May 12 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Not true, a lot is happening with Cult, just a matter of time to release. Don't listen to someone just speculating and assuming."
TheStrokes,35ng7w,greatestape,6,Mon May 11 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they are finally starting to look like they're enjoying themselves, which makes us all feel much more at ease :D"

But, with Hyde Park (which I am going to and cannot WAIT for) coming up, and them seeming to be enjoying things more, hopefully we've got some really great stuff coming on the horizon!"

TheStrokes,35ng7w,Battletroll69,1 point,Tue May 12 16:57:13 2015 UTC,I'd say the Strokes were the soundtrack of my life as well. I can remember when I was when I heard each new album. Every song is like a little time machine to my early years.
TheStrokes,35ng7w,AcidOnTheBrain_,1 point,Wed May 13 09:02:54 2015 UTC,"FIOE is important though because that is the strokes becoming more mature as a band. There's some pretty hard songs on there with awesome lyrics that aren't just about girls. You may not have to like it, but you should respect it for what it is."

TheStrokes,35jief,walkbanx,2,Mon May 11 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"I was on the rail. Fucking insanely beautiful, probably the best show I'll witness for 10 years."

TheStrokes,35jief,SoaringMuse,1 point,Tue May 12 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"I was from the South originally, came up to the NE for school, missed this amazing concert. I'm simultaneously super grateful and SUPER JEALOUS of the people that got to go. This performance was better than Governor's Ball even."
TheStrokes,35iv8w,modestmau5_,12,Sun May 10 20:24:49 2015 UTC,Had a room mate like this. We went and saw Green Day. He spent the whole time filming and then spent the next month watching his shitty video of the show that sounded and looked absolutely terrible. You can't reason with some people.
TheStrokes,35iv8w,greatestape,6,Sun May 10 20:39:37 2015 UTC,You reminded me of this.
TheStrokes,35iv8w,TheWriterofRubbish,2,Sun May 10 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"I'll take a Josh Tillman comparison, haha. But in all honesty I know everyone enjoys shows in their own way, but there's hardly a point unless you have a professional camera with good audio quality. You can't imagine how many damn snapchats were being taken, only to be uploaded to someone's ""story"" which no one's gonna even watch. Just enjoy the show with your eyes."
TheStrokes,35iv8w,perfuume,3,Sun May 10 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"I wish they'd just release the footage being shown on the Jumbotrons with audio from the mixer. I guess they are worried it won't sound good and don't want a permanent record of it in existence? But instead there is a permanent record, and it sounds even worse because cell phones sound awful."

TheStrokes,35iv8w,walkbanx,1 point,Mon May 11 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"It's cool haha. Like I said to each their own, I just wish people would worry less about posting their concert vids all over snapchat and enjoy the show. I could see for most of the show, it wasn't too much of a problem for me cause I'm 6' 2"". I had some buddies with me who were shorter that we're having a real hard time with it."

Their last two albums have had some nice songs but it's so poppy and generic and would rather see something a little more serious."
TheStrokes,35hyif,Clarkey101,7,Sun May 10 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd swap Vision Of Division for Razorblade and All The Time for Tap Out.   EDIT: Oh, and Machu Picchu out for Gratisfaction."

TheStrokes,35hyif,zayetz,4,Sun May 10 16:04:23 2015 UTC,"This tickled me, too. I was in the crowd and these two bros behind me were having the most musically imbecilic conversation. They began debating which song the Strokes would open with, and, tongue in cheek, I suggested You Talk Way Too Much, knowing full well that they'd never play it.  Imagine my surprise.."
TheStrokes,35hyif,lukin5,5,Sun May 10 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"lol, this thread is funny. A few days ago I said I'd be happy hearing Julian read the local phonebook if it meant they were coming to town...grass is always greener, right? (not directed at OP, just funny how we always want more...)"
TheStrokes,35hyif,lukin5,4,Sun May 10 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah don't get me wrong - I couldn't give a fuck what they play, I just wanna see them.   But obviously everyone has their favourites and was just wondering what everyone would prefer."

Sure it was a hit, but they've said they don't like playing it on several occasions. I don't think anyone would give a shit if they dropped it."

TheStrokes,35h20v,Walksonthree,3,Sun May 10 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Dude, I'm impressed. I only have 6700 after three years! And most of that was from 2 memes I posted in the last month."
TheStrokes,35h20v,greatestape,2,Sun May 10 16:16:02 2015 UTC,Its mostly from the daft punk sub and this sub. And honestly after the first few posts the thrill of karma died out :p
TheStrokes,35h20v,Walksonthree,1 point,Sun May 10 16:17:36 2015 UTC,also did you make sure they were dank

Also like, after a concert I'd want to see videos of the shows so I guessed you guys would too. And I honestly didn't do it for the karma, I really just wanted to share the excitement."
TheStrokes,35h20v,Walksonthree,4,Sun May 10 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"i think people would rather see those posts than this one, though the all caps is probably a bit much."

TheStrokes,35h20v,Walksonthree,4,Sun May 10 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the subreddit to be earning that sweet sweet karma, but yeah I agree. He should have just compiled it all into one self-post or made a YouTube playlist with them all and linked it. Oh well."

TheStrokes,35h20v,Finial,6,Sun May 10 14:23:08 2015 UTC,This is the first big show the strokes  have done in a while and they nailed it so of course there is going to be a lot of posts about it on the sub.
TheStrokes,35h20v,iamstopandgo,3,Sun May 10 16:09:41 2015 UTC,You've answered your own question.
TheStrokes,35h20v,SkyFall96,2,Sun May 10 09:14:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, the front page is full of these. Mods should delete all of it and then contain it all in one post."
TheStrokes,35h20v,Cuntosaurus,2,Sun May 10 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see how anyone is fine with it. There's like 10 of these. He should delete them, make a playlist on YouTube, then post that. I'd upvote it."
TheStrokes,35h20v,mocranks,3,Sun May 10 16:50:18 2015 UTC,What does karma do? I dont get why people on reddit obsess over it. Is there perks to having more?
TheStrokes,35h20v,Cuntosaurus,3,Sun May 10 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not even talking about karma, man. It's just that the front page is all caps right now."

TheStrokes,358imp,greatestape,6,Fri May 8 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"I visited Chicago a few years back and had an amazing time. I'd highly recommend that everybody goes there at least once. Before I left I decided to look up record stores that I could visit while I was there. I came across Reckless Records. They had a searchable inventory on their website and just happened to have a record that I'd been after for a while.   So, the morning after I arrived, I took the Blue line up North Milwaukee and discovered that the store I was looking for was in a really cool neighborhood. The Pitchfork Media offices we're just a couple of blocks away. There were plenty of cool shops and restaurants. In fact, the movie High Fidelity used locations in the area for a few scenes.  So I get to the record store and find what I'm looking for. I make a habit of checking out The Strokes section in every record store I go to on the off chance that they have something I've never seen before. Sure enough, they have this CD single for Hard To Explain. I got really excited when I saw that it includes the live version of Last Nite that had been a b-side on the Last Nite single. I never picked up a copy of that so I was pretty stoked. The live recording comes from something they did at an LA radio station. There were also versions of Trying Your Luck and Take It Or Leave It from the same sessions on the commercial HTE single. If you've heard these sessions than you know how great they are. Wonderfully produced and recorded. Now I don't know if they did anymore than these three songs but I really hope they did and that one day they'll be released.  As far as I can this single was something that was given away for free to promote the band. It has a ""Not For Sale"" disclaimer and announces the Is This It release date as September 25. Maybe it was a radio thing? I have no idea, but I'm glad I found it! I  I love Chicago!"

TheStrokes,3577cr,bloodslide,6,Thu May 7 17:59:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Landmark is streamed!

TheStrokes,356uqm,greatestape,3,Thu May 7 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a pretty small town. We had a pretty good record store, but even so I had to resort to Amazon to get a lot of the music that I was into. In 2002, I finally got out of that town. It was incredible to finally have access to real record stores. Dozens of them! You could hangout, talk to clerks, discover stuff you might never have found if you hadn't gone in that particular day. It was nice to go to a record store without any idea about what you were going to buy and then just spend an hour browsing. I bought a lot of music that first year. I also started buying vinyl records with the complete intention to save up and buy a record player.   I only spent money on albums that I absolutely adored, so when I saw the glove cover of Is This It, it was a no-brainer. It's not a Rough Trade copy, but it was made in Europe and has New York City Cops. I don't really know what the deal is with that. Maybe RCA handled the vinyl back then? The whole vinyl craze wasn't nearly anything like it is now. I don't actually know if Rough Trade produced vinyl copies or not. I guess it doesn't matter. The packaging is very simple. There's no lyric sheet or insert of any kind. In fact, it's kind of cheap looking compared to some of the other records I bought around that time.  Now here's the funny part: I never bought a record player. I was in university and wasn't exactly flush with cash so my money went to important things like beer and pizza. Plus, I already had CD copies of all the vinyl I was buying, so despite my original intention, I couldn't really bring myself to pony up the money for a record player. I'm also a bit of a gear freak, so buying a cheap one wasn't even a consideration.  So, 13 years later I still have this perfectly fresh copy of Is This It that has never seen a needle."
TheStrokes,356uqm,ThroatySteak,1 point,Thu May 7 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I think RCA owns Rough Trade. If that's the case, RCA probably handles the distribution as they are obviously a lot wealthier"

TheStrokes,356lz6,werrt1234,1 point,Sat May 9 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"It might depend on what type of ticket you have. When you arrive to the ticket check in, just ask around. I bought a 3 day pass for the festival and you could pretty much stand or sit anywhere you want if you show up to their respective stage early enough(festivals have multiple stages so you'll have to find out which stage the Strokes will perform at).  Word of advice; you'll probably won't have time to get food, as the lines for each vendor are ridiculously long and you might miss a few min of a show. Surprisingly, the merchandise line I was in moved relatively fast."

TheStrokes,3543i5,werrt1234,7,Wed May 6 22:59:32 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be a debbie downer, but I'm going to be straight with you here werrt1234. You're going to a music festival, to get a major headliner to sign a vinyl you have, without any sort of backstage pass. Do you know how annoying it'll be to carry this thing with you to the front of the barricade? Which by the way, you'll have to get in line AS SOON AS THE FESTIVAL OPENS. You run there as fast as you can, and you'll be there getting beat by the crowd and they'll never come down to you to sign that vinyl. At the end, some jerk might try to snatch it from you while the crowd is going crazy.  Here's some advice to you: Find a way to get into backstage. If you REALLY want to do this, you'll try to find a way. Otherwise, there is almost no chance this is going to happen.   Trust me, I work for Cult Records (the bands lead vocalist indie label) and even with the backstage passes, they're hard people to follow."

TheStrokes,34hgok,bizdog,0,Sun May 3 14:37:45 2015 UTC,Pro-Tools and Logic are the standards used by pros. If you're looking to get into producing/engineering you'd better learn both.

TheStrokes,34hgok,SoaringMuse,2,Sun May 3 23:32:14 2015 UTC,They're running a Pro-Tools HD system which costs anywhere from $10 000 to $20 000. The consumer version of the program is only a fraction of what it can do.
TheStrokes,34hgok,greatestape,2,Fri May 1 14:40:53 2015 UTC,I've had a chance to use the regular consumer version and I think it's really good. I can't imagine how much more powerful this version is.
TheStrokes,34hgok,alex54231,1 point,Fri May 1 17:45:29 2015 UTC,The consumer version is very good for what it is. The pro version comes with hardware that does all the digital signal processing and has a ton of more features.
TheStrokes,34hgok,greatestape,2,Fri May 1 19:36:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured it's waaaay more expensive than my $200 version :D
TheStrokes,34hgok,SoaringMuse,6,Fri May 1 18:51:28 2015 UTC,I'm gonna see them in Tampa in about a week and if they play an early version of one of their new songs like they have in the past I'll actually lose it.
TheStrokes,34hgok,arqumfarrukh,10,Fri May 1 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"At the very least they're recording demos! There would be way more tracks if they were doing anything serious. But this, this, is a good sign!"
TheStrokes,34hgok,greatestape,14,Fri May 1 05:08:47 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, man! It's not like they layer their guitars too heavily. Also I bet this is a fairly new track"
TheStrokes,34hgok,Cuntosaurus,4,Fri May 1 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible. The reason I say that is because it's pretty standard to record guitars on two tracks with two mics- an SM-57 and a large capsule condenser mic. Plus there's just one mono track called 'drums' and a room mic track. So, it looks like they're doing rough versions of something.  Also, this is a screen shot of the Under Cover of Darkness edit window from a Sound on Sound article with Gus:  http://dt7v1i9vyp3mf.cloudfront.net/styles/news_large/s3/imagelibrary/I/IT_Jun_05-0611.jpg?_HeHufqJUKPuUAePQw_fueycmFHxM4m4=&itok=g3MV6Idb"

TheStrokes,34g6tm,TheDutchRudder41,3,Thu Apr 30 22:08:50 2015 UTC,How?
TheStrokes,34g6tm,trying_my_luck,4,Fri May 1 06:15:30 2015 UTC,From the interviews I've read Julian had a serious alcohol problem and he eventually quit around 2004 or 2005 and he said he was hungover for 2 years after it. FIOE was recorded during this time I believe and when you listen to the music there's a lot of loathing and such on the album.
TheStrokes,34g6tm,kick_dicker,9,Fri May 1 15:04:22 2015 UTC,ITT: Everyone taking out my favorite songs
TheStrokes,34g6tm,Horselain_Porcelain,7,Fri May 1 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"This is a really good album, i had a hard time trying to pick songs. I think if i had to get rid of 3 of them though it would be ""ask me anything"", ""killing lies"", and ""15 minutes"". With the exception of ""ask me anything"" it was a pretty difficult choice.  I thought it was interesting to see so many of you pick ""On The Other Side"", I think its one of the best songs on the album."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,boydivision829,2,Thu Apr 30 22:30:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that any Strokes song is all bad. I enjoy the introspective nature and sentiment of ""On The Other Side."" However I really dislike the chorus of the song, specifically Julian's uncharacteristically whiny vocal delivery, and the overly simplistic and obvious lyrics, which really just consist of the song's title phrase being repeated again and again, as in many of FIOE's worst songs in my opinion. I do still like the album overall. I feel that it's pros outweigh its cons but I do feel that it could have been tighter. Don't get me wrong when I criticize Julian's singing in that specific part of ""On The Other Side."" I'm a singer and I would say that no one has influenced my singing style as much as Julian has, especially with how passionate and emotional, yet energetic and downright bad ass his vocal delivery usually is."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,gymnasticraptor,5,Thu Apr 30 22:50:27 2015 UTC,I actually love love love this album. It was the first ever Strokes album I listened to. I don't get all the hate it gets. I love it a lot.

TheStrokes,34g6tm,fuzzymarmalade,6,Thu Apr 30 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, the lyrics are what really hold that song back for me. The number of times he says fear of sleep almost becomes comical for me. Repeating the same phrase over and over again consecutively is kind of a trend in FIOE...""Ask Me Anything"" (""I've got nothing to say"") and ""Killing Lies"" are both responsible for doing this as well."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,disownedpear,2,Thu Apr 30 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"If you think Fear of Sleep is bad, look up Sometimes in the Fall by Phoenix. Thomas (the singer) says ""Sometimes in the fall"" about nine million times."

TheStrokes,34g6tm,SoaringMuse,5,Mon May 4 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"In the defense of ""On the Other Side"", it's one of the most emotionally raw songs on the album. Julian had just given up drinking. The lyrics are very powerful, and the song itself is good.   ""Killing Lies"" grew on me after listening to it a few times, but it's definitely more of a filler song.   I'd remove ""Fear of Sleep"", ""15 Minutes"", ""Ize of the World"", Electricityscape"" and maybe ""Ask Me Anything"". None of them are particularly enjoyable to me, just overproduced and strange."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,cinderwild2323,8,Thu Apr 30 22:45:51 2015 UTC,Surprised to see Ize here. In my opinion it saves the middle portion of FIOE. Definitely one of their most unique and complex songs.

TheStrokes,34g6tm,nocode52,2,Fri May 1 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fear of Sleep, Killing Lies, On The Other Side and Electricityscape, and I put in Hawaii, how did that finished up as the Juicebox Bside instead of the album is mental."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,disownedpear,2,Sat May 2 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"Killing Lies, Fear Of Sleep and 15 Minutes. I like Ask Me Anything & On The Other Side - and honestly feel like Electricityscape is one of the best songs on the album.   Personal opinion, I guess."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,8494,2,Sun May 3 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps an unpopular opinion here but I actually think FIOE is a masterpiece. Hard to beat the likes of ITI and ROF but I think its the quintessential best work of this beautiful fucking band.  Wouldn't change a damn thing, not in a million years. That's just me though."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,thegreyicewater,2,Wed May 6 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"First Impressions is fine how it is.   It just really needed to be a double disc.  Half of it is the First Impressions of Earth,  the other is the loneliness that a new place or life brings on.    First Impressions is a huge point in the evolution of this band and is criminally underrated."

I'm quite surprised to see On the Other Side mentioned so much, I really love that song. Also it surprises me in general the way people view FIOE, I think it's an underrated masterpiece."
TheStrokes,34g6tm,EnriqueSyrup,1 point,Fri May 1 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"On the Other Side, Killing Lies, 15 Minutes for sure.  Put them on a b-side compilation album."

TheStrokes,347ohv,cmonnats,4,Wed Apr 29 11:25:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is great. The vibe is clearly good in the band if they're playing this many shows. I know they've said how touring can destroy a band so I don't think we'll see them play big world tours in the near future but if we get a good number of strokes shows every couple of summers, I'll be a happy man"
TheStrokes,347ohv,goingtoclass,3,Wed Apr 29 11:10:05 2015 UTC,GODDAMNIT. I live in DC an purchased my Shaky Knees ticket like less than a week ago.

TheStrokes,346b9f,lukin5,10,Tue Apr 28 17:23:44 2015 UTC,Fun Fact. The Strokes logo is based off the Magna cigarette logo. I'd link but I'm on mobile. I learned this because Charlie always wears a Magna shirt on It's Always Sunny and I thought the shirt was borrowing the Strokes logo but its actually the other way around!
TheStrokes,346b9f,Pqqtone,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"Funny, I thought the same. Good intel!"
TheStrokes,346b9f,greatestape,0,Wed Apr 29 14:24:09 2015 UTC,There's actually a picture of Julian wearing a Magna shirt somewhere.

TheStrokes,346b9f,SkyFall96,2,Tue Apr 28 18:51:24 2015 UTC,I can totally see Julian wearing one of those
TheStrokes,346b9f,Ammarzk,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:50:29 2015 UTC,Two of my favorite things: The Strokes and Asoiaf!
TheStrokes,346b9f,SoaringMuse,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"LOVE GoT, but my favorite house is Lannister >:)"
TheStrokes,347xnj,cmonnats,2,Wed Apr 29 00:36:34 2015 UTC,Why not both? You'll have to wait 5 months though
TheStrokes,347xnj,Walksonthree,2,Wed Apr 29 06:06:08 2015 UTC,"I could do both, but i dunno. As much as I love The Strokes, since I saw them at Gov Ball last year I'm not DYING to see them as much as I was then and have no problem waiting a little bit more to see em again. Plus, disposable funds are tight and I'd love to save the money Id be spending on the 8 hour road trip."
TheStrokes,347xnj,Walksonthree,2,Wed Apr 29 06:14:53 2015 UTC,Yeah then you should probably save up. And the money you'll get back from hopefully selling the ticket is a plus point.
TheStrokes,347xnj,Walksonthree,2,Wed Apr 29 06:20:17 2015 UTC,That money is going directly to their DC show. haha  :D
TheStrokes,347xnj,Walksonthree,2,Wed Apr 29 06:24:14 2015 UTC,Cool! Sell asap to get good tickets man
TheStrokes,347xnj,animalcrackersandtea,2,Wed Apr 29 06:26:47 2015 UTC,That's the goal. The ticket is also up on eBay but no bites so far.
TheStrokes,347xnj,animalcrackersandtea,2,Wed Apr 29 06:31:01 2015 UTC,I'd bite if I was there :((
TheStrokes,3485tj,montse246,0,Wed Apr 29 01:42:24 2015 UTC,This isn't that great. You can obviously hear the back track of the original song with the instruments having lower volume.

TheStrokes,34486k,girlfriend_pregnant,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:57:05 2015 UTC,It's a sub of barely over 4k people. Not every post on this subreddit's front page can be a winner.

TheStrokes,34486k,IDONTCARE6666666,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:24:31 2015 UTC,He was raised an only child. I am not sure if he has any half siblings that he was not raised around though.
TheStrokes,34486k,lukin5,2,Tue Apr 28 18:32:23 2015 UTC,Made an account to say I had a crush on Fang because the cover model made me imagine him as Julian. No shame is to be had.
TheStrokes,341qiy,AlexVincent13,3,Mon Apr 27 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"Gotta say man, not a big fan with what your doing with your voice. I appreciate your trying to do it your own way, but I think you went way too far and it kind of sounds like someone joke singing at karaoke. Also that style just doesn't seem to mesh well with the song, more voice acting than passion. I'm not trying to discourage you, I think your guitar playing was great, I just think you might wanna try a different angle."
TheStrokes,341qiy,he_speaks_the_truth,1 point,Fri May 1 20:53:21 2015 UTC,No offense your singin blows. You put on this voice and it sounds weird and then you'll sing a line in your normal voice. just sing it all in your normal voice. Quit making fucking faces too dipshit.

TheStrokes,341qiy,Julian_Turner,13,Mon Apr 27 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"/r/TheStrokes is a place to post The Strokes related content. If you don't want to watch people do covers all you have to do is not click on the link. The sub isn't so active that covers are pushing other content to the second page or something like that, so I really don't see the problem. I couldn't see us ever banning covers."
TheStrokes,341qiy,Hitsu123,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"This is true, however I also dislike when people link-drop. I appreciate the fact that people want to share what they've created, but self-promotion without any attempt at participation in the community looks bad."
TheStrokes,341qiy,Julian_Turner,3,Tue Apr 28 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"Ok so if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying that it looks bad when people who don't even participate on the sub just post some of their strokes related content because they know that it will get views? If so, then I see where you're coming from but in my opinion this IS participating in the community, because he's submitting content. Even if this dude posted covers to 1000 different subs and never comes here again, it's still contributing to the sub in a positive way (in my opinion)."
TheStrokes,341qiy,Hitsu123,2,Tue Apr 28 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I see it in the same vein as people posting Let's Play videos into their respective gaming subreddits for views. If I see that their reddit history is nothing but them posting their own content to countless subs, it comes off as bad. It's like they're using the community for the sake of their own channel.   I don't mind too much if people at least comment or something, but when their history is 90% self-promotion then I get irked.   I'm not saying I dislike covers or to even ban them. I listen to just about each one that gets posted (usually judging a bit too harshly). In fact I've actually posted mine on here way back when and received good responses. I'm just expressing my opinion on self-promotion."

TheStrokes,33zbko,AcidOnTheBrain_,1 point,Sat May 9 14:43:28 2015 UTC,But people probably hadn't seen that interview and if they did they probably didn't even remember the comment so he might have just come off as a nut.

TheStrokes,33ylzq,hollaing,12,Sun Apr 26 21:58:41 2015 UTC,Maybe OP is Julian Casablancas himself

TheStrokes,33y8ej,werrt1234,5,Sun Apr 26 19:52:05 2015 UTC,The only chance I think you would get is if you had a VIP backstage pass. its that or you would be lucky enough to see them walking the streets the day before. Bands usually announce if they're going to have a meet'n'greet so if they havent said anything it's not going to happen.
TheStrokes,33y8ej,Deathanarchy,2,Sun Apr 26 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Shit, oh well cuz I really want to get this for my friend they're her favorite band,"
TheStrokes,33y8ej,Deathanarchy,2,Sun Apr 26 21:13:23 2015 UTC,Its a hard thing to get it signed by the entire band since they're always multitasking now. best of luck to you if you do get to meet them
TheStrokes,33y8ej,Deathanarchy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:17:10 2015 UTC,What do you mean they are always multitasking? She likes Julian the most so that's the main guy I'll go to.
TheStrokes,33y8ej,Deathanarchy,0,Sun Apr 26 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"well you wouldnt expect them  to all hang out together before the show, they have other friends playing and they would hang out with them. basically Im saying everyone does their own thing now."
TheStrokes,33y8ej,Deathanarchy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:17:10 2015 UTC,Just Julian would be fine then.
TheStrokes,33y8ej,lukin5,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:18:23 2015 UTC,go downtown the day before and you might catch him.

TheStrokes,33hpqk,roomonfire26,4,Thu Apr 23 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"I discovered Is This It and thus The Strokes when i was 15 years old and had just moved to India. At the time the only music that was accessible to us was super mainstream stuff like Green Day and Britney. Then all of a sudden me and my only friend discovered our holy grail and it just opened our eyes to alternative music. It's so hard to describe what we felt, the sound was so fresh, visceral and most importantly different. It wasn't just about the music (which ofc is stellar) it was also about what they were saying, the apathy of a generation, the strokes' attitude, their style.   The Strokes and ITI helped me grow as a person, I moved from being a shy awkward kid to someone who realized that there are so many other styles and viewpoints out there. I had trouble making friends and relating to the other kids in my school. Me and my friend constantly felt left out and alienated but The Strokes really helped us because we knew that there are other people out there who like the same things that we do. We spent countless hours disecting the lyrics (especially alone together, that was our favourite song) and singing guitar solos, through the music our friendship grew.  So ITI is not only my favourite album but one that means so much to me. It is an essential part of my formative years and reminds me of my best friend.   Sorry for rambling."
TheStrokes,33hpqk,greatestape,6,Wed Apr 22 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from its songs' meanings and composition; look at time is was released, it was a pretty revolutionary and different kind of genre of rock. Back in the early 2000s, pop punk (Blink 182, Green Day, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Avril Lavign) and emocore was very popular and rock (including punk) was heavily commercialized and thus many believed rock n roll lost its meaning and was plastic. Even punk was no longer punk or adhered to the whole ""anti-establishment"" or DIY aesthetics.   Then came the Strokes, influenced by the past and with their debut album of Is This It, they put rock n roll back to its roots and showed many that there is hope and rock n roll is still alive; hence why the media dubbed them as Saviors of RocknRoll.  I am very fascinated by the era that Strokes released their album and how they were able to maintain originality and come out very different at a time when rock lowt its meaning and saturated by commercialized punk. Heck, even their fashion sense was different, trendy/cool, and ahead of their time; i am surprised they never let popular music and fashion (baggy cargo shorts, spiked frost tips, etc) influenced their music and stye."

TheStrokes,338kju,Cuntosaurus,4,Tue Apr 21 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"Broadcast cameras run about that much. Could be more, could be less. I'm sure it's all covered by band insurance or festival insurance or the company who owns the camera's insurance. It's not like he had to pay that himself. Still, I'm sure he got yelled at. It might look cool 'on camera' hahaha, but it's a dick move. That shit is expensive."
TheStrokes,338kju,greatestape,2,Tue Apr 21 23:57:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer! Seems obvious. Maybe it was a cheaper camera specifically to break?   *thanks not that's
TheStrokes,338kju,Cuntosaurus,2,Wed Apr 22 01:39:25 2015 UTC,Well look at his face again. There's some genuine anger.
TheStrokes,338kju,greatestape,2,Wed Apr 22 13:57:58 2015 UTC,Doesn't justify it and I'm sure he knows.
TheStrokes,338kju,greatestape,2,Wed Apr 22 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"Not trying to haha, the reality is even if he's a rockstar, that kind of equipment isn't cheap.  Of course there are a few factors here: This is a festival show and the expensive equipment was affecting his ability to perform, but it's also again, expensive equipment. That one shot was cool, but worth a couple thousand? Probably not even with the most generous of cost-benefit analysis."

TheStrokes,3336fk,Walksonthree,3,Sun Apr 19 06:16:51 2015 UTC,"honestly, (maybe I am wrong) I think it is more of a coincidence than a sample. I   kind of hope is an original song that does not use samples. That beat in 11th from 10-15 sec sound like a very typical beat you find in a lot of 80s songs."
TheStrokes,3336fk,girlfriend_pregnant,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"Oh if you mean that. For 11th dimension, i suggest Love Letters - Corners. The synth are almost similar and similar-ish drumbeat."

TheStrokes,32swip,maoore,18,Thu Apr 16 14:55:28 2015 UTC,Same tbh
TheStrokes,32swip,KimKarkrashian,38,Thu Apr 16 18:55:00 2015 UTC,NME's perpetual boner for the strokes is the most amusing thing.
TheStrokes,32swip,roomonfire26,17,Thu Apr 16 16:58:13 2015 UTC,Only rivaled by their obsession with Alex Turner.
TheStrokes,32swip,KimKarkrashian,14,Thu Apr 16 18:55:24 2015 UTC,Don't forget Oasis (really just the Gallaghers)

TheStrokes,32swip,hollaing,10,Thu Apr 16 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"You know what? Music is subjective to a large degree anyway and at least these guys are sticking to their guns. Publishers like Rolling Stones are disgusting because they just rehash the same shit 10x over.  I'm a huge Strokes fan and I do NOT think The Modern Age is the greatest EP ever, but this is better than seeing something by ""one of the classics"" top the list."
TheStrokes,32swip,SoaringMuse,5,Thu Apr 16 19:25:52 2015 UTC,These lists are always a bit ridiculous since music is extremely subjective. No surpirse that the Strokes would get this from NME though. They had a huge influence on the bands that they were writing about since 2000. They pretty much were the poster boy's for indie rock and they probably sold alot of magazines on the Strokes back. They may also be considering the buzz around the ep. There was a lot of hype for the strokes before they even released anything.

It was in some interview for Tyranny, I would link it but I'm on my phone...."
TheStrokes,32r1hn,esiotrot_soup,8,Thu Apr 16 07:13:03 2015 UTC,He was disappointed with how it was received and especially since he compromised when he didn't want to. I would feel salty if someone made me do something and it didn't even make the record better.   I wonder what it would've sounded like if he had his way with those songs.   Great album though.
TheStrokes,32r1hn,Cuntosaurus,3,Thu Apr 16 14:50:24 2015 UTC,Why couldn't he have his way? It was released on his label. I think he just felt like he didn't exactly know what he wanted

TheStrokes,32rbmu,Deathanarchy,2,Thu Apr 16 14:31:55 2015 UTC,There was one with Howard Stern but it was really awkward and Julian was pretty drunk. It was on youtube last time I checked so just search it up
TheStrokes,32rbmu,jibelite,3,Thu Apr 16 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that was hard to listen to.  If I remember correctly, they grabbed him from a bar or something, then brought him to the studio."
TheStrokes,32rbmu,Deathanarchy,3,Thu Apr 16 03:18:28 2015 UTC,yeah he was out drinking with a NY baseball player or something. It's always weird to read or listen to a julian interview hes such an introvert.

TheStrokes,32lwcq,malphasia,6,Tue Apr 14 23:49:11 2015 UTC,Yes! How would we decide on song placement? Vote on top songs then vote on order?
TheStrokes,32lwcq,hollaing,4,Tue Apr 14 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"yes, vote for 11 songs, then vote for orders. then hold contest for art and stuff, but to me the mixing sounds the coolest."
TheStrokes,32lwcq,xDuffmen,4,Tue Apr 14 23:44:07 2015 UTC,I guess the only problem with 11 songs is that there are WAY more than 11 amazing strokes songs....gonna be hard to choose!

TheStrokes,32bb8j,Cuntosaurus,2,Mon Apr 13 18:19:00 2015 UTC,I just wanna say....  thank you for posting Ride Into the Sun. I'm a pretty big VU fan and I can't believe I haven't heard that beautiful song yet. Holy shit it's so good!! I think I like the VU version even better than the Lou version.
TheStrokes,32bb8j,SoaringMuse,2,Thu Apr 16 04:56:41 2015 UTC,No problem!   I think there's a couple of versions of it. Are you talking about the instrumental or the one with a bunch of vocals?
TheStrokes,32bb8j,dreamshoes,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:24:14 2015 UTC,I love the instrumental one the most weirdly enough and that was the one I was referring to lol
TheStrokes,32bb8j,SoaringMuse,3,Thu Apr 16 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"""Rock and Roll"" is the Velvet Underground tune that I most associate with the Strokes sound. Aside from Lou Reed's vocal stylings, it's got the spiky, syncopated guitar riffs and the driving, mechanical drum beat. Also, the lesser-known track ""Coney Island Steeplechase"", featured on the rarities collection ""Another View,"" released in 1986, is eerily pre-preemptive of the Strokes sound, particularly the distorted vocals and the ultra-minimal drums.  Outside of the Velvet Underground, I don't think any discussion of the Strokes' influences is complete without Television's masterpiece Marquee Moon. The guy's vocals are very different from Jules' but the interlocking guitar riffs and streamlined rhythm section are obvious touchstones for the Strokes."
TheStrokes,32bb8j,maliamer04,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:53:41 2015 UTC,Agreed so much. If you combined Television guitar work + VU/Lou vocals you'd get a pretty close version of The Strokes.
TheStrokes,32b4g6,FIDLAAR,5,Sun Apr 12 05:47:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know I really like FIOE all the way through, the songwriting really reflects Julian's isolation from friends and his alcoholism. Every song can't be the hit :)"
TheStrokes,32b4g6,ironicjames,3,Sun Apr 12 15:19:25 2015 UTC,this is excellent
TheStrokes,32b4g6,julaincasablanco,2,Tue Apr 14 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"I usually listen to Comedown Machine like so; the ones that sound most similar in style and tone:   Tap Out Happy Ending 80s Comedown Machine Welcome to Japan Slow Animals Partners in Crime Chances One Way Trigger   The songs I've left out (50/50, Call It Karma, All the Time) just don't fit in the album for me."
TheStrokes,32b4g6,chubacca84,2,Mon Apr 13 14:55:58 2015 UTC,"Also, I sometimes think about combining Angles into Comedown Machine, but the production styles are too unique. But if I did, it might look like this:   1. Tap Out 2. Two Kinds of Happiness 3. Welcome to Japan 4. Life Is Simple in the Moonlight 5. Slow Animals 6. Games 7. Machu Picchu 8. Partners in Crime 9. One Way Trigger 10. Happy Ending"
TheStrokes,32b4g6,chubacca84,4,Mon Apr 13 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"As fun as it is to entertain ideas like this, I can't really get behind it. They put out those albums the way they wanted to. Plus, mixing songs from other albums basically just makes this a 'best of' playlist. FIOE is also my least favorite album partly due to its length. When I heard that Ryan had initially convinced Julian to cut three songs from it, I made a playlist with the three songs I thought shouldn't have been on the album. Even that felt wrong. Whether I like every song or not, it's their vision and I gotta respect that."
TheStrokes,32b4g6,greatestape,4,Sun Apr 12 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a nice list, and I can definitely see the work that /u/FIDLAAR put into it, especially with the start and buildup.  But my top two favorite songs off of First Impressions aren't even on there.  15 Minutes or Evening Sun.  Both of which could be obvious openers because of their slow paces. (Or anywhere on the 'Slow Comedown Machine' you put)  Although I'd put 15 Minutes second, since it picks up pace near the end. But I know what you mean, there are a few hits and misses off of each album, but that's what is great about The Strokes. I've been listening to them for well over two years (not as long as some people here, I know) but, I first got into hits. I never thought that I would be able to sit through Evening Sun or 15 Minutes when I started listening to them, I actually would always forget they'd exist.  But, you sit down, listen through an album and actually go ""Holy shit this is a really good and complex song""  There are some songs I still don't like (mostly comedown machine, I'm working on it).  I don't know, I've never connected and enjoyed music as much as I did from The Strokes, and anytime I get into a song that I hadn't listened to extensively before, makes it seem like I'm re-discovering them all over again."
TheStrokes,32b4g6,I_Miss_Claire,2,Sun Apr 12 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe thats why, i need to spend more time with First. Slowly few songs from the album grew on me (or caught my attention) like Red Light (when i was sleeping listening to it, sounded like a very soothing lullaby), Fear of Sleep (for when i was half of awake in my school's library), or Killing Lies (some girl just changed my opinion on it).  For Comedown, I find it easier to get into since I was already a fan of 80s music (Synth, New Wave, Post Punk, Shoegaze). I really dig the high falsetto Julian sings in various songs; its very melancholic.  Considering your opinion, I will take a second look at those songs i left out again."
TheStrokes,32b4g6,greatestape,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"What was the 3 songs?  I understand where you are coming from and I respect that and their vision for the original listing. I can see what you mean by ""feeling wrong."" For an example mixing in Julian's solo work with The Strokes work is not right; as his solo work was his way of venting creativity he was not able to use with the band's work. In a way, you can say it is offensive to Julian's vision and artistry to mix in his personal work with the band's work.   But, in no way am I criticizing their decisions for their listing. This is just merely my own subjective interpretation of each of the album's main sound. This subjective composition (and ordering) is just a way to reinforce those sounds and enhance one's hearing experience with each album.  TL;DR: In all, its just an opinion of mines that I want to share on /r/TheStrokes and contribute as a fan; not a dim view at their vision nor at First."
TheStrokes,32a6a5,FIDLAAR,9,Sat Apr 11 23:56:52 2015 UTC,"Here is  a spotify playlist i ve been working on for a while. It comprises of band i think sound like The Strokes (in terms of sound, retrogressiveness, distinct vocals, or that lofi/vintage nature of Is This It.) Havent update it in a while but it should suffice your hearing pleasures.  If you do follow the playlist, i suggest you turn off notifications for whenever i add new songs to it you will get frequent updates.  Edit: If interested, I also have a Ramones/ Pulp Fiction/ Surf Punk Influences playlist and a Joy Division/ New Order Influences Playlist for any fans of those band."
TheStrokes,32a6a5,alex54231,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:36:29 2015 UTC,I've been searching for more music similar to Joy Division and New Order. Can you post the link please?
TheStrokes,32a6a5,FIDLAAR,2,Tue Apr 14 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Here is the playlist link; it doesn't have that much variety of artists, mostly comprised of New Order/ Joy Division songs, but I am still working on it.  Here are some of my favorites of the list and the highlights worth noting.  Johnny Aries - This Grave is My Bed Tonight   Inspired by The Smiths melody & got the melancholic feel of The Cure; Video is pretty entertaining as you can see that the singer even got that Robert Smith vibe and even down to that cheesy 80s dance like Robert Smith & Morissey.   Broncho - Class Historian    Very catchy, earwormy sound with that do-do-do-do; song is about a high school reunion and hooking up with those ""single mamas"" at the reunion.   Bos Angeles - Days of Youth   Dark post-punk with a touch of Surf Punk; vocals sound similar to the deadpan, emotionless quality of Ian Curtis.   Bos Angeles - Beach Slalom   Same description as above but vocals sound less deadpan and melody is uplifting for a post-punk band.   Bos Angeles - All I Do Is Dream   Very uplifting, and whenever I listen to this, it just makes me feel happy and optimistic of the future. You can not listen to this on my Spotify link because it has not been released on it yet. Otherwise they have only one album released so far and its free.     Before I intro these songs, I want to say how much I fkn love Corners (an upcoming new post-punk act of LA with a touch of West Coast / Surf Punk influence). As a huge Joy Division/ New Order fan, it just makes me love them even more and appreciate their work. Also, each of the members of Corners are talented individually and had put out music of their own that are all unique from each other. As a band, they got a sick look (& sick hair) and very Joy Division look with the button ups tucked in and rolled up.   In terms of similarity with Joy Division/ New Order (early Movement era):    Their songs got a similar melancholic, romantic lyrics of Ian Curtis (though it is not as depressing, there are some uplifting songs). They got a similar atmospheric feel like Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and New Order's Movement (that echo Martin Hannett produce in each album). The singer's vocals is pretty dynamic (sounds different in various songs). Three of the band members can sing as well providing some variety to some songs (Buoy). Similarity-wise, in some songs, singer sound very much like Ian Curtis but with an oomf of surfiness/ West Coast vibe (Pressure) or like Movement era Bernard Sumner. That infamous Peter Hook bass that became a core New Order and Joy Division sound; well, Corners got it. In couple songs (or maybe most), the bass act as a very upbeat surf-punkish rhythm and melody. The interludes of Bernard's guitar attacking at various part of the songs; Yup, Corners got that but its different from Bernard's straightforward guitar part, Corner's guitar interlude is where you get that surf punk/ West Coast touch and unique from New Order & Joy Division and what sets them apart as being a rip-off and as Corners. Corners even got that machine like drumming of The Human Drum Machine, Stephen Morris. Corners also got synth but as oppose as relying too much on it for the sound, it acts to complement their songs.   We're Changing    The opening on their album and starts off with a killer bass riff. I really like the lyrics on this songs as it is very relatable (and repeatable); songs is about forgetting past romance.     you know that's not the man I am   you know that's not the way I am     This verse just hits, i dont know if its just me or not, but it is very relatable as many of us had made many past mistakes that does not reflect on who we actually are. Hence ""you know that's not the man I am"" or ""the way I am."" Thus the singer, Tracy Bryant, eloquently ends it eloquently in a very anthemic shout: ""We're changing!""   Love Letters    This is the song that I think will get Corners a lot of recognition (and even they admit that). Song starts of with a robotic drumming reminiscing of Stephen Morris and dat fucking synth - very reminiscing of the synth of an 80s aerobic video; heck, with a very rhythmic bass of Peter Hook, this makes a great workout song like running or some aerobic exercise. But dat synth! You also get to hear some of that West Coastness to it with the various interludes of the guitar part. It even got the most stylish, finesse music video I ever seen (with all the smokes, sick visuals, swaying, and quick flashes of each band member's profile. In all, video is very original and unique from many music video I ve seen. You probably can't tell but video is recorded at The Smell.   The Spaceship   Starts off with a killer bass (similiar to Peter Hook's) and various interlude of a very menacing guitar part followed by dat scream (Yeaaaa!!). In this song, this is where you get to hear more of the vocals from a different band member (Jeffertitti). Whenever they scream ""In the space ship"" or ""in the basement"" it reminds me of the screams of ""Confusion!"" in New Order's Confusion or even Joy Division's Walked in Line; the drumming (and maybe feel) is very much like New Order's Hurt but still retain its own identity.   Pressure   In this song, this is where you get to hear more of Corner's surf-punk/ West Coast sound. Whenever I hear this song, I get this feeling that this song can be easily included into Pulp Fiction's soundtrack. At first time hearing this, you can hear that the vocals of this song is very reminiscent of Ian Curtis (and you also get that reminscent Peter Hook bass, the attacking guitar riffs of Bernard Sumner, and maybe some of the Martin Hannet's signature atmospheric feel found in Unknown Pleasures and Movement).   Buoy   This song is probably the closest to a New Order song (that bass, the drumming,atmosphere feel, and deadpan Movement era Bernard Sumner-like - or you can say Ian Curtis-like - vocals); if I blindly heard this, I could have easily mistaken it as on of New Order's unreleased material for Movement. In this song, this is where you here the variety of vocals the band has to offer ( plus 3 of them are vocalists in their respective solo work). Buoy sounds kind of similar to New Order's Hurt (most similar in terms of rhythm), Senses, Chosen Time, Denial, Everything Gone's Green (w/ the yelling), and maybe Mesh.   In all, I have a feeling they will be big soon. Last but not least but they will be having a homecoming show on May 14 at The Echoplex (I will be going for sure); to add to that, they are pretty good live as well (unlike New Order which I have heard is not that great live)."

TheStrokes,31t91e,Mooreplease,18,Wed Apr 8 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"The clean production, the technicality of Nick's guitar, the driving urgency of Albert's guitar, Julian's slightly strung out vocals, Nikolai's always in the pocket basslines all set to Fabrizio's Swiss watch like timing.  All of them together just works."
TheStrokes,31t91e,technosoul,2,Wed Apr 8 02:12:23 2015 UTC,Vision of Division best showcases what you said about Nick and Albert
TheStrokes,31t91e,Bradfordian_Scouse,15,Tue Apr 14 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"The creativity drive behind them, especially Julians. Also, the friendship and love they hold for each other. It's subtle, yet loud. If you look at videos of them just interacting with each other, you can tell they'd have no regrets dying for one another. They never say anything loving but you can see it. I have the same relationship with my friends and I'm trying so hard to start some sort of creative drive with them so we could have the same thing."
TheStrokes,31t91e,MasterBoti,13,Wed Apr 8 00:35:56 2015 UTC,Julian's voice. I like bands where the vocalist has a rasped voice.

Also: Interpol, The Sleeping, Dead Kennedys, Living Colour, Nico Vega, Rage Againts The Machine, Queens of the Stone Age and even Nikolai from The Strokes is the kind of musica I hear and like."
TheStrokes,31t91e,callmeharris,12,Sat Apr 11 00:22:51 2015 UTC,"They satisfy every itch, the groovy drums and bass, the pretty yet scratchy guitar riffs, the satisfying pull from one chord to another and of course the perfect balance of power and uncertainty in Julian's vocals. I can't listen to any other band that anyone says are similar to the strokes because they sound as far off from the strokes as possible, they sound pretentious and that's why I love the strokes, because they are Authentic in their being and their music."
TheStrokes,31t91e,KeegoTheWise,11,Wed Apr 8 01:47:49 2015 UTC,"So, my first strokes album I remember hearing was FIOE, specifically Heart in a Cage.  The vocals were really what drew me in initially.  It sounded like Julian just didn't give a fuck about how good his singing was.  This was the first time that I really found a singer that I liked whose level of skill (for lack of a better term) didn't seem so unattainable (his vocal range is also pretty close to mine, though I struggle a bit more with the high notes).  So that was nice.  For all the hate the song gets, the second chorus of 15 minutes (""everybody at the party shouldn't worry if I'm there"") is seriously what made me want to be a singer.  It was just so raw.  Really not much vocal technique like you see in some heavier band, just straight up yelling in pitch.  So, yeah, FIOE is really what sparked my interest in the strokes and my desire to make music.  Additionally, ITI/ROF are what solidified my desire to make the shitty 5 track garage rock that I do now.  I think I really borrowed from early Julian's style of singing, the whole ""don't give a fuck if I sound great or not"" deal (although, arguably I did that more because I'm not really the best singer ever).  Previously, I listened to a lot of metal (middle school, man.  I don't know).  So it made me realize that, not only do I not have to be a guitar god or have an extensive knowledge of chords, but that you can make something really catchy that is technically rather simple.  The same can also be said for drums.  Conversely, they made me realize how important a bass is (again, listened to metal where the bass is bassically mixed out).  To this day, the bass line from Is This It is still my favorite thing to play on bass.  Although, on top of all the artistic inspiration, the songs were just catchy and awesome.  So, there's also that."
TheStrokes,31t91e,fagdrew4l,10,Wed Apr 8 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"well the sound of every member of course, and i can really relate to most lyrics"
TheStrokes,31t91e,lilmissknockout,8,Wed Apr 8 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"I love AHJ's happy magic guitar sprinkles. Love Julian's voice. But really, I just love the whole aesthetic.  Such a throwback to simple 50s rock n' roll and chords and arpeggios, but with a sexy dirty modern punk vibe.  It's just fucking awesome."
TheStrokes,31t91e,Carcaju,7,Wed Apr 8 06:04:38 2015 UTC,It's just perfect rock n' roll.  Like the Rolling Stones : Sexy enough for girls and hard enough for boys. Perfect balance.
TheStrokes,31t91e,ritz1002,6,Wed Apr 8 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Ive talked about this elsewhere, but there really isnt a specific property of their songs that make me love them, its just this feeling that I get when listening. It makes me feel surrounded by the past, and not necessarily in a nostalgic manner, although it does that too, I mean its an experience that makes me feel as if the world moving at the right pace. Its an experience every time the music gets played, and I dont know how else I can describe it, even as Im writing this I have some unexplained entity rising in my core. I love the slow and methodic pacing of Under Control though, its a structured chaos of drums, guitar, and a voice that expresses itself through more than just the words. Im being vague I know, but the truth of the matter is that I cant properly describe it."
TheStrokes,31t91e,FIDLAAR,7,Wed Apr 8 06:09:18 2015 UTC,"Their retrogressive aesthetics and style in terms of their look, art (logo and album art), and music. I like how they exert a very vintage vibe - even their music videos reeks of nostalgia and exerts a vintage feel - as if they are a garage rock band from the 70s (Is This It & Room on Fire) and towards Angles & Comedown Machine they come off with a post punk/new wave (80s) vibe."
TheStrokes,31t91e,SoaringMuse,3,Thu Apr 9 00:49:12 2015 UTC,Dang man well said
TheStrokes,31t91e,alternativelyrocked,6,Thu Apr 9 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"I think Julian's passion in music showed me a world of music that I didnt know. Hell, I didn't listen to music BEFORE The Strokes. I heard Someday when i was 12 and followed them through every release since then.   I got to meet Julian and tell him that. He gave me a huge hug and told me that 'i'm no one to look up to'. His tone was humble. I'll never forget his kindness that night.   I love the band as a whole and julian as a songwriter."

TheStrokes,31t91e,ellalautier,4,Wed Apr 8 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna bring in something a little bit different. I think they are my favorite band and I love their music, but there's definitely a little bit of me that likes them (and their style of music) simply for their appearance. If they looked like hillbillies, 2010 hipsters, 90s grunge people dressed in crappy clothing I probably wouldn't like them just as much as I do now (though I probably still would rank them top 3 for mysefl)"
TheStrokes,31t91e,greatestape,6,Wed Apr 8 16:13:08 2015 UTC,The bass lines and Julian's voice really compliment each other. They also contrast a lot with the lead guitar (since its typically really high)
TheStrokes,31t91e,SoaringMuse,5,Wed Apr 8 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"Let's see. I was 19 when Is This It was released. I'd grown up listening to Nirvana, Green Day, Weezer, Radiohead...that kind of stuff. By the year 2000, Nirvana was gone. Green Day's popularity had decreased immensely. Weezer had come back a shell of what they had been. Radiohead was doing the Kid A/Amnesiac thing. Kid Rock, Creed, Nickelback and Limp Bizkit dominated the landscape. I hated that shit soooo fucking much and it was impossible to avoid. My friends listened to this shit and they LIKED it!   I'd read things here or there about The Strokes but I hadn't actually heard them. Then one chilly night in November, I was on the computer and had Conan on in the background. He introduced The Strokes. They started playing The Modern Age. I was baffled. They didn't look or sound like anything that was happening at the time. They actually looked...COOL! The sound was so stripped down but it sounded amazing to me. Most bands had huge processed guitar sounds, but Nick and Albert were just letting their guitars SOUND like guitars. By the time the guitar solo kicked in I knew I had discovered something. I bought their CD a couple of days later and that sealed the deal.   I can't believe it's been 14 years..."

When I first came across the Strokes the guitar was what got me, but then I really started to pay attention to the lyrics and realized that Julian gets it. I don't really know if I could tell you what ""it"" is, but lines like ""living in an empty world"" and ""I'm not your friend, I never was,"" and ""can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it"" really made me feel a connection. I think they have the ability to write really catchy songs that everyone can vibe with but also deeper, more introspective songs that are thought-provoking, like Ize of the World or Automatic Stop."

TheStrokes,31l6jv,thegreyicewater,3,Mon Apr 6 03:13:38 2015 UTC,"Is this the London philharmonic version? Cause form my ears it's between that and the Dunedin Consort; but both interpretations depend on the fact that the voidz sped it up on ""human sadness"" hence the confusion."
TheStrokes,31l6jv,boompleetz,7,Mon Apr 6 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"The Requiem is one of the most popular classical pieces to record, so it would be like finding a needle in a haystack. Of the ones that are of this exact tempo, there are probably dozens. On top of that, the sample was heavily modified. The link from Zombton is to a recording by Neville Mariner, one of the most popular conductors. It's reasonable to assume its from one of the more popular recordings, just as a matter of odds. But the youtube video is not actually the full movement, it cuts off before the choir enters and jumps to the Dies Irae, something like a sampler I guess. Here is the full Requiem by another popular conductor, Gardiner. Its most definitely not this one though, since he uses historically informed research that typically has faster tempos, faster than Mariner and the one in human sadness.   It's from the 1st movement of the Requiem, Introitus. It plays the 4th measure one time before going to the 5th measure which gets looped for the rest of the song and the two basslines are added in. There are 4 chords in the measure, so when you listen to the actual Requiem, it flies by in the blink of an eye.   The mix of the sample was modified to add their own layers to it, to the point where I'm not sure how you would be able to compare with orchestral performances beyond tempo. The doublebass is mixed out, the oboes and 2nd basset horn are barely audible, and I think there is a keyboard added that plays chords left out by the missing instruments.   The first basset horn is interesting, since they altered it. You can hear it by listening to the highest pitched instrument. It's only two notes, a high C descending to a B flat. In the requiem, it plays the C for 2 beats, then a B flat for 1, then a G. In human sadness, they leave out the G on the 4th beat, which makes sense because in the requiem, its tied to the first beat of the next measure. If they left it in, it would have screwed up the chord progression looping back on itself. I think the 2nd basset horn is entirely mixed out on the last beat."
TheStrokes,31l6jv,Zombotron_,3,Mon Apr 6 09:34:21 2015 UTC,I think he used the sample from this version @ 0:33 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi8vJ_lMxQI
TheStrokes,31kqfz,thegreyicewater,30,Mon Apr 6 00:42:23 2015 UTC,Julian as creative director. The proof is in the pudding. Maybe another first impressions approach could be cool. Julians solo stuff is mind blowing.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,paintblob,14,Mon Apr 6 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"Democratic Strokes hands down. To my ear, there's a lot about the first 3 albums that feel strained, like they're not as creative as they could be. The latest two albums have little twists at every corner of the music that keep it engaging and fun. I also feel that the latest albums, while not all of the songs could have passed as 'hits' or whatever you want to call it, there is a lot more coherency to them."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Trololrus,12,Mon Apr 6 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to give a categorical answer, I think the dynamic Julian has with the Voidz is probably the ideal scenario. It's his vision, he is the main song-writer, but it's still very much a collaborative effort where the other guys have important roles, everyone's on the same page and they influence the music positively. The way I see it with the Strokes is they started off as a vision of Julian's, but after the first two records I think people's expectations and other members wanting creative input dabbled with it and it became something else. The records that came after are still all solid records but the truth is in a perfect world, Tyranny would've been the logical step after Room on Fire. Anyway Julian is with the Voidz now, he’s doing exactly what he wants to do and the result is mind blowing. This doesn't mean he can't enjoy playing and/or writing with the Strokes, it’s just that I feel if he already has that creative outlet void of any expectations which produces culturally relevant music that he's genuinely happy with, I don't see why or how he'd try to emulate the same with the Strokes. So I’ll have to settle with democratic Strokes."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,jesuslaves,4,Mon Apr 6 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"Well put. I have to go with this one, too. Coincidentally, Julian himself said that his mindset/vision has never been this clear since Is This It and Room On Fire. This was from an interview concerning Tyranny, primarily."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,waifsandmendicants,17,Mon Apr 6 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"Democratic might be better for the band as a whole, but you can't deny the quality of music that comes from Julian as creative director."

TheStrokes,31kqfz,neonoctopusarms,7,Mon Apr 6 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"oh, creative director for sure"
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Julian_Turner,7,Mon Apr 6 04:01:58 2015 UTC,"I want to say Julian as director but I can't deny that some of my favorite songs especially from Angles were written by more than just Julian. Songs like Machu Picchu, Under The Cover of Darkness, and Gratisfaction. I THOROUGHLY enjoy these songs and if Julian being in complete control for that album would mean these songs wouldn't exist, then I would rather have the democratic Strokes. I feel like what ever they decide to do is the right decision because they know The Strokes better than anybody (even though I know this is just a hypothetical question)   So my vote is democratic."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Anoblylegend,13,Mon Apr 6 03:50:13 2015 UTC,Julian as Creative Director.  The first two albums are the best simply put.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Walksonthree,12,Mon Apr 6 02:22:22 2015 UTC,I want to say Julian as a creative director but he has a platform where he can be that (the voidz). I want the strokes to be a band where everyone participates and is happy together.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,KimKarkrashian,3,Mon Apr 6 07:31:44 2015 UTC,I think this is the best answer.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,SoaringMuse,2,Mon Apr 6 14:14:06 2015 UTC,That is my reasoning as well.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,ps_,5,Mon Apr 6 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"i can't imagine how it would've been to be one of the other guys in the beginning. sure you're crazy popular, but you're not exactly contributing anything....or maybe i just don't understand band dynamic in general.  anyway, like others have said, the first two can't be beat. though UCOD was a super group effort."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Julian_Turner,8,Mon Apr 6 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"Well first off they need to be able to play their instruments really well. Even though some of the stuff may seem simple, to be able to play and stay on time really well in a live setting is really difficult. They also contribute (in my opinion) just by being super cool dudes. I couldn't see the band being made of anybody else other than the guys, whether they are writing or not."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,Fuser55,6,Mon Apr 6 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"Julian as Creative Director.   I think it is generally known that although Angles and Comedown Machine are great albums, they didn't have the impact that Is This It or Room On Fire had.   That doesn't detract from their quality, they're great, but if I had to introduce someone to the Strokes, I'd first pick songs from the first three albums rather than the last two."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,GarciaLater,3,Mon Apr 6 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"In a present sense, it could also boil down to a vote between Comedown Machine v.s. Tyranny. If you could only listen to one, which would it be?  Edit: To answer OP's question. I feel like their ability to evolve and take both of these approaches is what makes the band so unique. I would vote for Julian as Creative Director, but since he also has his solo career established now, we kind of get the best of both worlds."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,ThroatySteak,2,Mon Apr 6 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"I have loved everything from The Strokes, including solo and side projects. So, yeah, I don't really care. I really hope to see another Voidz or Julian solo album though."
TheStrokes,31kqfz,SoaringMuse,2,Mon Apr 6 12:23:42 2015 UTC,A few years back I would have 100% voted for Jules tyranny. Now I'd like to see a democratic approach a little more.
TheStrokes,31kqfz,bryu_1337,2,Mon Apr 6 18:51:01 2015 UTC,I was to see julian as creative director but with the band still giving a lot of input. I think first impressions might be their best work overall

TheStrokes,31kqfz,aleksolberg,2,Mon Apr 6 18:53:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion their music has gotten a lot more interesting with the democratic thing, so thats what I'm voting"
TheStrokes,31kqfz,AcidOnTheBrain_,2,Mon Apr 6 09:38:23 2015 UTC,Julian as creative director. He's crazy talented. Although I think it's better for him to pursue his solo career and be happy making the type of music he wants to make instead of making strokes songs which don't make him happy.

I don't think that's gonna happen. Honestly, I think Julian and Albert need to collaborate more. It's no big secret that Albert is a good songwriter and a lot of the material on his albums doesn't stray too far from what most people loved about the first two Strokes albums. No offense to the other guys, but my least favorite Strokes songs are the ones that are co-written by Fraiture/Moretti/Valensi."

Albert's rhythm complements Nick's lead very nicely. I love this lyric Julian is singing: ""he would never talk but he was not shy, she was a street smart girl but she could not lie, they were perfect for each other"". Definitely completes the story he is telling the story. I wonder how long it took Julian to write this song. I wouldn't mind listening to an early version of it to see it how evolved up until its final draft. It's a shame this song doesn't get too much recognition. I saw them at FYF and was surprised they played this song. They were on fucking point that night."

TheStrokes,31dlg1,Gurchimo,5,Mon Apr 6 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"His smash attacks would most definitely be swinging a microphone, almost like the sword characters in Smash. His tilts would be standard dance moves, a la YOLO music video. neutral special: hold down B to charge his boombox. Once it's fully charged press B again to release a large sonic wave that hurts enemies within a certain radius of Jules. The longer you charge it the larger the radius side special: throws the mic stand as a projectile down special: sing, just like Jigglypuff's, except it doesn't suck. up special: he twirls the mic stand and flies upward like a helicopter. taunts could be him singing various lyrics (like ""I'm gonna fuck your face for breakfast"", for example) FINAL SMASH: The rest of The Strokes join Jules to kick ass, of course! Similar to Megaman's final smash in smash 4. Obliterates everyone in front of him.   And don't even get me started on his aerials..."
TheStrokes,31dtym,kick_dicker,7,Sat Apr 4 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, reminds me of Under Cover Of Darkness a bit."
TheStrokes,31dtym,jpofoco,9,Sat Apr 4 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't remind me of them at all, don't get me wrong I can see why though. They have those Chika Chika chords but the chorus isn't anything like the strokes.  The thing is there are a lot of bands like this that have a stroke progression style but not the same tone. Were it  the strokes it would be more lo-fi and the chorus wouldn't be so poppy. To me they sound more like the vaccines, royal concept, the 1975.   they are fun to listen to though"
TheStrokes,31dtym,kaleidoscope_ize,2,Sat Apr 4 17:55:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like an Arctic Monkeys/Strokes hybrid
TheStrokes,31dtym,lusty-argonian,2,Sat Apr 4 10:30:10 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling this would be Circa Waves just by the title, their music reminds me a lot of The Strokes (in a good way)! They're definitely worth checking out, because although they do have a strokes-y feel to their music, it's different enough to the point where it doesn't feel like a knock-off.  My personal favorite song by them is Young Chasers, so start with that one!"
TheStrokes,31dtym,GogurtIsJustYogurt,2,Sun Apr 5 03:05:16 2015 UTC,Listen to their debut album.
TheStrokes,31dtym,RichardMagpies,2,Sun Apr 5 00:31:45 2015 UTC,IMO just another knock off of their sound. I'm sorry but I'm tired of hearing this sound being replicated over and over again.
TheStrokes,31dtym,supernova_1221,9,Sat Apr 4 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"How are they a knockoff of their sound? Have you even heard Circa Waves's actual stuff? They have a much more light, up tempo style than The Strokes. Get off your high horse."

TheStrokes,31dtym,Fuser55,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:38:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the same chords and guitar tone... I guess the main thing that distinguishes the Strokes is the guitars are more rhythmically independent of each other, break out little riffs in a subtle way that most bands don't do and Julian is more unpredictable in combining verse and chorus parts."

TheStrokes,3169tf,Walksonthree,4,Thu Apr 2 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"That performance was off the heezy. Someone focused on fab, for the first time. Ytwtm is such a room on fire song, the build up to the chorus and the way Julian sings, like he's in pain, is so satisfying? Also, what do you think this song means? Like a break up?"
TheStrokes,3169tf,gymnasticraptor,3,Thu Apr 2 12:27:17 2015 UTC,I think it's for sure a break up. But the person getting broken up with is probably dependent on the first or something because they REALLY don't want it to be over.

TheStrokes,3169tf,AcidicDubz,2,Fri Apr 3 00:24:54 2015 UTC,Yes! No doubt among my favorites of them. Sometimes this is the first Strokes song I play for the day.

TheStrokes,310gq3,waifsandmendicants,11,Wed Apr 1 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"You've got that backwards. FIOE is the most compressed album and it sounds horrible. It is one of the worst offenders of the loudness war: http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=strokes&album=    From a technical standpoint, I think Comedown Machine has the best production and it's the most pleasing to the ear. That probably has to do with the fact that it was recorded at Electric Lady Studios with an old Neve console.  However when I think of The Strokes I think of Is This It and Room On Fire's bare bones production. The guitars sound like guitars. The drums sound like drums (for the most part). The most noticeable effect is the distortion on Julian's voice. I don't even think there's reverb anywhere on those first two albums.   A lot of late 90's early 00's records had these incredible huge guitar and drum sounds that I could never get playing with my friends. But when I heard Is This It, I thought ""Hey, I can actually make my guitar sound like that!""."

Also:   Find a job, find a friend, find a home, find a dog.  Settle down, out of town, find a dream, shut it down.    I interpret as the monotony of life. We're supposed do these things, but I just don't know how, and thinking about it begins to drag me down into a suffocating despair.

Towards 8/9pm The Strokes will play on the main stage. You can probably get there at any time before 6pm and still get a good spot for The Strokes as it is a festival so the general area in which you can get a good view of the stage is absolutely huge.

I got into Hyde Park for about 1 o'clock ish, as it is still considered a festival (a one day festival) there are several stages around playing different bands, there are A LOT of different stalls selling some really good food (or at least there was last year). The area infront of the Great Oak Stage (the main stage) didn't start to fill up before at least 6 ish, so you'll have plenty of time to experience the whole festival instead of standing in the same spot for 8 hours to get a good spot (i've done this before at a rhcp concert and it completely ruined the show). I would aim to find a good spot just before the act playing before The Strokes take the stage, and stay there until The Strokes come on, that way you can enjoy the festival and still enjoy The Strokes from a good view :)"

Give it a chance as some bands that are billed will appear on the other stages. Not to mention there will still be some that have not yet been announced. :)

TheStrokes,30nsjt,255255255noise,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:10:10 2015 UTC,The main support acts should all be on the main stage! You'll be able to find out who's playing and when later on towards the date.

The second chord is a Bm on the 7th fret with root on the G-string, and play with your pinky. The third chord is an E on the 12fret with root on the 13th fret of the G-string and play with your pinkey. And the Chorus is A with root on the 7th fret of the D-String, Bm with root on the 9th fret of the D-string and C#m with the root on the 11th fret of the D-string."

People get this idea that because it has a different sound that isn't garage rock, it sucks. None of their albums were written as well as FIOE, lyrically or musically. There were a couple goofy songs, but that doesn't justify throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Also, I'd describe it as Apocalyptic, as far as the sound goes"

Trying to work with two producers was a mistake and contributed to its inconsistency. It's one of the worst offenders regarding the ""loudness war"". I seriously hope it gets remixed and remastered one day. The artwork is forgettable. The title is clumsy. Plus, they released it the first week of the New Year, which is generally regarded as an attempt to bury sub-par records. Even the band knew it wasn't that good and have said as much in interviews."

I don't know too much about it, but I do know that it is an early version of Trying Your Luck.   So I haven't participated too much in these song of the week posts because I'm always late, but I'm going to try to say something about each song if I can.   Trying Your Luck  It's always felt like a really jazzy track because of how Nick's guitar part is. When I hear it, I imagine being in a restaurant at night, with big windows where I can see the outside with small sparkly street lights. It's a modern restaurant but there's a small venue for bands and singers and such. Basically a quiet little jazzy-feeling restaurant is where I imagine myself at when I hear this song.   I love hearing Albert move his hands across the strings on his guitar track.   The solo is such a sad and wonderful solo. I guess I could say that about the entire song. A somber tone that I very much enjoy. You can hear the anguish in Julian's voice and it just speaks to me. I often find myself saying (in my head) that I'll ""try my luck"" with things.   I enjoy this track and is good to listen to when I'm kinda in the dumps. I end my comment here."

TheStrokes,301k21,Deathanarchy,4,Mon Mar 30 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"They haven't had a legitimate hit since Juicebox- their first and only song to crack the Billboard Hot 100, a chart which is based on sales. That was 10 years ago. Each consecutive album has sold less and less. They haven't done a real tour since 2006. And look at those festival dates again. They didn't headline a lot of those shows. How you figure Room on Fire and FIOE caught on later is beyond me."
TheStrokes,301k21,greatestape,2,Mon Mar 30 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"UCOD was a huge hit. and yes although comedown machine has not sold as much mainly due to them not wanting to advertise the album (a whole other situation) they have sold more albums from their entire discography since 2010. you can either base that one 5>3 or that over time more people heard of them but if an old record sells later on its from someone who learned about them now. and last year they headlined each show, and this year they are headlining each show as well. I also read a post 3 months ago from a big fan who started listening to them early and like followed them and he also said there are more fans now of the strokes. the whole indie really blew up 3 years ago and the strokes just happen to fit in that genre."

TheStrokes,301k21,greatestape,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:53:57 2015 UTC,it was shown on the website of their new record label after they left RCA because people thought the strokes had quit after making the album but it wasnt the case. I dont remember the website cause I saw it a while back. sorry I dont have the link but as dumb as this sounds you're gonna have to trust me and if you dont thats fine too.
TheStrokes,301k21,Deathanarchy,6,Mon Mar 30 18:56:31 2015 UTC,At least Strokes have one of the strongest fanbase among them all and have more lasting power than them all.

TheStrokes,2zwjia,bloodslide,8,Sun Mar 22 17:55:19 2015 UTC,"If I were to imply what Albert was saying ...  In early 2000s the Strokes were pioneering retro culture along with the White Stripes. For a band like Jet to come out and smear their vision was really bad for the genre.   For instance, The Strokes have never been anything but a derivative rock band. Their first album sounds like every best rock song of the past 40 years compressed into 11 tracks. Jules tried very hard to make everything seem spontaneous, but was very clearly being influenced a little by Tom Petty, the Stooges, Guided by voices, etc ... But he never hid that fact, he even admitted that they copied Tom Petty. This is because he wanted to make the coolest aspects of rock music be visible and popular. The music ended up being original in its own right because the influences were diverse enough. A shmuck couldn't have written these sons, it required more a lot of musical geekiness and grit and understanding.  Then Jet comes along and Are You Gonna Be My Girl is a major hit. No tasteful embellishments or anything, the whole song was simply lifted.  As songwriters, the Strokes should be respected enough, and Jet should be disrespected. This is due to the tactics these bands used to rise into fame."

Everybody wants to be somebody.  I like the song, but I still prefer ITI and ROF styled songs."
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,kittenavalanche,3,Mon Mar 23 06:26:46 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I love those opening lyrics!
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,kittenavalanche,3,Mon Mar 23 18:52:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why this song usually gets so much hate... I love it.
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,TheEricBana,2,Mon Mar 23 18:52:26 2015 UTC,Same! Metabolism is amazing.
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,Walksonthree,3,Tue Mar 24 13:50:40 2015 UTC,Sounds like it belonged in FIOE
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,GarciaLater,3,Fri Mar 20 07:54:16 2015 UTC,The vocal performance is amazing. I also love the mini guitar solo. Sounds like Nick's guitar is searing. Overall I think it compliments the rest of the album really well.
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,chriskeithley,3,Mon Mar 23 20:29:09 2015 UTC,Does this song remind anyone else of Halloween???
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,TheTurnUpKindaGuy,2,Tue Mar 24 14:25:55 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, wouldn't skip the song if it was on shuffle, but wouldn't choose it."
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,TheTurnUpKindaGuy,2,Fri Mar 20 00:46:13 2015 UTC,I'm neutral about this song is what I'm saying haha

TheStrokes,2zkbyn,Gurchimo,2,Fri Mar 20 00:48:28 2015 UTC,This song is just so... climactic. It's hard to explain. It's not just a catchy single like 12:51 (not that I dislike 12:51 at all). This song has meat and bones to it. Metabolism is just so... powerful.
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,KarsanMan,2,Tue Mar 24 01:19:10 2015 UTC,"I used to always skip this song, but when I have it a chance, it was great. It felt like I was ascending to the final boss in a video game and set this high loud tone for the mellow mood of ""Life is Simple in the Moonlight""."
TheStrokes,2zkbyn,thedeltachelsea,2,Tue Mar 24 05:06:10 2015 UTC,i'm sorry but this is probably the song in their catalog that i have listened to the least number of times. it sounds like the strokes doing a muse song and i am not a muse fan.

Fucks sake Im gonna be mad if this isnt the case.
TheStrokes,2zc9ho,IronShaikh,2,Tue Mar 17 17:45:50 2015 UTC,Don't worry I think you can mix with GA. Which is probably enough reason why it should be safe just to go with the premium tickets even if its a bit more expensive.

TheStrokes,2yuxil,GameGear360,25,Fri Mar 13 00:42:45 2015 UTC,This is my favorite Strokes song.  It has such an expansive and explosive chorus and an almost whimsically sad verse.  It's glorious.
TheStrokes,2yuxil,DosZaquis,16,Fri Mar 13 00:51:26 2015 UTC,I've been saying for years that it's their best song. It's just so human. It really forces you to look at life and consider the implications of the world we live in. I also think it might be julian's best song

TheStrokes,2yuxil,gotmefeelinglikejoby,2,Fri Mar 13 04:32:00 2015 UTC,What I love about the solo is how loud and echoy (only word I could use to explain it). Its well thought out and it's funny because he's following your basic major scale; with the occasional accidental.
TheStrokes,2yuxil,TheTurnUpKindaGuy,11,Fri Mar 20 01:04:54 2015 UTC,This song and and electricityscape really stand out to me. By far my 2 favorite songs.
TheStrokes,2yuxil,stranger566,11,Fri Mar 13 07:17:29 2015 UTC,This is such a good song. I feel like the whole album itself really stands out in this way. First Impressions of Earth may be my favorite album but I'm hesitant to say that because I love all of them so much haha.
TheStrokes,2yuxil,TheEricBana,9,Fri Mar 13 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"And this is probably one of the coolest Strokes live videos of them performing it  The colors, the wind, the delay on the vocals. It feels so epic, so apocalyptic."
TheStrokes,2yuxil,nichts_neues,6,Fri Mar 13 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"It's the most complex song they've done. Every instrument is out there. The bass, drums the guitars hallelujah. Jukians voice to top it all off."

TheStrokes,2yuxil,Volcomplaya3,6,Sat Mar 14 00:37:30 2015 UTC,This thread gave me goosebumps because the song is just THAT good.
TheStrokes,2yuxil,Zombotron_,5,Fri Mar 13 12:50:59 2015 UTC,My favorite part besides the cutoff at the end and the amazing solo in the middle are Jules's vocals when he sings: Am I a prisoner to instincts? Or do my thoughts just live as free and detached as boats to the dock?
TheStrokes,2yuxil,cold_a,3,Fri Mar 13 21:39:30 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite for a lot of reasons. A huge one being that it alludes from Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (i like to think)!!  ""I think i know what you mean but watch what you say 'cause they'll be tryna knock you down in some way"" censorship & the State  ""how disappointed would the D.I.D.I.P.P. be..."" censorship  ""you're sad but you smile it's not in your eyes your eyeballs won't change it's the muscles around your eyes"" they watch you, record you, control you, so you can't act different, or else. the State.  ""am i a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live as free and detached as boats to the dock?""  ""is your free time to free minds  or for falling apart?""  basically citizens asking each other/themselves 'am i allowed to think freely? what should i do? this isn't supposed to happen' individualism is frowned upon, so they worry about consequence and themselves.  ""sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep how do you wake someone up from inside a dream?""  the intake of soma to avoid free-thinking and real life emotions is kinda prevalent in the book. the question in this lyric is probably from John the Savage to his mother, who took too much soma, and stayed in her little ""dream"", never waking up.  THE END IS MY FAVORITE PART because the censorship is strong. he gets interrupted. the entire last stanza is awesome  ""fury to tranquilize"" alluding to the soma again ""cities to vapori-"" censorship/punishment? because he spoke too much  OR maybe this song is just alluding from 1984 OR it's just about the real US and other countries in general - capitalism, materialism, NSA spies, desensitization through media and materialism, and basic mind-control from the government in order to distract us while they use us for their selfish, terrible, destructive deeds. modern dystopia.   anyway this song is just fucking amazing and real and i'm glad i got to see jules perform this with the voidz back in november!! i LOVED it"
TheStrokes,2yuxil,symphony64,3,Sun Mar 15 12:19:07 2015 UTC,That solo is like a piece of fucking classical music. God bless AHJ.

TheStrokes,2yuxil,Nauje,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:13:42 2015 UTC,It's in my top three for sure. It was the song that had the most immediate and the most lasting impact from FIOE for me. Over the years FIOE really fell out of favor with me. I've come to accept it as an album with some of their best stuff and some of their worst stuff. Ize is top notch. It would be a great song in any band's catalog.

TheStrokes,2yu3ls,Julian_Turner,13,Fri Mar 13 01:03:53 2015 UTC,I submitted Machu Picchu. I figure it's a good balance between one of my favorite songs and one that actually would have a chance to get on the game.

TheStrokes,2yrxjw,dreamshoes,8,Thu Mar 12 11:15:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh... this reminds me of an idiotic review I read that bashed this song's lyrics. Something like, ""Casablancas claims he has 'nothing to say' in the chorus, but the verses suggest otherwise,"" as if that wasn't, y'know, the whole point. One of many asinine, band-wagoning reviews that unfairly picked apart this great album."
TheStrokes,2yrxjw,Squigi_Luigi,5,Fri Mar 13 20:08:17 2015 UTC,Sums up my thought too. Just alright.

Love this songs bare production... The minimalism is just so great."
TheStrokes,2yrxjw,kekewewe,5,Thu Mar 12 12:05:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I really like that lyric too. I feel like he's referring to having a desire to achieve a goal but not applying yourself or having the courage to accomplish it.
TheStrokes,2yrxjw,dreamshoes,5,Thu Mar 12 16:59:10 2015 UTC,I'd like to watch  I'd like to read  I'd like a part  I'd like the lead
TheStrokes,2yrxjw,kekewewe,4,Fri Mar 13 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know the story of how he came up with this song? I remember reading it in an interview not too long ago. Jules said he dreamed about a band on TV singing a song that had the lyrics ""I've got nothing to say"" and when he woke up he realized there wasn't actually a song like that. I thought that was so interesting. Wish I could find the source."

Just my thoughts. What do I know?"
TheStrokes,2yrxjw,SoaringMuse,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"I dislike this song. Not as much as 15 Minutes though. Jesus. It's one of the songs that, if cut, would have made First Impressions a much stronger album IMO."

TheStrokes,2yrjg5,goth_bacon,2,Thu Mar 12 22:57:17 2015 UTC,Same as you for B-sides.  My favorite covers are Julian's live cover of Bruce Springsteen's Dancing in the Dark or GBV's A Salty Salute.
TheStrokes,2yrjg5,greatestape,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:35:23 2015 UTC,Favorite B-Side: 'Modern Girls and Old Fashioned Men'. I thought Regina Spektor and The Strokes were going to take over the world when I heard this song.   Least Favorite B-Side: 'Life's A Gas'. Some bands just can't be covered very well.   Favorite Cover: 'A Salty Salute'. I didn't really know anything about Guided By Voices until the Strokes started talking about them all the time in interviews.

TheStrokes,2yg8m8,SoaringMuse,6,Tue Mar 10 15:43:13 2015 UTC,God how much does pop punk suck...
TheStrokes,2yg8m8,Nauje,6,Mon Mar 9 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly i dont think it sucks, that is a very narrow minded kind of thinking. A reason why a lot of my friends dislike pop punk is because a lot of them (same goes for me) associate it with the blunder years/cringe years in our life or the scene/emo thing.  Sum 41 actually loved the Strokes and acknowledged their growing popularity. I remember seeing a documentary of them mentioning the Strokes."
TheStrokes,2yg8m8,FIDLAAR,3,Tue Mar 10 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"It's not like I dislike Sum 41 because they ""might"" have disliked the Strokes aha, though you are partially right about the scene/emo thing. But there's more than that.   I just don't like how similar nearly every pop punk song sounds nearly exactly the same, just with a few changes here in there. It's basically palm-muted power chords to power chords to maybe a more softly played bridge to yet another power chord massacre. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a band having power chords as their core sound (e.g Nirvana) but the way pop punk bands utilise them nearly the same way nearly all the time is just... boring.   There's a few more reasons too, such as the lack of use of any different tone in their guitars in all of their songs, as well as their lyrics and how little 'punk' there is in pop punk, but I'll just bore you. I just don't like pop punk at all. I have friends who do and I'm fine with that, I just can't get myself to enjoy Blink-182 or Green Day or in this case Sum 41."
TheStrokes,2yg8m8,Nauje,3,Tue Mar 10 07:24:14 2015 UTC,"i understand your distaste in this type of music because of the the non-punk, the superficialness of it, and the overproduce vocals. I once disliked this genre because of that but I am little new to the rock genre (3 years in) and barely got a little taste of pop punk (Sum 41 was the only of the pop punk i listen to in my early years)  Basically i sorta gotten into 2 other pop punk (Blink and Green Day, only their early works) because they appeared couple months ago on /r/music on the front page. Also, FIDLAR, cited Blink 182 as the influence, that also caught my attention to listen to some Blink. Thats my two cent."

TheStrokes,2yci2j,wankers_remorse,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:09:04 2015 UTC,that would defeat the purpose though. nardwuar's whole thing is getting genuine reactions out of people that other interviewers can't or won't

TheStrokes,2yci2j,23DAD,8,Mon Mar 9 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"I was 15 and a sophomore in high school around 2001-2002. I remember hearing their song on MTV 2(they'd play the more rock centric music) at like midnight one night... My girlfriends mom at the time had their album and we'd listen to it fairly often. Went out and bought a shirt with their logo on it shortly after. A lot of the kids I hung out with were in bands and fancied themselves rockers .. And I remember they kept saying ,'they play the same chords.. And the drummer is playing such a simple beat!' They weren't big fans ... But they weren't big fans of anything that was getting air time on mtv2 or on the radio either. Nothing could have stopped me from lovin their sound and song writing. The melodies on 'hard to explain' were buried in my brain and wouldn't leave. They way I remember it.. Music kind of changed after that album.. Or maybe it changed for me.. There were a lot of bands trying to do something similar as the strokes were with their sound.. A lot of bands that came after the strokes success were 'packaged' like the strokes.. In the way the dressed and the hype behind them. I remember hearing those songs on that album at that time in 2002 and thinkin I had never heard anything that sounded quite like that.. And although a lot of time has passed since then, that album still holds a special place for me. I still play that shit on my record player every once and while"
TheStrokes,2yci2j,SoaringMuse,3,Sun Mar 8 20:27:05 2015 UTC,"God I can't stand the tools that disparage music that don't sound like Tool. Complexity is not always a good thing, as I'm sure you'd agree :)  That's a cool story though, I wish I knew The Strokes when I was younger."

TheStrokes,2yci2j,THE-1138,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:41:54 2015 UTC,Have you heard the radio documentary about the Strokes? That's a really good one. One of the big things to remember about the Strokes though is that they were popular but they were also hated a lot for some reason. It was very strange. They were extremely divisive for some reason. I believe it's because they were so unique. They went against the grain of everyone at the time.. and it's why they were attacked by so many.

She wanna be admired.  You say ""please don't make this harder.""  No, I won't yet.

TheStrokes,2xzpi7,tobymanhattan,3,Thu Mar 5 06:02:28 2015 UTC,The P-94 is just a P-90 in a humbucker sized casing. There is literally no difference in sound. It's just cosmetic.
TheStrokes,2xzpi7,greatestape,3,Thu Mar 5 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's also a hotter pickup actually. I forget if it's wound more or tighter (been a while), but it breaks up a good bit earlier than a P90."

TheStrokes,2xzpi7,Junnie77,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"Nick's guitar has a unique sound because semi-hollow body ES style guitars typically have humbuckers. Putting P-94s in his Riviera was a genius move. I have an Elitist Casino with P-90s and I can pretty much nail the ITI/ROF tones. It's slightly different because the Casino is a hollow body. The P-90 on a solid body sounds quite different, which is very noticeable the few times Nick has used the Les Paul Jr. live instead of his Riviera. Honestly, if you can afford it or are patient enough to save up, buy a Gibson ES-335 and put P-94s in it. The headstock and the bridge will be different, but you'll have a quality guitar. Get yourself a Fender amp and the Jekyll and Hyde pedal and you'll have Nick's sound."
TheStrokes,2xzpi7,perfuume,2,Fri Mar 6 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"Every now and then you can find 90s rivieras on eBay for a few hundred dollars with small issues. I bought one with a neck repair for $250 about 5 years ago and threw some P94s in it.  I've also owned a standard Valensi Riviera so I can comment on the differences. The pickups are the most obvious difference. The 90s Rivieras came with humbuckers and the Valensi comes with single coils (P94s). The 90s Rivieras are good, but the build quality of the Valensi I had seemed much better than the 90s Riviera. It could have been because the Riviera I purchased was used and abused though. Also, I found the neck on the Valensi much larger than the neck on the 90s Riviera, but only because the 90s Riviera had he tiniest neck of any guitar I've ever owned.   If you can find the standard or elitist model, buy it. They're great guitars and the chances of them ever being made again are very slim. I wish I had kept mine instead of selling it."
TheStrokes,2xzpi7,SkyFall96,3,Thu Mar 5 19:06:12 2015 UTC,The struggle is real man. I've been looking for one for the past two months and maybe a couple have popped up and go quick. I check everyday in the mornings and evenings. I think I am just going to buy a Riviera and just put P 94s on it.
TheStrokes,2xzpi7,perfuume,2,Thu Mar 5 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"I got one about ten years ago, still my favorite guitar that I've ever played. I kinda wish I spent extra to get the Elitist one, because the finish is way better. Mine (the standard) is a bit more on the orangey side (""antique natural""), and the Elitist edition is like old-looking wood (""natural""), a lot closer to Nick's, if not identical. I am hoping Epi will start reissuing Rivieras in the near future, they are great guitars. (they do have Rivieras still, but they are the ones with those huge unnecessary whammy bars, and one with no trapeze bridge that comes in sunburst only. bleh!) You said you wanted a new guitar, you might be out of luck, you might only be able to find a Valensi used nowadays. Good luck in your search. If you find one, give it a good home."

TheStrokes,2xxtlq,Cuntosaurus,19,Wed Mar 4 19:36:04 2015 UTC,I think the reason it didn't get 'bigger' is that it takes a few listens to really appreciate the genius of the record. Imo if the critics reviewed it after maybe a month of owning tyranny it might be better received. To me it didn't just live up to the hype but surpassed all expectations especially after the awful sounding youtube videos of the voidz performances pre-album release.
TheStrokes,2xxtlq,roomonfire26,15,Wed Mar 4 20:49:19 2015 UTC,If the Strokes can't sell millions of records anymore there's no way Tyranny was going to be a hit. The record is deliberately noncommercial. Julian even said he wanted to alienate people with the Voidz' music. It worked.

TheStrokes,2xxtlq,electricdinosaur1990,28,Thu Mar 5 02:03:37 2015 UTC,"I think the big reason it isn't more popular comes down to the fact that the record is aesthetically and thematically strange and abrasive and ultimately too honest and complicated for most people's taste. I think, at least speaking for Americans, most people expect music to simply be pleasurable and easily digestable and comforting and forgetable and not disturbing thoughts about the more complex and challenging problems of modern society that linger with them long after they've stopped listening. Tyranny is a record that requires patience and an open mind to music being dark and dystopic and haunting and often times clawing and thrashing at whoever is listening.   On this record, Julian is practically ripping the hair out of his head, completely deranged, screaming at the top of his lungs, pointing our attention at all the horrible shit in modern capitalism that we all know is morally horrendous, and yet we all collectively shrug our shoulders at and say ""what are you gonna do?"": sweatshop & child labor: ""The customer is obviously oblivious and wrong"" & ""It saves me 2 dollars if kids do the work"", overconsumption of natural resources and unrestrained sprawl leading to collapse: ""When man has conquered the earth he will have destroyed himself. His appetite will devour the earth and leave behind only a desert"", greed and worshiping of money: ""put money in my hand and i will do the things you want me to"", corrupt politicians: ""Feeding on your nightmares to procure"" & ""Come meet the ventriloquist who puppets my eye, He is the creepiest guy in the sky. & ""ceremony or a speech, in a church or on a beach, predators eat."", broader swipes at the tragedy of the human condition: ""Our bodies crave a lot of things that end in loss"", and then ultimately fear of revolution and/or the fucking apocalypse: ""Can we shake it up in time? I don't know.//Destroy it. Just destroy it.//Burn it down, to the ground"" & ""Will the sky open up and destroy everyone I loved?"". All the while, Julian sings these lyrics with a mad desperation, as if he were shouting ""Am I the only one who's seeing how fucked up all this is???"", pleading against our collective indifference to all of this. Back in 2006, Julian sang on First Impressions of Earth, ""Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep. How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?""; Tyranny is his answer to that question. You get dirty and nasty and aggressive to break people out of their comfort zone.  Now, whatever your political stances on these issues are, there's no denying that these are downright terrifying problems to think about. There's no way in hell a record like Tyranny would makes its way into pop culture. Not when people can escape into Taylor Swift's rich person's fantasy-land vision of New York. This is soooo much easier than having to think about all these impossible problems, much less actually confront them with organized action. So while we're all busy selfishly relieving the daily frustrations of our own personal lives by vicariously living through whichever pop artist's bullshit comfort music, Julian will be off in some alleyway around the corner, screaming his fucking heart out into a loudspeaker, singing the painful truths that we don't want to hear and hoping, praying, that he isn't alone, that people will scream back with him."

TheStrokes,2xxtlq,ThroatySteak,5,Wed Mar 4 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"I love Tyranny because it has such a unique sound. I think Julian can be somewhat stifled creatively within the bounds of The Strokes (as much as I love them). The Strokes could NEVER release an album that sounds like Tyranny. In fact, no one could and no one has. While parts of it can be somewhat shocking or abrasive, it's really a groundbreaking album sonically & compositionally. It lends itself extremely well to repeated listens.  I think its underwhelming critical reception is partially because there isn't a big enough overlap between Strokes fans and Voidz fans. Tyranny definitely has a narrower appeal, so I'm sure a lot of Strokes fans were bemused and disappointed by it, but as a separate entity it really speaks volumes for itself."
TheStrokes,2xxtlq,terodactylsoros,7,Wed Mar 4 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"I can only speak to my thoughts on it, but Tyranny definitely took a few listens to ""get"", and if I wasn't such a fan of Julian's other solo work and the Strokes in general I might not have given it the second chance that I did. It's a very indulgent record and that can often turn people away, and in this case I think it Julian just made a somewhat polarizing record, especially for people like myself who were hoping for something more immediate along the lines of ""Phrazes"".  After some time, however, Tyranny has ultimately grown on me."
TheStrokes,2xxtlq,kekewewe,14,Thu Mar 5 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of the greatest compositional achievements in history. If Julian had lived hundreds of years ago, he would be rivals with the likes of Mozart or Tchaikovsky. Tyranny is absolutely brilliant, and the hipster side of me is glad that it just has a sort of cult following. If it was commercially successful, there would just be more people going ""omg this sux"" because it is way beyond their capacity."

I just know that the more I learn about music, the more appreciative I become of all forms of it. Sorry if I come off as pretentious, but I feel very passionately about this sort of thing.

TheStrokes,2xlyd7,goth_bacon,20,Sun Mar 1 23:17:19 2015 UTC,Tyranny because Human Sadness.
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,8494,13,Mon Mar 2 04:39:14 2015 UTC,I've gone as far to say it's the best song Julian Casablancas has ever made
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,kekewewe,2,Mon Mar 2 16:16:31 2015 UTC,very much agreed
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,Minerali,14,Tue Mar 3 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"Tyranny flows way better imo, and there are songs in phrazes that I can't stand. I prefer the raw, gritty sound of Tyranny instead of Phrazes' poppy, overproduced one."
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,fagdrew4l,11,Mon Mar 2 00:49:31 2015 UTC,I like Phrazes better because it just flows together as a album and the songs as a whole better.  When I listen to Tyranny I really like it but then I realize I like it so much because I'm skipping like 4 songs when there aren't any songs on Phrazes I don't like.  Plus I think Phrazes is cleaner all together mainly because it's much easier for me to hear the lyrics.
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,rminicozzi,9,Sun Mar 1 23:24:28 2015 UTC,tyranny
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,kekewewe,8,Mon Mar 2 02:20:22 2015 UTC,Phrazes.
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,kekewewe,6,Mon Mar 2 04:24:57 2015 UTC,"Tyranny by far. It is much more complex, personal and raw than Phrazes. Been listening to Tyranny daily since it came out and still sounds fresh and interesting. Human Sadness is truly a masterpiece and IMO the best song Jules has ever written. Other favorites include Nintendo Blood, Crunch Punch, and Xerox but I really enjoy the album as a whole. Even Off to War grew on me.  Phrazes is still really good but I'd rank some of the Strokes albums before it. Although I do really love Left and Right in the Dark. I rarely see that listed as a favorite but it's been my fav off the album for a long time. Always have to replay it once it gets to the end, my mind just wants to hear it again. Always made me feel better about life knowing that even Jules isn't sure where he's going."
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,GreatWalker,3,Mon Mar 2 13:27:45 2015 UTC,hey left and right is my fave too!
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,Julian_Turner,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:08:19 2015 UTC,awesome! glad I'm not alone. Wish I could see that song live again and 4 Chord. Holy shit 4 Chord was amazing live. But both don't really fit into the Tyranny playlist.
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,superhands91,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:51:49 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu1rxeIRxk4  Enjoy.

TheStrokes,2xlyd7,Volcomplaya3,5,Sun Mar 1 23:41:36 2015 UTC,I would say Phrazes because although I love a lot of songs on tyranny I find a few of them quite disjointed and sort of hectic on the ears. Human sadness is probably my favourite song out of all of them but Phrazes is amazing start to finish.   Top 5:   Human Sadness Out of the Blue 11th Dimension Nintendo Blood Glass
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,B0JACK,4,Mon Mar 2 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"Tyranny by far. It has more ""standout"" songs like Human Sadness, Johan Von Bronx, Dare I Care, Father Electricity and Crunch Punch. It's way more memorable too."
TheStrokes,2xlyd7,Underdog76,6,Mon Mar 2 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"I would've said Phrazes a few months ago, I thought Tyranny was too hectic, I didn't like it all that much when it was released. I've been listening to Tyranny a lot more recently, from beginning to ending, and It really has grown on me. I knew there had to be a reason people were giving the album 8+/10. So ya Tyranny."

It probably would be difficult to just jump into the song like that. I was just thinking recently how I wish they would play 80s Comedown Machine live. One of my favorites off that album."
TheStrokes,2x65qj,bloodslide,17,Wed Feb 25 23:33:25 2015 UTC,"This song is to the strokes as ""I'm waiting for my man"" is to the Velvet Underground.  It is a perfect example of The Strokes' brilliant minimalist production - if you listen to the early modern age EP it has a solo and a descending guitar line before the chorus hits. The Strokes reduced it to the bare essentials for the final cut.  In the second verse (after the chorus) Albert's guitar hits harmonics all around the guitar for a sort of 'digital feel' to it. Absolutely genius way of employing harmonics, turns a standard one to five blues progression into a more reckless rendition by making sound seem out of place.  Most daringly, Julian had no reservations about writing a song about wanting to bang a barely legal chick even with the knowledge of the sexual allegations against his father. This is what makes the song so cool in my opinion, it's so brash and unforgiving - yet it still has one of the most chill and relaxed choruses.  The chorus actually slows down in tempo the first time around, and later picks up in speed with Fab hammering down on the drums double time or whatever. Honestly one of the best songs"
TheStrokes,2x65qj,Tron9510,6,Thu Feb 26 05:40:25 2015 UTC,Very nice breakdown. This is the kind of stuff I hoped for when I started song of the week. Excellent work!

TheStrokes,2wzbs2,Interpolice,6,Tue Feb 24 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but there's gotta be a story behind it
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,blackbirdblackquill,19,Tue Feb 24 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"According to genius.com (http://genius.com/898112), ""Tennessee Williams wrote ‘A Streetcar Named Desire.’ In the play, Stanley, in a drunken mess, goes to Stella’s place and proceeds to scream her name. Anyway, Julian can’t do what Stanley does because he expects his girl to let him down"".   I would ask Julian what he meant by ""I feel so different now, we trained at AVA"" in The Modern Age."
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,SoaringMuse,19,Tue Feb 24 15:37:00 2015 UTC,YES!! That AVA line has been bothering me for a long term. Audio visual arts?? Wtf is AVA and what does it meeaaaan
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,Kilospher,12,Tue Feb 24 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"I remember watching a live performance where Julian sang ""we trained in AVIATION"", so perhaps AVA is short for Aviation?"
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,bloodslide,8,Tue Feb 24 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"Biggest mystery. He's sang 'Aviation' in many live performances.   No ones figured it out, but I believe I have a lead (fucking Sherlock Holmes here ..)  I remember an old interview, is this it era, where the interviewer says ""so you guys met in combat training class"" (or something to that effect). I tried to find a connection to Aviation, combat training, but nothing."
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,trying_my_luck,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:02:11 2015 UTC,the songs about drugs so aviation is pretty fitting
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,THE-1138,2,Tue Feb 24 23:14:46 2015 UTC,I thought I heard AVA was some club in New York they played at or some word play on the name of a club.
TheStrokes,2wzbs2,ill_gotten_gains,10,Thu Feb 26 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that Human Sadness is about Julian's relationship with his father, and how he is trying to not make the same mistakes that his father did, now that he himself is a father.   From Genius:   ""Wanted you... didn't ask for nothing, Wait for you on and on""   He has been neglected and hurt and wants to move away from the relationship but he finds it very hard to do so, probably because he still cares about him/her. That is why he appeals to the field beyond right and wrong to put an end to this dualistic and tortured relationship, the only place where ‘they’ could finally leave their troubles behind by also leaving behind their selves.  The feelings expressed fit quite well with the idea that the relationship it deals with is one between father and son since, as the song seems to suggest, it’s a realtionship quite uneven in terms of power and particularly hard to break apart from.   ""Not your son, not your friend, not your enemy""   Here he is expressing an idea similar to the one in the last part of verse two, and we find evidence that at least one of the relationships that the song deals with is between father and son.  He states again how cut off he is from his father. He doesn’t consider himself his son or friend; he doesn’t feel anything at all for him, not even hatred or antagonism.  ""My father was never much of a father to me and it really fucked me up. I never want Cal (Julian’s son) to think of me that way."" – Julian Casablancas    ""Soft skin,  Weak chin,  Just walk me thru it, tell me what to do I'll do   Hurry hurry, that's my baby  Ohh, do what you can.""   This part of the song speaks about the birth of Cal Casablancas, Julian’s son.  A shift of focus from the relationship between Julian and his father to the one he has with his little kid is clearly perceived. He doesn’t want to make the same mistakes his father made. Which is best illustrated when he sings, presumably, to his son: “Hurry hurry, that’s my baby ohh, do what you can.” As well as later on the same verse when having switched back to his relationship with his father sings “Show me where to go don’t get angry so quickly”.   ""Hits you on the head when nobody's there,  Then he says, ""come here could you fix my tie?""   His father shunned him or neglected him “hits on you on the head” and then later says “Could you fix my tie?”  It could mean that his father never really treated him as a son, more like a pawn and him fixing his own grown father’s tie is sort of sad, in a way. Or since these two statements are polar, it could symbolize the bipolar attitude of his father to him.   ""Show me where to go, don't get angry so quickly""   Tying in with the abusive father theme of this song, Julian wants his father to guide him through life instead of being so quick to be mad"

TheStrokes,2wvo0p,Celebrity292,5,Tue Feb 24 16:53:51 2015 UTC,Life is Simple in the Moonlight has been on repeat for a couple weeks now for me. It's such a peaceful and calming song.

TheStrokes,2wvo0p,redvelveteenrabbit,2,Wed Feb 25 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"Recently it was Barely Legal, Alone Together, and take or leave it. Basically i gained appreciation for the first album and every single one of its song.  Now i ve been obsessing over Room on Fire. Song i ve been listening a lot is I cant win and whatever happened is just very ear-wormy as it keeps playing in my head (especially that one part ""i wanna be forgetten, i dont wanna be reminded"" idk if lyrics is accurate but yea)"
TheStrokes,2wvo0p,FIDLAAR,2,Mon Feb 23 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"Whatever Happened. That song is my most played song ever, and I still air guitar the solo every time. I don't think I will ever tire of it!"

TheStrokes,2wuel5,bloodslide,24,Mon Feb 23 05:46:05 2015 UTC,Id rather them make a different and unique album than make something generic sounding like the foo fighters. But I think I get most of what youre saying....
TheStrokes,2wuel5,clonemusic,6,Mon Feb 23 07:30:41 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Music is always better when the artists believe in what they're doing, which is why I love Tyranny so much.  If you listen to a lot of the generic pop-rock on the radio right now, you'll hear how uninspired most of it is."
TheStrokes,2wuel5,jibelite,10,Mon Feb 23 15:30:15 2015 UTC,I personally don't want another Is This It styled record or anymore Angles/Comedown Machine era sound.. Maybe blend them or experiment with them like Tyranny did. I honestly don't want them to make another record unless they all really are in it.
TheStrokes,2wuel5,Cuntosaurus,8,Mon Feb 23 06:02:01 2015 UTC,"Most Foo Fighters songs sound the same. They are an example of not evolving much as band or changing their sound. Personally I really enjoyed Comedown Machine and if people don't they aren't giving it enough of a chance.   The Strokes are a really big band. So I wouldn't think of them as ""tiny"". There is a huge following and even Julian and Albert solo can bring in a large crowd.    I don't really care what the majority thinks of the Strokes albums, they have their fans and still getting more. I've come across a bunch of high school kids (at signings and shows) that are into the Strokes proving that people are still finding out about them and enjoying their music.   As far as the Arctic Monkeys, they sold out big time. I have a theory that they didn’t write their latest album because it sounds sooo much different than Alex Turner’s style. They at least had a lot of outside help. I used to like their new cd but I haven’t listened to it in like almost a year. I grew really tired of it."
TheStrokes,2wuel5,kekewewe,6,Mon Feb 23 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think ""massive"" and ""tiny"" are actually descriptions of their relative sounds, not their followings. Songs like 12:51 and Someday are simple, well-written, tight, and pretty much as good as pop music gets. But if that gets followed up by Everlong, it makes the previous song sound like it was simple, in a bad way. That was my reading of what Nick was talking about."
TheStrokes,2wuel5,SoaringMuse,2,Mon Feb 23 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"This is indeed what he was saying in the context of the article.  Another example of this is Dr. Luke, writer of pop super-hits such as Since You Been Gone And other successful singles. With since you been gone, he wrote it by thinking ""what if cool bands like the strokes made really huge choruses?"" And next thing you know, that song was one of the biggest of the past ten or so years.  The Strokes never were into huge choruses until First Impressions, but then they ditched that achievement for a retrogressive 80s throwback album (angles) followed by a Michael Jackson influenced rock album .."
TheStrokes,2wuel5,SoaringMuse,2,Mon Feb 23 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh my bad I didn't read the article. It IS the choruses that stick to most people, and even ones like the Reptilia chorus aren't memorable enough for the average radio listener. If they pumped out YOLO sooner or had one ""sell-out"" song they'd be bigger in the US.   They're pretty huge in Europe though afaik, so in a way it's more of the US audience's tastes than it is The Strokes's ""fault"" for not making it bigger."
TheStrokes,2wuel5,greatestape,5,Mon Feb 23 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude, but the Alex Turner wrote AM. Go to the ASCAP site and look it up. The Strokes had their moment and it was awesome, but they were never going to be massive.   https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx"
TheStrokes,2wuel5,SoaringMuse,2,Mon Feb 23 21:57:52 2015 UTC,U/soaringmuse I may have fucked up my response with that Dr. Luke tangent .. But what I meant is that your explanation of Nick's quote is correct.
TheStrokes,2wuel5,manualex16,1 point,Tue Feb 24 06:31:28 2015 UTC,What do you mean? The Since You've Been Gone thing?
TheStrokes,2wuel5,TakinR,3,Wed Feb 25 21:20:14 2015 UTC,If they did the sounds of the 70's(ITI&ROF) and the 80's (Angles & CM) and something In-between(FIOE) why not go for that 90's sound for the next two albums?

TheStrokes,2wq1nt,goth_bacon,19,Sun Feb 22 10:33:36 2015 UTC,"WHAT?! Vision of Division?  Listen, okay I know it's a subreddit and these are people with opinions and I can't change that. But honestly Vision of Division is my absolute favorite song, from Nikolai's thumping bassline throughout, to Albert's FANTASTIC fucking solo (also my favorite solo off of any album) mixed with Julian's raspy ""How long must I waiiiiiiiiiiiiiaiiiaiit"" ughhh <333 It's so good.  I would've expected Fear of Sleep (great song instrumentally, but the lyrics are so dull)  But just my opinion, not bashing, Vision of Division is the song I start my day off with oh my goodness."
TheStrokes,2wq1nt,I_Miss_Claire,2,Sun Feb 22 20:15:23 2015 UTC,I'll give it another shot because of this post!
TheStrokes,2wq1nt,goth_bacon,13,Mon Feb 23 13:51:06 2015 UTC,I agree with a lot of these. But I'm actually floored you said River of Brakelights. Probably the best non-Strokes song Jules has ever put out.
TheStrokes,2wq1nt,Interpolice,2,Sun Feb 22 20:54:19 2015 UTC,That whole album is amazing.

TheStrokes,2wq1nt,Vewdew_Child,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:18:49 2015 UTC,"I used to dislike River of Brakelights, in fact I would skip it within the first ten seconds of the song. Once I listened to the chorus ""I'm AAAATTTT your FEEEEEEET..."" and I was hooked on it.   I still like it."

TheStrokes,2wq1nt,DraperWhite,10,Sun Feb 22 02:58:44 2015 UTC,I used to not be a huge fan of 80's Comedown Machine until I sat down and listened to the album on vinyl with some nice speakers. I was jamming to the first four tracks and then 80's Comedown Machine comes on and I'm couch locked mesmerized. 50/50 brings you back up and then Slow Animals back down. Comedown Machine!

TheStrokes,2vkuqk,Walksonthree,2,Wed Feb 11 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ugh he hard to explain video made me so frustrated the first time I saw it. I was like ""OK where's the pattern, wheres this video headed. Cars, OK, driving...rockets? Taking off? WHAT"" I like it now though :p"
TheStrokes,2vkuqk,penayzee,7,Thu Feb 12 10:47:20 2015 UTC,"One time a friend, who is also a big Strokes fan, and I drank and watched all the Strokes music videos on a college classroom projector and reviewed each one after watching it. Much like one would drink and watch a football game on a big screen and talk during the commercials. Someday brought the feels. Had a blast, 10/10 would do it again."
TheStrokes,2vkuqk,Cowboys2410,5,Thu Feb 12 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"Reptilia is a great one, but You Only Live Once will always be my favorite. One of my favorites regardless of the artist."

TheStrokes,2vkuqk,itsgottopass,3,Thu Feb 12 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"My fave is 12:51. It just fits so well with the 80s vibe of the song. All the Time is a copout of a video but still gives me the feels. Taken for a Fool is fun to rewatch; so much going on. YOLO as well. This is when Julian starts being less self conscious/serious in videos and starts with the dance moves and faces. Both Juicebox and Yolo have him miming uh, oral love haha."
TheStrokes,2vkuqk,goth_bacon,2,Thu Feb 12 01:06:27 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of the alternate YOLO video.

TheStrokes,2vh2q1,Grobbyman,20,Tue Feb 10 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely last nite, but really that opinion only stands because it's their most overplayed radio song. Also I sincerely dislike 'all the time' that song just sounds like them mocking themselves"
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,kaleidoscope_ize,7,Wed Feb 11 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really fair to say Last Nite is overrated. It is the song that brought them to fame and made them an international sensation. I'll admit it is definitely the most played, but without it they may have only wound up having regional success as opposed to worldwide."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,GarciaLater,3,Wed Feb 11 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"I've never actually heard last nite on the radio! I just can't understand how it's one of their most popular songs. I agree even though it's not too popular, all the time, sounds like they're trying to hard to please their old school fans. which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was just executed poorly."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,SoaringMuse,2,Wed Feb 11 02:09:43 2015 UTC,They probably were mocking themselves a bit... although it's more similar to Room on Fire than Is This It material.
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,TheFacter,5,Fri Feb 13 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"For me it has to be Reptilia. Don't get me wrong it's a solid song and actually has some pretty cool lyrics (""The room is on fiiiire and she's fixin' her haaair"" comes to mind). I just don't feel like it's even in the top 5 songs on Room On Fire, and it's currently number 1 for all of The Strokes' discography on Spotify. It's still a pretty good song, but I just never thought it was that great.  I used to think that Last Nite was overrated too, but it's grown on me over time. Really fun to sing along too and has just the right balance of energy and relaxed vibes."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,TheFacter,6,Wed Feb 11 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one. Yea, I do find myself skipping it occasionally just because of how many times I've heard it. However I do think it deserves the acclaim that it receives!"
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,SoaringMuse,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think I just find it too aggressive. Most Strokes stuff has a nice mix of laid back and ""warm"" sound and a little bit of aggressiveness but Reptilia is just too in my face."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,clonemusic,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:48:51 2015 UTC,I guess it depends what you mean by overrated. Music definitely has a lot of subjective elements but Reptilia is very much a standout song on the album. I just can't see it being overrated given  that it's creatively fresh and uses The Strokes' strengths in really great ways.
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,bobsten,3,Fri Feb 13 02:10:25 2015 UTC,"For me, it's juicebox."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,Interpolice,4,Wed Feb 11 19:46:43 2015 UTC,But it's so damn catchy

TheStrokes,2vh2q1,B0JACK,2,Wed Feb 11 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"Because it's one of the best ""new Strokes"" song."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,goth_bacon,4,Sun Feb 15 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"So many good songs by the Strokes, so I would say the ""overrated"" songs would just be the ones that got the most airtime... So I would say maybe Last Nite or Someday. Maybe even Under the Cover of Darkness. (I know people on this sub seem to love this one)"
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,SoaringMuse,16,Wed Feb 11 02:20:34 2015 UTC,Someday   Get out.  Just kidding.  But get out.
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,SkyFall96,0,Wed Feb 11 13:33:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously Someday is SO good and it doesn't have near the recognition as Last Nite (overrated), Hard to Explain (a bit too...) or Reptilia (actually so fucking good)"
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,TakinR,3,Fri Feb 13 02:08:08 2015 UTC,Hard to Explain deserves every bit of praise that it gets and more.
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,SoaringMuse,1 point,Fri Feb 13 19:43:22 2015 UTC,Hard to Explain is probably only outclassed by other Is This It songs and Reptilia/YOLO. That song is really good.
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,TakinR,2,Sun Feb 15 05:18:56 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a song that helped start a movement but compared to the rest of their work on ITI I don't think it really stands out. I used to be a BIG fan of the song but I've shifted towards other songs on the album, like Alone Together and Trying Your Luck"
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,BioSpock,1 point,Sun Feb 15 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"So basically as I said, it's only outshined by other ITI songs! Hard to Explain would definitely be the best track on albums like Angles or Comedown Machine. It would probably one of the best on Room on Fire and FIOE as well imo. I just feel like Hard to Explain and The Modern Age reflect exactly what the Strokes were at the time of ITI and ROF."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,itsgottopass,3,Sun Feb 15 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"By overrated I don't just mean overplayed. But more unjustly popular, like they don't deserve as much attention as they review! Someday & under the cover of darkness are definitely played a ton, but they are also definitely two of my favorite songs."
TheStrokes,2vh2q1,ThroatySteak,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think Under the Cover of Darkness actually is the best answer. I think that song is largely popular because it was the ""The Strokes are back!"" song. I liked it that Summer but I skip it every time now.   That said I wouldn't mind listening to it now..."

TheStrokes,2vf3xk,goth_bacon,10,Tue Feb 10 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love this song.  It's definitely in my Strokes top ten.  It sounds like something you'd hear in a neon-lit bowling alley, eating crinkle-cut fries and drinking Pepsi with your best friends on a Saturday night in 1989.  Julian's vocals are absolutely on point.  The best part is the humming vocals and the way Julian says ""Hard to take you off of my love"" at 1:45."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,itsgottopass,3,Wed Feb 11 13:32:18 2015 UTC,Perfect bowling alley description.
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,HypnoHipster,8,Thu Feb 12 01:23:29 2015 UTC,One of the couple of songs I like from Angles. It's pretty catchy and I would deff tell a friend to give it a listen if I had to choose Angles.
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,bloodslide,8,Tue Feb 10 15:03:25 2015 UTC,"Whenever the chorus hits, I always feel that the chorus from ""Left and Right in the Dark"" from Jules' solo work could be added"
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,Walksonthree,7,Tue Feb 10 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"As soon as the song first came on I was like ""woah, 80's as shit"". I really like the guitar in the whole track."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,Gadder,7,Wed Feb 11 11:23:34 2015 UTC,"While not a traditional Strokes song (probably the most 80s they've ever sounded), I still love to jam to this song. It actually stood out to me the most when I first listened to Angles and kind of got me started on The Strokes, so I hold it in high regard. Its a very powerful, arena-style song and when the chorus hits, it really pumps you up. I really love the lead guitar after the chorus - so exhilarating"
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,itsgottopass,3,Wed Feb 11 10:22:21 2015 UTC,So 80's! & that's saying something in regards to them. I picture this song playing during the highly emotional part in an 80s teen film. Or maybe the montage.
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,Westykins,5,Thu Feb 12 01:16:56 2015 UTC,One of the few songs I don't like from angles. Not really catchy and I'd tell my friends to stay away from it if they want listen to angles.
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,B0JACK,2,Tue Feb 10 19:38:45 2015 UTC,Word.
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,8494,4,Wed Feb 11 02:23:23 2015 UTC,Sounds kind of like a song by The Cars
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,itsgottopass,2,Tue Feb 10 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"Esp the ""Hard to take you off of my love"" bit. Straight up Ric Ocasek."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,SkyFall96,4,Thu Feb 12 01:22:28 2015 UTC,"I really like the song and the 80's vibe that goes with it. One of my favorites from ""Angles""."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,BioSpock,3,Wed Feb 11 10:20:18 2015 UTC,"To me it's the epitome of the syndrome that a few of the songs on Angles suffer from: a weak/strange opening ~30 seconds. But once you get into this song, damn is it great!"
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,roomonfire26,2,Mon Feb 16 05:43:08 2015 UTC,now that you say it i totally agree!
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,B0JACK,2,Tue Feb 17 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"Bizarre one. i don't mean this in a negative way, but probably one of my least favorite Strokes songs. I have never said to myself: ""You know what song I could really jam to right now? Two Sides of Happiness""  That being said, probably one of their more unique songs."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,BadassBuddusky,2,Wed Feb 11 02:22:30 2015 UTC,The opening sounds like 'Every breath you take' by The Police
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,greatestape,2,Thu Feb 12 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty low on my list of favorites, but it's better than that pile of shit that comes after it- You're So Right!? More like like You're So Wrong! Amirite!? Thanks, I'll be here all week."
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,seriouslyfuckingstop,2,Sun Feb 15 21:52:01 2015 UTC,haha. i've always wondered why people hated on You're So Right so hard. i quite like the layered vocals and the explosion of guitars near the end. but to each his/her own. :)
TheStrokes,2vf3xk,greatestape,2,Mon Feb 16 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's an interesting song and I really dig the guitar solo, but I don't think it fits anywhere on Angles or anywhere in the Strokes catalog. There are some amazing songs on Angles but it really feels like they put that album out just because they had to. Not because they wanted to."
TheStrokes,2vduw3,electricdinosaur1990,4,Tue Feb 10 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, this makes me want another Strokes album. That being said, I'd like Gordon Raphael to come back as producer for The Strokes."

TheStrokes,2va626,Danfilmman,14,Mon Feb 9 08:15:48 2015 UTC,For the lazy:   Slow Animals  Fast Animals  I like Fast Animals better because it's more danceable.
TheStrokes,2va626,Julian_Turner,9,Mon Feb 9 09:05:58 2015 UTC,"I like them both for different reasons. Slow animals has a, I dunno, at home feeling? Its seems more emotional. I also enjoy the drums. I like fast animals' pace and and you can hear the lyrics better. I like the twang of Julian's voice."
TheStrokes,2va626,Walksonthree,8,Mon Feb 9 10:06:26 2015 UTC,i like the instrumental bridge in Fast Animals. but I like the drums and the chorus in Slow Animals.  i guess i like moderately-paced animals.
TheStrokes,2va626,seriouslyfuckingstop,5,Mon Feb 9 10:58:15 2015 UTC,They need to make that... :P
TheStrokes,2va626,kekewewe,2,Mon Feb 9 18:35:11 2015 UTC,I always thought the same thing! I like the verses for Fast Animals but the chorus better for Slow Animals.
TheStrokes,2va626,Gadder,9,Tue Feb 10 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"Both are fantastic and some of my favorite Strokes songs by far. I think out of the two, however, Slow Animals would have to be the superior one. While Fast Animals has that nice simplistic, improvisational feel to it with the MJ beat which makes you want to dance, Slow Animals just carries such depth which is so hard to describe, especially towards the climactic end of the song. It just really hits home for me & I get shivers every time. Something about the layers upon layers of powerful instrumentals and Julian's melancholy falsetto make it really emotionally investing and enjoyable. Plus the laughter at the end always cheers me up :)"
TheStrokes,2va626,thunderball13,6,Mon Feb 9 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, that Slow/Fast Animals is one of the best Strokes songs out there. I find the electronic drum beat in Fast Animals to be slightly less authentic then Slow Animals. It adds an edge which sounds less like classic Strokes and more like a hip-hop beat.

TheStrokes,2uf36g,SkyFall96,2,Sun Feb 1 19:10:30 2015 UTC,I didn't find out until like last week that they released an album in 2014. I heard absolutely nothing about it
TheStrokes,2uf36g,ThroatySteak,7,Sun Feb 1 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"That album is pretty weak if you ask me, I prefer their debut album ""Remember When"". EP ""Other Voices"" is pretty solid too."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,SkyFall96,3,Sun Feb 1 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I really do like ""Remember When"" but I think ""Disgraceland"" is better. One of my favorite albums from 2014."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Cowboys2410,3,Sun Feb 1 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to it much, but I love the Other Voices EP and the song Halloween All Year. I need to check out the rest of Remember When"
TheStrokes,2uf36g,ThroatySteak,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"I agree.   ""double double dare! don't cut your hair!""  so bad..."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Cuntosaurus,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"surprised you guys don't like ""The Righteous One"". It's probably my fav off the record. great stoner song.   I personally really like both albums but the newest one is a bit more produced so I can see how someone might not care for it as much but it doesn't seem like that far off from Remember When."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,7,Mon Feb 2 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"Franz Ferdinand is great, but I wouldn't necessarily call it garage rock."

TheStrokes,2uf36g,AcidOnTheBrain_,8,Sun Feb 1 18:40:28 2015 UTC,interpol sounds more like joy division with strokes-like instrumentals. Still a great band
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Mon Feb 2 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"This band called A Tribute to the Sun from Katy, TX plays garage rock style music, it's a little heavier than some of The Strokes stuff but it wouldn't hurt to check it out for yourself."

TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,2,Mon Feb 2 08:28:12 2015 UTC,Any Spotify users feel free to check out and add to the subreddit's Spotify list.   To suggest a few bands that haven't been mentioned:   Ex Hex  King Tuff  Thee Oh Sees  Deap Vally  The Black Angels  Fuzz  Spanish Gold  Courtney Barnett
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Mon Feb 2 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah, King Tuff's new album is awesome! The LP is only $10 at urban outfitters right now!"
TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"oh wow I had no idea they had it that cheap. I need to pick that up! I love the album! He's great live too. I just saw him a couple weeks ago. I think he's going to be big soon. His other albums are good too. Was Dead, his debut, has a more psychedelic feel to it.    You should check out some of the other artists I mentioned if you haven't before. Ex Hex, Thee Oh Sees, Deap Vally, and the black angels are pretty similar to King Tuff. I recently got into Deap Vally, an all girl duo that's similar to White Stripes/Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Their next cd is going to be produced by the guitarist from YYY."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Tue Feb 3 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"I saw them live too! They played at Walter's Downtown in Houston Texas with the Ex Hex and a local band called Young Mammals, all three were awesome. I haven't ever checked out the Black Angels or Thee Oh Sees, so I'll have to give it a listen. I saw Deap Vally at ACL two years ago and they were pretty good, I don't have any of their music but I liked them. Here's my band, I won't be hurt if you think we suck, but we just put out an EP and The Strokes are one of my favorite bands and you seem to have a very similar taste in music  so I feel like sharing."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"Haha we were at the same show. Was such a kick ass show. Young Mammals was real good too. I was further back for the first 2 artists, then King Tuff came on and I was super close with one person in front of me. Such a high energy show with a crazy crowd.  The Black Angels are from Austin. they are real good, I especially like the album Phosphene Dream.   Your band is pretty good. I really dig the guitar and fuzz feeling. I prefer the songs with more singing. Good to know there's some local bands making good music. It reminded me of Ty Segall a lot at points."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Wed Feb 4 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"Haha that's awesome man, small world. I think I'll be in the music video if they take scenes from that show, I was right up near the front as well. I'm digging The Black Angels, trippy stuff but not too much for me. We're playing this Saturday at Notsuoh if you want to come by and check us out! I think we play around 10PM and it's 5$ cover for 21+ and $8 for everyone else. Two Dollar Pistol is another local band playing with us at Notsuoh, I think you'll dig them too, they've got a really Black Keys kind of vibe."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:58:29 2015 UTC,Cool. I might have to come check y'all out sometime.   Yeah Black Angels is really psychedelic. I've gotten really into psych type rock since Tyranny came out. Helped me appreciate some more types of music. Did you see Julian when he came through town?
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Wed Feb 4 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"Nah I didn't unfortunately. I haven't really given Tyranny a good listen too, I never really liked Julian's solo stuff too much, I've always preferred Albert's solo stuff to Julian's but I'll probably give it another listen sometime soon."
TheStrokes,2uf36g,kekewewe,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:35:36 2015 UTC,Aww you missed out. I met him at a meet and greet before at Cactus Records. It seemed like a lot of people there weren't too familiar with Tyranny. Was an amazing show. Should give the CD another listen. It took me like 4 listens till the melodies got stuck in my head. Now I listen to that album daily.   I really like Albert's solo stuff too. Got to see him last year.
TheStrokes,2uf36g,Big__Muff,2,Wed Feb 4 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"Damn, I wish I went to that, I probably had work/school or something. I'll for sure check out the CD again very soon then. My bassist has seen Albert like 4 times, I'm very jealous :("
TheStrokes,2uf36g,FIDLAAR,2,Thu Feb 5 04:37:05 2015 UTC,Best Friends - Mankind  Best Friends - Dude Love (got that distinct vocals and distortion)  every single one of Best Friends music are pretty fkn good  Fratellis - For the Girl  Broncho - Try me out sometimes (got that garage sound and unique vocals)  Broncho - Class Historian  Total Babes - Tip of my tongue (closest to a strokes sound/got that lofi distortion)  Keel Her - Riot Grrrl (got that nostalgic feel like Someday and lofi distortion as well)  Two Wounded Birds - Together Forever music video is homage to Ramones taping at Arturo Loft plus they are heavily influenced by the Ramones. Bass chick is pretty damn hot. definitely a ten in my books  The Courtneys - 90210 (Got a very 80s/90s and west coast vibe to it and nostalgic vocals/idk if its intentional or not but lyrics rhyme)  Just listen the first 15 seconds of each song. i promise you all will like them

TheStrokes,2uf138,Uneqwill,7,Sun Feb 1 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"All they've announced so far is Florida, Georgia, and Barcelona festivals. It's pretty unlikely considering how little they've toured the past couple years, but it's still very early in the year. I think when they release their next album, they'll go on a massive tour. At least, that's what I want to happen."

TheStrokes,2ue2o7,perfuume,6,Sun Feb 1 14:49:09 2015 UTC,"He did that in 2 or 3 of the festival shows in 2011. I watched every show from 2011 that had a livestream (I'm sure most if not all are on YouTube now) and I remember Julian doing it several times. I'd suggest searching ""strokes 2011 live"" and just checking each performance to see if Last Nite was played. Good luck!"

TheStrokes,2ubz51,IndieKidNotConvert,8,Sat Jan 31 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"I think they also thought about going by The Shitty Beatles too. I remember a video or something where they like ""if there's a band called Van Halen, we could be called More Etti""."

TheStrokes,2ucsio,fivebecomesfour,10,Sat Jan 31 23:48:22 2015 UTC,You mean the synth part? That's not really a big deal. I think I'd rather them do that then bring somebody out to play synth for one song honestly.
TheStrokes,2ucsio,chrisbr500,12,Sun Feb 1 00:53:10 2015 UTC,Would've been cool if Julian played it though
TheStrokes,2ucsio,perfuume,3,Sun Feb 1 03:27:16 2015 UTC,What is the synth part?
TheStrokes,2ucsio,slbto24,6,Sun Feb 1 17:22:32 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying. I feel like it would be a bit strange seeing Julian doing something (on stage) other than singing though.
TheStrokes,2ucsio,chrisbr500,6,Sun Feb 1 04:17:39 2015 UTC,They did a lot of things for the first time during the Angles.
TheStrokes,2ucsio,SkyFall96,3,Sun Feb 1 04:22:20 2015 UTC,"Who cares? It's a part of the song, they (Julian) maybe didn't feel comfortable playing it. It's still music"
TheStrokes,2ucsio,Cuntosaurus,3,Sun Feb 1 17:08:04 2015 UTC,its possible someone was playing the synth off stage too
TheStrokes,2ucsio,Julian_Turner,3,Mon Feb 2 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, wouldn't they want someone playing it live over a backing track? In case the band played the song slower or faster, the live musician could stay in sync with the rest of the guys."
TheStrokes,2ucsio,electricdinosaur1990,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:44:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, ever since FOIE they've been doing things that they can't pull off live...and they said they would never do that."
TheStrokes,2ucsio,greatestape,0,Mon Feb 2 05:52:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say but, almost ever fairly popular band uses backing tracks  its just insurance so that if a band member fucks up, the song still sounds good"

TheStrokes,2uasyc,RichardMagpies,4,Sat Jan 31 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"Here are some really short videos too. They have the $2 bill concert playing in the background on mute, and the lead singer really does sound/look like Julian. They're champs.  NYC Cops   Last Nite"
TheStrokes,2uasyc,ThroatySteak,5,Sat Jan 31 12:39:32 2015 UTC,"This band is pretty good as well. Guy sounds exactly like Julian. Doubt he has the range though, they seem to only cover the old stuff"
TheStrokes,2uasyc,moobilygoobily,2,Sun Feb 1 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you're not kidding, that guy's voice sounds exactly like Julian's.  Rest of the band isn't that great, though - the bassist and the guitarists seem to put a sort of 'twang' that really does not fit with Strokes songs and the drummer is waaaaay too slow. The band is also really quiet compared to the singer."
