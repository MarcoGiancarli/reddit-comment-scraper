ArtefactPorn,3dy5s0,joemangle,5,Mon Jul 20 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"Grease, possibly log rollers, a LOT of guys, simple levers. A lot of it probably involved brute labor, really. Inca stone masons worked with stones ranging from the size of your fist up to behemoths like that and it's thought they just used labor and expertise. It's thought that the process of fitting the stones was very labor intensive, but the results are clear. Many of the best constructions are basically perfectly fitted, and use stones that probably collectively, took years to pick out and finish to fit together.  Because of this they are almost impervious to earthquakes, and in many cases form the foundations of colonial European structures, because nothing the colonists could produce would have been better, and they were already available. Another astonishing thing was how much precious metal they gathered to decorate the imperial complex in Cuzco."
ArtefactPorn,3dy5s0,KruskDaMangled,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the larger stones and boulders the Inca made use of were most likely already at the construction site and were minimally moved.

And being located in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec between two other large cultural regions has resulted in generations of trade, movement, and warfare which changes a populations phenotype (aka appearance). You cannot expect a people to remain static and unchanging.  That being said, whenever comparisons are made saying these heads look like Africans or Polynesians or Southeast Asians they are always being compared to contemporary groups which have also undergone phenotype changes in the last 3000 years.  These heads are modeled how they are because that is how people looked in this region in the past. Perhaps some emphasis was made on the nose and lips because that is what they found attractive. Just as layer Maya people saw an elongated head, large beak nose, and cross eyes attractive.   It's all about context and frames of reference."

But, and it is a big but, there is no strong evidence for such a thing occuring other than the transmission of metallurgical knowledge from South America to West Mexico (no Olmec influence there) sometime around 800 AD.

The tour guides often leave off that in the other corner were a bunch of other skeletons. It seems the classy lady was just trying to avoid the ash and debris.

They were gods alright, and they had tons of stories about them. Dionysus liked wine a lot, but there were a lot of other important things about him, for instance, he's the only God who ages. Apollo is always young and beardless, and zuess is always old. Dionysus has stories and depictions as both a boy and a grown man.   The Greeks wouldn't have thought of him as the ""god of wine,"" or ""the god of theater"" or ""coming of age."" However, because they knew these things were important to him they'd toast to Dionysus whenever they were drinking and invoke him before theater performances."

It may have been religious, but part of the mystery is that it has no simple explanation.  It was made by hunter-gatherers, pre-pottery and pre-animal (except for dog) and plant domestication. It is certainly in the top 10 greatest discoveries of the 20th century, and we have only known about it for about 20 years, with the lead excavator saying he's only uncovered ~5% of the complex. And, as u/VegemiteMate said, it does happen to be only a 45 minute drive to the border of IS held Syria, and a 2 hour drive to Raqqa, their capital.

The people who erected this structure were still hunter and gatherers. And this is not the only circle there, it is suggested that there are at least 20 of such circles.   The carvings on those pillars also lead to the conlusion, that the builders of Gobekli Tepe saw there gods as human like beings. Those gods had authority over the animal realm and nature.  This place was used as a place of worship for thousands of years before the first settlements were founded an grain was cultivated. And when they hadn't had a use for it anymore, they just didn't abandon the place, it was deliberately covered with dirt.  I think this is the most fascinating place on earth right now. The organization needed for nomadic people to erect such structures and the willpower to do it is just mindblowing to me.

Since the terrain was not deemed suitable for a cavalry attack, Leopold's knights dismounted, and because they did not have time to prepare for the engagement, they were forced to cut off the tips of their poulaines which would have hindered their movement on foot. The Swiss chroniclers report how a huge pile of these shoe-tips was found in a heap after the battle, and they are also depicted in the background of the battle scene in the Lucerne Chronicle of 1513.   Most of the Austrians were horribly killed, so I guess the lesson is wear sensible shoes if you're going into battle.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sempach"

Shàojiàn 哨箭  Shàojiàn literally means ""shrieking arrow"". These are all whistling arrows and they have their whistling compartment, called qiāo, behind the arrowhead. All qiāo on shàojiàn are whistles. The whistles are usually made of bone, horn or wood and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most whistling arrows are used for hunting and the whistle is designed to cause a predictable reaction, such as to startle the animal between release and impact. Regulations are often very specific about which arrow to use for which animal, implying that some animals may have responded differently to certain sounds."

Additional dakinis and lamas occupy roundels in the corners. The upper register depicts lamas and mahasiddhas representing the Sakya school’s spiritual lineage. The lower register depicts protective deities and a monk who performs a consecration ritual.

The Minoans have more recently been described as a thalassocracy and, contrary to Evans' beliefs, did have defensive structures like watchtowers (the lack of walls is probably more of a ""this is a remote island"" thing than a ""we are a peace-loving people and have no enemie"" thing). And the complexes at Knossos, Phaistos, etc. were probably government, religious, and community centers all in one--we really still don't know much about them, but we can say that the old model of a centralized redistributive economy and a castle-like building with ""throne rooms"" like the one Evans reconstructed don't seem right anymore.   p.s.

I guess they didn't figure out glass blowing yet, so it was easier?   But generally, you wouldn't want the base to be smaller than the rest that way. It would have been better with no base.   I guess they must have used a sort of press or something? Idk, it is puzzling, because they used to only be able to make flat glass by flattening out blown glass so windows were not great.

The non-chain part is often called Plated mail or Splinted  As you'd probably imagine, they are placed to provide stabbing protection to vital organs. Chainmail is good for slashing motions, but you really want something stronger for stabbing motions, especially in vital areas."
ArtefactPorn,3d9l07,comosayllama,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"Strength of chainmail isn't really the issue when it comes to stabbing weapons, it's the hardness of the armor.  A properly made chainmail will stop most thrusting weapons, but because it is flexible, it would still allow the weapon to transfer a lot of force into the users body in a very localized point.  The metal plates distributes that force better.  It is probably why there are no plates on the chest region as the ribs of a person would do effectively the same."

Having rubbed the oil in, a strigil was used to scrape away any excess as well as any dead skin and dirt. Athletes also used strigils to remove dirt, dust and oil from their bodies after exercise. This was sometimes bottled and sold as a medical treatment called gloios to relieve aches, pains and sprains."

ArtefactPorn,3d80jf,ChodeOfChodeHall,6,Tue Jul 14 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry I misread some things  Pirates often took hostages and made a lot of money that way.  At least the captain might be worth some money.  After fighting most people you should be given quarter if you surrendered.  Under the red flag, if you fight them you are not going to be spared if you try to surrender.  I was assuming they didn't want to deal with having to try and sell off hostages.  Maybe some people would flee in a tender  Really the pirates don't want to get shot at, so they made huge consequences for resistance."

Ross, Jeffrey B. Soref, The Robert T. Wall Family, Dr. and Mrs. Sidney G. Clyman, and Steven Kossak Gifts, 2008  Accession Number: 2008.30  Central African power figures are among the ubiquitous genres identified with African art. Conceived to house specific mystical forces, they were collaborative creations of Kongo sculptors and ritual specialists. This example belongs to the most ambitious class of that tradition, attributed to the atelier of a master active along the coast of Congo and Angola at the end of the nineteenth century and identified with Mangaaka, the preeminent force of jurisprudence. That power was represented as a presiding authority and enforcing lord or king. Its crowning element is the distinctive mpu headdress worn by chiefs or priests. The figure's posture and gesture, leaning forward with hands placed akimbo on the hips, is the aggressive attitude of one who challenges fearlessly. Traces of a missing beard-a sign of seniority-survive in the form of nails along the contours of the chin. There are also vestiges of an abdominal cavity for medicinal matter that originally attracted the figure's defining force. The various metals embedded in the figure's expansive torso attest to its central role as witness and enforcer of affairs critical to its community. They document vows sealed, treaties signed, and efforts to eradicate evil. Ultimately, this work inspired reflection on the consequences of transgressing established codes of social conduct."

(69.8 cm); W. 15 in. (38.1 cm); Wt. 5 lb. 3 oz. (2350 g)  Classification: Equestrian Equipment-Shaffrons  Credit Line: Rogers Fund, 1904  Accession Number: 04.3.253  Label: In the Renaissance, elaborate parade armor of fanciful design was often employed in tournaments, ceremonial entries, and court pageants. This shaffron, shaped as a fierce dragon's head, was made at the end of the fifteenth century, perhaps for the French court, by a Milanese armorer working in Lyon. It is among the earliest surviving examples of parade armor in the ""heroic"" style, which alluded to the heroes of literature and legend. The shaffron was redecorated in 1539 with gold-damascened motifs including a fleur-de-lis, the letter H, and dolphins, indicating that it was refurbished for use by the French dauphin Henry (1519–1559), who assumed the throne as Henry II in 1547. The shaffron can probably be associated with the ceremonies connected with the tour of France made by Emperor Charles V in 1539, during which the dauphin was in constant attendance. The reuse of an older piece of armor, redecorated for this occasion, suggests that there was considerable haste in assembling the necessary equipment for the ceremonies."

He delivered 12 important messages within the American sector at Verdun, France. On his last mission, ""Cher Ami,"" shot through the breast by enemy fire, managed to return to his loft. A message capsule was found dangling from the ligaments of one of his legs that also had been shattered by enemy fire. The message he carried was from Major Whittlesey's ""Lost Battalion"" of the 77th Infantry Division that had been isolated from other American forces. Just a few hours after the message was received, 194 survivors of the battalion were safe behind American lines.  ""Cher Ami"" was awarded the French ""Croix de Guerre"" with Palm for his heroic service between the forts of Verdun. He died in 1919 as a result of his battle wounds. ""Cher Ami"" was later inducted into the Racing Pigeon Hall of Fame in 1931 and received a gold medal from the Organized Bodies of American Racing Pigeon Fanciers in recognition of his extraordinary service during World War I.

ArtefactPorn,3cyfg8,New_new_account2,3,Sat Jul 11 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"Description from the Smithsonian:  Peter Hill (1767-1820) is one of the few African American professional clockmakers known to have worked in antebellum America. A freed slave, he had a shop first in Burlington Township and then in Mount Holly, New Jersey--two small, predominantly Quaker communities near Philadelphia.  Undoubtedly the Quaker commitment to educating and freeing slaves benefited Hill. While still a slave, he served a traditional apprenticeship with his master, Joseph Hollingshead, Jr., a clockmaker whose brother John and father Joseph, Sr., practiced the trade as well. Hill gained his freedom in 1795. He married, set up a workshop of his own, and purchased land in Burlington. He also may have continued to work for either or both of the Hollingshead brothers for a time. Hill never became rich, but his status as a skilled freedman in a Quaker community permitted him to live comfortably and work independently.  Only a few clocks by Hill are known to survive. The movement of the Smithsonian example, which dates from about 1800, closely resembles English clocks of the period. The painted dial, marked ""No. 30/ Peter Hill/ Burlington,"" is an English import. The clock's walnut case is attributed to the cabinetmaker George Deacon, whose shop was only a few doors from Hill's own home and workshop in Burlington.

ArtefactPorn,3ctg4v,alas11,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"Beef? Sure, common people ate pork and chicken ... and cheese. And they kept dairy cows and they butchered calves for rennet to make cheese. This leather looks thin enough to be calfskin. (This is a reformation-era piece of clothing, an age where even the low farmhand experienced an increase in wealth.)   A chicken cost the equivalent to about £500 in today's money. Chickens certainly weren't the popular, and extremely cheap food they are today. Most common people had very little money for any kind of meat in their daily diet. Many people lived on a nobleman's land, where they rented their lodgings. The houses didn't have windows, there were no candles to light the room, and they almost certainly shared their house with the animals which didn't belong to them. they couldn't just go and butcher a cow when they felt like it. If the crops failed, there was a famine. Meat was not rare, but was expensive enough to be a treat.   No, we're not. The patterning and cutting is skilled work, a seamstress was not a highly paid skilled laborer. A tailor probably spent 10 minutes drawing chalklines on a few pieces of leather, then an apprentice or hired hand did the cutting and sewing, a child or cripple or someone with a broken leg may have done the perforations   Tanning was a skilled (but unpopular) profession. Leather was pretty popular in men's dress at this time, but the common man would have worn something very simple.  Source: I like medieval and elizabethan history.

While there is so little data about the poor during those times there are some things that seem pretty undisputed.   edit: I hit enter too soon!

ArtefactPorn,3ctg4v,NoSleepTillWhiterun,9,Fri Jul 10 22:09:30 2015 UTC,"Traditional leather is very cheap to produce. Vegetable tanning has been around for at least 5000 years and was a commonly used and widely practiced technique by 1500 though examples of leather from that time period were very lightly tanned by the standards of today.   Soak the hide in lye to remove the hair. Easily made with some hardwood ash and water. Wash blue hide thoroughly in water. Scrape hair and meaty bits from the hide. Transfer to a pot of tea made from oak bark, galls and other vegetation high in tannins. Stretch and allow to dry. Condition with dubbin or some other fat liquor. Beat to soften.  If it walks, swims, slithers or flies and has skin it can be made into leather. Anyone who farmed had animals that might get eaten or would eventually die of old age. Anyone who hunted had more hides then they could use. Skins were plentiful and cheap.  Stitching doesn't take long on thin leather. That looks quite fine and the tooling would take a  little while but a skilled leather worker could make something like that in a day if the pattern was well known and they were skilled, which are both evident from this image."

Leather can be as hard as a rock if treated in certain ways but you should remember that the air pressure inside is holding the rubber or leather rigid. It's actually much softer if deflated.

The seams are reinforced with perforated leather ""tape"", similarly the buttoned edges have revers facings. All the other edges are nicely turned. There appears to be a tailoring seam running up from the waistband to the front of the arm hole, this allows the belly-to-chest flare to fit closer. And I truly love the sleeve treatment, the nice little half-sleeves coned in to fit at the arm opening. And about those perforations. They are far too precisely spaced to have been made casually by incidental labor.

The John Woodman Higgins Collection  2014.89  Late sixteenth-century warlords and powerful generals wore flamboyant “extraordinary helmets” (kawari-kabuto) to distinguish themselves amidst uniformly armored footmen and brilliantly attired samurai. This masterpiece of metalwork must have belonged to one of the most important men in Japan at the time of the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. It was so greatly admired that several derivative copies were made during the 1600s.  The helmet is sculpted like a sea-conch shell with a brim textured like ray-skin. The conch-shell is a symbol of worldly and religious authority. It was sounded by generals to marshal troops. It was also a symbol of Buddha’s voice and the preaching of Buddhist Law.

The sphere represents the ""universal machine"" of the world according to the concepts developed by Aristotle and perfected by Ptolemy. The terrestrial globe is placed at the center. Surprisingly, it even displays territories that were still relatively little known at the time.  Restored in the nineteenth century by Ferdinando Meucci, the device is now incomplete and some of its parts are mismatched. The wooden parts of the sphere are elaborately painted and covered with fine gold leaf. The sphere rests on a stand with four sirens, heavily restored in the nineteenth century.  This model is similar to a smaller one built by Santucci in 1582 for King Philip II of Spain, now in the Escorial library. Provenance: Medici collections."

ArtefactPorn,3cfl1g,herefromthere,6,Tue Jul 7 16:35:41 2015 UTC,I would have called them ear spools because that's what we call them in Mesoamerica. I figured maybe Japan bad different terminology like flint vs. chert
ArtefactPorn,3cfl1g,BcookieOmonsterB,3,Tue Jul 7 17:48:55 2015 UTC,Flint is just high quality chert but all chert isn't flint. Flint is usually reserved for the higher quality chert from chalk/limestone deposits.
ArtefactPorn,3cfl1g,BcookieOmonsterB,5,Tue Jul 7 19:24:10 2015 UTC,Yes and no. People have incorrectly applied the term flint to chert deposits from outside of the original high quality sources in England.
ArtefactPorn,3cfl1g,StabbyDMcStabberson,3,Tue Jul 7 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"Flint is a hard, sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz, categorized as a variety of chert. It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks, such as chalks and limestones.  From a petrological point of view, ""flint"" refers specifically to the form of chert which occurs in chalk or marly limestone. Similarly, ""common chert"" (sometimes referred to simply as ""chert"") occurs in limestone.   It has nothing to do with country of origin, just composition, quality and uniformity."

ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,TheWetWestCoast,13,Mon Jul 6 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but I could see the spike being useful when someone else tries to grab the handle: You would pull the axe towards you and the spike would stab their hand, forcing them to let go."
ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,deadhour,-8,Mon Jul 6 19:36:42 2015 UTC,Who tries to grab the blade of an axe when there's a perfectly good handle?
ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,naraic42,9,Mon Jul 6 20:10:38 2015 UTC,They would grab the handle and since their hand would be higher up the handle than the users hand pulling the axe toward the user would cause the grabber to get their hand impaled.
ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,Maleval,11,Mon Jul 6 20:15:20 2015 UTC,The axe looks ceremonial.  Usually the spike on the back would act as an extra offensive mechanism but since it is rather small I would say it is purely decorative.
ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,SaracenS,10,Mon Jul 6 18:46:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't so quickly discount the extent to which weapons ornate as this were actually used.  That blade has some evidence of being repaired and edged. Like it may have been damaged in combat or training.

ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,superfahd,2,Tue Jul 7 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"It is ceremonial, but it's based on a military form, call the ""nachakh,"" from the Gurani-Kurdish ""nijak,"" meaning axe. It's a slashing weapon, distinguished from the ""latt,"" a roughly contemporaneous form which had a smaller, wedge-shaped blade that concentrated force in a smaller area. (Think tomahawk.)  As for its ceremonial nature, ask yourself which is the strongest part of the blade v. which part of the blade delivers the most force. If you were to swing this axe and meet any kind of serious resistance, you'd crack the blade right down the center.   It is a beautiful weapon, akin to the Sword of Osman. Gorgeous to look at, but not something you'd want to swing into chainmail."

ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,fpak1,14,Mon Jul 6 21:01:10 2015 UTC,It literally means property of the king. The Mamluks were a warrior slave caste in medieval Egypt who eventually were incorporated into a number of Islamic military forces as elite troops.
ArtefactPorn,3cbpxr,faceintheblue,17,Mon Jul 6 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"They were more than that.   Families sold their children into Mamluk slavery in the hope of giving them a brighter future. These slaves were trained and educated by their masters, who granted them their freedom upon coming of age. The more vassals one had, the more pull one had with the government. Only former slaves were allowed to hold positions of office and be a part of the military. Those born of freed slaves became carpenters, bakers, etc.   They had a pretty different concept of slavery than we do today."

There were Afghan mamluks in India there were Iranian/Turk mamluks in Syria and the rest of the Arab world too, but from what I understand they werent communicating with each other hence why I asked the country of origin."

It's useful for lightly armoured cavalry, when they are riding in the same direction as you. Usually, you'd want a longer weapon on a horse, for hitting infantry or enemies going the opposite way to you, but that advantage is entirely unneeded when both are next to each other and going the same way.  Smaller weapons are useful to stop people throwing you off your horse, or grabbing your reigns"

I would imagine it would likely have been wood, sort of cross thatched, or some kind of grid pattern, or something like that. Something light, that would let light through, but provide shade, and that would help for rain as well. So, maybe sort of half tube boards so water runs out the sides of the building, rather than through the cracks, and only a little rain would get through.  Because otherwise, it looks like it would be really hard to light up very well, and fire lighting would not have been so awesome, imo.  It also appears to me, that a stone roof would be tough to build in that configuration, without a substantial support system in place."

ArtefactPorn,3cbij0,RufusSaltus,2,Tue Jul 7 04:33:39 2015 UTC,Usually these would be bound with leather cord.  The writing is done on wax that has been mixed with a black pigment (likely lamp black) and the letters were incised with a metal stylus.  These styluses usually had fan-like backs to erase with.

Do I see earrings? This must have been made by a skilled artist, or are detailed figures like these common from that culture?  Thanks for posting!"
ArtefactPorn,3c52qc,deadhour,2,Sun Jul 5 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"These figures are quite common and come in a variety of styles, possibly regional and temporal. Unfortunately, no one has done a systematic survey of archaeologically recovered figures to determine whether or not there is regional or temporal overlap. Nayarit appears to be the home of the Ixtlan del Rio and Lagunillas (formerly known as Chinesco) style. Colima is home to the Colima and Pihuamo style. The Colima style is also the style which commonly depict animal vessels such as the famous Colima dog effigies. And Jalisco is home to the El Arenal Brown, Ameca Grey, San Sebastian Red, and Zacatecas.  The one in this thread is a Lagunillas style  The other one I posted yesterday I believe is El Arenal Brown, I need to double check some sources Ameca-Etzatlan.  These two are Colima style.  No formal workshops have actually ever been found for any of the style of figures. We believe that they are household or community produced items. The figures may be portraits of people, living or deceased, or possibly even gods. Christopher Beekman gave a presentation last fall about how some of these figures may represent scenes from common mythologies and he compared a few dozen figures to scenes from the Codex Mendoza. They may have been used to tell a story seeing as how the shaft tomb cultures of West Mexico made no murals and painted no scenes on vessels.  While these figures are commonly associated with shaft tombs and mortuary goods, they may have had a life before their ""death"". Many of them show use-wear on the bottom indicating frequent moving and use. It may be that these figures merely ended up as a part of the mortuary goods of the dead.  Back in the 1970s Beekman had said an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 of these figures were looted from across West Mexico. The numbers have risen since then, but not by much. Most of the prime areas for looting have been tapped out."

Not sure if we should support this sort of thing or fight for the right to be laid in peace for eternity. On one side they are very long dead so they dont have feelings but on the other we are disrespecting what they and their family wanted. I imagine they would feel having their grave robbed even if thousands of years later would rob them of the possesions in the after life.
ArtefactPorn,3bvuyw,IrishBreakfast,38,Thu Jul 2 17:26:26 2015 UTC,"In a way, I can understand what you're getting at, but at the same time think of it this way: these artifacts (most likely) weren't dug up by some thoughtless graverobber and tossed around for jollies, they were carefully and respectfully excavated by passionate people in order to preserve history, more importantly the history of that long-deceased man. I personally find exhibition like this to be an honoring the dead of a different kind-- people are seeing these belongings and wondering about the life of the man who owned and wore them, wondering who he may have been, what his name was and what he stood for, and what his reality of life was ~1400 years ago. It inspires others to respect and understand history, rather than leave it buried and forgotten."

ArtefactPorn,3bvuyw,diito,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"That's exactly a thought I had as well! A great many ancient cultures placed a heavy emphasis on rebirth and/or eternal life through burial rites and ceremony, the whole idea of ""living on after death"" is why we get so many beautiful glimpses of the past through gravesites. Many people say that you only truly die when your name is said for the last time or when people stop thinking of you, so in a way respectful excavations and exhibitions like this bring these ancient people back to life in our imaginations. Probably not exactly what they pictured when they were laid to rest, but it's an eternal life nonetheless."
ArtefactPorn,3bvuyw,rokuk,13,Sat Jul 4 13:49:47 2015 UTC,I don't think people realize how small the human family really is.  This guy is probably either one of my direct ancient ancestors or in some way or somehow related to one. The German side of my family came from the immediate area he was found and 1500 years is certainly a long enough time for that connection to happen somewhere.  Chances are pretty good the same goes for nearly everyone else with family from that part or Europe...  Even if I knew 100% this was my 20x great grandparent I'd support this.

This bowl was cast using batches of different colored glass to create four roughly equal sections in translucent purple, yellow, blue, and colorless glass.

Few vessels made of large sections or bands of differently colored glass are known from antiquity, and this example is the only one that combines the technique with fused-on decoration.

ArtefactPorn,3bnw5b,reactionarytale,6,Tue Jun 30 22:22:21 2015 UTC,That crest above the gate... Is that really from the original masonry? It looks like a much later European addition to me.
ArtefactPorn,3bnw5b,d_zed,5,Wed Jul 1 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"No, that has to be at least from the late medieval period. That's about when coats of arms became that complex. Heraldry as a whole only started out about 900 years ago.  As a sidenote, and in no way intending to be mean, a crest is an element of a Coat of Arms that sits on top of a helmet, or in this case the crown. This specific CoA doesn't seem to have a crest.  EDIT: After a bit of googling turns out that these spicific arms were sculpted over the gate in 1781."

When my great aunt died, we asked the provincial museum if they wanted any of the crap in her basement and they fell over themselves coming to get it. Old washing machines, scrub boards and just nick nacks collected over a 94 year life.    For many historians the really interesting parts aren't the big news of the events of the day.

It's also great in museums because it makes history more ""real"" and relatable for most people. However, it really depends on the context and time. For example, 1936 Germany is very well documented with personal stories and memorabilia. While I'm sure that you might find some Museum interested in this, calling the average life of 1936 Germany a ""mystery"" seems like a stretch."

The ""kreistag der haupstadt der bewegung"" (County council of the capital of the movement) part is in reference to this found here (link in German; I used ""translate page"" in Chrome to read it)  >District council of the Nazi Party  >In Munich, the district council of the Nazi Party was held to 11 October 1936 by 6. Under the motto ""Germany needs men of resolute hardness"" he wanted the participants ""to a new year of work for the movement and in the movement"" einschwören. The conclusion of the meeting formed a rally on the ""Royal Square"", which was attended by 48,000 people  Basically a Nazi pep-rally. I would assume that these medals were handed out either at the rally en masse, or given only to people who helped organize or execute the event, maybe to just higher-ups in the NSDAP who attended, or perhaps awarded in some manner based on merit.  I'll keep looking for more info.  edit: found this here (also in German, translated page by Chrome)   For actual prestige of the district Munich-Upper Bavaria but were also introduced in 1936 ""Kreistage"" that should contribute as ""commitment day"" to strengthen the link between party leadership, party rank and people. The initiated by the district leadership for all circles of Gauterritoriums authentic and centrally designed, coordinated and organized party productions were as annually recurring multiday major events with regional reference as it Reichsparteitage miniature and targeted in their content design and the variety of forms of their individual events on a total acquisition and penetration of the living world the inhabitants of the ""Traditionsgaues"". Thus trying those responsible in the Munich party headquarters ultimately nothing more than the director of the entire public and private life of their ""territory"" to usurp and shape under bundling of all forces at work here an active and ready to use ""national community""."

The sacrificial victim was bound spread-eagled to a wooden frame, he was then shot with many arrows so that his blood spilled onto the ground. The spilling of the victim's blood to the ground was symbolic of the desired abundant rainfall, with a hopeful result of plentiful crops. After the victim was shot with the arrows, the heart was removed with a stone knife. The flayer then made a laceration from the lower head to the heels and removed the skin in one piece. These ceremonies went on for twenty days, meanwhile the votaries of the god wore the skins.   Wikipedia telling it like it is, but who knows how it feels to party in a dead man's rotting flesh peel."

I mean, it is different, when you'll regularly eat human meat at a ceremony for the good of society.  Of course it's a complex issue, but there is something fascinating about the very explicit and official nature of the meaning of torture, blood, brutality.  Christianity uses a torture device as its symbol and believers wear that thing around their necks and place it on top of buildings, but let's be honest: the symbolism is a bit different."
ArtefactPorn,3bcu2g,gaspard_winckler,2,Sun Jun 28 16:35:43 2015 UTC,I agree that the symbolism is extremely different and the acts themselves were extremely different. I'm just saying the idea of symbolic ritual leading to supernatural environmental response is the same.

I don't think it has ever been widely held among, historians that human meat was a part of anything resembling a stable diet. I only mentioned it as part of ceremonial rites and there is little doubt that this did happen. Codices, reports and cut marks in bones support this theory to the point of verifying it completely. Besides, it corresponds well with the practice of human sacrifice.  I don't mean to say that they were savages or a primitive culture in any way. Quite the contrary which just makes it the more interesting. I'm just saying that there is part of this civilization that does carry elements of death cult practices and that is indeed interesting."

In the 14th century Gotland was being invaded by the danish. The nobles of the city promised the farmers of the island that they would have refuge inside the city walls.   But when the danish army came they never opened the city gates, they just used the farmers as cannon fodder. Ordering their archers to fire straight into the battle that ensued, killing Gutar and Danes alike.  700 years later the farmers of Gotland still hold a grudge against the people of Visby, but who can blame them, it's a really shitty move to pull."

Anyone can blame them and for good reason. The farmers of Gotland today aren't the farmers who were kept out of the city to be killed, and the people of Visby today aren't the ones who locked the farmers out.  It's like being mad at modern Italians for what the Romans did.  What almost certainly happened was the gates were open when the Danish army arrived, and plenty of people who were outside did get in. What would you do if you commanded the garrison? Just leave the gates open as an army begins their attack? No, you'd close them even if there are people trying to get in."

The farmers outside were paying more tax than the people in the city, but it's not like the city folk hated the farmers, so why would they lock them out as soon as they got word of an approaching army?  In fact there's even reason to believe people came out of the city to fight. It's hard to be sure because all the bodies look the same. A large amount of armour found on bodies is really crude though, which suggests it was made in a real rush. Not something you'd expect from an invading army of professional soldiers, but from a town under siege. How did it get there? Quite possibly from men who came out to fight."

ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,Jagaerkatt,3,Sat Jun 27 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, he ded."
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,qtx,3,Fri Jun 26 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"If anyone is curious about the battle, there is a documentary on youtube that covers the event and casualties.   Apparently the peasants were so ill equiped in older style weapons and arms that they were just buried with most of their equipment. But most interesting of all was the shear number of leg wounds inflicted upon the peasant militia. There is a theory that the Danes exploited the peasants lack of leg armor and cut them down to the ground before dispatching them. Maybe that is why this skull has three crossbow bolts protruding from his skull? Being dispatched by crossbowmen while laid out upon the ground without the need of a mace to the skull? Also If there were crossbowmen shooting down into the melee while on the wall, that could explain why this guy has bolts lodged in the back of his skull. Lying dead face down."
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,wonderboy2402,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. How exactly did they exploit the lack of leg armour? By shooting arrows at leg height until everyone went down?  Also, given that the peasants were obviously screwed over by the nobles and had no reason to protect them, why not throw down their weapons and pledge allegiance to the invading Danes? Nothing to lose it seems."
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,LoneStarGeneral,3,Sat Jun 27 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"Well they explain how in that documentary. Basically, it is thought that the green milita were armed with spears and hastily assembled armor while the professional battle hardened mercenary army of Danes where in modern / transitional plate armor and with swords. They basically could seize the shaft of the spears while directing sword blows down at shins and feet. Once you are lying screaming on the ground on your back you could be dispatched easily. I wonder if as the slaughter advanced those in the rank were finishing off the prone fallen. The number of leg injuries seems unusual (one skeleton shown had literally more then a dozen cuts on his shins) and that is probably why it got suggested. Also of odd note was the discovery that the milita lacked helmets. Whether looted after the battle or they actually fought in chainmail coifs seems still be a debate.  The milita had already had one battle before this one and lost soundly.  There were even numerous severed feet discovered. Apparently one body had both feet severed off from one blow. But hard to say if this wasn't immediately after death or as punishment for challenging the danes.  I dont know all the history on why they did not surrender. Or even if anyone from within the town assisted the Milita peasants. But basically it boiled down to the rich merchants in town demanding taxes and trade tarrifs from the peasants to trade within their walls (the town was a major trade hub of the region). It is thought that by shuttering the town to the desperate peasants they could be rid of the uprising of sort and perhaps strike a deal with the Danes. Apparently the town paid a hefty rasom not be sacked but still had their chruches and monasteries looted.   Anyway most of this is in the documentary, it is worth watching."

(nsfw, human remains)  Also there were only 25 intact coats of plate in the grave, with fragmentary sections from more.   So the ""lucky"" Gotlanders had some armor, but nothing even close to full coverage."
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,magichocolateunicorn,2,Sat Jun 27 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"Surprising how low the penetration is on those arrows(?).  I always thought it was possible to shoot someone fully through the head, like feathers on one side and arrowhead protruding the other side. Or did medieval nordic bows just suck? I assume he wasn't wearing a helmet or that would be 'stapled' to his head still?"
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,ethanGeltan,4,Fri Jun 26 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"Depends how far away the shooter was. The further away, the less energy the arrow has to penetrate."
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,Dr_Bukkakee,3,Fri Jun 26 20:20:23 2015 UTC,Three times makes me think something like a execution or target practice.
ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,wonderboy2402,4,Fri Jun 26 23:59:49 2015 UTC,Yeah it was a bit of overkill and I don't see them wasting bolts on a person who is already dead. I bet he was just on a spot on the battlefield where a bunch of archers were shooting and a some landed in his head after he was dead. And I'm pretty sure their executions involved blades and blunt objects rather then bolts to the head.

ArtefactPorn,3b7ojy,ethanGeltan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Further will always have less energy. You are losing energy to air drag no matter how you shoot. Even if shooting straight up, the projectile will lose a substantial amount of energy relative to that at which it left the barrel/bow. Of course the larger the mass and less the area/drag coefficient, the more energy is conserved."

ArtefactPorn,3b4y57,CougarForLife,16,Fri Jun 26 11:48:51 2015 UTC,Iconoclasm. It's not limited to any religion.
ArtefactPorn,3b4y57,BleuBrink,-3,Fri Jun 26 12:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is limited to certain religions. Iconoclasm is unthinkable in religions such as the Ancient Egyptian, the Ancient Arabian, and other pre-Christian faiths."
ArtefactPorn,3b4y57,barnaclejuice,5,Fri Jun 26 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenism   Akhenaten staged the ritual regicide of the old supreme god Amun, and ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt, and of all the old gods. The word for `gods' (plural) was proscribed, and inscriptions have been found in which even the hieroglyph of the word for ""mother"" has been excised and re-written in alphabetic signs, because it had the same sound in ancient Egyptian as the sound of name of the Theban goddess Mut. Aten's name is also written differently after Year 9, to emphasise the radicalism of the new regime. No longer is the Aten written using the symbol of a rayed solar disc, but instead it is spelled phonetically.  With Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded almost immediately fell out of favor due to pressures from the Priesthood of Amun. Tutankhaten, who succeeded him at age 8 (with Akhenaten's old vizier, Ay, as regent) changed his name to Tutankhamun in year 3 of his reign (1348 BC or 1331 BC) and abandoned Akhetaten, the city falling into ruin. Temples Akhenaten had built, including the temple at Thebes, were disassembled, reused as a source of building materials and decorations for their own temples, and inscriptions to Aten defaced."
ArtefactPorn,3b4y57,BleuBrink,2,Fri Jun 26 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Common misconception about Atenism. Sure, the cult of Amun has been targeted, but not that of any other deities throughout Egypt during all of the Amarna Period. The manner in which the Amun cult was compromised is far more similar to damnatio memoriae, which was a practice very usual in Egypt. What they did was similar to what had been done with Hatshepsut.  Iconoclasm has a very different meaning. It is the targeting of idols and icons. That never happened in Egypt before Christianity. Icons of other gods other than Amun were tolerated, to say the very least. For instance, even in Tell el-Amarna statues of house deities such as Bes were found. And not just that: even the officially adopted deity Aton had representations of him being made. The king, still seen as divine and straight up called nTr (god) in texts, hymns and correspondence, still had statues of him being made and consecrated. And again, the multitude of temples centered around cultic images of a plethora of deities carried on normally throughout Egypt. Funded by the state, and carried out in the name of the king, too.  Atenism has nothing to do with iconoclasm. I have never heard anything of the sort in all my time in egyptological institutes, and doubt I ever will, because it's that much of a preposterous idea, considering the basic theology of ancient Egyptian religion, which remained unchanged in the Amarna period."

Excavations carried out in 1991 showed that the mound had been raised as a series of level terraces with retaining walls made of nearly intact amphorae filled with shards to anchor them in place. Empty amphorae were probably carried up the mound intact on the backs of donkeys or mules and then broken up on the spot, with the shards laid out in a stable pattern. Lime appears to have been sprinkled over the broken pots to neutralise the smell of rancid oil.[1]  As the oldest parts of Monte Testaccio are at the bottom of the mound, it is difficult to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC."

It has been estimated that the hill contains the remains of as many as 53 million olive oil amphorae, in which some 6 billion litres (1.3 billion imperial gallons/1.6 billion U.S. gallons) of oil were imported. Studies of the hill's composition suggest that Rome's imports of olive oil reached a peak towards the end of the 2nd century AD, when as many as 130,000 amphorae were being deposited on the site each year."

Part of learning about energetics is learning how long it took people to do things in the past through replicative experiments. One of the experiments I read was on stone working in the Maya region for use in making decorative as well as glyphic items at the site of Copan. The material used extensively at Copan is called tuff, which is consolidated volcanic ash. It's soft when first quarried, but hardens over time. The researcher employed skilled stonemasons to carve replicas of the items found at Copan with both modern and stone tools. Even with stone tools the amount of labor that was added to working the tuff was small. A detailed decorative item made out of tuff only took a few hours to do not including the time it took to quarry the stone."

Because large-format manuscripts often contain the Word of God, it is very possible that some bookmakers wished to reflect the importance of the text with a suitably impressive material format. Alternatively, some have suggested that these books were meant to reflect the power and prestige of the donors who paid for their commission — a wealthy bishop or nobleman perhaps, who wished to memorialize his name in the production of a massive and showy pandect.  Others have provided more pragmatic reasoning, suggesting that these books were designed big in order to rest on a lectern for public reading — their large size making it easier for readers in a church to see the page. Indeed, the collective reading of large-format books stationed on lecterns has been recorded in a number of medieval illuminations and paintings.  Giant medieval manuscripts"

The British Library has published advice on the use of white gloves. Essentially, we recommend that it is preferable to handle manuscripts with clean dry hands.

Basically, handling a manuscript only with gloves will eventually result in drier pages, which makes them brittle and more likely to crumble upon handling."
ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,offguard,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Cenodoxus's comment is pretty on the nose; vellum is skin and in touching it the oils on a person's skin help keep it  from drying out. One French manuscript library I visited required hand washing before entering the reading room, but that is an excessive example. The only time I have worn gloves is when it is required, usually in American libraries or university collections that don't know what to do with their material.   In well-used medieval manuscripts, its not uncommon to find a darkened smudge in the area on the right side of the page where your thumb might go to rest or flip the page."

ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,pvsa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:59:18 2015 UTC,Just like a strop for a straight razor. Needs some oils and some handling to keep things healthy.
ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,Sleuther,2,Sun Jun 21 23:38:18 2015 UTC,That actually makes a lot of sense. I've seen them used in some documentaries and not in others so I wasn't sure.   edit: What about latex or something similar?
ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,Sleuther,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"I've always heard this but always wondered, is there any kind of documented science behind this? I would assume they have some, but the concept just seems too flimsy to be true.   If the oil on your skin is moisturising the pages, wouldn't it be beneficial to apply something similar to the entirety of the manuscript, rather than just where a hand would/should be touching it?  Furthermore, the ""white gloves"" in the link you supplied do not look like gloves that have been properly chosen for the job at hand, they look clothey, thick and cumbersome. There are plenty of variations of gloves, which are disposed of with each use, that use a variety of materials and have varying textures.  I'm not saying it's wrong, there just hasn't been a really convincing argument laid out for me."
ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,yurigoul,2,Mon Jun 22 07:49:18 2015 UTC,"Quoting from International Preservation News, December 2005 :  In addition to accumulating dirt on the outer surface of the glove, warmth resulting from insulating the hand stimulates eccrine sweat gland production. The glove’s raw fiber, cotton, contains fats and alkanes, making it less than ideal as a prophylactic.  Sweat itself is a slightly acidic liquid composed almost exclusively of water (99.0-99.5%). The remaining solutes are nearly evenly divided between inorganic salts and organic substances. Sebaceous glands (secreting sebum, skin oil) do not exist on the palms of the hands, so the direct transfer of sebum through normal collection handling is not a significant issue.  Given the widespread belief that routine handling of paper with bare hands chemically damages it, it is telling that our research uncovered no scientific evidence supporting this notion. “Fingerprints on Photographs” states that a fingerprint could damage a silver image if the salts in sweat (particularly sodium chloride) managed to penetrate through the gelatin layer. Since the surface of paper is almost always protected by a layer of gelatin, sodium chloride would have to permeate this barrier before it could interact with the cellulose beneath.  Even if cotton gloves were capable of providing an effective prophylactic barrier between patrons and the collection, their use promotes the false illusion that the hands, once encased, are somehow transformed into ‘safe’ instruments. Wearing gloves actually increases the potential for physically damaging fragile material through mishandling, and this is especially true for ultra thin or brittle papers that become far more difficult to handle with the sense of touch dulled.

ArtefactPorn,3amf1z,pvsa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:42:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That answered a lot of questions. However, it still leaves me curious about the use of latex, nitrile, and vinyl gloves... But if the chemicals of the human hand are a non-issue, I suppose, it doesn't quite matter. That concept is hard to overcome, coming from a person who lives in a world where human secretions are basically the bane of every collectible, artifact, or seemingly historic piece of work, but I suppose that is the nature of the more organic materials of the past."

ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,exsimile,82,Sat Jun 20 12:42:16 2015 UTC,"The portrait comes from the Fayum oasis, a wealthy district on the left bank of the Nile about 65 miles south of Cairo. Part of a thousand images dating from around the time of Christ until 300 AD or later, these pictures are known as “Fayum paintings,” or sometimes “Fayum mummy portraits,”, for most of them were recovered wrapped up in the burial linens of ancient mummies, placed in the spot where the face would once have been. They are the oldest painted portraits to have survived from anywhere in the world.  The paintings are the products of a multicultural society, one in which Romans mixed with native Egyptians and with Greeks descended from the Macedonian armies of Alexander the Great to create a polyglot community. They combine the religious imagery of Rome and Egypt, and production of them seems to have ceased shortly before the final Christianisation of the Roman Empire.  The portraits found in Philadelphia were typically executed in tempera, using egg whites to produce a finish resembling watercolour. Those from Arsinoe are  painted in encaustic – a technique that involves mixing pigments with soft wax, applying it to slivers of sycamore tree or lime, and sealing the image with heat to produce results that resemble oil paintings.

ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Sat Jun 20 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"I've recently taken it upon myself to read through books by ancient Romans, and honestly I think you are correct.  I've begun to believe that most of the great people of the Renaissance were nothing better than translators of older ideas.  And it's not even art. It's science too. And architecture, engineering, and so many other ideas. The site I use is currently down unfortunately, so I'm paraphrasing, but in either book I or II of Marcus Varro's ""On Agriculture"" he writes something along the lines of:   And when building near swamps, take care to build away from the winds coming from them, for there exists tiny animals too small to see with the eyes, which enter through the nose and mouth, and cause diseases in the lungs.   I read that and was like WTF man. Last time I checked, you're about 1800 years early for a mircoscope. How do you know this?"
ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,SDStormtrooper,3,Sat Jun 20 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"How do you know this?   He did not, just like ancient philosophers like Democritos he had no idea and was just making up reasons as to why people got sick near swamp or in Democritos' case what things are made of. Also you are giving renaissance artists and polymaths way too little credit."
ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,SpinningHead,3,Sun Jun 21 08:42:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Man seems to have a rather good technical grasp on how diseases spread and what from.  Also, I know I'm shortening the stick of great people. I'm sorry. They had their moments of ingenuity. But more often it seems to be just putting together existing technology and ideas, rather than making new ones. For example, the Romans had steam engines and rails. They never put 1+1 together to make automatic carriages. Others in the Renaissance did.  This was the value of the Renaissance. Not the ideas. Those existed for eons. It was how to apply ideas."
ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,TheLeviathong,3,Sun Jun 21 12:25:13 2015 UTC,"I've begun to believe that most of the great people of the Renaissance were nothing better than translators of older ideas.   They would have actually agreed with you. The whole thing was kicked off by an increase in access to classical works, many of which were completely lost to the West (but available in Arabic translations in the near East) for a few centuries. All the renaissance greats were doing was trying to rediscover, equal, and, if they were lucky, do better than their classical predecessors. You know how classical music strictly speaking is only one period of what is colloquially called classical music? Well the visual arts of that period are actually called neo-classical, as in a revival of the classical (ancient Greek and Roman) styles. The music is only called classical because, since recording equipment didn't exist and nobody knew how to read what primitive sheet music had survived, there were no actual examples of classical music to build on."
ArtefactPorn,3ai7xc,SpinningHead,3,Sun Jun 21 09:30:51 2015 UTC,"lol funny thing is, now that we've begun understanding how to read classical sheet must, it sounds closer to rock and guitar music of the contemporary age.

It was based off water pressure instead of electricity, but holy shit. They actually didn't invent it. They inherited the infrastructure from the Greeks, who invented to (ironically), rapidly communicate Roman invasion in Sicily.  Something I want to research eventually, is if the Romans ever duplicated the technology along aqueducts. I've honestly been quite curious of a number of features that seem to be built for more than just free-flow water to a destination. I really really really want to investigate if they were also using aqueducts as ""power lines"" for such devices."

The center piece of the tomb is a bronze cauldron decorated with Acheloos, the Greek god of rivers.  The end of the 6th century B.C. is marked by the economic development of Etruscan and Greek city states. Looking for slaves, metal, and amber, Mediterranean merchants start trading with the continental Celtic communities, who themselves trade along rivers like the Loire/Seine/Saône/Rhine/Danube. Through this trade, the Celtic elites acquire prestige goods that we now find in monumental tombs.  Original article (in french)"

The cauldron is identified as being from greek or etruscan origin and in those cultures Acheloos is typically represented with a horned human face, so its a traditional identification for such a design.   Acheloos is not a very well known god so one cannot be sure there isn't for example another etruscan god that has been amalgamated with him (IDK why but etruscans love the guy).

When he battled Heracles over the river nymph Deianeira, Achelous turned himself into a bull.   Heracles tore off one of his horns and forced the god to surrender. Achelous had to trade the goat horn of Amalthea to get it back.

ArtefactPorn,3a6jfm,Damnitgigi,78,Thu Jun 18 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"The Thirty Years' War in Europe ended with the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which upheld the principle of cuius regio eius religio , i.e. the faith professed by the ruler was obligatory for his subjects. At that time Silesia was part of the Catholic Habsburg monarchy. In most of the province Protestants were persecuted and deprived of the right and possibility to practise their faith.  Through the agency of the Lutheran king of Sweden, the emperor finally allowed (1651-52) the erection of three churches, henceforth known as the Churches of Peace. The Emperor's consent was, however, given upon conditions that were difficult to comply with. The churches had to be built exclusively of perishable materials (wood and clay), located outside city walls, and built in a limited period of time. These restrictions, together with the need to provide adequate space for large crowds of worshippers, forced the architect, Albrecht von Sabisch (1610-88), a prominent master-builder and fortification designer active in Wroclaw, to implement pioneering constructional and architectural solutions of a scale and complexity unknown ever before or since in wooden architecture."

Nails are handy when you're doing framing, but a well-made piece of furniture is usually built with mortise and tenons, pins, dovetails, rabbet joints, and quite a few other techniques.  If you or anyone is curious about traditional woodworking, a copy of Tage Frid Teaches Woodworking explains everything.  The book even goes into detail about how to do the work with either hand or power tools.  Also, the lack of nails most likely contributed to the longetivity of this building.  Traditional woodworking almost always holds up better than using nails and screws."

ArtefactPorn,3a370h,Lazy_Scheherazade,6,Wed Jun 17 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"This piece is a classic black on white style III piece.  Black on white vessels are usually geometric in design, the use of figures is quite a bit rarer, I only have one in the collection I am working on.  To be honest, some of the geometric designs are more impressive to me than those with figures.  Some of these pieces contain a beautiful complexity with patterns based on line width, sectioning of the vessel, repetition ect.  This piece still retains the early affinity for creating patterns based on quadrants.  These vessels are made of clay from very near the site it was produced with little modifications because the clays already contain plenty of sand.  The vessels are white washed and decorated with black iron containing compounds.  Usually only the inside of the bowl was decorated.  Vessels come in all shapes and types but usually remain consistent in size.  The Mimbres-Mogollon culture used a variety of ceramic styles, black on white being less common than plain and corrugated types..  This piece is probably from a grave, the reason is the deliberate damage done to make it suitable for the purpose. The early black on white was predominantly geometric in design and can be divided into numerous variations in pattern and line characteristics. My research is in locating the general origin of pieces based on material composition and stylistic variation.  The collection I am working with was collected from numerous sites which have since been forgotten or confused.

ArtefactPorn,3a1hdi,Mictlantecuhtli,22,Tue Jun 16 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"Mesa Alta consists of circular temple groups known as a guachimonton. The site is located in the Tequila valleys region of Jalisco, Mexico. It is one of many guachimontones that dot the landscape attributed to the Teuchitlan culture. The principal site of the Teuchitlan culture is Los Guachimontones where we get the name for these unique structures. A guachimonton is characterized by having a round central altar, a round patio space, and a raised banquette in which quadrangular platforms face inward. As you can see, the farmer who owns this land has planted agave in the patio space emphasizing the altar and patio areas. Along the edge one can note the change in agave rows and the small mounds that mark the platforms on the banquette. It is believed that each platform of a guachimonton is associated with a family/clan group that shares power within a corporate system. Rather than a single ruler the Teuchitlan culture had a council or rulers.   The second image is pulled from Google Earth. You can easily spot the ringed agave field from the picture above. To the left of it, however, is another guachimonton. You can see the faint outlines of the platforms that ring its patio and altar. Branching off of this second guachimonton is a ballcourt orientated to the south. It was not uncommon for ballcourts to use one of the platforms from a guachimonton as a cancha (or end platform) and may be tied to the prestige of the family/clan group whose platform was used.  This picture is a drawing of an idealized guachimonton based off of the Los Guachimontones site to give you a better idea of what a guachimonton looks like."

ArtefactPorn,3a1hdi,blackadder1132,6,Tue Jun 16 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. We have ceramic models from Nayarit which depict simplified guachimontones. They are definitely places of activity and worship. Some of them depict a pole ceremony which is not uncommon elsewhere in Mesoamerica. There are modern apologies among the Huichol and their tuki. Each ""house"" arranged in a circle around the altar contains a god, usually a figure or vessel of some sort. These gods lead active lives by participating in Huichol ceremonies. The hollow ceramic figures from this Late Formative era and area not only show use-wear which suggests frequently use, but they are also found in non-mortuary contexts. They may be family or clan ancestors or gods which were then used at a guachimonton for a ceremony. Based on a few excavations of various sized guachimontones we know that they are not built the same and have different associated material culture. This may indicate competing groups participating in construction and worship. This leads credence to the idea that they are a corporate society with shared rulership among several leaders rather than a single ruler."

ArtefactPorn,39yro2,ancientiger,5,Tue Jun 16 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, it probably began when a man decided to wear the skin of an animal head over his own. There are several ways this could have began. It could have been done in combat to intimidate one's enemy. It could have been done for protection from the elements, or it could have been done to distinguish early priests and shamans from ordinary folk. Likely a mix of all three when you take into account the man cultures who depicted human bodies with animal heads.   From there, these men could have been depicted in art with the actual head of the animal rather than the skin as a hat/helmet over his head. Once the concept of a human body with an animal head made its way into the mind of a single artist, creative liberties could then be taken."

ArtefactPorn,39st9q,worminthewoodwork,3,Sun Jun 14 14:03:51 2015 UTC,I counted twelve as well. Is the number of spokes significant in some way?
ArtefactPorn,39st9q,superkamiokande,3,Sun Jun 14 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious. Chariots vary across time as to how many spokes they use. Six was a popular number in the middle/late bronze age, I believe, for stability and weight reasons. But later European chariots seem to have a lot of spokes. Seems heavy to me."
ArtefactPorn,39st9q,worminthewoodwork,4,Sun Jun 14 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Heavy, maybe, but low spoke counts increase stress on the rim. So pounding around in a multi-horse chariot on hard surfaces may require more spokes to prevent the wheels breaking apart."
ArtefactPorn,39st9q,superkamiokande,2,Sun Jun 14 15:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my understanding is that six was the compromise between these factors favored by the Egyptians and Hittites. It retains structural integrity without being too heavy. I wonder why the Thracians opted for so many wheels?"

Although many of the American boats in the battle were damaged in the battle, Philadelphia was one of the few actually sunk that day.

ArtefactPorn,39rdgk,memento22mori,2,Sun Jun 14 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"While viewing the map I was wondering what a cenote is, so I looked it up. If anyone else is wondering, it's a natural pit or sinkhole where groundwater is exposed.       A cenote (English: /sɨˈnoʊtiː/ or /sɛˈnoʊteɪ/; Spanish: [seˈnote]; plural: cenotes; from Yucatec Maya dzonot or ts'onot,[1] ""well""[2]) is a natural pit, or sinkhole, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. The term derives from a word used by the low-land Yucatec Maya — ts'onot — to refer to any location with accessible groundwater. Cenotes are common geological forms in low latitude regions, particularly on islands, coastlines, and platforms with young post-Paleozoic limestones that have little soil development."

ArtefactPorn,39krau,bigmeat,77,Fri Jun 12 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"Small correction- this isn't a bath, it's a baptismal font. This would be used to baptize children and converts, hence all the religious imagery."

ArtefactPorn,39krau,asoap,15,Fri Jun 12 14:04:34 2015 UTC,Why do baptismal fonts remind me of jacuzzis?   Edit:  Not being funny.  It looks like there is seats for one to sit down and soak their feet in it.
ArtefactPorn,39krau,Droungarios,10,Fri Jun 12 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"Good question! The shape is very symbolic. It's designed with four corners to be reminiscent of the cross, and it actually has three steps/levels to bring to mind the Trinity. Adult candidates for baptism would descend the steps and kneel (or stand, this font looks quite deep in the center) in the water, while a clergy member pours water on their head, either from a higher step or from outside the font. I think the 'seats' effect is just a coincidence of these other design elements."
ArtefactPorn,39krau,asoap,3,Fri Jun 12 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"Huh.... that totally makes sense!  It also explains in the parent photo which has 8 points, but the use two different kinds of points.  One is square the other is round.  So it could be two crosses.  Or some other type of cross."
ArtefactPorn,39krau,Droungarios,3,Fri Jun 12 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"8 is also a symbolic number in of itself, and octagons are usually used to represent the union between the earthly (square) and the heavenly (circle). Many famous baptisteries follow an octagonal plan, or, as in the one above, indicate this union of earthly and divine in some way."

ArtefactPorn,39ibex,Tartlet,50,Thu Jun 11 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"As someone pointed out below the rock is actually a meteorite. Venerating meteorites as being otherworldly is quite ""common""... take, for example, the Black Stone of Mecca. The two meteorites (the Black Stone of Mecca and the Aphrodite rock) have actually been linked by scholars for centuries!  John of Damascus writing in the 730s A.D.---   “They [Muslims] call us associators (hetairiastas) because, they say, we introduce to God an associate by saying Christ is the Son of God and God. To them we say that the prophets and the scripture have transmitted this, and you, as you affirm, accept the prophets … Again we say to them: “How, when you say that Christ is the Word and Spirit of God, do you revile us as associators? For the Word and the Spirit are inseparable … So we call you mutilators (koptas) of God … They misrepresent us as idolaters because we prostrate ourselves before the cross, which they loathe. And we say to them: “Why then do you rub yourselves on a stone at your Ka’ba (Chabatha) and hail the stone with fond kisses?” … This, then, which they call “stone,” is the head of Aphrodite, whom they used to worship and whom they call Chabar.""   from: https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/writing-in-the-730s-a-d-kaaba-is-the-head-of-aphrodite-whom-they-muslims-worship-and-kiss/  Edit: for clarity- I'm not saying either stone is young, just that meteorites being associated with the other-worldly is more common than it seems. These aren't rocks, after all, but massive hunks of iron that fell from the sky with light trails and impacts that shake the earth. They're quite awe inspiring. ANYWAY: with the myth of Aphrodite being born of Uranus' castrated genitals being cast from above into the sea, you can see why a meteorite would be associated with her. :)"
ArtefactPorn,39ibex,Tartlet,14,Fri Jun 12 01:49:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Aphrodite stone is traced back to before 700 BC since Homer mentions it in the Odyssey."
ArtefactPorn,39ibex,akashik,14,Fri Jun 12 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, wait. I think I misunderstood what you ere saying- I know that the Aphrodite stone is older than 730s AD (obviously) but I was saying the link between the Black Stone of Mecca and the Aphrodite Aniconic (both meteorites) is an old and established link as well."

ArtefactPorn,39ibex,Misogynist-ist,9,Fri Jun 12 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"The meteorite of Aphrodite was meant to be touched- it is supposed to imbue love and fertility and all that. The stone itself is quite protected by millenia of built up residue. It has a thick shell of oils from secretions not only coming off people's hands, but also a variety of perfumes, resins, and other ""offerings"" applied to it. Yes, it sounds gross, but like the sacred filthy water of the Ganges river, the filth is part of the magic.  It looks a good deal cleaner than the stories I've heard depicting it as shiny jet black. Does anyone know if there has been a restoration effort to scrape it clean in the last 20 years?"
ArtefactPorn,39ibex,Subduction,-2,Fri Jun 12 03:59:33 2015 UTC,I didn't know this. But an exception does not prove the general rule untrue!

ArtefactPorn,39ibex,StraightTalkExpress,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:58:18 2015 UTC,"Edit: OK, guys. I get it. I've been corrected.   Have you ever gone to a cave where the stalactites or stalagmites looked weird and shiny? That's a result of the oils in your skin. One touch? Probably not going to do a ton of damage. But if many people do this, it actively damages the rock. I'm not a geologist and don't know how these oils affect every kind of rock or mineral, but it's also an issue of respect. For me, respect for history means I don't cheapen something by getting my body grease all over it. Touching something (without express permission- it's a little different when you're in the field, or if an expert has said it's okay to touch) is equivalent in my book to taking a wacky selfie with a mummy. It's not about the history, it's about proving to people you're out doing smart and sciency things.   Sorry for the rant. The last time I was at a major museum, I saw so much of this going on and got so angry I wrote an entire thesis about how a respect for the past and for archaeology needs to be cultivated in children when they're in grade school so they don't grow up to be douchebags dehumanizing history by using it as selfie fodder. Not in so many words- it was more about the theoretical basis of cross-curricular archaeology-based teaching and the implementation thereof, but a large portion of it was dedicated to ethical issues in the field. Finished it yesterday, actually! So bad museum behavior is a HUGE hot spot for me, like a dog that can't stop biting that itchy spot on its leg."

Stalactites and stalagmites are (usually) calcium carbonate. It's about a 3 on the mohs hardness scale, and does this when you throw some 10% HCL solution on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eCfx0Or8l.  It's also soluble in water.  The meteorite (assuming that its a condrite) would behave a lot like granite.

I've been in the art trade for classical antiquities for a while and a authentic sarissa spearhead is nothing like this. First of all they are made of iron, and second of all, the patination on this bronze is horribly done. Here is an example of an authentic sarissa being sold by a reputable dealer: authentic sarissa head. I own similar authentic examples of spearheads from Taras 4th cent.

Are they known for having fake artifacts? Are there any online source that says this?"
ArtefactPorn,39etdr,colinroberts,2,Fri Jun 12 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"This was one of the most frustrating things for me as I began collecting. The truth is that the antiquity trade has been going on since nobility in ancient Rome were collecting, and the process behind it hasn't changed in the last 2000 or so years. Everything (apart from ""small finds"" like your arrowhead) that is on the market now has been in private collections for the past 30 - 50 years, when the internet wasn't available and tools didn't exist to properly document provenance. That means it's incredibly difficult to find authoritative sources on who are reliable dealers, what's reliable provenance, and if ""reliable"" actually is reliable.   All I can say is that Paleodirect is not the most reliable when it comes to spearheads like the one OP posted. However, like I mentioned earlier, its more than likely that they sell these items along with smaller authentic finds like your arrowhead. If you really want to find out, I would contact Paleodirect and request some more information on how they know the arrowhead comes from a ""North Saharan exposed desert site"".    Remember that most dealers are focused on making profits by the end of the year, and that means they have wiggle room when selling in such a disorganized market. That means they aren't necessarily evil people trying to sell you fakes, they're just not willing to go into too much trouble trying to authenticate all of their pieces. If you want to post to a forum that can actually help you authenticate pieces, you should check out the ""ancientartifacts"" yahoo group. I also have a list of over 100 reputable dealers and auction houses that I could share, but it caters more towards roman, greek, egyptian, etc antiquities rather than tribal."

ArtefactPorn,39etdr,PiousHeathen,12,Thu Jun 11 22:37:55 2015 UTC,"This is the head of the Sarissa,  a 12-14 ft long infantry spear introduced by Philip II (Alexander the Great's father). Prior to Philip's reforms, the Macedonian army was a relatively weak when compared to its Theban or Athenian neighbours. Philip used intense military training with the Sarissa to create the first phalanx, a much more lightly armored and mobile unit than the heavy and expensive to equip Hoplite infantry that was traditionally fielded during the era. Combined with the Linothrax (a form of linen armor), Philip's phalanx would be used by Alexander to conquer lands all the way to Hydaspes river in modern India. It would not be until the Roman army used the system of Maniples and the greater mobility it offered that the phalanx would be truly defeated."

ArtefactPorn,39etdr,heliotach712,2,Thu Jun 11 19:22:41 2015 UTC,Philip's phalanx would be used by Alexander to conquer lands all the way to Hydaspes river in modern India.   the phalanx and the shock cavalry (Companions).
ArtefactPorn,39etdr,PiousHeathen,5,Thu Jun 11 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"If we want to be specific, Alexander used the Phalanx in combination with the ""Hetairoi"" (Companion Cavalry) as well as the use of ""Hypaspists"" (Elite heavy infantry in a similar style to a Greek Hoplite). Most important, in my opinion, is actually the wide array of siege engineers, surveyors, craftsmen, and new siege equipment like the Alexandrian Torsion Catapult that really made some of his victories possible. For example, the city of Tyre (in modern Lebanon) was once an island separated from the land by about 500m of water. Alexander had his engineers build a ""mole"" (an earthworks mound) over to the city to allow him to besiege it. This took roughly 6 months, and the city has never again been an island. It should be noted that as a reward for showing resistance towards him, the city was massacred, its woman and children sold into slavery, and untold numbers crucified along the coastline as a warning to other cities the price of resistance."
ArtefactPorn,39etdr,rac3r5,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"From what I read, he didn't win because of better units but rather, better tactics. For example when he fought against King Porus in India, he won because he attacked in the middle of the night."
ArtefactPorn,39etdr,PiousHeathen,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Alexander benefited greatly from the kingdom and reforms Philip instituted in Macedon. The Sarissa and Linothrax equipped troops did not need to carry much heavier armor through mountain passes, jungles, and deserts. The Sarissa offered an engagement range well beyond what most infantry were fielding, and while the lack of a shield made for some vulnerabilities against missle fire, this was made up for with mobility. Also, the most important factor in the use of the Sarissa is the training required to use it. A phalanx demands discipline among its members, and must move, drill, and attack in formation. Most of the armies faced by Philip and Alexander did not possess this kind of discipline. Alexander was a masterful tactician, if foolhardy and extremely lucky at times, but he won those battles on the backs of his men, and the heart of the Macedonian army was the Sarissa and Linothrax."
ArtefactPorn,39etdr,joinville_x,3,Thu Jun 11 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"Why is it bronze if it's from that era? Spear heads would usually be made of iron. Spear butt-spikes were often bronze, but not spear heads."

ArtefactPorn,39etdr,airborneleaf,-1,Thu Jun 11 21:21:37 2015 UTC,Every army at that time required soldiers to buy their own equipment. Iron is cheaper and easier to work so I imagine that's why they were mostly made of it.

I can't imagine spearheads had much more than a few kills each given the number of men in a pike block and the number of pike blocks in a battle, coupled with the relatively soft nature of bronze leading to regular replacements. Pikes weren't supposed to cut enemies down in droves. They held them there while the cavalry beat the enemy cavalry and circled around to charge in behind the enemy, delivering the killing blow.  Artifacts like this are usually in such good condition, or even simply found, because they weren't used in combat. Remember, 99.999% of the time, a soldier is marching, sleeping, eating, training, etc.  Edit: The spearhead OP posted is a fake"
ArtefactPorn,39bxp9,barbie_museum,18,Wed Jun 10 18:55:36 2015 UTC,Maybe someone more familiar with rome can recognize more stuff?  All i can see is Castel Sant Angelo since it is connected to the vatican by elevated pope escape route.
ArtefactPorn,39bxp9,Monorail5,3,Wed Jun 10 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"So I believe this image is from the perspective of the Holy See, mainly because the Pyramid of Cestius embedded in the Aurelian wall on the top right. Castel Sant'Angelo in the bottom center, left of the bridge (called the Ponte Sant'Angelo). Palazzo Laterano on the lop left, before the splitting of the aqueduct. I think the statue near that is the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius, but I can't really discern the hills very well (the statue is on the Capitoline). I can only assume the big gray figure next to the statue is the Colosseum. I think the circle with the jagged edges near the red building near the bottom left corner is the Mausoleum of Augustus. The Camp on the far left may be the Castra Praetoria but I'm not certain."
ArtefactPorn,39bxp9,sabjsc,5,Thu Jun 11 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"I suspect your identification of the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius is correct, since as far as we know it was the only equestrian statue to survive the middle ages, but the statue wasn't moved to the Capitoline Hill until 1538 when Michelangelo designed the Piazza del Campidoglio. Before that, it was located at the Lateran Palace, the main papal residence on the Caelian Hill! So that may help with identifying the hills: from top to bottom, I think the pictured hills are the Aventine, the Palatine, and the Capitoline. I believe the circular building next to the statue is meant to be the Colosseum, which is fairly close to the Lateran Palace, and perhaps the aqueduct is meant to be the Aqua Claudia, because that one has a similar fork to the picture. I'm not so great at Roman history in the Christian era, but those are my guesses."

Even hardened bodkins would not penetrate except the weakest areas (1-2mm on the extremities) at close range   I have read  the steel used was better than rolled hardened armor steel in some examples but that came at a hefty cost. My guess maybe 100,000 Euros each  or more in modern money   It was also  stiflingly hot and from experiments roughly doubled the rate of fatigue of the wearer."

Also the M1A1 (along with all modern MBTs) has really only got the reputation it has as being all but invincible from fighting second generation MBTs which had badly trained crews, and guerilla forces using decades old non-Russian AT weapons.

Unlike an axe or the edge of a sword though they did damage by kinetic energy transference not cutting though and as such were considered blunt  The poleaxe, warhammer  and its cousins the Crows Beak or Bec De Corbin  heavily relied on spikes to do injury other targeting joints or sometimes thin areas since even the best plate armor was  not of a uniform thickness  , it couldn't be.   One thing though, the harness above was basically impossible to cut even with an axe which is a huge advantage. or    The swords like the above as  airborneleaf mentioned , both longsword and greatsword were basically used like spears via a technique called halfswording.

ArtefactPorn,396irg,bnr55,15,Tue Jun 9 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"Not really, this is a bomber. One confirmed kill is impressive. The defensive guns act as a deterrent against fighters just lining up 100 yards behind the bomber and lighting it up.   And air combat is a fickle thing. It only takes 5 air to air kills for a fighter pilot to be considered an 'ace'.   My grandfather flew 88 missions over Italy in a P-47 (a fighter) in a ground attack configuration. No air to air kills."
ArtefactPorn,396irg,ProfessorBort,6,Tue Jun 9 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"I understand your point but 1 kill over two hundred missions is still exceptionally low.  To reference, here's a photo of the Memphis Belle after 25 missions."
ArtefactPorn,396irg,bnr55,22,Tue Jun 9 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"Different stages of the war and different aircraft.   A. They didn't call the B-17 the 'Flying Fortress' for nothing. It was absolutely bristling with defensive armament and flew in defensive formations maximizing defensive firepower. The B-26, depending on the variant, also carried an impressive amount of guns but most were configured in a manner that could be forward fired for strafing, as the B-26 was a two-engined medium bomber that flew low level strafing runs (almost like a fighter bomber) as often as it flew in high altitude level bombing formations.  B. The Flak-Bait participated in Overlord and the Bulge, suggesting that these 200 missions were mid-late war, at which point A. There was general allied air-superiority over much of Europe and B. the P-51 mustang long range escort fighter was fully in service. When the Memphis Belle finished its first 25 missions in May of 1943 the P-51s full integration into the 8th Airforce was still 7-8 months away. This means that the Belle was without fighter escort for the crucial parts of its missions and thus the B-17s were left to fend for themselves, arguably upping the likelihood that they would be shooting down German plans that later in the war would be distracted and dispatched by escort fighters.  That being said, I still think it's extraordinarily exceptional that the Belle managed to shoot down as many fighters as it did. It may be more than luck that that particular crew was the first to finish 25 missions unscathed."
ArtefactPorn,396irg,ProfessorBort,7,Tue Jun 9 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful response.  Very informative.  I certainly wasn't trying to impune the air abilities of the Flak-Bait, but my knowledge of WW2 bombers was that they pretty much flew the same style of missions.  Makes sense that they didn't shoot down many enemy fighters when there weren't many left to shoot down."
ArtefactPorn,396irg,LoveTruffle,4,Tue Jun 9 20:48:30 2015 UTC,I think I could live with that statistic.  Be it due to a lack of enemy air interception or having escorts who did a damn fine job.  I think being shot at by 88's would be stressful enough.

There was a saying ""two a day in tampa bay"" where pilots who were new to flying such a hot aircraft that had to land at high speeds as well. They could not handle such a aircraft and would crash  and die.  Once they had better training where they were showing the pilots how they have to maintain high speeds for the aircraft to work properly, that stopped."
ArtefactPorn,396irg,HughJorgens,2,Tue Jun 9 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"I would like to add that they also added six feet more wing to the B-26, which helped with the crazy take off and landings from wings that were too overloaded.

The Marauder had to be flown at exact airspeeds, particularly on final runway approach and when one engine was out. The 150 mph (241 km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to pilots who were used to much slower speeds, and whenever they slowed down below what the manual stated, the aircraft would stall and crash  One a day in tampa bay..... sheesh just correct me not fucking downvote  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_B-26_Marauder"

It's a tail dragger with a high engine profile. So to land he strafes it in a slipping drop and only puts it straight on the runway at the last second. An interesting experience for someone who has never seen it before lol.

They would heat the gold until it was extremely soft and stringy, then they would lift and stretch it until they got the right width.   Then cut and hit. Moulding.  If moulding was used it would be important to see which direction they were moulded in (vertically or horizontally.)  The heads of the gold pins do not look all that uniformly round. I would guess they were flattened out as part of being hit into place. I have no clue what I am talking about."

But imagine, for a moment, the chance that there was some sort of jig involved, and the regularity of the pattern is due to the pins being assembled in the jig, clamped or glued into a sheet in some way - as we do with tiny bathroom tiles - and then fastened to the bone. If they were glued to a leather or scraped parchment sheet, it would be easier to hammer or press the studs into the bone.   It's unwise to presume that our forebears were less lazy than we are."

ArtefactPorn,3880s7,zoso135,157,Tue Jun 2 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"There is no Napoleonic symbol more famous than that of the Imperial Eagles carried into battle by the French Army. Symbols of their Emperor’s grandeur, they were at the heart of each French regiment’s pride. During the six years of conflict in the Iberian peninsula, the British Army only succeeded in taking three eagles in battle.   At Waterloo they took two in five minutes.  Napoleon’s first serious attack on the Allied positions on the day of the battle was repulsed by the charge of the British heavy cavalry, the Union Brigade. The brigade’s Scottish regiment, the Scots Greys, smashed into the French 45th Regiment of the Line. Ensign Ewart, one of the Greys officers, told how “One [Frenchman]  made a thrust at my groin, I parried him off and cut him down through the head. A lancer came at me - I threw the lance off by my right side and cut him through the chin and upwards through the teeth. Next, a foot soldier fired at me and then charged me with his bayonet, which I also had the good luck to parry, and then I cut him down through the head.’  One of the brigade’s English regiments, the Royal Dragoons, were meanwhile carving into the French 105th Regiment. Exactly who captured their eagle was disputed, but it was carried, like that of the 45th, back to London in triumph. It remains there in the Tower, while that of the 45th resides in Edinburgh Castle. Both are currently on display in Edinburgh as part of the 200th anniversary commemorations"

On the other hand the French still holds bast colonial region from the French Guiana to the French Polynesia.

ArtefactPorn,38akjy,uncadul,2,Wed Jun 3 12:38:46 2015 UTC,I can't imagine that a copper knife would be better than a stone knife.  You would never be able to keep an edge for more than one or two cuts.
ArtefactPorn,38akjy,Nf1nk,4,Wed Jun 3 13:01:59 2015 UTC,There are no good sources of chert or obsidian in the western Great Lakes region so the Old Copper Complex made due with what they had. They eventually began trade relations with others to trade decorative goods for stone to make tools. Eventually they abandoned making copper tools all together and focused primarily on decorative items because of the high amount of imported stone. That tradition eventually extended to the Mississippian cultures

The material in contact with the water shrinking massively compared with the rest causing the bending.  There's a fair chance I'm completely wrong and the structure would've already cooled plenty in the air (at a slower, non warping, rate) and some other effect has occurred.  It may well be the impact with the ocean, thanks to the surface tension it's like hitting rock above a certain speed, but the fact the bending has happened at opposite sides of the diffuser makes me question that."

ArtefactPorn,37vdeu,OneMoGin,3,Sat May 30 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"West Mexico hasn't been heavily influenced by the cultures further east. There is very little Olmec influence during the Formative and little influence from Teotihuacan in the Classic. Instead they had the Capacha culture in the Early  and Middle Formative and the shaft tomb culture in the Late Formative to Classic. Michoacan is a little mysterious because few sites have been found within the state as opposed to other West Mexican states like Colima, Jalisco, Zacatecas, and Nayarit. To see such clear connections to Central Mexico is a little odd for West Mexico as a whole. Most scholars see West Mexico becoming incorporated into Mesoamerica during the Epiclassic and Postclassic when metallurgy begins to be used and the need for metals rise. That sentiment is becoming antiquated as work continues in West Mexico and we learn more about the cultures there. It wasn't that they weren't Mesoamerican, they just expressed Mesoamerican ideologies differently than their neighbors."

Born Paris. Travelled to Egypt at the age of 22; acquired an interest in the fine arts in Italy; acquired some knowledge of Arabic and Persian languages, and then travelled overland to Ceylon. Following a suggestion made by the Royal Geographical Society he lived among the Bakhtiari tribes of western Iran in 1840-42, publishing his account in 'Early Adventures'. He first visited Mesopotamia in 1841. He excavated most extensively at Nineveh and Nimrud in Assyria. He conducted two lengthy seasons of excavations in Assyria, from November 1845-June 1847 and from October 1849-April 1851. He first visited Khorsabad in August 1846 and returned to excavate there in November 1849.   After his early archaeological career he turned to politics, becoming MP for Aylesbury; Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1861-1866; British Ambassador to Spain, 1869-1877; Ambassador in Turkey, 1877-1881. He retired to live in Venice, developed an important collection of paintings (bequeathed to the National Gallery) and became a patron of the glass industry at Murano. His portrait is held by the Department of the Middle East in The British Museum, and his extensive papers, now mostly in the British Library, were bequeathed to the British Museum by his widow, Enid, in 1912.

ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Flaczki,3,Thu May 28 16:42:34 2015 UTC,She's Galla Placidia. Her father was from Hispania and mother side is from Illyria
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,iSmokeGauloises,1 point,Thu May 28 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Considering the stretches of the Roman Empire, it is certainly possible that she originated or had ancestors in the eastern mediterranean."
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Xorondras,-27,Thu May 28 09:40:27 2015 UTC,WTF is 'Lebanese' in the context of 400 AD?
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,oslo02,33,Wed May 27 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"I meant that, if I saw a girl that looked like the one on the right in real life, with no other context I'd think she was from Lebanon. I was comparing her a present-day context.    Of course, she could also be Italian, or Portuguese or Spanish. There's a lot of similarities across the Mediterranean (the Roman Empire having played no small part in that). Lebanese was just the first that came to mind for some reason.     I mean, this girl is Lebanese. I can see the resemblance."
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Lemon_Tree,-22,Wed May 27 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"So you see a portrait of a Roman family that, by your own admission, looks quite typically Mediterranean (or, you know, Roman), and you choose to remark that they look Lebanese?  There are villages in Northern Lebanon with high percentages of blond haired, blue eyed people, there are people who look predominantly Arabic, or have Asiatic traits.  I could go on, but the genetic diversity of Lebanon makes using it as a descriptor of what someone looks like, fairly useless.  The Crusades, the Arabic invasion, the Turkish invasions, and the attacks from the Illkhanate, all contributed to what the people are today.  Pretty much anyone can be said to look Lebanese,  lol."
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,oslo02,8,Thu May 28 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yes? I've never seen a living Roman, I don't have anything to associate them to (although, if I had to guess at what they looked like, like you say it'd be something close to typical Mediterranean, not counting what I'm sure were quite extensive regional variations).      Hence, to me (and this is of course subjective), the first thing that came to mind was that they looked Lebanese. Sure, that's because the subset of the Lebanese population that I associated them with happens to have pan-Mediterranean features, and sure, they definitely do look Roman, but not knowing any Romans in real life, that's the first association I made. Maybe the interesting comment here is that a lot of Mediterranean people still look very much like their ancient Roman predecessors (Perhaps that's a rather obvious observation, though)."
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Lemon_Tree,6,Thu May 28 03:53:43 2015 UTC,Someone who lives in what is now Lebanon?  I doubt the population has changed a whole ton.
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Aiskhulos,11,Wed May 27 23:00:29 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Arab and Turkish conquest added a lot of genetic diversity.
ArtefactPorn,37i5vs,Mac8v2,2,Wed May 27 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely people who look more Arab, but like any melting pot, you'll get glimpses of the different influences in different people. I'm not saying that's how all Lebanese people look, but they reminded me of Lebanese people I know."

ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,mynameisalso,10,Wed May 27 17:06:39 2015 UTC,Yea sure between people.  But between nations how does that check turn into usable money for Russia?
ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,SassyMoron,4,Wed May 27 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"Credit at a bank is ""usable money"" - nuggets of gold actually aren't. Also, nations have their own banks, and they also use private banks, so their situation isn't really any different than a person or company's from this perspective. There are any number of ways that the US could have fulfilled its obligation here. The Russian government almost literally was the Tsar at this time - he/they probably were looking to sell because they owed a lot of money. The banks that they owed could have transferred Russia's obligations to the US to fulfill it the debt."
ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,mynameisalso,4,Wed May 27 17:32:02 2015 UTC,Nuggets of God aren't usable?  News to me.
ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,SassyMoron,4,Wed May 27 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"In 1867, gold cost $27.86 an ounce, according to this site. So $7.2m in gold is roughly 8 tons of gold. Transporting that safely would require a huge military convoy. Also, to get from the US to Russia, it would have to go by sea, which was inherently fairly treacherous in the 1860's even without thinking about theft. Not to mention that it would take a couple of months, at least. So nuggets of cold would not be usable as money for two governments with timely obligations and other shit to do besides plan the logistics of moving around shiny bits of yellow metal."
ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,Interius,2,Wed May 27 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"In 1867, gold cost $27.86 an ounce, according to this site. So $7.2m in gold is roughly 8 tons of gold.   I calculated today worth of 8 tons of gold.   1 kg of gold is around 150 tys pln (40k usd)   8000*40k = 318.122299 million U.S. dollars And as op tilte says it was 120 milion with adjusted inflation, so gold has triple there value..."
ArtefactPorn,37fcfn,SassyMoron,1 point,Wed May 27 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"In raw purchasing power terms (based on some kind of index, like the CPI), that's correct. However if you'd, say, deposited that $27.86 in the bank, you would have gotten interest. Over the past 50 years the average interest rate on short term certificates of deposit has been about 5% - I'm not sure what it was from 1867 to 1960, but even if you only made 3%, with simple compounding, your $27.86 savings account would have become $2,212 today. By that same CPI method, that's $156 in 1867 dollars - in other words, you would have 5.5x your initial investment, in real purchasing power. If you'd made 5% on your savings account, you would have made 10x your money (in real purchasing power terms). So if you're saying gold would have been a good INVESTMENT over that time, than, no, that's wrong."

ArtefactPorn,37cbqf,breadnation,6,Wed May 27 02:49:24 2015 UTC,"The Oseberg ship was used as the burial place (and likely previously a pleasure craft) for a noblewoman and an elderly female companion. The exact position of the noblewoman is unknown, but burial goods included with her included 13 horses, 3 dogs, an ox, and an ornately carved wagon, and 3 sleighs. Also found was a carved and decorated chest, likely similar to which those who rowed would sit in and keep their belongings in.  The Osberg ship itself was built of oak, 70 ft long, and had a breadth of 17 ft. The carvings seen on the posts include the interlocking bodies of imaginary beasts.  Another important element of this ship, especially for archaeologists, is the well preserved steering oar seen in the photo. The construction is actually pretty ingenious. A combination of Old English and Norse words for the use of it contributed to why the right side of a vessel is now called the starboard side.   It is thought that this ship would make the rounds of the deep and relatively sheltered fjords of Norway."
ArtefactPorn,37cbqf,Archaeologyag,2,Wed May 27 02:13:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting note:  While taking a trip there last year with my ex (we lived close by, seemed silly not to go, you always take a trip every now and the if you live in Oslo), we got to talking with one of the curators who was showing a group of tourists around.  We talked a little bit about the museum itself, but then she decided to give a little tidbit the museum had been working on for a while; after extensive testing of the remains of the companion, they have concluded that she was most likely of arabic descent. Her teeth where well kept amongst other things, which they meant could suggest that she was a slave kept by the noblewoman, and then killed off so they could be buried together when the noble died of natural causes.  Not sure if they ever went public with the info or found out they where wrong, haven't been there since."

They weren't generally seaworthy, but could sail close to the coast without too much issue.  Snekkja, on the other hand, were more seaworthy, typically being longer than the Karvi and with higher topsides.  There is also the Knarr, which was made primarily as a merchant vessel, which could operate with a smaller crew and was generally more well suited for longer trips (with considerably more cargo room).

At the cost of elegance the broader bow would have made her quite capable of sailing the open sea.""

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,tomcam,4,Mon May 25 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, with something to dip. Like crackers or chips. It's so good though. You can use it as a spread too, for sandwiches and such."

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Schmucko,2,Tue May 26 10:23:18 2015 UTC,That does sound good. We usually just get standard sliced square-ish bread of different varieties (usually some kind of whole grain). That does sound good though. I'm not sure if they sell whole baguettes at the store I use though.
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Justin131113,1 point,Mon May 25 22:12:39 2015 UTC,you better find a bakery

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,etherag,2,Tue May 26 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"I eat it in lots of things - I like to have it on sandwiches, and I dip veggies in it, and I have a large number of recipes that use it. Sometimes, though, I just feel like a spoonful of hummus, like a spoonful of peanut butter."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,immature_eejit,5,Mon May 25 21:04:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound weird to me to just eat a spoonful of it by itself. I don't think I'd want to do it though because I feel like I have to use it as a dip or spread. Feels wasteful to eat it by itself. Sounds like it would make a good snack though, like eating pudding sort of."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,immature_eejit,2,Mon May 25 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"It's good as a very fast snack. A spoonful is about a serving, and it has a lot of protein, and more fiber/less sugar than a spoonful of peanut butter (which is a much more common snack, apparently). It is very much like a savory pudding."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,EPIDIDYMIS_HUMMUS,3,Mon May 25 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't gum up your mouth like peanut butter does. I like peanut butter, but it's like a weak adhesive for your mouth. Good to melt to pour on Ice Cream though. I usually get some sort of flavored hummus (most recently it was a garlic and hummus mixture). I enjoy the plain stuff too, but with all these other flavors I don't think we've ever bought plain hummus."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,deegeese,2,Mon May 25 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"I like frozen peanut butter best, and I eat it with cherries! It's really good that way.  My favorite type of hummus is a personal recipe that doubles the lemon and garlic. It's very smooth and tart-savory! Flavored hummus is really good - one of the local stores near me sells a sun dried tomato flavored hummus that is ridiculously good."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Hezekiah_the_Judean,3,Tue May 26 00:14:41 2015 UTC,My neighbor and his three year olds daughter do! They eat it with everything and straight from a spoon.
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Steve_OH,2,Mon May 25 20:39:11 2015 UTC,"I will, if I can get away with it! So, in other words, not in polite company. :D"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,magichocolateunicorn,2,Mon May 25 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"My parents always taught my siblings and I that there were times when maintaining politeness is less important than indulging in those things that truly bring you pleasure. I'm certain my dad just says it to justify his occasional silent and terrible crop-dusting of public spaces. However, I figure if he can use it to justify his puerile enjoyment of farts, I can use it to justify eating hummus with a spoon wherever the urge overtakes me, right?"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,frankenham,2,Tue May 26 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fine with that logic!"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,robinmhood,2,Tue May 26 22:36:26 2015 UTC,I also like hummus.

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,william_fontaine,21,Tue May 26 14:02:33 2015 UTC,I saw a tiny clay tablet receipt written in cuneiform for sale on a numismatics auction a few weeks ago.  Really wanted to buy it but it went out of my price range (few hundred $).  It was for exchanging garments for donkeys:  http://www.vauctions.com/ViewArchiveItem.asp?ID=29399
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,capturedguy,6,Mon May 25 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"It's incredible that someone can translate that, because to me it looks like a bunch of faded out scratches.   Under $400 is way less than I'd thought it would be worth, how old is it?"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,justwantedtologin,16,Mon May 25 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"Per the description, it's thought to be from 2111 BC to 2003 BC.  Really old artifacts can be surprisingly cheap.  That's what got me into ancient coin collecting - because of the lower demand, I can get coins from ~600 BC to ~1400 AD for affordable prices.  Of course, the really rare or extremely fine condition ancients still go for a LOT of money, but I care more about the history than perfect condition."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,william_fontaine,8,Mon May 25 16:13:12 2015 UTC,What are your top-ten fun coins that you acquired (and price paid)?
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,justwantedtologin,18,Mon May 25 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't kept very good records, but here's a few of my favorites that I've bought over the past few years:   Byzantine Constans II gold solidus ($300, 650AD) Greek Alexander the Great lifetime issue silver drachm ($150, about 325BC) and post-mortem silver tetradrachm ($200, about 310BC) Roman emporer Tiberius silver denarius ($200, 18-35AD) Persian silver siglos from the time of Artaxerxes I ($50, 450-480BC) Olbia bronze dolphin proto-coin ($25, about 500BC) Jewish bronze lepton of Alexander Janneus ($20, 103-76BC) Jewish bronze prutah of Pontius Pilate ($100, 26-36AD) Jewish bronze prutah of King Herod ($100, 40BC-4AD)   Annnd just recently made my biggest purchase, a silver Greek owl tetradrachm from Athens ($500, 450-400 BC).  They look pretty cool, are a great representation of the classical period of Greek coinage, and I've wanted one for a long time.  But that's the last coin I'm allowed to buy until next year :D"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,jericho,3,Mon May 25 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"This is an absolute awesome hobby, since over the ups and down of the global economy, the truly wealthy embrace hobbies such as stamps and coins.  Tell the wife that these will NOT go down in value, and will provide a tidy retirement."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Fitzjake,6,Mon May 25 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"Well no wife here, so it's easier to get these coins into the budget!  And exactly, the value of the coins is the reason I let myself get into the ancient coins hobby.  Unlike other a lot of other collector items these coins have historical significance, are made with precious metals, and I think they're pretty likely to keep their value.  I've also learned more about ancient civilizations through collecting coins than I did in history classes.  It makes history feel more real when I hold a coin that was made and spent 2500 years ago."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Eggyhead,4,Mon May 25 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"It's a great hobby. The educational value is awesome. I'm like you, and the historical significance of the items is the attraction for me."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Misaniovent,4,Tue May 26 02:59:23 2015 UTC,And to piggyback; Where do you find and buy them? EBay for old coins?
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,MOAR_cake,7,Mon May 25 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Some of them I picked up at local coin shows/sales.  Most people only deal in modern (1700AD+) coins, but if the show's big enough they'll usually have a few dealers with ancients.  Some of the shows get mentioned in the sub /r/ancientcoins.  I've also used a few reputable online sites:   vcoins.com for direct sales vauctions.com for auctions agoraauctions.com for auctions cngcoins.com for auctions   And for a couple of the cheaper coins when I was first starting out, I bought them from eBay auctions."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,creepyeyes,2,Mon May 25 17:58:34 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Thank you for the detail!

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,enumelish,13,Mon May 25 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"That's really impressive, but how do you distinguish one character from another?"
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Eggyhead,33,Mon May 25 14:32:17 2015 UTC,By learning to read Akkadian.
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,MOAR_cake,11,Mon May 25 15:20:46 2015 UTC,About the same as any written language.
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,badscribe,5,Mon May 25 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair, the writing on this tablet is far more cramped than most other writing systems, even ancient ones. Check out the rosetta stone or the writing system of ancient chinese (aka oracle script) for example, where even though we can't read those writing systems (except maaaybe the Greek) we can still discern where each symbol stops and starts, and what features they have."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,WolfBiedermanRocks,1 point,Mon May 25 20:35:52 2015 UTC,Can't we read all of those scripts?
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Eggyhead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:20:24 2015 UTC,I meant we as individuals
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Kirioko,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:10:34 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd argue many other systems ancient and modern that are just as hard to make out the individual signs if you haven't studied them.  Look at grass writing, or premodern kana, or modern Arabic."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Nuclear_Penetration,3,Thu Jun 18 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"Well, in many written languages, not all, there are spaces between characters that make it easy to distinguish each. Here I can't tell at all what I'm looking at other than some sort of writing."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Akoustyk,1 point,Mon May 25 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I'm assuming you haven't intensively studied ancient languages. I haven't either, but I think if you did and with a lot more time then reading modern languages, you could understand this."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Kirioko,3,Mon May 25 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"You just have to memorize the signs in order to distinguish them. It's just something you have to deal with in Akkadian and other cuneiform scripts. Although in Old Assyrian they sometimes used word dividers marked by the diš sign, but that was only for words, not signs. Also, reading from a clay tablet is different from reading line art provided by an author. So, it's definitely more difficult to distinguish signs on a clay tablet until you've gained a lot of experience."

I wonder if I'm going about this the wrong way... but, seriously, how does one read Akkadian? Everything looks like it runs together. It sounds like a beautiful language, but damn I'm confused on how to discern that this means anything.  Edit: Also, what are those seemingly 'blank' spots? There's a few down the center."

ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Nivius,4,Mon May 25 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"I can't believe people could easily read that. It seems to me like you'd want to leave a bit more space between letters, or idk. I guess maybe it was a space saver, and tablets were expensive."
ArtefactPorn,377f3w,Dent18,2,Mon May 25 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, they had to save as much space as possible. You can still see this even later on with Latin, but at least that alphabet is a bit easier to discern WHENITSALLTOGETHER."

Many denials of the Islamic State’s religious nature, he said, are rooted in an 'interfaith-Christian-nonsense tradition.'""   Wood further states, ""The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. 'Very' Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe.

The other weapons are all swords, specifically a basket hilted broadsword, a schiavona,  and several rapiers.   A dagger is basically just a knife with both edges sharpened and is primarily a thrusting weapon. There's no definitive line between a dagger and a sword.

They were believed to have been struck and created by a Samuel Brown who cleverly struck and then hid the coins until the statute of limitations ran out on his crimes. Then, by taking an ad out in the 1919 issue of ""The Numismatist"" (an early coin collector's magazine) in search of the coins at a price of $500 per each created a demand for them, showed them at conventions and ultimately sold them off. He never divulged the truth about the coins, and went to his grave with his secrets.   In 2010 a single coin fetched $3.7 Million USD at auction, thus making the coin the single most expensive coin in the world.   Of the 5 examples known to exist, only two are currently located in museums.   http://www.usacoinbook.com/coins/906/nickels/liberty/1913-P/ (Click this to see an image of all 5 coins)  The other three are in private collector's hands.

After listening to accounts of your life and going over old letters people wrote about you they agreed that you did in fact have brown hair. Does this mean that your descendants ""decided"" that your hair was brown? Was the color of your hair was dependant on their decision and was the tri-une nature of God was dependant on the decision of the Nicean council?"
ArtefactPorn,36fy5m,Akoustyk,1 point,Tue May 19 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it does, unless they find actual evidence that determines exactly what color my hair was, then yes it's just some people that made some decision as to what my hair color was.   If there is not proof, or a logical argument, or irrefutable observation that demonstrates a thing, and yet people hold an opinion pertaining to that thing, then this opinion was simply decided by human beings, and there is no reason to believe that it has anything to do with reality.   Either they possess the evidence to know what color of hair I had, or they do not. If they do, then the evidence speaks for itself, and no man decided anything. If they do not, then they decided, and have either made a lucky guess or not. Even if their guess might be an educated one, it would be a guess nonetheless.   In the case of God, obviously ghosts and spirits and Gods, and holy stuff doesn't exist, so it is clear that they just arbitrarily decided a thing.   If they actually did a proper evaluation, and found the real solution based on real evidence, then they would have arrived at the conclusion that jesus was just a man.   Christianity was anti-roman ideologies, before Constantine. It was in conflict with pagan religions. Religions had been historically used to brainwash and control populations by state authorities.   Once the state started determining anything to do with the religion, the thing jesus hoped to create died.   Jesus was a man, and prophet mohamed was a man. The tooth fairy doesn't exist, and neither does santa claus, and neither does vishnu, neither does jupiter, neither does zeus, etcetera. Men invented all of these things.   If men did not invent them, and decide everything about them, then it must be possible to show that they exist, without making the use of the opinion of any man.

Between 9 September and 9 October 1934 the Nazi Party Berlin newspaper Der Angriff, founded and controlled by Joseph Goebbels, published a series of twelve pro-Zionist articles by Mildenstein under the title A Nazi Goes to Palestine. In honour of his visit, the newspaper issued a commemorative medallion, with the swastika on one side and the Star of David on the other.  The Nazi's briefly toyed with an idea of promoting Zionism as a way of ""solving"" their Jewish problem by evicting all Jews and forcing them to move to Israel. Sadly they ended up taking a very different approach and decided to go the genocide route instead. Before they made their anti semitic views clear there were many Jews who believed in National Socialism and refused to believe that they would be betrayed by a country they felt a part of.  The title of this photo is ridiculous and reflects the fact that this medallion is sadly often used by holocaust deniers to try and ""prove"" there was a Zionist Nazi conspiracy.

Don't get me wrong, I love 8chan because it is one of the only websites in the world that promotes freedom of speech, and any politically incorrect opinion will be found there, retarded or not.

ArtefactPorn,36fkmg,BewareofCrisps,13,Tue May 19 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"Hitler's hand was never ""forced"" he mad a conscious decision to embark on the genocide of the Jewish and Roma people as well as homosexuals (I'm not making a distinction I just don't know the word for the attempted eradication of people of a sexual orientation). They were citizens of Germany and the countries occupied by Germany and had their rights stripped from them before being systematically murdered.  It would be the equivalent of me coming to power in America, telling all African Americans that they must give up their rights and property and leave the country and then when they didn't move and no countries took them killing them and saying my hand was ""forced"". It wasn't forced, it's an active choice.  That said the world knew of the persecution of the Jewish people and failed them. At the Évian Conference in 1938 that was called by Roosevelt to try and get countries to offer the Jews of Germany refuge only the Dominican Republic agreed to accept a significant number (100,000).  At the conference representatives from 32 countries and 39 private organizations and some 24 voluntary organizations met and formally discussed the issue of the persecution of the Jews and their lack of options among themselves, both orally and in writing.  Golda Meir, the attendee from what was then the Brittish mandate of Palestine, was the only representative of a landed Jewish constituency, but was she was not even permitted to speak or to participate in the proceedings except as an observer. Some 200 international journalists gathered at Évian to observe and report the conclave.  Of all the representatives there only 100,000 ""places"" could be found for a people on the brink of genocide (and the world was already aware of Hitler's plans as detailed in Mein Kampf and as seen after the Jews had their civil rights stripped from them through the enactment of the Nuremberg Laws"

ArtefactPorn,369jzs,Omnipraetor,5,Sun May 17 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Because swords are not just weapons. More often than not they are symbols of authority and power.   Common people generally weren't allowed to carry swords, which were expensive to produce (compared to spears and bows) and did not have other uses besides killing or wounding other people (spears and bows could be used to hunt).   A couple of good examples would be the samurai class having their swords as status symbols, or the German messer style sword which commoners were only  allowed to own due to a legal loophole (messer means knife, and they were built with handles like large knives instead of a peened pommel)."

ArtefactPorn,365vst,saberplane,4,Sat May 16 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"Helmets with faceplates were almost always used when underfire from ranged weapons or during a charge. After closing into melee it would simply be a case of quickly opening it or removing it depending on whether it had a lock for keeping it open or just a pin holding the whole thing on. This was the case for many helmets after 1000AD too.  Regardless of whether it fit well, the eye holes being that small and a good inch from your face would completely destroy your vision.

ArtefactPorn,36606k,innuendoPL,26,Sat May 16 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"Hell of a thing for the Romans, Teutoburg.  The Romans didn't play around though.  Though the shock at the slaughter was enormous, the Romans immediately began a slow, systematic process of preparing for the reconquest of the country. In 14 CE, just after Augustus' death and the accession of his heir and stepson Tiberius, a massive raid was conducted by the new emperor's nephew Germanicus. He attacked the Marsi in a surprise attack. The Bructeri, Tubanti, and Usipeti were roused by the attack and ambushed Germanicus on the way to the winter quarters, but were defeated with heavy losses....  ...After initial successful skirmishes in summer 15 CE, including the capture of Arminius' wife Thusnelda, the army visited the site of the first battle. According to Tacitus, they found heaps of bleached bones and severed skulls nailed to trees, which they buried, ""...looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood..."".  Under Germanicus, the Romans marched another army, along with allied Germanic auxiliaries, into Germania in 16 CE. He forced a crossing of the Weser near modern Minden, suffering some losses to a Germanic skirmishing force, and forced Arminius' army to stand in open battle at Idistaviso in the Battle of the Weser River. Germanicus' legions inflicted huge casualties on the Germanic armies while sustaining only minor losses. A final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover, repeating the pattern of high Germanic fatalities, which forced them to flee. In summer 16 CE, Caius Silius marched against the Chatti with 33,000 men. Germanicus invaded the Marsi a third time and devastated their land.  tl;dr While it was a huge blow to the psyche of a nation that was not accustomed to a loss like that, the Romans picked themselves up, dusted themselves off and made the German tribes pay for it within 5-7 years."

ArtefactPorn,36606k,Watty13,-7,Mon May 18 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me a peasant would willingly go to war and chance dying and leaving his wife and kids to starve if he dies? What financial/other advantage could that peasant possibly gain by risking his life to go fight in a foreign country in the King's army?  Aside from those brain dead moron fools that believe ""patriotism"" propaganda bullshit in which it states that if you love your country, you fight your government's fights.  The average peasant/citizen does not benefit from war, unless the enemy is at your gates and threatening to destroy your city.  I'm not about to risk my life because some lying prick politician tells me some other guy is my ""enemy"". Government over time has proven itself to be a lying corrupt entity (no matter which form of government you choose) that only serves its best interests, and the best interests of those who control the government (business).   Then again I have an extremely high IQ....so I'm not tricked/fooled as easily as most people are."

Most of the coins date from, 1472 to 1592 and are Netherlands nickels, half pennies and double nickels. There are also English and Spanish pieces. The face value is 50 guilders which today would be worth many thousand euros. It is quite rare to find a shoe full of money and is thought to have been either a prudent precaution against burglary or a miser’s hoard. The shoe leather is still in good condition.   Video"

This item and the similar dodecahedra are complicated but standardized castings made by students to show that they can adhere to a standard. To get a size that matches the masters, an apprentice must adhere to specified measurements both in the wax original, as well as the proportions of the alloy. Probably a graduation test.  A little more iffy:  The features and details are an abstract way of denoting a lineage. The various details and differences denote what school and/or master they studied under, without requiring literacy or a ledger of names, or even a common language. Two craftsmen could compare their polygons, a sort of bronze caster's handshake. Possibly useful for admittance into guild meetings.   My alternate theory is that they were military/government/guild tools used to create Scytale. The holes in the dodecahedra could be used to specify a certain stick diameter for the Caesar Cipher, while a string wrapped around five of the knobs would specify the stick length."
ArtefactPorn,3660ci,Jonruy,5,Sun May 17 07:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think any decorative object with no clearly identifiable purpose is quite possibly just that - decoration. Any functional purpose would probably be readily apparent, especially to people who are knowledgeable on that culture. This isn't some minor, lost tribe in Middle America we're talking about here, it's Roman.  In my living room right now sits a bowl. In that bowl are wasp-nest like things, giant acorn-like things, as well as balls made from woven sticks and diced sticks glued to a plastic ball. It's not entirely unlike potpourri, except visually stimulating instead of olfactorally stimulating.  Imagine someone 2,000 years ago having a similar ""decorative orbs in a bowl"" idea, but instead of wanting to create an impression of nature, that person wanted to create something modern. After all, Rome was a powerhouse of science and mathematics. This object has two dimensional patterns (triangles and concentric circles) set into a three dimensional object (icosahedron). It's hard to determine the exact scale from this picture, but I can imagine one or a couple of these adorning a table purely for decoration."

These elf attacks were believed to be responsible for many painful human and animal maladies, the causes of which were still of course unknown at that time in history.  Elfshot was described as a sudden shooting pain, like the pain one would experience with rheumatism, arthritis or muscle cramps. Belief in elfshot persisted into the 20th century in rural areas, and as proof, country folk would sometimes find small arrowheads (the remains of Neolithic or Mesolithic flints, or naturally-occurring spear-shaped stones) that were believed to be the magical weapons that caused the afflictions. The belief in elfshot begins in the Pagan Germanic period and this amulet is a very early and rare example."

River. At the fearfulness of my sovereignty, the terror of my frightful weapons, they became afraid; with their own weapons his nobles killed Giammu. Into Kitlala and Til-sha-mâr-ahi, I entered. I had my gods brought into his palaces. In his palaces I spread a banquet. His treasury I opened. I saw his wealth. His goods, his property, I carried off and brought to my city Assur. From Kitlala I departed. To Kâr-Shalmaneser I drew near. In (goat)-skin boats I crossed the Euphrates the second time, at its flood. The tribute of the kings on that side of the Euphrates,---of Sangara of Carchemish, of Kundashpi of Kumuhu (Commagene), of Arame son of Gûzi, of Lalli the Milidean, of Haiani son of Gahari, of Kalparoda of Hattina, of Kalparuda of Gurgum, - silver, gold, lead, copper, vessels of copper, at Ina-Assur-uttir-asbat, on that side of the Euphrates, on the river Sagur, which the people of Hatti call Pitru, there I received (it). From the Euphrates I departed, I drew near to Halman (Aleppo). They were afraid to fight with (me), they seized my feet. Silver, gold, as their tribute I received. I offered sacrifices before the god Adad of Halman. From Halman I departed. To the cities of Irhulêni, the Hamathite, I drew near. The cities of Adennu, Bargâ, Arganâ, his royal cities, I captured. His spoil, his property, the goods of his palaces, I brought out. I set fire to his palaces. From Argana I departed. To Karkar I drew near. Karkar, his royal city, I destroyed, I devastated, I burned with fire. 1,200 chariots, I,200 cavalry, 20,000 soldiers, of Hadad-ezer, of Aram (? Damascus); 700 chariots, 700 cavalry, 10,000* soldiers of Irhulêni of Hamath, 2,000 chariots, 10,000 soldiers of Ahab, the Israelite, 500 soldiers of the Gueans, 1,000 soldiers of the Musreans, 10 chariots, 10,000 soldiers of the Irkanateans, 200 soldiers of Matinuba'il, the Arvadite, 200 soldiers of the Usanateans, 30 chariots, [ ],000 soldiers of Adunu-ba'il, the Shianean, 1,000 camels of Gindibu', the Arabian, [ ],000 soldiers [of] Ba'sa, son of Ruhubi, the Ammonite, - these twelve kings he brought to his support; to offer battle and fight, they came against me. (Trusting) in the exalted might which Assur, the lord, had given (me), in the mighty weapons, which Nergal, who goes before me, had presented (to me), I battled with them. From Karkar, as far as the city of Gilzau, I routed them. 14,000 of their warriors I slew with the sword. Like Adad, I rained destruction upon them. I scattered their corpses far and wide, (and) covered (lit.., filled) the face of the desolate plain with their widespreading armies. With (my) weapons I made their blood to flow down the valleys(?) of the land. The plain was too small to let their bodies fall, the wide countryside was used up in burying them. With their bodies I spanned the Arantu (Orotes) as with a bridge(?). In that battle I took from them their chariots, their cavalry, their horses, broken to the yoke. (*Possibly 20,000)"

While he's not a particularly well-remembered figure, parts of his story do have lasting presence in the modern mindset. Ahab's wife was Jezebel, a name that still has negative connotations to this day, and one of Ahab's main sins was pushing Isreal towards worshiping the god Baal, the god from which the demonic name Beelzebub derives from."

""this ornament depicts the winged lion-monster but here two creatures are shown rampant. In place of the lion's ears they have those of a bull. Horns curl back over spiky manes and the lion's neck is covered with a feather pattern. Sharply stylized wings extend over two of the five bosses and serve as decorative balace for the design. Heavy rings attached to the back suggest that the ornament was worn on a leather belt. the similar treatment of the lion motif on different types of objects demonstrates decorative conventions of the period."""

The extra ring provides a bit of structural support.  In addition, look at the way how the part where the user would've looped his arm through is attached - Those bars attached to the structure would absorb some of the impact, allowing Phillip to perhaps block a heavier blow without breaking his arm."

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,thoriginal,2,Tue May 12 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"If I'm remembering correctly, the hammer part is for armored opponents and the curved spike is to hook opponent's weapons away, neither of which really seems relevant to fighting zombies."

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,GrungeLord,3,Wed May 13 00:06:31 2015 UTC,The curved hook was more used for pulling opponents off horses but it's possible to snag weapons/shields with them.   Also halberds all the way for zombies.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,recreational,2,Wed May 13 01:19:18 2015 UTC,The spike would also do a serious amount of damage to an armored opponent. Imagine hitting someone with the spike side with a full swing. That would most likely pierce plate armor and would definitely go right through mail armor. The hammer side is for breaking bones and crushing blows. The spike side is for punching through anything or hooking but you risk getting it stuck.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,sethky,2,Wed May 13 10:29:29 2015 UTC,"I think it was mostly used to knock the fuck out of armoured soldiers, the actual kill would likely be with a knife or sword.  But i´m just guessing here"
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,frankwilliam,15,Tue May 12 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"They were actually fairly lethal, even more so to people in plate armor.  The shock wave of a solid hit would vibrate right through the plate at the point of impact, travel through the soldiers internals then bounce back inward when it reached the rear set of plate.  It was rudimentary version of the threat bullets possess with their hydrostatic shock.  Though if you survived your initial wounds you were likely to see another day, where as with a sword you would likely bleed out even if you survived an early mortal wound."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,LoveTruffle,7,Tue May 12 22:47:48 2015 UTC,"Warhammers were also a good way to finish off opponents who've been downed and wounded by other weapons. They excavated mass graves from the Battle of Towton (1461) and numerous skeletons had square holes punched through their heads from these things on top of dozens of other injuries horrific. If you were shot with arrows or hacked at with a sword enough to no longer be a threat, they'd just leave you for dead and move onto the next guy, then bludgeon you later."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,magichocolateunicorn,3,Wed May 13 01:02:55 2015 UTC,I would assume the little spike part would be plenty.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,griii2,43,Tue May 12 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"The hammer was used against armor that couldn't be penetrated with the thorn. Armor doesn't provide much protection against blunt force. If you think you can penetrate the armor or there is no armor? Use the thorn, if you can't you might as well just beat him into submission. If you can't penetrate the armor deep enough you just waste energy. It just gives versatility in a fight."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,DerKenz,16,Tue May 12 13:40:17 2015 UTC,"It breaks bones as well.  Massive muscle bruising and nerve shock (ever get a ""dead leg"" from a friend?  That's why cops with batons go for the legs, makes the whole thing go limp).  Additionally, bent and dented armor is uncomfortable and harder to move in.    Plus a whack on the helmet with one of those things will put your lights out even if it doesn't penetrate."

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Elbie79,3,Wed May 13 08:03:10 2015 UTC,"Actually chain with a gamberson under it would defend alright as long as the hit wasn't head on. Even then, it would help quite a bit. Still, blunt or specific thrusting weapons are the way to go, a cut from a sword may transfer some impact, but its just never going to get through. A cut from a two handed axe might, but would still likely fail to penetrate."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Apollo78,3,Tue May 12 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's why the medieval era saw such a vast array of weapons and armor.  Each made to tackle a specific task.  Fascinating in a morbid sort of way."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,LoveTruffle,2,Tue May 12 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing is the specialization of swords. Axes, hammers and other swung weapons, not to downplay them, could all be modified to suit a different context of use in ways that didn't seem to affect how they were used to greatly. An armor spike here, some sharp bits on the flanges, you get the picture. Swords, like this Estoc here, due to the drastically different qualities required for a cutting or thrusting blade, had to either completely specialize, as shown here, or pick a point of compromise like this longsword"
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Apollo78,1 point,Wed May 13 00:14:26 2015 UTC,if your opponent is wearing chainmail youd want to use the pike at the end and stab them. chainmail protects really well against slashes from bladed weapons but are very poor against stabbing. also stabbing is more likely to kill a motha fucka faster
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,JasonChernow,-4,Tue Jun 30 14:59:03 2015 UTC,Chain mail is actually quite good at dispersing the force of a blunt blow. Ideally you'd want a stiletto or similar pointy instrument to be the most effective against chain mail.
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,SqueakySniper,16,Tue May 12 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Chainmaille is only as good as the padding behind it, because the maille itself does little to spread the force of a blunt blow.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,DASBEERBOOTJAH,38,Tue May 12 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"Blacksmith here. The split-face hammerhead directed more force to four concentrated points. Steel production and tempering at that time was as much art and alchemy as science (they couldn't empirically measure impurities and carbon concentrations as we do today, and it was hard to achieve an even temper), and this configuration delivered a blow in such as way as to be more likely to crack the steel. Cracked helm or breastplate? The next blow is likely to be the last one your enemy needs to land.  Edit: in later times it was a common test for an armorsmith to shoot a musket ball at a breastplate to prove it was high-quality and well-tempered. It would be delivered to the new owner with the musketball dent."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,BillionTonsHyperbole,11,Tue May 12 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"It would be delivered to the new owner with the musketball dent.   Interesting. So, basically, what we know today as proof marks."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,KYLYKaHYT,9,Tue May 12 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Ancient coins also bear similar scars; it was common to notch or centerpunch them in order to show that they were precious metal all through.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,ThatBlokeBill,3,Tue May 12 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"It is to provide ""bite"" so that your strike, when it hits, does not slip or skid on the armor plate. That way more energy is transferred into the plate and body of your target.  As plate armor and chainmail evolved and became more common heavier striking weapons saw an upswing in popularity. Weapons like axes, warhammers and maces. It might have mainly been in response to how very widespread the use of decent quality chainmail became.   You can not cut chainmail reliably with a sword so blunt force trauma was the answer"
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Gulanga,4,Tue May 12 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"You could rarely penetrate armor with a hammer like this, but the hammer-side can give you mean dents to your armor and concussions. The thorn would mostly be for hooking I presume."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,OnkelMickwald,13,Tue May 12 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not the ridiculous body-length warhammer you would find in games like Skyrim.  Warhammers like this were used  (aside from serious brain damage) to quickly smack and dent heavy metal armour to prevent the enemy from being able to move their arm/leg/neck, so they was more vulnerable to precise hits with the thorned-ends of the warhammer."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,VostokApollo,2,Tue May 12 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"No, they weren't made to dent at all. The energy from a blow transfers through the plate and into the body. Simply denting a plate won't do anything, because armour isn't made in a way that denting it will prevent movement."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,airborneleaf,1 point,Tue May 12 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"I would be inclined to agree with you, but I'm pretty sure the Frazier Arms Museum is accurate in its description of denting the ends of knee-caps and elbow-caps to prevent movement in limbs, at least in early heavy armour warfare.  It is true, however, that hammers were used to blast energy through armour in a brutal, yet effective manner, like hammering a  can of vienna sausages."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,VostokApollo,0,Wed May 13 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that. Doesn't it make sense to assume that if you have the time and the space to deliver a blow to an elbow or knee strong enough to dent the armour (that isn't fixed in place, but has a certain amount of give), that you would also be able to hit the head? It's possible they got their description from writings about the use of warhammers, from back when writers tended to ue a large amount of creative license when describing a weapon if they simply didn't make things up.  If I had to guess, I'd say the description is written by someone who doesn't know all that much about war hammers in general, which is actually surprisingly common in museums, military ones especially. It's also possible that they took the idea from an old text that was written by someone who saw someone hit by a war hammer in a limb and lose use of it. He either damaged his armour to the use of it not functioning properly (highly unlikely since not even full plate in the Late Middle Ages was constructed in way that would allow it), or his bone was broken. Like he'd know which was which when he was just there to document the battle and had little to no knowledge of warfare.  Armour would get dented by percussion weapons, of course, but the dent would do very little to impede the wearer, especially when the blow itself had already caused significant damage."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,airborneleaf,1 point,Wed May 13 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that the long two handed warhammers from skyrim were also a kind of weapon.

EDIT*   The hammers that looked like this: http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121012152427/elderscrolls/images/e/e0/IronWarhammer_SK.png  However, their haft being longer, the head would remain similar in weight and size to the 2.5 foot ones, such as the example OP posted."

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Hygrocybe,1 point,Wed May 13 10:22:05 2015 UTC,Robert's war hammer would honestly be better described as a war maul (a subcategory of for super heavy war hammers).
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Defengar,5,Wed May 13 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't picturing it held one-handed. My weight range included mallets.  There's no such official subcategory, I'm afraid. Heavy, two-handed mauls were never used as weapons of war. There are a couple accounts of English longbowmen using their mallets in a pinch, but those were 3-4 pound tools with wooden heads bound in lead, not super-heavy warhammers.  In general, a heavy weapon is a bad weapon. Sure, a ridiculously strong person could swing a 20-pound maul at a stationary target a few times, but if they went up against a live opponent, their opponent would only need to step back out of range as the maul swings. Before the person with the maul can check its momentum and bring it back around, no matter how strong they are, their opponent is going to step back in and fuck them up - especially since if you're using a maul with two hands, you've got no shield. The person with the maul would be better off dropping it like a baseball bat after a swing, and pulling a dagger. Speed and/or reach will beat weight every time, because inertia acts just as much against you as for you. Robert would be better off using a normal-weight weapon swung with excessive force than a silly fanon 50-pound maul. Or maybe the 10-pound maul, which is still unrealistically heavy."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,apologeticCultist,2,Wed May 13 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"It's important during these discussions to remember GoT is fantasy. I was talking in the context of him using a 10 pound hammer. Robert in his prime is described as being borderline superhuman. He's someone who wields a weapon that would barely be usable as a ceremonial piece for others, runs around in plate armor like it's not even there, and can take on the best warriors of his generation in hand to hand combat and barely break a sweat."
ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,Defengar,3,Wed May 13 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. It just tends to be more realistic fantasy than most, hence my proposition of 20 pounds for an oversized hammer rather than 50.

ArtefactPorn,35p8e7,apologeticCultist,1 point,Wed May 13 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"Sure. I can only think of a few real life humans who could probably wield a maul effectively, and they're all on the borderline superhuman side themselves. Angus MacAskill being one of them. The man was the largest ""natural giant"" ever (as in everything was proportional and he didn't suffer any health problems from his size). He stood 7'9, weighed over 450 pounds during his peak physical years working with P.T. Barnum's circus, and had an 80 inch chest (the largest of any non obese man in history).

ArtefactPorn,35p90i,_axaxaxax,5,Thu May 14 13:07:55 2015 UTC,That's the myth about it. Most likely it was used like any other offhand dagger to catch and bind opposing blades.
ArtefactPorn,35p90i,Saelyre,0,Thu May 14 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I could imagine, if it were pretty stoutly made, with some thickness to it, that if you could get an opponents sword in the slots, you could torque on it like a weird sort of lever, with the bottom pushing the sword away from you and the top drawing part of the sword into you, putting pressure on the area between these points and snapping the sword."
ArtefactPorn,35p90i,_axaxaxax,1 point,Sat May 16 14:31:43 2015 UTC,Swords were made to have a decent amount of flex in them though otherwise they would have broken in battle pretty frequently. I don't doubt the this was a great tool for trapping your opponents blade and evem disarming him but i don't think that you'd be able to easily apply the kind of pressure it would take to snap a blade in the middle of combat
ArtefactPorn,35p90i,Meglomaniac,0,Sat May 16 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"If you immediately put your whole body weight with a twist into the knife you could likely snap the blade, or at least twist the blade out of the opponents hand."

In the middle of a sword fight, just a momentary pause in your opponents defense, such as catching his sword and/or pining it out of the way for a few seconds is all you need to overpower/outmaneuver him. Breaking it isn't needed and swords are valuable, no wish to break something you can sell."

ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Areyoucussingwithme,19,Sun May 10 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"They were used in battle, but were also featured very prominently as ceremonial items. They are still used as such by the Swiss Guard, who are traditionally the personal guard of the Pope."
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Dack9,4,Mon May 11 01:25:56 2015 UTC,"Why do the Swiss guard a man based in Italy/The Vatican? They don't even border each other, do they?"
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Rock_Carlos,20,Mon May 11 07:22:48 2015 UTC,"Starting in the 15th century, the Swiss Guard were popular mercenary armies, and were also hired as a sort of security for various courts and treaty meetings. This included the Vatican/Rome. At the time they were considered among the best troops in Europe and fought for several different armies. The Pope at a certain time hired a number of these mercenaries as a permanent guard, and the Swiss mercenaries took it upon themselves, and felt it a great honor, to personally defend the home of Christianity.   It is a requirement to be a devout Catholic to be a Swiss Guard. They are also recruited from the Swiss military, if they are considered somewhat exceptional.  Despite the silly outfits, they are actually extensively trained in combat with a sword as well as a halberd; and of course modern firearms."
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Dack9,0,Mon May 11 08:32:05 2015 UTC,"Sooo, are we going to see halberds in the next wargame with European setting?"
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Pherma95,7,Mon May 11 18:06:20 2015 UTC,"In the late middle ages/renaissance, the Swiss were the regarded as the best soldiers in Europe, and Swiss mercenaries were extremely popular. The Pontifical Swiss Guard are a remnant of an alliance between the Swiss Confederation and the Papal states, which provided the pope with a constant force of Swiss troops at his call. The agreement has been annulled and reinstituted several times throughout history."
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Commodorez,5,Mon May 11 08:53:25 2015 UTC,"Probably not by your average foot soldier. One of the key advantages of the halberd was that they were cheap and easy to mass produce, so your typical grunt was most likely not using one with richly detailed scrollwork.   A common halberd probably looked something like what you see here: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/f/f4/Pole-arm-examples1.jpg (edit: changed to higher resolution image)  But the OC could've been wielded by court guards and as such be functional in design but mostly decorative in practice."
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,FirstTimeWang,2,Mon May 11 01:52:13 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.

ArtefactPorn,35irlt,FirstTimeWang,4,Mon May 11 13:36:19 2015 UTC,"Very unlikely that it was made for combat. Halberds were relatively cheap, and something as elaborate as this would be very expensive in comparison.  It's common to think that weapons with elaborate decoration were often used by wealthy nobles and royal guards, but it's usually the case that they'd use plain weapons that just have better build quality, so it's likely that this is just a ceremonial/parade piece. Professional fighters weren't stupid, so why would they pay a heck of a lot more money to make a weapon look pretty when they could pay to make it actually better?  Most weapons that are preserved this well are so because they weren't used, so it makes sense to conclude that a preserved weapon with this much decoration wasn't even intended to be used."

As the halberd was eventually refined, its point was more fully developed to allow it to better deal with spears and pikes (also able to push back approaching horsemen), as was the hook opposite the axe head, which could be used to pull horsemen to the ground."

To cleave a man in twain, you would need to swing it with quite a lot of force and / or speed, which means holding it at the opposite end to gain enough momentum. Aiming isn't very easy that way, and you'd risk breaking the shaft when missing.   You'd be better off stabbing your opponent with either pointy bit."

ArtefactPorn,35irlt,Dack9,1 point,Mon May 11 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed, the descriptions of actual combat use of them describe them as basically being a spear that has some usefulness when swung; however the largest advantage over a spear being that they could be used to pull mounted enemies off of their horses."
ArtefactPorn,35irlt,airborneleaf,1 point,Mon May 11 08:06:26 2015 UTC,"You heard/read wrong. Weapons aren't designed to do that. If they were, they would have very heavy blades made to be used by very big people.  Unless it's used out of combat against a person stretched out above the ground, which would not be at all a testament to the weapon's ability since that is as far from battlefield conditions as possible."

ArtefactPorn,35it5a,Toby-one,6,Mon May 11 00:41:07 2015 UTC,This was not a parade armour this was a Carousel armour. Carousel was a form of tourney that was popularised by Henry IV of France as a safer form of jousting. It was basically a way for the nobles to display their equine skill without risking the life of the important nobles in actual jousting. It peaked in popularity in the 18th century but continued in some form or other into the 19th century.  This armour is dated to 1777 which was during the reign of Gustav III who was known to be particularly fond of hosting these display tourneys. And because it came up in other comments here it was Axel von Fersen the Younger who is said to have had an affair with Marie Antoinette.

ArtefactPorn,35f5as,squibb2,11,Sun May 10 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"I assume you're not questioning this specific case but the practice of excavating graves in general? Besides the fact that this would be the end of archaeology, I think this criticism is based on problematic assumptions concerning death.   It has been proven (e. g. by the ethnographer Jan Vansina) that people are generally only remembered by three generations after their death. This is valid for societies without written records but also for those like most modern  western societies who document everything. People might now know the name of their grand-grand-grandmother but that's out in most cases. There's no concept of this person besides the name and - in many cases - there is no grave. There might be exceptions, especially in societies that base power on kinship - but those are relatively modern phenomena that only applies to the elites.  So, concerning your question: I think we have every right, because nobody even remotely cares, or has a concept of the deceased as a living being."

ArtefactPorn,35g65q,tighttummies,13,Sun May 10 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"This particular dagger was found in a battlefield in woods outside Northeim, Germany. Roman insignia and braiding from uniforms and breastplates were found, but the clincher was the discovery of Roman coins bearing the image of the Emperor Commodus, who ruled from 180 to 192 AD. Radiocarbon dating of a wooden piece attached to an arrow head puts the date between 200 and 250 AD.  The find indicates that Roman Legions were still fighting Germanic tribes deep inside ""barbarian"" territory as late as the 3rd Century AD -- 200 years later than hitherto believed.  Link to album of 5 more daggers.   EDIT: This dagger was used by some fake news website late last year to say that Roman soldiers were in Ireland fighting some clan, so I've deleted all references to that. The info above is from the chief archaeologist at the dig who is Petra Loenne. Also, Dr. Henning Hassmann, director of historic preservation in the state of Lower Saxony, has been interviewed about it. And the find was back in 2008, so it's probably no big deal now. I googled the archaeologist's name and got a credible source."

Yet the remains in Dorset also suggest that these men were something unique. Researchers have found that one of the men’s teeth had incisions. This rare feature could, it is believed, be the result of the victim filing his teeth deliberately to demonstrate his bravery and status.  Further analysis then reveals that the St. Brice’s day massacre victims in Oxford were killed in a frenzied mob attack. However, the Ridgeway Hill individuals were systematically executed. They were beheaded from the front - just like the warriors in the Jomsviking saga. In the saga, one captured Viking says: “I am content to die as are all our comrades. But I will not let myself be slaughtered like a sheep. I would rather face the blow. Strike straight at my face and watch carefully if I pale at all.”  Both traits link the execution victims to a group which, if not the Jomsvikings themselves, had similar principles and beliefs    See more at: http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/viking-mass-grave-linked-to-elite-killers-of-the-medieval-world#sthash.Y3djx3dZ.dpuf"

ArtefactPorn,35clrl,BeatDigger,20,Sat May 9 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"At the time, the Romans would have called 80 AD ""the year of the Consulship of Augustus and Domitianus.""  They dated their years by who were Consuls of the Senate.  Augustus here refers to the Emperor Titus, and his full name and titles is written out on the first line, around the break in the bronze sheet. It reads as follows:  IMP TITVS CAESA[R DIVI VESPASIA]NI F VESPASIA NVS AVGVSTVS [PONTIFEX MAXIM]MVS TRIBUNIC POTESTAT VIIII I[MP XV P P CENS]OR COS VIII   Or: Imperator (roughly, emperor) Titus Caesar, son of the deified Vespasian, Vespasianus Augustus, Greatest Bridge Builder (head of the Roman religion), Tribunal Power (since emperors could not be actual Tribunes, but had their power) 9, Imperator 25, Pater Patriae (literally father of the country), Census Taker (with official powers), Consul (head of the Senate) 8.  *edit: I filled in the missing part in the brackets thanks to the transcription I found.  I'm still going over the whole text to find where Domitianus is mentioned. He must be, or we wouldn't be totally clear that this should be dated 80 AD.  *edit: it is made clear by mentioning that this is in Titus' 8th Consulship.  And June 13 is two days before the Ides (the 15th) and I believe they would write that as AD II IDES IVN for ante dies 2 ides juniae.  *edit:  The Ides of June is the 13th.  It is specifically mentioned in the text as IDIBVS IVNIS.  To clarify things later on, the Romans and those who studied them began using a dating format based on the year of the mythical founding of Rome, 753 BC. They called it ""ab urbe condita"" or ""since the city was founded."" That would make this 833 AUC, but that dating system was not very commonly used at this period."
ArtefactPorn,35clrl,Evotras,6,Sat May 9 02:12:37 2015 UTC,"During the Roman Republic, years were named after the consuls, who were elected annually (see List of Republican Roman Consuls).

For example, 205 BC was ""The year of the consulship of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Publius Licinius Crassus"", who took office on 15 March of that year, and their consular year ran until 14 March 204 BC.   source  So apparently the years were named, not numbered."

Some were even made from barbed wire.  Source for the photo.  Info.  Photo of a crows nest made out of barbed wire in 1930's Amarillo Texas.

In the 1930s, farmers didn't know there was a need for cover crops or anything to keep the soil down because usually the soil was kept down by the abundance of rain, so when several years of diminishing rainfall totals, added to the fact that farmers had depleted a lot of their soil by constant and repeated planting, all the ground needed was one moderate drought.

Although it is impossible to ascertain to which ‘opening’ of the tumulus Campion is alluding here, the ‘discovery of a helmet’ [33] may perhaps refer to an ancient Greek helmet of the Corinthian type with a skull purportedly found inside it, allegedly in 1834, and now in the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada.

ArtefactPorn,353edh,GoldenBough,4,Thu May 7 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"The three I mentioned are based on the standard forensic reconstruction methods. But they should be judged in a case by case method. Philip's and Lady's bodies were cremated, so there is a level of uncertainty, as the bones warp under intense heat. The simple burial of the little girl preserved the bones better, so her appearance is more accurate.  As for actual depictions, sadly, greeks didn't really develop intividual portraits, either in sculpture or in vase painting. They had ""generic"" types, i.e. old man, general, heroic dead, poet, that varied mainly in the slight aging of the head and the attributes of each.  As for the portraits of the dead, you may want to look into the fayum panels that were painted during their lifetime and placed over their mummies. These are stunning examples of painting, and give us an idea of thei original appearance."
ArtefactPorn,353edh,LucretiusCarus,0,Thu May 7 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"Probably to weaken the metal so that could be bent to make a corner (or seam) there. The bent edge would act to reinforce the metal. Making it more difficult to bend or deflect there. A little bit like the edge of an I beam or Cee section. The holes were probably easy to make with something like an ice pick, and once the edge is bent the holes don't really cause any weakening of the metal. Something like pliers might have been used to bend the edge.  Or a small hammer and some kind of anvil edge.   Notice how the bent edge reinforces the area over the bridge of the nose. Probably allows a thinner metal to perform the job of thicker, heaverier material. The lower edge might have been brought back to form a edge seam, making the edge less sharp, slightly reinforced, and more comfertable to wear.  Its possible that this helmet was especially thin, and not heavy enough to bother to reuse or melt down."
ArtefactPorn,353edh,WonderWheeler,3,Thu May 7 03:04:01 2015 UTC,I'm really impressed by its thickness. The metal seems to be over 1 cm thick at the nose.

ArtefactPorn,353dlf,Atanar,1 point,Wed May 6 23:31:00 2015 UTC,I don't think it would be very thick. That amount of metal has to be heavy.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,itsdietz,2,Thu May 7 11:05:28 2015 UTC,They were definitely thick and heavy. But that was okay for how the Spartans fought.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,sparks1990,1 point,Thu May 7 13:27:38 2015 UTC,I don't think he human body would be capable to lift a solid bronze hunk of metal for long enough to be worth while. Most shields where made with a metal boss in the center and the rest wood. The roman scutum was roughly 6 lbs.  These had to have been a somewhat thin layer of bronze over wood or some other backing. I'm not talking foil thin but thin nonetheless. It just seems too heavy to be practical.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,itsdietz,5,Thu May 7 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"The Old Bashing Shield The main purpose of the Spartan shield was defensive; however Spartans also used it to bash their opponents. This could be to stun them, knock them down or get some room to use another weapon. The shield could also be used as a killing weapon outright, its weight and thin edge making it a superb blunt weapon. The hoplite shield, or aspis (although it is commonly called a ‘hoplon’), was heavy, weighing about 30 pounds. They were constructed out of wood with an outer layer of bronze. Due to its defensive nature, Spartans using it as a weapon could gain the advantage of surprise. Being clubbed to death by heavy shield may have even been more unpleasant then being hacked apart by a Kopis!   http://www.ancientmilitary.com/spartan-weapons.htm"
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,sparks1990,1 point,Thu May 7 23:50:11 2015 UTC,But what is that number based on? This raises more question than it answers.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,Atanar,1 point,Thu May 7 23:55:50 2015 UTC,Have you tried holding up 30 lbs with your arm for extended periods to time? It had to either be slung around their shoulder for that.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,itsdietz,2,Fri May 8 03:33:16 2015 UTC,"Other estimates put it around 16lb, which is still pretty heavy."
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,sparks1990,1 point,Fri May 8 03:57:08 2015 UTC,That's much more manageable.
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,itsdietz,2,Fri May 8 05:05:35 2015 UTC,"The difficulty of holding 30 lbs on an arm is really dependent on the shape of the weight. Yeah something as dense as a dumbbell might be hard to hold for longer than an hour, but stretch the weight thin and wide (round) and then strap it to the entire forearm, bend the forearms and keep it very close/touch your chest. 30 lbs will be manageable, especially with training."
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,GeorgeNorman,3,Sun May 17 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"I had a long explanation typed out to counter your point  but my phone flipped out and... Its gone. So, I'll just make it short.  The M240B machine gun weighs roughly ~25lbs or so and even with sling for support soldiers will often pass the load between each other."
ArtefactPorn,353dlf,itsdietz,2,Mon May 18 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. It made me search the web for more information and I think you're right. 25-30 lbs seems a bit much for an average to athletic human to hold for long periods of time regardless of weight distribution (unless it's a backpack or on the shoulders).  I found a site for roman/Greek warfare role playing and they do their best to create the closest replica of a hoplite's aspis. The weight of an aspis was disputed and it seems that they think it is closer to 15 lbs which is manageable.   What is clear is that the aspis was NOT as horribly heavy and cumbersome as often described.  A total weight of 12 to 15 pounds seems likely.   Looking up videos of an M60 being shot standing up I found FPS Russia's video on YouTube. He described shooting it as extremely heavy and needed to take breaks.   The only website I could find that claims a Hoplon weighs 25 lbs is a wiki for the video game Deadliest Warrior, a video game. So yeah, it doesn't seem too credible."

ArtefactPorn,351qto,Tiako,1 point,Wed May 6 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"It was certainly a source of inspiration, but the copies that survived seem rather bland. The varvakeios Athena is the best of them and still lacks the grandeur and mobility that's associated with Pheidias."

ArtefactPorn,351qto,Tiako,1 point,Wed May 6 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"The copies(i.e. the Pergamon Athena, the Louvre copy, and the Varvakeios statue can't convey the feeling of the original for two reasons: The difference of the material and the difference in scale. The original was polished ivory and gold and 12 meters high. This scaling down presented the copyists with a lot of problems in the detailing of the statues they produced. The Amazonomachy depicted on the outside of the shield is often ommited or reduced, the Nike statue is almost always missing - or in the case of the Varvakeion just a few centimetres high, and the griffins and sphinxes of her helmet are greatly simplified. The small number of copies is also telling. Lesser known statues have survived in greater numbers.  As for Phideias' style, it's true that he didn't direct every carving of the Parthenon, but even the worst work on the pediments or the frieze (the metopes are certainly a mixed bag) surpasses the quality of the best Parthenos copy."
ArtefactPorn,351qto,LucretiusCarus,1 point,Wed May 6 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"There isn't really much in the way of evidence that Phidias directed the Parthenon carvings at all--in fact given the fairly wide variety of apparent carving hands that seems pretty unlikely. In fact the idea he was is something of a retrojection of Renaissance conceptions of the role of the artist on the ancient world (as well as an example of fitting the role to the name, which is a bit of a no-no in ancient studies). Really the frieze and metopes are barely mentioned in ancient sources anyway.  I agree that the copies lose the scale and, thus, a lot of the effect of the Athena statue (which is why the Nashville Parthenon is so cool), but when you talk about the ""grandeur and mobility"" it just seemed like you were making a different set of aesthetic judgments, and one that runs the risk of Athens worshiping, which is still unfortunately common in classical studies."
ArtefactPorn,351qto,Tiako,1 point,Wed May 6 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"It's certain though that there was a central planner  for the whole sculptural program. Plutarch attributes that role to Phidias (though the word he used, episkopos, could be interpreted in a lot of ways) and there seems to be an underlying theme behind the themes of the  frieze, pediments and metopes, even though it was a huge collaborative project.  The mobility is a mistake of my fat fingers on my tiny phone. Should have been nobility, as attested by the sources. And it's really not Athens worshiping but just an observation. The copies have the cold quality and (sometimes poor execution) of the roman workshops, sometimes simplifying or modifying the original for their own aesthetic ideal. To get back at your original point, the Parthenon statue might have been admired but certainly not copied enough, at least in sciulpture (there are a few magnificent coins and engraved gems). From the Phedeian works the Promachos was a lot more popular - together with the Amazon he is attributed to him."
ArtefactPorn,351qto,LucretiusCarus,1 point,Wed May 6 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Going from the very vague phrase ""πάντων ἐπίσκοπος"" to assuming that Phidias had a direct hand in the Parthenon friezes and metopes isn't really a supportable leap, particularly given that close analysis of them reveal a wide variety of competences. Furthermore, the specific passage in Plutarch makes it clear that he is the ""ἐπίσκοπος"" of Pericples' work in general rather than the Parthenon in specific. It is Callicrates and Ictinus that are directly associated with the Parthenon.   The copies have the cold quality and (sometimes poor execution) of the roman workshops, sometimes simplifying or modifying the original for their own aesthetic ideal.   This is exactly the sort of aesthetic judgement that scholarship has finally been moving away from. It's meaningless, and reveals nothing except the current aesthetic fashion among whoever is doing the judgement. The idea of the ""cold Roman"" and ""vital Greek"" is one that has its origins in nineteenth century Romanticism and probably should have stayed there. Particularly in this case, where the original is gone and our only way of reconstructing it is from a passage of Pausanias and these very copies that are assumed on no basis to be lacking a nobility and vitality of the original.   To get back at your original point, the Parthenon statue might have been admired but certainly not copied enough   I'm not entirely certain what you mean here? It was certainly not the most popular copied work but it was copied, particularly in figurenes, coins, etc."

ArtefactPorn,34zgpn,LucretiusCarus,105,Tue May 5 21:03:39 2015 UTC,"Placed against the back wall of her looted tomb it's one of the few surviving representations of ancient thrones, complete with a marble ottoman. The marble plaque on the seat is the lid of the urn that rested on it and it's now overturned just outside the frame.   The armrests and back are supported by sphinxes and dancing female figures. On the back there is one of the few surviving classical paintings, depicting Pluto and Persephone, the lords of the underworld, on a quadriga. Almost every detail of the throne, from the floral decorations to the frieze of griffins and lions is painted with bright colors and liberally gilded.  The back wall of the tomb, in the form of a facade, gives a very good idea of the original use of color by the ancient Greeks. Never turning into gaudy, it accents specific details, giving a restrained lively rythm.    The tomb was looted in antiquity, but the thieves didn't really prosper - for long. Two skeletons found inside the tomb are probably the losing side of an argument that broke over the sharing of the loot."

ArtefactPorn,34zgpn,dethb0y,1 point,Wed May 6 11:08:11 2015 UTC,"These are indeed the original colors. Keep in mind though that the exposure to the elements (bright sun, rain and snow) of greece would mute them, as you correctly state, over time. Even statues that were buried shortly after their creation (as the Acropolis peploforos display these faint colors."
ArtefactPorn,34zgpn,dodgyville,1 point,Wed May 6 11:32:07 2015 UTC,"The colors have been degraded in bits of it, the back in particular is darkened, but yeah. There are traces of paint on lots of things that can be analyzed for color like in the example you posted, but reproductions like that one are more ""colorization by someone who can't paint"" than ""painting"". Doing it digitally also makes a big difference because bucket filling a shape is usually very different than actually painting, plus saturation variation problems that just look unnatural (because they are). And some colorists have interpreted ""bright"" as ""neon"", which I'm not really down with.  This is not Greek at all, but it gives a more accurate impression of what I think is meant by ""bright colors"" also this fresco"

I honestly think we've spent so much time with some structures specifically as ruins, why not try to restore them?  I'm sure there's some sort of lengthy argument on both sides, but I think it'd be nice to bring some of these things back."
ArtefactPorn,34xdlz,MongoAbides,7,Tue May 5 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"You can restore the structure, but at that point, why put it directly on top of it? It's no longer the original structure, you can just put it anywhere. Which they do all the time. In the case of the Parthenon, though, since its spot is so relevant, they actually shape the restored stone to be the exact fill of the ruin, making sure none of the information of the damage is lost."
ArtefactPorn,34xdlz,Syn7axError,3,Tue May 5 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah but, is that pile of rocks really the original structure either?  Ultimately these are things that broke, and no one was there to fix them at the time.  Now we just leave these things broken because that's how we found them."
ArtefactPorn,34xdlz,MongoAbides,1 point,Wed May 6 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the principles of formal archaeology, but I'd say it's not done primarily because it would be a huge risk to the artifact and there'd really be nothing to gain. I guess I see what you're saying but you can't ""bring the artifact back,"" that's the artifact, it's there if you look close enough. If someone wanted to rebuild a monument then they can rebuild it somewhere else with no risk, but if you try to rebuild/reconstruct/repair an existing monument then it's a huge risk and you'd just be covering up parts of the actual artifact with a reconstruction.      I'm sure that someone has tried to repair an ancient monument with bad results, but the only major monument repair that I know of is Newgrange in Ireland and it was in a state of disrepair at the time so many specialists didn't even agree on some of the specifics from my understanding. That was a mound which was repaired in the 1970s I believe so they were probably careful, and people had been using stones from it for various things over the centuries so they probably did the best they could but there are still probably people who didn't agree with some of the restorations."
ArtefactPorn,34xdlz,Masahide,1 point,Tue May 5 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"there'd really be nothing to gain   I don't know if I agree though.  I think there's a real value in being able to experience things ""as they were meant to be"" or simply ""how they would have seen it.""  Especially if we're just leaving a decaying pile of rocks why not just restore the monument to former glory because the old rocks have no value either?  I think we've gotten about as much out of these corpses as we can, in many cases.  Especially something as old as Rome.    You're not likely to get everyone to agree, which is totally understandable.  Some materials might not even exist anymore, like certain varieties of marble. I think the good faith effort, and being able to use/experience history as close to originally intended as possible might be interesting enough."

Where augmented reality would shine would be a place like london....you crawl up an observation tower, or to a platform on a building and BAMM!! here is what we think roman london looked like....oh here it is as a walled city....oh and here what the wall itself looked like.

ArtefactPorn,34pl3v,tennessee_hilltrash,11,Mon May 4 08:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ancient Greeks liked things a bit gaudy. Look online for reconstructions of Greek temples for examples of how colorful they used to be."
ArtefactPorn,34pl3v,GreenAbbot,11,Sun May 3 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a lot of the temples would not have been quite as gaudy as the reconstructions would seem to make them appear at first glance.  The Utraviolet light and companion techniques  used on Greek statues only allows us to see the ""primer"" if you will.  Likely there would have been more finished details on top of the primer that would somewhat reduce the gaudiness.  (here's an example for those who have not seen the reconstructed colours).  The reason we can't really say more that ""likely"" is because since any layer above the ""primer"" has been permanently lost, there is no way to reconstruct it.  Since any guess would be without evidence, the reconstructions usually don't go any further than what we can determine about the ""primer.""  How much added detail, if any, was there?  The guesses range from some to none, but we can at least say the ancient Greeks really liked their bright colours!"
ArtefactPorn,34pl3v,SoapBoxOne,14,Sun May 3 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"Isn't it also safe to assume that in a world before cheap ubiquitous pigments the colorful pastels wouldn't be seen as gaudy? With displays of bright stunning colors less commonplace, these patterns would be seen as rare and dazzling. Or maybe I'm totally wrong I don't know."
ArtefactPorn,34pl3v,Always_posts_serious,3,Sun May 3 15:46:35 2015 UTC,"You would be correct. It's been a few years since I studied this, but in the ancient world they had to collect different herbs and inks to create different colored dyes and paints and it could be quite expensive and troublesome.   IIRC in the age of the ancient Phoenicians , the color violet, or ""royal purple"" was impossible for anyone to buy except for rulers because of the rarity of the sea life whose ink was used to create the color.  It was seen as an amazing display and a rarity at the time.   The world certainly wasn't as saturated with colors back then, so what we see as gaudy now was beautiful at the time."
ArtefactPorn,34pl3v,GreenAbbot,2,Sun May 3 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"To a certain extent, it is certainly uncontroversial to state that ancient cultures often had different tastes to our own, and like today, what one person finds beautiful another may perceive as hideous.  Another thing to consider is that the Patron who commissioned the art in question often, in the words of John Hammond, ""spared no expense.""  The paint job would be the last thing one would skimp on - so barring laws against the use of certain pigments, the most expensive would tend to be showcased on sculptures meant to appear as a 'statement' of the owner's prestige, wealth, etc.  Though, if we want to get a good idea of what the final paint artistry on Roman and Greek sculpture would have looked like, we likely do not have to look much further than the mosaics they were paired with.  (Here are a few examples )  As you can see even from the brief selection given above, the mosaics tend to have quite a bit greater colour diversity and detail than the ""primer paint"" reconstructions.  But you are correct that the vibrant reds, yellows, and blues would have been seen as ""rare and dazzling"" but they (once again qualifying with the word likely) would have been tempered by artistic detailing.  But even with mosaics, we are still skipping over another piece of evidence:  Roman Mural painting.  Thanks primarily to their preservation at Pompeii, and to a lesser extent elsewhere, we have a pretty good idea of the attention to detail that high quality roman painters put into their work.  We have even found bowls still containing the powdered pigments used.  So the best guess is that the detailing on statues would be similar to that found on the murals and mosaics.  We even have a mural depicting a painted statue (From the Temple of Isis in Pompeii).  Now, with all of that being said, the ""gaudy"" reconstructions are much closer to what the Romans and Greeks would have been used to seeing compared to the bare statues we are used to seeing in museums.  While we can't say for sure how much refined detail was added on top of the ""primers,"" it is not unreasonable to assume that the level of detail would be similar to that found in Mosaics and Murals."

ArtefactPorn,34mu7d,TotallyOffTopic_,10,Sat May 2 18:11:35 2015 UTC,"Errgg.. goes and googles   In May, scientists immersed the Hunley in a caustic chemical solution of sodium hydroxide that will extract the salt that seeped into the hull over the years. That process could take five to seven years, and can't be completely effective until the concretion is removed.  Scientists had hoped the chemicals would loosen up that concretion, make it a little easier to move. And it has helped, they say, but it's not like it's falling off.    Okay, so my understanding is they are keeping it in the tank to slowly let the salt extract safely without reacting further on the hull. So the picture and title is correct in that the submarine is slowly releasing that accumulation. However if it were exposed to air with that salt, it would destroy the hull. So the picture is of the slow release."

So my question is how did Hunley sank the first vessel if its not by a torpedo?"
ArtefactPorn,34mt8e,innuendoPL,19,Sat May 2 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"So, a little more on the nature of these places (there are a number throughout Peru): each layer (it's hypothesized) would have contained a different type of topsoil, and be planted with a variety of crops. Under each layer of topsoil were several additional layers of soil, with a layer of gravel at the bottom. Finally, at the bottom of each tier was a culvert/outlet that would allow water draining from the upper layers to irrigate those below. The water sources were usually rivulets of condensation from cloud forests or snowmelt, diverted along stone channels to irrigate the facility.   The purpose of this was twofold. (Again, this is a hypothesis as the Incas built all their works without using a written language, instead using knotted strings carried by specialized couriers--all we have are Spanish accounts.) First, the Incas had a very high-altitude civilization. Second, their empire covered a great many latitudes, from Ecuador to Chile. While crops move very efficiently along an East/West axis, changes in climate and rain patterns along a North/South axis make it harder for plants to propagate in those directions. (This is why we have ""belts"" of various plants.) In addition, altitude changes screw up crops, so they'd need to try the same crop at different altitudes throughout their empire.  TL;DR the Incas built these agricultural stations throughout their empire to see what would grow at various altitudes and latitudes, and built everything from this to Macchu Picchu without writing a word."
ArtefactPorn,34mt8e,Anacoenosis,1 point,Sat May 2 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"I think there is some controversy over the actual time period of a lot of the pre-inca architecture. It's clear the Inca's built the sloppy stone work that is pictured in this post and Machu Picchu also has the sloppy stuff built on top of the Pre Inca. Historians claim that it's all relatively dated around the 1500s, which is likely true for the Inca stuff, but the really fascinating megalithic stuff that is in and around cuzco, machu picchu, and Tiwanaku could go back a very long way and if Tiwanaku goes back to the first century the megalithic stuff around peru and chili likely dates around the same time, if not older.  Sorry to go off subject here, but I've always been facinated by the preinca. I've visited peru and really love the place. However, I don't think the Inca really did anything interesting. I think it was the societies before them that really understood something amazing we can't even comprehend today and their understanding of building and who knows what else could have withstood quite a lot and could be much older than the archaeological community would be willing to admit.

Maybe we have to see them kinda like some of todays sled dogs that are kept and fed at certain periods of the year and at others they are left alone and made to fend for themselves.

ArtefactPorn,34dmty,sua_mae,9,Thu Apr 30 08:22:55 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I have some questions:   Was it common for kings like Alphonse X to have multiple arms? What would be the circumstances?  Why don't we see more purple like Henry De Lacey?  What on earth is that thing on Johan Hastings's shield?
ArtefactPorn,34dmty,ArMcK,9,Thu Apr 30 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"This is known as marshalling. It's rare in early heraldry but extremely common in later heraldry. Normally you only inherit arms from your father, but if your mother has no brothers to pass on the family arms, then you'll inherit her arms as well. Thus you display both arms on one quartered shield. I'm not entirely sure. Purple definitely exists in heraldry, but it's always been one of the rarer colours. Perhaps because purple dye was difficult to obtain? That's a maunch. It represents a medieval woman's sleeve; this kind of thing."

ArtefactPorn,349hjq,tighttummies,185,Wed Apr 29 11:00:31 2015 UTC,"Back in 1750 B.C. in the Middle Bronze Age, a copper merchant named Nanni sent a stone tablet to Ea-nasir regarding the delivery of the wrong grade of copper ore after a gulf voyage of his agent through enemy territory to collect it.  Back then to send a letter you had to first find a scribe to write your text in cuneiform onto a moist lump of clay, fire it carefully in an oven, and finally get a courier to deliver personally the fragile tablet.  After it took hours just to make,  Nanni’s still had to be delivered across enemy territory.   The letter reads as follows:  When you came, you said to me as follows: ""I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots."" You left then, but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: ""If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!""  What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory.  Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Samas.  How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.  Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt."

My first year archaeology lecturer many years ago spoke of his time  analysing  Mt Sandal in N Ireland. Most artifacts were found in holes in a ground and up to that point people had assumed that this was because people 10,000 years ago had lived in said holes. He was the first to point out that of course they hadn't lived in holes in the ground. The reason artifacts were found there was that the trees that the neolithic people had planted to protect their warm and comfy homes created root hollows and when the trees died the household goods were washed into the hollows by the rain over the years.

For more obscure history, like prehistoric Ireland, it would be mostly artistic license.  Not that I think it's a bad idea, it could be used as a less serious educational tool. It had the same problem as us trying to really guess how dinosaurs looked like. Did they have feathers? What was their skin color or pattern like?

Nature will do it, but it will take a long long time."
ArtefactPorn,345psu,theguyreddithates,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"No attempt at actual reforestation. We've lost a lot of our original species, elms etc. There is a lot of forestry, but only really commercial. This about heavily forested does not apply to Aran though, nor to most of Connaught. As said previously, it's really too windy. The landscape is famous karst. See articles on The Burren."

ArtefactPorn,345q95,SwissPatriotRG,3,Tue Apr 28 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think it was to create a shorter rifle with a decently long barrel.  It is a mid step between a conventional rifle layout like an AR-15 and a bullpup design like a steyr aug. The magazine on the side gives room to move the handle forward on the gun, so the overall length is shorter than a rifle with the same barrel length."

ArtefactPorn,345q95,MedicaeVal,1 point,Fri May 1 15:01:14 2015 UTC,Its easier to feed the next round from the side. When firearms tech moved forward the less obtrusive bottom feed was developed.

ArtefactPorn,345q95,con_le_sarde,-1,Tue Apr 28 23:22:07 2015 UTC,That's absolutely not true at all. If that were the case then this build would still be in use. In all practicality having a heavy weight torquing the rifle to the left severely effects aiming.
ArtefactPorn,345q95,MedicaeVal,1 point,Fri May 1 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. Why would this still be in use? It widens your profile and that of the rifle.

So I googled it.   This curved sword bears the cuneiform inscription ""Palace of Adad-nirari, king of the universe, son of Arik-den-ili, king of Assyria, son of Enlil-nirari, king of Assyria,"" indicating that it was the property of the Middle Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (r. 1307–1275 B.C.). The inscription appears in three places on the sword: on both sides of the blade and along its (noncutting) edge. Also on both sides of the blade is an engraving of an antelope reclining on some sort of platform.  Curved swords appear frequently in Mesopotamian art as symbols of authority, often in the hands of gods and kings. It is therefore likely that this sword was used by Adad-nirari, not necessarily in battle, but in ceremonies as an emblem of his royal power.

ArtefactPorn,341uak,birdinspace,11,Mon Apr 27 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"The khopesh was originally a Caanan sword, but the Egyptians adopted it after seeing how badly the Canaanites were beating them with it. They were among the first purpose-made sword designs, evolved from farming sickles, so you can understand why they look so strange. It's also thought that they evolved from axes. I can see why many would think that, but I prefer to think they they simply incorporated the concept of the axe instead.  Compared to later swords from the iron age that were usually straight or only slightly curved, sickle swords and other forward-swept swords (they curve forward instead of backwards) are perfectly suited to just cutting and chopping, cutting especially if the blade also also curves back as well as being forward-swept, like on the khopesh.  These kinds swords lasted a long time, well into the iron age. The khopesh stayed around for well over 1000 years before it was made obsolete by constantly improving tactics, armour and weapons. The khopesh itself was gone shortly before the iron age started though.  Compared to the Iron Age, Bronze Age swords were very common since they were far easier to make and maintain. This meant that more infantrymen could have them as secondary weapons (they usually used spears or pikes as their primary) or even as their primary for some units. Since armour wasn't really a thing, at least not in North Africa, choppings swords kicked so much ass it was amazing. The khopesh is one of the most underappreciated swords I know of that was extremely effective."
ArtefactPorn,341uak,airborneleaf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"I only have cursory knowledge, but many khopesh had extreme curves that resulted in a hooked tip, which made the weapon extremely effective when combined with its simple axe-like use."
ArtefactPorn,341uak,Twitch_Half,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on this, but I know that some curved swords were made to be used on horseback because when you hit someone you don't get a hard shock upon impact like you would with a straight sword. In a related sense, but not just for someone on horseback, a curved sword has a longer cutting surface than a similar sized straight sword, so when you hit someone the sword will kind of roll off of them as you're swinging it. These were the principles behind the katana from my understanding."

ArtefactPorn,33xc1s,segolas,13,Sun Apr 26 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Having read up on this, I don't believe this is Ogham, but rather a simple cipher. First you'll want to look at the article this photo was taken from here. Note that the ""kiss me"" cipher was actually decoded much earlier and is written is ""Ice runes"". (iss runes, simply the letter i equivalent in runes)  I hate to reference Wikipedia, but this page talks about the fact that the runic alphabet is divided into groups (ætt). From reading up on Nordby's work, it seems this is what the shorter of the dashes represents. The longer of the iss runes indicates the rune within that group. In the photograph example it would be: 3rd ætt/6th letter, 2nd ætt/6th letter, 2nd ætt/5th letter, 1st ætt/4th letter, 3rd ætt/6th letter. (Note that the short dashes alternate top to bottom, and the ones at the bottom are quite faint.)  Anyway, nowadays this research seems to mostly be done by Jonas Nordby, who took this photograph, and he has a selection of papers here, if you would like some further reading."

ArtefactPorn,33xc1s,ThirdLetterWords,13,Mon Apr 27 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"I found this post interesting so I read most of the wikipedia page on Ogham ""(pronounced with a silent “gh”; alternately spelled ogam] apparently Ogham is technically the name of the script itself (which was created in Ireland) so it's not a specific language or whatnot and there are many variations in how it's written. None of the examples I found matched the character style here, almost all of the examples I saw had what are called stemlines; many Ogham inscriptions are found on posts or standing stones, the edge of a post/stone is usually the stemline for these. Some characters/""letters"" will be cut from this edge/stemline to the left while others will be cut from the stemline to the right, and some characters will be cut from one side of this line to the other so if it were inscribed on a post it would begin on one side and end on the other. Later inscriptions, which are known as scholastic Ogham, will have stemlines cut into a face of a stone instead of being cut into an edge/corner.      Many experts believe that Ogham was created as a cryptic, or coded, language but there is no real consensus on this, and some experts also believe that it was originally created after a system of hand signals. The characters are vertical scratches, but some are longer than others and each grouping of scratches has a different number of scratches in it. Since there appears to be five groupings of characters on the wood in the picture, the first character could be K, the second I, the third SS, and the fourth and fifth could be ME but that's just a guess.       Ogham’s “letters” are lines chiseled into stone posts, as can be seen in pictures of Ogham stones in this essay.  The vertical lines in the graphic to the left represent the edge of the stone post (the stemline). To illustrate:  An Ogham “B” is a single line chiseled into the stone post to the right of the stone post’s edge.  A “Q” is five chiseled lines to the left of the stone post’s edge.  The Ogham “G” would be two diagonal lines across the edge of the post. Note how pre-historic this most unusual alphabet looks on an actual stone from County Monaghan shown in the graphic on the facing page.  But Ogham is not from the Stone Age, but a Christian era creation.      Strictly speaking, the word ogham refers only to the form of letters or script, while the letters themselves are known collectively as the Beith-luis-nin after the letter names of the first letters (in the same manner as the modern ""Alphabet"" deriving from the Greek Alpha and Beta). The fact that the order of the letters is in fact BLFSN led the scholar Macalister to propose that the letter order was originally BLNFS. This was to fit into his own theories which linked the Beith-luis-nin to a form of the Greek alphabet current in Northern Italy in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. However, there is no evidence for Macalister's theories and they have since been discounted by later scholars. There are in fact other explanations for the name Beith-luis-nin. One explanation is that the word nin which literally means 'a forked branch' was also regularly used to mean a written letter in general. Beith-luis-nin could therefore mean simply 'Beith-luis letters'. The other explanation is that Beith-luis-nin is a convenient contraction of the first five letters thus: Beith-LVS-nin.[18]       ^ http://www.irish-society.org/home/hedgemaster-archives-2/places-artifacts/the-ogham-alphabet   The ogham alphabet originally consisted of twenty distinct characters (feda), arranged in four series aicmí (plural of aicme ""family""; compare aett). Each aicme was named after its first character (Aicme Beithe, Aicme hÚatha, Aicme Muine, Aicme Ailme, ""the B Group"", ""the H Group"", ""the M Group"", ""the A Group""). Five additional letters were later introduced (mainly in the manuscript tradition), the so-called forfeda.      The Ogam Tract also gives a variety of some 100 variant or secret modes of writing ogham (92 in the Book of Ballymote), for example the ""shield ogham"" (ogam airenach, nr. 73). Even the Younger Futhark are introduced as a kind of ""Viking ogham"" (nrs. 91, 92).      The four primary aicmí are, with their transcriptions in manuscript tradition and their names according to manuscript tradition in normalised Old Irish, followed by their Primitive Irish sound values, and their presumed original name in Primitive Irish in cases where the name's etymology is known: The twenty standard letters of the Ogham alphabet and the five forfeda.

ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,innuendoPL,7,Sun Apr 26 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"that's slick as shit, right there. Must have been very efficient use of the leather."
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,dethb0y,2,Sun Apr 26 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome find!  I'm curious, how does leather not disintegrate after such a long time, especially given that it's a biological substance?  Is it a chemical used in the processing of it?"
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,GreyscaleCheese,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"The only way possible is due to it being from an oxygen free environment I.e. water logged-clay, permafrost or bogland (aso extreme dryness but that isn't an option in the UK). Perishable things like wood and leather will simply not survive for a fraction of that time in any other way, especially in normal soil conditions.  That's why bog bodies are so incredibly well preserved."
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,xpol_3,0,Tue Apr 28 02:06:50 2015 UTC,"Not an expert, but the reason leather lasts has to do with how it is made. When they made leather in ancient times, they'd scrape off the fatty bits first, and often the outer grain of the skin. Then they'd wash it. Different cultures had different techniques, but using urine was common, and the ammonia in the urine killed microbes that would otherwise have started the decomposition. Rubbing fat or a slurry of brains would soften the leather and then stretching it as it dried would soften it further. And then smoking it completes the drying process, as well as adding antimicrobial qualities from the smoke. Basically, kill as many germs on it as possible first, and then drying it well, helps to keep it from breaking down. We do it a little differently today, but the basic premise is the same   Of course, leather left in the damp for a long time isn't necessarily going to remain unscathed forever. I wonder what happened to this shoe's mate?"
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,BecauseCaveCrickets2,2,Mon Apr 27 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting points.  I bet that would help definitely, but what about the microbes in the soil?"
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,GreyscaleCheese,2,Mon Apr 27 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"I guess the curing process would make it more resistant to the microbes in the soil. It would also depend a lot on the conditions of where it was. Like how well the soil in that area drained (so less standing water) and what sorts of microbes were present, etc. Even in a compost heap, it would take a long time for leather to break down (granted, not 2000 years, and you shouldn't put leather in a compost heap anyway). That's why leather from so long ago can still be found, but still very rarely. All the conditions had to be right."
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,BecauseCaveCrickets2,2,Mon Apr 27 12:11:43 2015 UTC,Where do people find this stuff? Can someone who works in the field enlighten me on how stuff like this goes undiscovered in major urban areas for thousands of years? Is it unearthed during construction?
ArtefactPorn,33xcbn,Stadtmitte,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:26:10 2015 UTC,Probably. Often there are regulations that require construction workers to stop work for a certain number of hours or days and notify authorities and archeologists if cultural artifacts of antiquity are found. Then a university team will often come in for a few days and do a salvage operation of some kind.   I'm a california architect and we were required to have archeological reports prepared for some high end residential homes planned near the coast. We had to add verbage on our plans to explain what to do if artifacts are found. Have been a member of both AIA's... the Archeological Institute of America and the American Institute of Architects.

ArtefactPorn,33whn0,comosayllama,8,Sun Apr 26 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"(BS in CS here, 20+ year programmer) - I think it's valid to call this is an ancestor of today's computers because:   We can legitimately consider the Abacus, and the Bombe as ancestors to computers too. The immediate predecessor to electronic computers were sprocket-based computers (i.e. Turing's working at Bletchley park breaking Enigma) The discs & mechanisms are obviously complex enough to store a rudimentary program, although it is not a generalized computing device. It's easy to see how the automaton, the bombe, the pre-electronic Bletchley park computer, and the difference/analytical engine are all in a similar family. As a term 'ancestor' doesn't have to mean 'has all the same traits as' anyway. It just means it used technologies that had relation to what was developed later."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,hotfuzz86,2,Sun Apr 26 18:08:09 2015 UTC,This was able to be programmed as well -- it accepted a pre-defined set of characters that allowed it to write custom messages. See ~3:00 on this video: http://www.chonday.com/Videos/the-writer-automaton
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,comosayllama,3,Mon Apr 27 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"Having watched that now, I'd have to say it definitely is an ancestor. The writing boy automata was a pinnacle of engineering amongst automata and a path that clockwork development took as it was miniaturized. Clockwork led into computing without any doubt. In addition, the cams driving the letters and the way it can be reprogrammed - really is pretty impressive. You can pretty much see the line from gears to cams to sprockets to electronic computers.  The really neat thing about the discs in the writer automata are that they aren't digital but analog. The level of cut on the discs is akin to the groove on a record, (i.e a number within a large range rather than true/false) which gives the writer such smooth actions."

Think of it like this: what better way to show Human dominance over the elements and environment than to create ""life"" that was nearly indistinguishable from that which ""God"" created?

ArtefactPorn,33whn0,30cuts,20,Sun Apr 26 09:52:07 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a program, a computer does nothing. And the Jacquard Loom is considered an ancestor of of modern computers. Up until the 80's punch cards were still used to feed information into computers. And that only changed because of the development of optical readers. So today we have Scantron style cards instead of punch cards, but work in the same way."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,dougbtv,12,Sun Apr 26 10:35:58 2015 UTC,"To me, automaton are naturally spiritual ancestors to modern computing -- as a whole. We've made a machine do something repetitively mostly all by itself. The concept is there.  And as almost everything in art and technology: someone remixes a few ideas, and it stacks. So for example, you take someone's thinking about loom, a la Jacquard (circa 1801), and then say you take another need like tabulating the census -- and you get in the late 1880's early 1890's Hollerith's tabulating machine; which leads to IBM (who definitely has an impact on modern computing)  But what inspired Jacquard, or the machines that lead up to that point? I'd guess all kind of mill technology -- which was totally using the hottest thing ever to transfer power from the shift -- the cam! (which appears in western civ around 14th century). Look at how far they came in 400 years, from a mechanism that could turn your grain mill into a hammer mill -- to basically a straight up mini robot. So amazing.  So maybe not EXACTLY a match to a computer. But, conceptually, quite a beautiful series of technology that's coming together over time.  Edit: Agreed with the technical assessment, so I changed my wording to ""spiritual precursor"". More of spiritual precursors more than 1-to-1 ancestors. However, I still assert that it's a long and variable chain of technology coming together before there is a turing complete electronic computer."

ArtefactPorn,33whn0,fusiformgyrus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. Previous comments somehow assume that having a program means it's a computer. There is no computation going on in these machines. There is one input and one output that are always pre-determined.   One may call them a computer, but that's definitely a far cry from our modern computers, let alone being Turing-complete. Babbage's difference engine can be considered as one of the ancestors of modern computing."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,fusiformgyrus,0,Sun Apr 26 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be a mistake to call these automatons ancestors of modern computing as there is literally not a single computation going on. These machines produce always the same output and do not even have inputs. Computation, by definition, requires both of those and an operation that relates inputs to outputs.  At the best case we can call these ancestors to modern robotics but nothing more."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,30cuts,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be a mistake to call these automatons ancestors of modern computing as there is literally not a single computation going on.    An analog clock doesn't compute anything either, and yet it can tell you the date, time and even show you the orbits of the planets. Internally it may not be the same as a modern digital watch but it performs similar functions and so can be considered an ancestor.    These machines produce always the same output and do not even have inputs.    The Writer shown in the video can be reprogrammed to write almost any short text via moving, removing and replacing the parts in his back. He was built in a way specifically so that this could be done. He was intended to have way to input a new program.   At the best case we can call these ancestors to modern robotics but nothing more.   But a modern robot probably has even LESS in common with The Writer automaton. Most modern robots don't use any clockwork whatsoever, there's no attempt to make them human shaped. If you were to make a toy like The Writer today, it would have a computer for sure, but very little in the way of real robotics."

This is absolutely a fully functional computer that contains all of the concepts that today's computer would possess. Only instead of using a program language, the machine's physical components would act as part of the program, as you stated.    Literally, if somebody wanted to, they could write a program that could identify every mechanical part of this doll and translate each of them into a statement that would follow it precisely (With the aid of 3-D technology to render the doll's physical motions).    Either way, this machine truly is a fascinating marvel."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,FUZxxl,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"The key concepts that differentiate a computer from any other device are these I would say:   the existence of a program that is changeable that operates on user-supplied data that can change it's course of execution based on the data it operates on   In the aforementioned apparatus, we have element (1), and maybe element (2) but nos. (3) and (4) are absent. One could say it's a program-controlled device but the fact that it doesn't operate on data makes me unsure about whether it's really a precursor."
ArtefactPorn,33whn0,joeangler,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:08:33 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the interchangeable characters that the machine uses to write the characters on the paper be considered data though?

ArtefactPorn,33t9ab,haberdasherhero,5,Sat Apr 25 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"For a traveling monk or priestly scholar then most definitely.  Normally you would have to go to a church to find a requisite bible to preform an important daily function or as a part of religious study but this solves this problem so he could do his work on the go or even in isolation in nature as some monks attempted.  Remember that the Gutenburg Bible had only been around since the 1450s.  Bibles were not common, they were expensive works copied by scribes just before this and the Gutenburg printing press alleviated this problem a bit.  It was likely what lead to this invention, just like micro-processing and automated manufacturing improvements lead directly to the cellphone in everyone's pocket today.  And just like cellphones nobles would use it as a status symbol to show off both their wealth and spiritual/intellectual status, but there are many who would have had a utilitarian need for strapping a rugged tome with them on the go."

I suggested that it could partially be because mobile phones weren't seen as a cool consumer gadgets the way we see our smartphones today. At that time, young people weren't as hyperconnected as they are today, so mobile phones where first and foremost seen as professional tools. They were high tech, but not sexy high tech that every other teen wanted.  I hope this comment conveys my thought more clearly. If not, that's alright, it really wasn't important."

The talisman had two large cabochon sapphires. One was oval and the other was square. They were set into a remnant of the wood from the Holy Cross (the Cross of Jesus) and a small piece of the Virgin's hair. It was to make their love constant. It must have worked, since he never stopped loving her. This talisman was buried with him at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 814, and re-discovered when the tomb was opened by Otto III in 1000. The talisman was then preserved in the treasury of the Cathedral until it was given, by the canons, to Empress Josephine in 1804, to wear at her coronation.      Each side of the crown was set with a great cabochon [a polished gem that is not cut into facets] sapphire in a foliated [leaf-like] colate [compared in detial to] that rose from the rim of gold. The crown had lots of embossed [a raised design or relief] work and coarse filigree [ornamental openwork of fine wire] with settings of garnets, carbuncles, emeralds, and pearls.       http://www.studentsocculthistory.com/talisman-of-charlemagne.html"

ArtefactPorn,33tba8,Solifluktion,3,Sat Apr 25 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"They blew some of them up but it was very expensive and removing the rubble took a long time.  For example: The removal of the ""Leitturm"" on Heiligengeistfeld in Hamburg in 1974 costed 3,000,000 DM (2 DM = 1€ = ~1$ in 1999) and took 14 months.

ArtefactPorn,33tba8,BetaKeyTakeaway,2,Sun Apr 26 00:16:21 2015 UTC,This is the Flakturm at Augarten. A bit of history about what happened after the war:  1945 the Russians tried to blow this tower up but only parts of the ground-floor were demolished.  On the 21st of November 1946 a couple of teenagers lit a fire inside the tower to create some light. The fire got out of control and reached the Flak-amunition which exploded (two wagon loads). It caused considerable damage to the levels 7 through (possibly) 12.
ArtefactPorn,33tba8,BetaKeyTakeaway,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:23:45 2015 UTC,Why was there still Flak ammunition in the tower? If it was in active use how did a couple of teenagers manage to sneak in and lit a fire without being discovered?
ArtefactPorn,33tba8,submarshal,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:27:36 2015 UTC,"The ammunition rooms of Flak towers of Type I and II are in the basement. Type III Flak towers, like this one at Augarten, have their ammunition rooms at the very top floor so the Russians didn't remove the ammunition before trying to blow the tower up.  Once the basement was damaged the elevators used to transport ammunition up and down weren't functional anymore.  The flak tower was in the part of Vienna was under Soviet control from 1945 to 1955 and probably wasn't guarded at all or not very well."

ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,squashedbananas,24,Fri Apr 24 13:45:05 2015 UTC,underpants were considered a symbol of male dominance and power.   wow
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,HellonStilts,13,Fri Apr 24 14:14:07 2015 UTC,High heels were also men's wear initially. Being taller was more important for dudes back then.
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,blackadder1132,4,Fri Apr 24 17:07:58 2015 UTC,keeping the mud off of your shoes when you stopped your horse to take a leak was good too.
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,HellonStilts,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:23:38 2015 UTC,How would heels keep your shoes unmudded though? Surely the toes would still get dirty.
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,blackadder1132,15,Fri Apr 24 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"because the toes were high too but fashion moved and the front part got shorter, then people stoped wearing them on muddy streets and started wearing them on ballrooms, fashion moved and now both sexes wore them, the fashion moved and now only women wore them.....fashion moved again and now you have people claming that men designed them so women could not run...or be free, of course not...you forgot your horse!"
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,HellonStilts,2,Fri Apr 24 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I hadn't actually seen those! I've only seen the ones worn by 17th century nobility, I'm guessing it evolved from something functional to a status symbol like most things do."
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,lisasimpsonfan,5,Fri Apr 24 19:08:56 2015 UTC,It was also a sign of wealth.  The higher the heel the less practical the shoe and the less physical work the owner could do.  If you heel is so high that you can barely make it across the room it's doubtful that the owner does much but sit on their butt all day.

ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,quantumchaos,9,Fri Apr 24 23:52:31 2015 UTC,considering the decay of the garment what is to say there wasn't bras of some sort much earlier in history and none survived?  there's only so many freak accidents in the world to preserve older items from natural decay.
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,blackadder1132,17,Fri Apr 24 17:16:02 2015 UTC,Its highly likely
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,chocolatepot,5,Fri Apr 24 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"I came across this post yesterday but didn't get the chance to weigh in at the time. Being in the fashion history field, I took in a lot of different opinions on the ""Lengeborg bra"" back when it was discovered, and there were a few things I wanted to clarify (for anyone who backreads here, I guess).   It looks more like a bra than it originally did because the bottom has disintegrated and this image has cropped off the form below the bust. There is actually a piece with eyelets running down the side, the only remnant of the bottom of the ""bra"" - it was more like a shaped, non-stretchy tank top. Here's a picture that shows it. Sorry, the parts that are gone are very likely from natural decay rather than sex. This isn't as earth-shattering as the newspaper articles would make it out to be. People who study and reconstruct medieval dress have known about ""breast bags"" for years - here are some quotes and sources. Most evidence points to breast bags and other binding methods being practiced by women with large busts rather than all women as a matter of habit (as today), which makes it not exactly like a modern bra in practice. This wasn't decorated with lace, as any lace from the 15th century was needle lace/reticella cutwork and so mind-blowingly expensive that it would not be on a hidden undergarment lace can't even be documented until around 1500, and it was incredibly uncommon until the end of that century, when it became merely horrendously expensive."

ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,PhillipTheGirlNickel,0,Fri Apr 24 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"It looks like the top of a chemise, a garment that would have been worn under a corset. I would be greatly surprised if this was actually a stand alone garment as we see bras today. If you look at the tattering across the bottom it looks as if material had been torn off versus just the garment falling apart. If the seams along the top looked as tattered as the bottom I would be more willing to accept that the garment was a bra when it most likely was a chemise or something similar."
ArtefactPorn,33p6zx,paisleyjuice,4,Fri Apr 24 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"It's got shaped and seperate cups intended to support the breasts, which differentiates it from chemises of the same era, which also tended to have sleeves."

And also very cool.  If you're ever back in the area I definitely recommend the Museo Larco Herrera in Lima and the Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipán near Chiclayo. Some of the most impressive things you will ever see in a museum. I hope you got to the site museum at Huaca de la Luna, though. It has a lot of great stuff too. It only opened about five years ago, though, so if you were there sooner then you missed it."

I did go to the museum at Huaca de la Luna (it was brand new), and the most frustrating thing for me was the fact that there was a ""no photos"" policy, but then no gift shop or any way to buy like a book or something about the collection.  I'll be back in Lima in June, so I'll put the Larco Herrera on my itinerary.  Thanks for the tip!"

ArtefactPorn,33kzmu,Moosekababs,2,Thu Apr 23 22:01:41 2015 UTC,Fossilized is kind of the wrong word.  As anything over 10000 years old is considered a fossil regardless of whether it's been mineralized.

ArtefactPorn,33kzmu,lisa3535,10,Fri Apr 24 01:25:21 2015 UTC,"It is an easy calculation. A century lasts 100 years, it begins on year 1 and ends on year 100. The first century Anno Domini (after Christ) then began on the year 1 and ended in 100AD. The second began in 101AD and ended in 200AD, and so on and so forth. The 9th century goes from 801 to 900. For instance, the great Viking invasion of England - called the ""Great Heathen Army"" - happened in 865, thus on the second half of the 9th Century.  We are currently on the 21st Century - which goes from 2001 to 2100 - in the year 2015. How long ago was that invasion? Just subtract the year from the current: 2015 - 865 = 1150.  Now, the Christian calendar which we use count the years before the birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as years ""Before Christ"", or ""BC"". The 9th Century BC was almost 3000 years ago, so that might be the source of your confusion."

ArtefactPorn,33kzmu,Rootner,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:50:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for that!  How do we count the years BC?
ArtefactPorn,33kzmu,lisa3535,2,Fri Apr 24 11:23:55 2015 UTC,"Same thing but in reverse. Before the year 1AD is the year 1BC, and then you count backwards. The First Century BC begins in the year 100BC and ends in the year 1BC. For exemple, the Gallic Wars - the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar - happened from 58BC to 50BC, the first half of the First Century Before Christ. Alexander The Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire in 334BC, in the second half of the Fourth Century Before Christ, 276 years before the Gallic Wars.  How long ago was that? You do the same thing as before, but treat the years BC as negative numbers. So (2015)-(-334). Subtracting a negative number is like adding a positive one, so 2015+334=2349. The invasion of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great started 2349 years ago. The conquest of Gaul began 2073 years ago and ended 2065 years ago.  The years are like a number line, but without the zero. There is no year zero.  Another notation, more used by modern historian, is the ""Common Era"". ""BC"" is then called ""BCE"", ""Before Common Era"", and ""AD"" is called ""CE"", ""Common Era"". For instance, the Trojan War is believed to have happened in the 12th or 13th Century BCE, over 3100 years ago."

I won't say how, but I got a first-hand, behind-the-scenes tour of the conservation facility in eastern North Carolina when I was in the area for vacation about 7 years ago, and got to see a number of cannon, glassware items, and even what is believed to be Blackbeard's toilet in their unconserved state.

ArtefactPorn,33gp3o,SassyMoron,15,Wed Apr 22 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"You also strike bells for certain hours (noon is eight bells, for instance).   The ship's bell plays a large ceremonial role, too. When certain ranks come aboard, you strike a certain number of bells to let everyone know.  Babies are also traditionally baptised in a ship's bell. The names of thsoe baptised can be seen engraved on the inside of the bell.  The ship's cook is also in charge of keeping the bell polished and in working order."

ArtefactPorn,33gp3o,demontits,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellfounding    Bell metal Main article: Bell metal  Functional bells, for the intention of producing sound, are usually made by casting bell metal, an alloy of bronze. Much experimentation with composition has existed throughout history; the bells of Henry II had nearly twice as much copper as tin, while much earlier Assyrian bronze bells had ten times the amount of copper to tin.[10] The recognized best composition for bell metal though is a ratio of approximately 80 per cent copper and 20 per cent tin.[11] Bell metal of these ratios has been used for more than 3,000 years, and is known for its resonance and ""attractive sound"".[12] Both tin and copper are relatively soft metals that will deform on striking. By alloying the two elements a harder and more rigid metal is created but also one with more elasticity than the use of one of the metals alone.[12] This allows for a better bell resonance and causes the bell to ""vibrate like a spring when struck"", a necessary quality as the clapper may strike the bell at speeds of up to 600 miles per hour. The forces holding the tin and copper together cause vibrations rather than cracks when the bell is struck which creates a resonant tone.[12] This metal combination also results in a tough, long-wearing material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina on the surface of the bell which coats it against further oxidation.[8] (emphasis added)"

The reality is they lived in one of the most diverse ethnobotanical paradises on earth and all the Mayans knowledge about entheogens has since been lost or is only held by a very, very small group of descendants. I'm probably wrong for assuming an ayahuasca blend would be their main entheogen of choice (they almost undoubtedly had knowledge of how to make different brews). I recall reading something that some suggest the mushies were reserved to the higher class for ritualistic reasons and not so much for the rest of the citizens. Entheogens were no doubt a huge part of their culture. The cane toad was common through the area and therefore the extract (bufonin (sp?)) may have been the most widely used. No one knows, really."

So in as much as the art of this vessel being very typical Mayan style, it was probably most influenced by mushrooms."

Set along the famous Watling Street leading from the Thames to northern England, Verulamium was one of the largest and most important cities in Roman Britain. Its pre-conquest history is a bit opaque, with a significant Cautuvellani center that is a bit difficult to define. After the invasion a large Roman fort was built at the site, and the surrounding civilian settlement was granted Latin Rights and eventually turned into a major town. It is probably most famous as one of the cities destroyed by Boudicca during her war against Rome early in its history, but archaeologically it is significant as one of the best excavated and understood cities in Britain.  Today there is a rather pleasant little town there."

The Roman boat found in 1910 during the excavations for the concrete raft on which County Hall is built, excited much interest. Parts of the timbers were destroyed before their presence was recognized, but what was left of the boat was carefully lifted, treated with preservative and deposited in the London Museum. At the time she was thought to have been a Roman galley, and from the evidence of three coins found in her was dated at about the year A.D. 300. One theory was that she went down in a fight between Allectus and Constantius in the year A.D. 296, and the large round stone embedded in her timbers, which might have been ammunition thrown from a Roman ballista, lent colour to this assumption. (fn. 145)  More recently experts in nautical research have considered that her timbers were too lightly jointed for a sea-going vessel and that it was unlikely that she ever possessed a mast. It seems probable that she was a ferry boat plying across the river and that she became derelict in her old age or was sunk by accident. There was a large hole in her bottom and she may have met her end by drifting on to her mooring post in a high tide. This type of vessel would have been much shallower in draft than a galley and much shorter in proportion to her width. She could have been propelled by one man rowing her standing as is still done on vessels of this type. If, as is suggested on p. I, a Roman road from Canterbury crossed the river to Westminster from a point between Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, then this may have been one of the boats employed at the crossing; this is, however, conjecture. Her timbers had been repaired in a number of places, showing that she was an old boat when she met her end. A varied collection of pottery and other objects were found in and around her, most of which have been preserved.   From: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol23/pp62-65"

The medium 12pdrs cannon was adopted for use by the horse artillery in 1792 (modelled on the Prussian practice). The artillery introduced the 9pdr cannons into service c.1809 and these fought alongside the 12pdrs. The 9pdr cannon was heavier and less manoeuvrable than the 6pdr and required more horses to draw it but offered stronger firepower. My guess is that this was probably caused by a 3pdr cannon ball."

Keep in mind, swords were essentially sidearms meant for close quarters fighting usually worn by those with spears or some other kind of longer range weapon. Edit: It's been pointed out to me that I have some inaccuracies in my comment (as I said, casual at best). See the comments below. And see this video for how I got my information"
ArtefactPorn,33061z,Grabbioli,7,Sat Apr 18 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"Continental swords (and Viking swords, actually) at this time would have been largely derived from the spatha, which was the primary sword used by the soldiers of the late Roman Empire. As you can see the hilt gave hand protection, and while not as elaborate as a later crossguard I'm not entirely certain there would be much practical difference.  It's worth noting that your image of Roman infantry formation is a bit mixed up. The sword used as just a ""side arm"" was actually a characteristic of Greek hoplite warfare, and one of the key innovations of the Roman army was the use of the sword as the primary weapon, essentially marrying Samnite and Gallic styles of warfare to strict Greek formation. The Roman soldier would also carry two javelins to hurl at the enemy before charging, but the sword was still the primary weapon.  Of course this is the order of battle for the early Roman army. The soldiers of the late Roman army used a longer sword (the spatha) and small darts (plumbata)."
ArtefactPorn,33061z,Tiako,3,Sat Apr 18 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"I did some Google-fu and am not sure if this is accurate for European swords in general, or just certain parts, or if it's really true.  This is super interesting and talks about different kinds of sword, but the types are defined by blade and pommel.  This is a Viking sword from the 9th century that shows the narrow gladius-style guard you mentioned.  Here is a section of a book talking about Roland and Charlemagne (Roland died in 778) and there is a photo of a sword with a longer cross guard.  But go up a few pages and there is a drawing of a stone tablet that shows a short hilt.  Anyways, if you like Vikings, swords, and especially Viking swords, you gotta watch this video, Secrets of The Viking Sword."

ArtefactPorn,32tclb,Respectfullyyours,5,Thu Apr 16 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"This artifact is currently at the British Museum and their website talks about it in a little more detail -    This mosaic is believed to represent the god Tezcatlipoca, or ‘Smoking Mirror’, one of four powerful creator deities, who were amongst the most important gods in the Mexica pantheon. The name ‘Smoking Mirror’ derives from the Nahuatl (Mexica) word tezapoctli, meaning ‘shining smoke’ and representations of Tezcatlipoca are typically characterised by distinctive black stripes on the face and a smoking mirror generally displayed in his headdress, at his temple or in place of a torn-off foot.  The base for the mosaic is a human skull. The skull is cut away at the back and lined with deer skin on which the movable jaw is hinged. Long deerskin straps would have allowed the skull to be worn as part of priestly regalia. Skull ornaments like this are depicted in the Mixtec Zouche Nuttal codex.  The turquoise, lignite, pyrite and shell were all procured from the farthest reaches of the Mexica empire and beyond. The effort made in assembling this diverse selection of exotic materials emphasises the divine ‘other-worldly’ nature both of the mosaic and whoever wore or displayed it."

One group sees one as gods and the other as demons. And so they end doing the opposite of things that the other group believes in. I know very little on this subject because my Professor of Asian Religion spoke about this briefly.   But, basically names are interchangeable and aspects of good and bad in the ancient religions meant very different things than how we see them as. The gods could be incredibly cruel or don't care about humanity, but nature beings or those of the elements may however lend humans a hand or protection."

ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,krnxkin,8,Tue Apr 14 01:43:44 2015 UTC,Interestingly enough it's mostly likely nearly the same round.
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,TheBloodening,9,Tue Apr 14 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"It is. Pretty much all the rifles used in WW2 used nearly identical rounds in power and size. These British rounds are .303s (7.7x56mm), the German is likely 7.92x57mm or maybe Austrian 8x56mm although that is less likely. Just a few tenths of a milimeter difference."
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,Kvaedi,2,Tue Apr 14 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about guns, but does this mean the German bullets would work in British rifles?"
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,geobloke,21,Tue Apr 14 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"No, it likely wouldn't chamber (load) at all. If you were unfortunate and it did, the firing pin would likely pierce the primer (rather than simply striking it to set it off), due to the german round having a larger length. This would cause the gas produced by the burning gunpowder to take the path of least resistance. Normally this would be to push the bullet out and propel it through the barrel. Instead the path of least resistance would be backwards, through the hole the firing pin made. If you're lucky, the gun is simply rendered inoperable. More likely it's just turned into a grenade nestled right up to your face, possibly setting off the other rounds in the magazine as well. Further the German round is too wide for the Enfield's barrel, so even if it didn't blow up or simply fail to chamber, the bullet would get stuck in the barrel on your first shot making it impossible to shoot more (or if you made the very unwise decision to fire anyway, it'd split the barrel, your hands won't get away from that unharmed)  So tl;dr no that wouldn't work (and trying to force it to would be a very very bad idea)  There is an example from WW2 that did work like that however, the Finnish and Russian Mosin Nagant rifles. The Finnish rifles were purchased from Russia prior to the war and modified in Finland to fire the Finnish 7.62x53 round, as opposed to the Russian 7.62x54 round. The Finnish Mosins could safely chamber and fire the Russian 7.62x54 round, although it increased wear, so this was only done if there was no other option. The Russians however could not fire the Finnish ammo with their rifles."
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,Kvaedi,5,Tue Apr 14 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. It's kinda what I thought would happen, though I kinda hoped that the small differences wouldn't be enough to cause such a catastrophic failure. I guess I just really like the idea of using the enemies weapons against them"
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,geobloke,5,Tue Apr 14 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"I just really like the idea of using the enemies weapons against them   That actually happened quite a lot, they'd use the rifle of the enemy though. There were lots of Russian weapons put into service with with the German military, as well as the other way around.  In his book ""Tigers in the Mud"" Otto Carius (A german Tiger commander) details multiple cases of this, one incident a stockpile of machineguns and other supplies was captured, because it was guarded by under-equipped fresh recruits. They had to fire on a lot of people wearing German uniforms and using German weapons as a result, because all the Russians in the area were now using them, leading to some friendly casualties. Tanks were also captured and used by both sides, which was pretty dangerous for the tank crews, especially at night (particularly in the early war Russian tanks that lacked radios) because it was incredibly difficult to identify the tank as friendly. Imagine you spend weeks, months, years eventually later in the war instantly recognizing a model of tank as an enemy and immediately firing on it, or else it will do the same and possibly destroy you. ""It might be a captured tank"" probably wasn't the first thought on anybody's mind.  Another example is the German Gewehr 43 and Russian SVT 40. Both were captured and put into use frequently because both Germany and Russia lacked sufficient numbers of semi-automatic rifles (the only army to issue them on a massive scale was the US, with the M1 garand). They held a massive advantage over the general issue bolt action rifles of both countries and were too valuable not to use."
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,Kvaedi,5,Tue Apr 14 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"The British Sten submachine gun used 9mm for just this reason. It could use the standard 9mm German pistol round. It could also use the more powerful 9mm German submachine gun round (black painted bullet), but the British 9mm round would not  be powerful enough to use in the German submachine gun. According to Popular Mechanics anyway."
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,WonderWheeler,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:03:10 2015 UTC,"It's plausible, if your charge doesn't put out enough force to eject the last cartridge and load a new one, then an automatic gun needing manual operation is useless."
ArtefactPorn,32gtm4,melez,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:11:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely plausible.  Guns ""cycle"" by using the hot gases and recoil energy of the round currently being fired.  You will run into this problem with modern day handguns if they have a very heavy slide and you're using ammunition with a relatively weak powder charge.  If the recoil energy can't knock the slide back far enough, then it won't properly chamber the next round or reset the hammer/firing pin.  So yes even if the ammo is the same size, the amount of gunpowder in the round will make a difference.  It's not a COMMON problem, but it can happen."

ArtefactPorn,32hpmb,Narwhal_Jesus,14,Mon Apr 13 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"This massive sculpture represents the Aztec (or Mexica) earth goddess Tlaltecuhtli, a duality goddess who both gave birth (note her posture) but also devoured (she is depicted drinking the blood that soaks into the ground). It was found in the centre of Mexico City, which also used to be the political and religious centre of the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan.  One of the interesting things about sculptures of Tlaltecuhtli is that they were typically meant to be placed face down, in contact with the earth and hidden from view. Aztec stonemasons, tasked by the conquering Spaniards to tear down their temples and use the stones for their new houses, palaces, and churches, made sure to set Tlaltecuhtli-bearing stones as the bases of pillars and foundation stones, ensuring that even with their temples destroyed their godess would still be in contact with the earth, as their religion dictated."

ArtefactPorn,32fud5,innuendoPL,16,Mon Apr 13 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"Possibly stupid question, but Viking history isn't something I know too much about. Is there a specific reason or number of reasons that it's next-to-impossible to find a complete helmet?"
ArtefactPorn,32fud5,that_fools_a_creeper,29,Mon Apr 13 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"Mostly because it's over a thousand years ago and iron rust. There have been found many helm fragments, just not much in such good conditions."
ArtefactPorn,32fud5,L0rka,17,Mon Apr 13 15:49:06 2015 UTC,Iron can also be heated and reforged and once these kinds of helmets had degraded and were no longer militarily useful they became other things.

ArtefactPorn,32fud5,SpinningHead,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"Helmets were melted down and rarely burried in graves. To compare, Very few helmets were found anywhere in Europe from the same period."
ArtefactPorn,32fud5,ui20,17,Wed Apr 29 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"This is actually my specialty.  We find hundreds of small iron bits - crampons, arrowheads, spearheads, bridles, fire steels, neck rings, shield bosses, amulets, etc...that are equally as corrodable as maille, lamellar, or helmets would have been, but we find none of them in the 1000+ graves excavated at Birka. If it were a common practice, something would have survived. A helmet isn't going to corrode away faster than a shield boss or a sword.  My theories on what the plausible reasons for not burying someone with a armor:  1) Armor was a form of personal property. Some things were part of an ""estate"" that you would leave to your heirs after death and other objects were personal property that you kept and were buried with you. Coins, for instance, were rarely found in burials, and then only in small quantity. They were considered part of your family's property.  2) Armor was too expensive to bury. This doesn't actually seem plausible to me. A suit of maille was certainly an expensive bit of kit, but so were horses, slaves, boats, swords, jewelry, silks, tapestry, etc...  3) Something cultural caused them to think that armor was not something that you should bury/burn with people. Maybe someone in the afterlife needn't be concerned with being injured. They did bury people with shields. Perhaps a shield is seen as more of an ""active"" defense that is somehow more necessary in the afterlife."
ArtefactPorn,32fud5,umlaut,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Number 1 is supported by saga evidence (for whatever that's worth). Several descriptions of inheritance of armor and weapons are found.  Yes, boats and such were expensive. Maille was even more expensive. It was not at all a common item. The vast majority of Norsemen didn't own armor at all. A shield was the only protection that most fighting men had.  Don't forget the ""reforged into other things"" possibility. When raiding is over, what do you do with that helmet? Keep it around, or turn it into something useful?"

ArtefactPorn,32cm2i,boxingnun,5,Sun Apr 12 21:45:42 2015 UTC,I don't believe this type of decoration has as much of an impact on breakage as you claim.   I believe you are correct. The inlay (silver?) on this isn't too deep (so it wouldn't affect the structural integrity enough to leave it useless) and doesn't extend to include the edge.  Meaning the edge was left bare so it could be sharpened and used.  More likely this was the axe of a very important person or their close relative.
ArtefactPorn,32cm2i,Worsaae,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that the axe was ever intended to be used in battle. An axe of this quality would be immensely valueable, and would you risk damaging or destroying one of your most valueable possessions? Like, you wouldn't do a demolition derby in your brand new Lamboghini."
ArtefactPorn,32cm2i,boxingnun,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:36:46 2015 UTC,Depends on the possession.  Some things are just made to be used no matter how valuable.  It is my opinion that this axe was originally designed to be used because of the material choice for the main body and the fact that the ornamentation doesn't extend to the edge unlike many ceremonial weapons.  The edge could be hardened and sharpened without damaging the inlay.  If this were purely ceremonial then why would it be made like this?  Of course this is just my opinion based on what I can observe.  I fully admit I could be wrong.
ArtefactPorn,32cm2i,iirainey,2,Sun Apr 12 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"One of the Viking Sagas spoke briefly about a decorated axe. In Egil's Saga, Egil was sent an axe with gold inlay in the blade from Eric Bloodaxe. Egil decided to test the axe by decapitating two oxen. The axe shatterd when the blade hit the stone under the neck of the second ox, Egil hid the axe and did not tell Eric.  Even though the sagas are debated as reliable historical sources, I believe they are useful for finding out about material knowledge and I thought it was relevant to the discussion.  Also, I would like to mention that it would be nearly impossible to tell if the mammen axe was used because most of the original iron edge has worn away."

ArtefactPorn,32cm2i,EnIdiot,19,Sun Apr 12 23:08:22 2015 UTC,"I like the sentiment, but the reality was much harsher in some instances and more banal in others. Slavery was very common. It you weren't on the in with the chief and the group and couldn't muster up the ability to fight every last bad-ass off, you'd likely be sold into slavery for cash. Secondly, Vikings were basically a bunch of merchant marines with long periods of just shipping crap from one place to another. Sure, if you needed to raise cash for a venture, you might raid a monastery here or there, but basically your main job was to trade or to go slaving (hence the Slavic people's name).  They were boat builders and farmers and other things as well, and yes, they were better fed and had better general health than other Europeans of the same age. The fallacy of the popular view of these guys is that they were a bunch of crazy ""metal-heads"" who just had fun and partied all the time. They worked really hard, prepared for their business really hard, and had a workman-like attitude towards trading and slaving. They could be brutal and elegant, cowardly and brave,  and basically like all the other people in that time, they did what they did to survive."

ArtefactPorn,329aji,angrydroid,7,Sat Apr 11 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yes 2 stacked loads, and if all is well the front powder charge ends up in line with the front charging pan, the front firing first obviously, leaving the rear charge for a second shot.

ArtefactPorn,329aji,deadhour,5,Sun Apr 12 15:04:53 2015 UTC,"I assume that he wasn't talking about hitting the target, he was talking about misfiring.  Having two charges go off in the same barrel is risky and it only works if the front one goes off without firing the rear one.  The only thing is, I don't see how that would happen.  If the first charge ignites, it would also ignite the second charge unless there was something separating the two of them.  There's a bullet there, sure, but it does not fully seal the tube.  Weird to think about.  It's a mystery to me."

Pure speculation but I would guess a tight fitting wad would be specified between the loads, but even so, fuck holding that thing if it has a double load in it.  The gunsmith would have to specify exactly what amount of powder, what size wad etc to use or the front charge won't line up. It looks to be quite a small calibre by the standard of the day, probably deliberately. I would guess it's an gunsmith's display piece or a commission. Pretty nice engineering for 1610."

This Nabataean caravan-city has been inhabited since prehistory, and was an extremely important crossroads between Syria-Phoenicia, Egypt, and Arabia. Petra’s temples, dwellings, and monuments were for hundreds of years the centre of a splendid civilization. Surrounded by mountains, the city is half-built, half-carved into the rock. Certainly one of the most famous archaeological sites of the world, here ancient Eastern traditions blend with Hellenistic architecture. The Theatre of Petra is carved at the foot of the High Place of Sacrifice during the reign of King Aretas IV (4 BC-AD 27). Seven stairways ascend the auditorium, and it consists of three rows of seats, which have been separated by passageways. The Theatre is able to accommodate about 4000 spectators. It has undergone several successive alterations and enlargements, the Romans, for example, rebuilt the back wall and stage. This would have been a hugely important building for the city, as it was likely used for both public meetings and plays. The back and stage were once richly decorated with columns, as well as imported marble statues in the Roman period."

ArtefactPorn,328rao,dr_kingschultz,8,Sat Apr 11 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Compared to other weapons, not many. Maybe even none. An antique spearhead is far more likely to have seen combat than a sword did, because swords were not common on battlefields after the Bronze Age. If they were carried into battle, they were primarily sidearms."
ArtefactPorn,328rao,airborneleaf,2,Sat Apr 11 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"What, really? I find it hard to believe swords weren't often used on battle fields. I could be deceived by a lifetime of consuming fiction though. Could you link something that supports the inferiority of a sword?"
ArtefactPorn,328rao,manyfingers,18,Sat Apr 11 17:52:39 2015 UTC,"They were far more common in the Bronze Age, because they were cheaper and easier to make, maintain and replace. Iron and steel swords are far more difficult since they needed to be forged, whereas bronze is cast. If and when a bronze sword is bent out of shape, all you need to do is hammer it back and there will be no real permanent structural damage to the blade. A steel sword tends to chip and snap, both of which require grinding, heating and a lot of skill, and you have to take material off the blade to make the edge smooth again.  When it comes to use on the battlefield, spears are pretty much superior in every way. They have far more reach, in a way are faster, and can still attack in a variety of ways. They're also very cheap to make and replace. In the Bronze Age, swords were pretty short because bronze is pretty soft. A bronze sword the length and shape of a later steel sword would be far too easy to damage. Their size also helps the cost of making them and the fact that they didn't get in the way when you were fighting with your shield and pike or spear.  When steel came about, they could finally make the blades longer, making them more effective. This also made them harder to carry around along with your spear, shield, food, blankets, clothes etc. If they would have been issued to infantry, they would have just been another thing to carry around and get in the way. It's the same reason most countries don't issue pistols to their infantry. For the weight and cost of a pistol and a few magazines for it, you could just carry a few more magazines for your rifle. If you lost your spear, your primary weapon, it was time to leave because you would be dead before you could draw a sword.  You could say the Romans used swords as standard, but their economy was a powerhouse and their resources vast. Their resources and battlefield tactics allowed the sword to work in that role. Other than that, swords were only ever issued to officers and light cavalry because they weren't expected to fight in formation against formations.  I can't really think of anything specific to link to, but there are plenty of things you can find just by Googling how swords were used or something like that."

Almost never army vs army in open country."

There also has been no real in depth analysis of decorative items or features made of these figures beyond grouping them into stylistic categories.

I wouldn't say it's like civ at all. It's closer to crusader kings 2 just on a much smaller level. You control up to 3 characters at a time, in real time,  and you run a business or do what ever you have to do to get rich so you can take out your competitors and have a successful dynasty."

ArtefactPorn,31qn1o,fwinzor,6,Tue Apr 7 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"More like a mix of: - Assassin's creed for the level of detail - GTA for the variety of the experience - Uncharted for the beautiful scenarios - The Sims for the level of house customization - Skyrim for the quest-like mechanics      I don't know how to explain it, it should just have the best trait of every videogame of these.     For example Assassin's Creed has a great level of detail and I love the fact that you get to meet historical figures, but I hate the repetitive mechanics.     Uncharted has immersive levels, but you are limited to those levels and it's too linear.     And so on.     I want a sort of 'Sherlock Holmes' game, but with good mechanics, customization, a sort of 'Roman Life simulator', but entertaining. I hope it makes sense, I'm not really good at explaining myself. I just want to chill out, go out for a walk in the city, travel across different cities, spend roman money for roman food, and so on."

Eventually they had the dwarves make them a magical ribbon called Gleipnir. It appeared to be only a silken ribbon but was made of six wondrous ingredients: the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, bear's sinews (meaning nerves, sensibility), fish's breath and bird's spittle. The creation of Gleipnir is said to be the reason why none of the above exist. Fenrir sensed the gods' deceit and refused to be bound with it unless one of them put his hand in the wolf's mouth.  Tyr, known for his great wisdom and courage, agreed, and the other gods bound the wolf. After Fenrir had been bound by the gods, he struggled to try to break the rope. Fenrir could not break the ribbon and enraged, bit Tyr's right hand off. When the gods saw that Fenrir was bound they all rejoiced, except Tyr. Fenrir will remain bound until the day of Ragnarök. As a result of this deed, Tyr is called the ""Leavings of the Wolf""; which is to be understood as a poetic kenning for glory. During the battle at Ragnarök, Fenrir swallows Odin whole."

ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,Default_blah,16,Sun Apr 5 11:55:14 2015 UTC,I'm actually studying a lot of Anglo Saxon runic writing at the moment (spoliers; a lot is gibberish or so obtuse it's useless).  That ring is one of the more well known examples of runic writing that people think is in relation to magic. There's also the chance that the people making the ring just thought that those particular letters looked nice. There's no clear cut way of telling how literate the general population was in runic writing so sometimes you can look at a piece and the most likely conclusion is that it's more aesthetic than literal.  I can give an alphabetic translation of the inscription from a book I've got once I get home but it really is a mess.
ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,Sparrowhawk42,11,Sun Apr 5 12:14:05 2015 UTC,Yes and no. It's like looking at a sheet of Japanese script then recreating the symbols you liked the most to use as a poster. Craftsmen could have seen similarly inscribed pieces of jewelry or whatever and simply copied the nicer looking runes for their own use.
ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,sanman3,6,Sun Apr 5 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"While the runes can certainly be used as a system of writing, this was not always their purpose. While the prevailing historical view is that the runes were the adaption of the Roman roman characters into a form that could be etched into wood and stone, many believe the system (at least partially) existed before this supposed interaction with the roman system. Thus, many believe the symbols had a more iconographic function prior to their use in a writing system adapted from Roman techniques. We are trying to read the runes to spell words, but each rune has an associated meaning alone that can be interpreted by those that surround them. This is what is being employed in the divination technique known as runecasting. Furthermore, each rune has associated ""magical"" properties that are being addressed (sort of) in some of the other comments. Ultimately, I think it is unfair to just write it off as random magical nonsense of a people who were arbitrarily etching them onto things decoratively.  I could try and describe the story being told. But I could not do so from the standpoint of scholarly historic accuracy /r/artefactporn is likely seeking. For more in the vein of shamanic rune use I would suggest /r/Norse or /r/pagan.   I hope I am not approaching this from a direction unwelcome on this sub. I was just trying to present an alternative to the ""magical gibberish"" conclusion. It is certainly ""magical,"" but with a deeply considered intention."

ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,Aerandir,2,Sun Apr 5 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"I hope I am not approaching this from a direction unwelcome on this sub.   when you have a highly upvoted comment saying these letters spell out something from Lord of the Rings, believe me, your actual attempt to answer a serious question about the artifact posted is nowhere near going in the wrong direction"
ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"That's nonsense, the 'runology' branch was made up in the 19th century. Runes were not glyphs, and the examples we have from actual archaeology are analogous to the Christian 'chi-rho' symbolism; it's not the letter itself that is magical. Similarly, the 'names' of the runic letters were also made up afterwards, similar to how we have names for letters in NATO phonetic alphabet (Hotel, India, Lima, Tango etc.)"

This means that it was probably somebody important that commissioned it, and you'd have to think that if anybody understood any of the runic writing, it would be the important people.   I could see more common folk doing as you say, or things similar to easterners getting chinese tattoos, in order to look more important, or something like that.

Since we don't know what that meaning is, it's a bit of a leap to dismiss it as ""magical.""   For all we know, it could be a cypher key."

ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,fabiolanzoni,4,Sun Apr 5 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"True, there is no certainty without more information. We'll never know without time travel what the exact meaning or importance of the runes on this ring are. However, as /u/blackadder1132 pointed out, part of the inscription is listed elsewhere as a spell to stop bleeding. It's not simply random gibberish being dismissed as magical there's at least some evidence that leads to the conclusion.  It could be part of a cypher like you suggested, but not much writing was done in this time period, so I doubt it. That doesn't rule it out of course, pretty much anything is possible. Could be some guy named his pet with a really long and crazy name and eventually got it on his ring for all we know."

ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,frankwilliam,2,Mon Apr 6 08:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, it depends on the exact find circumstances here. If the place you are searching is a ploughed field, it is better to find it and make it public, but if the artefact is from a known archaeological protected site, or from an undisturbed burial ground, it is better to leave artefacts safely in the ground so that they might be found by people in the future, hopefully with better technology and better documentation abilities than people today. In any case it is extremely important to let people know where exactly you found the artefact. This ring for example, without knowing exactly where and how it was from we have no way of knowing whether it is from the 5th century, the 11th, or just a modern reproduction/hoax."
ArtefactPorn,31ic2p,Turtletree,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"An astounding amount of information about an artifact comes from an actual archaeologist pulling that artifact from the spot it was buried in. Should that artifact never be given that care from the very start, immense amounts of information (when that artifact was used, by whom and what for) becomes irreversibly lost. So, SO much of what we know about history comes from these sorts of archaeological digs.  ""Just keeping it"" is literally the destruction of history itself. Worse, that artifacts value plummets to becoming almost worthless. You might as well melt it down, because the majority of high end collectors won't buy from you because you can not produce a provenance for that artifact....a provenance that would have been established if you'd only allowed that Archaeologist to do their job."

If I were to spend a considerable amount of money to have a list of names and arms produced, I would hire someone to do it. Even such vivid and quality colored inks would have cost a considerable amount. It would make sense to get the best available artist to produce the list. As for more difficult materials to work with, sure maybe, but those would be the materials such an artist would be used to working with. Familiarity with the materials should not effect quality of workmanship.   This does not just apply to this roll either. Many and most works from this period have a similar childish quality to them. I'm not hating on it. I'm just curious how mankind accepted such poor workmanship in something like this but also designed and built massive stone structures. It's just odd."

His mother was Joan of Kent, a male-line granddaughter of Edward I, and later married to Edward the Black Prince of Wales - Thomas Holland Earl of Kent was the product of her previous marriage, making Thomas a half-brother to Richard II.  I suppose because his half-brother was king, Thomas was granted permission to use these arms instead of his own father's.  Perhaps Joan of Kent was even jockeying to put Thomas into contention for the throne; Richard II was usurped by a cousin, Henry IV, so Thomas' claim to the throne was just as valid.  Having the Plantagenet arms would have made his position seem more powerful."

Description:  Canoes in the western Solomon Islands were essential to transportation, fishing, and warfare. In former times, they were lavishly adorned. The centerpiece of the prow was a distinctive figurehead, known variously as a nguzu nguzu, musu musu, or toto isu. Attached at the waterline so that it dipped in the sea as the canoe rode the waves, the figurehead reportedly served as a supernatural protector, ensuring safe passage and a successful expedition. The images are typically busts depicted with large heads wearing circular ear ornaments and small arms with the hands raised to the chin or clasping a head or bird. The jutting jaws of the images were reportedly attributes of spirits, and nguzu nguzu are sometimes said to depict, or afford protection from, dangerous sea spirits called kesoko."

ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,TallBastaard,5,Wed Apr 1 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"The definition ""warrior society"" can be clumsy at times. Was 18th century Europe a ""warrior society"" because kings liked to be portrayed on top of horses in uniforms and/or armor? I think many social structures and culture of the ""Vendel era"" was very similar to the same to ditto in the ""Viking Era"", but do keep in mind that the region developed at a rather steady pace, and from a Scandinavian point of view, the definition ""viking age"" is a bit arbitrary.  The way I was schooled, the Viking Age was just a part of the ""late Scandinavian iron age"" which roughly coincided with the early middle ages to about 1000-1100 A.D., at which point the middle ages are said to have begun in Scandinavia."

ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,OnkelMickwald,-9,Tue Mar 31 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion  The size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 equites (drawn from the wealthier classes - in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the republican period of Rome, (the infantry were split into 10 cohorts each of four maniples of 120 legionaries), to 5,200 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men)."

ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,Kvaedi,-6,Wed Apr 1 05:42:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter where the helmet is from, I was merely referring to the fact that it must have been hell to produce something like that in those ages, especially on mass scale.      Try ordering something like this today, and it'll cost you an arm and a leg, yet we have museums in every city that contains some extraordinary piece of art.   I don't understand why everyone has to be such a smart-ass and try to disprove me on voicing a question."
ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,secretgspot,4,Wed Apr 1 06:07:15 2015 UTC,"You didn't ask a question though, you stated pretty much every soldier would have something like this. Then you started talking about empires that were on the other end of the continent and dead for centuries prior.  The reason people are disagreeing with you is simply because you're wrong. Yes, an emperor could afford something like this for his guard, and the rich Roman Empire could afford to equip men with armor-they did not pay for their own gear, and it would not be decorated like this at all. Prior to the Marian reforms, in the Roman Republic, not Empire, men would pay for their own gear, and only wealthy landowners could afford arms and armor, the average citizen would be a skirmisher without armor, helmet, even shield.  Now back to the time period and location this helmet was from: wealthy noblemen could afford something like this. There wasn't an average soldier in Scandinavia, as they didn't have standing armies. The average person couldn't afford something like this at all."
ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,Kvaedi,17,Wed Apr 1 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's false. Most people in the vendel period wouldn't even have helmets. And most with helmets would be simpler, like this  http://royalathena.com/media/Medieval/HMS25.jpg"
ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,BeastofWotan,-13,Tue Mar 31 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"How come we're finding so many of them?

ArtefactPorn,30xvsu,ztara,5,Tue Mar 31 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"Not really I'm afraid. A trained professional warrior may have owned a helmet, which at any level would be massively expensive. You have to remember metal  was not an abundant material and that every gram had a high worth. Such a level of craftsmanship (ie. the overlaid detailing) would be a luxury cut above that. The closest comparable helmet I can think of is the infamous Sutton Hop helmet from the UK. Made roughly in the same period with face plate and panel detailing. This was the helmet of one of the most powerful men in the country, most likely Raedwald, Bretwalda of England and was going in a boat burial and surrounded by world class grave goods. Not a common helmet by any means."

This piece also dates to the 7th century a few hundred years after Roman dominance over Europe.

ArtefactPorn,30wrp3,hpliferaft,15,Tue Mar 31 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"It's very interesting from a historical perspective because of what it's trying to say about Diocletian and his co-emperors. Basically, from Augustus onwards, the Roman Empire never had an official line of succession, as bizarre as that seems to us. Especially in the 3rd century, the fact that the Empire didn't have a normal way for power to pass from one emperor to the next caused a tremendous amount of bloodshed and uncertainty. So, when Diocletian took the purple, he had the idea to divide up the Empire between four people: two co-emperors, called the ""Augusti,"" and two junior co-Emperors, called the ""Caesares."" Basically, each Augustus grooms a Caesar to assume full power.   In theory, everything is great: the empire gets two emperors who can command on the two dangerous borders at the same time, and neither emperor is stepping on each others' toes, so they don't have an incentive to go to war. The Augusti have lawful successors, so that takes a lot of the guesswork out of things, and the Caesars have no incentive to rebel against their seniors because they know they'll get power eventually anyway.   This system is called ""The Tetrarchy"" (rule of four), and the statue is trying to portray this ""new era in Roman government"" by showing the Augusti and Caesares being brotherly. Actually, things went to shit pretty quickly, but it's the thought that counts."
ArtefactPorn,30wrp3,12_Years_A_Slav,2,Tue Mar 31 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Well, the fourth crusade was a big deal when it happened and is a good illustration of the great schism between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. It also helped to seal the fate of the Byzantine Empire's downfall. Constantinople, once a shining beacon of civilization and a bulwark against the advances of outsiders into Europe, would never recover. A mere few hundred years later she would fall to muslim invaders and give rise to the Ottoman Empire. The world might very well be a different place today if Byzantium endured."

It was made in Spain circa 1750-1760 Sculpture, and is made of polychromed wood with painted glass eyes. The only information I was able to find about this artist and work was from this conservation article (PDF) which explains that there were ""disfiguring insect holes [that] marred the beauty of the sculpture. A flexible fill material was needed that could accommodate the expansion and contraction of the wood without being invasive structurally. Microcrystalline wax mixed with powdered pigments was used to replicate flesh tones. The channels left by the insects are not completely filled. A small amount of wax is smoothed just over the top of the exit hole.""  You can see the before and after images here."
ArtefactPorn,30xfej,Respectfullyyours,2,Tue Mar 31 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"This artifact is currently at the British Museum and their website talks about it in a little more detail -    When a prominent person died in Korea, it was traditional to erect a tombstone and bury a set of plaques inscribed with an epitaph, words written in memory of the deceased. If for any reason the tombstone was removed or destroyed, the epitaphs would still remain. The number of plaques reflected the importance of the deceased.  These fourteen tablets are one of the largest sets known. The underglaze-painted blue calligraphy ('beautiful writing') records the life of Kim Chun-kun (1814-1847), a member of the Andong Kim clan. This clan was one of the three royal in-law families that dominated the authority of the Korean throne during the early nineteenth century. After his death, Kim Chun-kun was awarded the rank of Yong Wi-jing, or Minister of State.As well as providing information about the deceased, epitaph tablets are also interesting to the scholar because they help to date developments in the techniques of ceramics manufacture."

I believe the Cathedral Treasury referred to is the one at Aachen which has a number of extraordinary pieces in the collection. The 1450 date, I believe, does not refer to when it was made, but maybe more likely when it came into the possession of the Cathedral Treasury's collection."

I just meant that there is always this notion that in German, there is one specific word for every little thing, but we just form compound words without spaces in between. But I agree, if you don't know the components of a compound word in a foreign language, it looks funny. Other languages have similar rules, apparently ""atomiydinenergiareaktorigeneraattorilauhduttajaturbiiniratasvaihde"" is a valid Finnish word."
ArtefactPorn,30tgz0,OneMoGin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"Kind of.   ""Foot reliquary"" in English would imply that there was a foot inside, or that the reliquary was meant to hold a foot (which maybe it is? I'm still not really sure what we're looking at here as most reliquaries are just decorated displays with relics inside). We'd call this a ""foot-shaped reliquary"" or something similar - or ""reliquary to hold a foot"" if that's in fact its use. Not a big difference, but important one.  Also perhaps spaceship and space ship are not the best examples of how nouns are combined in English. Maybe more like ""horseshoe"" v ""horse shoe"" - one being that with which you shoe a horse, the other being, perhaps, a shoe with pictures of horses on it."

In Matthew's account, magi from the east go to Judea in search of the newborn king of the Jews, having ""seen his star in the east"". The King, Herod the Great, directs them to Bethlehem, and asks them to let him know who this king is when they find him. They find Jesus and honor him, but an angel tells them not to alert Herod, and they return home by another way.   This is because Herod ordered all the newborns in Bethlehem to be killed so the chosen one wouldn't take his place, but they managed to escape and head to Egypt instead."
ArtefactPorn,30swlm,texanwill,29,Mon Mar 30 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"From the Metropolitan Museum of Art:  These unusual boots present a bit of a mystery. The general construction and appearance resembles shoes of the early 1800s. Although the size suggests they were made for a man, the elongated point toe was stylish for women in the period 1795-1810 but extremely unusual for menswear. Additionally, the side lacing was very uncommon until 1830, and the leather thong shoelace, cut in a curve, is also peculiar. This combination of features suggests that the shoes were made for some context outside of fashionable wear, perhaps as a local peculiarity or as a fancy dress costume."

ArtefactPorn,30tg20,Respectfullyyours,16,Mon Mar 30 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"This sculpture is from the British Museum. Their website explains a little more in detail the moment that is being depicted -    Siddhartha's idyllic life was interrupted at the age of 19, when he went outside his palace and saw the 'four sights': an old man, a sick man, a corpse and an ascetic. He resolved to renounce his luxurious life, leaving his palace to go out and seek a way out of this world and its inevitable suffering. He tried various methods, under different teachers, but dissatisfied with their instruction, he left to practise religious austerities on his own. He pursued physical hardships to such an extent that he reduced himself to an emaciated state. This was not an unknown feature in the early historic period in India, where renunciation and asceticism (the self-denial of certain pleasures, or even what are usually considered essential practices of life) was a traditional method of building up spiritual power and purity.  This sculpture captures that time when the Buddha had brought himself close to death. This is not a common subject, but a few powerful and graphic pieces such as this one are known from Gandhara. After pursuing austerities, Siddhartha realized that the true nature of the world and the answers that he was seeking did not lie in such extremes. Instead, he began a more moderate life of meditation and moral conduct that led him to nirvana. This moderate lifestyle the Buddha described as the 'Middle Way', a key feature of Buddhist life even today."

ArtefactPorn,30ti5v,Respectfullyyours,3,Mon Mar 30 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Like the foot reliquary I also submitted today, this is from the National Swiss Museum's collection. Unfortunately they don't have much information about it, but you can find it by searching their collection under the name ""bigimage RELIQUIENBÜSTE"" (it won't let me link to it directly).   I believe the Cathedral Treasury referred to is the one at Aachen which has a number of extraordinary pieces in the collection. Reliquaries would have held the bones or teeth or other parts of a Saintly body inside and would be housed within a church, usually in a public area where visitors to the church could pay homage. Reliquaries were huge draws, and churches with ""good ones"" or particularly rare reliquaries drew more pilgrims and therefore more donations for the church.   I find this one curious in particular, as I've never seen on where the face is on the body. I suppose if we knew who the Saint being honoured was, we might have a better idea of why he was portrayed like this."
ArtefactPorn,30ti5v,Forlurn,3,Mon Mar 30 16:14:37 2015 UTC,Maybe John the Baptist whose head was removed?  Although there are probably way more biblical figures that got beheaded.

The Baptist is the only one of these properly considered a saint, although many early Christians were beheaded and revered as saints later. St. Denis is a popular example."

It is formed from a wooden board, which had decayed, covered with strips of copper secured with copper nails. The area between the borders was covered with bitumen and the figures were pressed into it. The bulls are made in one piece of Tridacna shell with the legs and head carved separately. The background was filled with black shale cut to shape. All the pieces of inlay were in place when it was found, except the body of the last bull which had been forced away from its backing and lay in three pieces.  Several more or less complete sections of panel were found, along with numerous scattered figures and fragments from a second frieze which had ornamented the façade of the temple."

The elbow joint can be moved by releasing a spring, whereas the top joint of the wrist allows a degree of rotation and an up-and-down motion. The fingers can also curl up and straighten out. The leather upper arm piece is used to fix the prosthesis to the remaining upper arm. The rather sinister appearance of the hand suggests the wearer may have disguised it with a glove.""   Source."

ArtefactPorn,30q7zc,evileine,10,Mon Mar 30 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"It would probably cost an arm and a leg! (I'm so sorry, I had too :P)  But seriously, only the elite would have had access to something like this, and even then it was the working class who would more often lose their limbs coming in close contact with heavy machinery in factories. For the lower classes, peg legs would be common but there really was no adequate substitute for a lost arm.   This article has a little more detail -    Most amputees of the time, whether soldiers or civilians, could be assured of some kind of replacement, however rudimentary.  In those pre-anaesthesia times, the process of first having the offending limb sawed off was an intimidating prospect and one with a mortality rate of about 30%.  Wealthy amputees could aspire to advanced prosthetics, known as “cork legs” (made in Cork Street), which offered jointed movement and expensive blends of materials such as ivory, steel, leather and vulcanized rubber.  The less fortunate had to make do with “peg” legs.  “Cork legs” developed a good deal over the course of the nineteenth century, with features such as ivory balls in rubber-socketed ankles for a fuller range of movement, whilst lightweight leather prosthetics were also developed which could be laced on like knee boots.  Advanced legs of this sort were not only superior in the natural movement they supplied but also were less liable than basic wooden legs to rotting and splitting mid-stride."

Fitton (1780–1861) and John Aryton Paris (1785–1856), who were themselves inspired by Charles Babbage (1792–1871). A different picture is applied to either side of the ‘wonder disc’, to which two cords are attached.  When the disc is rotated at speed – the best method is to take the cords between one’s thumbs and index fingers – the two images are superimposed on each other, the motifs having been specifically chosen to complement each other and merge optically. For instance, if there is a bird on one side and an empty cage on the other, the viewer has the impression that the bird is trapped in the cage.   Source."

ArtefactPorn,3090zg,reedfriendly,14,Wed Mar 25 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the unfortunate problem with the performance... they played the things by stuffing a modern trumpet mouthpiece in there with paper and played it that way. So the way it sounds here is probably nothing like it sounded back in the day. Modern trumpets maintain a relatively stable harmonic series due to their being quite long in comparison to their width. Forcing a modern mouthpiece into a wide instrument yeilded a quite out-of-tune harmonic series. By contrast, these instruments with their width would have not been so strongly tied to the harmonic series at all, but would have acted as a resonator for whatever pitch the players lips could create. In a way this is more freeing. The musician is not tied to the harmonic series and can create complex, even vocal melodies purely by strength of lip and ear. Something that would have been immediately obvious if they'd consulted an organologist and hadn't rushed to make a pompous spectacle of the thing.  TLDR: Any tube with a proportional mouthpiece and diameter will play the same. This instrument plays completely diffetent."

ArtefactPorn,3090zg,-klassy-,10,Wed Mar 25 18:16:53 2015 UTC,makes me wonder how they were played back then. do we have any knowledge of music from that era of Egypt?
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,barnaclejuice,19,Wed Mar 25 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately a bit difficult to say what music was like in Ancient Egypt. Not much evidence is left. They didn't have notation as we do. Researchers did find scores of songs from the Greek settlements at Oxyrhynchus (if I remember well), but it was Greek music with Greek notation.   That said, Egyptians had sort of Conductor, who would gesture to the players which notes to play. This guy is what we call a Chironomist. Although we have depictions of these gestures we don't really know which note which gesture meant. They also had no indication of rhythm and mode. We have surviving musical instruments, which have been replicated. These replicas were used to try and reconstruct some of the music of the time based on Egyptian folk music and the above-mentioned gesture depictions. In spite of the lack of notational evidence, music was obviously greatly enjoyed and it's not at all an unusual theme in all things Ancient Egypt.  This song is a reconstruction from tomb paintings from the 14th Century BCE. If you're interested in ancient music, the album it's from is a nice addition to your collection!"
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,-klassy-,6,Wed Mar 25 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the info! I figured we wouldn't have much by the way of songs since music wasn't recorded quite the same way we've been doing ""these days"".

ArtefactPorn,3090zg,frankenham,10,Wed Mar 25 16:26:31 2015 UTC,Darude Sandstorm was actually based off an ancient Egyptian hymn that they would play in the morning everyday during the first week of summer as a way to ward off a gods wrath. I remember watching some German accordion player explain it on youtube a while ago saying how it was found with a collection of some of the oldest known written music transcribed into clay tablets. The Egyptians were known for their droning rhythms sections and climatic lead buildups. A lot of music theory originated with the ancient Egyptians and Greek.
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,clinically_proven,3,Thu Mar 26 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, they got it from the Sumerians..and even the Sumerians very clearly said it was handed down to them from a older extinct civilization that is now believed to be in modern Turkey.   Darude Sandstorm is likely the genesis of human civilization."
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,peoplearejustpeople9,3,Thu Mar 26 05:15:31 2015 UTC,So when a song name is requested and people say it's Darude Sandstorm they're technically correct?
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,frankenham,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well the thing about the original Darude Sandstorm is that it was a 17 part movement and within the entire movement contained nearly every single variant of all the modern day 4/4 chord progressions; I, IV, II, V- I, III, V, I even the blues I, IV, V ect.. Of course there are different keys you can use these in but the original Darude Sandstorn is the laying foundation of practically all modern music which is why it's become a sort of meme joke to call all songs Darude Sandstorm on youtube and reddit because in a way they sort of are. The modern day Darude- Sandstorm is actually Sympathy 7, 2nd movement ""Morning Sun"" of the original piece."

ArtefactPorn,3090zg,Kubi74,3,Thu Mar 26 05:13:31 2015 UTC,I'm not an egyptologist but it isn't impossible that there are surviving musical notations from ancient Egypt.
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,Worsaae,2,Thu Mar 26 08:01:04 2015 UTC,how? they had a notation system for music? I am not aware of such a thing.
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,Worsaae,3,Thu Mar 26 09:16:31 2015 UTC,"As said, I am not an egyptologist, I am an archaeologist, but if I remember correctly there are some clay tablets from Sumer (ca. 2000 BC) that contains musical notations."
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,ch0pp3r,2,Thu Mar 26 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"Also, I just wiki'ed ancient Egyptian musical notation and then this showed up:    The ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of Hathor because both were depicted as cows. Hathor's music was believed to have been used by Osiris as part of his effort to civilize the world. The lion-goddess Bastet was also considered a goddess of music.  The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played.[1] Percussion instruments,and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals[2] frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today.  Typically ancient Egyptian music was composed from the phrygian dominant scale, phrygian scale, Double harmonic scale (Arabic scale) or lydian scale. The phrygian dominant scale may often feature an altered note or two in parts to create tension. For instance the music could typically be in the key of E phrygian dominant using the notes E, F, G sharp, A, B, C, D and then have an A sharp, B, A sharp, G natural and E to create tension."
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,Roryrooster,2,Thu Mar 26 09:52:12 2015 UTC,The picture shows the silver trumpet and the wooden core that was kept inside the instrument when it wasn't being used.  Too bad they broke it--silver is particularly subject to age-induced precipitation hardening.  I suppose the annealing the trumpet underwent during the restoration (when the fragments were brazed together) made it possible to play again without damaging it.  Not sure the video mentions it but the higher tone is almost impossible to produce without a modern mouthpiece and the lower tone is poor.  It's thought that the midtone of the instrument was the only note utilized and the trumpet was used to mark cadence for marching rather than for something like fanfares.
ArtefactPorn,3090zg,porkfish66,2,Wed Mar 25 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"The Coptic church in Egypt, one of the oldest Christian sects, still play a style of religious music that is believed to be very similar to the music styles of the Ancient Egyptians."

The idea with weapons like this would be simplicity, ease of use and in this case looking good while hunting. Using a regular bow is much harder and much less forgiving if you mess up. This is for nobility and their hunting trips, one has to look proper."

ArtefactPorn,304nt6,bombos,7,Wed Mar 25 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Kind of disagree; although learning spanish might have more obvious and frequent utility, the less common the language you've learned is, the more people will pay to find somebody who speaks it.

As both a Farsi-speaker and an interviewer/hirer, foreign language capabilities are nice to see, but it's not nearly as interesting as you suggest. Unless you are say working in a service role within an area that contains that language community.   If you want a good conversation starter during an interview, tell them things about their company they don't know. Or breakdown a product they produce in a casual but analytical way. Even speaking passionately hobbies would be more interesting than ""I know this cool language"". And if you're not phenotypically Middle Eastern, I'm probably gonna follow up with why you learned it (in this e.g. Farsi). And I'm sure you wouldn't truthfully say ""to seem more interesting in interviews""."

ArtefactPorn,304nt6,JeepGuy316,24,Tue Mar 24 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"The most likely reason I can think would be when the Medes and Persians conquered most of ancient Mesopotamia. They absorbed the defeated nations along with their cultures into their empire, and that would include the ancient Assyrians. So that's one possibility for the presence of Lamassu in Iran.  Then again, similar creatures can be seen in the artwork of other nations near Assyria. The ancient Sumerians and Akkadians both had Lamassu (which predate the Assyrians) and the ancient Hebrews had Cherubim (which are described similarly to the appearance of Lamassu). At the very least, it would appear that these mythical beings were fairly common in the myths and art of ancient Mesopotamia and the Levant."

First striking the armour the shock of the initial impact would be sent throughout the shell.  I also belive that the shells are somewhat similar to Rupert Drop.  Extremely hard on the outside due to tension on the surface and 'soft' in the inside. The tip has the most surface to volume ratio out of the whole she'll so I like to think it's the strongest.

It was in over one hundred and fifty pieces on discovery, which explains its fragmentary condition after reconstruction. It consists of two parts: the helmet itself, and a crown that was fixed to the lower rim above the visor. Thanks to the precious materials and elaborate technique with which it was made (chased, enameled, and gilded copper), it was immediately identified as a parade helmet rather than protective headgear for war or tournaments. The fleur-de-lis decoration, fleurons on the crown, and fleur-de-lis motif in the rectangular enameled medallions indicate that it was a royal helmet. The 1411 inventory refers to a ""...hat of gilded iron with fleur-de-lis raised to a crown, winged stags below, and a motto saying EN BIEN with a fleur-de-lis above."" Traces of the inscription (""En ien"") are still visible, as are the fixation holes for the two winged stags that were once attached to the upper part of the helmet where they sprang from a network of hazel or wild rose on a guilloche background (common on royal items).

ArtefactPorn,2zx3b2,FalstaffsMind,7,Sun Mar 22 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"Great little table on this page with radiocarbon dates on wood found at Giza.   The radiocarbon dates for the Great Pyramid ranged from 2853 to 3809 BC, which, if reliable, and if assumed to be the date of its construction, would make the Pyramid at least 400 years older than is currently believed.   Of the sixteen samples taken from the pyramid, thirteen were of charcoal. The oldest radiocarbon date from the great pyramid came from the 198th course (3809 BC). The youngest from a mortar of lime from the 2nd course. (Ref: Journal of African Civilisations Vol 12. 1994)   Oddly, it seems they also found iron in the Great Pyramid.   This is the third find of iron which can be attributed to the Old Kingdom. In 1837 a fragment of wrought-iron was discovered in an inner joint of the stone blocks in one of the 'star'-passages which pass upwards from the interior of the Great Pyramid to the outer air [Vyse, Pyramids of Gizeh, I., 276; Beck, Geschichte des Eisens, I., 85]. This is now in the British Museum, Egyptian Department, No. 2433 (3rd Egyptian Room, Case K, 29). In 1882 Professor Maspero found iron in the pyramid of a Vth Dynasty king at Abûsîr. Professor Petrie has now found iron in a VIth Dynasty deposit at Abydos... The presumption now is that the iron fragments from Abûsîr and from the Great Pyramid are of a Vth and IVth Dynasty date respectively. The Gîza fragment will be about 150 years older than the piece from Abydos. (pp. 147-49)   The fragments do not appear to be iron from meteorites; however, meteoric iron has been found in the graves of ancient Egyptians."

Dr Joyce Tyldesley is a Senior Lecturer in Egyptology at The University of Manchester and worked on the research. She said: ""Today, we see iron first and foremost as a practical, rather dull metal. To the ancient Egyptians, however, it was a rare and beautiful material which, as it fell from the sky, surely had some magical/religious properties. They therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves.""

ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,backreaper_nl,85,Sat Mar 21 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, no. Bubonic plague is primarily spread by the bite of infected fleas meaning the doctors were never at any real threat from being infected by aerial transmission. This means in its intended purpose the mask was of little use.  However the whole Plague Doctor outfit and training emphasised layers of tough leather or thick clothing completely covering the body and touching infected patients as little as possible (In many depictions Plague Doctors are seen holding a stick which was used to lift sheets and move clothing in order to avoid touching the patient). This helped prevent them from coming into contact with infected fleas and as such provided them with some small degree of protection.  EDIT: It's worth mentioning that bubonic plague can develop into pneumonic plague (where it infects the lungs) and the more fatal septicemic plague (where it infects the blood). These forms of plague can be transmitted (rarely) via aerial transmission or and in the case of septicemic plague, via contact with infected tissue. Whilst I do not know for certain, it seems unlikely a mess of herbs or vinegar soaked material would actively serve as an effective bacterial filter against this airborne bacteria.  EDIT 2: As others have mentioned, at the time doctors had every reason it may help prevent infection due to belief in the Miasma theory which was based on the idea that bad odours or ""bad air"" spread infection. Obviously herbs or vinegar would block the smell and as such the doctors would believe they were offered protection.  On another note, having looked into it a bit further vinegar does possess some anti-bacterial properties. There's a chance vinegar soaked sponges may have helped kill or filter some airborne bacteria. Whether or not this would have stopped the airborne strand of the pneumonic plague I do not know. Remember, the bubonic plague itself cannot be transmitted aerially, become pneumonic plague when it infects the lungs and only then (and not always) can it be transmitted aerially."
ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,Leothefox,33,Sat Mar 21 19:01:57 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the herbs/ vinegar sure helped with the smell though.
ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,Berkbelts,30,Sat Mar 21 20:15:06 2015 UTC,Not just to help smell. But they believed that the smell spreads diseases.  Its called miasma theory.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory

ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,stupidgnomes,2,Sat Mar 21 22:47:48 2015 UTC,There is a possibility it was spread by gerbils:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/24/after-8-centuries-rats-exonerated-in-spread-of-black-death-gerbils-implicated/

ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,TastyBrainMeats,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:24:16 2015 UTC,Would the mask help with other airborne diseases? Would the vinegar filter stop any bacteria or would it just waltz on through to the lungs?
ArtefactPorn,2zto7b,CrumpetDestroyer,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Due to its acidic nature, vinegar (acetic acid) is a somewhat reasonable disinfectant. Some bacteria coming into direct contact with the vinegar may be killed, but many others are resistant. It's possible that the mask in this case would be able to prevent some infection. However it's just as possible for the bacteria to miss the vinegar as it is to get caught in it and die.  Also, not all of these masks were stuffed with vinegar. Plenty were just stuffed with herbs which are unlikely to have been any real help."

The tusk swords that accompany this armour (not on display) weigh in at 10kg.  It is the only animal armour of this scale on public display and recently entered the Guinness Book of Records as the largest animal armour in the world.  Acquired in India by Lady Clive, wife of Edward, 2nd Lord Clive (Governor of Madras), between 1798 and 1800, and brought back to England in 1801; displayed in the Elephant Room at Powis Castle. Placed on loan to the Armouries in 1949 for conservation.  Presented to the nation in lieu of death duty by the Earl of Powis in 1962 and placed in the care of the Armouries.  Until the widespread introduction of firearms war elephants were a dominant force in Indian warfare. Many were provided with complete armours, yet this is the only near-complete surviving example in the world. Arms and armour from India form the largest part of the Royal Armouries Asian collection, and include the largest armour in the whole collection, the only elephant armour in captivity. Probably made in one of the arsenals of the Mughal Empire in northern India in the late 16th or early 17th century, in its present state, with two of its mail and plate panels missing, it weighs 142 kg. It is made of some 8450 iron plates joined by rows of riveted mail. The armour also has a pair of tusk swords, with heavy sockets to fit the elephant’s sworn-off tusks and fierce wavy blades with strong armour piercing points."

ArtefactPorn,2ztq3x,innuendoPL,10,Sat Mar 21 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"This is the last Royal armour in the Royal Armouries collection. The armour is known from the record of its price, £100, to have been made by Richard Holden and delivered on 14 December 1686. It is the only finely decorated royal armour ever known to have been made by a member of the London Armourers Company, and the last.    It is an harquebusier’s armour comprising a pot, breastplate, backplate and long elbow gauntlet, essentially the same as the ordinary munition armours made for the contemporary cavalry, but of rather finer quality. Like the ordinary munition armours the cuirass bears the proof marks that attest that it is bullet proof. The whole armour is decorated with punched, engraved and originally gilt bands of trophies. The faceguard is fretted and decorated with the initials IR for Iacobus Rex and with the Royal Arms and their supporters, the lion and the unicorn. The central band on the breastplate has at the top IR separated by a crown and surmounted by a figure 2, with crossed sceptres below.    Richard Holden, from Swadlincote in Derbyshire, was apprenticed to a London armourer in 1658 and made free in 1665. From 1673 he was supplying munition armour to the Board of Ordnance, and by 1681 he had become the armourer responsible for Royal commissions. He was involved in the negotiations that resulted in the incorporation of the Brasiers into the Armourers Company in 1708, though he was too old to sit on the Court of Assistants that was formed to control the new company. He died in 1709, the last of the London armourer makers. Source      close up picture Another similar armor is on display at the Mit Museum."

Instead he would probably have had a wheellock or flintlock pistol or two.    A gauntlet worn on the least dominant hand is common because slashing at a horses reigns was one of the more popular ways to defeat a horseman at the time.  Additionally combat between two horseman often came down to jockeying for position, wherein the opponents would do their best to come up to the reigns-hand side of their enemy.  This limited the effectiveness of his enemies attacks.  Because of these two things the reigns hand (usually the left) was much more vulnerable.  Couple this with a lack of need for manual dexterity while holding the reigns and you see the use of one gauntlet."

In contrast to many similar statuettes, the faces of which have lost most of their original detail, this sculpture has fine facial features, including small eyes and ears and a linear nose. Also evident is the distinctive layered wool textile, known as kaunakes in southern Iran and Mesopotamia, which is commonly associated with the garment of deities and princesses in the ancient civilizations of Elam and Sumer.

ArtefactPorn,2zos4q,thegandza,-1,Sat Mar 21 01:25:23 2015 UTC,"No she was born in Macedonia. Source my Roman history professor who has a phd on the subject and can speak fluent latin so he can directly translate roman text to us.  I'm studying this at university and I literally heard my prof mention that the fact that she was born in Egypt is a misconception not true and that she was white as she was Macedonian.     You cant trust all sources you hear, I dont know where you are quoting that she was born in Egypt, but if Wikipedia is your source I doubt you are right, my prof shows us how many modern historians are wrong, he finds something they say on video and then reads the latin source text on it and explains what it really says."
ArtefactPorn,2zos4q,TempeGrouch,3,Sat Mar 21 09:54:29 2015 UTC,"I do admit that I do not have my sources as I'm not a classicist, but I'm definitely sure that she was born in Alexandria.  Macedonia was a Roman province for a good century when she was born and so it would be almost impossible for her to be from there.  If she did came from Macedon itself, I would have heard of a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty traveling to Roman occupied Macedonia (which was very Romanized since the Mithradatic Wars), gave birth, and then travel back to Egypt.  As we have very detailed understanding of Ptolemaic genealogies, someone would've picked this up. There is no academic publications showing this, and I had a quick look up at JSTOR before typing this.  So yeah, I need proof about this allegation or I'm calling BS.  EDIT: I just reread your comment and I think you really misunderstood what I said or your professor. There is no doubt that she was white and I'm not arguing that she was dark skinned. Cleopatra VII was from the Ptolemaic dynasty which was a Macedonian-Greek dynasty. It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, a general of Alexander the Great and he took over Egypt in the aftermath of Alexander's death.   So yes, she was of Macedonian-Greek descent but was born in Egypt. Cleopatra would've seen herself as part of the Hellenistic Greek diaspora that defined that era."

ArtefactPorn,2zos4q,IrungamesOldtimer,2,Fri Mar 20 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"Conversely, as a historian in training, I think that people should temper this anachronistic thinking to a certain extent. It does hold true in some cases, and it is entertaining. However, it becomes all too easy to start projecting some serious nonsense onto historical cultures that in many ways were radically different from our own.   We can look at Greek homoerotic vase paintings and titter about how they were ""homosexual"", but that doesn't really capture their way of understanding sex. Historical cultures did not have the same ideas of identity and how it intersects with sexuality. Their gender roles often differ, to the point where their conception of ""gender"" was not really anything like ours. So many of our modern attitudes completely differ in epistemology to the point where it is silly to draw parallels. The multitude of ways in which their experience differed, and how their methods of socializing do not align with ours far outweigh the parallels. Yeah, people are people. But human culture is vast, even today."

ArtefactPorn,2zos4q,hooah212002,3,Sat Mar 21 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"No, I believe you're misunderstanding me. Sometimes even things like  ""romance"" are artifacts of our modern way of thinking. What I'm saying is that people might assume, ""Oh, yeah, they're still human. So they were just like us."" when often they really were not. In the process, you construct people who never existed. Sometimes the differences in culture can be so profound that you would find their society alienating were you to really know it well.   The impetus to forge empathisable subjects in history is that it makes history feel more compelling, and amusing. The problem is that this can taint study, and the wider, popular idea of the past. Thinking that you know them, that you get them, -cause hey, they're just like you- is a fallacious and dangerous impression.   For an example: Victorian-era historical thought is absolute garbage because of this. They spent so much time projecting themselves, and their values onto the Romans and Greeks, that they ended up erasing and ignoring much of the actual history. It affected how they interpreted material culture, and warped their reading of documentation. Proper analysis is best when you make an effort to get in their heads, not integrate them into yours. Of course, you're always going to be bringing the baggage of modern thought with you. But it need not be so blinding."

ArtefactPorn,2zp07f,BetaKeyTakeaway,3,Fri Mar 20 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"Egyptian temples were not simply houses for a cult image but also represented, in their design and decoration, a variety of religious and mythological concepts. One important symbolic aspect was based on the understanding of the temple as an image of the natural world as the Egyptians knew it. Lining the temple base are carvings of papyrus and lotus plants that seem to grow from water, symbolized by figures of the Nile god Hapy. The two columns on the porch rise toward the sky like tall bundles of papyrus stalks with lotus blossoms bound with them. Above the gate and temple entrance are images of the sun disk flanked by the outspread wings of Horus, the sky god. The sky is also represented by the vultures, wings outspread, that appear on the ceiling of the entrance porch.  On the outer walls between earth and sky are carved scenes of the king making offerings to deities who hold scepters and the ankh, the symbol of life. The figures are carved in sunk relief. In the brilliant Egyptian sunlight, shadows cast along the figures' edges would have emphasized their outlines. Isis, Osiris, their son Horus, and the other deities are identified by their crowns and the inscriptions beside their figures. These scenes are repeated in two horizontal registers. The king is identified by his regalia and by his names, which appear close to his head in elongated oval shapes called cartouches; many of the cartouches simply read ""pharaoh."" This king was actually Caesar Augustus of Rome, who, as ruler of Egypt, had himself depicted in the traditional regalia of the pharaoh. Augustus had many temples erected in Egyptian style, honoring Egyptian deities. This small temple, built about 15 B.C., honored the goddess Isis and, beside her, Pedesi and Pihor, deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain. In the first room of the temple, reliefs again show the ""pharaoh"" praying and offering to the gods, but the relief here is raised from the background so that the figures can be seen easily in the more indirect light. From this room one can look into the temple past the middle room used for offering ceremonies and into the sanctuary of the goddess Isis. The only carvings in these two rooms are around the door frame leading into the sanctuary and on the back wall of the sanctuary, where a relief depicts Pihor worshiping Isis, and below – partly destroyed – Pedesi worshiping Osiris.   http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/547802?high=on&rpp=30&pg=4&rndkey=20150320&ft=*&pos=92"
ArtefactPorn,2zp0rf,BetaKeyTakeaway,3,Fri Mar 20 12:54:57 2015 UTC,"The pose of this fragmentary torso suggests that the figure, who wears a short cape and an ornate cuirass of Hellenistic type, was originally riding a rearing horse, the left hand holding the reins while the right wielded a weapon. Dynamic equestrian bronze statues have a long tradition in Hellenistic and Roman art, stemming from Lysippos' famous group showing Alexander the Great on horseback, which commemorates the Macedonian leader's first major victory over the Persians at the Granikos River. The Romans sometimes adopted cuirasses of Hellenistic type. This fact, the widespread popularity of the equestrian statue as a public monument in antiquity, and the dearth of preserved examples hamper close dating of the torso. Technical and stylistic considerations lean toward a somewhat provincial, likely Roman, workshop.  The cuirass is decorated with two running friezes in high relief. Arimaspians, a legendary tribe from the distant north, combat griffins in the upper frieze. Sea griffins, dolphins, and palms decorate the lower one. Such potent imagery alludes to victory and the heroic valor of this tribe from across the sea, on the fringes of the world. In Roman times, imagery of Arimaspians was sometimes linked to the Parthians.   http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/257639?high=on&rpp=30&pg=4&rndkey=20150320&ft=*&pos=119&imgno=0&tabname=label"

ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,Rubius0,19,Thu Mar 19 17:19:31 2015 UTC,I feel like the ancient Nubian culture is underappreciated.
ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,GylleTheGreat,17,Thu Mar 19 17:56:01 2015 UTC,I agree! I had no idea how much rich history there was in Africa. We never learned about it in school with the exception of Ancient Egypt and the scramble for Africa.
ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,AnalyticalAlpaca,4,Thu Mar 19 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"I have some crazy thought experiments about Africa.  They basically go like this:    Humans and humanlike creatures have been in Africa for hundreds of thousands to millions of years.  Every few tens of thousands of years there's an Ice Age and pluvial periods that basically remodel the surface of the earth.  If you think about it, there's every possibility that there have been past civilizations and even advanced civilizations in Africa whose traces have been wiped from the face of the earth and there's no way we would know about it.  Given how quickly civilization arose and developed in the past few thousand years, it even seems more likely that there have been past vanished civilizations than that there has not been any such over the course of hundreds of thousands of years."
ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,wonderful_wonton,27,Fri Mar 20 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"This is a bit tricky to explain:  Look around your house right now. At your desk, how many flint scrapers do you have? How many stone hand axes? None, I'm guessing. That is because they are not part of a particular ""toolkit"" (computers, pens, scissors, forks, etc) characteristic of here and now. Now, imagine your house torn down and covered in three meters of dirt and let it sit for, say, five thousand years. A lot of your cutlery will probably rust away, everything wooden will be long since gone, but there will still be plates, plastic, and other remains of your ""toolkit"". This reveals particular things about your way of life.  The reason I am saying this is because through excavation we have uncovered many examples of ""toolkits"" from very far back indeed, in fact farther back than humans existed. We have wooden spears of Homo heidelbergensis from a German coal mine, we have stone scrapers of homo erectus, we have stone scrapers from austrolopithicus. And we have lots and lots and lots of material from homo sapiens. And what we find are not the sort of forks and plates and plastic bottles you have around your house, but stone hand axes and flint scrapers. Furthermore, we have uncovered fire pits and camp sites of early homo sapiens, but not houses and walls and cities. In short, the material that has been found is not indicative of what you might call ""vanished civilizations"". It is indicative of small bands of hunter gatherers, living off the land within their means.  Trust me, you are not the first person to think this. But there are many very intelligent and very dedicated people working on human life before the Holocene (the current geological period, beginning around 10,000 BCE) and the material they have found point unambiguously to a way of life very different than what you are asking.  Also, it is worth noting that Africa was not touched by glaciers."

ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,wonderful_wonton,8,Fri Mar 20 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"My pleasure! I hope it made sense, I find it really difficult sometimes to explain what archaeology is all about. If you are interested in the Paleolithic (which is basically the period before agriculture) I would recommend trying to find Brian Fagan's Cro-Magnon, a really wonderfully written book about Paleolithic Europe."

ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,wonderful_wonton,2,Fri Mar 20 02:49:57 2015 UTC,"But what about the ancient civilization of the Sea Kings buried beneath the Antarctic ice?  Okay, sure, it's bunk, but it's highly entertaining bunk. I'm not an archaeologist, so my opinion on the subject is worth bupkes, but I find the thought experiment compelling. If there were an ancient civilization that was focused on the sea, far fewer of their artifacts would have been preserved. And good boat technology does not necessarily require technology far in advance of flint scrapers and stone hand axes, as shown by the fact of Polynesian seafaring.  I just fear that many people immediately associate the idea of ""ancient civilizations"" with ""ancient high-tech civilizations"" and close themselves off to ideas that might lead to fruitful inquiry."
ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,ishldgetoutmore,2,Fri Mar 20 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Ottoman empire is outside my specialty so I would need to do a bit more legwork than I feel inclined to, so I will just focus on the Antarctica thing:  the number of scientific fields that need to be not just wrong, but catastrophically wrong, for Hancock's Antarctica thing to be right is absurd. The theory in its entirety rests on a bed of logic no more firm than speculating whether Tyrannosaurus Rexes still exist, just not when anybody is looking.  For Polynesia, I made a slight mistake because I should have made it clear that I am not talking about ""high tech"" vs ""low tech"". In fact, I think the distinction is actually somewhat unhelpful when looking at toolkits as a whole. Rather I am talking about what you might call characteristic artefacts, that is, artefacts that are characteristic of a particular life style. You don't find iron mouldboard ploughs on a Polynesian site, and likewise you don't find complex navigational instruments on a Swiss farm. In this mold, things that usually fall under the heading of ""civilization"" are things like cities, large structures, specialized labor and the like. We don't find these before 10,000 BCE.  Now this does not mean that people were primitive or any less intelligent. They had rich and complex social worlds, they had incredible understanding of their natural environment, they must have had beautiful stories and some of their artistic creations still astounds. They were in no way inferior to later people we call civilized, but they did have a different life style."
ArtefactPorn,2zldl9,Tiako,7,Fri Mar 20 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this has been true until very recently (like, the past couple decades) even of academic research. Nubia was frequently written off as a pale imitation of Egypt. Add to that the difficulty of excavating in Sudan and, yeah, some racism and you have a tragically sidelined era of history.  Luckily this has very much changed now and there is a real appreciation of Nubia as a distinct and grand civilization in its own right. Here is my favorite thing to say about Nubia: When we think of Egypt, we always picture Pyramids, right? But the famous pyramids were pretty much all constructed in a fairly discrete period of time, in the Third and Fourth Dynasties (about 2700 BCE-25 BCE). Later pyramids tend to be, with apologies to the otherwise super cool Middle Kingdom, kind of paltry. The Nubians, on the other hand, picked up the slack.  If you are interested, check out this quick introduction by Geoff Emberling, one of the researchers in the region."
