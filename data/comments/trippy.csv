trippy,3dgo1n,codyave,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:06 2015 UTC,I say yay and can someone say some math about this please?
trippy,3dgo1n,glitchbent,12,Thu Jul 16 03:23:10 2015 UTC,"Here's some copy/paste from my x-post:   In case you'd like to know what goes into the making of a gif like this:  This was a large project, even though the end result is somewhat tame. I did it because I feel this scene paints Homer in a somber and reflective state, which is something we don't get to see often enough. Maybe the only other scene that lives up to this kind of tone is from ""Mother Simpson"", where Homer's mom leaves his life for the second time after being gone for 25 years.  The big problem was that Marge doesn't rotate fully. There's no shortcut to make it look good, so I cut/pasted/clone-stamped/warped/distorted six new frames of Marge to make the loop seamless (this may explain why, if you've seen this gif before, most of the frames have been removed so you wouldn't notice the obvious jump cut). The original is 74 frames, so adding 6 more gives us 80 frames, which is perfect because it is divisible by 16 (the amount of frames of Homer's running), and goes into 1920 perfectly (the pixel width of the desert background).   From the desert background, I needed 80 frames so it would loop exactly when Marge looped. 1920 pixels divided by 80 frames = 24 pixels per frame. So, all I needed to do to get a gif out of it was to move the background to the left by 24 pixels each frame, save as a PNG, do this 80 times, and then import these PNGs as a sequence, where we get this. The loop of Homer running is 16 frames, so all I did was repeat that five times to get that part done. Also, a bit of work was done to keep Homer's facial expression subdued, so it wouldn't take over the final look of things.  Getting Marge to loop seamlessly took much much longer than I anticipated because everything had to be just perfect (the hair, the hands, the shoulders, the necklace, the midtones of the arms and dress and hair), otherwise the loop was very noticeable.     Video clip from s08e09 ""El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer"" for context  2D vs 3D vs original gif comparison  Homer running by himself  Also from the same episode    Edit: (If I can toot my own horn for a second) Due to the time involved, the difficulty, and fairly obscure reference, I'm very confident this is best loop of this scene anyone's gonna get for a loooooooong time. [End toot]"

trippy,3ddvar,gettingignorant,0,Wed Jul 15 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I just looked up the rules now and saw the no content on multiple subreddits rule. I apologize for that! I didn't do it with any ill intentions, I just saw these subreddits as having subscribers who would probably enjoy my work, so I figured why not share on all of them? I'll have to figure out which one to put them on from now on. I'm not attempting to make any money from this, but as a small but passionate artist, the more eyes that see my work, the better.

There are no recognisable shapes in the images, but I prefer that spacey/under-water feel to it.  Unfortunately it is now discontinued, but we picked ours up last year on eBay for around Â£100.  I mentioned your post to my husband, and he linked me this: Swarm 5 FX by CHAUVET DJ and tells me that we can get one on eBay for about Â£150.  I think you may have just convinced us we need both, so I might find myself Â£150 worse off in a moment, with a shiny new laser set-up on it's way.  Edit: linked the first one twice by mistake."

trippy,36sjyv,CIV_QUICKCASH,-1,Fri May 22 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"That concept is basically paint by number being that it is so commonly used. If one finds it art I suppose it is they are blissfully unaware, but I think personally originality to some degree is a fundamental foundation."
trippy,36qx6x,CyberianCitizen,2,Thu May 21 12:27:10 2015 UTC,Wow! So that's what these look like when they arnt moving! I like this image because it features some nice illusions but the border allows me to break it.
trippy,36qx6x,Dragonmoon333,1 point,Thu May 21 12:55:01 2015 UTC,so are they just barely not aligned? How could I go about making something similar?
trippy,36qx6x,BestUndecided,2,Thu May 21 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"It's the shadows too.  Part of the image tricks the brain into thinking it's on one side, other part on the opposite side.  When you look at one point, the rest of the image is slightly blurred due to peripheral vision, thus losing the visual cues in that area, bringing it back into the actual position"

trippy,2zpout,gixxerfanatic,1 point,Sat Mar 21 11:50:13 2015 UTC,I've never tripped LSD so this probably doesn't count for much. But I remember one time I got super super stoned and told me friends to keep twirling me on a tire swing and for some reason I can't feel dizzy when I am stoned.
trippy,2zpout,Jewfag_Cuntpuncher,1 point,Sat Mar 21 12:02:03 2015 UTC,"no, because theres so much more to it than just the visuals that may or may not occur. not saying it cant get disorientating (which it probably will at points). its not quite like anything you can imagine till you have a go, and even then, after a few times it will still surprise and inspire you"

Sex and/or exercise are usually the catalyst for my mild trip."
trippy,2zpout,420CARLSAGAN420,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Haven't done LSD in 15+ years and I can still see those colors, movements, and textures on white surfaces.    This sounds like HPPD. Although you'll find a lot of people who have never touched a psychedelic can still see psychedelic patterns if they concentrate on a surface and attempt to stop thinking (aka light meditation). It's also well established that everyone can get CEVs without taking any drugs.   Sex and/or exercise are usually the catalyst for my mild trip.    I don't have HPPD but I find this interesting because these send me super tripping if I'm tripping. Exercise on the come up I find makes things super strong and after sex or a wank I find things suddenly rapidly get massively more trippy.  I'm wondering if it's possibly to do with excess dopamine release with these activities, given that the dopamine and serotonin systems are well known to have competitive behavior."

trippy,2uyee0,cyantist,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"Quasicrystal:       A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry. While crystals, according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem, can possess only two, three, four, and six-fold rotational symmetries, the Bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry orders, for instance five-fold or seven-fold.  Aperiodic tilings were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and, some twenty years later, Alan Lindsay Mackay found to apply to predict a new kind of ordered structures (not allowed by traditional crystallography).   The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the fields of crystallography. Quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier,  but, until the 1980s, they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter. In 2009, after a dedicated search, a mineralogical finding, icosahedrite, offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals.   Roughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks translational symmetry, which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than nÂ â€“Â 1 linearly independent directions, where n is the dimension of the space filled, e.g., the three-dimensional tiling displayed in a quasicrystal may have translational symmetry in two dimensions. The ability to diffract comes from the existence of an indefinitely large number of elements with a regular spacing, a property loosely described as long-range order.

You can even install it on Knoppix 7.4 booting off a USB.  If it's a public venue going open source might have some advantages if the management wants to give you any hassles about licensing.   Also, you can just try installing it and choosing your favorite visualizations as a back up in case anything else goes wrong. Always nice to have a backup plan when you're doing a show.

trippy,2s9pz4,The_iron_lung,5,Tue Jan 13 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"Driving in Korea is an experience. This picture is from Seoul, where I've never driven, but it looks even worse than the southern end of the country. The Namhae Expressway, which cuts across Gyeongsangnamdo in the southeast, is broken up by tollbooths that spread the roadway from 4 lanes or so to 12 or so, then back down to four again. It's getting better, as they gradually revamp the old road system to include more lanes, but it's not a lot of fun driving there. The jams are incredible, even with the newer tollbooths and everyone using HiPass cards. It's taken me upwards of three hours to drive the 30 or so km from Gimhae to Haeundae, in Busan, on a Friday night. When you figure in the Korean propensity for offensive, rather than defensive, driving, it makes driving there an adventure.  There are few regular exits, either. If you miss your turn, God help you, because you're going on to the next city before you can turn around. I have been told that the reason for the roads being like this is that the main highways are based on old tank roads from the war, which were more concerned with directness than logical planning, but I have no idea if this is true.  edit: I accidentally a word"
trippy,2s9pz4,Mughi,2,Tue Jan 13 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"Oh man, driving in Seoul is insanely fun.

trippy,2p6efp,MDMA-zing,2,Sun Dec 14 01:07:29 2014 UTC,He could have explained that better but if you draw the forth one in the manner he did the others it doesn't count cause it would fall in a place already used by the first 3 axis so something could be located with 3 numbers even though its on the forth axis.

trippy,2n7yp1,spellox,0,Mon Nov 24 03:40:55 2014 UTC,I don't get it.
trippy,2n5471,smidgiemb,3,Sun Nov 23 04:43:22 2014 UTC,Delicious autonomous salt-water taffy? Yummy.
trippy,2n5471,Pongpianskul,1 point,Sun Nov 23 16:00:46 2014 UTC,It's a blue ribbon eel. I used to own one when I had a reef tank. They are amazing!
trippy,2n5471,temporalwanderer,1 point,Sun Nov 23 22:51:17 2014 UTC,Aw man that is sweet. I love when people have really nice and well taken care of tanks. I'd imagine yours had to be fairly large to hold one of those. Was it easy to take care of? I'm assuming you had other fish too.
trippy,2n5471,temporalwanderer,1 point,Tue Nov 25 05:37:45 2014 UTC,"125g+20g refugium/filter. Not easy at all. They're very hard to get to eat, and hard to contain. It was a learning curve, but worth it. Impossibly stunning in person. And yes, I had quite a few other tank residents, more corals and invertebrates than fish."
trippy,2n3mbf,chickenofthewoods,2,Sat Nov 22 19:05:33 2014 UTC,"if someone ate that thinking it was chicken of the woods, they would be in for quite a surprise!  joking aside, awesome work! i think the coolest thing is the thumbnail looks like a real fly agaric."
trippy,2n3mbf,Archons_,2,Sun Nov 23 05:20:04 2014 UTC,I thought about it when I marked it like that.  It's an old name of mine...   The reason the thumbnail looks like a real Fly Agaric is because this is just an altered photograph.    It's the best shot I've ever taken of A. muscaria.
trippy,2n0y1f,cosmodrone,5,Fri Nov 21 21:55:45 2014 UTC,Interesting.  ... I wish there was a wicked soundtrack that went with this...

trippy,2mx19f,danecarney,14,Fri Nov 21 00:16:03 2014 UTC,It's cauliflower.
trippy,2mx19f,boomatog,2,Thu Nov 20 23:55:24 2014 UTC,I've never seen cauliflower look so interesting.
trippy,2mx19f,mirandaspacefly,4,Thu Nov 20 23:59:29 2014 UTC,"Cauliflowers are interesting as fuck. Have you ever tried to break one up? It's basically a big tree-looking vegetable made of smaller tree-looking vegetables, and they get so small and tiny and the distinct smell of nature and just everything about it, the nutrients, the way how it grows inside of massive cabbage-like leaves. It's fascinating."
trippy,2mx19f,Marmelado,3,Sat Nov 22 19:39:34 2014 UTC,It's broccoli.
trippy,2mx19f,chaquarius,4,Fri Nov 21 15:09:23 2014 UTC,lol

trippy,2msj5s,Skylinerr,2,Wed Nov 19 23:38:12 2014 UTC,Didn't realize this wasn't the official video; I do think the music and video compliment each other well though.

trippy,2mhumh,bmacc,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:34:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah the video was somewhat low-Rez (need a more powerful computer to sonify HD video, even at this resolution it as 4gb of audio data) But a lot of it is Vimeo still. The file on my computer is a lot crisper :("

I don't really agree about the song though, the guy's voice is off, sounds like someone who's been singing for maybe a month or two. Maybe he went for an effect I just don't like.

trippy,2kzfe5,P8ntBal1551,4,Sat Nov 1 20:59:30 2014 UTC,"Not just focus, focal distance, which is how long the lens is. I'm not sure how this was made or how many photos went into it, but take the furthest zoomed out and the furthest zoomed in frames as two examples. When everything is compressed and the house in the background seems close, the cameraperson is using a long, telephoto lens from far away. It might be 150-200 mm long.When everything stretches out horizontally, it's because they're using a wide angle lens, maybe 25 mm long. Of course, they could have used a zoom lens. Anyway, for this effect you also have to move the camera at the same time as you change the focal length (i.e. zoom in) so that it stays approximately the same relative size in frame. It's the same technique, basically, as the Vertigo Effect in film.  (Play with this or this and you'll probably figure out some stuff about cameras.)  I am rambling because I'm high.  Nap time."

To me the designs seem like something you would find in a shopping mall store and are more kitsch or even cheesy in nature than trippy or psychedelic.  I am involved in the psychedelic trance scene and have had a bit to do with stall holders, many of them clothing designers/sellers. To me a massive part of a ""trippy"" design is the clothing itself being different in a substantial way to regular commercially available clothing. I don't think the pictures you've put up reflect that.  It looks to me like these are prints on regular shirts/jumpers manufactured by a big company, is that correct?"

trippy,2jg0fa,tjm713,1 point,Fri Oct 17 18:18:03 2014 UTC,"Whoa rough, though I'd imagine you'd have to do that legwork. I think on and off how cool it would be to have a service that could make these great sublimation shirt prints (or even leggins) on custom order with your own design. As in you hand in your design preferably in some vector type, but probably high res picture, and get your cool shirt printed. Not even for designers who want to sell their clothes, but just for regular consumers. I understand that the sublimation process (that's what the whole-cloth printing style is called right? The sort of thing Threyda and VeryCoolShirtz use.) is a lot more difficult and costly and the economics for constant customisation can be pretty nightmarish (i.e sure enough it's easier to organise a print run of one design over 400 shirts than 400 shirts with a different design each).  Thanks for the offer! I'll have to play around in Illustrator and Photoshop a hell of a lot more before I can put something out that looks ok. But I'll hit you up then buddy!"

trippy,2il1ik,Jiberific,3,Tue Oct 7 19:02:07 2014 UTC,I smoke weed almost everyday maybe one or two off days a week.
trippy,2il1ik,Jiberific,4,Tue Oct 7 19:04:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah man, I smoke every day too, just maybe take a break from smoking til the visuals die down. If you're always high, then it could just be bringing out the visuals from your trip. Take a 2-4 day break and it'll prolly stop. Better safe than sorry dude"
trippy,2il1ik,Jiberific,3,Tue Oct 7 19:13:25 2014 UTC,"ahhh that sucks but i haven't smoked weed today and i've had quite bad visuals, and thank you for bringing HPPD to my attention, i don't have all the symptoms but i sometimes get tracers and thing seem to morph, weird note, i have actually had this before, after i did two tabs about a month ago i saw very faint visuals or nostalgia after smoking weed for a second of two i feels like i'm at my peak, hard to explain it only lasted for a week or two. also my friends have actually had this too, no idea why but all of us have had this now, not as bad as me tho."
trippy,2il1ik,Jiberific,5,Tue Oct 7 19:21:38 2014 UTC,"Maybe wait longer in between trips man. I try to trip on lsd at most 4 - 7 times a year. A month is a good gap, but it just might be good for you to wait a little longer til the next time you trip so that you have time to fully recover. Maybe take what you learned from your trip and apply it to yourself before going on another adventure with Lucy. It's always better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your mind and psyche. You'll want to have a stable mind for the rest of your life rather than having to deal with the consequences of tripping in your youth"
trippy,2il1ik,Jiberific,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:29:41 2014 UTC,"thank you for the advice, i don't intend to trip acid again. i'm not smoking weed for the rest of the week or until these visuals stop, any advice on mushrooms? currently we've just ordered a batch this will be my first time doing it, i'm taking 3.2g should i wait a month or two? i haven't done any research at all."
trippy,2il1ik,sFino,3,Tue Oct 7 19:35:57 2014 UTC,"Oh god, shrooms are intense as fuck. I personally prefer lsd, but start with a dose of 1.5-2 g's for your first trip, then move on up to around 3 grams once you're comfortable. Shrooms is all about set and setting and how comfortable you are with the people around you. I'd only recommend taking an eighth if you are completely comfortable with your environment. Shrooms will show you your emotional side and will teach you a lot about your body and how you feel on a day to day basis. I say shrooms have to do with the earth while lsd has to do with the universe. Only take them if you're looking to learn about yourself. Don't go into it looking for a fun time because that may not be what you get. Although everyone's experience varies and psychedelics affect everyone differently"
trippy,2il1ik,Professor_Pussypenis,2,Tue Oct 7 19:44:51 2014 UTC,"but i felt a sort of enlightenment from LSD, since then i've been a different person. kinda feel like i'm on a higher mental level after experiencing LSD if that makes sense, life is so much better and there is less stress, like it destroyed all the problems, don't know if you get this or not? but i prefer being alone on acid i feel people anchor me down and i don't trip as much, i have a drug councilor (i got arrested for possession of weed) she told me about how much people and setting can set your trip on a path i'm aware and i have never had a 'bad trip' or a panic attack yet, is mushrooms anything like LSD? in the way it looks/feels etc?"
trippy,2il1ik,Professor_Pussypenis,2,Tue Oct 7 19:53:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah man, that why I love lsd. I feel that it cleans your mind and allows you to get over simple things that are stopping you from being who you truly are. Im not exactly sure if id say that it brings out enlightenment, but it's  definitely is an important tool on getting there. Shrooms is like a Rollercoaster of emotions. I don't recommend doing it alone, but with someone who you completely trust and can talk unfiltered with. Like a best friend perhaps? It's a completely different experience from lsd as it feels less stable and is easier for you to get a bad trip. You just have to know that you control the trip and have the ability to change the setting/environment if things do get a little unsettling. Just enjoy yourself and prepare to learn and you should have an amazing experience"
trippy,2il1ik,skabossphil,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:07:37 2014 UTC,thank you so much for clearing some things up and i will 100% be  mindful of where when and who i'm doing mushrooms with. thanks again :)

trippy,2hxb5w,Synovexh001,1 point,Sun Oct 12 10:24:23 2014 UTC,"If you're a stickler about English (which I am), the subject of the sentence is in the nominative case regardless of being singular or plural.  It's a common mistake, but saying ""I and my gf"" would work fine, while what you have is technically the same as ""Me made this.""  Wow I can't believe I just wrote that all out.  Oh wow.  I feel bad now.  G-d, save me from the nothing I've become..."
trippy,2hxb5w,TheJoshy,2,Sun Oct 12 22:18:09 2014 UTC,you see my english is bad :D yes my gf and i made this :DD

trippy,2homsf,spirit_spine,1 point,Sun Sep 28 22:20:46 2014 UTC,"I make animated fractals or patterns, that I then use in resolume, a software dedicated to VJing. Inside that software you can do live video mixing and effects. You can also record the output to create new footage from old footage making the software good for VJing but also making VJing content."

trippy,2hebll,shortchangehero,2,Thu Sep 25 18:08:02 2014 UTC,I hope you put some details on your page about the medium and size and such!  This looks really nice and I want to know/see more.
trippy,2hebll,bmacc,2,Thu Sep 25 06:06:50 2014 UTC,You should check out my other posts on /r/Fractalporn  I have all the sizes listed there. Thanks for the feedback!
trippy,2hebll,GradysGhost,2,Thu Sep 25 06:16:57 2014 UTC,"I really like the understated, muted tones here. It's really unlike most fractal art with bright or high-contrast colors meant to make the shapes form up. The bleeding, deep tones make this feel more human and emotional."

trippy,2hbgeu,RoseTheChief,2,Thu Sep 25 01:57:21 2014 UTC,This could be a cool album cover.
