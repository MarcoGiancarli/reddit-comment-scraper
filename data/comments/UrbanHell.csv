I like to match a google location with some of these pictures, so the first thing I do is an image search and see if I can get a more specific location.  This picture has been around since at least 2008 and most references are to Camden.    That gave me a little more to go on and I found that in fact it was called Arlington Street in Camden, NJ.  This page can tell you all about the history of the street, but the interesting fact is that the entire street, which only consisted of this one block, was demolished in February of 2004.  Which is kind of funny, because it looks like it's been thrown around the internet in right wing groups as an example of the state of our cities."

There are so many single terraced houses left standing on their own due to neighbouring houses being demolished, and so much wasteland. There is the occasional street that seems relatively nice, but about 75% of the area I walked around was seriously awful.   I didn't actually realise places like this existed in one of the richest countries on earth. It's like a post-apocalyptic town.   EDIT: Actually, downtown Camden doesn't look too awful.

Density is so much better from an efficiency perspective than large lot suburbia.  There is so much less concrete and asphalt that has to be maintained per person and it's possible to run effective transit.    Phoenix, for example, has a mile of streets for every 311 people, Chicago, 680 (and Chicago isn't that dense).  Phoenix's road situation is a ticking time bomb--streets have an overlay cycle of 65 years in some cases, compared to an industry standard of 30.  $4 billion shortfall.  https://www.phoenix.gov/publictransitsite/Documents/Street%20Transportation%20101.pdf"

I think it's just the mind-boggling privilege involved in thinking semi-dense ""standard"" suburbia is even close to hell on earth. I can see why some people wouldn't like to live there (I mean, I probably wouldn't), but the living conditions in these suburbs are some of the best in the entire world.

Wind direction determines the runway in use (note: a single physical runway is actually two runways. One in either direction).

The road connects the industrial part of the city (and further on, Sarajevo Airport) to the Old Town's cultural and historic sites. The boulevard itself has many high-rise buildings giving sniper shooters extensive fields of fire.     Image i - Sniper Alley in 1996, seen from a Vehicle of the IFOR.

Checking the statistics, this still remains as one of the poorest places in New York City, but crime fell by about a third to a half. There's still violence and poverty, but because NYC is simply more gentrified and developed, it's falling.  I kinda like the idea of block housing/apartment buildings though. The problem with the apartment buildings and such tends to be related to the fact that a vast majority of wealthier people and people with kids would rather have their own suburban dwelling, as apartment buildings tend to be looked down as them all being low income undesirable housing, which isn't necessarily the case in other parts of the world where space needs to be conserved, etc. In my view, there's no reason as to why you can't have neighborhoods consisting of affordable apartments with all sorts of amenities and people of various income brackets all living amongst each other."

I like the incongruities in both quality and age of architecture that give cities their personalities.

Monitoring work is done by the oil sands companies themselves, though it was made clear to me that no one really trusts what they say.   The bulk of the research currently happening is quantifying effects (eg, tailings pond leakage rates) and how to remediate those effects. Of course, no one thought about how to ""restore"" the land once they were done with it, but as of right now they barely know how the land is reacting in the first place.   I did my honours thesis on restoration options for tailings ponds in the oil sands, so I know a little bit about the subject if anyone has questions."

There was an actual building and the bus pulled all the way up to the door, so they only way you were getting in was if you had already paid for a ticket and were in that building. It was a bit of of an eye-opener.  Now, my dad is a carpenter, and he used to have to travel through Gary to get to various jobs. Anywhere from two to four guys would carpool, and they would have their lunchboxes and tools in the back of their pickup trucks.

UrbanHell,337cod,Lollipop126,5,Sat May 9 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"As a Hong Konger, I must disagree with you. The double deckers are made so that people pay at the exits, so there's two stair cases, one at the back (next to entrance) and one at the front (next to exit).  This way the driver can monitor whether or not you pay. This means two walkways, converging at one door where you can pay. With double deckers, we also decrease the use of space, thereby decreasing traffic. Also, since you're not allowed to stand on the top deck, if you have the willpower to walk up the stairs (probably because you're going for more than a few stations), you get a) a nicer view, and b) a less stuffy environment, whereas if you're only getting on for a few stations you can stay on the bottom floor, which although is more stuffy due to the standing space and the sitting space, you a) get to get off the tram without a hassle, and b) accommodate more people with standing space.  Hong Kong is so densely packed with people, the most efficient way for public transit is to be small and still accommodate enough people, since we also have many many cars, even with arguably the second best transport system in the world (next to Tokyo of course).  Also, think about it like it's a bus, do you really think that a long bus is better than a compact bus in a city with such narrow streets and so many cars?"

Society is not there to perpetuate society, it's there to serve individuals.  They do put emphasis on collectivity, but it doesn't mean they will disrespect one person's choice because it's a minority.  That's a social concept I love about asia.

UrbanHell,32rb44,gregish,3,Thu Apr 16 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"Kinda depends on your interests, age what time you are there etc.  If the weather is nice probably the biggest tourist thing to do for a day in Baltimore if to come down to the Harbor, and maybe check out the aquarium which is a really nice facility.  Dolphins, sharks, tons of jellyfish, stingray touch tank and an octopus.  If you like sports catching an Orioles game at Camden Yards is always fun, not too expensive and its great ballpark which totally shifted the way new stadiums are built.  The stadium is walking distance from the harbor.  If art is more your thing the American Visionary Art Museum has some really interesting contemporary art displays.  There's a charge to get in but check groupon for discounts.  This is also by the harbor, and next to federal hill, which the hill has great views of downtown and the harbor for some pictures, and the federal hill neighborhood has some great restaurants and bars.  If you like history Fort McHenry is a free shuttle ride away from the harbor.  The site of the writing of the Star Spangled Banner during the war of 1812."

Predatory police and prosecuting habits contribute to a prison system that cycles in young black men at a time in their life that is most important in how their future works out. Instead of learning a trade or earning a degree they end up in jail learning 'the game' from other criminals. When they get out all they've learned is how to be a better criminal, and now have a rap sheet that makes finding legitimate employment difficult, forcing them to continue to provide for themselves the only way they know how, through crime.

I'm in no way stating that all ideologies in first world urban planning are a good thing; there are clearly important debates to be had. I just took umbrage with describing this sort of development as ""hell"".  Living in some of the poor projects in the US would definitely be difficult and unpleasant for many of us privileged first world people, but it's still not close to the misery of living in the sprawling slums of Mumbai. I guess my intuition is to reserve ""hell"" for the latter, due to the severity of the term. My concern is that describing the projects as ""hell"" (or the development posted by the OP) waters down the power of the term to the point where we could describe 90% of the populated world as ""hell"", which just seems nonsensical.   Essentially, if we want ""hell"" to mean anything, we shouldn't describe mildly unpleasant first world urban development as ""hell""."

UrbanHell,311yba,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl:       Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl (Spanish pronunciation: [sjuˈðað nesawalˈkoʝotɬ]), or more commonly Ciudad Neza, is a city and municipality of Mexico State adjacent to the northeast corner of Mexico's Federal District: it is thus part of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. It was named after Nezahualcoyotl, the Acolhua poet and king of nearby Texcoco, and was built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco. The name Nezahualcóyotl comes from Nahuatl, meaning ""fasting coyote.""    Until the 20th century, the land on which Ciudad Neza sits was under Lake Texcoco and uninhabited. Successful draining of the lake in the early 20th century created new land, which the government eventually sold into private hands. However, public services such as adequate potable water, electricity and sewerage were lacking until after the area was made an independent municipality in 1963.  Today Ciudad Neza is a sprawling city of over one million entirely with modern buildings.  As of 2006, Nezahualcóyotl included part of the world's largest mega-slum, along with Chalco and Izta.  Most of its population is poor  and have migrated from other parts of Mexico.  It also has a very high crime rate,  in part due to “cholos” or gangs formed since the 1990s based on gang models in the United States, especially Los Angeles.  Since the 2000s, a significant number of natives of this city have immigrated to the United States, mostly settling in New York. This has led to a new Mexican subculture in the area.

UrbanHell,30r9f9,that_nagger_guy,-4,Thu Apr 2 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"No it's not.   Oh really? You have first hand knowledge?   Just clicking on google maps completely disproves your statement.   How does that ""completely disprove my statement""? Like at all?   Why do people choose to be so ignorant when you have the internet at your fingertips?   It's exactly the Internet that has taught me how rough this place is. Some of the worst videos of the Internet are from the Chechen Wars where soldiers brutally beheads other soldiers. This is not a common thing in war. This is brutal, hence ""I still hold by that Chechnya is one of the roughest places on earth"". Get it?  Also you might want to use Wikipedia instead of Google Maps when gathering information about a place.   On September 1, 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes ""anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man"". For first- and second-time offenders, the punishment is caning. A third conviction leads to the death penalty, which can be carried out in a number of ways including stoning or beheading   Stoning or beheading for having sex. This is the kinds of things that ISIS are doing. ISIS and Chechnya. But naah, Chechnya is totally not rough at all. It is a paradise.   On March 10, 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that since Chechenization, the government has pushed for enforced Islamic dress code and other traditions which violently repress women.[99] The president Ramzan Kadyrov is quoted as saying ""I have the right to criticize my wife. She doesn’t. With us [in Chechen society], a wife is a housewife. A woman should know her place. A woman should give her love to us [men]... She would be [man’s] property. And the man is the owner. Here, if a woman does not behave properly, her husband, father, and brother are responsible. According to our tradition, if a woman fools around, her family members kill her... That’s how it happens, a brother kills his sister or a husband kills his wife... As a president, I cannot allow for them to kill. So, let women not wear shorts..."".[100] He has also openly defended honour killings on several occasions.[101]"
UrbanHell,30r9f9,banananinja2,8,Thu Apr 2 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"Half of your post is about the Chechen wars, which is the Chechnya of the past. If you think that Chechnya still IS a hell on Earth, you are using the present tense. Yeah, its a conservative Islamic republic, of course they have harsh laws and conservative views, but its better than in a lot of other Islamic Nations. My brother works in Chechnya often, women can wear whatever clothes they want, she might get weird looks because they are big on cultural revival and national identity. The death penalty is illegal in the Russian Federation, therefore there can be no such thing as stoning or beheading. It happened in the 90's, not now (or at least govt isn't doing it, Islamic insurgents might). Here is the thing, quoting the criminal code from 1997 is pointless, because it no longer applies today. The Chechen-Ichkeria republic has been liquidated in 2007, and Chechnya now follows most laws of the Russian Federation, with some exceptions for local customs such as dress and whatever. Basically, you have your timelines all messed up. The Chechen wars happened in the 90's, throughout this time Chechnya was practically independent, hence these laws. After reestablishing order, RF law was established as the chief ruling body. I don't have first-hand experience, but my family members have told me that the region seems calm. They said the people were very nice and they were well-treated. I can't really back these words up, but its still their experience from the Chechnya of 2014. Honestly, Wikipedia is very often outdated and outright inaccurate, much like Western media in general when talking about the Russian Federation. Shame."

I never said Chechnya and Russia was paradise on Earth, but you seem to not be able to understand that Chechnya has changed and is no longer in a state of war. Yes, human rights violations occur. Yes, Russian law is not perfect, or at least its enforcement. BUT, general quality of life in Chechnya is some of the highest in the region, they live a relatively calm and peaceful existence. I am NOT Chechen, and I do not particularly like Chechens anyway, nor am I fond of Muslim laws, but to claim ""Hell on Earth"" is absolutely fucking ridiculous. You refuse to read anything I write, and keep referring back to one Wikipedia article where the source of the quote you provided doesn't even exist anymore. In terms of media, Western World is not the Whole World, and I have lived in the USA for several years, Americans do not understand RF at all. Judging from EU news, they don't either.

It's just that you seem to be hyper-patriotic about Mother Russia.   but you seem to not be able to understand that Chechnya has changed and is no longer in a state of war.   I never said it was in war. I said that when the war was going on, atrocities that were extremely brutal were carried out.   BUT, general quality of life in Chechnya is some of the highest in the region, they live a relatively calm and peaceful existence.    Unless you are a gay or a woman. But then again Chechnya is in Russia and gay people are also discriminated against in Russia. It's not really Chechnya's fault.   but to claim ""Hell on Earth"" is absolutely fucking ridiculous   It is just a saying. I don't mean that Satan is literally impaling people on his trident in Chechnya. I just mean that if you aren't a straight male there you are doomed.   You refuse to read anything I write   I read all you wrote.  Here is a page I read a long time ago. Under one image it says that if a boy and a girl have sex, there is a high chance that she will get killed by her own family. There are young girls being forced into marriages by their families.  I think this is rough. Honer killings are rough, and when the President of a country is an advocate for honor killings, I think it is pretty safe to say it's a rough country. I guess that's the difference between me and you. You are Russian and you have grown up with a different world view than me. It's okay to hate and discriminate gay people in Russia for example. In my country it is not. So I view Chechnya as a really rough place, but you do not. It is fine to have different opinions."

UrbanHell,307so2,Skid_Marx,10,Wed Mar 25 17:00:58 2015 UTC,The rules here are that the parks need to be within walking distance of the neighborhood they serve. You're not going to want to lug your kids or baby into a car every time you want to go for a stroll to the park.
UrbanHell,307so2,pancakeonmyhead,23,Wed Mar 25 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has said this yet: It's unsustainable. Having a population like that in the middle of the freakin' desert is totally fucked up. It violates the basic rule of Biology 101: Where there is water, there is life.  There's been so much growth all over the Southwest, much of it exurban, and it puts a big strain on the environment. This development isn't as bad as some others, with their swimming pools and giant lawns, but it's still very clear that people aren't supposed to live there -- and yet they still keep on building the damn things.

UrbanHell,307so2,try_____another,3,Wed Mar 25 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"I agree it's not so bad. Things people seem to hate about it are:   The yards are too small - but that just means there's less sprawl than a typical suburb. You have to drive to get anywhere - welcome to the suburbs just about anywhere. But in this case these houses are 3 miles, or < 10 minutes' drive, to a grocery store. Lack of trees and green - welcome to the desert Uniformity of houses - most developments are like this. It's more noticeable when the houses are closer together.   If you're against sprawl and auto-dominated development, you could find much, much worse pretty much anywhere in the SE USA. Like just about all of suburban Tennessee. Very spread out, and you have to drive 5 miles to get anywhere. But since those developments have lots of trees and 1-acre lawns, people in this sub wouldn't call it ""urban hell"".

Interestingly, if left uncovered these are breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit Dengue Fever."
UrbanHell,2ysdln,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 11 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Transmission of article  Dengue fever:       Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly A. aegypti.  These mosquitoes usually live between the latitudes of 35° North and 35° South below an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft).  They typically bite during the day, particularly in the early morning and in the evening,   but they are able to bite and thus spread infection at any time of day all during the year.  Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis and A. scutellaris.  Humans are the primary host of the virus,   but it also circulates in nonhuman primates.  An infection can be acquired via a single bite.  A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2–10 day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut.  About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life.  Aedes aegypti is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.

I'm sure it could be very different for others, but for me, living in a refurbished broom closet meant I had a place to sleep off a hangover, throw takeout in a mini fridge, and store my clothes under the bunk bed (roommate took the makeshift closet).

When jet travel happened from about 1960 onwards, people from the Philly & NYC areas started going elsewhere on vacation, and AC started going in the tank.  The legalization of gambling in the 1970s was a desperate attempt to bring tourism back to the city and make AC the ""Vegas of the East"".  It succeeded, for a while.  But even in the heyday of gambling in AC in the '80s and '90s, the benefits of the tourism economy didn't trickle down (where have we heard that before?) to its poorer residents.  And when Native American-run casinos started opening up elsewhere, that was it.  AC is now once more circling the drain."

This venture failed  miserably for many reasons - most notably, the expansion of the gaming industry outside Las Vegas & Atlantic City.   Atlantic City used to be the gaming destination for Philadelphians & New Yorkers back in the day. That is, until Pennsylvania loosened its gaming laws and Foxwoods Casino (Indian Casino in Connecticut) was built.   The Philly metro area now has multiple casinos (Casino #1, Casino #2) that are upscale & classy where people can game without driving outside the city. New Yorkers can go to Foxwoods in a much nicer area. I've heard magazines listing Foxwoods as the nicest Indian casino in America.   Basically, this is the result of ""putting lipstick on a pig"". Revel was meant to spark the AC economy, where it really just dug a bigger hole for itself.  EDIT: pictures, grammar, stuff"
UrbanHell,2uxbeh,popmurtha,9,Fri Feb 6 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"While all the aspects you listed are accurate to the failings of AC, Revel itself suffered more from their own poor decisions.  They didn't comp players, their poker set up and comps were inferior to the Borgata, they were super overpriced (Vegas prices at the north end of AC), club cover was $40, drinks in the $20 range, restaurants where you'd pay at least $100 a person... Great if you are still attracking the upscale NYC crowd, but that doesn't work with lower-middle class South Jersey and Philly.   With all that they couldn't attract the slots players (too expensive, no comps), the poker players (Borgata comps better), the bachelor/bachelorette party crowd (too expensive for rooms, clubs, and drinks), so who is left?  I did have my bachelor party there and it was awesome.  The place was incredible, but damn was it expensive.  Also the rooms where all dirty upon check-in.

Revel was the northernmost casino on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, located on 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land, adjacent to the Showboat Hotel & Casino. Revel opened on April 2, 2012, and became the third of four casinos in 2014 which closed on September 2, 2014 after declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time. Later that month, on September 11, 2014, the casino reached a deal to sell itself to a developer based in Florida – Polo North Country Club - for a fee of $90 million. However, plans fell though and Revel was sold at the September 30, 2014 auction to Brookfield Asset Management for $110 million. However Brookfield Management backed-out of this deal on November 19, 2014. On January 8th 2015, Gleen Straub announced he wanted to build the largest water park in the world with the former Revel building. Also he announced he want to have a high speed ferry from New York City to The Resort. There is no reopen date set yet.

Usually if we want to go to a casino, we usually go to Foxwoods which in Connecticut.  Hurricane Sandy also did a number. The boardwalk got pretty fucked up.

I filmed these panoramas from the building in May 2014, four months before the resort closed.  The city from three directions, 300 feet above the ground. Note how this is less than half the building's height, yet it already puts you level with the tops of most of the other hotels on the skyline.  Panorama from the top of the hotel, 650 feet above the ground. I was lucky that I had this unique observatory experience before it was gone.  A high zoom pano across the Steel Pier amusement park.

After WW2 China claimed the Walled City as theirs, the British failed to remove the settlers. So it became this lawless place, with the British unwilling to allow the Chinese access to enforce their laws.

Climate of article  Yakutsk:       With an extreme subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfd), Yakutsk has the coldest winter temperatures for any city.  Average monthly temperatures range from +19.5 °C (67.1 °F) in July to −38.6 °C (−37.5 °F) in January, and only Norilsk has a lower mean annual temperature for any settlement of over 100,000. [citation needed]  The coldest temperatures ever recorded on the planet outside Antarctica occurred in the basin of the Yana River to the northeast of Yakutsk. Although winters are long and extremely cold, summers are warm (though rather short), with daily maximum temperatures occasionally exceeding +30 °C (86 °F),  making the seasonal temperature differences for the region among the greatest in the world. The lowest temperature recorded in Yakutsk was −64.4 °C (−83.9 °F) and the highest was +38.4 °C (101.1 °F). Yakutsk is the biggest city built on continuous permafrost, and most houses there are built on concrete piles.  Yakutsk has a distinct inland location, being almost 1000 kilometres from the Pacific Ocean, which coupled with the high latitude means exposure to severe winters and also lack of temperature moderation, which sees July temperatures soar to an above-normal average for this parallel, with the July average being comparable to summer temperatures in Trondheim, Melhus, Bergen, Utsira, Stavanger and average is warmer than the Los Angeles coastline.

Anderson Freeway) – El Segundo, LAX Airport, Norwalk I‑110 (Harbor Freeway) – San Pedro, Los Angeles   Though the interchange permits traffic entering the interchange in all directions to exit in all directions (cf. Hollywood Split, East Los Angeles Interchange), the interchange also consists of direct HOV connectors, Metro Green Line tracks, and the Harbor Transitway, all of which contribute to the towering, imposing structure for which the interchange is known.  Opened with Interstate 105 in 1993, the interchange is named for Harry Pregerson, a longtime federal judge who presided over the lawsuit concerning the I-105 freeway's construction.

It's so straightforward and simple to use that I could get there without a map if I wanted and all for the meagre cost of some gas and a few tolls stateside.   The amount of money and engineering that went into making that possible is staggering and yet we look at those highways like they're nothing or worse, an eyesore.

UrbanHell,2qfysk,Dildo-_baggins,0,Sat Dec 27 10:17:47 2014 UTC,"Economy of the United Arab Emirates:       The economy of the United Arab Emirates is the second largest in the Arab world (after Saudi Arabia), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $377 billion (AED1.38 trillion) in 2012. The United Arab Emirates has been successfully diversifying its economy. 71% of UAE's total GDP comes from non-oil sectors.   Although UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009.   While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy.  In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.   Dubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007-2010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi's oil wealth. Dubai's current prosperity has been attributed to Abu Dhabi's petrodollars.  Dubai is currently in extreme debt.  Tourism is one of the main sources of revenue in the UAE, with some of the world's most luxurious hotels being based in the UAE. Although the UAE is now less dependent on natural resources as a source of revenue, petroleum and natural gas exports still play an important role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. A massive construction boom, an expanding manufacturing base, and a thriving services sector are helping the UAE diversify its economy. Nationwide, there is currently $350 billion worth of active construction projects.

UrbanHell,2onc38,combuchan,15,Tue Dec 9 05:52:53 2014 UTC,"The thing I've noticed about moving from a bland suburb to an actual city is that the outward appearance of where you live might suck, but inside, it's the same walls and floors that are found practically anywhere else.

UrbanHell,2onc38,jerjack,-3,Mon Dec 8 23:24:58 2014 UTC,"I dont live in a place like NYC where people can live without a car and rely solely on public transit... I also dont know how easy it would be to live here while relying on public transit...  What I do know is the streets look like they were designed to accommodate a large amount of traffic and there is a major highway with many on/off ramps right next to the complex... So that tells me a large number of people own cars.    If a large number of people own cars that tells me not everything is accessible with public transit.  Now this is an assumption and I could be wrong but the fact the place looks engineered for vehicle traffic is what gives me that assumption.    I live in a place with a great bus line but I still would never consider taking it simply because it is too inconvenient... heck it takes me 15 -20 minutes to drive to the grocery store on a good day... it would be an all day excursion with public transit, not to mention trying to haul $200 worth of groceries on a bus.   Just because a subway is available doesnt mean its convenient or efficient to use."
UrbanHell,2onc38,rkgkseh,6,Mon Dec 8 23:57:50 2014 UTC,"Just because a subway is available doesnt mean its convenient or efficient to use.   I don't understand this statement.  The subway is geographically close to the apartment complexes and everything I know about grade-separated rail systems says they're much faster than surface traffic in rush hour--and that presumes you're taking the subway regularly.  As I mentioned earlier, this neighborhood is already in a multicultural/financial district where many of one's needs such as working and shopping would be met within easy walking distance, and if you didn't work in the neighborhood the subway would take you out (or driving for that matter) for a reverse commute.   What I do know is the streets look like they were designed to accommodate a large amount of traffic and there is a major highway with many on/off ramps right next to the complex... So that tells me a large number of people own cars.   LeCorbusierian nightmares are frequently like this--I live in one myself in San Francisco (Arballo Dr, Parkmerced) that has a bunch of towers and parking lots and grassy areas and courtyards with much less than the average density of a suburban apartment complex--but that doesn't mean the rest of the city is inaccessible.  I can walk to a light rail line and I'm close enough to BART.  And for the density of this particular complex, there's not nearly enough parking at a 1 space:1 unit suburban ratio for all that live here so it's almost guaranteed that this is a transit-dependent neighborhood.    If a large number of people own cars that tells me not everything is accessible with public transit. Now this is an assumption and I could be wrong but the fact the place looks engineered for vehicle traffic is what gives me that assumption.   Just because things aren't built to the street with no cars parked anywhere doesn't mean that it's inaccessible to transit.  It's close enough that you can probably walk to shopping and take a cab/Uber back with your groceries like a lot of people do in central cities.   I live in a place with a great bus line but I still would never consider taking it simply because it is too inconvenient... heck it takes me 15 -20 minutes to drive to the grocery store on a good day... it would be an all day excursion with public transit, not to mention trying to haul $200 worth of groceries on a bus.   That's ... not where this place is.  I don't see shopping a 20 minute drive from here.  A 20 minute walk, at most, maybe, and altho I haven't delved into the bus in this neighborhood I highly doubt it's an ""all day excursion"".    You shouldn't confuse your suburbia with a dense, dynamic neighborhood where people have other options than carrying $200 worth of groceries by hand all day long."
UrbanHell,2onc38,vanzetti1,2,Tue Dec 9 01:00:41 2014 UTC,"Just because a subway is available doesnt mean its convenient or efficient to use.   Actually the Seoul Subway is regarded as one of the easiest to use subways in the world, even for non-Korean speakers.  Not to mention in Seoul, you don't even need to use mass transit most of the time to go to the grocery store, it's all within walking distance.  One of the things I miss most about Korea is how efficient the mass transit system was.  I wish Amtrak worked even half as efficiently as Korail."
UrbanHell,2onc38,RedShirtDecoy,3,Tue Dec 30 03:42:10 2014 UTC,Spent a month in travelling across the country. Korea really does have an incredibly well made public transportation system (even in the countryside). Never felt a need for a car.

UrbanHell,2onc38,Skid_Marx,2,Mon Dec 8 16:51:40 2014 UTC,"I hear you and respectfully disagree. I flew into Seoul and flew over neighborhoods like this and literally thought for a second that I was flying over a shipping yard with trucks all lined up. I've never seen anything on the kind of scale they have there. That being said, these really are pleasant places and seoul is a very transit friendly and nature oriented city. I think this points to the conclusion that ""corbusian nightmares"" weren't so much an architectural failure as a policy failure. There's a lot more to what made these kind of projects fail than just repetition. Check out the Pruitt Igoe myth for a taste"
UrbanHell,2onc38,Moarbrains,10,Tue Dec 9 05:59:46 2014 UTC,"If this is anything like the apartment towers in Toronto, that green space between the buildings is worthless. It's a place for people to cut through on their way to the bus. There's no shops on the ground floor and no street life. The streets are too wide to be comfortable as a pedestrian.  It's worse than a denser city with buildings packed together, and worse than a suburb/town where people have private green space. It's an uncomfortable post-war compromise between being higher density and car-oriented."
UrbanHell,2onc38,vanzetti1,2,Mon Dec 8 21:08:45 2014 UTC,"Those trees look like they're planted in small mounds of dirt between parking spaces.   Coming from Europe I'm a little surprised you don't have small shops or cafes on the ground floor. It seems like an obvious move, the cafes will hardly bother anyone if they close by a reasonable hour."
UrbanHell,2onc38,nametheoccupation,3,Mon Dec 8 22:24:08 2014 UTC,"These kinds of buildings (at least in Canada) don't have an entrance on the street. They are surrounded by a parking lot and/or the semi-private green space I was talking about above. They were built between the 1950s and 1980s, when the planning wisdom was to separate uses - residential buildings are for residences only - and they're often on minor streets like cul-de-sacs so they don't get a lot of pedestrians passing by.  Downtowns/older areas always had mixed-use buildings, and thankfully we're starting to build them again in new areas too."

UrbanHell,2mb5zx,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Nov 15 00:55:02 2014 UTC,"Bijlmermeer:       The Bijlmermeer (pronounced [bɛilmərmeːr]) or colloquially Bijlmer ([bɛilmər]) is one of the neighbourhoods that form the Amsterdam Zuidoost ('Amsterdam South-East') borough (or ""stadsdeel"") of Amsterdam, Netherlands. To many people, the Bijlmer designation is used to refer to Amsterdam Zuidoost and Diemen Zuid as a pars pro toto. The other neighbourhoods in Amsterdam Zuidoost are Gaasperdam, Bullewijk, Venserpolder and Driemond.  The Bijlmermeer neighbourhood, which today houses almost 100,000 people of over 150 nationalities, was designed as a single project. The original neighbourhood was designed as a series of nearly identical high-rise buildings laid out in a hexagonal grid. The apartments were meant to attract a suburban set, rather like condominium housing. The buildings have several features that distinguish them from traditional Dutch high-rise flats, such as tubular walkways connecting the flats and garages. The blocks are separated by large green areas planted with grass and trees. Each flat has its own garages where cars can be parked.  The Bijlmer was designed with two levels of traffic. Cars drive on the top level, the decks of which fly over the lower level's pedestrian avenues and bicycle paths. This separation of fast and slow moving traffic is beneficial to traffic safety. However, in recent years, the roads are once again being flattened, so pedestrians, cycles and cars travel alongside each other. This is a move to lessen the effects of the 'inhuman' scale of some of the Bijlmer's designs. It is felt a direct line of sight will also improve safety from muggers.

From the Wikipedia article on Pruitt-Igoe...   ...one of the residency requirements was that the male head of household could not occupy the premises. A resident reported that she and her husband decided that he would leave so that she and their 12 children could occupy the premises. Sometimes the men would return at night and hide in the closet. Children were told not to tell any white people visiting that their father lived on the premises. Televisions and telephones were not allowed in the apartments.   With policies like that, it was doomed before the first foundation was poured."
UrbanHell,2lz08m,doctorsound,10,Wed Nov 12 00:31:32 2014 UTC,"Funny thing is, St. Louis still has eerily similar laws.   Occupancy permits are just one of the myriad ways in which these municipalities can sap funds from poor people. Basically, if you live in St. Louis County, you’re required to get one for your residents. It doesn’t matter if you rent or own. The police can then periodically make compliance checks (although generally they conduct these checks after they’ve been called to a residence for another reason, like a noise complaint or domestic dispute). If there are more people in your place than your permit allows, they can fine you and each person in your home. Attorneys I spoke to say the regulation can end up being a way to enforce antiquated local laws against unmarried cohabitation, and judging by comments you sometimes hear in courtrooms or from local officials, a way for police and prosecutors to essentially fine people for having premarital sex. You can probably guess which communities are most likely to be subjected to these occupancy inspections.   source  I wish I could find the other story I've seen on this, but there's even been stories of officers examining the underwear drawers of citizens to ""catch"" SOs staying over without occupancy permit."

Tabriz is located in a valley to the north of the long ridge of the volcanic cone of Sahand, south of the Eynali mountain. The valley opens out into a plain that slopes gently down to the north eastern end of Lake Urmia, 60 kilometres (37 miles) to the west. With cold winters and temperate summers the city is considered a summer resort.

It served as a museum about his legacy, but after 1991 became a conference center and exhibition venue. Some sources have referred to it as the ""Enver Hoxha Mausoleum"" although this was not an official appellation.

UrbanHell,29y3s1,The7thNomad,9,Sat Jul 12 18:18:54 2014 UTC,"The first two times I went in 2010/2011, the pollution wasn't too bad, especially next to Beijing, which, unlike the imgur comments of Shanghai, truly makes you think of Mordor.  But for my most recent trip in 2012-2013 (the 6 month stay), the pollution was much worse, a bit closer to Beijing. The only occasional saving grace was living near the coast and having the winds shuffle around the pollution a bit - some days would be really clear because of this.  TL:DR; you learn how to take really short breaths without breathing in too much of the dust. Some days you can see the dust in the air, and some days it's like it never existed."
UrbanHell,29y3s1,eyes_on_the_sky,7,Sun Jul 13 03:57:29 2014 UTC,"I've been, pollution really is that bad. When you step out of the airport in China you'll instantly feel inadequate at breathing, like you can't take a full deep breath. You may have a sore throat for several days while you're adjusting. After that it's okay to breathe but you can still sort of feel the grime in the air, it's difficult to explain but it's like instead of just being hot and muggy it's hot and muggy and dirty, and so your skin is never quite clean the entire time you're there. The smog seems to keep the heat in and so it just feels like a hot blanket of grime sitting on your skin and clothes. And the traffic is hell.  But I still love it and would go back to China in a second. I want to move to a smaller city with a bit less pollution, you can still feel it there but it's not as bad as Shanghai/Beijing."
UrbanHell,29y3s1,AGoodIntentionedFool,7,Sat Jul 12 19:29:02 2014 UTC,"""Hot, muggy and dirty""  No need to explain, I spent probably half of the last 72 hours working on my motorcycle, so if it's anything like that, being covered in a light layer of first in a closed space, I can understand just fine.  I feel like the Chinese had a great opportunity to build well planned mega cities and they blew it. In and around the skyscrapers should be public green spaces, not only to help with congestion, but also to help alleviate the smog."
UrbanHell,29y3s1,SinkHoleDeMayo,8,Sat Jul 12 20:30:08 2014 UTC,"The Chinese have done this in many places, if you look across the river to Pudong you'll notice wider boulevards, greater numbers of public parks, and wider bike lanes. The new urban plan in China seems to be a series of 30 story apartment blocks hemmed in by parks and green spaces. The temptation to build easily accessible services like shopping, grocery stores, and commonly needed services though can create a mess though as the residents seem to find common cause with American suburbanites in taking their cars from the subterranean parking deck just down the street and outside the walled compound for a jug of milk and some baked goods."

They might shave some of the workers off in factories as they mechanize, but those mega-cities are here to stay. Meaning pollution is only going to get worse and worse..."

Me and my wife ended up sleeping in our car in the parking lot of a Walmart in Anthem, Arizona that night.

I've walked between the buildings at sunset, but I never really took notice. The second time I went there, there was some guy banging a hooker behind one of the buildings so we stayed along the edge of the complex. I've never really gotten a chance to extensively look around outside of the buildings.  The first time I went, I gathered that all of the manholes are open and I didn't notice any doors or windows punched out, which means everyone goes into the sewer system and possibly goes into the buildings that way. This time I went, I heard voices in the manhole, so I knew that there were people around. I made it quick, but I didn't feel threatened due to the limited access people have to me if they're in the sewers."

Neighborhoods like this are often in flux, going up or down the scale of prosperity, and might have a decent real estate/accountant/lawyer's office, or successful clothing store, next to a boarded up house.  It could belong to such a firm/store.  Or it could belong to a funeral home on the block.  Or it could be there because of a wedding.  Or prom.  Or just a very special date of some other kind.  Our local airport has low-cost limos to supplement the taxis; it could be dropping someone off.  Or it could just be passing through the neighborhood.  Or maybe someone there runs or works for a party limo service.  A house around the block from me often has a taxi limo parked there, because the driver works for a service that gives cheap or free shuttle rides to and from select local restaurants (none of which are pricey).  Maybe someone is out to impress a client (or a date), and sprung to rent a limo for the day.  Maybe someone buys run-down cars, fixes them up, and resells them for profit, and this is one of their current projects.  Or maybe someone there just owns the limo--either because they ride in it, or because they make a living driving it.  In short, while it's not a common sight (and while you might be right), there's a lot of very reasonable, very legal reasons to see a limo in a bad neighborhood.  To decide it has to be someone ""illegally important"" is a big jump.  I hope you'll reconsider that conclusion."
UrbanHell,20a5o8,baklazhan,3,Fri Mar 14 04:15:22 2014 UTC,Limos aren't that expensive. I'm guessing it's a guy who bought a fifteen-year-old limo for a good price and is trying to make money working for either a limo-hire company or for himself.

Maybe the wet part is for unreinforced concrete, but arguably that part is now constantly wet so it should be okay, although rusting reinforcement could be a problem.

In the year 1967 [seen in the eyes of one of the PK tags] the riots broke out in Newark that sent it rocketing into poverty. Yes, it was crime-ridden before, but the riots are what finally caused the king to kick the bucket, becoming forever poor.  Poor Kingz writes short, symbolic phrases around their tags. Such as 1x1=0 and 2+2=4 - the equation is like society - it is not right, and must be corrected. All of the phrases have to do with poverty.

Most nuclear plants in the US actually don't have cooling towers. Around 2/3rds of them directly draw and discharge water to a lake or river, and as such, have no need for cooling towers."
UrbanHell,1s95z6,Hiddencamper,4,Fri Dec 6 22:37:35 2013 UTC,I imagine Three Mile Island and The Simpsons are why people think cooling tower = nuclear.

UrbanHell,1s95z6,XedtheRed,1 point,Mon May 12 06:21:39 2014 UTC,You can get close yes but security is pretty tight with the nuclear places. The last time I was at one of the nuclear facilities to see him (about 5 years ago) there were armed guards every so many feet patrolling a razor wire fence.  Edit: Unclaimed baggage store is sweet as hell. Get some damn good deals there. We got a DSLR camera with all the lenses and the works for like $50 once.

UrbanHell,1s4loz,SomalianRoadBuilder,6,Sat Dec 28 21:12:25 2013 UTC,"I think its to prevent flooding when it rains, so I think they don't let it be a public graffiti area because of the risk of people drowning on a rainy day."

As long as you had work and didn't have to commute ridiculous distances, I can't understand why it's so dead. Although I guess finding places to buy your groceries et cetera would be a pain."

Such a pity as it looks like a quintessential ""middle America"" town (to a non-American anyway...), lots of nice buildings and evocative storefronts, avenues etc. and not a single person there. But looking on a map where Cairo is just reminds me how big and open America is and how many places like this can just get completely left behind. Thanks for the pictures Dan, even if they were a little sad."
