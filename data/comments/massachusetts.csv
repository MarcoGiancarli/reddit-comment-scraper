It seems the MA Heat Loan program won't cover a central air unit because it doesn't meet their efficiency standards.  Unfortunately, the equipment they will help finance (ductless mini splits for example) is more expensive than a few quotes we've received doing a full central air install including all ductwork.    So are faced with:  1.) More expensive AC and 0% financing. 2.) Less expensive central air/ductwork, but will have to scrape the cash together."

That sounds like a free pass for eternity then, right? Anyone else read it as that?   Freeing the MBTA from the provisions of the Pacheco law, which requires a formal vetting process before outsourcing of state services, was one recommendation of a task force Baker assembled following the T's troubles last winter.   That sounds incredibly sketchy. What would they have to hide form a ""formal vetting process?""  I don't know much about the Pacheco Law, so here's some info I found:  The Law Itself: https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter7/Section52  AFL/CIO Opinion: http://workingmass.org/privatization-real-story  Contrasting Opinion In Globe: http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2011/01/07/pacheco_law_blocks_contracting_drives_up_cost_of_government/  From what I'm reading, The Pacheco Law seems like a reasonable check to make sure privatization doesn't cost jobs or provide worse service than state run services. I'm sure parts of it are redundant and will become obsolete in the future, but I'm not quite sure why it's a hurdle companies can't overcome pretty easily. It just sounds like they'd rather not have the hassle.  What does everyone else think? I'd like to think the State could upgrade the MBTA itself, but Baker's not that kind of Gov., nor do I know enough about the MBTA to know whether that'd feasible. It certainly needs some help though."
massachusetts,3dngfs,ChucklesOHoolihan,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"I worked for the state for awhile, before leaving to work in NH. Forgive me for being short as I am on mobile but the Pacheco law is extremely biased towards unions. How biased? Senator Pacheco, who the law is based on argued against it due to waste. Unions are fine, but this law needs readjustment and this was known for years. Currently the Pacheco law means an administration needs to prove absolutely that a private alternative would be better than the union. So the MBTA wants to install say, automatic turnstiles for the purple line. That means the administration of the MBTA needs to prove a turnstile company would do  the project for cheaper than the union, though common sense says a company with expertise in that would as the unions don't."
massachusetts,3dngfs,7573,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thank you for the informative reply. While I agree that ""common sense says a company with expertise in that would [do the project cheaper than the union]"" (if I'm interpreting that correctly) it does not mean common sense will prevail. I don't know enough about negotiations and bidding to guess as to what's required before a contract is given, but I imagine asking for projected finances is pretty standard. If they can't do it cheaper than the unions, then why not go with the cheaper unions? Then, I suppose, we would have to debate about union project quality vs. non union.  As with most aging laws, readjustment is probably the right move, I agree.  However, I couldn't find Senator Pacheco arguing against it. In these two articles he seems to continue to believe in it: http://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/with-pecheco-law-its-all-about-the-narrative/   The Taunton lawmaker refers to the statute as the “Taxpayer Protection Act,” insisting that it guards against ill-considered private contracting that may not deliver on its promised savings. But the view that has taken hold sees the law instead as an “anti-privatization” scheme, an overly union-friendly measure that stands in the way of more efficient delivery of transit services. The argument was probably helped along by Baker’s liberal-leaning transportation secretary, Stephanie Pollack, backing the governor in saying more flexibility would not be used to drive a stake through the heart of the T’s union workforce, but could instead help the cash-strapped agency make things like late-night bus service more financially viable.  “They’ve been very good at getting that narrative out there,” Pacheco said last month about the “anti-privatization” characterization of the law. As it was becoming clear that his prized legislation was in the budget negotiation cross hairs, Pacheco mounted a spirited defense.   http://www.lowellsun.com/opinion/ci_28143029/   ... the Pacheco Law, which, some say, hampers the state's ability to contract private companies for services.  Pacheco, a veteran lawmaker from Taunton, is not one of them.  ""The Taxpayer Protection Act,"" Pacheco said, using the official name of the law, ""has been a success. It has saved taxpayers millions of dollars. It is called the Taxpayer Protection Act because that is what it does. It protects the Massachusetts taxpayer.""   Kinda interesting. Can't believe I never heard about this law until now."

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:   SECTION 1.   Clause twenty-sixth of section 7 of chapter 4 of the General Laws is hereby amended after the word “characteristics,” by adding the following:-  “…including public record information which may be separately retrieved from an electronic record,”  SECTION 2.   Chapter 66 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after section 3A the following new section:-  “Section 3B. When designing or acquiring an electronic recordkeeping system or database, any person having custody of a public record shall ensure that such system or database is capable of providing data in a common format such as, but not limited to, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange or the Uniform Character Set Transformation Format.   When records maintained electronically include both public record information and exempt information that may be withheld from public inspection, the custodian shall design its information storage and retrieval methods in a manner that permits the segregation and retrieval of public record information and redacting of exempt information in order to provide maximum public access.   No custodian of a public record may enter into a contract for the storage of electronic records containing public record information that impairs or restricts public access to those records.”    SECTION 3.   Said Chapter 66 is hereby amended by inserting after section 6 the following new section:-   “Section 6A. Every state agency, as defined in chapter 66A, shall designate one or more employees as records access officers.   In a city or town, the city or town clerk, or their designee(s), and any such designees of individual municipal agencies or other entities that the chief executive of the municipality may select, shall serve as the records access officer(s).    Each agency, city or town shall publicize by posting in a conspicuous location at its offices and in a conspicuous location on its website, if any, the name, title, business address, business telephone number, and email address of the designated records access officers.   The designation of one or more records access officers shall not be construed to prohibit employees who have in the past been authorized to make records or information available to the public from continuing to do so.   Records access officers shall be responsible for coordinating such agency’s or governmental body’s response to requests for access to records under the provisions of this chapter, shall facilitate the informal resolution of requests by timely and thorough production of records, and shall ensure that the agency:   (a) assists requesters seeking records to identify the records sought;   (b) indicates, when responding to a request, whether the records are available in electronic form and the manner in which the records are stored, filed, retrieved or generated, to assist requesters in describing the records sought;   (c) contacts requesters when the response to a request would be voluminous so the agency may, at the option of the requester, assist the requester to modify the scope of the request or the timeframe for compliance;    (d) coordinates with the Supervisor of Public Records and the Records Management Unit to ensure that public records are preserved in accordance with relevant Massachusetts law, regulation, and administrative guidance; and   (e) prepares and maintains reference materials to enhance access to electronic public records in its custody and enable requestors to make informed requests.   These reference materials shall be updated at least annually and shall include:    (i) a reasonably detailed list of categories of records maintained by the agency, whether or not open for public inspection;    (ii) a list and description of all major databases maintained by the agency; and    (iii) a record of all public records requests received on or after October 1, 2016 and the responses to those requests, to the extent that such responses may be preserved in electronic form.   Each state agency that maintains a website shall post these reference materials on its website.”"

massachusetts,3dk0u1,Manitcor,0,Fri Jul 17 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"SECTION 4.    Section 10 of chapter 66 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking subsections (a) and (b) and inserting the following:--    “(a) Every person having custody of any public record, as defined in clause twenty-sixth of section seven of chapter four, shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any portion of a record which is an independent public record, including public record information which may be separately retrieved from an electronic record, to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee not to exceed the actual cost of reproducing the record.   In determining the actual cost of reproducing a record, the custodian of the record may include only:    (i) the actual cost of any storage devices or materials provided to the requester in complying with such request;   (ii) an amount equal to the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare a copy of the requested record, provided that no fee shall be charged unless at least two hours of employee time is needed to prepare a copy of the record requested, and   (iii) when the custodian`s information technology capabilities are inadequate to prepare a copy of the record, the custodian may charge the requestor the actual cost of engaging an outside service to prepare a copy, provided that no fee shall be charged in excess of the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid state employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare such a copy.   In no case shall fees for black and white photocopies or computer printouts exceed 5 cents per letter size page or smaller or 7 cents per legal size page.   A page shall be defined as one side of a sheet of paper.  Each person having custody of a record shall inform the requester of the estimated cost of preparing a copy of the record if more than two hours of an employee`s time is needed, or if an outside professional service would be retained to prepare a copy of the record.   No fee shall be charged to locate, review or segregate requested records except in exceptional circumstances as defined in subsection (j) of this section.    Records shall be furnished without any charge or at a reduced charge if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.   (b) A custodian of a public record shall, within fifteen days following receipt of a request for inspection or copy of a public record, comply with such request except in exceptional circumstances as defined in subsection (j) of this section.   Such request may be delivered in hand to the office of the custodian, mailed via first class mail, or sent by email.   If the custodian refuses or fails to comply with such a request, the person making the request may petition the supervisor of records to compel the custodian to respond or for a determination whether the record requested is public.   Upon the determination by the supervisor of records that the record is public, he shall order the custodian of the public record to comply with the person’s request.   If the custodian refuses or fails to comply with any such order, the supervisor of records shall notify the attorney general or the appropriate district attorney thereof who shall take whatever measures necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of this section, including enforcement of the penalties prescribed under section 15.   The administrative remedy provided by this section shall in no way limit the availability of the administrative remedies provided by the commissioner of administration and finance with respect to any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department or board; nor shall the administrative remedy provided by this section in any way limit the availability of judicial remedies otherwise available to any person requesting a public record.   If a custodian of a public record refuses or fails to comply with the request of any person for inspection or copy of a public record or with an administrative order under this section, the supreme judicial or superior court shall have jurisdiction to order compliance.   Proceedings arising under this section shall take precedence on the docket over other civil cases and shall be expedited.   In any such proceeding, the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party seeking public records if that party has substantially prevailed.   A judgment or settlement in plaintiff’s favor shall not be a prerequisite to obtaining an award of attorney’s fees or costs.”   SECTION 5.   Section 10 of Chapter 66 of the General Laws is hereby further amended in paragraph three in subsection(d) by inserting after the word “number”, the words  “…personal email address…”.   SECTION 6.   Section 10 of chapter 66 is hereby further amended by inserting at the end thereof the following paragraphs:-  “(e) If a public record or public record information is available in electronic form, the custodian shall, at the option of the requester, provide it in that form.   In making a record available to a requestor, the custodian shall provide the record in any format requested if the record is readily reproducible in that format.   If a request does not specify the format for producing electronically stored information, the custodian shall provide the record information in a common format that is reasonably usable.   For public records in electronic form, a custodian may charge the requestor only the actual cost of any storage devices or materials provided to the requestor.   Any programming necessary to retrieve a public record or public record information and provide the record or record information in the requested format, or to allow the record or record information to be read or printed, shall not be deemed to be the preparation or creation of a new record.   (f) Every state agency, as defined by Chapter 66A, that has the ability to provide public internet access, at no charge, to a public record in its custody, shall make reasonable efforts to do so.   A custodian state agency shall be required to provide public internet access, at no charge, to the following types of public records in searchable format:   (i) final opinions, decisions, orders, or votes from agency proceedings;   (ii) annual reports;   (iii) reports to the General Court;   (iv) notices of regulations proposed under chapter 30A;   (v) notices of hearings;   (vi) winning bids for public contracts;   (vii) applications and awards of federal, state, and municipal government grants;   (viii) minutes of open meetings;   (ix) agency budgets; and   (x) any public record information of significant interest to the general public including, but not limited to, public record information which has been the subject of multiple public records requests or which could reasonably be anticipated to be the subject of multiple public records requests in the future.    (g) The secretary of each executive office shall, on or before October 1, 2016, promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this act which shall be applicable to all agencies, departments, boards, commissions, authorities, and instrumentalities within each of said executive offices subject to the approval of the secretary of administration and finance, in consultation with the chief information officer of the commonwealth.   Any agency not within any such executive office shall be subject to the regulations of the secretary of administration and finance.   The attorney general, the state secretary, the state treasurer and the state auditor shall adopt applicable regulations for their respective departments on or before October 1, 2016.    (h)  in exceptional circumstances, a custodian of public records may, after making a good faith attempt to work with the requestor to modify the scope of the request or the timeframe for compliance, petition the supervisor of records for one or both of the following:    (1) additional time to comply with a request under subsection (b) of this section, not to exceed 30 days from the receipt of the request from the custodian;   (2)  authorization to charge a special service fee as a condition to complying with a request under subsection (b) of this section, not to exceed the actual time spent locating, reviewing and segregating the requested records, assessed at the current state minimum wage.    (i) A custodian of public records may submit a petition under subsection (h) any time within fifteen days following receipt of a request.    The custodian shall deliver written copies of the petition to the supervisor and the requestor.    The petition shall specify the reasons that the request is being treated as exceptional, the amount of any additional time requested and an itemized estimate of any service fee requested.    The supervisor may grant or deny any such petition in whole or in part.    (j) For the purposes of this section, “exceptional circumstances” shall mean one or both of the following:    (1) The custodian has received more than 15 requests from the same person in the previous 30 days, excluding requests in the public interest under subsection (a) of this section;   (2)  The custodian reasonably estimates that the response to the request will exceed 500 pages and that the time required to locate, compile and copy the records will exceed 20 hours.”"
massachusetts,3dk0u1,Manitcor,0,Fri Jul 17 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"SECTION 7.   Said section 15 of chapter 66 is hereby amended by striking the last sentence and replacing it with the following:--   “A court shall impose upon any public entity, when an officer or employee thereof refuses or neglects to perform any duty imposed by this chapter, a civil fine of $20 a day for the first 30 days of such refusal or neglect, and $50 a day for every subsequent day.   If a custodian of a public record refuses or fails to comply with a request or order from the supervisor of records made under section 10 of this chapter, the fine shall be assessed starting fifteen days after the custodian received the request or order.   For other statutory violations, the fine shall be assessed starting after the public officer has had a reasonable opportunity to perform his duties.   A court may reduce or waive this fine if it finds that the public officer has made a good faith attempt to comply with the duties imposed by this chapter.   In determining whether to reduce or waive a fine, the court shall consider   (1) the duration and nature of the violation;   (2) any past violations by the same public entity; and (3) the degree to which the violation impedes access to public records.”  https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H3665  https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H3665/History  _  W H.2772 final re-draft.docx 19KB"

Obfuscation and hiding from facts just shows you have a bad deal to sell.
massachusetts,3dk0u1,Manitcor,4,Fri Jul 17 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"Please explain what you find wrong or onerous with this measure.   I tire of the typical MA bully pulpit screaming about how ""this is bad and you should support me"" with no real verifiable reason.  While the legalese can be tough to grok this measure boils down to:   A municipality must make their records available upon request Those records must be provided in at minimum a standard text format. This means copy->paste; even if the towns record system is horribly old VT100 terminal clients (one of the more common ways of accessing older system by most towns) allow for direct copy and paste of their content. You can charge for this service but you cannot charge more than it actually cost you to get the information. If for some reason the designated record keeper cannot retrieve this info an outside contractor or agency may be engaged and the cost can be passed to the the requester (I am sure many towns will use this as their loophole though its not that bad with the reasonable weasel words in there) A record keeper must be designated, this in nearly every case but the largest towns (Boston, Lowell, etc) will be the clerk or staff that already runs the records office. Instead of telling me to piss off they will now help me with the information my property taxes already pay to maintain."

massachusetts,3dk0u1,Manitcor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"They don't like a bill that is currently being considered by the MA legislature. They represent some partisan groups in the state and what to color your opinion in a classic ""lawn sign"" politics way that I have seen for years around here. They are making a non-specific claim that his bill will be too onerous and/or expensive for state organizations and municipalities to implement.  The bill basically says that all state municipalities (your town, the police, etc) are required by state law to provide public records on request. They are not allowed to deny your request nor are they allowed to charge you more than it cost them to get the records for you.  Further the bill says that they must provide you with the records in a digital format that can be opened in very simple text editors like Notepad (meaning all computers can read the data without special software or skills).   Finally they are requiring all municipalities and state categorizations to designate an employee of that organization as the person who will handle processing these public requests.  I personally think the OP is selling lies to support their own agenda's (whatever that may be). I don't really see the law as being an issue and it really brings the state in line with what they are supposed to be doing anyway. This state exists because of voting tax payers. The bureaucracy my tax dollars support are not my king or my ruler and have no right to tell me what public information I can or cannot have. Further the state or any of its organizations should not be allowed to create artificial barriers to records my tax dollars pay to maintain."

massachusetts,3di8u6,solariam,3,Thu Jul 16 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute. Yes, women likely provide the most services BUT THERE ARE FAR MORE PEOPLE SOLICITING THESE SERVICES THAN PROVIDING THEM.

massachusetts,3di8u6,Doza13,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"That's a completely separate question, one that we probably agree on (that would be a waste of taxpayer funds).   That doesn't mean that the decision to procure a prostitute or the demand for prostitution is the same as chemical dependency/overcoming drug addiction with no substantive change in the job market/social net.   Edit: Besides, saying that an arrest=jail time is completely incorrect."
massachusetts,3di8u6,solariam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"It's an analogy. Attempting to control crime by arresting the demand side has generally been an abysmal failure.  See examples: drugs, gambling."
massachusetts,3di8u6,Doza13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that it's an analogy. I'm critiquing your analogy because you're comparing things that I believe are more different than similar.  On the second point: You're talking about controlling demand by arresting ""demand""-ers, under ""no-tolerance"" laws with harsh sentencing-- that specific strategy HAS been an abysmal failure.  Controlling demand for illegal appetites through other strategies is often the most effective way to control them. Offering affordable and accessible treatment/healthcare, and access to education/employment that pays a living wage: this decreases demand for (most) controlled substances and decreases supply, in terms of the number of people willing to be involved in their production/sale.  (Also, the War on Drugs abroad/the Mexican border/restrictions on pseudoephedrine are pretty good arguments that trying to control supply (edit: control supply alone) is ineffective.)  Allowing online sports betting would likely decrease demand for illegal gambling.   Educating the public in a compelling way about human trafficking might (if it's an effective campaign) decrease demand for prostitution."
massachusetts,3di8u6,solariam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:57 2015 UTC,through other strategies    Which is the same thing as I said.  Going after the demand side by arresting them (the whole topic of this thread) is not the way to go.  In that sense the analogy is spot on.  I mean that's what we are talking about here no?
massachusetts,3di8u6,Doza13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"LOL. Arresting and jailing people who are chemically dependent and who do not have many options for real economic opportunity outside of the drug trade is ineffective because it doesn't work. (Because those offenders don't really have many other real options)  Jailing johns, who are not chemically dependent on prostitutes, are willfully contributing to a massive exploitative machine, and who have lots of other options for human contact/sexual release, would be a waste (or so we've decided). It is important to note that these are offenders with far more legal options to resolve their ""problem"", who are not typically trapped into a cycle of picking up prostitutes and aren't felons after they're charged.   That doesn't mean that arresting johns is a bad idea (you can arrest them and fine them for contributing to something that is negative for the community, demand training, put them on probation). It means that jailing johns is a bad idea.   Also, the offenses, the motivations, and the number of reasonable alternatives that the ""offender"" has are wildly different between the two. Falsely comparing the two leads to misunderstandings of both issues and their causes.  So, yeah, it's a bad analogy."
massachusetts,3di8u6,solariam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:38 2015 UTC,You took a simple analogy and over analyzed far beyond it's original intent.  Congratulations.   leads to misunderstandings of both issues and their causes.   My initial comment does no such thing.

massachusetts,3d8rcs,adambomb5060,0,Wed Jul 15 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"That's tough. I don't want to stop anyone from doing something as long as no ones getting hurt.   As I said my big issue with stoners is pushing important agendas infront of their true intentions in an attempt to legalize pot for recreation. I have a huge amount of respect for smokers who just say ""I just want to be able to go to the store and buy it."" But not for people who treat it like some big crusade of government trying to step on their rights and actively try and hurt people.   My issue with Recreational use is shady because like it or not, Pot isn't beer. It smells bad I have neighbors the next house over who smoke regularly and it carries bad. So I have concerns for people with kids who might want to keep from exposing but will be unable to because it's pretty potent stuff.   There's also making sure laws are in place so people don't put it in edible products that aren't labeled correctly and all that. I don't care if people enjoy pot but I don't need it pushed on me, I dealt with that shit in high school.   If the balance is worked out and people can partake in a way that people who don't want to won't notice? Absolutely I'm for it. The potency is something stoners tend to underestimate though. I've smelled it in cars passing by and next door and all of that.   It's all about respect and I personally haven't dealt with a lot of stoners who respect that some people just don't like it and don't want to be involved with it."
massachusetts,3d8rcs,Elementium,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"No argument from me, but I will say, if you smell it everywhere now when it's illegal, do you really think it will get that much worse if legalized? Perhaps legalization will even reduce the amount of smoking, since less fragrant alternatives, which are also generally healthier (vaping, oils, edibles), will be way more available.  As for medical, if we just legalized outright, all the difficulties with medical research would be gone, and medical use advocates could move on to supporting those efforts and pushing insurers and care providers to get serious about prescribing and covering it.

massachusetts,3cvwuo,robmasten,6,Sat Jul 11 05:35:08 2015 UTC,"Lowell is a mill town. The first, really. If you're into the history of American textile production and Industrial revolutions and stuff then you came to the right place. You can also visit Jack Kerouac's grave have if you're more of a literary persuasion. Or if your preference runs towards painting then there's the James McNeil Whistler birthplace.  As for food, of you like Southeast Asian food then, buddy, you are in luck! Lowell has one of the largest concentrations of Cambodians in the United States. Let's just say there's more than a few Asian cuisine restaurants around town. If you prefer more standard American fare then you could try Cobblestone's downtown.  It's funny that someone mentioned Concord because, to be completely honest, I just moved to Lowell this week and don't know much more than what I've already mentioned. And I happen to haul from the Concord area which isn't very far away from Lowell by car. The restaurants there are pretty standard as such things go but it is a nice walkable little town. Lexington really isn't much different. But if you're into Revolutionary War history then you should probably check out the North Bridge and the Battle Road stuff.  It might be worth it for you to drive over to Gloucester. Steamed crabs is more of a Maryland thing, isn't it? I don't think I've ever really seen anybody do crabs that way up here. That is, if you are expecting the mallet and the hole in the table and a bucket of crabs and beer and so on and so forth, I think you're barking up the wrong tree. You could probably find a crab cake or two there along with the steamers, quahogs, oysters and lobsters that are the more standard fare. But let me give you tip there and tell you to skip all that and ask for the fried cod cheeks. Go to Charlie's Place in Gloucester and ask them if they have cod cheeks. I'd walk ten miles for some cheeks.  Ooh and Lowell has a trolley museum with a working trolley. There's some art galleries and dive bars too. The weather has been gorgeous lately and I've just been enjoying walking around watching the ducks and herons in the canals down by the Riverwalk. There's a huge folk festival coming up on the 24th too if that floats your boat.  I hope this has been of some assistance. If you need anything else answered just let me know."

massachusetts,3cmgjz,shazammerbammer,0,Thu Jul 9 12:14:58 2015 UTC,"It is this extreme, uninformed reasoning that is exactly the problem with Police & Public relations in our country today.   The majority of people have very little idea of what Policing actually is, and the challenges it takes to police certain demographics, communities, ages, genders, etc. In what has been historically prevalent in recent years, people have turned their back on Policing practices even when Police are reaching out to the community the most in history.   General ignorance, plus feeling confident enough to talk about an issue they know really nothing about, and of course increased crime are what is making the policing profession much harder. And when you make the Police's job harder, it can indirectly or directly negatively affect everybody in the community, no matter who you are.   You don't like Policing Practices, Procedures? Not everyone is going to. But it cannot be stressed more, follow the democratic model to submit a complaint, elect your officials, talk to them instead of ignoring, criticizing, or in extreme circumstances we've seen recently, rioting and fighting back. It's this sort of action that is frustrating in its idea to subvert the powers of democracy by ignoring and shutting out the government instead of working with it to make a better place. People forget government and people work together, the Police isn't something that'll just get up and leave, it's here to stay.    Additionally, general understanding and perspective of the Police is something to take into consideration. You may not like that you were searched by SWAT Armed guys last summer while biking. While in your eyes it make be a harmless, innocent activity, perspective and understanding of the procedures and practices is key. You don't see what they see every day, they deal with entirely different people you'd never want to associate with, almost on an hourly basis so you don't see them, and instead see a nice clean city. And of course perspective, you don't know why they're there, and quite honestly, no harm is done by just complying with them.  This rather silly, liberal minded view on what the Police is, to exist to dress up and play with tanks and look cool, is really something that is harming our country. Not only is it wrong, but it highlights the need for better transparency from Police & the Citizens, with BOTH sides needing to cooperate in a professional, democratic way."

massachusetts,3cmgjz,bootes64,-2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly glad we have them than not. Violent crime against police is up in recent years, and violent crime in general. To have these special units there to protect everyone involved, it's a win-win.   Is it excessive force? Maybe if you see if from the eyes of a suicidal person or a ""suspected"" dealer sleeping at 3AM with his wife and kids, but nobody ever sees it from the perspective of everything that leads to these events, including the Police Officers, information available, criminal history, reporter's story, detective work, and tactical unit's decisions. These situations are so diverse, dynamic, and multi-perspective often beyond the comprehension of the ordinary citizen.   This sort of work most certainly saves lives, and the Police aren't always like this, and it's not a breech of your civil liberties.   I really hate these one sided, Anti-Police articles. They're often just misinformed, taking evidence and presenting the one side to it. There's a lot these departments and councils do to keep their communities and the people in them safe. And when mistakes happen, which of course they do, they learn and adjust. Just because it's not visible to the trained eye, doesn't mean all this behind the scene work doesn't happen (speaking from experience).   It's a terrible vision we have in society today, where everyone, especially around here, always criticizes the Police as a scapegoat to Society's real problems, but never complains when the Police are there to help and protect them like the Boston Bombings. It it those sort of extreme crime instances, that while you may not think exist normally, do exist all throughout the Commonwealth, more often than one may think, and requires the special attention, training, and tactics that they receive. As unfortunate as the event was, the response in Boston Post-Bombing was a example that caught Nationwide attention due to the public bombing, and the manhunt that ensued. Events similar to it happen accross the country often, but often not to the covered extent the Boston events were."

You can read about more about the history of SWAT Teams, and why Los Angeles formed the first team (Due to increased crime). Just because you don't see crime daily where you live, doesn't mean the police deal with less crime. Perspective is key.  And fear mongering? I think it's hard for me to accuse that when I'm disagreeing with an article that's fear mongering over ""Police state"", loss of liberties, ect.

I'd never doubt your expertise in any of the other matters you brought up, but that one sentence was where your opinion was incorrect, factually.   Perhaps the making of threats is normalized in your life, leading to this bias where making a threat is not actually sufficient to be considered one?

massachusetts,3bif3w,CthulhuBread,5,Mon Jun 29 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"Is it weird that these articles largely just focus on how it's unlikely it is we'll make money? Like, I find the way the issue is framed to be so weird.  If someone asked me ""Would you be willing to pay higher taxes and suffer a few weeks of bad traffic to have the Olympics take place in Boston?"" I'd say ""fuck yes I would!"" Instead it seems like all we ever talk about is if it'll play out as a net economic benefit or not.   Studies always talk about how people are happier when they spend money on events and creating memories than if they spend money of physical things. This seems like a rare situation where we can get two for the price of one (the Olympics + infrastructure.) Depending on how the economics work out, we might even get PAID to have both. That just seems like potential icing on the cake for me.  I dunno though. There seems to be so many wildly different estimations on the economic possibilities that it's hard to say."
massachusetts,3bif3w,Diegos_kitchen,6,Mon Jun 29 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"Its not really about ""making money"", it's about how the city will spend the money it already has. In economics there's a thing called ""opportunity cost"", it basically means that in order to obtain one thing you give up the chance to have another thing; like if you only have 400$ you could buy an PS3, but you cant buy an Xbox too (not getting the Xbox or being able to play it's exclusives is the ""opportunity cost"").  The Olympics are an expensive event to host, and that means that the city may have to cut spending on other important things like education or civil services in order to afford the hosting costs. But most reports I've seen say that the Olympics have little long term economic benefits to the cities that host them. A lot of cities end up loosing money in the long run. While the prospect of hosting the games seems good now, it could hurt the city in the long term.  So most of us see forgoing hosting the summer Olympics as a good thing, because the Opportunity cost is too great. That money could be better spent else where, like improving public transport (the Boston subway really sucks). But I'm also not an economist, so I may just be talking out of my ass; so there's that."

It'll be the usual situation of privatizing profit and socializing loss, at the expense of the people of Massachusetts.  Also, the article says the Boston 2024 proposal does not allocate any private funding towards upgrading the T. They're hoping the Olympics will be a catalyst for such upgrades.

massachusetts,3bfp4n,taocn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, EPL, MLS, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit, my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown for states/cities/regional subreddits, or my Swears/Word Breakdown for sports subreddits. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".    American State and Territory Subreddits    Alabama Idaho Mississippi Oklahoma West Virginia   Alaska Illinois Missouri Oregon Wisconsin   Arkansas Indiana Montana Pennsylvania Wyoming   Arizona Iowa Nebraska Rhode Island    California Kansas New Hampshire South Carolina    Colorado Kentucky New Jersey South Dakota    Connecticut Louisiana New Mexico Tennessee    Delaware Maine New York Texas    Florida Massachusetts Nevada Utah    Georgia Maryland North Carolina Vermont    Guam Michigan North Dakota Virginia    Hawaii Minnesota Ohio Washington"

massachusetts,3b8chg,M80IW,0,Sat Jun 27 00:12:30 2015 UTC,Good luck lol. Always fight it if you have a clean record. But focus on you and not the officer. More then likely the magistrate hears people blame others for their mistakes/faults instead of taking responsibility for it.  Being apologetic and learning something from this might go in your favor.
massachusetts,3az2do,KazamaSmokers,13,Wed Jun 24 17:28:06 2015 UTC,That sucks.  I liked Hannaford.
massachusetts,3az2do,i_have_severe,5,Wed Jun 24 22:22:55 2015 UTC,Me too.  My Hannaford actually listened to requests and got them in.  The Stop & Shop near me sells rotting produce. :(

I haven't gone to one since.  Also that location didn't even have much for fresh produce, just a couple apples and oranges that looked like they were made of foam."

massachusetts,3az2do,ezcheez,2,Thu Jun 25 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"Parents. You left out the word ""parents"" from the headline. The grocery chains' corporate owners will / plan to merge, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll merge the chains themselves. For example, Krogers owns and operates several other grocery chains, such as City Market and King Soopers (since 1983)."
