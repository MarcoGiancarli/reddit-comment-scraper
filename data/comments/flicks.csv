flicks,3e3k4v,BogusSoup,5,Tue Jul 21 18:08:31 2015 UTC,Tied with Seven as my favorite David Fincher movies. Seven is a great thriller in a kind of-actiony or horror kind of way but Zodiac is all about the characters and tension. Fincher's clean directing style suits the investigative/journalistic nature of the story. It's not as pulpy as some of Fincher's other films (with the exception of The Social Network) and I think it's better for it.
flicks,3e3k4v,Dani_Californication,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I think the fact that it was based on a true story that also overlapped with the type of material usually covered in his work brought out a unique aspect of his craft that enhanced what he does best. Agree with you about it not being as ""pulpy"" (even though I do usually love stuff that falls under that category) but I'm glad he decided to move in a different direction starting with this movie..."
flicks,3e3k4v,BogusSoup,4,Wed Jul 22 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"Nice. I think The Social Network is Fincher's best, but Zodiac isn't far behind.   What I love so much about Zodiac is how atmospheric it is. The whole movie is immersive and plausible in every way, from visual aesthetic, costumes, hair and makeup, and character writing.   I find each character so unique and fleshed out. No two are the same or even similar. These characters who all work or operate around the same scenario have such different responses to it, usually analogous for their career. Gyllenhaal is a cartoonist with an adventurous and obliviously innocent response to the threat. Downey Jr, as a news writer, accepts the situation in a bare facts way and looks at the entertainment and gossip aspect of it - he even constantly makes fun of the killer. Ruffalo is a cop and he has a much more direct 'figure it out properly and safely' response. He goes off facts and leads, not coincidence and puzzle codes. He doesn't put himself into adventurous danger like Gyllenhaal (basement scene), and he doesn't provoke the Zodiac (RDJ questioning the killer's sexuality)."
flicks,3e3k4v,TheKodachromeMethod,2,Wed Jul 22 04:44:55 2015 UTC,Damn. That is some incredible insight on the characters that I wish I had come up with! Also totally agree about how atmospheric it is. That Lake Scene and opening 4th of July murder--just incredible use of atmosphere that sends chills down my spine.
flicks,3e3k4v,bellsofwar3,2,Wed Jul 22 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said. It's one thing to have characters based off real people, but it's impressive to actually realize the diverse personalities and approaches of all the different responders to the Zodiac killer. The hysteria generated by the murders is the perfect setting for Fincher to explore the recurring themes in many of his movies: desire, obsession, and self-destruction."
flicks,3e3k4v,mathewl832,3,Wed Jul 22 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"I liked Zodiac better the second time I watched it, that's for sure. I think I expected a crime thriller and wasn't prepared for all of the waiting, which is exactly what that case was all about. It is certainly a stylish and well made movie to boot, but better then Fight Club? Can't agree with you there OP..."
flicks,3e3k4v,bellsofwar3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"I love Fight Club as well, so I guess it comes down to personal taste more than anything, but there's something about Zodiac that resonates for me in a much deeper way than any of his other movies. Fight Club is a great concept, and has one of my favorite ending shots of all time, but Zodiac's slow burn and the fact that it was based on a true story brought out a different side to Fincher that I really enjoy and played to the best aspects of his craftsmanship, as I tried to articulate above...no line in Fincher's career filmography may ever top ""YOU'RE TOO FUCKIN' BLONDE"" though..."
flicks,3e3k4v,snackadj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:18:55 2015 UTC,i think zodiac was fincher's last great film tbh.  benjamin button was good but starting with social network i think his stories have just been boring.  i know i'm in the minority with that.

flicks,3e5sve,AyThroughZee,2,Wed Jul 22 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"There was a documentary recently about it, but Richard Stanley, an independent horror/sci-fi director was supposed to do that awful Island of Dr. Moreau film. Apparently after a few days of shooting, the studio canned him and replaced him with Frankenheimer and the script was vastly re-written.    Memoirs of an Invisible Man pretty much sticks out like a sore thumb in John Carpenter's filmography and apparently, it was supposed to be directed by Ivan Reitman."
flicks,3e5sve,FletchDoesNotLive,2,Wed Jul 22 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished watching Spartacus, which changed screenwriter and director after production started. Initially, the screenplay was being written by the guy who wrote the novel that the movie was being adapted from, but apparently he had some trouble with the medium. Then Kirk Douglas had a clash with the assigned director about the movie's tone and scope, and so the studio sent Stanley Kubrick to take over.  Something interesting I didn't realize until I was reading about the production of this movie is that several of the people involved (including the guy who wrote the novel and his replacement screenwriter) had been blacklisted, and it was Douglas' insistence that they be properly credited (along with JFK publicly crossing pocket lines to see the movie) that helped end the Hollywood blacklists."

The hero's journey doesn't by necessity hinge upon a ""prophecy"" or the hero being chosen by some higher power. The prophecy plot device is usually a very easy (and i would argue lazy) way for a writer to ascribe meaning to the character's actions, which is probably why it is most often used in films that target younger viewers.  Personally, I'd say the presence of a prophecy is definitely a good indicator that I won't enjoy a film.

flicks,3e06bc,TomJBeasley,3,Tue Jul 21 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"The thing that always gets me about the chosen one trope is that there is no character development to it. Learning any skill is learning how to fail at it, and learn from it, and do it again. There is a humility built in to it that ""The Chosen One"" doesn't get. They get to be all ego, and bluster then the world cleans up after them.  Even more poorly written (and boring), is the chosen one who is the paragon of morality and somehow knows how to temper their new found power the moment it's handed to them."
flicks,3e06bc,shantivirus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think maybe a lot of the fatigue with this kind of story has come about as a result of the YA boom. A huge number of those stories have a protagonist who is in some way ""special"" and is the ""only one"" who can resolve the conflict of the story. With so many of those films, I can see how it's become tired.  I don't mind that story as long as the character is an interesting one. There has to be something about the chosen one that makes them worth being chosen, if that makes sense.  The Lego Movie subverted the arc so much that I think we might see people being more creative with it in future."

flicks,3e06bc,clwestbr,2,Tue Jul 21 09:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not tired of it exactly but I have outgrown it a bit, I think. Chosen One stories, at least the straightforward formula of it, are very 'rite of passage' / 'coming-of-age' centric and I think mostly pitch themselves to teenagers and young adults. Once you start to have a better sense of the world and your identity as a person, it becomes less interesting on the surface to attach yourself to the whim and fantasy of a naive and inexperienced youth who has some talent but needs to prove themselves against challenges and whatever.   It's still a good template though and it certainly makes sense and is defensible and all, but for me I find myself gravitating more towards stories that involve ensembles and their interrelations or stories that seek to subvert or deconstruct the Chosen One concept a bit and examine why it is a thing in the first place. Of course, then there aren't a ton of examples of either really because so much filmmaking is geared so heavily to rigidly set demographics of which there is something of a gully between teenager and adult. In the mainstream at least."

Well, that has also been done to death since Greek mythology.    ""Luke, I'm yar daddy, and ye kick ass because of mah blood, ye ungrateful cunt.""    Someone with a normal background but got mutated? The comic/Manga have beaten that horse to death and beyond.    ""I got bitten by a radioactive snail and now I'm the slowest superhero on Earth!""    Someone who doesn't know he was special because everyone around him are elites but turns out his powers are useful in some ways that the elites' aren't? This twist has been used many times recently, again, quite often in comic/Manga.    ""Even though I constantly fail my classes in the magic academy, my ability to deactivate magic is super useful in actual combat, what what?""    One reason I think the ""average Joe"" is popular is due to several ""interesting"" factors: 1. There will be training montages. Everyone loves that shit.    2. It's not ""cheating"" with special powers. It's ""perseverance"" and ""practice,"" two things that are popular as Motivational QuotesTM .  3.

I also thought it was a weird choice to film in New Zealand, because the bright landscapes don't fit my idea of a western. This feels even more jarring because of the weird aspect ratio.

I don't know what the underlying message was and I don't really care. I just enjoyed watching some girls run around and cause a ruckus.   7/13 The Long Goodbye (1973) - Robert Altman - Oh my god it WAS Arnold Schwarzenegger. Who knew a 15 minute intro of a man trying to feed his cat and then failing could be so engaging. This movie was felt so strange because it was a thriller, yet very subdued. Also, what happened to his cat?   7/14 Possesed (1947) - Curtis Bernhardt - What a nutter. You think you get to the pique of Joan Crawford's insanity, and then she goes another level higher.   7/15 Dead of Night (1945) - Various - After I got done with this movie I completely forgot about it. I had to find it on a list just to remember the title. All I remember is the golfing segment and how I didn't find it funny because it was so out of place.   7/16 Evil Dead 2 (1987) - Sam Raimi - Apparently a lot of this was just 'recap' but it felt more like a remake. I'm fine with that, I just wasn't prepared for it. I was always told this was the funny one. I was more expecting a comedic tone but this one was just more absurd and fantastic. There was so much blood. It was wonderful. Or should I say. . .groovy!  Spider-Man (2002) - Sam Raimi - This was a rewatch so I'm not logging it, but I'm on a Raimi kick so why not talk about it? I haven't watched this in 10+ years and I never realized how much of it stuck. It was like every detail was in the back of my mind and just needed to be shaken loose. I guess this is my quintessential super hero movie because it's a super hero movie that is fun. Remember when super heroes were fun? Also, I wouldn't recommend watching this before going to bed because the excitement from watching this movie will keep you up.  7/17 Nightmare Alley (1947) - Edmound Goulding - When it started sinking in what a horrible person Tyrone Power's character was, it got really good. Then the ending happened! You didn't even get to see him perform as a carnival geek which disappointed me.   7/18 Darkman (1990) - Sam Raimi - As a movie it's okay. As a Sam Raimi movie it's amazing. The (practical) effects are top notch. The Raimi moments are fun and I had a blast watching it."

The first film ends with the evil force attacking Ash; in the second, the first ten minutes or so show a version of the events of the first film with Ash being accompanied by one person instead of his whole group, and then he gets attacked and thrown across the forest. Everything after that is unique to the second film.  Personally, I often like to watch them back to back, watching the first film, then skipping the first ten minutes of the second and just treating it as a direct continuation of the first."

flicks,3dso1g,HugoStiglit,15,Sun Jul 19 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World (2015) dir. Colin Trevorrow - Great satirical concept muddled by a horrendous screenplay and paint-by-numbers direction from Trevorrow. Chris Pratt gives a typically charismatic and likable performance, and other castmembers such as Bryce Dallas Howard, Jake Johnson, and Vincent D'Onofrio (who looked like he was acting in a much, much cooler and crazier movie) all do good jobs, but the characters themselves are one-note caricatures and the dialogue is cliche'd at best & nauseating at worst. Between this and the equally forgettable Safety Not Guaranteed, really not jazzed about the news of Trevorrow directing Star Wars Episode 9. The sad thing is, this is totally the best of the JP sequels. Did not like it  Jurassic Park (1993) dir. Steven Spielberg (re-watch) - Spielberg tends to get dismissed sometimes as being all-spectacle but I don't think that's fair at all; his grasp on character is much, much better than he gets credit for. Jurassic Park, with the exception of the hacking scene and some of the day time visual effects, has aged wonderfully. This has always been my favorite of Spielberg's movies and it does just about everything right that JW does wrong; likable characters who feel very genuine & have distinct personalities, effective moments of tension that give a real sense of danger (the scene where the T-Rex first appears is fantastic), Spielberg's direction has actual presence, and it actually explores its themes beyond the surface. Jurassic Park was one of those blockbusters that gave just as much attention to discussions on scientific ethics & the moral dangers of playing God as it did on spectacle (and my, what spectacle it is). Jurassic World is all spectacle, which is well and good for escapist entertainment, but 20 years down the line it will not age nearly as well as Jurassic Park has. Still love it  The Overnight (2015) dir. Patrick Brice - Well this was the best sex comedy I've seen in a while. It kind of fizzles out near the very end but there are a lot of funny moments all the way through and the chemistry between Jason Schwartzman and Adam Scott is great. Liked it  Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015) dir. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon - I feel like the director of this movie really likes Wes Anderson and Peter Jackson (namely Heavenly Creatures), because its visual style very much feels like a blend of those two. That's not an insult either, this movie has wonderful camera work courtesy of cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon. Touching and melancholy all the way through, sprinkled with some much-needed levity and the weirdest performance of Nick Offerman's career. Also it references Modest Mouse at one point, so instant cred. One of the better films I've seen so far this year. Liked it  Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) dir. Wes Anderson (re-watch) - This would basically be my favorite Anderson movie ever if The Life Aquatic didn't exist, I feel like not enough people talk about it. Easily the best George Clooney's been in the past few years, as well as very funny vocal performances from all the Anderson regulars. I'd love to see him dabble in animation again, I always thought he'd make an amazing stop-motion adaptation of A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Still love it  Sleeping Beauty (2011) dir. Julia Lee - Almost entirely devoid of conflict, this is an aggressively uninteresting film about an uninteresting protagonist played by an uninterested actress shot in an uninteresting manner. In every frame it seems like everyone from the writer to the director to the actors have little to no actual interest in the story they're telling. If we're being honest, I'm not entirely sure why this exists. Hated it  Eyes Without A Face (1960) dir. Georges Franju - Equal parts violent and poetic, this is the first French horror film I've ever seen (and my introduction to French cinema in general). Its sparse use of dialogue is extremely effective, one of the best moments being the scene where the surgeon's daughter is alone tending to the dogs; it establishes her as deeply empathetic and gentle without any dialogue whatsoever. That 5 minute face operation scene is amazing too. My only real gripe is that one of the musical cues sounds more like big-top circus music rather than part of the score for a horror film, but the rest of the score makes up for it. Loved it  Suspiria (1977) dir. Dario Argento (re-watch) - I'm a massive horror fan and this has been one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time since I was in high school and I accidentally caught it during a horror movie marathon on Halloween. Argento's never been good at directing actors and it shows with most of the performances (with the exceptions of lead actress Jessica Harper and a brief cameo by Udo Kier) but the film more than makes up for it with Argento's visuals, dripping with nightmarish style in every frame, and the soundtrack by Goblin, one of my all time favorite film scores. It's the cinematic version of a Grimm fairytale, and is the perfect example of a film that's a masterpiece almost entirely through atmosphere alone. Argento made plenty of other great horror films throughout the 70s and 80s but none of them ever topped Suspiria. Still love it  The Aviator (2004) dir. Martin Scorsese - Holy shit Adam Scott is in this. He's great too, seems to have just wandered in from the set of an old screwball comedy. This is one of the better Scorsese/DiCaprio collaborations, and while I don't think Leo is nuanced enough to capture the mystery and eccentricity of Howard Hughes (one of the most fascinating and enigmatic men of the 20th Century), it's still easily among his best performances. The plane crash sequence is brutal as hell and one of the film's highlights. Still like it"

I wouldn't say Jurassic Park is my favorite Spielberg movie (though I like it very much) but you're right about him making likable characters. And he really can do it regardless of the script. I remember some shots of Sam Neill that conveyed an earnest kindness that you didn't see in the 3rd installment or his other works (well, when he wasn't playing a villain/crazy person)."

Abrams isn't a great director but Star Wars is pretty much the perfect movie for him, and Rian Johnson is a really interesting and out-of-left field pick for Episode VIII, so to end the trilogy with Trevorrow seems odd to me.

So many wide shots and far shots of people against a horizon - a beach, open desert, a hilly desert, sunsets, etc. It was nearly four hours long so I actually watched it in 3 parts. Was not expecting that length. It sort of made Lawrence's falling short a bit more frustrating. Which, I guess, is a positive of the film. It enhanced my emotional reaction. The music was great too and immersed me into the world. Mad Max Fury Road's lighting scheme seems to be heavily inspired by LoA. The orange desert aesthetic is one likely example, but the night time blues are too similarly unorthodox. It's cool to see the inspiration of such a visually pleasant film (LoA) in modern films."

flicks,3dso1g,ryl00,10,Sun Jul 19 05:39:53 2015 UTC,"M (1931, dir. Fritz Lang). A serial child murderer (Peter Lorre) has a city so gripped by fear that both the police and the underworld are on the hunt for him.  Visually striking. Ambient noise sometimes lacking, but that very lack makes some moments of silence-shattering noise all the more memorable.  With no real main character (except maybe Lorre), it comes across at times as somewhat sterile/clinical to me, though still engaging... food more for the brain than the heart.  At least until the end... Lorre has a good moment as the movie brings up the thorny question of responsibility and mental illness, and vigilantism vs justice.  The Asphalt Jungle (1950, dir. John Huston). A small-time crook (Sterling Hayden) gets drawn into a big-time heist.  Okay crime melodrama.  Somewhat passionless at times, and some characterization work felt awkward to me (characters out-of-the-blue monologuing about their feelings/motivations). Hayden seems a somewhat wooden lead; Louis Calhern is excellent as a weak-willed lawyer who gets mixed up in the mess . But some interesting moments scattered about, and a well-done ending.  Marilyn Monroe has a small part as Calhern’s character’s mistress.  The Secret Bride (1934, dir. William Dieterle). Ruth Vincent (Barbara Stanwyck), daughter of the governor, secretly marries the Attorney General (Warren William).  But before they can make it official by informing her father, scandal erupts when a man the governor pardoned deposits money in the governor's bank account.  Political thriller/mystery that moves lightning fast, but the urgency and velocity of the plot can't mask the dryness of the subject matter (or the sterile lifelessness of most of the characters).  Additionally, the ending is rushed and implausible.  Red-Headed Woman (1932, dir. Jack Conway).  Lil (Jean Harlow) schemes to tempt her boss Bill Legendre (Chester Morris) away from his wife.  Entertaining pre-code comedy/drama, with the comedy mainly in the form of the mischievous, capricious opportunist Lil, who is ready and willing to use her womanly wiles to get what she wants. Though her character is ‘in the wrong’, Harlow’s charisma nevertheless makes it hard to hate her; Lil is like an impersonal tornado, cutting a path of destruction through the other characters. It's an interesting tonal contrast to the more cold-blooded and cynical (but otherwise similarly themed) Baby Face."

Nice attention to costume/set design in recreating the era. 3/5  Backcountry dir. Adam MacDonald, 2014  This was actually very good. Not so much a horror as IMDb would suggest but more a survival film - which is good, because a Jaws esque horror about a bear stalking a couple in the woods would most likely be terrible. The bear doesn't show up until an hour in but the film doesn't feel like a chore prior to this moment. Well built characters, nice building up of tension and atmosphere. Good effort from a first time director. 4/5  If.... dir. Lindsay Anderson  Didn't like this very much. Heavily allegorical, experimental film marking the far end of the 1960s with lots of image juxtaposition, overt symbolism and elaborate dream sequences. All very witty and a good look at British culture from that era, but just not very enjoyable. 2/5  The Graduate dir. Mike Nichols, 1967  Fantastic film. Funny, exciting, energetic, meaningful. Even the unfortunate disregard of Mrs Robinson for the second half of the film is covered by the sheer dynamism of the performances and direction. One of the best things about this film - along with the way it captures the spirit of the times perfectly - is the way it shows those universal fears about coming of age (in more ways than one). Great looking back at the journey Hoffman's character takes from bumbling, aimless youth to adult. 5/5"
flicks,3dso1g,L80ssss,8,Sun Jul 19 11:07:08 2015 UTC,"I watched a bunch of stuff this week but I'll only talk about the ones that I have something to say about.    Slow West  I'll start by saying I absolutely loved this one.  Michael Fassbender was so likeable and charming, the rest of the cast was all really solid as well.  I found the simple plot very well paced and extremely gripping.  I didn't expect as much humour as was in the film but it for the most part worked for me.  Visually I found it pretty good although the color palette in certain scenes was a little over stylized bordering on ugly on very rare occasion.  One of my favorite films of the year so far.  5/5   The Death of ""Superman Lives"": What happened?  I try and be positive about most films I see, even when I don't like a film I do my best to pick out the positive elements, this movie however was a piece of shit.  The most obnoxious thing about this film which made me really dislike it was the filmmaker, his constant need to be in front of the camera and his terrible interviewing skills made a lot of the film difficult to sit through.  The information presented and the story he is trying to tell comes off as only mildly interesting and it's stretched over far too long of a runtime.  The film is also consistently ugly to look at and I found the reenactment of certain scenes to be a puzzling inclusion.  Also those opening credits were fucking horrendous looking.  1.5/5   Spring  I went into this movie only knowing that it was supposed to be a pretty good horror flick.  What I got wasn't that but a terrific film nonetheless.  I'm actually glad I didn't know about the romantic and foreign getaway aspects of it because they were a nice surprise and something I didn't know I would love so much.  The female lead is absolutely fantastic and the male lead is pretty decent as well.  The story seems like it should be trite and cliche on paper but it's told in a way that is very genuine.  Even the ending which you really see coming for the entire final act didn't really affect my enjoyment because the way it was handled felt right.  Visually speaking I kind of went back and forth with really liking the way some things were shot and then really disliking the way other scenes were handled.  The creature effects though were, for the most part, pretty good.  4.5/5   Creep  A lot of people have developed a deep dislike for found footage films, mostly because there a lot of poorly done ones.  I think that it's an aesthetic and storytelling technique that can be used to great effect and I feel Creep mostly uses it well.  Looking back on the story, it's not that great or original and Mark Duplass' performance could have used a bit more subtlety to make the payoff more meaningful but the individual scenes and certain ideas in the film are really interesting and original.  The movie also builds tension fairly well at certain moments.  I've been hearing this referred to as a horror comedy which I didn't really get, seemed like a straight up horror/thriller to me.  Overall though I had a lot of fun with this one.  3.75/5"
flicks,3dso1g,EcoleBuissonniere,18,Sun Jul 19 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"Didn't watch too much this week - been too busy with Farscape - but I did manage to squeeze a few films in.  It Follows - Just watched this last night. It was absolutely stunning in every way. Everything just came together for me, from the basic premise (which, come on, is absolutely terrifying), to the obviously great soundtrack, to director David Robert Mitchell's unique visual style. And I think that visual style is what really propels the film into true masterpiece status. It's one thing to be able to take the concept of a shapeshifting creature constantly walking straight towards you and make it scary once it shows up; it's another thing entirely to terrify me during the most innocent, innocuous moments. The slow pans, the intentionally artificial zooms, the incredible shifting of depth of field (used brilliantly in one of my favourite shots, early in the film while Jay is on her date, and the focus shifts to the people outside the restaurant they're in), it was all brilliant. Mitchell also really shows that he understands the importance that score and sound design can have on a film, and his use of those two elements really elevates the film. The editing was incredible as well, the acting was surprisingly great, and I even ended up loving the film's characters. I also adored the ambiguity at some parts of the film. ""Show, don't tell"" is an important concept, and it's used remarkably well. All in all, this film is up there right now with The Social Network, Frances Ha and Leviathan as one of my favourites of the decade.   Summer Interlude - Bergman's most unsung masterpiece. His first serious artistic endeavor was also one of his greatest artistic achievements, surpassing, in my opinion, even films made at the height of his career. The way he draws you into Marie's lost past is just incredible. I really felt happy for her, happy while I was there watching these two kids, and because of that, when Bergman switches to the scenes set in the present, it's even more heart-wrenching than it could have been. He makes a short-lived teenage love story believable, makes the pointlessness of the tragedy in the film only accentuate its sadness rather than leave the viewer feeling unfairly robbed, and manages to end the film with a relatively happy ending without making it feel forced. Absolutely brilliant on every level.   The Magician - Another Bergman film, and this one I didn't love quite as much. Maybe I just didn't entirely grasp what he was going for. Characters seem to do and say things without much purpose or motivation, events just seem to happen without much rhyme or reason, the film seems overall thematically scattered, and, unlike in Summer Interlude, the happy ending does feel forced (the music doesn't help). The film just seems sort of aimless. Random scenes go on for far too long without advancing the film in terms of either plot or theme, certain lines and events feel almost like gibberish, etc. With Bergman's greatest films, even detours in the plot and weird events happening feel relevant, if not to the plot then to the film's overall point. Often in The Magician, though, certain events - such as the actor turning up alive and inside the manor, or the bit with the invisible chains - feel out of place and odd. Even the film's big climax just doesn't feel like it knows what purpose it's meant to serve. It wasn't terrible, mind you - it was well-acted, brilliantly shot (Gunnar Fischer is so underrated), and the mixture of comedy and drama was very well done, as is typical for Bergman - but it felt like a middling effort from a director capable of so much more.   Inside Out - Pixar had me worried. Cars 2 was awful, Brave was beyond disappointing, and Monsters University was the perfect example of an unnecessary sequel (or prequel). Luckily, it looks like, thanks to Pete Docter, they've managed to show yet again why they're such a respected studio. The film is great. The animation is beautiful, the voice performances are well-done, the film's themes are relatable and well-presented, the characters are well fleshed-out, it's funny, it made me cry, it's everything I want from a Pixar film. I feel like I can't really say much that others haven't been constantly saying since it came out, so suffice to say I really enjoyed it.   Scenes from the Suburbs - A short film this time, directed by Spike Jonze as a sort of addition to Arcade Fire's brilliant album The Suburbs. I loved it, as I love basically anything directed by Jonze. I feel like I really need to talk about this one (been meaning to make an /r/TrueFilm post about it, actually). Jonze does a fantastic job of exploring several themes that aren't at all a part of the plot. The biggest one is the idea of looking back at the past, something explored in The Suburbs (particularly with ""Sprawl I (Flatland)"", the song that Jonze chooses to end the short film on). It's mentioned once by the narrator and protagonist, Kyle, in the opening monologue, as an older version of him looks back on the summer in which the short film is set. Beyond that, though, it's all explored not through dialogue or plot or even cinematography, but through editing. In that opening voice-over, Kyle says that, when he thinks back to that summer, he remembers certain things and not others, and wonders why that is. This idea is brilliantly shown through editing, as Jonze skips through things that would ordinarily be considered crucial to the plot. The editing is fragmented, with the audience being shown events as they're halfway done already, and being torn from them before they're over. This is reinforced with fades to black used as a transition. The idea that you only remember certain things is an interesting one, and Jonze makes this point a few times in interesting ways, such as when he cuts to an on-street execution for just a brief moment, which individual shots separated by fades to black, before cutting back to the main plot. It seems like it has no purpose, but it hammers home this idea that he's exploring through editing. Maybe the best example of this comes at the film's climax, in which the character Winter loses his mind and attacks Kyle. It's interesting to compare the version of this scene shown in the short film to the version shown in the music video for ""The Suburbs"" (which was a condensed version of the short film using clips from it). In both versions, Jonze cuts from a party in which Kyle sees his friend Winter - who's dropped out of contact from his friends and cut his hair - to Winter attacking Kyle. In the music video, he gives this a build-up, with Kyle working after hours at his job, his friends running to try to stop what Winter's about to do, Winter arriving, Winter beating on Kyle, their friends stopping the fight, etc. In the short film, however, we just cut straight from the party to a few fragmented shots - separated again with fades to black - of Winter beating Kyle. It's a great way to explore a theme without saying anything, and Jonze does it with several other things in the short film - such as the fear of never being able to ""escape the suburbs"", so to speak (which was also explored in the album, primarily in ""Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)""), which Jonze shows with a recurring shot of an airplane flying through the sky, and a few brief scenes highlighting the border guards around the suburbs in which the characters live (the short film takes place in a weird alternate world in which each suburb is its own mini city-state, complete with its own army). He uses similar ""show, don't tell"" techniques to explore the main idea behind the plot, of Winter being faced with a myriad of adolescent fears and snapping because of it. It's brilliantly done - and this is on top of the short film being brilliantly shot, surprisingly well-acted (all the actors were non-actors at the time, though some have continued acting; notably, the actress who portrayed Zoe was in Boyhood), and making great use of its soundtrack.   Anyways, I sorta got rambling there a bit. TL;DR, I consider Spike Jonze one of the greatest living artists for a good reason."

flicks,3dso1g,GamingTatertot,6,Sun Jul 19 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man: Really charming and enjoyable superhero film mixed it with a little bit of heist. It's witty, Michael Pena is hysterical, Paul Rudd is perfectly cast, Michael Douglas is perfectly cast, and the visuals are outstanding. One of five Marvel Studios films that I actually think is good along with Avengers, GOTF, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man.   Suspicion: An indie mafia thriller that I found to be well shot and I give my praise to the two leads. The director is also very passionate about it and I respect that.   The Dead Zone: This movie was pretty cool. I liked the concept, Walken did good, Sheen did good, and the score was phenomenal. Cronenberg never ceases to astound. I really loved the film and would recommend to anyone!   Monsters: I respect this film. I don't know for sure whether I can say I liked it or enjoyed it because I didn't really care for the characters, the acting, and the story just seemed meh but I respect it because apparently the production was very small and sort of just made do with what they had. I did like the concept and world-building though. Also for a small film, the visuals for the monsters were really good. It's a bit weird to think the director transitioned from this to Godzilla though.  The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951): I really liked this movie. It was a good story, didn't feel generic, and I liked how Klaatu didn't actually reveal what was fully up till the end. It kept the audience waiting. Also the film sort of felt timeless, I'm surprised it was made in 1951.  Scream: My friends hyped this up so much I thought I wouldn't like especially considering I'm not too big with slashers, but I did like it. The opening scene was genuinely terrifying, Dewey was awesome, the mystery was pretty cool, and Rose McGowan.   Saw III: The plot was sort of cool...but at this point in the series it just felt like the same thing as the previous two. Nothing really original. I like how it expanded on the world of Saw and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw is always good but besides that meh.   Saw IV: Didn't really like this one either for all the same reasons as Saw III. The film also had multiple twists. It sort of felt like a parody of the Saw franchise.   Prisoners: Phenomenal movie. Fantastic acting all around from Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Leo, and Dano. The score was good, the cinematography was fantastic. I must admit, I did find the plot predictable because I accurately guessed what would happen about a quarter into the movie. But besides that, amazing movie.  The Road to El Dorado: It was enjoyable. Really nothing else to say about it. I liked the two leads and their friendship.   I wasn't going to mention any of the films I watched in the Obscure/Controversial festival in flicks theater but I have to give a shoutout to Wavelength, which I really liked. It became so absurd and weird that I very much liked and respected it plus I had a great experience watching it with other people. The windows will kill you!"
flicks,3dso1g,TrumanB-12,7,Sun Jul 19 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"For those who read my reviews each week, I'd like to say I stopped using my previous grading schema for movies and use it more as a vague guideline now. As such no more weird decimals.  Memento  (2000) dir. Christopher Nolan  Memento is absolutely perfect for a director like Nolan. It plays to his strengths and alleviates his weaknesses. This mystery thriller is told backwards through the perspective of Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has short term memory loss and tries, with the help of a number of aids such as tattoos, polaroids, and an assortment of notes, to track down his wife's killer. He remembers everything about who he is, where he lives etc, but can't create any memories after the death of his wife. Memento is a clever movie, and it keeps the audience in the dark purposefully, letting them receive information at the same pace as Leonard, and it revels in every single moment we go ""aha"". There's actually two running storylines in the movie. One, in colour, is the reverse story of Leonard from the time he kills someone, and the other, in B&W, is Leonard chronologically telling an unknown caller on the phone the tale of Sammy Jenkins who had the same condition as him but lacked memory aids.  On Leonards backwards journey through time we meet a couple more characters. Each is as enigmatic as the next. We never know till the end whether they are good or bad people, whether they try to help or hurt him. In each segment that we encounter them, Leonard has to restart his relationship with them from scratch and rely on his aids to keep him up to date with previous events. Because of this format, Nolan is allowed to make dialogue have a purely expositions purpose, which as we know from his latest movies, is exactly what he likes to do. Also, Nolan's issues with writing characters is also nonexistent as again, it fits with the style and pace of the film. Any personality to be shown is wisely left up to the excellent performances from the actors. They all ride the fine line between helpful and malicious, slipping only when the script needs them to. I was most impressed by Joe Pantoliano, who plays Leonard's ""friend"" Teddy. Sneaky is the word I'd use to describe his delivery. Memento is one of those films that is so controlled in its making that it only let's a few faults go loose. These are limited to some odd editing in the latter portion of the 2nd act of the movie that slowed it down unnecessarily, and the lack of rewatchability after you see it once, possibly twice. The grand reveal is spectacular in typical Nolan fashion, putting the entire movie in place, but once lined up it doesn't hold too much for analysis, something that the movie would've benefitted from immensely. Also, if Leonard only remembers his wife's death, how does he remember he has memory loss? This didn't bother me until thinking about the movie afterwards, and probably has some answer, but a small tidbit in the film could've covered that base. These are but nitpicks however, and doesn't prevent this from being one of the finest thrillers of the modern era, and in my opinion Nolan's best picture to date. It's riveting and secretive, a damn good watch.   9.5/10  You're Next (2011) dir. Adam Wingard  This is not a very cerebral movie, but it isn't meant to be. A family reunion turns into a bloodbath as 3 masked killers assault their new mansion of a home in the middle of nowhere. This leads to a twist of sorts that you may or may not see coming. It's a gory, silly, fun homage to 80s slashers. It's a horror-comedy with moments of suspense, jumpscares, laughs and blood. It's not outright scary by any means, nor particularly chilling, but you'll have a smile on your face as you witness a plethora of, for the most part, decently (and I mean DECENTLY) acted characters, with surprisingly diverse personalities, be hunted and brutally killed.  Tools for this involve axes, machetes, crossbows, knives, pianowires, spiked floorboards, a blender, and a baseball bat if I recall correctly. The gore effects are very good even if the camera may at times pan away from kills (most likely budget constraints). The house in question is chosen well and it's large nature and exquisite antique furnishing allows for a great location for the movie to play a cat and mouse game. One of the girlfriends of the three brothers in the family rises up to be the star of the show. Erin  (Sharni Vinsion), is tough as nails and a resourceful character you can root for. A badass in the truest form of the word. This is all helped by an homage 80s synth score that still surprisingly stands out among all the other 80s synth scores in use today. My criticisms of the movie are aplenty however. I don't mind it not being very original and I appreciate how tongue in cheek it was, but the suspense dialled down massively once we found out the identity of the killers. The twist itself was fine but the presentation really undermined the antagonists. They go from being dangerous to incapable in a rather short period of time. The masks were a really nice touch and I would've appreciated the dark mood they exuded to be kept more. Also while the chemistry between most of the characters was believable and I enjoyed the bickering, there were multiple instances of botched line delivery. There was also room for more creative kills and quite a few missed opportunities that would've added to the camp factor. Just the action in general would've benefitted from being spaced out more. I really dig the concept and there was a lot of potential here to truly make a modern slasher classic. I always enjoy hide and seek in movies. Nevertheless, I don't regret watching this and it's a good time if you're together with a bunch of friends and are looking for some bloody laughs.  7/10  Signs  (2002) dir. M Night Shyamalan  I have yet to see Unbreakable and The Village, but this might be my favourite of Shyamalans films. Most of the complaints about this movie are unjustified and can be easily rebuffed. I'm not going to spend time going over those points however and will instead redirect you to a superb analysis that covers 90% of my points:  https://youtu.be/V3Ju05PuiyQ  Signs is about aliens visiting earth. And I use that term very deliberately. We don't really know why they are there, but they are. On the other hand it's not really about aliens at all, but the experiences of a family of four (dad Mel Gibson, uncle Joaquin Phoenix, son Rory Culkin, daughter Abigail Breslin) living in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania, as they discover the strange crop circles, and try to sort out their own relationships with each other, their faith, and overcome the death of the mother. Gibson is at the top of his game here and gives it his all. Even though I never really bought into Shyamalan's ideology, fate & god and all, I still sympathised with the estranged character of the father and how he struggles to keep his family together. It's a rather minimalist movie in a lot of ways, but it's focus is why I prefer it over Sixth Sense. There is a lot of attention to detail in terms of both direction, cinematography and production design. Certain scenes are set up in a way so the symbolism behind it becomes apparent. Shyamalan seems to like a lot of static, long shots during conversations, utilising few to not cuts. I agree with this choice especially because the actors are so enthralling to look at and their facial expressions are able to perfectly convey the disquieting feelings they have. Just in general the camerawork is great, lots of shades of yellow and orange that give a sort of brass aesthetic. The poster gives a really good representation of it. It's one of those ""feeling"" movies which is much better experienced than explained. Overall my only faults would be that there was space for the uncle to be fleshed out slightly more. An excellent movie in every sense.  9.5/10  More reviews coming once I type them up"
flicks,3dso1g,TrumanB-12,6,Sun Jul 19 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Coherence (2013) dir.James Ward Byrkit  Coherence is a sci-fi thriller made on a shoestring budget of 50k$ that pretty much takes place exclusively inside one, suburban bungalow. It's 95% of it is comprised by conversations. A bunch of people gather for a dinner party, and after a comet passes overhead, the power goes out in all the houses in their neighbourhood apart from their own, and another duplicate house (also containing duplicates of themselves) down the street. What follows is a series of incredibly dynamic, fast paced dialogue as the people try to decipher what is actually going on and the mechanics behind the occurrences. It's smart and blends a lot of theoretical physics inside of its story in a manner that is not offensive to science. Because the movie is so dialogue driven, I can't say much more about it other than it was my most enjoyable watch this week.  10/10  Gravity (2013) dir.Alfonso Cuaron  For a VFX driven movie light on story, Gravity is surprisingly excellent. After a Russian satellite blows up, debris flies at ultra high speeds towards a crew of three repairing the Hubble Telescope, destroying all in its wake. Sandra Bullock's and George Clooney's characters then begin a journey around Earth's orbit to find themselves a space station that can get them back home. The entire movie looks absolutely stunning. Possibly the best effects I've ever seen. The cinematography is phenomenal too. The camera swerves all over the place, replicating the uncontrollable, floaty state the astronauts are in. The shots of the Earth are particularly magnificent. It's a lot to gawk at. Complementing this is an epic orchestral score that screams BIG. My favourite part of the movie was when the camera goes into Bullock's POV as she scrambles around the exterior of the ISS. Speaking of Bullock, she is probably the weakest part of the movie. Clooney is great. Incredibly charismatic, humorous, and controlled, he owns his role. Bullock is good in her own right, but she can't carry the movie as the protagonist. She doesn't possess much emotional depth or variety to her performance and border on tedious to watch in the later portions of the film. The plot itself could've gone more places and there was space to insert some thought provoking dialogue and themes. I actually though a voice over from Bullock during her lone segments could've worked out. A spectacular show nonetheless, and I'm glad I rewatched it after initially seeing it in 4D when it was released. It conveys the wonder and danger of space like few other movies.   9.0/10  Safety not Guaranteed (2012) dir.Colin Trevorrow  Magazine company employees Darius (Aubrey Plaza), Jeff (Jake Johnson) and Arnau  (Karan Soni) travel to rural England to interview a guy who claims he needs a partner to go with him on a time travel trip. Sounds like it could be a fun ride right? This blurb is incredibly misleading. Yes it does what it says, but that's pretty much it. This is actually just your average romcom with a quirky girl, asshole, nerd, weird guy etc. It's unoriginal and not even in a technically competent way (e.g The Conjuring). Maybe I'm biased towards this genre but I'm far more critical of movies of this type since they dearly have to rely on a good script. I still have a nice time but it's wasted time. Aubrey Plaza is so dull and generic of a protagonist. ""Quirky"" girls piss me off to end in clichéd comedies like these. It's such an obvious pandering to young insecure girls that I see everywhere in movies nowadays. It would be fine if they had depth to them, but they don't. I don't want to talk about this more. The worst part is that it's not even all that awful so I can't be too mad at it.  6.0/10  Easy A (2010) dir. Will Gluck  High school comedies are somewhat of a guilty pleasure of mine at times, and I love Emma Stone so I decided to give this a shot. Quirky (sigh) Olive is ashamed that she spent a weekend doing nothing at home while others went out and had more active lives, so she fabricates a lie to her friend that she slept with some college guy. Unfortunately this is overheard and soon rumour spreads about her ""promiscuity."" She teeters between frustration and taking advantage of this newfound social standing. People start to pay her so she can say they had sex together and this gets pretty big. I don't want to get into too much detail with this movie since its pretty standard fare. It's got quite many laugh out loud moments and Emma Stone hits it out of the park. Her sarcastic, witty persona comes through here, as well as her softer, more insecure self. I adore seeing her on screen and this movie is worth seeing just if you're a fan of hers. The script itself is pretty ridiculous and I couldn't buy it so that help back my enjoyment. It was also very focused on Olive for a lot of the time, having other characters underwritten and out of focus, while not necessarily being efficient enough. It does what it needs to and a bit more.   6.5/10"
flicks,3dso1g,200balloons,6,Sun Jul 19 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"City Hall (1996; d. Harold Becker)  John Cusack stars as fictitious NYC Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun to Al Pacino's Mayor John Pappas.  It's a talky political drama with some thriller elements thrown in, as Calhoun somehow finds time to be a detective while running around the city investigating a triple homicide that involves a decorated city police detective.  I wish this movie had restrained itself to City Hall & the other places of power, rather than trying to blend in a thriller, with elements of city government corruption & mafia influence in the system.  The mystery that Cusack's Calhoun delves into is unremarkable & ultimately very uncomplicated, & that would be fine, if the movie hadn't spent so much time building it up as if it were something profound.  When the movie stays focused on the political realities of running the city, it's at it's most interesting.  The dialogue is fast & sharp, it's really well written, & the lead actors get to show off their verbal dexterity.  Pacino gets to give a big, rousing speech in the middle of the movie, & I loved it.  This movie's strengths are the lead actors & the snappy dialogue.  6 / 10  The Matrix / The Matrix Reloaded / The Matrix Revolutions (1999 / 2003; d. The Wachowskis)  Re-watch: This is a fascinating idea for a movie, & to get it to the screen & have it make much sense is quite an achievement.  It could have been an effective low-budget, under-the-radar sci-fi movie that relied on tons of exposition, but the blockbuster treatment The Matrix got means a lot more showing & less telling.  And that's definitely a lot more fun.    The first movie is it's own island, it works well enough on its own.  The next two ramp things way up, I can't help but respect how all-in the Wachowskis went; even the underground human city of Zion, to which we're introduced as Morpheus rallies the city while explaining that they've got about 24 hours until the machines have dug through to them, & the city's reaction is to dance & shift into full erotic mode, which is a little weird, but I couldn't think of anything else that might be a more effective shorthand for the human spirit & will to survive - Zion's population is generally very young, so you wouldn't necessarily expect a lot of sitting around, chin-stroking & hand-wringing after learning of the threat.  The idea of human choice, & how an artificial intelligence might go about trying to quantify it is brilliant, Neo's conversation with The Architect still makes my head hurt, but I love the anti-climactic feel of that scene, even though it's a very important one to the overall story.  While I'll never be attached to Zion like I got attached to the Rebel bases in the Star Wars series, I admire & somewhat enjoy the machines' attack, & how Zion defends itself.  They pushed the CGI & composite effects to the limit in this & other sequences, & anyone who wants fantastical adventure & action should re-watch these movies before bitching about CGI & romanticizing practical effects, as if the former is over-used & overwhelmingly crappy, while the latter is always the mark of integrity.  Neo's fight with Agent Smith(s) in the park is the one sequence that feels mostly flat for me, a little too mathematically choreographed, & the lighting doesn't help.  Still, it's easy to forget that this level of visual dazzle was still pretty new at the time, & a lot of it worked.  The smart ideas behind The Matrix movies never get buried in the ambitious visuals & sprawling story, & there's humor throughout the 3 movies.  While I've grown a little weary of all the guns & shooting in these movies, the wardrobe & production design still looks fantastic, even if the ""real world"" humans look like German techno DJs whose luggage got mixed up with a grunge band.  Still lots of fun & thought to be had with these movies.  The Matrix - 8 / 10 Reloaded / Revolutions - 7 / 10  The Animatrix (2003; various directors) 9 short films further exploring the universe of The Matrix, using a wide variety of animation.  The Second Renaissance attempts to tell the story of how the machines took over (they, uh, didn't think the humans were giving them enough ""respect"", so they revolted, formed their own country), & like most of the shorts, looks amazing but lacks in interesting story or sound design.  Beyond, about a matrix version of a haunted house, & Matriculated, about a group of surface-dwelling humans (post-apocalypse) who capture & re-program enemy sentinels, are both by far the most interesting.  5 / 10  Nixon (1995; d. Oliver Stone) Re-watch: Stone was on an absolute tear in the late 80s through the 90s, there's not a movie I don't like during the highly productive decade & a half during which he didn't sit still.  Nixon is not one of the first that come to mind when thinking about Stone's run, he'd already caused a fuss with his first biopic (The Doors), released a hyper-violent (for the time) searing indictment of American media & popular culture with Natural Born Killers, & caused an uproar of political conspiracy with JFK, so Nixon could not top or even equal all the fuss Stone had gotten for years at that point.  Which is mostly fine, Nixon is a long, intricately crafted movie that is not out to cause a ruckus, it's a re-examination of a vilified ex-president that still has mystery & intrigue, but nothing like JFK.  Nixon (which starts with a disclaimer that the movie doesn't purport to be completely accurate) is sympathetic to its subject without giving him a makeover, or sugar-coating anything.  Nixon's paranoia, & the distractions it created, are thoroughly represented, as is the head-spinning task of simply managing the dozens of people around him.  Stone looks at Nixon's achievements in foreign diplomacy, while the Watergate break-in slowly grows, from something that could have been dispelled with some strategic humility, into a cancer that cripples & destroys Nixon & his administration.  The dark hangover of the 70s is visually represented, the hippies are spitting on American soldiers, America is trying to digest that the Vietnam war is lost; Nixon lurks in shadowy corners of the White House at night, tumbler in hand & a perpetual mist of sweat on his upper lip.    Stone uses & refines his intense editing style, & use of varying filming techniques to create a feeling of being off-balance, & conveying the mood through every method at his disposal.  Nixon is not as sensational as anything he'd done up to that point, & it's kind of a relief that he downshifted.  7 / 10  Heaven & Earth (1993; d. Oliver Stone) Re-watch: Stone completes his Vietnam trilogy by adapting the autobiographical book When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, by Le Ly Hayslip, a Vietnamese woman whose rural rice-farming village was taken over by the Vietcong.  Stone cast Hiep Thi Le, an unknown, in the lead (even though Tommy Lee Jones is billed as the lead, for unfortunate marketing reasons), & she's a bundle of energy.  It's only after the first hour, which is spent in Le Ly's village, that just how tiny Hiep Thi Le is becomes apparent; the harrowing circumstances her character is subjected to are made more poignant when her diminutive frame is contrasted against the comparatively huge American soldiers, a visual metaphor for how the American military presence further disrupted a country already in great turmoil.  The movie follows Le Ly from teenage farmer to city peasant, to the false romantic salvation of Tommy Lee Jones' Steve Butler, a combat veteran who is desperately trying to hold on to his sanity.  Le Ly has an ambition that begins to surface as Butler marries her, & eventually brings her home to suburban California, & the movie shifts gears considerably as Le Ly experiences culture shock amidst the huge supermarkets & gaudily luxurious homes of her new country.  I never felt a real understanding of Le Ly's motivations after the move to the U.S., but Butler's mental deterioration is well done, & an unfortunately common story of combat soldiers who are unable to re-adjust to civilian life.  Le Ly eventually pursues her entrepreneurial ideas, & it's where things get muddy.  The story ends with a strong note of closure (including an extended guilt-barrage monologue directed at Le Ly), & I find it a satisfying story as things are brought full circle.    Stone gives the movie a big, sometimes lush look, from vibrant green rural Vietnam, to cluttered, chaotic Saigon, to colorful yet dull suburban California; the acting is not always top-notch (nod to Joan Chen as Le Ly's mother, she's the most engaging), but the production is huge & more than makes up for it.  8 / 10  Any Given Sunday (1999; d. Oliver Stone) Re-watch: the last Olive Stone movie that has the urgency & ballsiness that made him one of the most exciting filmmakers of the 80s / 90s.  The NFL won't let you use their properties to tell your story about the often cynical world of professional football?  The hell with it, make up your own league.  Still have plenty of scenes of game action, with roaring crowds & cluttered sidelines.  Do it all with a late-90s who's-who of electronica artists, including Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, Moby, & even, curiously enough, music from the original electronic score of Run Lola Run.  Al Pacino's weary-yet-fierce persona is at the center, while Jamie Foxx's lightning-quick wit is right behind him, a highly interesting pairing.  Professional football is given a thorough x-ray, from the din of the hype, to the hopelessly conflicted sports doctors, to the owners / VIP boxes & players' families, the sports journalists to the locker room culture.  I think the only things Stone missed was the referees, it's a vast system of moving parts that Stone deftly connects & examines.  There's humor to spare, the cast is sharp, the stakes feel real, & wow is it fun.  8 / 10"
flicks,3dso1g,200balloons,7,Sun Jul 19 17:42:29 2015 UTC,"Your Friends & Neighbors (1998; d. Neil LaBute) Re-watch: Still pretty vicious, a trio of fairly despicable men poke their noses & other body parts into places they shouldn't be while engaging in a farcical idea of friendship.  Aaron Eckhart's Barry is the only one who seems salvageable, but that's debatable.  Ben Stiller's Jerry is slime that has learned how to talk, & Jason Patric's Cary has contempt for everything, including his own best friends - he calls them ""sycophantic"" right to their faces.  The vanity & desperation to be all things alpha are rich, while the satire is equally so (two of the three characters have moments of sexual impotence, while the third is repeatedly denied sex by various hang-ups & flashes of anger), American Psycho is the only movie I've seen that takes things farther than this (LaBute's In the Company of Men notwithstanding), & that movie has other things to do that distract it from staying as focused as Neighbors.  The women in the movie are as interesting, & a little more dynamic.  They have their own world of turmoil & doubt, but aren't as stubborn as the men when dealing with it.  My enjoyment of Catherine Keener only grows as I watch more of her movies, she's got something that's hard to describe, but LaBute uses her fantastically.  The veneer of sophistication is betrayed constantly by the pettiness & selfishness of the characters, represented by the cello version of popular Metallica songs that are sparingly used.  No bells & whistles in this (the camera movement & blocking of the book store scene where Cary confronts Keener's Terri is the only scene I remember being a little complicated), it's very confident in its ability to deliver a dark world of human need through great writing & acting.  9 / 10  The Town (2010; d. Ben Affleck) Re-watch: it's tempting to say this is Good Will Hunting meets Heat, but that lame comparison has probably been made plenty of times & I just haven't seen it.  Affleck does go for what he knows, & he certainly seems to know Boston; like Gone Baby Gone, the movie has all kind of shots & faces that look authentic.  I still can't figure out if I like Ben Affleck as an actor, but I guess since I mostly bought into his character in this is a thumbs-up for him (he does anger really well, & has a great sense of humor; the rest is a little shaky), the guy who made a very public point of cuddling with Jennifer Lopez on the deck of a yacht (Lopez is a good actor too, I wish she'd stayed with movies).  The love story between Affleck's MacRay & Rebecca Hall's toonie Claire is relentless in this movie, the peril their newfound love encounters in the second act is resolved far too quickly & unconvincingly, although the bittersweet conclusion is a little better.  The action is the real star of this movie, screeching around Boston's tight, cluttered streets is dizzying.  MacRay's crew is startlingly skilled & determined, something that made my first watch exciting, & it held up this time around.  The baggage that MacRay carries with him threatens to weigh the movie down, but aside from his sudden, remarkable improvement with his taste in women, it works for the story.  Jon Hamm & the FBI angle do wonders to up the tension & scope of the movie, & while there's no Vincent Hanna here, I enjoy the police angle as much as the criminal one.  7 / 10  The Wrestler (2008; d. Darren Aronofsky) Re-watch: the most remarkable movie about a character I'd never thought I'd give a shit about doing things I wouldn't otherwise care about, starring people I don't take note of.  Aronofsky created one of the most fantastic character study dramas I've seen, with such unlikely tools.  Professional wrestlers are living cartoon characters, ones that I enjoyed briefly as a kid & never looked back; at the risk of being snooty, I look at it as trash entertainment, why anyone over the age of 14 would pay any attention is beyond me (which makes this movie's triumph an amazing feat).  Nonetheless, Aronofsky & Mickey Rourke deliver an amazing hybrid of cartoon character & living human being, one who himself was never able to figure out where the cartoon ends & the human being begins.  The world that he's in is incredibly vivid (it helps that I've spent a little time in that part of New Jersey), a stark, fluorescent-lit world that Rourke's Randy soldiers through when he has to - the final scene makes it even more poignant.  Warmth & humor are never far from Randy, a character I'd jump at the chance to see in other movies; the camera work is intimate, as if it feels compelled to follow this broken lion around out of more than just sympathy.  The themes of consequence, identity, & humility are the strongest, although there's a ton of other things the story touches on.  Marisa Tomei is a bonus, the story thread of Randy falling in love with someone who works in a separate world of adult fantasy is clever & adds to the melancholy that Tomei's Pam has self-discipline about work & life, grounded in her parenthood (which of course, Randy has neglected in favor of perpetual fantasy).  There's nothing I don't like about this movie, it's just phenomenal.  10 / 10"
flicks,3dso1g,KennyKatsu,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:25 2015 UTC,Watched The Wrestler for the first time ever like a month ago. Such a fucking great film. Rourke's performance was so good. Man that last scene was so heartbreaking. Tomei was great as well too (and hot).
flicks,3dso1g,Levo_ad_Absurdum,7,Tue Jul 21 09:29:01 2015 UTC,"It Happened One Night 1934, Dir. Frank Capra. This was so fucking adorable. Clark Gable gives a fantastic performance as a wise-cracking journalist. But Claudette Colbert steals the show with a performance that never stops being endearing as she slides between haughty and silly. Their chemistry was fantastic.  I laughed, I cheered. I also can't get that song out of my head - ""Two people in love...are very seldom hungry."" 7.5/10.  Shadows 1959, Dir. John Cassavetes. I don't know if I liked this. It's certainly historically important, and tackles big issues. I cut my teeth on Beat literature, so I also appreciated the jazzy, freewheeling, improvisational narrative. But, I just never felt particularly engaged with what was happening. I'll try again someday. No rating.   Solaris 1972, Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky. I was really surprised by this. From its reputation, I expected a lot more silence, and emptiness. Slow, meditative pans through empty space and that kind of thing. But, I didn't find it slow at all. It was actually pretty dynamic (which isn't to say that it was lacking in meditative qualities, just that there was a lot happening). Admittedly, I wanted the silence. However, the philosophical discussions/speeches, and imagery were top-notch. The story was also quite a bit more compelling than a lot of ""art"" films. Maybe a little more conventional than I was hoping for, but still very good. 8/10.  Days of Heaven 1978, Dir. Terrence Malick. Not as visually dense and stunning as Tree of Life, but also (thankfully) not as heavy-handed as The Thin Red Line. I love the scenery here, and the turn of the century representation of American spirituality. Wild hearts tending the land. I think this movie finally sold me on Malick. 8.5/10.  Persona 1966, Dir. Ingmar Bergman. I can throw around adjectives about this all day (in my experience, the more you like something, the harder it is to discuss). One of the best movies I've ever seen. Engaging right from the strange opening montage. Great existential horror. Feminist powerhouse. Surreal, mesmerizing,  haunting, confusing, beautiful. 10/10.  The 400 Blows 1959, Dir. François Truffaut. A truly touching movie about a misunderstood boy scrambling to find his place in the world, and driven to delinquency by the indifference/ambivalence of the adults around him (his parents are so all over the place, hot and cold, that it would confuse any child). The scene near the end when he talks to a therapist about how his mom doesn't like him, with a tone that said ""Yeah, this is just the way things go,"" was heartbreaking. 9.5/10.  The Gospel According to St. Matthew 1964, Dir. Pier Paolo Pasolini. This film attracted a lot of controversy as a movie about Jesus directed by a gay, atheist, communist. But, it makes sense, I think. The story of Jesus has resonated with all kinds of people for 2000 years. I found this incredibly well-done. It maintains the episodic and somewhat rushed nature of the Gospels, and adds a great atmosphere to the text (which is adapted faithfully). I do have some qualms with it - mostly the actor portraying Jesus. As presented in the Gospels, Jesus isn't exactly the mellow hippie that pop culture portrays him as, but I still felt that the actor was overly severe. A little more serenity would have gone a long way. This goes especially for the Sermon on the Mount (which was presented beautifully from a visual standpoint) - his delivery was harsh and fast, and didn't really give room for the lines to land. Some of this might just come from my fondness for the speech, though. I still loved it, though. Much better than Sàlo. 8.5/10.  Boyhood 2014, Dir. Richard Linklater. Rewatch. This was by far my favorite movie of last year, though I was hesitant to rewatch it, as I've heard the novelty wears off after the first time. Luckily, I didn't find this to be true at all. I would say I liked it even more. Linklater just nails those little moments that often get passed by in cinematic productions. I can't think of many other movies that get me thinking ""What am I doing? Where am I going? Where have all the years gone? Who am I?"" as well or as much as this one. 10/10.  Inside Llewyn Davis 2013, Dir. Joel and Ethan Coen. Rewatch. As a huge fan of 60's folk, this movie almost perfectly satisfies my niche. You might call it a comfort movie, but it's not particularly comforting. Though its narrative of coming to terms with failure is important. Poor Llewyn can't catch a break - he's an asshole, though it's up to interpretation whether he was always that way, or if failure made him that way. Llewyn does seem to accept his lot by the end, though without the historical context that we have, he isn't aware of just how much the entire folk scene is going to be eclipsed by the young nasal voiced singer that pops up at the end (though he does give him a somewhat knowing look while passing by). Always enjoyable, and probably my favorite movie from the Coens. 9/10."
flicks,3dso1g,white_water,5,Sun Jul 19 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"didn't see enough this week  The Death of “Superman Lives”: What Happened? (2015)  Very poorly made documentary. It's like an amateurish Youtube video. Skip it, just read about it online. You can read the Wikipedia page in 10 minutes and you don't have to sit through almost 2 hours of bad doc filmmaking. 1/5  The Puffy Chair (2005)  Because I watched Creep last week and loved it I wanted to see something with Mark Duplass in it. Based on the first 5 minutes I was pretty much ready to hate the movie, it looks really ugly, the camerawork is awful. After the opening they tone down the close ups and zooms a little and the movie very quickly grew on me. Pretty much proof that only thing you need to make a movie is a camera and a bunch of good actors. 3.5/5  Cannibal Holocaust (1980)  This is considered to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made right? goes to check IMDb and RT Oh well, looks like it isn't. Cannibal Holocaust is already over 30 years old and I feel like it's reputation as this awful piece of exploitation is still affecting on people's thoughts on it. I don't think most horror/movie fans have even seen it based on it's reputation. People hear how disturbing it is and they think it's something they can't handle (when recent movies like Saw etc are much gorier) and just won't watch it.   Sure it is a very tough watch but I was really surprised what a really good movie this actually was. I was expecting some poorly shot exploitation but the movie looks beautiful. It looks incredible on blu ray. Even the found footage parts are beautifully filmed, which still haven't been topped in how authentic they feel like. With all the recent found footage crap we've come to expect found footage look like shit which is why CH feels so jarring. There isn't a scene or a single frame where the ""who is filming/why are they filming"" rule of found footage is broken. The true genius and what makes CH work is the juxtaposition of the score. The movie has a beautiful orchestral score and I believe if the movie had been scored like a horror movie with menacing and creepy music/sound effects, it would be too disturbing and thus maybe unwatchable.   It's a weird thing to say but I consider CH a masterpiece. It's a incredible piece of filmmaking. Something I maybe wouldn't recommend to everybody because it really is very graphic and hard to watch (with the animal deaths) but if it interests you definitely check it out.  4.5/5"
flicks,3dso1g,Stankshadow,3,Sun Jul 19 08:28:57 2015 UTC,My issue with Cannibal Holocaust is I don't get what it's trying to say. The film is the story of a group of people who manipulate natives into violence for entertainment purposes. The film condemns the characters for creating death and violence just for exploitive purposes then the actual movie goes and kills animals for exploitive purposes. Am I not seeing something or is the film amazingly hypocritical? I enjoy the film and love the soundtrack but I'm genuinely confused about its message.
flicks,3dso1g,Raspberry_Bacon_Sex,5,Sun Jul 19 12:50:19 2015 UTC,"The hypocrisy of it is part of the point. It's a commentary on how people are willing to condemn others for terrible things while ignoring their own actions. In this case it's a movie condemning filmmakers for encouraging violence, but the film itself incorporates lots of IRL violence (animals). It could also be a meta-commentary on not just humans but the film industry. Willing to do terrible things and exploit people  while simultaneously condemning those terrible things. Just my quick reaction, I'd have to rewatch it to be sure about any of this gibberish ^"
flicks,3dso1g,HugoStiglit,3,Sun Jul 19 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"Cannibal Holocaust is a great movie, which people tend to dismiss based on its title and status as an exploitation movie (a genre that is highly, highly undervalued). Really ahead of its time too, it did found footage decades before that sub-genre became popular and did it a million times better than the rest of them. Only thing I don't like about it is the fact that they killed real animals, which Ruggero Deodato has said was his biggest regret as a filmmaker.  Check out the X-rated cut of Caligula if you want another under-appreciated and surprisingly well made exploitation movie. I watched it in high school because of the Cinema Snob episode about it and it's been one of my favorites ever since."
flicks,3dso1g,montypython22,5,Sun Jul 19 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"I'll modify what I've written on /r/TrueFilm.  I have reviewed most of these on my Letterboxd, too, so feel free to check those out: http://letterboxd.com/montypython22/  In order of preference:  Shoot The Piano Player (François Truffaut, 1960): ★★★★★  In ""Tirez sur le pianiste"", François Truffaut, true to his piano-playing hero Charlie, plays all the right notes in a devastating, hilarious, cheeky, and ultimately tragic story about a sweet-hearted piano virtuouso, the women in his life, and the crime syndicate that refuses to let him live out his days in peace. I have never been more involved with a noir-esque loner protagonist than Truffaut's Charlie; he is the kind of guy you wish many crime capers had at their center, but never do. Charlie is everything you DON'T expect in a leading male: he's sedate, he's understanding of his partner's problems, he's timid, and he actually respects women.  Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles  (Chantel Akerman, 1975): (no rating)  There comes a movie every once in a while that really sweeps in and knocks you off your ass. It gets you tense, unable to breathe at times out of excitement of what you're seeing. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is that kind of movie. You are watching a woman's life and her closeted universe unfold right before your very eyes. This does not feel like 200 minutes.  El Angel Exterminador (re-watch) (Luis Bunuel, 1962): ★★★★★  My favorite Buñuel. It's a strange trip with no answer; I'm not sure Buñuel himself cared to explain why the aristocrats cannot leave the living-room. It is loads of surrealistic fun, nonetheless, with sheep leading sheep and an ending that, in a brisk 3 minutes, completely decimates religious institutions.  The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1943): ★★★★★  When I’m an old decrepit man, I’ll ask for only two movies to be played ad infinitum at all times: Les Demoiselles de Rochefort and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. It’s a jolly good time with smashing performances. The greatest moment is when Anton “Auteur” Walbrook delivers an emotional monologue on the effect of Nazism and how he feels like an alien to a bunch of British bureaucrats who cannot possibly understand how hard his life has been. Brilliant stuff.  Love Streams (John Cassavetes, 1984): ★★★★1/2  Another home-run for John Cassavetes, who delivers what could be his finest masterpiece yet, in Love Streams. I’m still trying to figure out the purpose for some of the decisions in the final act of Love Streams—notably, the symbolic inclusion of a naked-dog-man in the home of the lead protagonist—but it’s a truly bold, bizarre concoction. The brother and sister of the film (played by husband-and-wife-team Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands) are both deprived of love at every juncture in their increasingly-meaningless lives. But just when they’re able to find love with each other, the other yanks themselves away at the chance of a new life with their old past. It’s a very subdued story, but one which is told with breathtaking originality and contains some of the most memorable scenes in Cassavetes’ oeuvre. Not the least of which is this surrealistic, Fosse-esque ballet between Gena Rowlands, Seymour Cassel (her recently divorced husband), and their daughter who hates Rowlands. Definitely worth checking out.  Who Killed Who? (Tex Avery, 1944): ★★★★1/2  They don’t make cartoons like this one anymore. Tex Avery delivers the goods in a rampant, no-holds-barred parody of detective stories.  Simon del Desierto (re-watch) (Luis Bunuel, 1965): ★★★★1/2  Silvia Pinal can do no wrong. And the ending qualifies as one of the greatest twists in all of moviedom. Fuck Kael for saying it’s not feasible within the film’s vantage point. With Bunuel, anything goes.  Belle de Jour (Luis Bunuel, 1967): ★★★★1/2  Still processing this chesnut. I’ve got only one word: “Hmmmm….”  You see, Bunuel wants you to find meaning in the final scene. Bunuel wants you to question and to make you wonder about the trajectory of the film, how it’s an erotica movie that manages to dance around the actual penetration.   But of course, seeing as it’s Bunuel, I may find myself just running and circles and saying, “Fuck it. Catherine Deneuve is a goddess. Bunuel is a mischievous imp. They’ve had their fun. On with my day!”  Jules et Jim (François Truffaut, 1961): ★★★1/2  After the hi-powered antix of Shoot the Piano Player, I feared anything that FT made afterward would pale in comparison. Jules et Jim proves me partially right.  It's a formidable first half—almost entirely narrated, it recounts the disastrous love triangle between Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a deliriously impulsive woman who switches between would-be suitors Jules (Oskar Werner, who picks up where the Charles Aznavour-played Charlie from Tirez left off) and Jim (Henri Serre) faster than she switches stockings. It all starts off happy, idyllic, and stylistically bold as Truffaut continues his Tirez-techniques: fast-cuts, jumpy camera, kinetic camera glides that get us to understand the non-stop fun between J, J, and C.  But unfortunately, somewhere along the way, FT loses sight of the ferocity of the story, and I lose interest in the film's second half. It's beating a dead horse for 40 minutes--Catherine is a bitch, Jules is a wimp, Jim doesn't know who to side with. And its ending—a one-way ticket to Atlantis courtesy of J & C—is so ridiculous, you can't help but laugh. It all ends rather suddenly, and we feel like we haven't gotten anywhere with our protagonists. Pity, since the first half holds so much promise.  The Three Musketeers (Richard Lester, 1973): ★★★  Well, even masters have a bad day. This is a good attempt at transferring the Dumas book to the screen, but it’s…kind of hollow. It’s devoid of the Lester antix that I enjoy so much. He only settles for these very obvious gags that have very little payoff in the long-run, unlike Tati, whose gags are anti-gags and that’s why they’re funny.   The Cat’s Meow (Peter Bogdanovich, 2001): ★★★  The artsy justification of TMZ.  A lurid Hollywood mel-lore-drama that only gets acclaim because the director heard the story from a more famous director who made his most famous film about the antagonist of the first guy's film. Very few directorial choices work--Dunst's performance isn't that spectacular, hitting the same punchy beats you'd expect an actress of her caliber to hit--, and Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin is just...bizarre--but, hey, we do get Edward Herrmann (known to many as the History Channel guy) doing a puppy-dog sympathetic portrayal of Wiliam Randolph Hearst. So that's new!  Still, though, what a juicy story it is."
flicks,3dso1g,dilyam,6,Sun Jul 19 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"Serpico 1973, Dir. by Sidney Lumet – I really enjoyed this film. Lumet did a great job of painting Serpico as a hero most people can enjoy. Pacino was great, and has inspired me to watch more of his films. I'll also try to watch some more Lumet now. Network is one of my favorite films, and after seeing this I can't wait to see what else he has to offer. 8/10  Big Hero 6 2014, Dir. by Don Hall & Chris Williams – What an incredibly fun film. It definitely had its flaws, but it was still a great ride. It was extremely exposition heavy, to the point where it got really annoying. Some things were predictable, but it had still had me guessing at other times. Some parts were hilarious, like drunk Baymax. I also like how Marvel didn’t want anything to do with the film but they still managed to get a Stan Lee cameo in there. I don’t know if it’s deserving of Best Animated Feature (I really liked HTTYD2), but it’s a movie I wouldn’t mind watching again and showing to my future kids. 6.5-7/10  Heat 1995, Dir. by Michael Mann – The “macho man” will always win. That’s what I seemed to get out of this film. It was entertaining all the way through and seemed a lot shorter than the nearly 3 hour run time. De Niro and Pacino kill it, as usual. The film definitely glorifies male chauvinism, which I don’t think is necessarily a bad thing. It also kind of demonizes most of the women, except the most innocent, virgin type female who does not ever get involved in the organized crime lifestyle. I would consider myself a feminist, but that shouldn’t limit me from enjoying all types of films, nor should it stop me from recognizing incredible filmmaking. Looking back at the film I should have been able to tell who was going to come out on top. In a film that honors the manly man, it only makes sense that the winner would be the honest, hardworking, relentless, family man. It was such a compelling film that I feel most people would enjoy. It’s kind of like GTA but in a movie, and cops aren’t the devil. 8.5/10  7 Days in Hell 2015, Dir. by Jake Szymanski – Downright Hilarious. Andy Samberg and Kit Harrington were awesome. I don’t watch GOT so it wasn’t a surprise to see Kit Harrington like that, because I haven’t seen him at all. All of the jokes were hilarious and they got such a great a comedic cast. I also like how now comedies can show grotesque male nudity as well as female. 8/10  Lava 2015, Dir. by James Ford Murphy – Cute, sweet, emotional. I enjoyed it. It definitely made me feel something and it looked amazing.  Inside Out 2015, Dir. by Pete Doctor – It certainly provoked a lot of emotion in me. If I were watching this by myself I would probably cry like a baby. A fun movie for kids, but even more interesting for adults. I think it would be great to show maybe a 12-14 year old. The voice acting was great and the visuals were incredible. A very artful film. 8/10  Dial M for Murder 1954, Dir. by Alfred Hitchcock – When I first started watching Hitchcock’s films I thought I would enjoy them, not too much, but be able to understand why they are so important. After watching a few, I have been able to realize why they are so important and influential, and I actually find them incredibly entertaining. You never know where the story is going and the suspense is always magnificent. This film was no exception. This film had it all, great acting, a compelling story and impeccable direction. I just want to keep watching more and more of his films. 9/10"

Would highly recommend checking it out!"
flicks,3dso1g,200balloons,2,Sun Jul 19 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"As far as Heat, I never saw it as ""demonizing"" women, & haven't heard that opinion.  Justine (Diane Venora), is at her wit's end with Pacino's Hanna; she's intelligent & sophisticated, ideal really.  Maybe because she cheats on Hanna, that could be interpreted as her being a bad person, but I never thought of it that way.  It's made clear that Hanna's first priority, 24/7, is his work.  To me, that's even colder than seeking a fling on the side.  Justine is caught with Ralph, who's presented as something of a mope.  Ralph is probably not the same caliber as Justine, but I took it as just how desperate Justine had become for reliable human contact & intimacy.    I don't think that demonizes Justine, Hanna has had multiple failed marriages & his marriage to Justine is going the same route.  It's his fault, Justine is using poor judgment as a result of Hanna's emotional unavailability.  Her prescription drug use isn't cutting it anymore as a buffer between her & the failing marriage.  If it weren't for Justine openly confronting Hanna about his selfish behavior, it would probably reflect more poorly on Justine; but I find myself sympathetic to her plight, & Venora's performance is razor-sharp.  Justine's daughter, Lauren (I'm guessing that's who your referring to as the ""innocent""), is further collateral damage in Hanna's personal life.  Her biological father is a deadbeat dad, & Hanna is not there to offset that; Justine is too distracted by her unfulfilled needs to be there for Lauren either, something that she is certainly guilty of, & which supports your take.  Ashley Judd's Charlene is a fierce mom who is learning how young & stupid she was to hook up with Kilmer's Chris; his loyalty is split between Charlene & McCauley, & he's got a gambling addiction which further complicates things & ultimately makes Chris responsible for his relationship problems, not Charlene.  The relationship between McCauley & Amy Brenneman's Eady is a little off, but I see Eady being the most stark example of the women in Heat being victimized by the men in their lives.  McCauley breaks his own rules about keeping personal relationships at arm's length, & lies out of loneliness to Eady, & ultimately drags her into the middle of his world, forcefully even.  Eady is guilty only of a little loneliness of her own, & believing McCauley's lies; I don't see any her as anything but sympathetic."
flicks,3dso1g,dilyam,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps demonizing was a little too harsh, but I just didn't really like most of the female characters. Not because they were female, just because of their behavior. Justine seemed whiny and unfaithful. I'm not saying she didn't have proper motives to her behavior, but Pacino comes off as a hero of sorts, and when you have a character that slows down the hero in his goals, one (I) may tend to dislike that character. That's how I saw her.  I didn't like Charlene or Kilmer's character, so I don't think it was specific to her being a woman. She was just irresponsible and annoying.  I was actually referring to Eady as the most innocent one, because she starts her relationship with McCauley not knowing about his life of crime and then gets sucked into it(I kind of forgot about Portman when writing that) ."
flicks,3dso1g,One_Shot_Finch,6,Mon Jul 20 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"I watched a ton this week so I'll keep my thoughts as brief as possible.  Deep in the Dark - Colin Theys, 2014: This film started out somewhat promising but quickly grew worse as it progressed. The soundtrack was really cheesy in a bad way and didn't fit the film at all. The story didn't make any sense and the big twist at the end is predictable yet still manages to be completely nonsensical. This movie was basically a 90 minute Goosebumps episode but not as funny. 4/10  Dark Summer - Paul Solet, 2015: I was mainly drawn to  this one because it had the kid from It Follows (Keir Gilchrist) in it. The writing and performances were ehh at best but the soundtrack and cinematography were pretty decent, and there was a nice little twist that I didn't see coming. Wasn't as bad as Deep in the Darkness but was mostly unremarkable. 5/10  Dumplings - Fruit Chan, 2004: Not much to say about this one. It had an interesting premise that I felt it delivered on. The cinematography was interesting. It was well written and acted. Nothing outstanding but it was a fun little film. 7/10  Flowers - Phil Stevens, 2015: This was a beautiful film. Well, it was actually really gory and sleazy, and all the house that it takes place in is in disrepair, covered in mold and insects. But in the strangest way it was really beautiful. To me it looks like an old, fucked up photograph. This is a surrealist horror film about six dead girls who wake up in the basement of their killers' house. It's entirely visual, as there's no dialogue. As I'm typing, I find this film really hard to talk about so I really do recommend you people check it out. There are some times where it drags (it's only around 80 minutes long) but for the most part it is consistently disgusting and depraved. 8/10  Would You Rather - David Guy Levy, 2012: I'll just start by saying this is a film that's really fun to watch. It's not very good, however. The acting is unremarkable to bad (Sasha Grey plays a character in this film. That's all I should have to say) and the writing is sub-par at times. But Jeffrey Combs, of Re-Animator fame, plays the villain and is an absolute joy to watch. It's worth watching just for him. The movie is basically a shittier version of Cheap Thrills. 6/10  Berberian Sound Studio - Peter Strickland, 2012: Much like Flowers, I find this to be very hard to talk about. It's great, I can say that. Just on audio and visuals alone, it's outstanding. But it is very bizarre. I'd recommend that anyone who reads this check the movie out. 9/10  The Driller Killer - Abel Ferrara, 1979: I've only seen one other film of Ferrara's (Ms. 45) and loved it. This was his first feature and his actually quite impressive. It's got this grimy, dirty atmosphere only made sleazier by the mean-spirited murder scenes. Ferrara's performance as the titular Killer is really creepy and gross. All in all this is the kinda film you'll want to take a shower after watching. 7/10  Faults - Riley Stearns, 2015: I watched this pretty much on a whim and was thoroughly impressed. The dark comedy hits almost all the time. It's got a really nice retro visual aesthetic. It's hard to talk about what was so good about this film without spoiling it, but I will say it takes a turn that I didn't see coming and it was masterfully done. Really liked this movie. Wouldn't be surprised if it's in my top 10 of the year near the end. 9/10  Creep - Patrick Brice, 2014: Basically the same as Faults, I watched this on a whim and was blown away. I don't normally like found footage but I felt that this movie was made better by the found footage style. It's incredibly simple. A guy takes a craigslist job to film another guy for a day, and right from the getgo, the guy isn't normal. The two aforementioned guys are the only characters in the film. Mark Duplass plays the creep and he is great. So great he outshines the main character, played by Patrick Brice (the director). Creep is one of the best mixes of horror and comedy that I've seen, at least in recent years. At times I was laughing, and other times I was thoroughly creeped out. Sometimes at the same time! There are some really unbelievable choices made by that main character, stuff that I couldn't ignore, but for what it was, this film was a simple, effective, and near-masterfully made found footage horror film. 8.5/10  Ant-Man - Peyton Reed, 2015: Of course, I just had to catch the latest Marvel heart-stopper on opening night! Except not really, I was invited by a friend. It was entirely adequate and entirely predictable, like every MCU film. The performances were eeh. Nothing special. Surprisingly enough, Michael Pena was the highlight of the film. Although he still just plays the token Mexican guy that he normally does. Some of the humor hit it out of the park, some if it fell flat. I was laughing at some parts that weren't supposed to be funny. The CGI for the most part was really eeh. Some of it looked really bad and some looked okay. Except there was a scene near the very end that looked AWESOME, and for a minute I was thinking that the film actually did something interesting and original. The villain is incredibly generic, although not fun-generic like Loki and Ronan. He was boring to watch until he became Yellow Jacket. Speaking of which, the fight scenes in this film were really fun to watch and it was interesting to see the way they played with Ant-Man's shrinking ability. I also liked the scenes where Michael Pena's character was explaining where he got the tips for jobs they could do. Although those bits were bittersweet, because they were edited like an Edgar Wright film, so they were fun to watch, but just reminded me that Edgar Wright probably could've made a much better film. All in all it was a really eeh movie. Looks like GotG is still the best and most interesting MCU movie. 6/10  Xtro - Harry Bromley Davenport, 1982: Really fun and bizarre sci-fi movie. Seriously, this might be the weirdest movie I've ever seen. It needs to be seen to be believed. The special effects are really good and the acting is surprisingly decent. I was expecting this movie to be so-bad-it's-good but I actually thought it was legitimately good. 8.5/10  28 Days Later (rewatch) - Danny Boyle, 2002: I love love love love this movie. Simply put, this is one of the best zombie movies, no, the best horror movies ever made. One of the few movies that actually scares me. Also, next to Romero's Night and Dawn of the Dead, it's the most influential zombie film ever. Every zombie film after Night/Dawn was leading up to 28 Days, and every zombie film after is derivative. It popularized the idea for zombie flicks that man is the real monster, which pretty much every post-28 Days zombie movie uses. Hell, from season 3 on, The Walking Dead almost exclusively uses human antagonists. And, disregarding it's influence on horror, 28 Days is a masterfully made movie. The performances are top-notch. The screenplay is air-tight. It is beautifully shot and tightly edited. The early digital cameras it was shot with give it a gritty and suitable visual style. I could go on an on about why I love this movie, but I've already gone on way longer than I meant to. I throw the 10/10 rating a lot, but this is a film that truly deserves it, IMO. 10/10"

I loved it - taut, suspenseful, but slow and methodically paced, complex and smart, distant and uncompromising. I'd seen Z before and Missing, as well as The Battle of Algiers, which was written also by Franco Solinas. State of Siege ranks up there with them - a harsh, idealistic and realistic moral and political exposé. One of the best films I've seen in quite a long time."
flicks,3dso1g,rycar88,4,Sun Jul 19 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"Bad Grandpa dir. Jeff Tremaine (2013)  As a spinoff movie to the Jackass films, Bad Grandpa stars Johnny Knoxville mocked up to be Irvine Zisman, an inappropriate 86 year old curmudgeon who, through a series of events, ends up traveling from Nebraska to North Carolina with his grandson. In Borat fashion, the movie is built on a ton of episodic hidden-camera hijinks featuring both Knoxville and the kid with real world people. Some of the reactions are worth it enough, but the pranks are hit-or-miss on their set ups (the one showstopping winner is the final prank, which I don't want to give away.) With such a limited premise, the movie got repetitive fairly quick, and I felt like Knoxville used the old character getup as an excuse to be safe and lazy. 5/10  Spy Dir. Paul Fieg (2015)  As far as action-comedy goes, Spy is a complete success. It is funny and entertaining from start to finish, and features a whole host of memorable characters and scenes - the best being Susan Cooper, the deskbound CIA analyst-turned-agent played by Melissa McCarthy. Rose Byrne is also great as the bitchy villain. The whole movie works, but it also falls to many of the tropes that make up the genre - but I guess those tropes are also what make the movie so entertaining. 7.5/10  Grandma's Boy dir. Nicholaus Goossen (2006)  Alright, I hated this movie. I don't get the cult-acclaim of this being an under-appreciated comedy. There is nothing this movie brings to the table that is new or funny. I guess it's one of the few movies that represents game-dev culture, but it's not like it even does a very good job at that. It also plays the ""everyman-hero"" Adam Sandler trope, where the only reason we have to root for the guy is due to the fact he is the main character. And as a character he kind of sucks. Also the movie is not as edgy as it thinks it is. I guess one good thing is David Spade gets to make a quick cameo where he actually gets to be funny, which made me remember that at one point Spade used to be a pretty good actor-comedian. But that's it. 2/10"

flicks,3dso1g,false10,5,Sun Jul 19 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949) Full of surprisingly dry humor: there's only one outright comical death. I watched a dubbed version, so I got the impression that I missed some subtleties/wordplay. Still a fun little flick. 7/10  Choke (Clark Gregg, 2008) It seems unfair, but how can you not compare the second film adaptation of a Palahniuk novel to Fight Club? Both feature a bitter protagonist, who visits a self help group without the commitment and hangs around crazy, or at least quirky people. Unfortunately, only one features the visual work and sharp sense for satire of a great director. It feels like Gregg didn't want to go overboard with the style, out of respect for the hard-to-translate-tone of the novel, but a ridiculous failure would have been more interesting. It's a solid film, just a little boring compared to what it could have been. 6/10  Quai des Orfèvres (Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1947) It's impressive how well Clouzot's pacing and editing holds up. It almost never feels ""slow"" like most older films do for a modern audience. He's also fantastic at creating fully fledged characters. For example, although it's not directly connected to the main story, we learn that the inspector takes care of a black child he brought home from his time in the military. It's giving depth to an otherwise not too remarkable character. Clouzot's world is grim, full of lies, jealousy and unfulfilled lust, but he has sympathy for his characters and their flaws. 8/10  Kung fu (Stephen Chow, 2004) Rewatch. A Looney Tunes episode in the form of a 70s kung fu flick. You can't help but laugh at all the absurdity thrown in your face and the  disinterest in most story conventions. Why not also throw in a bunch of movie references? Like most comedies, it loses some laughs the second way around, but still very funny. 8/10  Criss Cross (Robert Siodmak, 1949) Who put that unnecessary voice-over in there? It doesn't even help with the aimlessness of the first 30 minutes or so. Gladly it finds its focus after that and picks up quickly, culminating in a fantastic, gut-punching ending. 8/10"
flicks,3dso1g,clearncopius,5,Sun Jul 19 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"The Day the Earth Stood Still- (1951), Robert Wise- This is a political commentary film as much as it is a science fiction film. An alien comes to Earth, seeing how it has recently developed atomic energy that could be used to travel to his own planet and other planets in the universe. Yet Earth is a dangerous planet, constantly involved in wars and there is great tension among countries. The message of the alien, and of the film, is this: Humans are violent people, and unless nations stop threatening war and destruction, there can be no peace. An appropriate message, especially considering the film was released during the Cold War era. It is a classic of science fiction, but to carp only a little, the ending is seem rushed and abrupt. But perhaps that was the intention of the film; to have the audience be left with this one final message. Also, very advanced special effects for the time period. 8.5/10  Deliverance (1972), John Boorman- I can’t remember the last time a film made me so uncomfortable. Deliverance does not feel like a wild ride down a river, it feels more like you are drifting calmly through the water in a canoe, at night, without a paddle, and you can hear the sounds of the wilderness closing in around you. It is the type of movie that makes you crawl out of your skin and go insane. Which is exactly what this film is about. Four city men go on a weekend canoe trip through rural Georgia, and expect to encounter the forces of nature, but are left victims to the forces of man. These three civilized men are then broken apart and turned to savages, not by the area around them, but by the people around them. It is about the degeneration of society as a whole. Deliverance is a scream in the night that will haunt your thoughts for days after you viewed it. I’m not sure I particularly enjoyed this film, simply because it was so discomforting, but I can appreciate what it is about and what it does it does extremely well. 9/10  The Terminator (1984), James Cameron- James Cameron is the master of the popcorn flick. His films have all the essentials of a hot, buttery film that you watch twice in one night and once the next morning when you wake up on the couch. Cameron writes very poor dialogue, yet is able to make a few select lines that stand out from the rest of the film to become classics. His films lack substance, but are well made, and extremely entertaining. The worst scenes are the intimate moments of conversation between characters. In The Terminator I’m talking about the scene under the bridge and the scene in the motel, where it is just Sarah and Kyle alone together. Those scenes are hard to get through. But others when it’s just the Arnold reeking havoc on downtown Los Angeles? Amazing. Speaking of which, Arnold Schwarzenegger should have won an Oscar for his performance as the Terminator. He fits the role perfectly. There is no actor who could have portrayed the lifeless, deadly robot better than Arnie. 7/10  Infernal Affairs (2002), Andrew Lau, Alan Mak- This film begins by riding on two parallel lines. As it goes along both lines begin to slant. As the pace of this film rapidly increases, so does the slanting of the lines until they finally crash together to form a single line, and the audience doesn’t know if what they are seeing is one of the two lines from before that has just swallowed the other, or a completely different line all by itself. Infernal Affairs is a film of opposites. The police have a mole in a Hong Kong street gang, and the street gang has a mole in the police. The two spend the film trying to find each other out. When the film begins, there is clearly good and evil, yet when it ends, it is not made clear who are the heroes and who are the villains; who are the criminals and who are the victims. Infernal Affairs examines this theme while also providing an excellently directed and beautifully shot crime thriller. This is a film that will get your blood pumping and have you question your own morality. Great movie. I’ll go off topic for a bit, but I just want to discuss something real quick. As I’m sure most of you know, Martin Scorsese’s The Departed is a remake of this film. In my opinion they are both extremely well made films that do different things better than the other. The Departed’s strength is that it portrays the father/son relationships in the storyline much better, where in Infernal Affairs I didn’t feel like there were any strong connections. Infernal Affairs’ strength is that has a great, morally ambiguous ending while The Departed tries to tie everything together in a neat bundle for the viewer. I’d strongly recommend both of these films. If you haven’t seen either, watch The Departed first, simply because the elevator scene is better and needs to be seen fresh. 9/10  Ex Machina (2015), Alex Garland- This film is able to blur the lines between what is real and what is fake. What is human, and what is created by humans. The premise of the film is that the owner of a major technology company has created a robot with artificial intelligence, and sends one of his employees up to his house/research facility to test if the robot he created is truly a machine, or a living thing. The setting is key to the theme of the plot. The film takes place in the verdant, mountainous wilderness of Norway, yet the research base is a modern, metallic gray outpost filled with the latest technology. This contrast between these two drastically different things plays towards the artificial v.s natural theme. The rest of the film is about deception. Who is playing who? Are the characters deceiving the robot? Is it deceiving them? Are they deceiving each other? It is a triangle of blurred reality. Then by the end of the film, you realize that you are the subject of the test. The film wants you to think about this: Do you think this computer is really human? A frightening question, seeing as the way modern technology is advancing, we could be dealing with A.Is in the near future. It takes a while to break the ice, but Ex Machina is a good film once it gets rolling. 7.5/10  Inside Out (2015), Pete Doctor- Pixar strikes again. This extremely creative film is about a little girl and the five emotions (Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness and Disgust) that control her mind. It is simultainously a simple story about a girl who moves to a new town and feels lost, and an extravagantly great adventure about her emotions trying to deal with the situation. No pun intended when I say that Inside Out is a very emotional film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel. What Pixar manages to do so well is create movies with emotion that inflict that emotion on the audience no matter what the age. Inside Out is a film that will shoot you into the stratosphere with it’s imaginative creativity and then bring you back down to Earth with it’s emotional reality. This is soul film at it’s finest. Also, did you get the Chinatown joke? Because I got the Chinatown joke. 9.5/10  Film of the Week: Inside Out"
flicks,3dso1g,Trionout,8,Sun Jul 19 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"Citizen Kane - Saw this at a theater last Sunday. You all know this one, I don't have have anything to add.    Salo - I watched this because A) I had the DVD sitting in my shelf for a while, B) a friend of mine recommended me several times and C) it's kind of an obligatory movie. I didn't like it. Pasolini's direction is good, but too cold and distant. Sure, one could say he's trying to be cold and distant, but it looked like he was holding himself back. Also, after a while, the movie gets really repetitive, and after the first hour you're pretty much already anesthesiated, so the second half is nowhere near as impactful."
flicks,3dso1g,montypython22,6,Sun Jul 19 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'll chime in here, too, because I am a huge fan of the work of Pier Paolo Pasolini, the most fascinating figure in all of Italian cinema. (I'm copying my response from a conversation I've had in /r/movies before, but let it be known that I'm approaching this with a background in watching Pasolini's other films and reading some of the philosophical texts Pasolini bases his adaptation of De Sade on.)  This is quite a slippery subject to get into, particularly because there are so many things one has to juggle with while watching Salo. Essentially, on the surface-meaning level, it is a condemnation against what Pasolini himself referred to as ""the new fascist state."" He was dismayed with the mechanization of the human spirit through censorship, sexual oppression, and especially consumer culture. Just before Salo, Pasolini made a trilogy of loose adaptations of classic literature texts (Canterbury Tales, Decameron, and The Arabian Nights) called the Trilogy of Life. However, Pasolini eventually repudiated this trilogy because he, in good conscience, found that the idealization of the human body and the spirit he portrays in those movies does not exist anymore....if it ever existed at all. He was disheartened by the political, social, and cultural turmoil that plagued Italy at the time. Remember, this was a man who (only 10 years earlier) was making humanist/neorealist movies like The Gospel According to St. Matthew (perhaps the most accurate representation of Jesus Christ's philosophy in all of cinema) and Accatone. So a man who goes from this to making something like Salo is not an ignorant nor an ignoble nor a banal, unartistic person at all. He had a long fall; his soul was crushed by the wave of consumerism and moral putrification of society around him, and Salo can be considered both his final howl of pain and his last defiance against such a society.  He KNEW there would be tremendous backlash against the movie; no one just appropriates Sade's work and expects it to be perfectly understood. The movie is plagued with disturbing implications about how an audience voyeuristically reacts to it: that final sequence where the children are systematically tortured to death is chilling, not only due to its content, but also due to the camera gaze. It merges the perspective of the audience with the perspective of the libertines. At first, the acts displayed in the beginning of the picture are shocking and brutal to a core. Now, by the end, because we have been exposed so much to it, we react to it with a certain detachment and (perhaps even worse) domesticate the killings. In the same way as Pasolini was disturbed by the pacification of modern culture by decrepit commercialization and consumerist dogma, so, too, does he brilliantly evoke that same type of pacification in relation to the acts that De Sade only described in his book.  That repetition you're describing is EXACTLY what makes this film so chilling. After the first half, you've sort of grown to accept these atrocities and you're numbed to it. Once you realize that, you're taken aback: that you've grown to accept girls getting scalped and boys having their tongues cut off and penises burned to a crisp. This is what those bystanders in 1944 Fascist Italy felt like when they saw the Fascists attacking villagers near the tail-end of WWII and did absolutely nothing to stop it. This is what those German and Polish eyewitnesses did when Hitler and his cronies rounded up millions of Jews, gypsies, etc. and took them to concentration camps and burned them by the handful. They did nothing; they stand by and idly watch; they hear stories of the atrocities committed, and they're shocked at first, but as the war years go on and as more people die, they become ""used"" to it.  Pasolini is interested in the process of desensitization, about how people turn from outright horror to passive acceptance of the same set of horrific events.  It is also a brutal allegory on totalitarianism. In this one chateau, Pasolini creates an entire society: the secret police (the ""fuckers"", or guards), the fascist heads-of-state (the Duke, President, Bishop, and Magistrate), the generals (the three madams who tell the lascivious stories which get the fascist-libertines off) the bystanders (the Pianist), and the oppressed, voiceless majority (the young victims) who have no say in the society but by whom, paradoxically, the society cannot function without.   It also has a bevy of complicated characters in it. A lot is to be said about the Pianist, who it seems was only contracted because she can play the piano well. What does that say about art in this fascist society? Can it exist in such a state of raw savagery? Or what about her suicide? Is it a final act of rebellion against this fascist state: establishing free-will in a society which refuses to consider free will? Or is it just a pure outpouring of grief: a footnote which sadly gets lost to modern audiences among all the violence and disgusting acts Pasolini portrays?  On the surface-level, it is a condemnation of the new ""fascist state"" of modern societies: consumerism, political oppression, degradation of art, etc. However, perhaps on a much subtler level, Salo is a ripping satire on the way we treat art and movies in general. It is always fascinating to me to record people's reactions of Salo. The person above who says: ""I've seen Salo and was hugely disappointed. They were making it out like this is the king of disturbing movies while in fact it's pretty boring. The violence was pretty tame."" (Note: this was on the original /r/movies post that I responded to, but I've put it here again, because I find it a relevant reaction.) First of all, the violence is the means to make the point. But even more disturbingly, what do we make of a society which encourages the proliferation of movies like A Serbian Film or disturbing ""niche"" horror movies? How is violence in film somehow mitigated because ""it's all just an illusion"" and, unless it's a snuff film or something, the actors are fine in real life?  It saddens me when people gloss over Salo as being one of a myriad of disturbing pictures made purely to disturb and nothing else. If anything, Salo reveals the demons in the moviegoer that other films normally refuse to do--and it does this in a profoundly sophisticated way. My only wish for people wanting to see Salo is that they read up on some of the philosophers who talk about it (perhaps De Sade or Simone De Beauvoir's wonderful short essay, ""Must we Burn De Sade?"") If you go in cold-turkey or, worse, expect nothing but the disturbing naughty bits, not only are you not engaging with a work that Pasolini has crafted, but you are confirming the pessimistic stereotypes that Pasolini attacks the viewer with in Salo.  EDIT: Grammar."

flicks,3dso1g,Rhetorical_Answers,7,Sun Jul 19 14:49:53 2015 UTC,"High Noon (1952)  Simple, but solid story. While I'm not a fan of all the performances, Gary Cooper is great in the central role and largely carries the movie. Despite its short length, the film feels somewhat repetitive, partly because of the constant repetition of the main theme. I get that this is somewhat the point, but I felt it was repeated too often. The ending is somewhat anti-climatic, but it's partly why I like it. 6/10  Cinderella (1950)  The most classic of fairy tales as told by someone who truly loves anthropomorphized mice and slapstick comedy. Like in a true fairy tale, the interest does not lie in how the prince and Cinderella interact, because it’s a given they will fall in love if they meet. So the conflict lies in getting the two of them together. The prince is one of the blandest characters in film history and while Cinderella herself isn't the most interesting of characters, the second Dinsey princess is an improvent over the first one if not only because of the voice acting. It’s always a balancing act for the comic relief characters between funny and annoying and while the mice are closer to the line than ideal, they do not cross it in my opinion. The story is well told and is in general an entertaining watch. The animation looks great, although I'm not a fan of the realistically drawn eyes which look kind of creepy. Cinderella is nothing special, but it is what you’d expect. 6/10  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)  I feel like I watched a miniseries instead of a movie. Not a moment was dull and there was even a bit that was a bit rushed towards the end. The story is very compelling and you never know where it’s going next, but yet you feel there’s only one way It can end. The three (or two) main characters are fleshed out very well, there’s not a single act one of them commits that’s against their character and the performances are just magnificent. The score is fantastic and while the main theme is often repeated, it’s not overused and only used at the appropriate times. All the plot points make sense, although they’re not always probable, you feel like they are possible. The film also looks gorgeous and there are few things I can appreciate more than long, wide shots in westerns and in that regard TGTBATU definitely delivers. There are only a couple of minor negative things I can say about this film. The audio isn’t always that good, mostly when Tuco’s speaking (I read it’s because some parts of the extended edition weren’t dubbed until many years later). It’s also mildly annoying that a lot of voices are dubbed. The fights could have been choreographed btter. And the last negative thing I can say is that like I mentioned before there’s a part that feels a bit rushed. But these are very small things wrong with a truly great film. 10/10"

flicks,3dso1g,cattymills,5,Sun Jul 19 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"Anatomy of a Murder (1959) directed by Otto Preminger  ★★★1/2  Anna Karenina (1935) directed by Clarence Brown  With the benefit of years of critical discussion to single out all the multitudinous classic of Classical Hollywood, studio filmmaking I often find myself forgetting that the era (I think) was pretty reviled as it happened, and Anna Karenina serves as a perfect example of why that was. It's super generic. All those rules of Classical Hollywood style and direction -- medium establishing shots followed by crosscutting, never transgressing the 180 degree axis, clear lighting, etc. -- are painfully followed to an inexpressive tee. Each scene exists only to push the story forward in a heavy handed, superficial way. The dialogue has zero character. If it wasn't for the fame of Greta Garbo, this could be a completely anonymous work. It's not completely worthless -- the story of Anna Karenina, as chained down as it is in the film, is clearly a great one; the opulent glamour of the richest is alluring; and you can see at times what made Garbo so famous. But, when your 90 minute film is dragging, something's gone wrong.  ★★  Babel (2006) directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu  Babel was definitely the kind of film that had to win me over (due to mostly superficial reasons). Naming a film Babel and it having the kind of conceit it does is inherently presumptuous, and what I've heard of Iñárritu regarding Birdman only added to that. And you know what, Babel is definitely pretentious. The presentation of it is of the present day ""THIS IS AN ART MOVIE"" kind, it doesn't say anything in comparison to its lofty title and narrative, and on top of that it manages to bring up all these present day issues without really saying anything about them.   But, what can I say—Babel nevertheless won me over. Some dumb plot contrivances aside, the narrative is handled really well; it manages to deftly, clearly navigate the unwieldy amount of individual stories by playing around with the chronological order for simple ease and sometimes emotional effect and it's really well paced—I was fairly enthralled for almost two-and-a-half hours. Not a lot of movies can do that. Babel really gets you into the emotional state of its characters, and there are a lot of varied emotions—from heartwarming to heart-wrenching—many intense. And, while the subtext may not be present at a richly rewarding level, there is something said, without being naive or cynical, about communication and empathy to get over our seemingly ingrained hostility towards one another. I can get behind that.  ★★★1/2  Three Colors: Blue (1993) directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski  I know comparisons are the devil and all, but in some ways Three Colors: Blue reminded me of The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover: both are slow paced, capture beautiful environments in a way that makes them even more beautiful, have lush orchestral scores, feature steady and economic direction, weld contrived (and I don't mean that pejoratively, here) formalism onto a plotless narrative; and are undertaken with the utmost gravity. They're both skillfully made at each individual level in an overall cohesive style that certainly held my attention -- sometimes more -- throughout. And because it isn't tasteless, is shorter by a half hour (not bending its glacial pace to the breaking), and actually successfully accomplishes its narrative goal Blue is undoubtedly better than The Cook.... But, I still can't help but feel that this solemn style is destined to just stamp out every last vestige of emotion in whatever film its found in -- Blue isn't an exception to this. While the film definitely wants a lack of emotion for a bit, it quickly starts building towards an emotional catharsis that it just couldn't achieve for me -- meaning that the narrative climax is cerebral, when it really ought to be emotional.  ★★★1/2  Captain Phillips (2013) directed by Paul Greengrass   Captain Phillips is a fine film -- just fine, though. It's taut, but nowhere near as atmospheric as it could be considering the terrifying, hostile expanse of the ocean, piracy, and hostage situations. It pays lip service to the circumstances that drove the Somali fishermen into piracy, but it doesn't expound in any way on the hilariously unfair and disparate (from the Americans) conditions and its heart and attention remains firmly on the Americans. Tom Hanks does give a great, memorable performance, but he's also given so much more to work with than his counterpart in Barkhad Adbi. And so on. I feel like the ending is a great microcosm of Captain Phillips; it's great that the killing of three humans isn't treated as a rousing victory and that the film doesn't ignore the emotional trauma of it, but you wish that it could express the tragedy through the cruel hand the Somalis have been dealt and actual characterizations of them rather than solely through a white American screaming.  ★★★"

It's very forgettable and no where near as funny as the first. Has Station though.  The best part of the film was the credits. Those were pretty funny.   Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau (2014) David Gregory  Interesting documentary about the crazy production and all its problems. I thought it was pretty good. The concept art that Richard Stanley did with the artist was awesome. If the film went how he hoped, it could have been awesome. I really wish they showed the Cthulhu/octopus man.   Muscle Shoals (2013)  Greg 'Freddy' Camalier  Fantastic documentary about the Swampers, Fame studio and the Muscle Shoals sound. A must see film for all music fans. I was raised on Motown, Stax, Atlantic & Chess records. Even then I was aware that places like Fame, Studio One and Electric Lady were special places where special things happen. It's some of the best music that humans have ever made. It's hard for me not to get romantic about this stuff. Music is one of the few places I've been able to find something that's very close to actual magic. So glad to see Jimmy Cliff show up.   Deadly Adoption (2015) Rachel Goldenberg  I loved this. My wife is a huge Lifetime fan. I've sat next to her as she watches her trash for countless hours. This film understands everything about that shit and what makes them shitty. It's a perfect blend of mimicry and mockery. I was laughing from the asinine closeup as the dock brakes up to the ending dance scene. If I was sitting with my wife and this just showed up with out notice (which was the original plan) it would have been amazing."

I was pleasantly surprised that a young Martin Landau was in this (who I thought pulled off an excellent creepy henchman). Overall, I really enjoyed the chaotic scenes where Grant keeps getting pulled deeper and deeper into his mistaken role, especially the scene at the U.N.  The romantic subplot felt a little contrived and their intimate scene on the train in the beginning looked awkward. The final shot of Grant pulling the girl up and then the transition to the train was so bizarre. I'm still unsure if I liked this or not. On one hand, you don't have the inevitable plot wrap-up like in Psycho but you don't need it because there's nothing to wrap-up. However, it still felt weird."

Mediocre villain played by a great actor but written horribly? Check. Standard story? Check. Inoffensive and serviceable score? Check. Shoehorned in fan service/tie-ins? Check. Half-baked genre elements? Check.  The small scale was more than welcome after the absolute mess that was Avengers 2, but still the dramatic elements fell very flat. The performances were mostly fine except Evangeline Lily who was pretty awful. The action/small scale sequences were awesome though, and a lot of the humor hits really well. The last 30 minutes or so were immensely enjoyable but everything leading up to that was so... just standard. There is nothing that is all that bad about it, but a movie called Ant Man should be a lot more unique and creative.  Minions   Really boring and depressing. Very little of the humor hits, the story is absolute balls, Sandra Bullock and the villain-con are completely wasted, the human characters in general suck, and the ending had me groaning. It's cute and inoffensive overall but barely anything really worked. I really liked Despicable Me 1 and 2 but this fell absurdly flat.   An Honest Liar  Fascinating documentary about James Randi and the nature of deception. I had already been a huge fan of Randi before and I learned a lot more about him from this. The sequence with Peter Popoff is more of a ""heist movie"" than anything in Ant-Man. Really strongly recommend.  A Bug's Life  Watched in preparation for Ant-Man lol. Really cute and funny movie that had me chuckling throughout. One of Pixar's weaker movies but still really great.   it Follows  This movie is so fucking cool. Absolutely love it.

flicks,3dso1g,yellow_sub66,5,Sun Jul 19 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"I missed last week so I guess I'll do quick ones for them too.  Almost Famous (2000) dir.Cameron Crowe Honestly, I didn't love this. I know it's a fan favourite and it seems like a film everyone is meant to love but, although it was okay, with a few outstanding scenes, I thought the writing was flat and a lot of the characters were both one dimensional parodies of common stereotypes of the time and sometimes were played off for jokes.   Philip Seymour Hoffman was incredible and the lead was also decent. It obviously came from the heart of Crowe, however his heart seemed to be filled with common cliches and predictable plot points. The ending was poignant and a nice subversion; definitely the best Crowe film I've seen, but for me nothing special. The music was great. 6.5/10  Nightcrawler (2014) dir.Dan Gilroy Tense, thrilling, interesting characters and stunningly shot. Gyllenhall gives a captivating performance in his role as a crime scene photographer. It was subtly written with extreme care dedicated to building his and developing the other characters. He did not have any development, maybe justified by his antihero character type .   I found the ending extremely disappointing, it felt sudden and rushed, like they realised they only had ten seconds of film left and only tied up one character's story, and badly at that. The film did have a lot to say about the state of journalism and America and it did it, it was all on the surface and no deeper, however it was apt and agreeable, especially living outside America, looking in the way TV journalism especially is handled seems alien and bizarrely anti-news. 7.5/10  Frances Ha (2012) dir.Noah Baumbauch Just okay, it was really just a standard quirky indie comedy, funny at times but at others not. France's was not a completely absorbing lead however she was an interesting enough character to keep you engaged. Weirdly, the film seemed to have nothing to say about anything, not even a simple moral message as far as I could tell, I'd love to be proved wrong. The black and white was neither a hindrance nor a benefit and was really just there; the film was fairly pretty though. 6/10  Unforgiven (1993) dir.Clint Eastwood Brilliant. I didn't know this was written by David Webb People's of Blade Runner but I was not surprised by the end. What a great film this was. A realistic, gritty, no nonsense western with stunning visuals and amazing performances from everyone involved. It was a refreshing change from even some the other great westerns to have a fleshed out main character and a story centred largely on the people and the effects of the Cowboys and the time they were common on the normal people (the film is set as the Wild West era draws to a close, the funniest and best way of showing this was by having a fat English biographer following the cowboy he saw as the most interesting).   The second act was a little slow and the film would not have worked without the lack of action despite this being the main cause for the slight slowness. The third act however was as far as I can tell, perfect. The film seemed like the perfect curtain call for the genre, a sort of bookend for every film about the west at the time. It was, to use a contradiction of sorts, lovingly critical of the genre and Eastwood's own career. Watch it. 9/10  letterboxd"
flicks,3dso1g,heccaz,7,Sun Jul 19 10:25:37 2015 UTC,"Ant-Man. While this film did fall for the same tropes that are currently synonymous with Marvel, I found it to be the most unique MCU film to date. The stylistic choices made, particularly with the shrinking scenes, are some of the boldest and creative bits of filmmaking in the franchise. I almost wish it didn't have to be a Marvel film, cause it really didn't want to be one. Tone was a nice balance of action and comedy, but once again the drama was stiff. I found Hope and Scott's chemistry very forced and at times, Hope's character just felt pointless. That being said, Hank Pym's character was a surprisingly great addition to the plot. Overall I rank it as one of the better Marvel films. 7.5/10  Amy. As a massive Amy Winehouse fan, this was both a good watch, and a hard one. Even for people unfamiliar with her music, this documentary will be well received and that's because it is well done. It is quite linear, as most biographical doccos are, but I was engaged with it the whole way through, though I suppose there is some bias. I didn't love that the film only relied on Archive footage with voice overs to tell the story, because I'm a fan of the talking head, and often the archive footage in this was of a terrible quality. I also didn't like that the film ended with her death, and didn't take us back once more to what she should be remembered for: Her musical legacy. Despite that, it is both an interesting music documentary, and a really tragic story of corruption. I recommend it to any Winehouse or documentary fan. 8/10  Minions. The kids loved it, so I guess this movie did what it needed to do, and therefore I can't really hate it… Even that being said, I really didn't hate it. The animation and character design were SUPERB, and this really helped sell the physical humour of the film, which was actually rather funny. Biggest issue with this film is that about half way through it got unbelievably boring. The characters were all so 1 dimensional, and the plot started out pretty intriguing, then fizzled after the introduction. The movie could have been a pretty decent short, but they decided to phone in the second half so they could release it as a feature length for that sweet, sweet minion money. So, while the kids did love it, I just ended up finding it boring past the first act. 5/10  Small Soldiers. This is one hell of a nostalgic film for me. I loved it as a kid, and still love it now. It's a quintessential good vs. bad film for kids. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend. Great action and humour in this film, making it a good watch for kids and parents alike. However, the thing I love most about this film is its unconventional villains. American soldiers are the BAD GUYS, hell bent on killing the Gorgonites, a peaceful group of aliens. It's unpatriotic and an interesting anti-war commentary disguised as a kid's film.9/10   The Matrix. This week featured my annual watch of The Matrix. Obviously this film is fantastic and well loved by many, but something I noticed about it this time watching is just how well it uses the heroes journey/three act structure. It comes off so well, that by the time Neo is going to rescue Morpheus you feel like you have been on a huge, surreal journey along side Neo. The second act (Neo learning about the Matrix) is such a solid trip mostly because the Wachowski's created such a unique and gripping universe. Another thing I noticed is that the stylised action has just never been paralleled. Not even by its sequels. So yeah, lots of love for this film. 10/10     Captain America and The Winter Soldier. Watched these two back to back and I really have to say that Cap is easily my favourite series in the MCU. Both these films nail the tone, and both in different and distinguishing ways, despite being in the same series. For CA, the camp version of WW2 was like an old Captain America comic brought to life. While WS modernised the comic book character realistically within the Marvel universe. I also commend Chris Evans because Steve Rodgers is portrayed perfectly. I have to say though, that WS is my favourite. It's plot is actually intelligent to the point that it almost becomes a political thriller. It uses humour more modestly than a lot of the other MCU films. It's stunts and fight choreography are off the fucking chain. It's got the best cinematography of the franchise. And most of all, it's pacing and tone are so spot on. I think CA's pacing wasn't nearly as on point as WS.  Winter Soldier is on my top 5 superhero films, and my number 1 for the MCU.  Captain America 8/10 The Winter Soldier 9/10"

You say it deliberately contrived tragedy as a plot device, but I'm not sure what that means? Every movie contrives some sort of plot device to keep the story moving, and because Dancer's is maybe more extreme than a usual film you didn't like it?   Not trying to sound condescending, I'm genuinely interested in what you mean by that? But as far as manipulative and slow-paced, those are von Trier staple's so I can't fault you there"

Dancer in the Dark was just too deliberate in painting Selma a victim that its tragedy turned easily into exploitation. That is von Trier's shtick, but all his other films feature subject matters that are at least interesting to explore, while Dancer in the Dark relies solely on some unbelievably sophomoric criticism of American capitalistic culture to drive its plot.  I think Dogville did everything that Dancer in the Dark was trying to do, but did it much better and had actual enjoyable acting."

It fit von Trier's fascination with victimhood and societal predation, but it's frustrating to me when a character drives themselves to despair for no reason and without any self-responsibility for it. This is one other reason why I much prefer Dogville to Dancer - the main character at least had a reason to endure her suffering (for her own greater protection and escape from her father.)"

I was just a bit uncomfortable with how it handled that subject matter, it was on a knife's edge as it is but there were moments where it went way too hard and became ridiculous.  I think the stand out was that entire conversation between the kid and his dad about ejaculation. It's going for shock gross out value at the most extreme level, and it becomes so painful to watch that the value of it was lost on me.  I suppose the film is polarising so I guess this is just a case of varying mileage. I know some people think it's one of the best films of the last decade, I guess I see what they see in it, it's just not for me.

Chandor  Based on the start of the 2008 financial crisis, this had all the makings of a great film. There was plenty of great acting talent on display, and Kevin Spacey stood out as usual. Everyone played their parts well, although I think Demi Moore was a bit underused.  But somehow the film was still a bit boring. A lot of terminology was used which went straight over my head, even as someone with a passing interest in economics.  7/10  Exam (2009) dir. Stuart Hazeldine  Low budget British film ($600k).  Interesting concept, where 8 people in a room are in a job interview without knowing what to do or how to proceed. The suspense and tension build up was amazing, and somehow believable too, since the plot included a deadly virus which had infected some of the group.  Really enjoyed this.

When I finally got around to watching it I realized it's really just a supernatural murder mystery, and I love murder mysteries."

flicks,3dso1g,mbrochh,4,Sun Jul 19 04:14:27 2015 UTC,"Chappie. Didn't like it. The robot was really amazing. I loved him from the first minute, which of course is the point of the movie. Unfortunately, everything else in this movie is just total shit. It is easily (and shockingly) the ugliest movie I have seen in years. Some of the outdoor shots look unbelievably low-budget and amateurish. I don't think that it ever happened to me before that I was taken out of the movie by it's sheer ugliness. So, uuhm.. if you make a movie (a visual thing) and it looks like shit, maybe you should have written a book instead. Turns out the plot is shit as well, my twelve year old self could have written that script as a school assignment. Flat characters, contrived plot, nothing really makes any sense. I'm afraid Blomkamp simply is not a very good movie maker. 5/10  Antman. What can I say. I'm suffering from severe Marvel movie fatigue. I just came for the nachos, left my brain at the entrance, laughed three or four times, left the cinema and immediately forgot everything I just saw. The movie fails the Bechdel test, the main character is so uncharismatic, I don't even know who that actor is (and I don't have the urge to find out). As in all Marvel movies, there is zero chemistry between Hope and Antman, the whole first half of the movie is boring (superhero origin stories are always the same shit, I'm sick of seeing them), the ""heist"" is as unimaginative as a heist can get and Michael Peña steals the show. 6/10"
flicks,3dso1g,One_Shot_Finch,6,Sun Jul 19 10:20:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Ant Man is unremarkable, it failing the Bechdel test is a pretty shitty reason for it being bad. You might be surprised at what great films fail it and what utter shit passes it. Not a good way to gauge the quality of a film, and, in my opinion, not a good way of even gauging a film's writing."

flicks,3dso1g,akanefive,2,Sun Jul 19 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"So many posts already!  Continuing my Bond marathon: Live and Let Die 1973 dir. Guy Hamilton Roger Moore's first outing as Bond. He gets off to a really strong start. The quippy gentleman spy persona is already fully formed from the first glimpse of Moore's Bond. He's confident, athletic, and charismatic. (I'm left wondering why the producers didn't just try and cast him when Connery quit the role the first time.) The film was made two years after Diamonds Are Forever but the differences are night and day. The main draw (besides the fantastic title song by Paul McCartney and Wings) is the climactic boat chase is about 10 minutes long, and upon rewatch, feels almost like a proto-Speilberg action scene. Every event is caused by something else. It's just really entertaining.   There are some problems watching this movie in 2015. For starters, all the villains are black (just like the novel), and there's something uncomfortable about the implication that everyone in Harlem is in league with the bad guy, including the cab drivers and waiters. And the female characters aren't portrayed in the most positive light. Bond is assisted by a female CIA agent early on who proves to be childish, inept, and ultimately working for the villain. That said, Jane Seymore have Yaphet Kotto are both fantastic, and their performances prop up some of the weaker elements in the script. Overall, the film is well worth the two hours. (3/4)  Kingsmen: The Secret Service 2015 dir. Matthew Vaughn This movie fits right in with the Bond marathon, so I'm glad I finally got around to seeing it. I really enjoyed it. It worked both as an over the top spy movie and as a commentary on the gritty spy movies that are popular these days. I think this movie proves that, with the right direction, an over the top spy movie can work really well. I thought the fight choreography and action sequences were really entertaining. Colin Firth was fantastic as always, and Sam Jackson actually reminded me quite a bit of Yaphet Kotto in Live and Let Die. All in all, really entertaining - a nice weekend of spy movies for me. (3/4)"
flicks,3dso1g,Opsva,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:56:36 2015 UTC,"Creep (2014)  A cameraman-for-hire goes to a vacation home and becomes uncomfortably involved in the feature. Lots of effective jump scares, darkly funny and Mark Duplass is so good at being creepy, it's kind of offputting.   The Station Agent (2004) A laconic train enthusiast (Peter Dinklage) inherits a train depot from a deceased friend, and makes some more along the way. It was kind of formulaic, at times the humor was a little too dry for me, and it seemed to exacerbate certain aspects of characters for cheap humor/drama.   Horns (2013) Harry Potter is a suspect in his girlfriend's murder, but grows horns and people begin to make weird confessions to him. Asides, from the main character being entirely unsympathetic, and Harry Potter's American accent grating at best, the cinematography was lovely.  Batman Returns (1992) Batman vs. the Penguin, Catwoman & Christopher Walken! Tim Burton's Batman movies are my favorite Batman movies, and they're so cheesy I love them. Michelle Pfeifer as Catwoman is a riot. Danny DeVito as the Penguin is great. And, well, I love Michael Keaton. The only downside to this film is Christopher Walken, because I can't stand him."
flicks,3dso1g,the5and10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"Jurassic World - Yes, the characters were shallow, the story was predictable, and the plot was downright ridiculous. That being said, I had a lot of fun with this movie. Maybe it's just the idea of seeing John Hammond's original vision fully realized or the fact that I'm a sucker for a good theme park but I felt like the world was so well fleshed out. By ""world"", I mean the resort. I was surprised by how violent some scenes were. There were moments when even I was a little taken aback and I'd consider myself pretty desensitized to on-screen violence. Whoever cut the trailer together somehow made the movies' cheesiest lines seem even cheesier than they were in context. The verdict? It's dumb summer fun at its best. Don't take it too seriously and you should be able to enjoy it.  John Wick - Nice little revenge story that was more style than substance - though that's the point. Visually, I was continuously shocked (in a good way) by the level of gratuity in the kills. The movie did well establishing a motive for John while not dragging the audience into a sob story. One small detail I liked was the stylization of the subtitles. It's a small touch but it was fun. Good, concise action flick."
flicks,3dso1g,calcio1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Copied from my r/truefilm post  My last fortnight. Little's really blown me away lately at all, apart from Leviathan  Northern Soul (2014) Decent British indie film about the phenomenon of 'Northern Soul', when kids from grim towns in Britain's north got into obscure American soul music in the late 60s and 70s and the culture that grew around it. The story is a bit pat and predictable, but the production design is terrific as is the soundtrack, as you might expect. Big hit in the UK.  Pasazerka (1963) An unfinished Polish film released by friends of director Andrezj Munk after his death. Surely one of the first features to be set in Auschwitz, and naturally powerful for its examination of a female guard and her relationship with one of the prisoners. Interesting piece  Mediterranee (1963) Another experimental film from the 1001 Movies list. Various images around the med repeated in different ways. Fairly tedious  Leviathan (2014) Powerful Russian film that was nominated for Best Foreign Picture. Brilliant performances and beautiful photography in this slow look at a man gradually grinded down to ruin in Job-like fashion by the Russian state. I thought it was terrific.   The Third Man (1949) Caught the 4K restoration of this classic on the big screen. Such a great movie, almost every element is perfect or close to. Noticed a few details I missed the first time I saw it, and seeing it in a packed theatre brought out the comedy in the first couple of reels a lot more.   The Gospel According To Matthew (1964) Pasolini's look at the life of Christ. Nice photography, interesting soundtrack mixing contemporary gospel tunes with classical pieces, shot almost silent movie style at times. Enjoyed it, though barely a week after watching, I find it's little stayed with me.   Targets (1968) Peter Bogdanovich's debut, made for Roger Corman and featuring Boris Karloff because he owed Corman a couple of days' work. Great little B movie about a nutjob mass shooter, with supporting story of Karloff (basically playing himself) worried about his place in the movie industry and modern society, the two plots colliding at a drive-in movie theatre. A fun piece, and you can see instantly that Bogdanovich was a talent.  Before the Revolution (1964) Was left rather cold by this Bertolucci film about a bourgeois youngster struggling with his ideas of socialist revolution etc. Oh, and shagging his aunt. I guess Bertolucci was highlighting the pretensions of the type, of which he himself was one. Fairly forgettable  Ant-Man (2015) Enjoyable enough, though I would have liked to see what Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish had done with it had they not been booted off. A simpler, smaller (pardon the pun) Marvel superhero movie, with some nice funny moments and scenes. Far from essential but certainly worth watching  Man of Steel (2013) Having bought into the Comic-Con hype about the Batman v Superman trailer, I decided to watch this, having had no interest when it was released. Dully plodding, with almost zero light moments. Like many, I found Snyder's shaky-cam and washed-out colour palette irritating to the point of distraction. Zimmer's score is forgettable. And the city-levelling finale is almost comical, though I suppose they seem set to address that in the sequel, whether by design or as a reaction to the criticisms is another matter. Can't say it got me excited for number two  Black God, White Devil (1964) Another tale of poverty and religion from the Brazilian Cinema Novo. Splits into equal halves, peasant Manoel first following a black man he believes to be St Sebastian, then a white murderous bandit. Neither are great models. Maybe it was because the quality of copy I was watching was poor, but I found the often hand-held photography hard to watch, much like Man of Steel 50 years later. I wasn't grabbed by this one at all, though would maybe have to see a proper restored version.  Broadcast News (1987) A more interesting-than-average romantic comedy set in a newsroom in the 80s. I failed to appreciate it as much as most critics seem to, however. Awful soundtrack from Bill Conti, the guy who did Rocky. Holly Hunter - the ur-Liz Lemon as I saw a commenter on the Criterion site call her - is fairly annoying, though William Hurt and Albert Brooks as the two other points in the love triangle are good."

It's my favorite Jane Austen novel, and the film is perfectly cast and finds just the right note for adapting Austen I think. It has a great deal of empathy for its characters, but also retains Austen's wit and comic sensibility, which is something I find lacking in, say, Joe Wright's adaption of Pride and Prejudice (though I do really enjoy that film as well).

It does a great job of explaining a lot of concepts and techniques in film, getting somewhat into the philosophy behind film, covering all the bases of the development of film, and pointing out notable films and directors.   Some people do find Cousins' voice grating, though; I don't mind it, but if you can't get past it, he also released it as a book, titled simply The Story of Film."

To be honest, #9 and #10 are really just filler that I enjoyed but didn't love. I still have plenty of un-watched movies from 2000, and the rest that I have seen weren't too inspiring.

The Coens have created influential and acclaimed films of many different genres and styles- Academy Award winners, complex Cannes favorites, and cult films. Coppola had a great run, but really dropped off after the 70s, and I think that hurts him. However, John Carpenter's career dropped off too. John Cassavettes is the godfather of American Independent film, so he certainly deserves something. If I was making the list, I would have kept the Coens definitely, replaced Carpenter with Cassavettes... but I don't know between Chaplin and Copolla."

There is a lot of really great films that few people ever get around to watching, so I thought this may give you the push you need!  /r/TrueAnime, /r/Anime, /r/WatchingAnime, and /r/flicks will have a weekly Thursday thread to discuss the films. I'll be announcing the next week's review and posting a stream if possible. If you want to join in Nominations and Voting: Go here     Here is a text version of my blog post, incase clicking a link is difficult for some reason. :P  Night on the Galactic Railroad blog post  Directed by Gisaburou Sugii  Night on the Galactic Railroad (NotGR) is a 1985 film that gained a cult following over the years. Sugii made the film after finishing three seasons of the anime Nine, and followed by three seasons of Touch. He also released Tale of Gengi two years later. Both films are dark, brooding, and moral journies, while the series are light hearted sport romance. An interesting dynamic, but we’re not here for Sugii.  NotGR is a little secret among anime fans, and likely because it is terrifyingly difficult to get into or understand. This is a film that has a firm grasp on what it wants to do, and that thing is not to entertain. It wants heavy atmosphere, philosophy, sadness, and above all else is time. NotGR wants you to sit, fidget, let your mind wander, and then focus again, before it does anything at all.    Setting the Stage  Right from the opening we are hit with this oddly slow and twisty intro to set that idea.  Opening on the overhead shot of a school, we begin to drift down. Normally you would expect this to be a 10-30 second transition, even for detailed shots, but NotGR takes a full minute. Along with this is a windy, camera twisting, motion sickness ride across the single picture. All to get to the hallway.  It gave us nothing towards the plot, narrative, setting… nothing. It just wants the audience to understand the ride to expect, like a giant speed bump on the excitement highway. At first it can be quite boring, but by the end it felt perfect.  The tone is set, and we move into the classroom to meet our two main characters Giovanni and Campanella. Gio’s mind wanders as he looks at a map of the galaxy for the first time, halted as kids laugh thinking he’s asleep in class. This turns to establish that Gio’s father has gone North to work and fish, mainly through the children making fun and creating terrible rumors in the way kids do. Only Campanella stands for his friend, silently supporting him in the face of the bullies.  We go on to see the sorry state of affairs that Gio lives with. Brutally slow and tedious work at a printing shop, tired from the morning and the other part time job delivering papers, he earns just enough to bring food to the table. On the way home, he again drifts into a visual state of looking through the galaxy. This time by staring into a black rock. Then he moves on to return home with food for his mother.  His mother shares in the doubts and rumors about the father, and is so distant as to not even enter the same room. Gio is suffering but his hopes perk up with the plan to retrieve milk and visit with Campanella at the Festival of Lights. The dairy is empty though, save for a creepy old woman.  Gio is again rejected by his classmates at the festival, and it serves as the final straw. He leaves the village to die alone on a far away hill, suicide through social stigmata. At this moment, Gio’s wandering vision of the universe comes for a third time and he stands before the train. Thus begins the Night on the Galactic Railroad.    A Spiritual Journey of Lessons  From here, the story goes on through a series of symbolic scenes of the catharsis of death and religion. I thought at first that it was framed around a Buddhist mentality of rebirth, but it also features heavy Christian ideology. Perhaps fitting of a Japanese novelist writing about the death of his sister in 1924.  The episodic parts of the train ride each has some interesting portions to it. Things like the Bird Catcher, who spends his time capturing Herons that turn into candy, but let many of them die as they hit the ground. A wasteful and somewhat cold hearted circle of life.  The meeting with the humans, also caught within the train of purgatory, are from the Titanic and have such a great little arc. The man who risks life and limb for these children entrusted to him, faced with the reality that separation may be worse than death, and committing to stay with them in the icy waters. The girl, who delivers our central ideal and folklore outlook in the tale of the scorpion.  The scorpion laments his choice to flee from a weasel and die alone in a well. With the idea, ‘My death will be useless and I will be alone’ on its mind, the scorpion wishes that in the next life his body be used for ‘true happiness in the world.’ An outlook of sacrifice, wrapped in a wish to exist fully. Its a nice central point to the film.  The humans leave towards heaven, and Gio tries to comfort his friend. For most of the story, Campanella has been the slightly more mature and effective of the two. Watching his quiet shadow glide alone the story felt saddening at times, but this moment was such a pay off.  Gio’s affection for his friend is clear, and a great connection is held strong. Unlike Campanella though, Gio’s ticket is a special ticket that would let you enter ‘true heaven’ or any other stop along the ride. Campanella is not so lucky.  The film ends on a positive note, but it delivers a slow and methodical sadness throughout. Its almost exhausting, but the ending shows us why we took the journey we did. A glorious and tear jerking spiritual quest should always be this difficult. So Long, Space Cowboy.    Final Thoughts  I still prefer director Sugii‘s other work The Tale of Genji, but this film turned out to be really interesting. It was hard to even get into watching, with cat people and famously slow pacing, but I’m glad I did. A good film done in an odd way with solid goals, always fun to find another to add in the collection."

flicks,3dgbf0,Ursaguy,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:01 2015 UTC,":)  To actually answer your question, Blade Runner is one to re-try. I love sci fi of any sort (good to see you do to!) Although I read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep first, which is why I think I liked it more. I mostly projected what I wanted to get outta the movie the first watch through (the book is different) but the second time I just really liked it. Funny- I consider the movie to be Hard Sci-Fi but none of Philip K Dicks books are really ""hard"" sci-fi. (Also, he's my  second favorite author as a little side note)  Calling Ferris Buller morally repugnant... huh. I mean its just a fun 80's movie, but if the nostalgia ain't there, then there is no point in watching. For example, I can't even read about Fallingwater without thinking  of the movie. I watched it a lot as a kid.  Totally agree with you on Snowpiercer (I think it lacked the ending it deserved) and Pulp Fiction (bleh)"
flicks,3dgbf0,BrainSlurper,3,Thu Jul 16 04:15:42 2015 UTC,I would say Nightcrawler and Gone Girl (which I loved) and Pulp Fiction (which I also thought was overrated). I think it's useless for you to watch something like Snowpiercer or Interstellar again-They're so divisive that a second watch probably won't change your mind (coming from somebody who loved Snowpiercer and is pretty much in the middle on Interstellar).
flicks,3dgbf0,BogusSoup,3,Thu Jul 16 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"I am going purely off of what would get better on a second viewing if you didn't like it at first, not what I thought was the best on the list. If you managed to find gone girl boring, it certainly isn't going to become more entertaining. With that in mind, try Interstellar, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Blade Runner again."
flicks,3dgbf0,Dark1000,3,Thu Jul 16 05:17:03 2015 UTC,"I personally really like Nightcrawler, Snowpiercer, Blade Runner, and WOWS from a thematic standpoint. I'd recommend going back to the first two and trying not to get too focused on plot. Blade Runner is pretty slow, it might just be up to preference. WOWS is a little more difficult. I think the ending is supposed to be frustrating, and it's effective at it (at least for me). It's showing how things are, not how we'd like them to be, and I think it shows it well with the FBI agent on his uncomfortable subway ride home and Belfort spreading his poison to eager, ambitious young people just like he was.   I find Pulp Fiction very entertaining, but that's kind of a matter of taste.   But really you should watch anything you're conflicted or curious about. Maybe watch other stuff by the same directors and come back to them, as someone else recommended. The three Fincher movies you mentioned aren't bad but my personal favorites are Seven (or Se7en) and Zodiac."
flicks,3dgbf0,200balloons,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say they all deserve another shot, especially those that you mostly enjoyed. If you really hated any them, put those aside. Maybe you'll come back to them in a couple of years, maybe not. It's not that big a deal. There's no requirement that you like any movie, no matter how popular or acclaimed.  What I would do is think about what I liked about each movie (as all of them have positives or negatives). Then, instead of just re-watching the movies right away, first try a different film from the same director (Jackie Brown instead of Pulp Fiction for example). That film could give you more insight into the positive and negative qualities you found in the original. Perhaps read some reviews or analysis if you find that to be interesting and helpful. Then return to the original film.  That can give you a new perspective for the film in question. It doesn't mean you'll like the movies any more than before, but when you come at them from a different angle, there's at least a better chance that your opinion will be different.  If I had to highlight a couple that are especially worth revisiting, I'd say Pulp Fiction and The Social Network are the best of the bunch, but all of them have some value (except maybe Stardust and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, sorry)."
flicks,3dgbf0,augiemarched,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:11 2015 UTC,"My two cents:   Pulp Fiction - I'm not much of a fan, either; the last two times I've watched it I just felt empty, no connection to the characters or story.  Tons of style & confidence in the movie, but no resonance with me.  Leave it alone. Interstellar - I haven't seen it. Nightcrawler - A local new station treating graphic footage of accidents, murders, etc. is a little bit of a stretch, but it didn't distract me.  I took it as more of a dramatic metaphor for distasteful stories in a cynical media world that feeds off of negativity.  Local news puts a premium on stories about horrible things & crime, people pay more attention than ""good"" news.  I think this movie is worth another shot, it's creepy & wonderfully cynical. The Wolf of Wall Street - I haven't seen this either, & am not planning on it.  Everything I've read suggests it's a circus indirectly celebrating excess & a white-collar scumbag.  DiCaprio & Scorsese found this guy ""interesting"", so they immortalized him & fed his ego.  Feh. Stardust - Haven't seen it. Snowpiercer - I'd rewatch this at some point, although I didn't like it during first viewing.  It's got a lot of things going on & an interesting look to it.  Another I'd suggest for your re-examination (but not as much as Nightcrawler). Ferris Bueller's Day Off - Somebody in this sub wrote a scathing paragraph or two about how loathsome Ferris Bueller is (maybe it was you?), & I chuckled at it mostly because I couldn't disagree with it.  Still, I love this movie's spirit & snark, but maybe skip this one too, if your initial reaction was that strong I don't think there's anything that could convince you could embrace Ferris & his antics. Blade Runner - I've tried this movie a few times myself, & it doesn't click with me.  Looks great, thick potent atmosphere, but I also find it dull. Fincher's last 3 movies: Gone Girl was the most engaging for me, I'd suggest that one the most.  The Social Network is a hell of a lot of skill & talent to tell the story of an unlikeable shitheel who made billions of dollars making an updated MySpace. It's unfortunate that of all fascinating entrepreneurs Zuckerberg got the deluxe treatment, but it's such a slick movie.  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one I'll eventually re-watch, I'd seen it shortly after watching the original, which felt like a Nancy Drew Mystery, so Fincher's dark visual touch couldn't dispel that for me.   Final suggestion: Nightcrawler"

Agree with you on Stardust.  Pulp Fiction deserves a second chance, I hated it the first time as well, and like you kind of forced myself for watching the second time; and I don't regret that decision."
flicks,3dgbf0,Timme186,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:23:35 2015 UTC,The only one I think you might change your mind on is pulp fiction. Go in thinking of it as a kind of comedy.  Social network might possibly be worth another chance.
flicks,3dgbf0,GoddammitCricket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:41:35 2015 UTC,I would recommend Pulp Fiction And Ferris Bueller. Pulp Fiction definitely might require a second viewing and realize Ferris Buller isn't about the moral decision of skipping school it's about the fun they're having.

Go in with the expectations that you don't like the film, but that you're willing to give it another shot. There's a good chance you'll still dislike the films, and maybe even hate them more after more viewings."
