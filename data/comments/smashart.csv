smashart,3dvyyi,mothernaturer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:32 2015 UTC,Can someone identify what makes her look so horrific? i see the dodgy pupil positioning but what else??
smashart,3dvyyi,redjaypeg,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"mothernaturer,  I have some critiques for you if you don't mind.  before i start, I am in no way am trying to make fun of your art, just trying to give pointers on how to improve yourself.  let's begin.  when drawing a woman's face, make sure to keep your angles smooth.  the outline of the face should have nice curves to it (think of the letter S).  a man's face would have a more angular look to it (think of the letter Z).  the chin is also an important part.  a narrow chin also makes the face look slimmer, so try to go for a V but with a rounded out bottom.  one of my favorite tricks to do is to flip the image from side to side.  what this does is it shows any imperfections you might have glossed over.  simply adjust any mistakes and flip it back to it's original form.  lastly, PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE.  you can only get better the more you draw.  i hope you don't mind, but i altered your original drawing with these tips in mind.  i've been drawing for as long as i can remember so take it from someone who's been where you are. i hope you don't feel discouraged and continue to grow as an artist.  you are still more talented than most people i know. it just takes time to get better."
smashart,3dvyyi,redjaypeg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"Oooh!!! i really like the flip image idea!!! thank you so much for that edit and all your advice, really helped!!"

The reason I think this is because the image you're tracing over pokes through on occasion.  I'm not sure what program you're using, but based on that it sounds like it doesn't have a layer feature. You should check out GIMP. It's free photo manipulation/drawing software that will allow you some more control over things like that. You can take the original image, make it a transparent overlay, then do your work. There's also lots of other ways of doing this too.  Your choices on what details to include and what not to include are pretty spot on, and that's the hardest part of making something minimalist. Legitimately trying to help out here!"

smashart,3a8hhp,-Alecat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:32:36 2015 UTC,"The legs and body had to be ""leather hard"" to stick them together. I basically marked where the legs would go - meaning the place it'll look best whilst supporting the body - then I flipped it over and then placed the legs. I let it dry before putting it on its feet.  It's not that delicate actually. Just don't bump it into stuff, and the legs would be fine.  On a side not I actually messed up and forgot to add the circle around his legs as well. Also the glaze (glass paint) is very good on the shoes."

smashart,38tet9,MrKimimaru,4,Sat Jun 6 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"As far as technique goes, it looks like you drew in lines and then and used paint-bucket tool to fill in the spaces. This really isn't the way to go when it comes to digital painting. You have to take advantage of layers. By painting the line art on one layer and the colors on a layer underneath the line art, you can achieve smoothness between lines without any white spots showing.  As far as the anatomy, well, let me just say that people are very difficult to draw. It takes lots and lots of practice to draw something that accurately represents a well-proportioned human. So, it's not uncommon for beginners to draw humans that don't look right. We've all been there.  The only thing I can say to you right now is to not try and draw for results yet. And certainly don't promote your art by trying to sell t-shirts or anything like that yet, or else you'll just end up very sad and disappointed. You're at a beginner phase right now, and beginners don't usually have anything to present. The same goes for Smash Bros: No one wants to watch two beginners fight in a match because they haven't learned the basics (tech skill, matchups, combos, reading their opponent). The same goes for art: you have to get the basics down (perspective, anatomy, color, lighting, composition, design) before you can produce any good results. Just as you have to put in long hours of practice over a long period of time to become good at Smash, you have to do it for art as well. It is a skill, it has to be learned, and absolutely anyone can learn it.  With all of that said, if you really want to get good at digital painting, start here: http://www.ctrlpaint.com/library/ This website tremendously helped me to get started."
smashart,38tet9,me_is_kiki,2,Sun Jun 7 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right about coloring. It's always been an issue for me, especially digitally. Again there was some limits with only being able to use 10 colors because of teespring, but it's something I need to work on regardless. I'm still learning to use layers effectively.  Now anatomy is not normally an issue for me, but that being said my normal style is very cartoony so a lot of the proportions are a stylistic thing. Anything in this drawing you'd specifically recommend working on?  Ultimately I think a lot of the problem was the translation from paper to digital. I truly don't mean to sound overconfident but I honestly wouldn't consider myself a beginner artist. I've been drawing for many years at what I consider above a beginner level. Actually the reason for the shirt is because the guy who runs the twitter account ""SuperSmashShirts"" told me he liked my art and asked me if I would design some things for them. You're probably right that I'm not ready for that, though.  Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely use it. Again don't mean to seem like I'm blowing off your advice because I'm not. I just think the problem is less with the basics of art in general and more with translating them into digital art. That site will help tons with that. Thank you!"

smashart,38tet9,D0ctrpepper3,6,Sun Jun 7 02:47:51 2015 UTC,I've always wanted to wear a picture depicting the homeless man who lives down the block from me doing Marth cosplay!
smashart,38tet9,D0ctrpepper3,6,Sun Jun 7 03:57:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful advice
smashart,38tet9,fxuxk,2,Sun Jun 7 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm about 95% sure your response to /u/Meno_Self was supposed to be sarcastic, but I can't quite say for sure.   You may not realize it, but you can gather a lot of helpful information from someone saying your drawing looks like a homeless man  Marth is a character that pours elegance from every inch of his body. Look at his face and hair in your drawing. The facial features look sunken, and his hair is ruffled. Drawn correctly, Marth looks like a fantasy/anime type character with a very smooth face, smooth hair, feminine eyes, a small nose, and a weak jawline. Notice that Marth's skin is smooth across his whole body, not just the face, so his arms and neck shouldn't have any weird wrinkles on them  Next, look at Marth's clothing. In your drawing, the wrinkles don't quite look right. It's hard to say exactly what I mean briefly, but his cape and shirt should look fluid and only fold where clothes naturally fold, whereas your drawing's clothing doesn't fold right, which helps to give it the ""Homeless man"" look. Try to find a tutorial explaining clothing physics in depth.  Finally, your Marth is slouching and should stand more upright. If you do it right, he can stand somewhat relaxed, but a more formal pose would better suit Marth.  If work on these issues along with issues mentioned by others in this thread, I'm sure your next drawing will be a million times better. :)"
smashart,38tet9,TotallyNotDumb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"Wow that's... Super helpful. Thanks for being so specific. I understand what you mean by being able to gather a lot from his comment, but yours is the difference between an incredibly useful critique versus just being a jerk. Probably my biggest pet peeve is the way some people find it so easy to trash other people who worked hard on a piece of art.  All of your advice makes sense. It seems my biggest downfall was just unpopular design choices, but after all of the useful advice I actually plan on fixing it (or more likely just starting over). And he will be much prettier."
smashart,38tet9,TotallyNotDumb,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:59:14 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help :)  Anyway, while I agree he was ""just being a jerk,"" his comment helped give me an idea of what to criticize. When someone looks at your artwork and says ""that looks like <insert something negative here>,"" try to figure out what they mean. If they say a male character looks like a body builder when he shouldn't, they are probably saying his muscles are too big. If they say a female character looks like a man when she shouldn't, they are saying she has overly masculine features, etc.  And now, the important part: Your mindset in the face of criticism and ridicule.  Unless your artwork is really good, people are gonna trash it. They are not trashing you as a person, just your piece. If they say your character looks like a homeless man, at least you can take something away for constructive use... but it still stings a little bit. Even when people write legitimate constructive criticism, it can be demoralizing. Try to be positive minded. This doesn't mean you should ignore criticism, just that you shouldn't let comments about your work demoralize you."

smashart,37ly6d,OMGitsDSypl,3,Thu May 28 17:34:30 2015 UTC,Appreciate you giving the viewers a heads-up! :D
smashart,37kyt2,Blues_OVO,3,Thu May 28 11:42:28 2015 UTC,I really like your style. Keep it up.

smashart,37f7r7,Savy_eh,2,Wed May 27 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"/r/smashbros is currently looking for a new Snoo, as of yesterday at least. You should totally submit this there!  EDIT: looks like you already did, never mind. Cool stuff!"

smashart,3740ke,plooper14,20,Sun May 24 17:51:49 2015 UTC,mordecai and rigby fit so perfectly as fox and falco
smashart,3740ke,legonro,9,Sun May 24 18:28:06 2015 UTC,You know who else fits perfectly as fox and falco?
smashart,3740ke,Ninjuhz,9,Sun May 24 18:52:58 2015 UTC,MY MOM!
smashart,3740ke,Blackmamba42,13,Mon May 25 00:25:25 2015 UTC,Mac as Little Mac...  So good.
smashart,3740ke,SpahsgonnaSpah,9,Mon May 25 00:19:37 2015 UTC,Flapjack as Shulk  Brilliant

smashart,3740ke,xezav,6,Sun May 24 20:54:39 2015 UTC,Greg from Over the Garden Wall. It was a mini series that was on last year.
smashart,3740ke,OMGitsDSypl,3,Sun May 24 21:47:58 2015 UTC,That Samurai Marth is awesome!
smashart,3740ke,SpahsgonnaSpah,2,Mon May 25 01:29:47 2015 UTC,"I wonder who Garnet (Steven Universe) or Dexter (Dexter's Laboratory) would be.  Also, holy shit Little Mac, yes XD!! A lot of these are just so perfect <3!"
smashart,3740ke,MrLaughter,1 point,Mon May 25 03:36:11 2015 UTC,"Dexter would be Bowser Jr, and from what I've seen of Steven Universe, Garnet would be Ganondorf."
smashart,3740ke,Lord_Retardus,1 point,Mon May 25 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"Garnet would be little Mac, gloves and whatnot."
smashart,3740ke,yoyoyoyoyoman,2,Thu May 28 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"Flapjack as shulk is great, but I find myself wondering if his appearance doesn't suit Lucas more...  Regardless, this is pretty cool. You've got a huge chunk of characters from a bunch of different CN works here."
smashart,3740ke,idklikeseriouslyidk,1 point,Mon May 25 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Flapjack was Toon Link in my last one, but I wanted to switch things up a little."
smashart,3740ke,SpahsgonnaSpah,2,Mon May 25 15:17:28 2015 UTC,Eddy as Wario is the most fitting thing I've ever seen

smashart,3740ke,Tris_,1 point,Mon May 25 03:39:59 2015 UTC,Upgrade from Ben 10 would be a funny Mr. Game and Watch.
smashart,3740ke,bryceland23,1 point,Mon May 25 12:28:14 2015 UTC,I didn't include every character. I'd like to make a third one at some point with all of the characters in it.
smashart,3740ke,ImaMew,1 point,Mon May 25 15:19:50 2015 UTC,very impressive!

smashart,36z05f,-Alecat,3,Sat May 23 08:59:21 2015 UTC,"Nice to see this one completed, it looks awesome!"
smashart,36z05f,PKPenguin,2,Mon May 25 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm very pleased with how it came out, but I hoped it was going to be great for the background alone. I post WIPs to document a painting just in case I ruin it..."
smashart,36yhrr,bryceland23,3,Sat May 23 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Woah, hey, be fair! Meta Knight may have had the biggest drop in viability this side of Melee Kirby, but he's still not that bad."
smashart,36yhrr,Lord_Retardus,5,Sat May 23 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"I know, but Ganondorf loves giving him a hard time about it."
smashart,36yhrr,Mathsxyz,2,Sat May 23 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"yup, Meta Knight got nerfed to death but he's still a pretty viable Character imo."
smashart,36yhrr,SpahsgonnaSpah,2,Sat May 23 12:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his speed, string potential and gimping keeps him like this."
smashart,36yhrr,lifeoftheta,1 point,Sat May 23 16:30:12 2015 UTC,Brawl Puff and Falcon though
smashart,36wyjf,NanTheDark,4,Fri May 22 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"This is my first post in this subreddit. I first thought of sharing it in the main Smash Bros subreddit, but I figured it might fit better here.  It's nothing too fancy, just some ideas for Alternate Costumes. Enjoy!"
smashart,36wyjf,FlyingDiglett,3,Fri May 22 20:21:17 2015 UTC,I would totally rock the Mario Strikers alt!
smashart,36wyjf,bryceland23,2,Fri May 22 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love that design too. It would really fit in a battle context."
smashart,36wyjf,Bread_Boy,3,Sat May 23 00:34:24 2015 UTC,This is pretty neat. I wonder if we'll ever get alt. costumes for existing characters as DLC.
smashart,36wyjf,strontiummuffin,2,Sat May 23 04:42:53 2015 UTC,Really liking those 2 alts from smash 64.
smashart,36uebh,wallflyers,2,Fri May 22 05:18:17 2015 UTC,The cap and dorf being bros maybe doing falcon and warlock punches.
smashart,36uebh,WeeSmuff,5,Fri May 22 10:00:53 2015 UTC,Someone order 2 bros fist bumping in space?   Kind of ignored the falcon/warlock punch part.... this is just the image that came to my mind
smashart,36uebh,spannbowser,1 point,Fri May 22 21:30:15 2015 UTC,That's awesome dude thanks!
smashart,36uebh,WeeSmuff,2,Sat May 23 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"I'm working on something and I wanted to encourage someone to try something similar.  Basically, you redraw a screenshot from SSB4 any way you want to, any style you want to. I'd encourage you not to trace the screenshot, but stuff like placement/poses could be identical. I got the idea from this post. Either pick a screenshot from smashbros.com, from some other website, or even one of your own screenshots. It would be a fun project, I think."
smashart,36uebh,OMGitsDSypl,2,Fri May 22 11:03:56 2015 UTC,"Hm, I actually wanted to do this during the pre-launch PotD but I got scared of committing to daily drawings. Might have a shot at just a one-off though!"
