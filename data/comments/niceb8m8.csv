niceb8m8,3cc37o,NanoPi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:57:40 2015 UTC,in this case they're trying to trick you into believing you are on the twitch website and not logged in when you're really visiting a different website on a different domain name.  attempting to log in means you're giving your twitch username and password to a different website pretending to be twitch. whoever is running that website can then add your twitch account to their spam bot or do anything they want to your twitch account.
niceb8m8,3cc37o,jozzarozzer,3,Wed Jul 8 15:32:53 2015 UTC,Also people usually have the same username/password for multiple things. So they just log into your steam account with your twitch info.

niceb8m8,37l7uk,maskdmann,2,Fri May 29 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"It is.  Some time ago, Valve added a new security measure - whenever you do a trade that takes items away from your account, you get a verification message on your e-mail. There, you have to click a confirmation button, so forwarding that message to him allows him to conduct the trade on his own, although I'm sure it's impossible to do without your account's cookies. I'm too lazy to check this out."

niceb8m8,30xb0t,yanir3,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Ah good to know.  But in theory some servers do have extra files such as .mp3   And maybe you can add an exe or something like that. But idk for sure, I've never owned a server nor programmed viruses"
niceb8m8,30xb0t,Fabi_S,4,Tue Mar 31 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"In theory sure but your client never just 'runs' a file like .mp3, the game has things like an audio system who does that. If the game just executed files your default media player would pop up whenever the game wanted to play a sound.   Just like you can't place a virus inside a picture because it's being read by a picture display program (you could actually find a hole in the reading program and exploit that but that's a whole other level)."
niceb8m8,30xb0t,yanir3,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"Just like you can't place a virus inside a picture because it's being read by a picture display program (you could actually find a hole in the reading program and exploit that but that's a whole other level).     I'm not sure I would completely agree with this statement. You can place executable code (e.g. a virus) in a file that is never directly executed like a JPG, but its ability to execute is dependent on you tricking the program that reads it into executing it, say by overflowing a buffer and causing a portion of the file to be read into memory that is executed. Windows' handling of JPG files has been exploited multiple times.    In the same vein, someone could theoretically find a flaw in the way CS:GO handles a certain type of file and exploit it to execute arbitrary code. Valve would most certainly patch that hastily as they did with the recently discovered Steam profile XSS vulnerability, but I definitely wouldn't recommend joining server addresses that random people add you to tell you, even if there's a 99.999% chance that it's just going to be a lame attempt to get you to manually download and execute malicious software from a website."

The victim buys it to trade for a ""good"" offer, but the scammer has you r money now, so he can just delete you.  A very popular version includes different qualities of Dota 2 items - Autographed, for example, only requires a rune to be socketed into the item, it gives like a billion combinations that are not on the market (which means you can put it up for any price you want), but they're worth nothing as they're not exclusive.

niceb8m8,2t4du9,helpmymotherboard,7,Wed Jan 21 07:34:20 2015 UTC,The scammer has an alternative account listed selling the emoticon or wallpaper for a really high price because it's the only one on the market. The victim buys it thinking they'll trade it for the person's inventory at a lesser cost than buying the items outright. Once the victim purchases the expensive wallpaper or emoticon they block the victim and keep the money from the sale.
niceb8m8,2t4du9,Strychnine357,2,Wed Jan 21 11:43:19 2015 UTC,Thanks dude.

niceb8m8,2r7hm2,Furreon,11,Sat Jan 3 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"So lets make it clear. Let's say my Steam Name is Wolf.   I'm trading with Tiger that wants my knife. He asks me to trade with a friend of mine (whom i trust), named Cat. He says he wants to check if the knife does not disapear after the trade.  I trade the knife with Cat for nothing and ask Tiger if it's alright. Suddenly, he dc'd.   Cat gets a message from a steam account that is named Wolf and has the same picture as i do. He then proceeds to give the knife back, since we agreed on that. But this isnt Wolf, it's Tiger who changed his information to look like me.  And that's how i lost 70 euros folks ! Don't try this at home."
niceb8m8,2r7hm2,masterofthecontinuum,1 point,Sun Jan 4 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"Because that ""friend"" of yours isn't your actual friend by the time you will be trading with him. A friend of the scammer will change his name and avatar to be similar to you real friend's and they will then pretend to be your friend and then the scammer's friend will end up with the item in the end. Never agree to these kind of set ups... They are all scams."

niceb8m8,2qzoq8,tacticalshovel,3,Thu Jan 1 10:14:03 2015 UTC,"The idea behind the scam is that the scammer will try to get you to part ways with your knife by getting you to trade it over to a person on your friends list that you trust. Then they would hop onto an alternate account and make their profile look exactly like yours, profile picture and all. If you weren't verbally communicating with your friend they might be tricked into trading the knife to someone who they think is you, but is actually the scammer.  Mind you this became alot more difficult to pull off since Steam implemented the information about the person you're trading with in the trade window."

niceb8m8,2qxr2r,paulgt,3,Wed Dec 31 19:30:00 2014 UTC,There are ways to programmatically give 'unique' names through the use of pseudorandom numbers to randomly choose and concatenate adjectives and nouns.

The number in parenthesis indicates that this is the 33rd 'person' in my list of friends/blocked people with the same name.  For this reason when people do the ""i need you to trade this item to a trusted friend"" and they invite a person who is impersonating the friend you pick, they always have to add a period or something to their name to avoid being given away by the parentheses. To avoid being fooled by this you should always give a persistent nickname to all of your friends through the steam client. Furthermore, steam warns you if the person you are trading with is not on your friends list."
