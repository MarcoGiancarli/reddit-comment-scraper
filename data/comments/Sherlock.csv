Sherlock,3e27cd,SquireAttendMe,55,Tue Jul 21 11:40:12 2015 UTC,"Magnussen is, in my mind, like Owlman in the Batman comics; a rival to Sherlock in a very direct way, doing a similar thing for personal gain and selfish way.  Moriarty, then, is like the Joker; his strength comes partly through his unpredictability."
Sherlock,3e27cd,hardgeeklife,30,Tue Jul 21 13:29:30 2015 UTC,The way you described Magnussen is exactly how Moriarty is in the actual canon. Much more of a criminal counterpart than an anarchist like in Sherlock.
Sherlock,3e27cd,RunHomeJack,5,Tue Jul 21 14:01:04 2015 UTC,fair point! They definitely went in a different direction in the modern incarnation.
Sherlock,3e27cd,hardgeeklife,8,Tue Jul 21 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"The show definitely portrays Moriarty like someone who feeds out of chaos. Which does give him a dark comedic angle at times.   The book version of Moriarty though is different.. he's a cold, calculating and meticulous planner who protects nearly all of the criminals of England in exchange for their obedience and a share in their profits.   So in simple terms he's more of a combination of Magnussen and show Moriarty."
Sherlock,3e27cd,pa_one,15,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"They're scary in different way. Magnussen is very intimidating, he's scary because of the sheer power he holds over people, the power he has to control people and bend them to his will. He's scary because of what he can make you do.   Moriarty is only really scary because of what he could do. He's unpredictable, and seems to love being the bad guy. He doesn't have the same power over you effect as Magnussen has, he isn't as intimidating, but you really don't want him on your case."
Sherlock,3e27cd,timmystwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:33 2015 UTC,You mean that Moriarty is dangerous because he basically is a mad lunatic?
Sherlock,3e27cd,timmystwin,6,Tue Jul 21 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's a lunatic. He knows what he's doing, and is bloody good at it. It's the fact he loves being evil, and is more than capable of succeeding, that is scary. You don't know what manner of crime he's going to do, but he'll like it and it will be done professionally."
Sherlock,3e27cd,torch3457,8,Tue Jul 21 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think that was the point in series 3. They wanted to write Magnussen in a way that portrayed him as intimidating as he knew the pressure point on everyone.   I do hope that Moriarty doesn't become a comedy character as we don't need another show that's all about the comedy instead of the actual show. This is a problem with Moffat he tries to make everything into a comedy when it doesn't need to be. I prefer it when he just does the smart writing.   Moffat is a great comedian, but I wish he'd save his comedy for a comedy show like Coupling. Hopefully, if/when Moriarty comes back in series 4 we'll see him as a threat to Sherlock, but that's up to the writers."
Sherlock,3e27cd,pixie_led,7,Tue Jul 21 12:38:53 2015 UTC,I'm still very scared of Moriarty. I wouldn't turn my back on him for a second.
Sherlock,3e27cd,benzimo,4,Tue Jul 21 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Still, Sherlock has shown himself to be an at least equal counterpart to Moriarty.  The only way he could beat Magnussen was a bullet, which shows to me that Magnussen was stronger than Sherlock."
Sherlock,3e27cd,sparta_interiors,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but like that was a really stupid move on Magnussen's part. He doesn't seem to understand that even if you can blackmail people into your control, there's still a few who are desperate enough that they'll want to shoot you regardless of the consequences (Mary & Sherlock). He didn't even have his men frisk them for guns. Huge blind spot."
Sherlock,3e27cd,shitsfuckedupalot,4,Tue Jul 21 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"I really hope we get a reference to magnussen from moriarty in the new series. Maybe he was working for moriarty, maybe he had something on him too.  Maybe the woman will come back, she was very similar to magnussen, in that she had power over people with information."

Sherlock,3dzg1w,rocker2014,12,Mon Jul 20 20:05:34 2015 UTC,Netflix UK one only has first 2 seasons....
Sherlock,3dzg1w,rocker2014,29,Mon Jul 20 21:03:12 2015 UTC,Now that is incredibly odd. Why would US have a British series before the UK?
Sherlock,3dzg1w,L8141,27,Mon Jul 20 21:13:01 2015 UTC,The BBC want people from the UK to use iPlayer or other things they own so they keep it off our Netflix. But they also want to increase interest in other countries so they release it on US Netflix
Sherlock,3dzg1w,fandangoferret,3,Mon Jul 20 21:15:52 2015 UTC,They want people in the UK to buy the 3rd series box set I would have thought.
Sherlock,3dzg1w,tanketom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:39 2015 UTC,Digital and physical rights are two quite different worlds. The iPlayer is most likely the key to this.

Sherlock,3dy6lx,FluffandNutella,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:57 2015 UTC,Sorry for the potato video I found on youtube. My question is this - why did Derren Brown need to wind back John's watch a few minutes? I can't seem to figure out a reasoning behind this?  Any thoughts?
Sherlock,3dy6lx,tayatagi,3,Mon Jul 20 14:30:37 2015 UTC,"So that when John woke up several minutes later, he would think no time has passed."
Sherlock,3dy6lx,luckymagnet,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"I know it was just a theory play back - but I couldn't figure out why the time reference would be so important? Maybe if it took a long time to do the body switching or something? It seemed like I was missing something and normally in Sherlock when I feel like I'm missing something, I am!"
Sherlock,3dy6lx,trevdordurden,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"Agree with u/tayatagi. Plus it gives the team enough time to switch bodies, deflate the safety bag (bed/mattress), set up the scene for John to see."
Sherlock,3dy6lx,luckymagnet,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:26 2015 UTC,But then John would notice that his watch was off compared to other clocks
Sherlock,3dy6lx,bluffingdog,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"True. But with the trauma of seeing his best friend jump off a building, I doubt that John will notice the time and compare with other clocks."
Sherlock,3dy6lx,joelybowlyrocknrolly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:59 2015 UTC,I think he might have because most Londoners set their watches to Big Ben
Sherlock,3dy6lx,joelybowlyrocknrolly,3,Tue Jul 21 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"u/luckymagnet is right and also, it might be a little while before he notices and when he does it would be more difficult to make the connection to the event. He would probably think he forgot to wind it before."
Sherlock,3dy6lx,luckymagnet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:06 2015 UTC,The weird part to me is that I didn't see why it would matter what time the watch was because it wasn't like he had just looked at it and made a connection to the time right when he jumped to even notice how long he has been out cold.
Sherlock,3dv23v,nellabella27,3,Sun Jul 19 19:24:14 2015 UTC,SOURCE   There are more little clips at the source and this is my favorite :D
Sherlock,3duf81,Rekhyt2853,50,Sun Jul 19 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea to tag spoilers and the episode number. The purpose of this is to not discourage new viewers and discussion with redditors who have just discovered it. It's a nice thing to do, and it helps prevent the subreddit for degenerating into something elitist that reacts negatively to anyone who isn't already fully immersed and familiar with everything Sherlock related."
Sherlock,3duf81,Sabnitron,16,Sun Jul 19 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Never. There will always be someone who hasn't seen it yet.  I was just spoiled on the Breaking Bad finale on Mythbusters last night. Have been planning to check out that show some time, but haven't had the chance yet."
Sherlock,3duf81,morphinapg,3,Sun Jul 19 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"That sucks but its also acceptable at this point to assume if you were going to watch it, you have.    You wouldn't be mad about the sixth sense being spoiled in an episode of scrubs would you?"
Sherlock,3duf81,sargeantbob,2,Mon Jul 20 08:50:05 2015 UTC,"There will always be people who haven't gotten a chance to watch something, for plenty of valid reasons. There's no reason they deserve to have that experience ruined for them."
Sherlock,3duf81,morphinapg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:57 2015 UTC,Yea but the internet does a great job of providing spoiler alerts for a long time.  At some point the users seem to just forget and I think its fine.  I'm not arguing we should stop doing it though.  Just stating some almost useless shit at this point.  Reddit should probably just ignore me...
Sherlock,3duf81,sargeantbob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fine. I think obviously the longer you wait the more you risk spoilers, but sometimes you don't always have the opportunity to watch things when you want to. If I could have I would have watched Breaking Bad shortly after it ended, but I haven't really had the chance to do so yet. Been busy with other shows I had already started and others I had already planned to watch before hearing of breaking bad.   Anyway, my point  was that there will always be people who haven't seen something, for whatever reason, and I think those people deserve to have the same viewing experience as those who saw it first."
Sherlock,3duf81,morphinapg,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:19 2015 UTC,Good point.  I'll do my best to not spoil!   This man is right.  Keep spoiler alert forever
Sherlock,3duf81,sargeantbob,13,Mon Jul 20 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"See, I feel like after a certain amount of time you lose your rights to see it without spoilers.   You haven't had a chance to watch the show in almost two full years? There's only 62 episodes, if you had watched one a night you'd be done in 2 months. I understand you can't guarantee you can watch one every single night but since the air date of the last episode you've had almost 730 days."
Sherlock,3duf81,Zenrot,11,Mon Jul 20 00:42:39 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure it's acceptable to say there's a statute of limitations on spoilers, 2 years is hardly acceptable. Hell, people still think you're a dick if you ruin Harry Potter, Crying Game, or even Citizen Kane (at least if you do it on purpose). Sure, at some point you gotta say ""I spoiled Romeo and Juliet for you? I'm sorry it's a 500 year old play... deal with it"", but two years is hardly the same thing.  I think if you can discuss something without spoiling it you should. You can have a conversation about Harry Potter without revealing who gets killed and by whom. You can talk about Citizen Kane without revealing what Rosebud means. Crying Game... okay well the ""spoiler"" is probably what makes the film most interesting so that one's trickier.   I guess the point is, if you can have a conversation without spoiling something you should. And if you can't, and there are systems in place to prevent spoilers for those who don't want things spoiled why wouldn't you use it?   Then again, look at Star Wars. There's a plot twist that is a total part of the popular culture, and it still works as a film. But man, imagine what it would be like to not have that twist spoiled.   Why would you want to take that away from someone?"
Sherlock,3duf81,bort_sampson,7,Mon Jul 20 02:33:41 2015 UTC,Honestly the way I see it? Don't go on a sub without catching up. Especially one like Sherlock where the seasons are so short with so little episodes. Makes no sense browsing when you can just do it after you watch the show which would take you like 2 weeks max.  Never really got why people browse discussions when they haven't caught up. You're always going to be spoiled one way or another. Just see if there's an active show sub and then get excited you can discuss after you're done.
Sherlock,3duf81,TheJoshider10,2,Mon Jul 20 08:37:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly!!!!  If I missed a new episode of a show, I avoid every place on the Internet where it might be discussed until I saw it.  And if I start a new show I don't read discussions until I'm up to date, I won't be able to partake anyway, and it's not like I won't be able to read these discussions in the future, when I'm at a point where I actually understand what everyone is talking about. Nor do I go to a book discussion club before I read the book and expect everyone to avoid major spoilers or just whisper them to each other."
Sherlock,3duf81,Baking-Bad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:17:12 2015 UTC,"Really? I mean, I suppose you could make the argument ""don't subscribe to the show's subreddit until your caught up"" but saying you avoid any place on the internet where it might be discussed? So do you just not use the internet?  I've had pretty much every bit of Game of Thrones spoiled for me because I happen to use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and any number of other services. Not to mention articles that are written on blogs and even newspaper's sites. At this point I'm not even going to bother to watch the show, because I feel like I already know all the best moments, and the enjoyment will be ruined for me.  There was a time where if you spoiled something you were considered a jerk. If you revealed Darth Vader's true identity, or what really happened at the end of The Sixth Sense people would hate you. Now there's an expectation that everyone should be 100% up to date with every single piece of pop culture. I'm sorry, that's a ludicrous assumption."
Sherlock,3duf81,bort_sampson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know which sites you visit regularly, I just know avoiding spoilers works just fine for me. Now that you mention it, I realize that everyone will have a different experience, based on the media they consume.  For me it is pretty easy. I don't use social media like Facebook, twitter, instagramm and co, I just use reddit (which I wouldn't call a social media but that doesn't matter). I get my news from sites that focus only on politics and economy and have nothing to do with pop culure, sometimes I check sites who specialize on pop culture to find out about new shows but I avoid them when I am not up to date with a popular show , I check epguides for new episodes of the shows I watch, and youtube for my subscribed channels. And then there are many other sites that are specialized in one thing, like telling me when my bus/train is departing, or email service, or research portals, and other unentertaining stuff like that. So for me avoiding spoilers is pretty easy, I managed to let 2 seasons of Game of Thrones  pass, until I started watching without having anything spoiled( welll i saw somne pics on reddit, but without any context they made so little sense to me, that I just instantly forgot them) But that doesn't work for everyone of course.  But I think the most important thing here is: we are not talking about spoiling stuff on facebook, or in a newspaper, we are talking about spoilers in a subreddit which is specialized in one show. And I think such a subreddit is somewhat equal to a book discussion club. You go there to discuss the full thing and not to shush everyone else, because you just finished chapter one. If you aren't caught up, unsubscribe the subreddit until you have."
Sherlock,3duf81,Baking-Bad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"Some people have other things they need or want to do, but still would like to watch that show eventually. I don't go searching or join discussions of shows/books/games I'm not caught up on. If I do nearly everything in my power to avoid spoilers  (besides the obvious of watching it on time) I think my annoyance of people spoiling it is justified."
Sherlock,3duf81,ChernobylKrigare,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:07:14 2015 UTC,"See, I feel like after a certain amount of time you lose your rights to see it without spoilers.   There's never a ""right"". It's just that people should be considerate of the fact that some people won't have seen it. It's pretty easy to warn people that you're about to talk about something they might not have seen.    You haven't had a chance to watch the show in almost two full years? There's only 62 episodes, if you had watched one a night you'd be done in 2 months. I understand you can't guarantee you can watch one every single night but since the air date of the last episode you've had almost 730 days.   I watch over 80 currently airing shows. By the time I had started hearing people talk about Breaking Bad a lot, it was nearly over. I only watch old shows one at a time, in chronological order, and I already had plenty of other shows on the list. Non-current shows are lower priority to me so I don't even average one episode a day usually. Also, if there's a new streaming show, like Daredevil or Kimmy Schmidt for example, those take priority over the old shows as well."
Sherlock,3duf81,morphinapg,6,Mon Jul 20 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to warn people that you're about to talk about something they might not have seen.   Except if you were to do that regularly you have to spoiler warning essentially everything. I don't know you and what you have and haven't seen. John Watson is a guy in this show! He's a girl in Elementary!. Literally everything.    I watch over 80 currently airing shows. By the time I had started hearing people talk about Breaking Bad a lot, it was nearly over. I only watch old shows one at a time, in chronological order, and I already had plenty of other shows on the list. Non-current shows are lower priority to me so I don't even average one episode a day usually. Also, if there's a streaming show, like Daredevil or Kimmy Schmidt for example, those take priority over the old shows as well, since those don't air on a regular schedule either.   And thats fine, and your choice, but I think it's pretty insane to expect other people to not talk about things based on your schedule. I haven't seen Daredevil, and really don't give two shits about people talking about it because its been out long enough by now that I acknowledge I could've seen it by now.   I don't know that you've read Harry Potter, I don't know if you've ever played Mario 64, I don't know that you've seen Spartacus, and I'm not going to tiptoe around everything just in case, nobody should be expected to do that. You cannot possibly experience all of popular culture.  You haven't watched Breaking Bad yet, okay then when? In 2023 would you still get irritated when someone posts ""Walt makes drugs"" without blacking it out first? Whats the cutoff, because 2-3 years is a very long time."
Sherlock,3duf81,Zenrot,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"Except if you were to do that regularly you have to spoiler warning essentially everything. I don't know you and what you have and haven't seen.   I always do that. It's really not all that hard. And no, you don't need to use spoiler blocks for everything, just for the stuff that would have made the experience better if they hadn't known about it. For everything else, just make it clear in context what you're about to talk about. You don't even have to say ""spoilers"" or anything. Just say on Elementary, Watson is a girl. If someone doesn't want to know anything about Elementary, they will see that you're about to talk about something on Elementary and avoid the rest of your sentence.   And thats fine, and your choice, but I think it's pretty insane to expect other people to not talk about things based on your schedule.   Like I said, it's not an expectation. I just like to be understanding that there's always going to be someone who hasn't seen what I'm about to talk about, and I think it's only kind for others to do the same. I just know that plenty of people don't have the time to watch every single thing the moment it's released, or even within a short period after it's released. People have busy lives. People don't always know about every show/movie/game/etc. There are tons of valid reasons why someone wouldn't have seen something, and there's no reason they should be penalized for not being as up to date as everyone else. Like I said, it's fairly easy to discuss things without having to bring up key things that would hurt the experience for others. If discussion of those things are necessary, it's better if people warn others that they could potentially have the experience ruined if they kept reading.   And obviously, it's a matter of making fair assumptions. If you go into a discussion thread for an episode or a movie, obviously it's completely fair to assume people have seen it. If someone posts a thread asking ""what are your favorite twists"", you have to expect to be spoiled in those. If you go to a subreddit for a show or a movie, you should expect spoilers. If you go to read reviews, or watch trailers, you'll probably see some spoilers. Those are times where it's completely the person's fault if they spoil themselves. That's not what I'm talking about.   It's those times when a person gets a spoiler out of nowhere, and now can't enjoy something the way it was meant to be enjoyed. They didn't deserve that. They weren't asking for it. Yet now that thing is ruined for them. It doesn't even have to be a major spoiler, even small things can hurt the experience for others. There are kids these days who haven't seen Star Wars yet. It's not their fault they haven't had a chance to watch it, so why should it be completely fine to spoil that experience for them? It shouldn't. They should be able to have the same experience everyone else has had.   Oh and look, I talked about something without actually giving away the spoiler. How about that, it was easy and didn't hurt the discussion whatsoever.   You haven't watched Breaking Bad yet, okay then when? In 2023 would you still get irritated when someone posts ""Walt makes drugs"" without blacking it out first? Whats the cutoff, because 2-3 years is a very long time.   Like I said in my first comment, there is no cutoff. There are always going to be people that, for whatever reason, haven't been able to see something, and those people deserve to be able to have the same experience as everyone else who saw it day one."
Sherlock,3duf81,morphinapg,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"Same here! I was passing through the living room long enough to ask, ""What are you watching?"" Then the spoilers came. I tried to run but it was too late. Their voices followed me as I retreated upstairs to the safety of my room.  My mind kept repeating that scene over and over until I cried myself to sleep. I'm in therapy now. One day, I hope to escape the pain of the Breaking Bad spoilers. One day..."
Sherlock,3duf81,ChernobylKrigare,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"My $.02, but they STILL try to help keep people from spoiling the murder from Christie's ""The Mousetrap"". A quick tag to help out someone who is seeing it for the first time is really worth the second of extra work on our side of knowing the show, IMHO."
Sherlock,3duf81,SuitedUpLikeTen,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"I personally think people need to get over their fear of spoilers, and I don't mean just Sherlock fans, I mean the weird thing we obsess over as spoilers.   It's gonna leak through anyway so why bother? How badly harmed are you if you know the twist? Not all that badly; you can still enjoy the dialogue, the cinematography, the pacing even if you know some details of the plot.   But the other thing is, there are very few things that really really qualify as a spoiler. We frequently mark completely irrelevant information as a spoiler -- for example Sherlock chose to tie his scarf differently -- but the really big twists are the only things that really qualify as a spoiler, and, frankly, there aren't all that many out there in the mediaverse.   In short, I agree; it's time we got over spoilers and just discussed what we want to discuss without worry."

I don't know about you, but a lot of my friends are working two or three jobs, or are going to college while also working. That is a lot of time for some people.

There were so many things which just seemed wrong somehow, like they just didn't belong in the Sherlock universe they had so carefully crafted previously. OP has also picked up on some of those points, so at least I know it isn't just me.  However, I think 'it was all a dream' would be the final nail in the coffin for me. I'm already worried enough by this upcoming Victorian special. A gimmic too far? Maybe. Has Moffat jumped the shark? it wouldn't be the first time."

Sherlock,3dtm9w,HaveAMap,5,Sun Jul 19 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"The writers, Moffat and Gatiss, are longtime Sherlock Holmes fans and they've wanted to do this adaptation for years before it was a reality. So I would think they have strong ideas about what they want to do each season, as this is a project that they are very invested in. If season 3 seems to be interacting with fans, it's because the writers want to interact with fans (and in so doing refer to the decades of interaction between Sherlock Holmes adaptations and fans). This is a vanity project for them and they are going to do what they want with it. Of course some fans (such as yourself) will not be pleased. As far as the fans, the fanfic part of the fandom has exploded since season 3 aired. Why? Because season 3 was very encouraging that way. The show is leading the fans, not vice versa."

The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one's ability to learn useful things. Watson assesses Holmes' abilities:  Knowledge of Literature – nil. Knowledge of Philosophy – nil. Knowledge of Astronomy – nil. Knowledge of Politics – Feeble. Knowledge of Botany – Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. Knowledge of Geology – Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks, has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them. Knowledge of Chemistry – Profound. Knowledge of Anatomy – Accurate, but unsystematic. Knowledge of Sensational Literature – Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. Plays the violin well. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer and swordsman. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.

If I recall correctly, Sherlock says that in the event of an emergency, a mother looks to her child. He knew that Irene would look to her most prized possession, the black mail materials, if there was an emergency so he asked John to cause one. If you read Scandal in Bohemia, the short story on which the episode is based, Holmes and Watson discuss it prior to going to visit Irene. I believe Watson sets off some type of smoke bomb in the story."
Sherlock,3dn5io,jellicle88,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:21 2015 UTC,Yes. In the story John was let in on the plot. He was to raise the alarm of fire by shouting. Can't remember the episode as well as the story but I figured they discussed the plan at some point.

Sherlock,3dn5io,BeTheGuy2,3,Fri Jul 17 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Sherlock probably made his plan while he was still in the Buckingham Palace; to impress the equerry he says he need some equipment then asks for his lighter.   ""How"" he planned that beforehand is not that much complicated. There were enough information to assume Irene Adler was keeping pictures with her, so all he needed was a way to make her expose the exact location of the pictures and he decided to use fire (and maybe had dozen other backup plans if the building didn’t had any smoke alarm)  Also Sherlock stops taxi just after John asks what the plan is, so he most likely shared his plan after the fighting as mentioned before."

Do you think we can get his son, David?”  “He’s not an actor and no one will know who he is.”  “Perfect. We’ve already got BC’s parents and MF’s wife in this episode. Lets get JB’s son.

However, I do think that the actor who played Moran looks much more like Jeremy Brett than his biological son, and can see why you thought there was a relation.  Perhaps Jeremy had another son that we don't know about?  Maybe he wanted to be in Sherlock but didn't want to reveal his lineage?"

Sherlock,3dfl9k,Kariodude,34,Wed Jul 15 21:53:06 2015 UTC,Here's the timeline of what happened:   Sherlock survived the fall Fans everywhere came up with theories Moffat bragged about how brilliant the explanation is Moffat claims he's read several fan theories online and no one is right and everyone is missing something important. Moffat says all will be explained Nothing is ever explained
Sherlock,3dfl9k,hologramleia,6,Thu Jul 16 09:28:58 2015 UTC,I love you.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,NotAsClumsyOrRandom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:56 2015 UTC,And here's what really happened:   Moffat believes he's come up with a mystery no one will solve. Season 3 finale premieres. People correctly guess the solution within a few weeks. Moffat doesn't want to admit that people solved it.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,PotatoesMcLaughlin,16,Sun Jul 19 03:03:35 2015 UTC,Hagrid saved him with his flying motorcycle.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,magicbananas00,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:03:43 2015 UTC,Nah it was the doctor with the tardis or Iron Man.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,mansefson,8,Thu Jul 16 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"Moffat didn't think it worth it to explain how he survived, even after saying publicly it would be revealed, as is his MO."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,tqsun,4,Wed Jul 15 22:31:59 2015 UTC,"I think he's lying as well, I can't think of a reason why he would tell Anderson. They've always hated each other, and I think he'd owe the explanation to John or Lestrade or Mrs. Hudson more. I can't really think of another way at the moment though.  About Moriarty: I subscribe to the fan theory that the real mastermind is Kitty Riley. There's no way Moriarty survived that gun shot, even if it were a blank (blanks can be dangerous that close). Moriarty (Richard Brooks) was just a cover for Kitty and Sherlock (may have) missed all that. I can find the link describing why in detail if you wish."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,Hyperman360,11,Wed Jul 15 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"I can think of a reason he'd tell Anderson: he doesn't want to reveal it to anyone, but that's (as Holmes said himself in Season 1) the frailty of genius: it requires an audience. Holmes needs to tell someone, so he picks Anderson, who he knows will never believe the explanation.  Moriarty, I'm not sure, it's all very odd."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,dragongrrl56,3,Thu Jul 16 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"Moriarty's dead. There would have been an uproar if his body just disappeared off the roof. But Moriarty has a brother . . .   Or as people have said, that Moriarty was a front man. Although an awfully dedicated one to die for the cause that way. Not my favorite theory.  So many things are possible. And they might just not give us an explanation. Moffat also seems to like cat and mouse."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,Hyperman360,6,Thu Jul 16 14:51:32 2015 UTC,I'd feel a little cheated if someone else was actually the Moriarty mastermind.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,dragongrrl56,3,Thu Jul 16 17:03:45 2015 UTC,OMG me too. I love love love Andrew Scott.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,polybius2,2,Thu Jul 16 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm unclear on the public status of Jim's body.  Don't the fake theories contradict on whether or not Jim's body was found?  The fangirl has him running off with Sherlock, which suggests no one found his body, and Anderson does away with the body by disguising it as Sherlock.  But Sherlock's explanation doesn't account for the body vanishing, which suggests that the police found the body there."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,dragongrrl56,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:39:45 2015 UTC,Right.
Sherlock,3dfl9k,Sherlock_0fucksgiven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"I think that  Moriarty ""was"" the brain and he is dead but there is still someone who has agreed with him to play his recorded messages and make a fake comeback. Or Moriarty actually did go off the roof and blackmailed the... i dont know the word... people who he needed to escape."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,dragongrrl56,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think he lied to Anderson. Genius may need an audience, but he already had an audience (remember all those newspapers and tweets) and could tell them anything he wanted.   I have to say, I think he was ready to tell John the night he surprised him but John was too angry to let him. Then when John asked, Sherlock was back in cat and mouse mode."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,tqsun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, that would a very interesting read.  As for the first part, that is what I thought, and I'm thinking that maybe Moriarty works it out?"
Sherlock,3dfl9k,Ragadash7,3,Wed Jul 15 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"http://iodineoxygenuraniumafall.tumblr.com/post/42690699153 There are one or two rather subjective points, but the rest is intriguing.  I guess one part I failed to mention was that in the final episode of season 3, where Moriarty's face pops up everywhere, it's just a picture and a soundbite that is heavily edited. Seems a bit suspicious and very easy to do (just need his picture and do a soundbite yourself). If the mastermind was Kitty all along, she would have the resources to pull something off like this."
Sherlock,3dfl9k,torch3457,6,Thu Jul 16 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"I feel he tell Anderson the real story, and added a little cause for doubt at the end to drive Anderson angry as revenge. Also check out the audio commentary for this episode, I think Moffat explains it!"

Sherlock,3d9ogi,eeyore102,39,Tue Jul 14 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"I believe it was overconfidence. CAM believed that he had beaten Sherlock and there was nothing Sherlock could do about it. Also, Sherlock wasn't suppose to be a killer, so CAM underestimated him and ends up dead."
Sherlock,3d9ogi,Shadownumber45,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:37 2015 UTC,Notice how you call him CAM.
Sherlock,3d9ogi,harsh183,3,Wed Jul 15 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"I called him CAM because I was on mobile, forgot how to spell Magnussen and was too lazy to look up the spelling. :P  Also, that little mention of him in Sign of Three was genius!"
Sherlock,3d9ogi,Shadownumber45,36,Wed Jul 15 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that he thinks they're harmless. He peed in their living room fireplace and they didn't react, after all. He's used to people being cowed over because of all the leverage he has on them. I think it never occurred to him that they would pose any trouble."
Sherlock,3d9ogi,kibben,4,Tue Jul 14 16:56:26 2015 UTC,I think it is because he didn't perceive him as a threat anymore.
Sherlock,3d9ogi,TexasBobbi,3,Tue Jul 14 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"At the hospital Sherlock wasn't in the best condition, same goes for the restaurant, so Magnussen probably wouldn't have seen the need to have goons there. Sherlock and John visited Magnussen at Appledore on Christmas Day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his goons were allowed the day off.   But this is just my opinion so I may be wrong."
Sherlock,3d9ogi,torch3457,2,Wed Jul 15 02:46:27 2015 UTC,maybe Magnussen figured they wouldn't bring a gun to Sherlock's parents' Christmas get together. and he had goons on the helicopter that took them to his house right. maybe they had to cut out the scene where somehow Sherlock slips a gun passed the goons in the chopper.
Sherlock,3d9ogi,stratgedy,2,Wed Jul 15 08:37:54 2015 UTC,"That ep just didn't make much sense. Magnussen was nearly executed just days before they visited him, and he wasn't being careful about frisking them?"
Sherlock,3d9ogi,bonniedi,21,Tue Jul 14 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"Several months had passed between when he nearly got shot and Xmas. Mummy Holmes mentions something about Sherlock finally being well enough from someone putting a bullet in her boy and Mary is quite a bit more pregnant when we see her Xmas day at the Holmeses.  So it could be that enough time had passed that the feeling of danger has passed, besides which, he's pretty sure they're all neutralized. Sherlock was still recovering, Mary is rather pregnant and Magnussen is overconfident in thinking that he's got everyone under his thumb forever. He's also just so pleased that he's tricked Sherlock Holmes about Appledore, it never occurs to him how fatal the truth could be."
Sherlock,3d9ogi,Bobannon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"Another excellent point and one I should have included. You'd think after Mary broke into his office with the sole intention of blowing his head off that Magnussen would crank up his personal security...but somehow, it seems like he didn't?"
Sherlock,3d9ogi,Miknail,-4,Tue Jul 14 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"I believe this was just shitty writing. The writers had written themselves into a corner so they ""forgot"" plotpoints introduced earlier. Problem is, the viewers didn't."
Sherlock,3daf2t,i_feel_lucky_harry,7,Tue Jul 14 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"You are missing some things.  Sherlock doesn't get out of the trap by asserting Moriarty has a safe word, he gets pulled farther into it. The assassins will not pull the trigger only if Moriarty gives the safe word or Sherlock kills himself. Sherlock realizes Moriarty has a safe word and that's why Moriarty kills himself. He forces Sherlock to jump to save his friends. Moriarty doesn't care what happens to Sherlock's friends one way or another. All he wants is for Sherlock to be dead."

Sherlock,3daf2t,eeyore102,0,Wed Jul 15 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer! The problem I get with that theory is this: when Sherlock says ""You have a safeword. So I am safe, till I have you"", Moriarty could have simply said to Sherlock, ""Nice try, sweetie, but I have two words memorised, one of which kills all your little friends. If you try being naughty..."" It would lead to the same conclusion. Sherlock would have no option but to jump to save his loved ones."

Sherlock,3daf2t,broomsticks11,4,Wed Jul 15 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think Moriarty killing himself is him revealing that he is not ENTIRELY the genius we thought him to be.  Obviously he is a genius, but maybe it was to cement the idea that Sherlock is unbeatable. Moriarty's last action is suicide, to prevent Sherlock from winning. Like a child flipping a chess table to prevent anyone from winning, just because they don't want to feel like they ""lost"""

Sherlock,3daf2t,svmk1987,2,Wed Jul 15 10:05:19 2015 UTC,"Watch it again, Mycroft has people that come in to kill the assassins before Sherlock jumps off of the roof (maybe after, not sure, but I know it happens). What really happened is revealed at the end when Sherlock tells Anderson everything, knowing that nobody would believe him (Anderson) if he ever tried to tell since he had become a conspiracy freak on the subject.  I may be misunderstanding your question here?"
Sherlock,3daf2t,svmk1987,0,Thu Jul 16 07:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did watch that part. What I do not get is simply this: When Sherlock says to Moriarty ""I am safe as long as I have you. I'll extract the passcode from you"", how come Moriarty did not say ""Don't be a tart. I have two passcodes and one of them will tell my assassins to blow the brains out of your friends."" There is a precedence for this: Addler did the same thing with her phone. I am not questioning the actions of Sherlock or Mycroft. I am questioning the actions of Moriarty. I don't know- maybe this is the 'thing no one is talking about', and we will learn more in Series 4? :-)"
Sherlock,3d4in1,Bigoldthrowaway86,14,Mon Jul 13 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"Magnussen makes a seemingly throwaway comment while flicking John's face about how Janine made the funniest noises when he did it to her. I know he's twisted but I wouldn't have thought he'd make a habit of antagonising people in his inner circle unless he had something big on them.   I think that's just it. He has something on everybody. He wouldn't let anybody into his inner circle in the first place unless he already had something on them, in order to keep them in line, and ensure he could 'trust' them to not do anything detrimental to his plans.  There's no way he would let Janine (or anybody else) close enough to be an effective PA unless he could trust her, and the way Magnussen 'trusts' people is by controlling them through fear."

Basically, if Sherlock needed help into the building, why wouldn't Mary?  And how likely is it that she happens to be friends with the person who can help her?"
Sherlock,3d4in1,polybius2,3,Mon Jul 13 22:40:43 2015 UTC,I would hate the idea of Janine letting Mary into the apartment.  She made such a big deal about Sherlock using her that it just wouldn't fit.
Sherlock,3d4in1,AllThingsWillEnd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"But she'd only be using Magnussen, wouldn't she?  And he flicked her in the face.  And she wasn't that hard on Sherlock. He lied to her and used her. All she did was make some money off him. She didn't even tarnish his image--just said that he's a dick (which isn't news) and that he's great in bed. Fiddling with the taps is pretty bad, but chaotic neutralish."

In addition, this anxiousness explains why he attempted to embarrass John during his 'date' with Henry's therapist in order to prevent John from extracting information about Henry from her."

Off beat, but I also wonder if this Watson is going to be noticeably different in personality (perhaps a touch more self-important?) seeing as he may be making a pretty penny from the published stories (versus a blog with presumably negligible ad revenue). Would be fun to see these sorts of subtle ramifications between the different universes."

Sherlock,3cqfuj,chriscen,21,Fri Jul 10 01:44:39 2015 UTC,"I wonder how they get to/from this setting, or if the whole special is just set in Victorian times without any explanation or relation to the modern setting version."

Sherlock,3cqfuj,Swazzoo,4,Fri Jul 10 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'm less inclined to think that's going to be a huge part of the episode, and more inclined to think he brought it up because it was discussed in the preview clip."

The jokes were pretty dull and bad as well. Cumberbatch really doesn't fit in the whole theme and just looks wrong being there. Overall it just looks as a quite bad short skit.
Sherlock,3cslce,zobsterzombie,5,Fri Jul 10 13:02:13 2015 UTC,"Wiggins in the original stories was the leader of the Baker Street Irregulars (street urchins).

Unlike the other two definitions of ""edging"" so far included in this dictionary, it is not a practice necessary inclusive of masturbation (""wanking""), but is also practiced amongst homosexual (and, I suppose, heterosexual) partners/couples.     ""As we were edging,every time I got close to cumming, I'd withdraw and wait until immediate passion passed, and he would do the same, until neither of us could tolerate it any longer, and we both shot our loads:  mine in his mouth, and his on my abdomen.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

It is considered highly likely, but afaik is technically unconfirmed, that it will air in the UK this Christmas.   It appears to be set in the Victorian era, i.e. when the original Holmes stories were written and set.  That would seem to suggest it falls outside the main series continuity, but again afaik that's unconfirmed and it wouldn't entirely surprise me if Moftis had something cunning up their collective sleeves."

The woman found out about John's middle name from the wedding invitation - it is customary to list the full names of the bride and groom on wedding invitations. James Sholto was John's Army CO in Afghanistan, so the photographer had probably researched Sholto and realized that he and John had a close relationship. Therefore, he could guess that Sholto would venture out of seclusion for an important event such as John's wedding.  Hope that helps!"

Sherlock,3clcxr,dragongrrl56,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:54:05 2015 UTC,Oh good point!
Sherlock,3clcxr,ThinkingViolet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:53 2015 UTC,Didn't Sherlock say their bosses are not the same person?
Sherlock,3clcxr,dragongrrl56,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:21 2015 UTC,No. They were all the same. The man the Mayfly man wanted to get next to. That was Sholto.
Sherlock,3clcxr,MikkelMyers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"No, he flat out said that they weren't the same person. But he mentioned the high turnover rate for workers that sholto had, for security."
Sherlock,3clcxr,dragongrrl56,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:28:46 2015 UTC,My take was they were the same man in different disguises.
Sherlock,3clcxr,ThinkingViolet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:16:01 2015 UTC,I mean the soldier who send an email to Sherlock. Photographers have the invitations? Where did she saw the invitations? And photographer's brother died and he blame james so he needs to follow every step of james for all of those years. It seems a bit illogical to me. Thanks for your reply.

Sherlock,3cbmle,Emily89,4,Tue Jul 7 05:21:38 2015 UTC,The left part of his face is too angled up towards the perspective of the viewer. It should be a bit more slanted backwards (compacted toghether) I think.
Sherlock,3cbmle,alicecelli,3,Tue Jul 7 07:53:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input:). I will be careful next time,I find it tough to keep everything correct when I draw from  a reference :$"
Sherlock,3cbmle,Ridderdanske,3,Tue Jul 7 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"Try to focus less on shapes but more on negative shapes. So, when drawing a face, try to reproduce the shape of the background rather than the shape of the face (it is the same of course, but your brain does a lot of strange things with faces so it works better to focus on the ""outer shape"" of the face). Basically try to abstract from the fact that you are looking at a face and just try to draw what you see."
Sherlock,3cbmle,joeyjojosr,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:28 2015 UTC,Wow! That sounds like a really good method. I'll definitely try it when I try another portrait. Thank you! :D. Do you draw :) ?

Sherlock,3cc4js,dbadaddy,3,Mon Jul 6 23:11:10 2015 UTC,Nope! But I had actually read he was going to be in it also. He has such a distinctive look I think I could recognize him anywhere. It was fun to see him pop up on Game of Thrones too.
Sherlock,3cc4js,MissAnneThrop,5,Mon Jul 6 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"I saw him a few years ago when I caught a rerun of the Pompeii Doctor Who episode.  His charactee had the same smarmy attitude as ASiP cabbie, hah."

I don't know what to call it but I want them to be dicking each other over in humorous ways like that constantly.  It's not going to happen - BC has little enough time to do TV as it is and he can't be doing a spinoff instead of Sherlock. But it's fun to think about. And I would like to see Irene on the show again. There was a deleted scene from His Last Vow indicating they're still in contact (maybe - or maybe he hadn't heard from her until then)."
Sherlock,3c0uqq,mandym347,7,Fri Jul 3 19:25:08 2015 UTC,"If they stick to the original stories, though, she'll never show up again.  In fact, she's supposed to be happily married and out of England."
Sherlock,3c0uqq,deadgloves,12,Fri Jul 3 20:45:00 2015 UTC,If that were the case Moriarty would also only be in one episode and yet he was the main villain in two season finales and may be alive for season 4.

Sherlock,3c0uqq,deadgloves,4,Sat Jul 4 18:11:23 2015 UTC,And her death would just be a footnote comment mentioned in passing before a new case.   I'd laugh so hard if they did that.
Sherlock,3c0uqq,Char10tti3,3,Sat Jul 4 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"Her death wasn't even a footnote, it was Holmes saying Watson gad been selfish leaving him. Seriously."

Sherlock,3c0uqq,Veefy,5,Fri Jul 3 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"Slightly better premise would be if Irene created a new identity and started up some sort of blackmail/confidence trick/ PI agency, where she led a team sorta similar to the Hustle tv show and maybe also  used a bunch of Sherlock tactics like homeless network.  Then you could have the other cast members do cameos.  Probably go for a short season of 60 min episodes. Like anything youd need worthwhile interesting stories/scripts to sustain it."

He is showing more emotion in season 3, so you can read him now to some extent. Also when Sherlock was called back (after 4 minutes) it seemed like he really didn't know why Mycroft was calling him. So maybe Mycroft faked the broadcast?  Also who might have still had back door access to CAM's multi-media empire, including some sort of keys to the broadcast channels? Janine. You know how an ex-employee might create backdoors to an employer's systems before leaving. So maybe Mycroft and Janine working together?"

It's on Netflix streaming with the third season episodes. They seem to give a very different view of what they were trying to do with his return. I'd think the season three discs would have it too. All three of the Uncovered specials were excellent and I'd recommend watching all of them.

As tightly-written as the show is, I'd wager he and Gatiss did come up with an actual explanation, but what it was we may never know."
Sherlock,3bphut,TheCheshireCody,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:46:18 2015 UTC,What were all the 'tells?'
Sherlock,3bphut,happytormentor,5,Wed Jul 1 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, gosh, it's been a long time since I've seen the episode. Most of them are obvious - Sherlock kissing Molly, Sherlock kissing Moriarty (my personal favorite version) - and some less so. There was one story Sherlock told towards the end of the episode which on its face seems to be the truth, but I remember there being something about one of the gunmen (the one in the stairwell) that reveals it to be a lie as well."
Sherlock,3bphut,TheCheshireCody,2,Wed Jul 1 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"In the original conan doyle stories he does give an explanation (sherlock never fell, Moriarty fell and sherlock walked in the footsteps back over the ridge and waited for everyone to go.) Obviously that would not work in the show. What he told Anderson is what happened. There were 13 possibilities worked out with codenames, sherlock texted mycroft which one, mycroft told the gunman in the stairwell to  reconsider, sherlock hit the airbag. He begins to tell John the same story early in the episode but is cut off."

Sherlock,3bphut,SarahLou2510,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"No, but I think they will.  I really like the rhodedendron theory.  Here's an explanation by a skeptic.  The universe is rarely so lazy, and Mofftiss often forgo plausibility for emotional impact.  They could do a really weird, sad reveal where John finds out how dangerous Sherlock's fall was."
Sherlock,3bphut,polybius2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. The mystery is what keeps people going.  My personal theory is that he used the rubber ball to stop his heartbeat in that arm (an old magic trick), and that he simply jumped into the truck full of laundry, then used blood (procured by Molly) to make it a plausible fatal fall. Way less complicated (and requiring less people's involvement)."

He first thinks ""it would be fun to run a newspaper"" so that he can talk truth to power and stand up for the little guy.  Later in his career, he's become the power (or has attempted it) and changed so much that his partner sends him a copy of his original ""Declaration of Principles"" to show him how different he has become.  He has an affair with a common woman and then spends considerable time and money in forcing her to become a great opera singer despite her opposition and disinterest...  just so he can ""erase the quotation marks around 'singer' from the headlines"".  ""Rosebud"" is just a MacGuffin.  It's not the main story of Kane at all..."

She was only on one of the shorter stories in the books, IIRC? Plus, A Scandal in Belgravia kinda left it pretty cut and dry, since most likely, if she returned to England, she would be arrested/killed.

Sherlock,39uupm,JonnyShokker,2,Mon Jun 15 15:20:08 2015 UTC,"A Scandal in Belgravia(I despise the character of Irene Adler, but this episodes is just so well directed and acted in makes up for it) A Study in Pink His Last Vow The Reichenbach Fall The Sign of Three The Great Game The Empty Hearse The Hounds of Baskerville The Blind Banker   I think A Study in Pink has the best ""mystery"" aspect of any episode, and feels closest to the original stories. If I wasn't a fan of the originals, I would probably rank it much lower.  Belgravia is the best because of the music and the cinematography. I think Sherlock has the best cinematography of any television series, and it really shines in ASIB.  His Last Vow was the greatest on its first watch for me, but isn't all that great on rewatches. I think the most rewatchable episode is The Sign of Three."

Sherlock,39uupm,mansefson,3,Tue Jun 16 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"1.) A Study In Pink. It does a lot of the heavy lifting for series one... and it is a beautiful piece of work. Great re-watch value.  2.) A Scandal In Belgravia. There is a ton going on off camera in this episode. Everyone is on the board now, Adler, Watson, Mycroft, Moriarty, Sherlock.  3.) The Reichenbach Fall. The sequences in Kitty's house are just outstanding. The moment Sherlock realizes Moriarty means to kill him is an on camera moment... and every frame after that feels heavier because of it.  4.) His Last Vow. Another episode that does a lot of heavy lifting. Also, Molly in the mind palace.  5.) The Empty Hearse. I waited for this one. It does a fair amount of heavy lifting as well... and introduces us to Mary.  6.) The Great Game. It is a case-centric episode... which puts Sherlock in his element. The pool sequence is delightful to watch, Moriarty is brilliantly acted. Bonus. We get to see John work a case.  7.) The Blind Banker. M Theory has a really nice write-up about this episode, which wasn't one of my favourites. Still, after reading the theory (I'm on mobile, or I'd link it) I valued it a bit more.  8.) The Sign Of Three. This was a really entertaining, fun, bright episode for me... until the subtext starts kicking in and screwing with your feelings.  9.) The Hounds Of Baskerville. This is the most stand-alone of all the episodes. While Sherlock's fire-side delivered-in-one-breath-deduction is impressive as hell... I didn't like Henry. Or his therapist. Or the guy responsible for rigging the moor with psychosis-inducing-delusion-vapor. The scenery was great, but Sherlock belongs in London in my mind."

And the phone scene at the end still gives me chills. For some reason or another though, I seem to feel very different about Hounds and Pink than the other lists here. TBH it's been a little while since I've watched a lot of the series. I stand by my top three 100%, however."

Sherlock,39pfck,PokemonFan011,35,Sat Jun 13 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"A source said: ""Benedict is clearly very talented but a CBE is normally for those coming towards the end of their careers.""      Knight/Dame  This is awarded for having a major contribution in any activity, usually at national level. Other people working in the nominee’s area will see their contribution as inspirational and significant, requiring commitment over a long period of time.  Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)  This is awarded for having a prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.     But isn't, say, Dame Judi Dench a, well, Dame and not CBE? Seems more like a knighthood would be for the end of the career and CBE for major contributions earlier than the end?  American here who is unfamiliar with the system. My UK friends, please enlighten! (Oh, and will this make him a Sir or no?)"
Sherlock,39pfck,ademnus,27,Sat Jun 13 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"It can be quite confusing but here is the basic list of it all in order:  Knight Grand Cross or Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) (People are who given this and the one below are Sir's and Dame's)  Knight Commander or Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE or DBE)   (Kevin Spacey got the honourary version of this due to not being a British/Commonwealth citizen but for his work in the UK)  Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE)  Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE)  Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE)  So he's currently one below a Sir, there's no real rank to it and just because you have a CBE, doesn't mean you'll get a knighthood later but in his case, I'd say the chances are quite high considering his talent and portfolio, not to mention popularity  MBE and OBE's are in recognition of achievements and can be handed out to people at any age, CBE's and above are usually given to people who are older, at least 45+. Knight's are almost always at least 50+ because of the criteria- youre required to have done something truly amazing for it.

Sherlock,39o174,Char10tti3,2,Thu Jun 18 22:13:48 2015 UTC,I would be able to believe this more if it weren't Sherlock who was on the roof with him.  At that point Sherlock would be aware of any ploys like that due to the many different scenarios he and mycroft had prepared for.

He would be practical about it and possibly, although he cares deeply for John, not very empathetic or consoling. He would mean well but say all the wrong things. Which would really, really piss off John, I think. I would like to see them both struggle with how they are feeling after the death and toward each other, but need to work together to get to the person responsible for Mary's death, in the meantime coming to terms and cementing their relationship even more.

Sherlock,39ldxg,PepsiGeneration,2,Sat Jun 13 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"This would be such a departure from the books. In the books, John's bereavement over Mary was almost a non event. But then nothing about this Mary is like the books.  On the other hand if she goes full villain in season 4 and then dies, John would feel more betrayal than bereavement. We already see a sample of that in the ""domestic"" scene in His Last Vow. Many chairs will be kicked."
Sherlock,39ldxg,PepsiGeneration,2,Sat Jun 13 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'd love that.  After she goes villain (which she definitely will), it'll be the most surprising thing to do with her.  But I think she'd do something crazier and grander than that.  Maybe things'll get so bad for her that she'll be willing to sacrifice herself for revenge against Jim (for some reason.  I think he'll betray her).  But as a side-note, before she goes off to die, she'll acknowledge that this gives John a second chance, and that she wants him to be happy."

Sherlock,39ae4i,PCSFoote,2,Wed Jun 10 16:58:51 2015 UTC,It was okay. Really not the best convention I've been too. What was there was great but there just wasn't much. I mean it was a convention for a show with 9 episodes. Still a good day though!
Sherlock,39ae4i,PCSFoote,3,Wed Jun 10 18:33:08 2015 UTC,That's what I've been hearing generally. Apparently they are doing it again next year and adding a US location - we may look into it depending on where it actually winds up being held!
Sherlock,39ae4i,PCSFoote,3,Wed Jun 10 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"Ah lucky thing about Britain is it's relatively small so getting around isn't a problem like I imagine it being in the US.

Sherlock,396xx0,Lordeggsworth,7,Wed Jun 10 10:05:05 2015 UTC,"I agree he's a great actor, but because it was set in the 1800s and not the 2000s, his attitude and antics are way out I place. 1800s Sherlock isn't supposed to be exciting like that, the Brett and Livanov films were built more on suspense and story and less on characters. Edit: You can also blame the writers, it's not like RDJ completely did this himself."
Sherlock,396xx0,nibsti,2,Wed Jun 10 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree actually the writers and big production company are more to blame. I enjoy RDJ as Sherlock but I watch those movies as if they they have nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock,396xx0,bill_wayne,2,Wed Jun 10 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I've always said if they had given it any other title and named the characters differently, I would like it a lot more. They're not bad films at all, just bad Holmes films imo."

It's the AGRA USB that I'd also keeping Mary and John apart so he also throws this away so he can be with Mary

The fan theory (I think) you are referring was such an AWESOME idea, but was pretty much shot down in that article."
Sherlock,38wopp,AN4life,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a cool interview, but if we're talking about the same thing, there's other strong support besides the music.  I'm sure they can make decisions about what to reuse."
Sherlock,38wopp,polybius2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what am I missing in that scene?"
Sherlock,38wopp,EthanShmethan,3,Thu Jun 11 06:31:20 2015 UTC,"Irene says that John's in love with Sherlock, and John doesn't deny it. Sherlock overhears and runs away.   IRENE: Does [Sherlock not answering my texts] make me special?   JOHN: ... I don’t know. Maybe.   IRENE: Are you jealous?   JOHN: We’re not a couple.   IRENE: Yes you are. There ... “I’m not dead. Let’s have dinner.”   JOHN: Who ... who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but – for the record – if anyone out there still cares, I’m not actually gay.   IRENE: Well, I am. Look at us both.   John laughs ruefully   ""We're both attracted to women, and we're both in love with Sherlock. Yes, you're a couple and, yes, you're jealous.""  There are other interpretations, but they all depend on Irene being bad at sexuality or Moffat drunkenly putting random scenes in his script."
Sherlock,38wopp,polybius2,2,Thu Jun 11 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"Also, Sherlock ignores txt from other people in several episodes. She isn't special for being ignored like they speculate. John is because Sherlock always responds to his texts. Also John counts the exact number of times she texts Sherlock over several days. A rational level of concern would not explain that sort of behavior. You know what would? Irrational jealousy."
Sherlock,38wopp,deadgloves,2,Thu Jun 25 01:15:19 2015 UTC,Hadn't noticed that he ignores other texts!  Good point!
Sherlock,38wopp,polybius2,2,Thu Jun 25 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, how many texts does he ignore from Mycroft in the episode before? Not 57 but more than a few."
Sherlock,38wopp,deadgloves,2,Thu Jun 25 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"...yeah.  That's one of the main things he did that episode.  (Damn, Mofftiss.)"
Sherlock,38wopp,polybius2,2,Thu Jun 25 10:04:35 2015 UTC,"They do it constantly don't they?  Like in TSoT Sherlock says about a girl pacing outside, something like, ""Oscillating on pavement, always means a love affair."" and in the episode before John is oscillating in the same spot outside of Baker Street when he gets kidnapped and thrown in the fire."
Sherlock,38wopp,deadgloves,3,Thu Jun 25 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind pausing, there are fun things to pause on courtesy of the props department and post-production.  When Sherlock is looking through a microscope, see if there is a slide. There isn't always. I don't think this is an accident either. Sometimes Sherlock just wants to avoid conversation.  In The Empty Hearse, check Anderson's deductions wall. Some odd things there. Deduction walls are sometimes good to pause on.  Check the contents of Sherlock's folder in The Sign of Three in the scene in Molly's lab where Sherlock is asking Molly for advice on the stag night. Sherlock flips through the folder and you see maybe 2 pages for about a second each. One of them is hilarious. I defy you to explain to me what that paper has to do with alcohol volume.  Also in The Sign of Three, all the words on the screen during the stag night drunken deduction scene are well worth pausing on. In general the stag night scenes have lots of fun details.  Another one from The Sign of Three. When Mary is doing her 2 thumbs up gesture when Sherlock and John are leaving the flat, pause and see what is behind her head. It's either foreshadowing or just funny.  In His Last Vow you can pause on the words when Magussen pulls each person's pressure points onto the screen. Some pressure points are uninteresting and/or hard to read. But other pressure points are fun to read.   And I'll just tell you this one because it's hard to spot. In His Last Vow, when Anderson is searching the kitchen there is a bee decoration in the kitchen.  I can't wait to see all the pause-worthy items in the special."

I liked pretty much every episode, but hounds had some great build up with easily the worst reveal of the entire series. Maybe I'm forgetting some main storyline plot progression but I haven't rewatched that or the blind banker because I really just didn't love those ones. Think they're worth a watch?"

Sherlock,387ib8,polybius2,8,Tue Jun 2 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea though. It seems like Irene would have been an excellent resource for tracking down other members of Moriarty's network since she not only had worked with him in the past but also had access to lots of interesting secret information.   The single red rose in the hospital room after Mary shoots Sherlock is from Irene, by the way. Arwel Jones has confirmed it."
Sherlock,387ib8,polybius2,3,Tue Jun 2 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I'd be scared of her giving info to Jim, but Sherlock would have a way of knowing for sure.  YES!  I love it!  I think they're initially going to pin Jim's resurrection on her."

I would add one thing to his scene.

Sherlock,387ib8,Nicotineandsaccharin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:31:00 2015 UTC,"I like that he answered this question, put to rest the theories that they were  involved romantically.

Also, sherlock is not interested in relationships or sex and I think that is important to his character."

Sherlock,37bija,brown_felt_hat,8,Tue May 26 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda surprised he's bulking for Dr Strange,    Doctor Strange is pretty well-built and extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat."
Sherlock,37bija,Shaman_Bond,4,Tue May 26 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"He did go up two suit sizes for Star Trek if I recall, but yeah I never associate with 'buff' when it comes to him, but Strange isn't that muscular from what I can tell so he probably will go to Star Trek levels again.  Sherlock also gained more weight the more he was with John so I'm going to guess he'll go back to being a bit more of the 'healthier' looking Sherlock than S1/S3 Sherlock."
Sherlock,37bija,mollyhooper,3,Tue May 26 16:54:11 2015 UTC,but Strange isn't that muscular   Doctor Strange is very muscular and is quite an adept fighter.
Sherlock,37bija,Shaman_Bond,2,Tue May 26 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"Well I stand corrected, I'm not a Marvel comic girl though I prefer their Cinematic Universe. Guess he'll have to get much buffer then."
Sherlock,37bija,mollyhooper,11,Tue May 26 21:21:04 2015 UTC,I expect he'll stay bulked up. He was still pretty muscular for season three. I mean I wasn't watching his arms in those chains or anything like that but . . .  Oh yeah I was. Never mind
Sherlock,37bija,PepsiGeneration,5,Tue May 26 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"I think how he looks on Sherlock is based on whatever he was filming prior to filming the BBC Sherlock season. Third Star came before season 1, and in Third Star he was playing a cancer patient, so thin. Before season 2, nothing with special requirements. He bulked up somewhat for Star Trek prior to season 3.  While filming the special, he had the Oscar campaign for the Imitation Game, so short hair. Season 4 will probably reflect however he looks in Dr. Strange with maybe some time to regrow the hair."

Sherlock,37cl8d,Char10tti3,2,Fri May 29 03:17:05 2015 UTC,I think it was that Moriarty convinced everyone they knew each other and that he convinced everyone that he hired him so would know a lot about each other.

Sherlock,36zi6w,AnticitizenPrime,7,Sat May 23 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you there. I believe he would really be annoyed that people, to this day, still do not appreciate him for his other works, the ones he is particularly proud of. I don't really blame him--Sherlock Holmes has undermined his life's work as a medical doctor. He tried to kill Holmes off for good in Reichenbach but the readers wanted more. Doyle actually preferred to write historical fiction.    By 1893, Doyle had resolved to kill Holmes—""even if I buried my bank account with him,"" he wrote in his autobiography. He set the scene at Reichenbach Falls, an Alpine cascade in Switzerland. Doyle's editors despaired, but the author felt only relief: ""I have been much blamed for doing that gentleman to death, but I hold that it was not murder, but justifiable homicide in self-defense, since, if I had not killed him, he would certainly have killed me."" x   Doyle also complained, ""All things find their level, but I believe that if I had never touched Holmes, who has tended to obscure my higher work, my position in literature would at the present moment be a more commanding one."" He considered his works Sir Nigel and The White Company more satisfying to write, and that they achieved his ""purpose.""  But then, we're both only speculating. We'd have to ask the man himself what he thinks, which isn't exactly an option, obviously."

Sherlock,36mpxl,charliemike,12,Wed May 20 14:51:32 2015 UTC,She was texting him from a different phone after hers was confiscated. I believe Sherlock texted Irene on like New Years or something.
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,2,Wed May 20 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"That would make sense. But the phone Mycroft gave to John was the one she texted from during her capture. That wasn't the phone with the secrets. So it has to be a flashback then? Because at the time, Sherlock had it and was trying to figure out the pass code?"
Sherlock,36mpxl,ABashfulTurnip,16,Wed May 20 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"How i think it went,   Sherlock cracks her phone's password and gives it to Mycroft. Mycroft takes all the information off the phone rendering it useless as ""protection"" but still a working phone. Now Mycroft and everyone else has no need for it he gives it back to Irene (The phone still works but has nothing important on it.) Irene spends several months on the run still holding onto her phone.  She gets caught and Sherlock who gets wind of it saves her and helps her fake her death, leaving the phone behind helps sell the fact she is dead because she couldn't part herself from it even after it became useless. Mycroft recovers the phone while making certain that Irene is really dead ('We made sure this time, It would take Sherlock Holmes to fool me.' ) Mycroft puts the phone in the case file and gives it to John who in turn gives it to Sherlock at the end of the episode.   Either that or she had a separate phone from the beginning that she used to text Sherlock hence his customized ring tone still working.  Or you are correct and we are thinking way too in-depth about this and the writers just thought it would be a nice way to end the episode."
Sherlock,36mpxl,adjblair,12,Wed May 20 16:23:04 2015 UTC,I think she may have had a separate phone for texting all along. Doesn't she leave her main blackmail phone with Sherlock for months while he thinks she is dead? And then when she eventually needs it back she meets with John in the warehouse and texts Sherlock from a phone... Must be her texting phone because at that point Sherlock has her blackmail phone.
Sherlock,36mpxl,Angry_Bruce,5,Wed May 20 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"I agree--She tells Sherlock (or rather, Sherlock figures it out and she confirms) that the phone has been permanently disabled from wireless to preserve its contents. Blackmail phone and texting phone are two different items. Esp. because she texts Sherlock on christmas, telling him the phone is on the mantle. Hard to do if they are the same phone!"
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,5,Wed May 20 22:42:59 2015 UTC,Yes! That was what I was trying to think of. Aha I knew it was 2 different phones but couldn't remember when there was proof for it.  Her phone with secrets on it never had service.
Sherlock,36mpxl,tinkiebuns,2,Wed May 20 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Sherlock mentions that she would have had to permanently disable any uploading capabilities of her blackmail phone if she expected the blackmail victims to believe that there was only one copy of any particular photo.  Ergo, she must have two phones -- one with service and one just used as a camera."
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,1 point,Wed May 20 22:30:14 2015 UTC,Exactly.
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,1 point,Thu May 21 01:51:04 2015 UTC,I think the 2 phone theory is more plausible. I could have sworn she texted Sherlock while her phone was with him or something.   Could totally be wrong though
Sherlock,36mpxl,TigerPaw317,0,Wed May 20 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"This is the way I've always assumed it went down. The two-phones theory is possible, but IMO that turns into this intricate shell game that we mere mortals have trouble following."
Sherlock,36mpxl,magicaltrevor953,2,Wed May 20 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this, but I would say that:  The phone with the secrets would be in Mycroft's custody, the texting phone is used by Adler while she was waiting to be executed, its the normal phone that she uses to communicate (the special phone is in constant airplane mode). After Sherlock saved her I would guess she surrendered the phone to keep up the ruse that she was dead, Mycroft then acquired the special phone as evidence and gave the package to John after everything happened. He then gave it to Sherlock and he put it in his special drawer. He read the texts from Adler on his own phone while walking over to the special drawer. Watch the scene very closely, he puts the special phone in his left pocket and picks up his phone from the table with his right hand."
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,2,Wed May 20 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I missed that switch!"
Sherlock,36mpxl,Pokemonerd,1 point,Wed May 20 23:31:05 2015 UTC,How do you know that? Do you gave pics or something? And if it was the same phone then it would have the secrets. I'm confused by your reply. Aha
Sherlock,36mpxl,cuber_dude,2,Wed May 20 16:33:37 2015 UTC,I missed the slight of hand by Sherlock. He was reading his own phone and not hers. So my reply makes no sense :D
Sherlock,36mpxl,Achatyla,1 point,Wed May 20 23:31:50 2015 UTC,Haha yea. He's smooth like that.
Sherlock,36mpxl,cuber_dude,5,Thu May 21 01:50:52 2015 UTC,Its not the same phone as you cannot text from a camera phone .he said that in the show that it is not connected to any connection so it cannot be hacked plus she keeps texting Sherlock after giving him her phone
Sherlock,36mpxl,Achatyla,5,Wed May 20 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"What? Of course you can text from a camera phone!  I agree that she has two different phones, though."
Sherlock,36mpxl,Mysticum_,1 point,Wed May 20 18:12:17 2015 UTC,No that phone is supposed to not have any wireless connections because if it did someone can hack it and open the lock and if someone tried connecting it to something it would explode
Sherlock,36mpxl,AllThingsWillEnd,1 point,Thu May 21 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you meant from camera phones in general, not that particular one. My bad. Carry on :)"
Sherlock,36mpxl,phoenix0r,1 point,Thu May 21 10:31:30 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't get the problem, but maybe I'm just confused.  The rescue that we see in the end of the episode is clearly a flashback that took place in between Sherlock's reveal and Watson handing the phone to Sherlock. No doubt. She was put in danger, as is clearly stated when Sherlock breaks the passcode, and later she is taken to be executed and as a last wish she wants to send the ""Goodbye"" message to Sherlock.  All messages we see in the end follows this timeline, and I don't understand where the confusion is.  It could be discussed whether it's the same phone she uses, or a new one, but really: Does it matter? It could have been the old phone which she fetched after Mycroft cleared it of information. She then received it, sent the message, and then left it behind to trick people that she was executed properly, and then Mycroft fetched it again, handed it to Watson, which handed it to Sherlock.  It could also have been another phone, the same model, no problem. It's not a problem to have many numbers connected to the same conversation, I have it on many of my contacts in my cell phone, and they appear seamless in the same conversation window, even if they are sent from different numbers. It doesn't have to be a different number, she could have received the old SIM card, or cloned out a new one, or call the telephone company and make them send out a new one (that's really common actually)."

Not because of the comment, but because people think they're too clever to have missed anything as vital as the clue is supposed to be.  Yes, everyone's missed it. The clue is the stubble. It's so utterly obvious."
Sherlock,36jfkh,Dukes_Mangola,2,Wed May 20 06:33:38 2015 UTC,The stubble ?
Sherlock,36jfkh,Sydonahi,30,Wed May 20 07:05:04 2015 UTC,"In The Reichenbach Fall, Moriarty #1 is the cabbie who drives Sherlock in his cab. He's clean shaven.   Later that same night, Sherlock and Watson are at the journalist's house where they stumble upon Moriarty #2, who has a healthy stubble.   There wasn't enough time for him to grow out that stubble so soon, which leads Sherlock to the inevitable conclusion that there are two Moriarties. Notice how Sherlock gets dumbstruck, then contemplative and finally all smiley after spotting the stubble?  This is also an easy explanation for why Moriarty's re-surfaced after having blown his brains out. Having a spare copy of yourself is convenient.   ""I'm so changeable"" - this statement at the poolside wasn't just an allusion to a mental state by Moriarty. He's literally changeable."
Sherlock,36jfkh,Dukes_Mangola,5,Wed May 20 07:39:34 2015 UTC,This theory has been mentioned before. So either Moffat didn't look hard enough or that isn't it.
Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,5,Wed May 20 07:46:51 2015 UTC,But this is in the span of like an hour. That isn't realistic at all. And Moriarty is Irish. :p
Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,3,Wed May 20 09:02:27 2015 UTC,I doubt Moffat would take that root. The chances of it being someone who could grow stubble in an hour is very slim. I think it'll be a twin or something. I mean they ARE following the books.
Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,2,Wed May 20 13:21:25 2015 UTC,That's some nice stage makeup. :o
Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,3,Wed May 20 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"I hope it's not a continuity fault, that would be amazing."
Sherlock,36jfkh,Sydonahi,6,Wed May 20 14:05:28 2015 UTC,Of course! The clue is the subtle stubble.
Sherlock,36jfkh,4thguy,20,Wed May 20 22:10:47 2015 UTC,I think what I've missed is his comment.
Sherlock,36jfkh,ademnus,6,Thu May 21 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, we did, sadly. But when he put out the episode that was supposed to explain it all he didn't. That makes me think that quote of his was just there to build hype."
Sherlock,36jfkh,ademnus,2,Wed May 20 13:07:46 2015 UTC,I think theyre referring to his comment about the fall saying there was something that gave away the trick in the shows.  Not certain though.
Sherlock,36jfkh,NauticalxDisaster,3,Wed May 20 08:57:39 2015 UTC,"He did say that but that was a long while ago now and we've already seen that he never truly explained it anyway hehe. I'd think this has to be something more recent, about Moriarty."
Sherlock,36jfkh,ademnus,2,Tue May 19 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would think so too but I couldnt think of anything I've seen, although admittedly I haven't been following closely."
Sherlock,36jfkh,NauticalxDisaster,5,Tue May 19 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think he just wants people to keep talking about Sherlock. After such a long break fans have little left to talk about, so telling them they have missed something critical will keep them thinking for the next year until season 4 comes out...."
Sherlock,36jfkh,Sydonahi,2,Tue May 19 21:27:31 2015 UTC,I still maintain its the Rhodendron ponticum theory. The ball was too obvious.
Sherlock,36jfkh,DuchessofSquee,2,Tue May 19 21:15:22 2015 UTC,Care to explain? :p
Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,5,Tue May 19 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the episode when the kids are kidnapped he mentioned Rhododendron ponticum. It can make you appear to have no heartbeat (very very slow heartbeat) as well as teary eyes (the ""out of character"" thing Sherlock does while on the roof) and possibly other things I've forgotten."

Sherlock,36jfkh,Pokemonerd,5,Wed May 20 07:06:33 2015 UTC,I find it difficult to believe that Moffat has read every fan theory on the internet.
Sherlock,36jfkh,DuchessofSquee,2,Wed May 20 06:34:04 2015 UTC,Sometimes people go mad for one thing we think is quite trivial and completely ignore something we think is standing right in front of you   I don't think he was referring to the fall. That's the thing that everyone went mad for. Based on this comment I think he was referring to something less important which was still standing right in front of us. Can't say what this is because I haven't seen the series in far too long. I guess that's a job for my next few days!
Sherlock,36jfkh,paperclip1213,1 point,Wed May 20 07:45:42 2015 UTC,It was the squash ball.....

Sherlock,36jfkh,magicbananas00,2,Wed May 20 20:27:11 2015 UTC,It was the only out of character act he had...
Sherlock,36jfkh,AllThingsWillEnd,0,Wed May 20 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Copypasting my thoughts from an older thread.  I'm standing by my theory that Moriarty is a psychological splinter personality that Sherlock subconsciously created in order to satisfy his pathological need for a villain that can challenge him - The Final Problem. Richard Brook was really an actor hired by Holmes, acting under his Moriarty splinter personality. Consider: Moriarty shoots himself. Aside from the continuity issues in the visuals of the shot itself, Sherlock's entire motivation for meeting Moriarty on the roof is to unmask him and destroy the illusion of Brook, rather than die in shame and disgrace. Eventually he seems to accept his fate, 'confesses' to Watson, and jumps, thinking that by falsifying his death and temporarily sacrificing his reputation that he'll save his friends. However, even with Sherlock's death, there are ostensibly still a dead body and gun on the roof of the hostpital - a body that is clearly the result of a suicide, and that would presumably be identifiable as James Moriarty and not Richard Brook by none less than Mycroft Holmes, not to mention John Watson. Not only does Mycroft not do this before Season 2, the body is at no point alluded to. What happened to this crucial piece of evidence? It never existed in the first place. Moreover, with Moriarty's death Sherlock's only motivation now becomes saving his friends' lives, by dying. He stands to gain absolutely nothing by sacrificing his reputation before killing himself. He could just as easily have quickly explained to John the situation before jumping. Why does the eternally proud Sherlock Holmes choose to make a false confession to Watson and destroy his legacy, when all he needed to sacrifice at that point was his life? This is the break in character that I believe the creators are alluding to. The only reason Sherlock would tell this story is if he believed he stood to gain something and if he thought he would be believed - and the only way this lie is believable is if there is no body on the roof behind him to be identified as Moriarty. He's finally understood that Moriarty is, in fact, his own subconscious creation - his confession is genuine. Remember that probably Sherlock's most famous wisdom is that when the impossible is eliminated, whatever remains must be the truth. Moriarty is, quite literally, Sherlock - they both explicitly say as much to one another throughout their showdown. This theory also explains the screaming girl, and Moriarty's eventual resurrection. How Sherlock survived the fall is honestly irrelevant - this is the key detail that I think everyone is missing."
Sherlock,36cjj7,UserIBarelyKnowEr,29,Mon May 18 08:09:37 2015 UTC,"I am not a mental health professional, but I would still emphatically disagree with your diagnosis of Sherlock as borderline psychotic. Psychosis is defined as a disorder that includes delusions and hallucinations. Sherlock does not have delusions of grandeur, the guy really is brilliant. And nowhere have we seen him hallucinate except when he gets shot and is bleeding out. In extreme circumstances, such as at high altitude, for example, or when in shock, it is common (and not a sign of a mental disorder) to hallucinate. We have seen nothing to suggest that Sherlock does not function 100% in the real world. His mind palace is not a hallucination but mental imagery that he creates (knowing full well that it is fictional) as a memory aid. Sherlock calls himself a high-functioning sociopath but he does this for effect (he is a bit of drama queen), not because he believes he has a mental illness. Time and again, such as in his defense of Mrs. Hudson when she is attacked, his ""date"" with Molly, and in his relationship with John, he makes clear that he is not a sociopath."
Sherlock,36cjj7,catdoctor,2,Mon May 18 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"These are all good points and again, I'm aware the evidence is a bit shaky. This isn't what I hope or think will happen, I just think it's a possibility given the clues in His Last Vow and the fact that this is something like what Moffat would pull."
Sherlock,36cjj7,ForestfortheDraois,11,Mon May 18 23:46:37 2015 UTC,"Fight Club barely made this happen.  I don't think anyone else would be able to pull it off as well or again in the same way.  But I have a bigger problem with Sherlock having to prove his innocence for two years by dismantling Moriarty's network when it was his own network the whole time.  Makes the time in between Reichenbach and season 3 seem pointless.  I think that Moriarty locked in Sherlock's mind is just that evil, bad part of Sherlock that has taken the form of the most evil man he's ever come across.  In a way he finds some kinship with Moriarty, since the two are on a mental wavelength so high that few could ever touch them."
Sherlock,36cjj7,tessiegril,12,Mon May 18 14:42:59 2015 UTC,Ehhh But we seen Sherlock and Moriarty together with other people.
Sherlock,36cjj7,TheDoctorIsCoolLike,16,Mon May 18 10:13:00 2015 UTC,I think he means that Sherlock adopted Moriarty as a split personality after Moriarty killed himself.
Sherlock,36cjj7,TheDoctorIsCoolLike,3,Mon May 18 13:23:11 2015 UTC,Right. Sorry I didn't make that clear enough.
Sherlock,36cjj7,timewarp,1 point,Mon May 18 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought that was pretty clear."
Sherlock,36cjj7,flamesflight,3,Wed May 20 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"It could be that the actor that Moriarty pretends to be is actually an actor, not Moriarty."
Sherlock,36cjj7,ademnus,3,Mon May 18 12:28:15 2015 UTC,"I expect that the Andrew Scott portrayal of Moriarty will turn out to be a double (an actor portraying an actor portraying Moriarty) and that we will encounter the ""real"" James Moriarty in season 4. Recall the description of Moriarty in previous season as someone who does not directly involve himself."
Sherlock,36cjj7,johnsix,3,Tue May 19 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"Now it's possible he could have faked it, and certainly Sherlock doesn't look too closely at the corpse. But he looks pretty dead.   Well, the actor isn't dead, so clearly it's very easy to make that look real. Anything is therefore possible ;)  I don't know that I'd believe the show runners would make Sherlock have 2 personalities. It's not impossible, but I don't think they would. However, I DO think it's possible it could turn out to have been Sherlock, John, Mycroft or even Mary who put out the images in an attempt to save Sherlock. Maybe more likely his little club of internet fans because they'd have the skills to make and proliferate the animated images. John, I think, is lucky he can write a blog ;p  My gut instinct tho? It'll be Moriarty."
Sherlock,36cjj7,pottyaboutpotter1,2,Tue May 19 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"So, now that Moriarty is dead, Sherlock has subsumed his personality which will then start to leak out at some point, thus bringing Moriarty back in a sense?  I could see something like that happening in the next series."
Sherlock,36cjj7,jm001,2,Mon May 18 14:19:35 2015 UTC,"There was a play called The Secret of Sherlock Holmes which ended with the revelation that Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty were the same person.

They could work this into the show if Holmes ""adopts"" the Moriarty persona after Moriarty's death."
Sherlock,36cjj7,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Mon May 18 17:18:29 2015 UTC,Didn't they already work it into the show by having it be basically one of the main layers of the plot of The Reichenbach Fall?

Sherlock,360mis,PepsiGeneration,3,Fri May 15 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to promo a bit here. Hey guys, if you want to actively enjoy the BBC Sherlock fandom during the hiatus, tumblr is the place to be because there are so many active Sherlock fan blogs. It's much more active than this subreddit. The key, for the tumblr uninitiated, is to understand that all tumblr blogs are different and there is a wide variety. My advice is always to follow the blogs that match your Sherlock interests and opinions and ruthlessly unfollow the ones that you don't like. If you don't like gifs, don't follow blogs with gifs. If you don't have a ship, find blogs that don't ship. Or maybe find blogs that ship only your favorite ship. (Hey redditors, there are some beautiful adlock blogs on tumblr). Then you discuss things within your small but active circle of like minded blogs. That is the tumblr concept of ""staying in your lane"", something I admit I don't do very well when I'm on reddit. But whatever your tumblr selections you will likely get an abundance of news about the show, setlock pics, and other general fandom stuff."

Sherlock,360mis,PepsiGeneration,3,Sat May 16 01:47:25 2015 UTC,And the mobile app is basically a self torture device. But I do use the web site despite it's faults.
Sherlock,360mis,BetterCalldeGaulle,4,Sat May 16 17:10:05 2015 UTC,I think as a blog platform it isn't bad. Fairly intuitive text formatting. But as a social platform it is almost incomprehensible... and yet there I am.
Sherlock,360mis,whiplash588,-2,Mon May 18 00:59:18 2015 UTC,Go ask non-redditors where SJW's are born and you'll get the same answer: Tumblr
Sherlock,360mis,TheToto1000,6,Fri May 15 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"Well then again just because Nazis are born in Germany doesn't mean it's not a beautiful country full of non-Nazi people.  The skeleton part of Tumblr is like the SRS of Reddit, you only see it if you subscribe to it, otherwise the website is just a place to talk about things you like with other people."
Sherlock,360mis,whiplash588,-2,Fri May 15 20:28:16 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. People who don't go on Tumblr know that Tumblr is the birthplace of SJW's because you don't have to visit the website to hear about it. My dad, for example, is aware of Tumblr and its SJW's without ever having been on the site. This is because they inject themselves into everyday life. I agree that, for the most part, Tumblr is a great site where people can share ideas and entertainment, but it does leak out to the real world. Which is why people don't like Tumblr."
Sherlock,360mis,earthtoannie,2,Fri May 15 20:46:56 2015 UTC,Because a small but vocal minority is ruining the reputation of a site with 6 million users.

Sherlock,360mis,trevdordurden,6,Fri May 15 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"It could be worse. Doctor Who was in hiatus for 5589 days, with only a TV movie in between."
Sherlock,360mis,Have_A_Jelly_Baby,3,Fri May 15 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"DW had audio and book adventures in the interim.  It wasn't gone completely.  Also, being canceled is totally different than a three year wait between seasons."
Sherlock,360mis,Pokemonerd,1 point,Fri May 15 17:23:44 2015 UTC,So it was cancelled? Thats what I thought but I'm not 100% sure now.
Sherlock,360mis,Pokemonerd,1 point,Fri May 15 18:14:17 2015 UTC,That's true.   Was it like a random cut off though for classic who? Or like did they plan the cancelation or something?

Sherlock,360mis,PepsiGeneration,3,Fri May 15 19:38:09 2015 UTC,And then there was the 1969-1987 Star Trek hiatus. But the Star Trek fandom just got more and more active during that time. I think the key to enjoying the hiatus is enjoying the fandom during the hiatus.
Sherlock,360mis,Pokemonerd,2,Sat May 16 17:14:59 2015 UTC,Was it an actual hiatus or was the show canceled or something?
Sherlock,360mis,PepsiGeneration,1 point,Sat May 16 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"It was canceled, so not an actual hiatus. There was no real hope of a renewal. But over the years the fandom grew and grew.

Sherlock,35uc9y,initiallyperk,44,Wed May 13 22:50:22 2015 UTC,February 2023 to be more realistic.
Sherlock,35uc9y,leonsugarfoot,10,Thu May 14 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. We have to find a way to get rid of Mary and her baby. Of course it's going to be dark. The only questions are: Do they get killed? Who kills them, and why? Does Mary leave, taking the girl with her?  If so, why? How is it that Sherlock can't find them? I guess we'll know sometime late 2016 or early 2017. So.... Breathe."
Sherlock,35uc9y,catdoctor,2,Thu May 14 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"early 2017.   This is mind boggling to me.  I'm about to move to a different city, for two years with the possibility of returning to London if I keep my head in my books and my eye on the prize.  I would return in early summer/late spring of 2017.  I could have been through everything and I still won't have seen the 4th series of Sherlock."
Sherlock,35uc9y,fulfilledprophesy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there is the Christmas special at the end of 2015. Cumberbatch will be playing Hamlet starting in September, so I assume he will be starting rehearsals soon (if he hasn't already) and won't be available to start filming the next Sherlock until it is over at the end of October. That is, provided he does not go into filming Dr. Strange at that time. I have no information about Freeman's schedule (and I'm too lazy to google it).    Doctor Who usually starts shooting in January and goes on for several months. I think it unlikely that Steven Moffat will want to shoot Sherlock at the same time, but what do I know? If I am right about that, then Sherlock couldn't start shooting until the Summer of 2016 at the earliest (unless they sneak it in during November and December of 2015, which feels unlikely since, hey, everybody wants to spend the holidays with their families and writing Doctor Who would be ongoing). Given this, the earliest I think we could expect to see Series 4 of Sherlock would be January 2017. We will all be a little older and, hopefully, a little wiser by then. Enjoy your time in that other city and the fact that you get to return to London. The best I can hope for in a 11-day holiday there in October. Can't wait!"
Sherlock,35uc9y,catdoctor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:06:43 2015 UTC,We don't know that Mary or/and the baby are dying for sure. We just know that there will be a death
Sherlock,35uc9y,catdoctor,6,Thu May 14 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"We also know Mary dies in the books and there was no baby, so I'm pretty sure they have to go."
Sherlock,35uc9y,Char10tti3,2,Thu May 14 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Mary disappears and the only mention after is Sherlock mentioning when John was ""selfish enough"" to have a wife. It was quite creepy, maybe Sherlock kills her?"
Sherlock,35uc9y,fulfilledprophesy,2,Sat May 16 22:13:14 2015 UTC,These are my several thoughts on the matter:  Mary might not be the person that she appears to be.  The baby might not even be his? He loses his wife and child.    Mary dies while pregnant.    Mary dies giving birth?
Sherlock,35uc9y,Char10tti3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:42 2015 UTC,I totally agree that is possible but I think that the writers will have a twist on the way there just because they know most of the viewers are expecting it now
Sherlock,35uc9y,fulfilledprophesy,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:07 2015 UTC,"I'm also expecting 'The Dying Doctor' rather than 'The Dying Detective' and also for that not to be the obvious 'John fakes his illness'.  It could be someone making John legitmately ill to get back at Sherlock until we realise he isn't legit sick, John knew he was being poisoned and was faking it to draw the bad guy out.  Something like that."
Sherlock,35uc9y,Char10tti3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:31:45 2015 UTC,That would be cool. I think think they tried something similar in the warehouse where john pretend to be sick sherlock so it was really a double bluff
Sherlock,35uc9y,morphinapg,5,Mon Jul 13 15:18:04 2015 UTC,I think that's good. Season 3 was fun (for the most part) so it's nice to have some balance against that.

Sherlock,35uc9y,Ciderglove,2,Fri May 15 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"We'll get the Christmas special this Christmas but the actual series four will begin shooting only in spring 2016. This is mainly because Benedict Cumberbach and Martin Freeman will be shooting for Dr. Strange and Captain America: Civil war respectively. So, series 4 will mostly air in 2017"
Sherlock,35sqav,_exobot,16,Wed May 13 04:48:52 2015 UTC,"IMO its unlikely Moriarty is coming back. But if he is, then may be he really did have a 'master key code'. They never explained how the juror's tellies were hacked or how Richard Brook was created. Again in the start of season one, Moriarty was referred to be more than a man and perhaps, an organization. May be they are bringing the other canonical James Moriarty (brother with the same name) into the picture.   But Moriarty storyline aside, who exactly did that stunt benefit?  Sherlock.   My bet is Mycroft or Sherlock or Mary or Adler, alone or in collaboration with others pulled it off to save Sherlock.   Anyway that was one mother of Deus ex Machina and it would be pretty entertaining to see Gatiss and Moffat explain it away."
Sherlock,35sqav,Enigmaniac_,7,Wed May 13 06:25:42 2015 UTC,Another theory that popped into my mind was that Moriarty was pulling a Joker (again). SPOILERS - Joker dies in Arkham Knight and a set of wheels is set into motion which is designed to wreck Batsy and Gotham from beyond the grave.

Sherlock,35sqav,Char10tti3,31,Sat May 16 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be disappointed if it is Moriarty. He definitely died prematurely in the overall arc of the show, and Magnusson wasn't that great, but this will be turning into Doctor Who if people just keep faking their deaths and coming back when it suits them.   I HOPE Moffat/Gatiss are smart enough to not go down that route again..."
Sherlock,35sqav,Azzah,23,Wed May 13 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"Knowing Moffat, it's Moriarty. Or you'll spend the whole year being led to believe it is, find out at the end that it isn't, and then be given the flimsiest explanation. Moffat's strengths are very clearly in characterization. Both on Sherlock and Doctor Who, I can always count on the characters to be fully realized and thoroughly entertaining -but I can also count on the background plotline to be shoddy and unsatisfying. I think back to the Impossible Astronaut arc on DW, for example. It started out SO good and ended up positively absurd."
Sherlock,35sqav,ademnus,14,Wed May 13 07:22:21 2015 UTC,Season 7 Clara would disagree on the fully realized characters point
Sherlock,35sqav,hologramleia,5,Wed May 13 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"Clara previous to this last season was 2 dimensional and lacked personality. And her plot arc went off the rails.

Sherlock,35sqav,bort_sampson,1 point,Wed May 13 15:51:55 2015 UTC,Maybe because Anderson had investigated the fall and presumed prosthetics where involved he found some and there was a second Jim?

Sherlock,35sqav,bort_sampson,1 point,Wed May 13 15:52:45 2015 UTC,The books had a lot of faking deaths too.
Sherlock,35sqav,alexxerth,9,Fri May 15 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping it is a series of 'video wills' similar to the sir boasts a lot story Moriarty left behind to be implemented in the event of his death for the giggles.  I'm also hoping that the person doing that is Sebastian Moran the lethal sniper and second in command to Moriarty's empire. They used a Lord Moran in 301 for the bomb plot as a name drop for nods to the source but that doesn't exclude some cold hearted mercenary like sniper allied to Moriarty named Sebastian.  For interesting character interactions you can make that sniper someone who served with Watson, possibly as a good friend or on his last mission that got him injured, and get to play around with his military history through a villain."
Sherlock,35sqav,OpinionatedFudgeCake,2,Wed May 13 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"I second that, I don't believe Moriarty is still alive... it could very well be Moran trying to make it look like he's still alive.

Sherlock,35sqav,anroroco,1 point,Wed May 13 13:55:39 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he got himself Kitty Riley as a pet
Sherlock,35sqav,onetruepurple,5,Mon May 18 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"While this is an interesting idea, and definitely not impossible, I do see a few elements of it that are a bit odd.  In the episode itself the 'did you miss me?' is simply a picture being animated and some distorted audio. So this doesn't have to be Moriarty doing it.   After the credits we did get a picture of Moriarty himself, in the flesh, asking that question. Whether that is a tease for the audience or actually part of what is going is unknown, but is rather a promise to us that 'Moriarty' (in some form) is back.   It could be a new villain using Moriarty as a way to get to Sherlock. We'd probably get a lot of Moriarty tormenting Sherlock in his mind then.   The other possibility is that Moriarty is alive. However that would mean that the two of them both faked their death at each other. Now Sherlock he had to fool an assassin and John and he had to go so elaborate for that already.   Moriarty shot himself through the roof of his mouth in front of a man whose primary skill is noticing things. Moriarty faking his death would require a HUGE explanation and I would lose respect for the writers if they hand-waved that just to bring back a popular character.  My theory is that yes this is Moriarty doing this and yes he is dead. Moriarty went on that rooftop hellbent to make Sherlock fall, to tear him down. He was prepared to take his own life, but beyond that point he had to trust that Sherlock would actually jump and die.  For Moriarty this was the end-game, one he had been building towards for so long.  We know he has a vast network of people and criminals. Enough contacts to get to jurors and create a false identity with Richard Brook. That is more than just a single man's work. That is someone with resources, money and a lot of time on his hands. And all that seemingly focused on the singular goal of 'the fall'. Which if Sherlock fools the right people... fails.  My guess is Moriarty had an ally with which he prepared the potential of Sherlock fooling him and surviving. Moriarty planned to die. Which would give Sherlock a false sense of security.  The idea of showing back up in the life of the great detective after killing himself in front of him. It would be a delicious idea for Moriarty.   So my guess is that somewhere a plan existed in case Sherlock Holmes showed up again in the public eye after supposedly killing himself.  For example if he were to shoot a public figure. Lot's of press about Sherlock Holmes. Which may have triggered something.   A computer program based on news? A henchman waiting to push a button?   I like to think that we'll get this next season."
Sherlock,35sqav,Sanderf90,5,Wed May 13 07:20:31 2015 UTC,"One thing that always bothers me when it comes up in this sub is the automatic assumption that if moriarty is alive that it's due to lazy/bad writing. How do you know? Maybe the writers have an incredible explanation. You can't call it lazy just because we haven't come up with a good theory yet. That's presumptuous.  Also, the main argument most people make when saying Moriarty has to be dead is that he kills himself right in front of Sherlock Holmes. The man whose power of perception is everything. Surely Holmes would know if Moriarty were faking it, right?  Probably. But the question I haven't seen asked yet is: What would Sherlock do if he did notice the suicide was fake?   Would Sherlock stand there deadpan, not amused, and just retort ""Oh come on now. Don't be so dramatic."" And wait for good ol' Jim to sit up?  What would his options be if he knew there were still snipers pointed at his loved ones and he already had a ""fake my own death"" plan set up that he needed to execute to save them.   Maybe he would go through with it and then spend a couple years in hiding dismantling Moriarty's criminal network because he knows he will eventually be back. Oh wait...  I'd love to hear this sub's thoughts on that question. What does Sherlock do when he sees the suicide is fake."

How do you know? Maybe the writers have an incredible explanation. You can't call it lazy just because we haven't come up with a good theory yet. That's presumptuous.   It's not about the explanation. Sure you can ""explain"" why nobody seems to die on Sherlock or Doctor Who, sure it can make sense in universe, but it's not powerful writing. Powerful writing would be killing Moriarty in a bold move at the end of the second season, only to never hear from him again. It would be introducing a new villain in season 3, and not kill him suddenly to bring back the fans' favourite. It's not so much being lazy as it is completely ridiculous.  Bringing everybody back from the dead (sometimes multiple times, looking at you Rory, Clara and River) completely destroys the very point of an emotional death, even if you have a good explanation for doing so."

The question I pose in the rest of the post is what I really want your (and everyone's) opinion on."

Also, as many people suspect, Moriarty MIGHT be related to Sherlock. If you recall when Mycroft says 'you know what happened to the other one', (referring to a third Holmes brother), many people thought it could be Moriarty. The writers might expand on that a bit."
Sherlock,35sqav,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Wed May 13 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"It would fit with Magnussen's introduction.  Crazy crime with no explanation at the time.  Personally, I thought that was kind of sloppy."
Sherlock,35sqav,polybius2,2,Wed May 13 14:49:30 2015 UTC,I can say that Moriarty will be in the one off special (watch out for a purple KKK-esque costume!) but I'm not sure if he'll be back for season 4.
Sherlock,35sqav,GuiltyCynic,1 point,Wed May 13 16:02:02 2015 UTC,What? Pics or links or anything?

Sherlock,35sqav,Pokemonerd,1 point,Wed May 13 20:00:46 2015 UTC,So there was an English KKK?
Sherlock,35sqav,CassandraDyke,2,Fri May 15 20:24:25 2015 UTC,Well the original stories had them in a lot but I don't remember if they where all in America or not. The Great Game's phone pips was the orange pips from the KKK
Sherlock,35sqav,Char10tti3,1 point,Sat May 16 22:07:03 2015 UTC,Haha I don't think so. The costume is more of a 'cult' type deal than an anti-black 'gang'.
Sherlock,35sqav,GuiltyCynic,1 point,Fri May 15 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"KKK?  If that's actually happening, that means they're doing the five orange pips. I love that story.    Still wish they'd do the Musgrave Ritual."
Sherlock,35sqav,Redkirth,2,Tue May 19 07:43:29 2015 UTC,"In the books Holmes was always up on the latest technology. I would not be surprised to find that Sherlock has some mad computer skills - or can learn them in short order to beat a master cybercriminal. I hope you are correct about Moriarty not coming back. In the books, he died at the Reichenbach falls and never came back. I think (hope!) Moffat an Gatiss will respect that."
Sherlock,35sqav,catdoctor,2,Wed May 13 13:10:14 2015 UTC,"He never came back but his brother James, both James, hated Sherlock and tried to get his revenge in the press I think"

Killing himself to force Sherlock to jump sounds like something a psychopath would do. And everyone keeps faking their deaths, its getting kinda old. There's no surprise anymore if you know they are not really dead.   If it was him, why was the audio all played with (and the picture too)? He could have just used an actual video of him. Would have been more effective on the scare tactic. Was very convenient timing too..."
Sherlock,35sqav,Pokemonerd,1 point,Wed May 13 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"I thought it might be Janine as in canon Moriarty had a brother, also called James (Seriously nearly every character is John, James, Mary or Charles) and they where both presumably Irish.

Sherlock,35mr76,PepsiGeneration,28,Tue May 12 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"Silly thread. ""Sherlock"" will be whatever the ""Sherlock"" creators want to give us. It is, after all, a vanity project. We are lucky (damn lucky!) to get anything at all. I find it best to stop thinking of this as a TV show and consider it more a movie franchise. If this were ""The Avengers"" or ""James Bond"" fans would be thrilled to get one movie every 2 years. We get THREE movies every 2 years or so. And they are great. We are lucky."
Sherlock,35mr76,catdoctor,13,Mon May 11 22:09:46 2015 UTC,Your point still stands but it's worth mentioning that there are multiple Marvel movies a year
Sherlock,35mr76,UpliftingTwist,16,Mon May 11 23:53:36 2015 UTC,Well if Sherlock made Marvel sized profits there would be multiple Sherlock movies per year too. Spawning spin-offs and franchises all over. Mrs. Hudson would have her own pre-Baker street movie of her drug dealer/stripper past.
Sherlock,35mr76,Hadouken_Facial,2,Tue May 12 00:39:41 2015 UTC,If it was written with the same humor/style of sherlock I could actually see myself watching that....

I never understood why people would prefer this. When i first watched Sherlock i was delighted that you got so much rather than always have a cut at the exiting point to ""continue next time"" .. This format works for Sherlock and sets it apart from most TV Shows :)"
Sherlock,35mr76,swoop_dk,5,Tue May 12 07:40:58 2015 UTC,The disruption of continuity would be something from /r/mildlyinfuriating

Sherlock,35mr76,MetalliMunk,3,Tue May 12 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"No. They'd be garbage. I like the 3 episode arc, long movie-ness of them. Not junkfood eat them up and then they're gone of a weekly series, but a deep satisfying of a good meal."
Sherlock,35mr76,kimwim42,2,Tue May 12 17:00:11 2015 UTC,Do you want this to be the last season ever?
Sherlock,35mr76,Captrotc,2,Tue May 12 02:33:50 2015 UTC,That would be horrendous.  Stick to the British style of 3 episodes per season.
Sherlock,35mr76,derevenus,2,Wed May 13 21:35:06 2015 UTC,I agree. It's basically three movies and they're all fantastic in their own way. Some are better than others but they are all better than just about anything else on TV or in the movies.

Sherlock,35mr76,Pickles256,1 point,Wed May 13 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"No. Absolutely, positively not.   Limiting the number of episodes keeps the stories moving along at a respectable pace while leaving less room for throwaway episodes. It's a focused, intense storyline...   In fact, I wish more shows would take this approach."
Sherlock,35mr76,truthcopy,1 point,Thu May 21 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"How about 4 or 5 episodes?  Or maybe just do the series every year, instead of every two years."
Sherlock,35mr76,kutwijf,2,Tue May 12 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"I can't be the first person to tell you they can't, due to scheduling conflicts with the writers and actors. It's very much a low priority project."

Sherlock,35mr76,kutwijf,2,Tue May 12 06:51:33 2015 UTC,Because all the main people involved make millions of dollars in their other jobs and they (naturally) put those jobs first.

Sherlock,35mr76,kutwijf,0,Tue May 12 15:57:41 2015 UTC,I think a high-quality animated series for adults voiced by Cumberbatch and Freeman would be a cool addition to the mix.

Sherlock,35mr76,Have_A_Jelly_Baby,3,Tue May 12 01:01:25 2015 UTC,"We're lucky to get 3 movies as often as we do. 4 every year would take way too much time out of Benedict & Martin's busy schedule. I would be okay with 1 movie every so often, but it would probably end up being 1 per year with a model like that."
Sherlock,35iro6,polybius2,33,Sun May 10 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"I also got the impression that John didn't really keep in contact with a lot of the people that he met via Sherlock in the years that Sherlock was gone. So Molly probably felt bad, but didn't see John often enough to be tempted to tell him."
Sherlock,35iro6,firemoo,20,Sun May 10 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I think her first loyalty is to Sherlock, period. And while difficult to keep everything from those that loved Sherlock, it think that being his secret keeper meant more to her,  most importantly it kept him safe.

Sherlock,35iro6,lapisdragonfly,11,Sun May 10 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Having strong morals made her less likely to tell John. Telling him would have been the easy, cowardly thing to do.

Sherlock,35bw1b,Sarithus,42,Fri May 8 20:45:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Moffat and Gattis don't even know.

Sherlock,35bw1b,ProfWhom,1 point,Thu May 21 01:57:14 2015 UTC,His main theory is the one he is narrated to Greg but the one sherlock says is 2nd one that actually plays in his head .why do you think Sherlock is there and then he disappeared .
Sherlock,35bw1b,rorking,46,Thu May 21 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"And then Anderson starts to tear it apart and comes to the realization: ""Why would Sherlock ever tell the truth about how he did it?""  Most viewers interpret this to mean that Sherlock did not actually divulge how he did it."

The whole point of that exchange with Anderson and indeed the entire episode was loving satire of the fanbase. And as it is every time Holmes reveals his magic, the only answer is ""is that it?"" It has been confirmed by the show creators, that the explanation at the end is the more or less ""true"" version. They're coy about it, but anything else would be reading much too into things."
Sherlock,35bw1b,AllThingsWillEnd,6,Sat May 9 02:18:47 2015 UTC,"From what ive read here, most people on this sub reddit had nodded towards it not being true. However it is the most plausible and possible but I think the only reason Anderson says ""why would you tell me that? I'm the last person you would tell that"" is more of answer to the fans. His character has practically become an embodiment of the fan base, while one side of him goes ahh yes I see now, the other goes nah that's impossible to many variants.   I personally believe it's not true because the writers don't know how either, hence the 3 separate theories that were in the episode. They agree on the most plausible one but won't confirm it, which is stupid unless how he survived becomes a major plot point later on or they just can't figure it out.  Edit: no downvote here mate, you argue appropriately and offer evidence. The reddit hive mind is the silly one."
Sherlock,35bw1b,_exobot,-1,Sat May 9 02:44:20 2015 UTC,Seriously?
Sherlock,35bw1b,TheKharmeleon,2,Sat May 9 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"The bungee jump reveal wasn't the real one, it was the solution a fan really wants. A fan doesn't want a dry explanation with a stuntman pad. No, the fans want something sensational, action-packed, romantic, over-the-top, and--why not--featuring a real-life celebrity cameo. That's why we got our hero bungee jumping, crashing through windows, making out with Molly and doing a cool saunter away into mystery. It's the least disappointing on a visceral, limbic system sort of way out of the endings you see, and if you ask yourself, you'll realize that it was the one you really wanted, even if it's completely ridiculous. It's got a bang to it. You love it.  I think the writers knew the fans wanted a real bang out of how he survived, but knew that the one with the landing pad (which is clearly the ""official"" canonical one, since they keep referencing it as fact) would be disappointing, so they made a big, dumb, fun, silly, but undeniably awesome beginning, and that's the one that's most fun to watch.  The stuntpad one is the real one. That's why Sherlock thanks Molly and says she was the most important in his plan. And we see Mycroft's involvement in his disappearance. All the references to his faking his own death follow the stuntpad explanation.  If that's not the real explanation, I'd venture to guess that there was no coverup--Sherlock really jumped, he just survived. He cared enough about his loved ones to actually risk killing himself. It makes sense and follows Sherlock's tendencies to get bogged down in details when the answer is actually staring you directly in the face."

Sherlock,35bw1b,Stratisphear,23,Sat May 9 04:11:39 2015 UTC,Part of the fun is that they never explicitly tell you
Sherlock,35bw1b,mrfobwatch,34,Fri May 8 20:55:09 2015 UTC,Your idea of fun? My agony ;)
Sherlock,35bw1b,sovietsrule,11,Fri May 8 21:23:37 2015 UTC,The explanation is that Sherlock did it because he's really really smart. He's so smart that he could do that and way smart enough that you wouldn't understand how his smart did it.
Sherlock,35bw1b,Dims0,6,Fri May 8 21:50:33 2015 UTC,Just like Albit Einstein. He could do it.  And he's wicked smaht.

Sherlock,35bw1b,Bented,1 point,Sat May 9 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Albit, checks out!"
Sherlock,35bw1b,BloodyToothBrush,31,Wed May 13 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"Um, it's been confirmed by Gatiss and Moffat that the explanation he gave Anderson is the truth. I don't know why people are still discussing this. Sherlock is not a liar, in the first place. He is honest to a fault and bound by the truth, that's why he is so hard to get along with. That's his entire character personality."
Sherlock,35bw1b,lilcashew,20,Sat May 9 04:12:21 2015 UTC,"People think that Anderson's reaction of ""why tell me?"" means Sherlock was lying. But I think that Sherlock was desperate to tell anyone about how clever he is, since John refused to listen to his brilliance this time."
Sherlock,35bw1b,wishicouldtravel,7,Sat May 9 10:32:28 2015 UTC,"People think that Anderson's reaction of ""why tell me?"" means Sherlock was lying.   I cant believe the amount of people that have bought into this, they are falling into EXACTLY the category of people that the scene was making fun of"
Sherlock,35bw1b,kimbiablue,3,Sat May 9 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Thank you."
Sherlock,35bw1b,AerosolHubris,3,Sun May 10 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"But in TRF, the sniper on John put away his gun on his own after seeing Sherlock jump. That episode was not narrated by anyone. In Sherlock's account in TEH, Mycroft's men got to the sniper."
Sherlock,35bw1b,polybius2,6,Sun May 10 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"Just a nitpick, but I think the ""honest to a fault"" bit that you said probably applies more to him being blunt about observations, not about whether a story he tells is true.  As for him being ""bound to the truth"" - I can see why people would think he'd be like that since he's all about the pursuit of facts and solving cases, but again, perhaps that doesn't apply to things he does or says personally. Look at all the times he's lied to various characters, especially John, about big or small things.  With all that said, I've never been able to decide if I believe the story he told Anderson or not. XD"
Sherlock,35bw1b,speedraver,1 point,Sat May 9 19:51:31 2015 UTC,Is there a reference for this? I'd like to see Gatiss confirm it.
Sherlock,35bw1b,Ragadash7,1 point,Sat May 9 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Sherlock lies sometimes.  Like when he pretended he knew how to fold napkins because he's a badass before he admitted looking it up on Youtube.  And Moffat lies aaalllll the time.  He lied about Moriarty.  And he said Sherlock would never do drugs in the show.  And Lazarus doesn't make sense.  If Mycroft can just call off the snipers, then Mycroft can just call off the snipers.  And to satisfy the snipers, Sherlock has to convince them he's dead, which he couldn't have done with Lazarus."
Sherlock,35bw1b,Its_Always_420,5,Sun May 10 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, in isn't explained very clearly either in the original story's, because at the time Doyle wanted to quit writing about Holmes, thus actually killing him off at the Reichenbach Falls (The Final Problem). Due to the ongoing success of the story's however, he eventually revived Sherlock in 'The Adventure of the Empty House', only giving a vague explanation.  And that's exactly what Gatiss and Moffat are doing also: the fan theories following the end of season 2 were so wild and over the top, that it was an impossible task to give one conclusive answer that could live up to the expectations of the fans. Instead, they show 3 possible explanations, going from might be plausible to completely ridiculous, and leave it to the viewers to choose which one (or none of them) they believe."
Sherlock,35bw1b,AnonSweden,3,Sat May 9 12:15:44 2015 UTC,They say for sure in the audio commentaries that the one sherlcok had video taped was the real one.

Sherlock,35bw1b,OpinionatedFudgeCake,5,Fri May 8 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Wasn't this explained? Didn't he just jump onto a large, soft mattress-thing?"
Sherlock,35bw1b,bn_melissa,-3,Sat May 9 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Well Anderson contradicts that after explaining it. So we actually never got to know how he did it, which i m guessing is what they planned to do."
Sherlock,35bw1b,cuber_dude,1 point,Sat May 9 03:19:20 2015 UTC,Anderson suggested the bungee cool intro to the episode to Lestrade who told him he was incredibly dumb for suggesting it. The goth fan suggested the romance funny team up with Moriarty to parody the fanbase.  Sherlock told Anderson how he done it and that's it. The issue was put to rest for the sake of putting it to rest. The reason he told Anderson was because he was the only interested in hearing it.  Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson were just happy to see Sherlock and John wanted to know Why not How.
Sherlock,35bw1b,B_Vainamoinen,1 point,Wed May 13 07:39:51 2015 UTC,"When you see the original fall scene, the s02e03, there is no rope. So I think he didn't do that plan. I assumed it was just one of Anderson's theories. My problem is, I don't know if Sherlock tells the truth to Anderson - in Anderson's words, he would be the last person Sherlock would tell such a thing to. However, that version does include the collaboration of some 25 people from the homeless network, just like Sherlock told John in s03e01.  About Moriarty's suicide and Sherlock's shocked expression: Sherlock told John that he had considered 13 scenarios. So I think he thought that death could possibly happen, but was nevertheless purely shocked when he saw Moriarty shoot himself."
Sherlock,35bulo,Sarithus,49,Fri May 8 20:33:47 2015 UTC,You either didnt watch that episode properly or you paused it to ask this question. Darren Brown wasnt there. It was one of the Sherlock fans' theory. The sniper was threatened I believe
Sherlock,35bulo,H_Junior,7,Fri May 8 22:42:15 2015 UTC,By Mycroft
Sherlock,35bulo,Quazz,1 point,Sat May 9 14:11:38 2015 UTC,Allegedly
Sherlock,35bulo,polybius2,3,Sun May 10 19:50:17 2015 UTC,"Either threatened or eliminated. I keep thinking of how Mycroft said on the phone, ""Is it done? ...Good."" I can't imagine someone like Mycroft leaving loose ends."
Sherlock,35bulo,eeyore102,8,Mon May 11 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the sniper was threatened by one of Mycroft's gunmen in the building, ""invited to reconsider"". He packed up once Sherlock had jumped, probably because he was something like told ""Sherlock has jumped. Your job is done, now you go and tell everyone else at Moriarty HQ what you just saw, and we won't have any problems"". That would have also meant the other two assassins would be called off from actually murdering them. Also the Derren Brown thing was just one of Anderson's 'silly theories', not the one Sherlock explained. The rest of the stuff that went into it would have been seen (well some would) by Shootyman, but he was already dealt with."
Sherlock,35bulo,magicaltrevor953,21,Sat May 9 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"It would stand to reason that he was focused only on John and therefore was not watching what was happenning after the jump. He was probably told not to shoot unless doesn't Sherlock jump. Sherlock jumped, his job is over. Time to get out of town."
Sherlock,35bulo,duncanwally,3,Fri May 8 20:45:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I had this question too. Why wouldn't the sniper see the fakeness of the death jump?
Sherlock,34z7a3,punkist1984,42,Tue May 5 19:54:12 2015 UTC,Holy shit
Sherlock,34z7a3,martens92,27,Tue May 5 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"I know. I'm really freaking out right now. He was soooo good in Sherlock, and even better in Fargo the miniseries, I just can't wait to see how they cast him."
Sherlock,34z7a3,impshial,29,Tue May 5 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"I also enjoyed him in The Hobbit, Love Actually, The Cornetto Trilogy and The Office."
Sherlock,34z7a3,Ninjaspar10,17,Tue May 5 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've pretty much loved him in everything he's ever been in because he's so good at little subtle movements and looks to say things without ever actually having to say anything. Some of his short films are honestly the best.   I just want to kiss you is such a perfect example of what we end up seeing in his later acting. Pretty much throughout, he plays this zany, class clownish guy who seems really confident and who picks up girls easily, but there is this moment at about 9:15 that the girl he likes is actually about to kiss him and he just goes still, and looks terrified... And without his saying anything, you learn something so profound about his character.   And he has only gotten even better at it with time. Truly one of my favorite actors."
Sherlock,34z7a3,Darkimus-prime,2,Tue May 5 20:38:40 2015 UTC,Do you have an idea of who he's going to play?

On the bright side Civil War is filming pretty soon (it is slated to come out before Strange) so we might not have to wait much longer than we already had to with Benedict on Strange.

He said that he doesn't really write unless he's under real pressure, and without his writing, it doesn't matter if the actors have time, we still won't be getting any further"

Still a superhero property, but for the most part feels VERY down to earth and real.  i think the marvel movies are all spectacle, but its spectacle with characters who have this vibrant and LONG history in another medium.  It's why the harry potter films were popular, and the twilight movies, and the hunger games.  There is a large segment of the population that is used to seeing these characters in one medium, and is thrilled to see them coming to life in another medium, and having that done in a shockingly competent way. I think another big factor behind the success is that they have all been (mostly) really fun movies.  It's not Anna Karennina, it's not Grapes of Wrath, but it's  straightforward fun. I would put it above Transformers bc the one thing Marvel has done consistently is make inspired casting choices.  Michael Bay lets the CGI do the heavy lifting, Marvel makes the actors do most of the work.    This was a long answer, and you probably didn't read it, but i wanted to answer your question and not just reflexively downvote you for having an opinion."

A big part of me thinks Moriarty's dead, but there is a piece that thinks Moriarty and Sherlock did have an agreement to let each other hit the ""reset"" button, so to speak.   If you compare Moriarty in the end of Season 1 to the Moriarty in Season 2, something's changed. Moriarty confronting Sherlock in The Great Game is happy, with a singsong, taunting voice. He's having fun.   In their confrontation at the end of The Reichenbach Fall Moriarty just seems.. off. It's obviously still Andrew Scott, but I felt like he was different. He's lost most of the happy taunting demeanor, and is gruff and angry. He's kind of unhinged. He says it himself, now that he's beaten Sherlock he will have to play with the ordinary people again.  So I think it's possible JM and SH came to a gentleman's agreement to not declare victory yet, but to lie low and come back to things later.  It's also possible Moriarty really is just dead. :("

Sherlock,34wcy1,GamePhysics,45,Tue May 5 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"No, it was a reference to the Holmesian catch-phrase ""It's always 1895.""  It was first used by Vincent Starrett in the following poem:  221B  Here dwell together still two men of note  Who never lived and so can never die:  How very near they seem, yet how remote  That age before the world went all awry.  But still the game's afoot for those with ears  Attuned to catch the distant view-halloo:  England is England yet, for all our fears—  Only those things the heart believes are true.  A yellow fog swirls past the window-pane  As night descends upon this fabled street:  A lonely hansom splashes through the rain,  The ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet.  Here, though the world explode, these two survive,  And it is always eighteen ninety-five.    Starrett used it again in his essay ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes""  (excerpt)  But there can be no grave for Sherlock Holmes or Doctor Watson . . . Shall they not always live in Baker Street? Are they not there as one writes? . . . Outside the hansoms rattle through the rain, and Moriarty plans his latest deviltry. Within, the sea coal flames upon the hearth and Holmes and Watson take their well-won ease . . . So they still live for all that love them well: in a romantic chamber of the heart, in a nostalgic country of the mind, where it is always 1895."

Sherlock,34wcy1,lanternsinthesky,3,Tue May 5 09:39:53 2015 UTC,"IMO both the hit-counter and the special are a homage to that year and its significance. Doyle tried to kill of the Great detective in his second collection ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"" published in 1895. But what Doyle didn't count on was the fact that the Sherlockians and Holmesians, as a brief perusal of tumblr would prove, are mad. But we didn't need Benjamin Cumberclutch to drive us so. We were always mad. Even in 1895. The reaction to the great detective’s death was extreme. The Strand Magazine lost 20,000 subscribers — and fans of Holmes took to the streets wearing black armbands.  Doyle ignored them for a while until his pocket-book began to bite at him. Then came Hound of Baskervilles and finally in 1903 the Return of Sherlock Holmes (probably the first major retcon in literature).  Doyle hated Holmes with a passion. Holmes was his Frankenstein's monster. He wrote - ""I have been much blamed for doing that gentleman to death, but I hold that it was not murder, but justifiable homicide in self-defense, since, if I had not killed him, he would certainly have killed me.”  But Holmes lived. And he still lives. And it still is 1895."

Sherlock,34u7jd,Numendil,4,Mon May 4 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think we did, I kinda assumed that they said that to throw us off."
Sherlock,34u7jd,Amyga17,3,Mon May 4 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"I think we can assume it was the ball Sherlock was playing with, which  turned out to be integral to his fake death."
Sherlock,34u7jd,yelkca,3,Tue May 5 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's the inhaler noise. Watch when Moriarty blasts the security guard with the inhaler at the tower, then the same audio is heard when he pulls the trigger to himself. Presumably he used his same knockout gas on himself. There's some YouTube clips about it, but I'm too lazy on mobile."
Sherlock,34u7jd,QueenGonzo,4,Tue May 5 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"But... pieces of his head/brain were floating in his blood? And I'm guessing there was a hole somewhere, don't think that could have been faked."

That or Molly dies, she serves no more purpose if Sherlock has the chick from the wedding to be interested in and her death will give us the answer to what she did."

Sherlock,34u7jd,KaiG1987,0,Sun May 10 06:13:19 2015 UTC,The thing everyone missed was from series 2 so it can't be Molly's fiancé.  Also Sherlock's interest in that woman wasn't romantic
Sherlock,34u7jd,DaLateDentArthurDent,1 point,Tue May 5 18:18:28 2015 UTC,"Re read the article- Moffat mentions something they set up in the 3rd season, no one is talking about."

Then the new series will start and they'll do something different just because.   I say ""cynical,"" but it could be done very well, just depending. But having both Sherlock and his wife die in such a short span seems so cruel to John."
Sherlock,34u7jd,AN4life,7,Mon May 4 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"The special is set in a different time period, it won't be part of the regular series' story. I'm pretty sure they'd devote the time that Mary's death deserves, and the mourning period and all that would follow."
Sherlock,34u7jd,Camnesia,2,Mon May 4 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Probably. Like I said, its just the cynic in me."
Sherlock,34u7jd,AN4life,0,Mon May 4 22:40:44 2015 UTC,"But how can you be cynical about a situation that couldn't possibly happen? You're cynical that they are going to kill off Mary in a one off special that takes place over a hundred years before the actual series. That's not cynical. That's illogical, my dear friend."
Sherlock,34u7jd,Bogey_Redbud,6,Tue May 5 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"Does it bother anyone else that no man, especially one as fashion-conscious as Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be, would have worn a deerstalker cap in Victorian London?  As a fan of ten years, I've sort of come to grips with it in most other adaptations, but I would've thought that Moffat and Gatiss would have been more on top of those kinds of details...  EDIT: Which isn't to say that I'm utterly disgusted with the show! I love it way too much, and I'm thrilled that we're getting a Victorian episode. Just checking to see if anyone shares my minor nitpick about the hat."
Sherlock,34u7jd,GooGooGajoob67,10,Mon May 4 20:51:50 2015 UTC,But the original character of Sherlock Holmes DID wear one... did he not? Or is that an invention of the movies?
Sherlock,34u7jd,catdoctor,9,Mon May 4 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"I think the illustrator did draw him with one, but only in more rural settings (which is appropriate). Then stage and film adaptations kind of ran with it, and now it's iconic.  Ninja edit: It's explained here."
Sherlock,34u7jd,GooGooGajoob67,2,Mon May 4 21:39:49 2015 UTC,Very nice!  Thanks for the thorough explanation.
Sherlock,34u7jd,catdoctor,3,Mon May 4 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"The way Gatiss and Moffat have handled the deerstalker on the regular series tells me that they are well aware of the reality; it's an homage to how the hat was misattributed. Perhaps, for this Victorian special, they are simply going with ""full-on iconic."" Or, perhaps, there will be a good reason as to why he wears it. We'll see, I guess."

So it makes sense he would have contacts who would inform him of these facts. The real mystery is precisely how he could have become involved with Moriarty. Did he read of the trial in the papers? Did he have some dirt on Moriarty and use that to get info about Sherlock/John/etc?"

Sherlock,34b78e,polybius2,25,Wed Apr 29 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"In TRF I believe John's therapist is trying to get him to admit that Sherlock is dead out loud so that he can accept it and begin to move on. On the tarmac I think Sherlock could have been wanting to say any kind of emotional thing to indicate how much John means to him, but he didn't really need to say it. His actions had already spoken louder than words. Incidentally, I have always perceived it as a friendship love and not as a romantic one. Edit: spelling"
Sherlock,34b78e,ThinkingViolet,6,Thu Apr 30 04:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the scene in TRF, but yeah, the tarmac scene I always saw as nothing romantic, but as Sherlock trying to diffuse the tension, to make his best friend laugh. Because from what I know of British men especially, the touchy feely stuff isn't common/is uncomfortable."
Sherlock,34b78e,bencumberbatch,3,Thu Apr 30 21:47:31 2015 UTC,This is what I always thought too!
Sherlock,34b78e,ginger_jedi,5,Thu Apr 30 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"But he kicks off the episode by saying, ""My best friend, Sherlock Holmes, is dead."""
Sherlock,34b78e,eeyore102,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but she has to coax him to say it. ""You need to get it it,"" she says. I thought that was the scene the OP was mentioning."
Sherlock,34b78e,ThinkingViolet,3,Fri May 1 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, at the end of the episode, presumably after he opens with ""My best friend, Sherlock Holmes, is dead,"" the therapist tries to get him to say ""all the stuff he couldn't say"", and he refuses.  So ""dead"" and ""best friend"" are off the table.  And Sherlock being one of ""the two people I love most in the world"" came out without much drama."
Sherlock,34b78e,eeyore102,3,Fri May 1 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"I thought OP was talking about this scene near the end of the episode:  Therapist: The stuff that you wanted to say. But didn't say it...  Watson: Yeah.  Therapist: Say it now.  Watson: Well... I'm sorry, I can't."
Sherlock,34b78e,ThinkingViolet,3,Fri May 1 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. In that case, I would change my answer to everything that John says at Sherlock's grave instead (i.e., one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've ever seen on TV). :)"
Sherlock,34b78e,eeyore102,3,Fri May 1 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. All that stuff about him being the best man...that was it. Oh, and, ""Don't...be...dead."" T.T He might have been afraid to say it in front of Ella or heck, in front of any other human being, in case they thought he was nuts.  UGH I just want to cry now."
Sherlock,34b78e,LasagnaPhD,62,Fri May 1 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do think they both meant to say ""I love you."" I don't think their relationship is necessarily sexual (at least not from John's end). But they are most certainly the loves of each others' lives, whether you see it in a platonic or romantic sense, but they're both too emotionally constipated to talk about it directly."
Sherlock,34b78e,galexybabe,26,Wed Apr 29 20:02:05 2015 UTC,And one day they'll say it to each other and I will be over the moon. I don't care if it's romantic or platonic.
Sherlock,34b78e,bencumberbatch,43,Wed Apr 29 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"In a way they did, in TSOT, indirectly.  John: ""I want to be up there with the two people I love and care about most in the world...Mary Morstan, and you.""  ...  Sherlock: ""Today you sit between the woman you have made your wife, and the man you have saved. In short, the two people who love you most in the world.""  That whole episode was such a wonderful tribute to Sherlock and John's relationship, however you choose to see that relationship (for me it's just friendship but whatevs)."
Sherlock,34b78e,galexybabe,7,Wed Apr 29 21:42:30 2015 UTC,You're right they do say it indirectly and that's probably why TSOT is my favorite episode.
Sherlock,34b78e,eeyore102,5,Wed Apr 29 23:26:48 2015 UTC,"But the tarmac confession came after that, so there's is still more.  Arg!!  It's so maddening!!!"
Sherlock,34b78e,deadgloves,7,Thu Apr 30 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean did you see Mycroft's eyebrows go up when Sherlock asked for a moment alone to speak to John, one last time? That look, you could almost hear him thinking, ""Holy shit, he's actually going to tell him, Sherlock's actually going to tell John he's in love with him.""  It's almost literally the epitome of the ""Aborted Declaration Of Love"" trope."
Sherlock,34b78e,aPlasticineSmile,5,Fri May 1 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"No shit, Sherlock. :) They've both easily admitted to platonic love so what else is there to say?"
Sherlock,34b78e,lucidflower,5,Sat May 2 18:53:25 2015 UTC,I think John said 'it' at Sherlocks grave.

Sherlock,34b78e,Dan14469,3,Wed Apr 29 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"I think unsaid thing is always ""I love you."" The therapist thing was admitting sherlock was dead, but sherlock and john have never said I love you specifically. NOT SEXUALLY, just as best friends. It's unsaid because it can be, because they understand. Sherlocks best man speech said it, johns confession at the grave said it."
Sherlock,34b78e,PepsiGeneration,5,Fri May 1 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"But they both say ""I platonically love you"" before they admit there's something they haven't said."
Sherlock,34b78e,LiamIsMailBackwards,1 point,Sat May 2 06:43:22 2015 UTC,"Lets get this straight - John and Sherlock are 100% not in love with each other in a romantic sense. If they were, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have commented on it or made it clearer in his books.   I think they love each other in the 'friend' sense as they have such a close relationship and would be 'nothing', to an extent, without each other now. This can be seen through the amount of mourning that John does and how hard he takes Sherlock's 'death'.  But I don't think its at all possible for them to be gay for each other."
Sherlock,34b78e,PepsiGeneration,25,Wed Apr 29 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. At the time Arthur Conan Doyle was writing, it would have been impossible for him to comment on it. You should look into how it was for writers at the time. Even heavy subtext (as with Oscar Wilde) would have been too risky. So we just don't know. It is very much an open question.  And in any case, BBC Sherlock can interpret their characters however the writers like. Look what they did with Irene Adler and Mary Morsten and James Moriarty.  If you want a devotedly faithful and non-controversial rendering of the tales, catch up on old episodes of the Granada version. It is really very good."
Sherlock,34b78e,RavenclawHouseRules,13,Wed Apr 29 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"I understand that a lot of people want there to be romantic connections between the two, but I'll put it from my personal experience:  My best friends and I have been through so much shit (like all best friends) that I basically am in a serious relationship with them. I treat them how I would treat a significant other, but I don't have any romantic feelings for them. I love them all, and I let them know my feelings, but none of those feelings will ever turn into a romantic attraction to them because, simply, they are men.  Look at JD and Turk! They are absolutely in love with each other, but they still are straight. The fact that JD told Elliot that he loved her more than Turk and she was beyond flattered was proof enough to show that two men could love each other and not be romantically involved. It's just Guy Love!"
Sherlock,34b78e,PepsiGeneration,20,Thu Apr 30 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"Guy Love is totally a thing, should be the subject of more media, and is fucking awesome.  But in Sherlock, there are a bunch of scenes that are harder to explain without straightforward romance.  The tarmac scene, the stag night, the whole dancing thing, big swathes of ASiB, the dinner in ASiP, all the innuendo in TGG and TBB, John's blatant jealousy towards Irene and Janine.  And even if you don't see it, just because it can be interpreted as platonic doesn't mean it can't be legitimately interpreted as romantic.  (If you think the writers are crazy enough to plan a secret romance, which I do.  I mean, ""It's been a romance the whole time!!"" is way less ridiculous than, like, literally anything in HLV.)"
Sherlock,34b78e,deadgloves,5,Thu Apr 30 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"I loved the JD and Turk friendship on Scrubs. And also House and Wilson on House MD. There are lots of those great examples of strong male friendship on TV, in movies, and throughout the entire history of literature. It is a guaranteed successful formula. I am not failing to consider that at all. In fact I would say that when two men are very close, the default assumption is that they are not romantically involved but rather very close friends. But if two men on TV are clearly shown to love each other, must it always be platonic? Is there no other possibility?"
Sherlock,34b78e,Bitawit,2,Thu Apr 30 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Also House and Wilson on House MD. There are lots of those great examples of strong male friendship on TV, in movies, and throughout the entire history of literature.   House and Wilson were designed to be like Holmes and Watson. A lot of elements from the ACD stories ended up in the show."
Sherlock,34b78e,FrumpyCheel,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:49:47 2015 UTC,Yes indeed! And the influence goes both ways. I've sometimes wondered if the drop of blood at the end of the BBC Sherlock credits is a nod to House MD. I've also sometimes wondered if BBC Sherlock owes some of it's dark-ish characterization to House MD. House MD is and excellent example of a modern day very close platonic Holmes and Watson.
Sherlock,34b78e,Char10tti3,8,Thu Apr 30 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"His friend, Oscar Wilde, was put on trial and sentenced to hard labor in 1895 because of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. A law that basically said even implied sexual deviance (no proof of sodomy needed) could result in jail time or worse. This was just two years after the first story was published.  I'm not saying ACD had any intention of implying a non-platonic relationship between Watson and Holmes but it is absolutely wrong to say that ACD would have easily made it clearer in his books if a gay relationship his intent."

Gatiss and Moffat have said on numerous occasions their two leads make scheduling a nightmare."
Sherlock,3460oq,Xais56,-7,Tue Apr 28 20:32:28 2015 UTC,it's more like moffat and gatiss haven't written any episodes for season 4.

Sherlock,3460oq,deardot,4,Tue Apr 28 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"i wonder how long they think we think it takes to film a movie.  it's not much more than 6 weeks in most cases.  source: i use to work on film sets.  big films.  halloween.  going south.  nashville.   none of these took more than 2 months, tops, to film.  more like 6 weeks.  the writer of the sherlock series just said that season four hadn't even been written yet.  not 'polished, edited, re-worked'.  written.  they previously said they were going to be filming in february, march, april of 2015.  after they finished the special, for release in january 2016.   now they are saying they're going to be filming it in 2016.  by the time they get around to airing the episodes, i'm not sure i'm going to care to follow anymore.  i'm not going to be their captive audience, waiting with bated breath.  they have a responsibility to their audience as well as to 'their schedules'  and i don't think they're really aware of that."
Sherlock,3460oq,BigBearKitty,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"True, but that is also a multi part movie. I would imagine it takes longer to film what will become 5-6 hours of movie."
Sherlock,3460oq,chris569x,-4,Wed Apr 29 08:38:07 2015 UTC,Chris Evans came out? When?
Sherlock,3460oq,liflon,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:40:23 2015 UTC,Mainly Dr Strange I'd say. The filming of that was pushed back so everything else would have been as well. Sadly marvel (billion dollar industry) beats public funded show.
Sherlock,3460oq,SirAlexH,0,Wed Apr 29 08:55:01 2015 UTC,they haven't even written any season four episodes yet.
Sherlock,3460oq,BigBearKitty,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"I mean they said that, I know :B But later they said it wasn't film, but as I said I'm not sure, I just hope it's soon :c I really want to see what's up with the ending of season 3, And I want to see what's sup with the special, because it's already filmed and well Christmas 2015, feels like an eternity haha."
Sherlock,3460oq,issacfunny,7,Tue Apr 28 20:59:34 2015 UTC,Welcome to the sub. And to the waiting. The only real answer to your question is that we will see Season 4 when the Powers That Be are good and ready to show it to us. Sigh

Sherlock,341ill,JScottMO,120,Mon Apr 27 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"I believe that the joke there is that an English man who would wear scuffed (indicating daily wear) American-style cowboy boots to a wedding in England is so insecure about his masculinity that he's heavily compensating for it. Presumably Sherlock already peeked at his crotch and ruled out penis size, leaving erectile dysfunction as the last explanation. The visual hint there is the shot of the boots from overhead and the bullet ricochet noise."
Sherlock,341ill,kozmund,14,Mon Apr 27 18:21:21 2015 UTC,This is the most logical explanation.
Sherlock,341ill,charliemike,15,Mon Apr 27 18:57:39 2015 UTC,"Elementary, my dear charliemike."
Sherlock,341ill,ademnus,10,Tue Apr 28 04:03:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! I had no idea that was a thing.
Sherlock,341ill,rosie_the_redditor,6,Mon Apr 27 20:05:15 2015 UTC,I'm surprised this was missable - cowboy boots are such blatant shorthand for insecure manhood that people who just happen to like them have actually noticed the stigma and stopped wearing them. It's an ancient trope.
Sherlock,341ill,Mik0ri,21,Mon Apr 27 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's easily missable if you aren't immersed in a subculture where ""cowboy boots are such blatant shorthand for insecure manhood"". The Internet connects you to people all around the world. I'm surprised you didn't know that.  But all sarcasm aside, where I come from, an insecure man wouldn't wear cowboy boots because they are in style...for women. Boots most definitely wouldn't qualify as blatant sign of insecurity for that reason alone and they aren't even entirely out of place on men...especially those into horseback riding. I just assumed it fell in the category of ""Sherlock observation that he isn't going to explain."""
Sherlock,341ill,bonly,5,Tue Apr 28 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe in other places, but I'm from Texas. Cowboy boots are worn unironically by a lot of people around these parts, and many people have multiple pairs - everyday cowboy boots and dress boots."
Sherlock,341ill,Abstruse,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:47:34 2015 UTC,so... lots of people having issues in Texas?
Sherlock,341ill,jrwn,2,Tue Apr 28 21:38:28 2015 UTC,Not in my personal experience.
Sherlock,341ill,Abstruse,4,Tue Apr 28 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe where you're from. I don't think men here in Tennessee would give a shit about if you thought they were emasculating. Cowboy boots are shorthand for ""I ride horses"" or even ""I work on a farm and don't want crap on my pants."""
Sherlock,341ill,WeSingVeryLoud,2,Tue Apr 28 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"I think the part that makes it easier to miss is that the scuffing marks on the top are evidence of the type of car he drives, and the visual cue is just changing the camera angle, seemingly showing no new information. So, I understand how people could miss it."
Sherlock,341ill,kozmund,9,Mon Apr 27 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"I assumed it was a build up for his ""an extra deduction"" trick that he pulls with Mary and the fact she's pregnant. Other than that there is no point to it, even as a joke it's quite poor for how good and subtle some of the jokes are.   EDIT: he even explains it after, ""there was one more deduction there than I thought."" It shows how much the whole wedding day distracted and stressed maybe even."

Sherlock,341ill,aforsberg,3,Mon Apr 27 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Very real possibility (although others in the thread have mentioned a cowboy boots theory), its a problem when as a normal person you're trying to create someone so abnormal with apparently superhuman powers at times; sometimes you've got to cut corners to create the magic."
Sherlock,341ill,Xais56,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think he's just saying that he's over-compensating for something and the general deduction would be something genital-related.   For example, when me and my friends are walking down a street and someone drives past revving their engine to show off we all just say 'over compensating'. This this is the case with the guy at the wedding."
Sherlock,33teo2,Sabe24,86,Sat Apr 25 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"I don't want any explanation on why it is set in that time. I just want the whole thing set back in the day as if every season were like that, no reason needed, just for fun."
Sherlock,33teo2,onyxpup7,29,Sat Apr 25 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"I can think of a second reason, too. There's one big advantage to this show suddenly being re-set in the past.  Moriarity isn't dead."

Knowing Moffat, I wager that this episode will be similar to the just been Doctor Who Christmas special where everywhere is a dream; this 1895 episode of Sherlock could all be in Sherlock's head and he uses the hallucination to solve the present day crime he then awakens to at the end of the episode."

Why do you think your character does like this in that exact second in this episodes? If he did this, what would your character do?  Can you tell us about season 4?

Sherlock,33p91g,CalmDownOverThere,35,Fri Apr 24 11:35:34 2015 UTC,I think the fact that he's eccentric and comes across as asexual curbs the typical alpha-male horndog stereotype of a heterosexual male.

Sherlock,33p91g,ForestfortheDraois,22,Sat Apr 25 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"This goes back way, way before Tumblr. Spock and Kirk were a subject of slash fanfic way before there was a World Wide Web.  And people have wondered about the exact nature of Holmes' and Watson's relationship since the original ACD stories came out."
Sherlock,33p91g,InsanityIsTrueSanity,21,Fri Apr 24 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of people jump to conclusions about a person's sexual identity.  It's easy to box people into ""gay"" or ""straight"" and harder to understand that sexual identity is much more broader than that.  Frodo and Samwise are often labeled the same way, because they felt an undying devotion towards each other.  They also happened to be unattached romantically and in their prime.  Some people can't understand that you can just love a person as a friend and have that sort of love without any feelings of lust or romantic love.    Also, the rise of shipping and slash fiction in the online community only seems to be growing.  Two (previously) unattached males who lived together and hang out a lot are just primed for that type of attention.  And I agree about Sherlock.  Some people feel emotional attachments and love and sex are important in their lives.  It's probably way way down on Sherlock's list."
Sherlock,33p91g,StormTheParade,5,Fri Apr 24 14:17:12 2015 UTC,I've always assumed Sherlock was asexual.
Sherlock,33p91g,SirAlexH,5,Fri Apr 24 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"I like to think Sherlock is... Nothing. He isn't asexual, he isn't homosexual, he isn't heterosexual. I think he views love, romance, and sex from an analytical standpoint, so rather than to prefer a particular gender or sex, he would simply let himself feel what he feels and collect data thusly.  To add to this, I don't believe Sherlock is the type to leave a hypothesis or conclusion alone for too long. He must return to experiments to test their outcomes again, over time. So if he finds that he falls in love with a man once in Uni, there's no way he'd just pronounce himself homosexual and call it a day.  There was definitely some sexual interest in Irene too.  But I can see a very deep love with John, be it romantic, sexual, or solely companion-based. Sherlock shares a love with John in an incredibly intimate way; one I think many of us are lucky to experience personally more than once.  But I dunno, I may be full of crap here."
Sherlock,33p91g,taijituii,10,Fri Apr 24 19:15:25 2015 UTC,I personally don't think he's gay. I see John and Sherlock as being very close friends and a part of me actually gets annoyed that some johnlock shippers are so insistent they are gay for each other that they fail to realise that it is very much possible for two men to be friends and not have it be romantic. Hell if anything I think that's the point of the show. Moffat and Gatiss want to show it's possible for two men to be the utmost of friends without it being romantic because it's true. Why can't men be very close friends?  As for why people think they are gay? I'm not a shipper I can't tell you. Maybe they are old fashioned romantics who love 'love' stories. I mean based on the few blogs I've seen on Tumblr they seem to love Sherlock and Cumberbatch specifically. Maybe because they like Sherlock so much and John is so close to Sherlock that he is the easiest character to pair Sherlock with. John is the surrogate if you will. Of course that's a very wild sterotype. Some maybe just love the characters and imagine they are gay because they are so close. Some may be misguided. Some may just think it's cute. Depends on the person.  Now as to why some are so utterly convinced that Sherlock is a love story and that there is a massive conspiracy going around that John and Sherlock will be end game and that every upcoming episode will be the one where Sherlock kisses John (Yes there are some people that theorise every upcoming episode is the one to further the love. Hell people think because the Special is in 1895 it has to do with Oscar Wilde who was friends with Doyle and is gay and so obviously there's a connection). Why some people are so convinced of this? I don't know. That part I definitely have no explanations for.  And I might've been a bit negative against Johnlockers. Chances are if you are one and reading this I'm NOT talking about you. I'm thinking of a very specific section of Tumblr in my head (the hostile kind).  Point is: I don't think they are. And this is coming from a gay man if that also helps.

If you restrict your Google search to before 2008, you get tons of hits about the gay subtext in the books. That said, when I was reading them in HS I didn't see this at all, and don't know enough about Victorian social mores to know even if the subtext is there.

Even keeping in mind the instances described in your first link I still only see the relationship between John and Sherlock platonic and brotherly. A number of my friends, both gay and straight, also see it this way. Now, that isn't to say because some of them are gay that they know everything about every behavior expressed by other gay people, I do find it strange that I've only heard about this debate over Sherlock's sexuality online and never amongst people I've talked to about the show in person. Anyways, thanks again!"
Sherlock,33p91g,RuafaolGaiscioch,14,Fri Apr 24 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of someone whose been reading all of Holmes' stories since childhood, you're not wrong.  He's not gay, he's asexual, and the shows are quite good at capturing that."
Sherlock,33p91g,9minutes,14,Fri Apr 24 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"Generally, the perception of anonymity on the Internet is going to lead to a more ""open"" environment when it comes to these discussions. Queer people are still killed every day for being queer; it's not always safe to even have a conversation about a TV show if it is going to inadvertently out you.  I have to ask you though, you say you can identify a scene as being romantic in the context of Sherlock saving Irene, yet he shoots a man in cold blood to protect John...and that's...? What? Just guys being pals? He tells Molly, who the audience knows has a crush on him, that he doesn't like something about her appearance - so she changes it and tells him ""it wasn't working for me"", yet when the exact scene plays between John and Sherlock (re: the mustache), John's motivation is...? Would your perspectives change if John were a woman? Sherlock turns down sex from multiple, attractive women...yet can't be bothered to check his inbox or take cases because he is too busy planning John's wedding. Girlfriends aren't really his area, but he knows having a boyfriend is fine. Certainly, you can cherry pick these scenes and give individual explanations for why they do not amount to Sherlock being gay, but looking at the show as a whole and as a story, there is no universal reason to dismiss it."
Sherlock,33p91g,tayatagi,14,Fri Apr 24 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Sherlock isn't gay or straight, though.  He's asexual, and that's a part of queer, and that's ok.  If I were simply interpreting a TV show, I wouldn't be nearly as sure about my claim.  If the TV show strayed very much from the source material, I also wouldn't be very sure about my claim.  I am, however, a lifelong fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and I can tell you that Sherlock from the books is definitely asexual, and the show does an excellent job highlighting a lot of the same traits that show him as that.  Yes, he loves Watson.  That's without doubt.  It's not a romantic love, though, it's closer to a fraternal, but meant to be more than that.  Holmes, a stoic asshole, on multiple occasions in the stories come rushing to Watson's side in a frenzy of emotion at the prospect of him getting hurt, and it's always highlighted in the text when it happens.  John is the most important person to him, really the only important person to him, but that doesn't mean he has any sexual attraction to John (or anyone else).  I really don't have an agenda here.  I'm a little bit gay myself.  But the character that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created was always intended to be asexual, and Sherlock is a very accurate depiction of that character."
Sherlock,33p91g,punkist1984,4,Fri Apr 24 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Sherlock isn't gay or straight, though. He's asexual...I am, however, a lifelong fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and I can tell you that Sherlock from the books is definitely asexual,   What is your basis for this, though? Asexuality wasn’t a “thing” in the context of the original text and neither was homosexuality. If you weren’t heterosexual, you kept your mouth shut and prayed no one found out. That’s why subtext exists, and why it’s so fervently fought over. We can theorize all we want about how ACD meant for Sherlock’s sexuality to be interpreted, but seeing as though he is 1) dead, and 2) didn’t actually care about Sherlock at all, it’s ultimately just a matter of opinion.   Secondly, asexuality only deals with sexual orientation and not romantic, so even if you want to argue that Sherlock is asexual, it still does not mean that he wouldn’t have sex, or wouldn’t engage in a romantic relationship. Neither of those options make sense within the narrative so far. I am okay with being wrong about this, but I would almost bet money that Sherlock being asexual-homoromantic, or homoromantic & sex-repulsed is not what the writers are going for.  In your interpretation, what do you think Sherlock had been ""meaning to say"" on the tarmac?"
Sherlock,33p91g,punkist1984,4,Fri Apr 24 16:33:43 2015 UTC,I thought Sherlock was asexual until season 3 but now I think he's in love with John in more than a platonic way. I don't know if it's sexual or not but there are tons of signs in season 3. That's my interpretation of it anyway.
Sherlock,33p91g,teethandteeth,8,Fri Apr 24 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"Hi,  There are a lot of meta analysis pieces out there that go in to this topic, and I know some of them have been posted here, but I think the most important and most compelling ones are missing.  Here is the BBC's LGBT report showing they weren't just willing, but wanted to have more primetime gay stories.  Here's the oft-cited M-Theory. Now, this theory encompasses much more than just John and Sherlock's relationship, so read with the knowledge that there are potentially HUGE spoilers in that theory, but it does go into depth on each episode of how the subtext of the show supposedly shows the growing romantic love between John and Sherlock. Everything from frame placement, to use of mirrors, to lighting, to musical score are analyzed here.  In addition, here are meta analysis pieces in regard to the car backfiring, and the speckled blonde and the aluminum crutch.  Also, an episode by episode ""Johnlock""-only analysis is growing here that you might want to keep an eye on as it is finished throughout 2015.  If you truly, honestly want to know why some people believe what they do about the relationship between John and Sherlock, you should read each of the things I have suggested here in full. Even if you don't personally buy any of it, at least you will have seen all the information that other people have read and will be better able to come to your own conclusions."

Sherlock,33p91g,improbablesalad,2,Fri Apr 24 16:19:53 2015 UTC,"Because Tumblr has a knack for fetishizing homosexuality. I agree with you, I just can't see the Sherlock/John dynamic in anything other than a brotherly light, and I don't know why two men caring for each other a lot automatically makes them lovers.  You're free to think that way, of course, but it's the Tumblr attitude of ""This is fact, nothing but indisputable fact."" that pisses me off. And there's definitely a lot of wish-fulfillment involved."
Sherlock,33p91g,BubblyBullinidae,9,Sat Apr 25 05:30:39 2015 UTC,"Moriarty asks, ""Is that a [some kind of gun] or are you just happy to see me?"" Sherlock responds with ""Both."" Janine, who ought to know, implies twice that he's gay.  Sherlock all but confirms it both times. Attractive women are always throwing themselves at him.  He always turns them down. The editing of his deductions.  With Irene, he glances over her naked body, doesn't find anything interesting, and moves on.  But he gives John a thorough once-over, settling on his eyes and mouth, and finishes with a heartbeat sound effect.  Whenever he deduces an attractive man, the camera settles on aesthetically pleasing points, which it doesn't when he deduces other people. Constant comparisons between Sherlock and Mary in TSoT, including Sherlock throwing his flowers into the crowd, which is always a bridal thing. When people think he and John are dating, he never corrects him, despite the fact that he loves telling people they're wrong. Tons of queer coding and innuendo in TSoT (wedding planning, ""drama queen,"" ""Every good girl loves a solider,"" pirouetting)  Obviously, in real life, doing any one of these things doesn't mean you're gay, but this is clearly deliberate.  They're trying to tell us something. There's something really important that he's been meaning to tell John, and it's not ""Sherlock is actually a girl's name."" Sherlock deliberately ruins John's relationships He can tell that Moriarty's gay because there's a lot of product in his hair.  Sherlock's hair is always sopping. Everyone who knows him thinks he's gay.  Mrs. Hudson, Angelo, John, Irene, Janine, and the media, to start with. When you watch the series as a romance, there are a lot of scenes that make more sense. The unaired pilot.   And more meta-ly speaking:   If you think the ""Holmes doesn't love"" bit from A Scandal in Bohemia means BBC Sherlock is asexual, keep in mind that they address those lines with the High-Functioning Sociopath thing.  That frees them up to do whatever they want with his sexuality. The sexual ambiguity is deliberate, constant, and expensive.  It takes up a lot of the air time, and it's not even usually funny.  Do you really think the resolution is going to be ""bromance""? Those of you who say he's asexual, do you have any evidence?  That ACD Sherlock is gay isn't an uncommon reading, and all BBC Sherlock says is that girlfriends aren't his area."
Sherlock,33p91g,Stratisphear,4,Fri Apr 24 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think with Irene it was his fault she got there (she had almost won, after all), and felt he owed it to her. He outted her in the first place.  I felt that was such a heartless way to out her (I felt your pulse, acting interested and then throwing her to the wolves). I saw his relationship with her more like one of admiration, for being able to beat him for as long as she did, as many times as she did. So I guess it totally depends on how you look at it.   I see the chemistry there, and its almost like the writers want you to think they have a chance (john always firmly denying being a couple with sherlock, while sherlock never says anything to deny it. Or the funny lines ['he's gay, he puts product in his hair!' 'I put product in my hair!'] Etc. Everyone on the show sees it (granted, they are acting, but so are Ben and Martin) so it gives it a lot of creditability.  Just my two cents.   Edit- oh Yea, and Sherlock always conveniently ruining John's dates. The blind baker thing when he phones back and gets another ticket. That was hilarious. And sherlock even asked john on a date :  Sherlock: I need to get some air; we're going out tonight. John: Actually, I've got a date. Sherlock: What? John: It's when two people who like each other go out and have fun... Sherlock: That's what I was suggesting."

Sherlock,33p91g,SirAlexH,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:16:15 2015 UTC,I think its popular to automatically assume any media featuring two characters means that the two are into each other.  Oh there's a girl in this movie about a guy?  they must be in love?  Oh there are two guys living together and they are close? One of them at least must be gay!  Orange is the new black? someone is a lesbian! .. well you get the idea
Sherlock,33p91g,eeyore102,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"This happens in every fandom, not just Sherlock. And I don't think it is always particularly unjustified. LGBT people are getting more representation but are truly, terribly underrepresented in media. And some people just like the idea of two of their favorite guys in a relationship. They might not all 100% believe it is supported in canon, but they also think it is at least plausible. And I don't think that's necessarily wrong. We haven't seen Sherlock in any (real) relationships, so there's really no true info about his preferences. And no info does not / should not universally always equal straight as a default.   So that's why people like to see him as gay. They would like more LGBT representation and/or they are happy about / turned on by the idea of a gay relationship. They don't see anything that contradicts it and they would enjoy seeing that dynamic. You say below that some people are using references that you think are unintentional to justify their beliefs, but that's fine. They shouldn't even have to justify it. As I said, we know nothing about his orientation. Even as you say you think his relationship to John is brotherly, that doesn't mean a gay person can't have brotherly relationships, nor does a person who saves a woman's life have to be straight. Defaulting a character to heterosexual may be statistically accurate in real life, but when you have fiction to think about, you can think about things that you would enjoy seeing.  nb. I personally see Sherlock as asexual and don't ship him with any person. I am familiar with the mindset, however."

Sherlock,33m58y,mollyhooper,6,Thu Apr 23 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"HE DIDN'T THINK THERE'D BE A SERIES 4?   Was he ever going to inform the hordes of fans that the Series 3 cliffhanger was the end? I feel like we've all been living under an assumption that turns out not to have been necessarily true.  OK that probably sounds like a huge overreaction, and I'm not really as freaked about this as I probably sound, but really.   Also Cumbernatch."
Sherlock,33m58y,biscuitpotter,11,Thu Apr 23 19:41:10 2015 UTC,Rule 1: Moffat lies.
Sherlock,33m58y,riker89,3,Thu Apr 23 22:38:21 2015 UTC,Cumbernatch?  I like that one.
Sherlock,33m58y,Silvercelt,3,Fri Apr 24 00:33:03 2015 UTC,I think they should just wrap it up. Waiting years for a handful of episodes is getting tired. The audience is changing and their initial interest may not necessarily be sustained.

Sherlock,33m58y,eeyore102,3,Fri Apr 24 14:40:01 2015 UTC,And the quality seems to go down too
Sherlock,33m58y,unitzero13,14,Thu Apr 23 23:08:37 2015 UTC,Series 3 was the best IMO.
Sherlock,33m58y,Dannflor,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:00:04 2015 UTC,"IMO, I feel that people who haven't read the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, disliked the thid series, more so than others."

Sherlock,33m58y,Dannflor,0,Sat May 2 03:49:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. Season 3 was the worst so far.
Sherlock,33p1y5,TheCivilizedGamer,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:49:16 2015 UTC,"If you can do Netflix, it's available for instant streaming. You'd just have to pay for Netflix (which is like $8 per month for streaming-only access). You could subscribe, watch what you want, then cancel :)"
Sherlock,33p1y5,meg_arms,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:11:03 2015 UTC,Given that it's only 9 episodes total you could easily watch it within the one month free trial of Netflix or amazon prime.

Sherlock,33l41z,dragongrrl56,2,Thu Apr 23 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"The entire series is amazing, love the political stuff too"
Sherlock,33l41z,Char10tti3,1 point,Sat May 16 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've seen them from time to time. They are always very clever with an edge, but not a cruel edge so much as a shrewd edge."
Sherlock,33l41z,Char10tti3,2,Sat May 16 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"And they are always recent stories, my mum told me about Spitting Image, its quite a bit similar.  I hope it's a long running series or has a lot of series."
Sherlock,33i3n9,rover23,7,Wed Apr 22 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting. Most shows have a writing team where everybody sort of works together to come up with the story for each episode, and then one or two of them will actually write the screenplay."
Sherlock,33i3n9,morphinapg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:48:32 2015 UTC,This is how they run Doctor Who as well. There is one writer for each story. Obviously that show has more writers though.
Sherlock,33i3n9,TheKharmeleon,2,Thu Apr 23 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"That's quite common for most shows in the UK.  The producer will run the show, weaving storylines together etc, and they'll hire different writers each week to do the main story for that week.  With most sitcoms, short dramas etc, it'll be written by the one or two people that created it"
Sherlock,33i3n9,quinn_drummer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:50:49 2015 UTC,This is the norm for UK shows. Writing panels are generally a US thing.
Sherlock,33i3n9,Secret7000,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:24:53 2015 UTC,How do shows maintain an overall arc and creative vision then?
Sherlock,33i3n9,morphinapg,2,Thu Apr 23 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"By having a show runner who works with the individual writers to make sure themes and arcs are properly adhered to. For example, Neil Gaimann spoke about how he constantly emailed back and forth with S Moffatt when he wrote his Doctor Who episode ""The Doctor's Wife""."
Sherlock,33i3n9,Secret7000,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:49:40 2015 UTC,Oh okay that makes sense
Sherlock,33i3n9,morphinapg,2,Thu Apr 23 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is interesting. For a moment I thought they were working like the creators of Modern Family do, where one writes the odd numbered episodes and the other writes the even numbered episodes and don't collaborate but glad it isn't like that. I didn't know it would be a tough process to work on a script together."
Sherlock,33i3n9,ssanPD,2,Wed Apr 22 22:43:55 2015 UTC,I'm wondering how exactly this would work. Assuming Moffat is doing another Series of Doctor Who he'd have to write his script around Septemberish to October so he can get back to starting writing the new Series. Or he could possibly spare some time in say January or February at which point the scripts would have to be done for filming to start and preproduction to go ahead etc. So I'm wondering if they are planning on just writing one script together or somehow doing all three or one indivdual script each and one collaboration. Very interesting stuff indeed.
Sherlock,33i3n9,SirAlexH,2,Thu Apr 23 13:12:16 2015 UTC,"I am kind of surprised since The Sign Of Three was written by all three Sherlock writers (Gatiss, Moffat, and Thompson)."
Sherlock,33i3n9,eeyore102,6,Thu Apr 23 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"Yes but the three writers only wrote different bits together. Moffat just wrote the best man speech, Thompson wrote the stag night scenes and Gatiss wrote the crime related scenes. I think what Gatiss means here is that he and Moffat sat down in a room together, went through every single plot beat and together came up with every line of dialogue rather than going off and doing their own seperate scenes."
Sherlock,33i3n9,SirAlexH,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:29:23 2015 UTC,That means the special will either be GOD AWFUL or AMAZING or somewhere in-between.  Can't wait to see what it'll be!
Sherlock,33h83r,Clearly_a_fake_name,21,Wed Apr 22 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think Mary genuinely fell in love with John. She was trying to build a new life away from CAM. It was just lucky for her that Sherlock was around when CAM cam,e back. Or unlucky, because Sherlock was the reason CAM decided to utilize what he had on Mary."
Sherlock,33h83r,catdoctor,9,Wed Apr 22 14:58:06 2015 UTC,^ this. What helped seal it for me was the scene at Sherlock's parents where John forgives her. Her emotions there seemed very genuine.
Sherlock,33h83r,bencumberbatch,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"I genuinely believe she loves John.  But I'm also of the opinion that she only sought out John in the first place for Sherlocks help (even though he was ""dead"").  That's why they refer to her as a Client."
Sherlock,33h83r,Char10tti3,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:26:56 2015 UTC,She did fool sherlock loads so there's no absolute knowing at this point but I do think she knew she was pregnant at the meal in episode one because she refuses alcohol
Sherlock,33h83r,Forythias,3,Sat May 16 23:00:08 2015 UTC,Maybe Mycroft had something to do with it? Never thought of it this way.
Sherlock,33h83r,ThinkingViolet,12,Wed Apr 22 14:44:01 2015 UTC,That has always been the hardest pill for me to swallow about this storyline. We know Mycroft was keeping tabs on John while Sherlock was away. Did Mycroft really not know that he was nearly engaged to an assassin?
Sherlock,33h83r,polybius2,13,Wed Apr 22 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"Mary's part of Moriarty's plot, and Moriarty has Mycroft in his pocket, so Mycroft can't say anything.  Moriarty sent Mary to keep tabs on John.  And she wound up falling in fucked up love with him.  Mary's in on everything.  Look at her incongruous expressions in the restaurant.  She recognizes Sherlock right away (how could she not? he's a celebrity her boyfriend's obsessively grieving), and looks excited, not surprised.  But then she plays dumb.  Tooootally sketchy."
Sherlock,33h83r,ThinkingViolet,3,Wed Apr 22 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think this is plausible. I just don't want it to be right, mostly because I don't think John could take another betrayal. Maybe if she had to sacrifice herself to save John from Moriarty, in some kind of act of repentance?"
Sherlock,33h83r,polybius2,2,Wed Apr 22 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"I would like that.  Yeah, I like her as kind of a gray villain.  And, poor John, I don't think they're done destroying him."
Sherlock,33h83r,ThinkingViolet,2,Wed Apr 22 21:13:10 2015 UTC,"At some point you have to question whether his association with Sherlock is really good for him though. There needs to be some benefit. We got that in S1, and I think we need to see it again to make all these trials worth it."
Sherlock,33h83r,boring_story,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"I refuse to buy that he ever forgave her for shooting Sherlock in the first place, so it wouldn't be much of an added betrayal. I mean, she shot John's best friend in the heart. Sherlock died on the emergency room table (if only for an instant) and to top it off she didn't do it because she was physically in danger but because she wanted to protect her secrets from John. Yet in just few months he's throwing his doubts on the yule log and saying he's there for her 100%.  Would you forgive your wife for shooting your best friend (even in the leg) just because she wanted to hide something from you? Nah. I don't buy it at all. I'm shocked anyone would. The only reason he is sticking around is the baby."

It was probably to hide from CAM because she was surprised at getting the wedding card from him. I guess she didn't know Janine worked for him at the time and then used her to get in like Sherlock did"

Sherlock,33c8a4,samcuu,43,Tue Apr 21 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"The way Watson put it in Scarlet was that when asked to play something Sherlock was great, but when he was mindless playing it was mostly dissonant chords that corresponded with his mood"
Sherlock,33c8a4,GtrVieth,7,Tue Apr 21 14:35:24 2015 UTC,Watson put a list of Sherlock's abilities in Scarlet which includes:    |10. Plays the violin well.
Sherlock,33c8a4,chriscen,16,Wed Apr 22 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure in A Study in Scarlet, Holmes says that he's at least decent when discussing with Watson if they should live together. Watson said hearing him play would ve delightful IIRC."

Sherlock,33c8a4,bachrock37,14,Tue Apr 21 13:13:43 2015 UTC,Could be great for your technique. People speculate that Paganini must've been high and/or crazy to pull off the techniques he invented.
Sherlock,33c8a4,H-Resin,7,Tue Apr 21 14:27:02 2015 UTC,"As a musician, I have to agree with bachrock37. Being high as shit is actually really great for technique. It relaxes your muscles as well as your mind, both of which are very important for precise execution"
Sherlock,33c8a4,ChernobylKrigare,3,Tue Apr 21 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Many musicians in the top orchestras have drug reliance. Helps you keep awake and focused during long practice hours. Rehearsals are long and if you don't put in the hours of private practice, someone else could take your spot. Some drugs will certainly would bring you down and make you slower, but cocaine I think he would be on point."
Sherlock,33c8a4,jchiang,73,Tue Apr 21 22:32:38 2015 UTC,"As a violinist, watching him pretend to play violin is the low part of watching this show. It makes me cringe sometimes. But it still doesn't affect my love for the show."
Sherlock,33c8a4,7693385781711,33,Tue Apr 21 11:50:22 2015 UTC,I totally agree. In fact I find it kind of reassuring that there is at least one thing Benedict Cumberbatch can't do well.
Sherlock,33c8a4,ILikeTheCoochie,44,Tue Apr 21 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"He apparently also can't say ""penguin,"" although I think he's just fucking with us at this point."
Sherlock,33c8a4,ThinkingViolet,9,Tue Apr 21 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"He ought to just take a few basic lessons, doing that should be sufficient to make it look realistic at least.  I don't see why he doesn't do that, seems like the obvious solution.  It can't be that hard to learn how to fake playing the violin so it looks real."
Sherlock,33c8a4,jchiang,18,Tue Apr 21 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"Well, he has. Here is an article by his teacher. Apparently he is very enthusiastic about it but it just doesn't look right to anyone who knows better."
Sherlock,33c8a4,lion_queen,7,Tue Apr 21 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think that he needs a lesson, but rather he needs to hear the music so he is at least moving the bow correctly."
Sherlock,33c8a4,richindallas,2,Tue Apr 21 20:08:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. It looks like they just put in the music in postproduction and it doesn't match what he was supposed to be playing.

Sherlock,33c8a4,astrocountess,16,Wed Apr 22 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone has this issue with whatever their particular talent/hobby is. The way dogs and horses are portrayed in films drives me crazy. Dogs don't make comical 'arooo?' noises every time someone looks at them. Horses don't whinny anytime their mouths are open, especially if their mouth is only wrenched open by someone sawing away on the bit, but in a film if a horse's mouth is open, a whinny must be edited in!  And also, in any remotely touching film about horses the only thing it takes to ride a horse (even a wild one!) is the desire to do so. You can go from never having seen a horse before to riding a previously unbroke one in the Kentucky Derby without taking even one lesson."
Sherlock,33c8a4,zeeli,2,Tue Apr 21 16:17:31 2015 UTC,"with whatever their particular talent/hobby is.   So true. As a physics student, fight scenes can really be a pain to watch."

The closest I know of is a filter in Photoshop called ""cutout""; with the right settings, it looks like a low-poly image. But it won't look anything like a real 2D low poly image, because that takes the human eye's perception of depth, object separation, etc into account. Sherlock's hair looks especially nice, btw ^"

Sherlock,33073r,PepsiGeneration,3,Sat Apr 18 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the Illustrious Client would be fantastic. The Red headed league would be brilliant simply for the shot of 50,000 redheads in London. The Devils foot simply for a trippy hallucigenic sequence. And I remember Gatiss said in an interview he loved the concept in The Yellow Face where Sherlock Holmes got it wrong. So I guess that? That idea anyway. Not the whole Racial story which wouldn't fit in. Lady Frances Carfax. Thosse are the ones off the top of my head though.  And it's not ACD but I'd love to see an adaptation of Anthony Horowitz' ""A House of Silk""."

He got it wrong which is something Gatiss wanted to explore. Not necessarily the whole racial issue as again that just would not work today.

He has died/killed/come back to life for John, so obviously he is capable of feeling affection. However, by labeling himself as such, he excuses his behavior that fits outside social norms and allows it to increase. Other people treat him as a ""freak"" for it, which only serves to increase his alienation. Thus the cycle continues."

Sherlock,32k5xx,martinelind,89,Tue Apr 14 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"I think the season could revolve around Mary's death, being painted as a murder of both Mary and Baby Watson, with Moriarty being a root cause. Watson would become obsessed and Sherlock the would help John find who is responsible. But as the season draws to a close it turns out that Mary did just die a natural death, and worse Sherlock has known all along.   In a fit of rage Watson has an altercation with Sherlock, accusing him of using John all along because Sherlock needed John, because without John Sherlocks life is boring. And in the big emotional reveal it really was John who needed Sherlock and this ""game"" to cope with his trauma of losing his wife and child."
Sherlock,32k5xx,MyFaceOnFire,37,Tue Apr 14 13:42:00 2015 UTC,I think you need to write for BBC.
Sherlock,32k5xx,gemthing,9,Tue Apr 14 16:11:12 2015 UTC,Almost the plot of Memento.
Sherlock,32k5xx,BetterCalldeGaulle,4,Tue Apr 14 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting and really fun to speculate on. What if Sherlock needed John not necessarily because his life is boring otherwise, but because it was a means to be on the hunt to solve a mystery that Sherlock truly didn't know the outcome.   That is (if it's about Moriarty), he leads John into thinking Moriarty is behind the murder when knowing all along it wasn't a murder. However, there still is a tangentially related crime to solve and a distracted and mourning John is of no help to him.   Perhaps that's what you meant, but I guess I read it as Sherlock just going through the motions for John's benefit. Like he knew there was nothing to solve because it wasn't a crime, but for John's sake he did all this to distract him from his sorrows.   This way once John figures it out he gets upset not only he's being strung along (essentially against his will), but because Sherlock made him think he'd get closure to a horrible situation, and was acting selfishly (by thinking about solving a mystery) instead of being there for his friend.   But in the end, somehow, the crime Sherlock is looking into is related to something Mary was sort of looking into herself before she gave birth and died (and Sherlock knew nothing of this the whole time, and this new information changes everything in his own hunt). So while it's not something that was directly responsible for her death, it was still something that she was worried/distracted by and afraid of. And it turns out that by catching Moriarty, John is helping solve this one last stressful issue that Mary had that was leftover from her time as being a criminal herself.   Hence, John becomes reinvigorated to solve the mystery with Sherlock to help clear his wife's name and memory. And Sherlock wouldn't have been able to solve the mystery without John, proving how mutually dependent the relationship really is.   Wow... I've never been interested in fan-fiction, but this could actually be really fun to flesh-out!"

Sherlock,32k5xx,WhoaProblematic,4,Tue Apr 14 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's going to die at all, at least for a season or so. I think they'll probably be doing a ""juggling parenthood and adventure"" plotline."
Sherlock,32k5xx,GordonTheGopher,16,Tue Apr 14 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"But that will be a very John/Mary-centric plotline, and the show is about Sherlock after all.  I guess my real problem with this plot line is that i really, really want Sherlock and John back together, no baby-crap involved at all. I really miss the good old bantering that has been cut down due to Mary-John-Sherlock interaction and stylish production"
Sherlock,32k5xx,mandym347,5,Tue Apr 14 16:53:30 2015 UTC,"I can see Mary losing the baby in some adventure-related complication (somehow falling/getting hit in the stomach/etc.), but I can't see Mary dying when she was introduced so recently. It would feel like a sloppy way to tie up loose ends."
Sherlock,32k5xx,autowikibot,2,Tue Apr 14 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get your point. My only point of reference to her death is the canon. That Mary Watson played a very insignificant part, except for The Sign of Four. After that she's hardly mentioned at all. And then she dies to reboot the stories. So, if the writers are keeping with the source material (which they have stated was the purpose of the exercise; to write a modern take on the stories) Mary Watson will not be a predominant character for long and will eventually die."
Sherlock,32k5xx,CytochromeC,9,Tue Apr 14 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think Moffat doesn't want to annoy feminists any more than he already has :) I think Mary Watson is meant to be an interesting female character in a show that lacks them. Immediately fridging her (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Refrigerators) would be really annoying. And Moffat just loooooves that sort of aggressive, ballsy, sexy woman (River Song, Missy, Irene)  If they were keeping strictly to the source material, Mycroft and Moriarty would not be in it so much...."

The show does lack female input, but that might be the fault of the source material.  In regards to Mycroft and Moriarty, Mycroft is based on ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes""-version rather than the ACD, and Moriarty was given more screen time due to Andrew Scotts' performance; it was not as such a part of the plot. Thus, to a large extend they've kept in line with the canon so far, character-involvement-wise"

Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,5,Tue Apr 14 16:09:44 2015 UTC,A.1. FYI. I reread the ACD canon recently and no cause of death is ever mentioned. I think others can back me up on this. Sherlock Holmes mentions John Watson's bereavement and Mary isn't present so it is assumed that John Watson is bereaved over Mary. She could have died of pneumonia or from childbirth or she could have been run over by a beer wagon.
Sherlock,32k5xx,polybius2,6,Tue Apr 14 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, right thanks!  I think this is due to ACD nature as a notorious lazy fucker, who disregarded consistency with a passion :)"
Sherlock,32k5xx,hostess_cupcake,2,Tue Apr 14 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"She could have died of pneumonia or from childbirth or she could have been run over by a beer wagon.    True, and in the Victorian era death in childbirth was hardly rare. Not sure how the statistics compare for pneumonia but illnesses were generally harder to treat effectively back then, too."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:23:47 2015 UTC,"Pneumonia needs antibiotics, often very strong ones, and the ACD stories pre-date the discovery of penicillin. So pneumonia would frequently , though not always, have been fatal."

Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,4,Tue Apr 14 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"Mary's not going to vanish.  She's going to become a villain.  She totally works for Moriarty.  She explicitly said that if John knew what she had done, he wouldn't love her.  John kills baddies.  Which means that she can't just be a moral assassin.  And our main clue about her past is that she went ""freelance.""  It all screams ""Moriarty.""  Which means the situation is ultra dangerous and ultra.  John is married to someone who's name he doesn't know.  She killed Sherlock, and we don't really know why.  (Sherlock's explanation is bullshit.)  And the baby is a reason to not just kill her or dump her or go into hiding.  John has to rescue his kid.  But we can't really have a perma-baby, so it'll turn out that she miscarried John's kid in the stress surrounding Magnussen, and had to steal someone else's to keep John.  So Baby ""Watson"" will go back to her bio-parents, because John never really wanted to be a dad anyway."
Sherlock,32k5xx,eeyore102,3,Fri Apr 17 06:18:44 2015 UTC,"I like your ideas. I've had a different scenario rolling around my head for the last while: the baby dies and Mary leaves. Perhaps the baby is still born, has a birth defect, dies of a sudden illness, or something else. (This is the 21st century but it still happens.) Due to the trauma and grief, John and Mary's relationship falls apart and Mary leaves to start over with a new identity. That way, Mary and baby are out of the picture, John and Sherlock have reason to lean on one another again, and there are no crazy action-adventure hijinks."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,3,Tue Apr 14 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"It's a long shot, but I keep coming back to the idea of Mary going to prison. It would be a curve ball to people who are so sure she is going to die, and she kind of foreshadowed it by mentioning prison herself in His Last Vow. As far as how well that would sit with the audience, it really depends on how done she is with her criminal life, and that's a matter for another episode."
Sherlock,32k5xx,tyhiggz,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"Oh thanks! Hmm, yeah, that's kind of down my line of thinking as well.  As #PepsiGeneration pointed out, Watson's 'bereavement' is mentioned in the Empty Hearse. I don't think Mofatiss will miss out on the opportunity to kill off Mary though, there's too much plot and story that can spurr from the event to miss it."
Sherlock,32k5xx,chrisnata,2,Tue Apr 14 16:36:24 2015 UTC,I agree! The writers are already hinted to a darker season and Mary's death seems like the perfect heart wrenching event that would fit the bill. Plus she dies in canon as you mentioned. I think she will die in the first episode in childbirth.
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,4,Tue Apr 14 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"That would actually be a really convenient way of taking care of the ""Mary problem"".  Bit lazy, but certainly the easy way out."
Sherlock,32k5xx,eeyore102,3,Tue Apr 14 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"Well, that properly depends on matter of perspective or something ...  For me, at least, having Mary + baby murdered would add too much drama to what is already set; the possible return of Moriarty, and the 'ghosts and consequences'-theme that has been put forth by Mofatiss.   Moffat said Series 4 will be about the consequences of Sherlocks lifestyle, and those repercussions seems extensive enough without some elaborate plot/dramatics to kill Mary. But, that's just like ... my opinion, man"
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,4,Tue Apr 14 16:50:15 2015 UTC,What if its something as simple as someone tries to kill Sherlock and accidentally kills Mary instead. That would be a repercussion of Sherlocks life (that man does make a lot of enemies) so it would fit with the theme and would not necessarily be an elaborate murder plot. Though this show is brimful of elaborate murder plots already anyway so one more wouldn't really hurt plus it would be in keeping with the previous seasons and there elaborate plots.
Sherlock,32k5xx,eeyore102,3,Tue Apr 14 17:40:07 2015 UTC,Well Mary had so many enemies in her former life. CAM emphasizes the point. So there are people who would kill her if they could find her because of her former life doing free lance hit jobs.
Sherlock,32k5xx,flashbang10,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, I like that one. Simple, yet full of dangers.  (Sometimes I wonder if the writers skim through discussion boards like these when they're in dire need of inspiration ;p )"
Sherlock,32k5xx,chrisnata,2,Tue Apr 14 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"Just because Magnussen is gone, doesn't mean the pressure points have changed.  Mary is still John's pressure point, and John is still Sherlock's. It's possible someone else could go after Mary in order to get to Sherlock."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,2,Wed Apr 15 15:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yes! If CAM could gather this information someone else could. Also, someone else could go after Mary because of some assassination she did in the past. Also, in the tarmac scene, she seemed afraid when she heard that Moriarty might be back, so maybe she crossed Moriarty in the past. She and the baby are so vulnerable in so many ways and have been all along and John had no idea until it all came out."
Sherlock,32k5xx,Horntailflames,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"Moffat is more of a take the absolutely impossible way out kind of guy, even if it contradicts prior plot."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,3,Mon Apr 20 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"I don't want her to dieeeee, Amanda is awesome and I don't want her to leave the show, noooooo.... I might be kinda in denial..."
Sherlock,32k5xx,Lemurlemurlemur,5,Tue Apr 14 16:00:51 2015 UTC,I really enjoy Amanda Abbington's portrayal too. I am also happy for Amanda in that her character's departure will probably be very spectacular and badass. Actors love that.
Sherlock,32k5xx,KnightRider1987,4,Tue Apr 14 17:19:39 2015 UTC,but Martin will have to act out the death of his wife :(   I'm not ready for this.
Sherlock,32k5xx,Lemurlemurlemur,5,Wed Apr 15 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"If it's any help, Amanda is ready for this. It's a quote from a while back and I don't remember it word for word, but Amanda said that when she took the part she told the writers she wanted to die in Martin's arms. I think there's a pretty good chance she will get her wish."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,3,Wed Apr 15 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Oh god you're going to make me cry at work. T.T
Sherlock,32k5xx,svmk1987,2,Wed Apr 15 15:37:18 2015 UTC,"...I feel sort of awful saying this, but now I seriously need to see Martin and Amanda doing this type of scene together. It would be stunning."
Sherlock,32k5xx,catdoctor,5,Fri Apr 17 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"She deserves it! She was at the Olivier Awards in London this sunday and even though she wasn't allowed to stop and give autographs she took her time to explain it via sign language to us as she was ""dragged"" along, and she blew us kisses and drew a heart with her hands for us... I'm a bit crazy about her, but she's just sooo sweet and I just love the way she portrays Mary! I'm all for Johnlock, but with Mary/John I'll actually be ok! So they can't take that away :o"
Sherlock,32k5xx,KnightRider1987,3,Tue Apr 14 17:54:56 2015 UTC,I like Amanda's portrayal too... she just kinda ... fits into the whole scenario in my opinion.
Sherlock,32k5xx,KnightRider1987,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"It could be argued that she was willing to shoot Magnusen in order to stay close to John, but., to me at least, it the act seemed more like one of desperation, shooting a man on his knees in his own office, than a calculated murder.   Pardon me for picking on you but this reads so funny to me. In this situation, I would think that the person on their knees would be in a desperate state rather than the person holding the gun. But really who knows. That scene was so confusing it could have been anything."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:52:41 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they won't do this for season four. Seems too early for a character to dies after being the semi-protagonist for S3. But season 5 maybe
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,2,Tue Apr 14 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think when Mary was introduced in The Empty Hearse, the writers knew she was going to be short term. The writers knew about her assassin past even if we didn't. They probably had a 4-5 episode storyline planned for her right from the start of season 3."
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:57:00 2015 UTC,I agree that Mary and the child have got to go to get John back to Baker Street...but I can't think of any way it could happen that won't completely destroy John!
Sherlock,32k5xx,PepsiGeneration,2,Tue Apr 14 20:28:55 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not his?
Sherlock,32k5xx,Poperama,3,Wed Apr 15 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, a possibility...but like the OP said above, I'm not sure John can cope with any more betrayal. Perhaps they'll do a Conan Doyle and series 4 will start with no Mary, no baby and no explanation!"
Sherlock,32k5xx,eeyore102,2,Wed Apr 15 06:45:50 2015 UTC,Options for John (writers will pick one or more): * Death of Mary and/or baby. * Betrayal by Mary who cheats and/or returns to her criminal life. * Life in the suburbs with Mary and baby.  The first 2 would be devastating for John and the third seems to be killing him by inches and wouldn't be good for the show.
Sherlock,32k5xx,CytochromeC,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"The real question is.. Even if you have an opinion about this, will you even remember it by the time the next season airs, which is like 2 years atleast.."
Sherlock,32e6ec,badgerisanancy,154,Mon Apr 13 01:31:23 2015 UTC,I don't know if this is supposed to be good news but I'm pretty disappointed. I was sort of expecting it to be released early next year
Sherlock,32e6ec,mannsimr,78,Mon Apr 13 01:57:27 2015 UTC,"Same.  Really disappointed.  I honestly worry that they're maybe going to wait so long that the series will lose steam and S4 actually won't get that much attention, and then they'll blame people other than those responsible (themselves, for taking so long to get it out) by saying ""well...I guess there's just not enough demand for it anymore"" and cancel it with that as the reason.  It'll be their own fucking fault, too, if that happens.  I really think they're losing a lot of recently acquired fans because of this massive delay.  By ""recently acquired"" I mean those who joined in during or after S2 came out.  Yeah, the hardcore ones will watch it even if it takes 10 years to come out, but they're the distinct minority, them alone just isn't enough I don't think."
Sherlock,32e6ec,ILikeTheCoochie,18,Mon Apr 13 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"Considering that I am talking on a sherlock subreddit I can't really talk from the perspective of ""an average viewer"" so I'm not sure how their minds would operate. But surely even if they aren't paying attention to the day by day actions of the show, once it's filmed and close to airdate the BBC will ramp up the advertisements, everything will be Sherlock Sherlock sherlock.  So wouldn't these people then just watch this show. If they watched three series they obviously like it enough that they want more and once they know it exists they'll probably catch it. And fact is it's a huge moneymaker for the BBC so I can't imagine they'll cancel it anytime soon.   If you look at the series 3 ratings they pretty much stayed consistent the whole way and that was after a two year wait. Now possibly the cliffhanger had something to do with that as well so assuming there is a cliffhanger at the end of the special...well who knows. And on the other hand ""Many Happy Returns"" has 7 million views just on the BBC's youtube page alone, not counting the duplicates and iPlayer etc. A seven minute video brought in 7 million views of what the majority would be the more hardcore fans (assumably here) so why wouldn't three movie length episodes bring in just as many people, including hardcore fans and casual viewers alike? Point is I wouldn't be worried too much. Probably.   Again I'm not a casual viewer though. I'm intense. I'll watch anything."
Sherlock,32e6ec,hourglasspilgrim,2,Mon Apr 13 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"As an ""average viewer""who came in at season 2, I think this will be fine. Wouldn't worry too much."
Sherlock,32e6ec,awayshewent,5,Mon Apr 13 11:42:12 2015 UTC,"The way I view waiting for seasons of Sherlock is that it's more like waiting for the next installment of a movie series than an entire season of a TV show, and people regularly wait several years for movies. I don't think another TV show show could get away with the long hiatuses, but because of the quality of the production and the fact that it doesn't take much commitment to watch an entire season, I think they get away with it."
Sherlock,32e6ec,dibblah,6,Mon Apr 13 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I think the trouble with long waits between series, whether it is tv (like this and doctor who) or books (think asoiaf or Kingkiller chronicles) is that so many fans have all this time to come up with great ideas of how the next installment could be. Every idea gets floated about on places like this, everything is imagined, and ultimately when it comes out, it can't live up to itself.  We saw it with season 3 - how many people had come up with awesome ideas for what happened...and then when it came out...so many people didn't really like it.   When there is such a huge gap, you get two groups of people...one which just forgets about it until the ads start up next time...and the other which ends up on places like this discussing theories etc. And those who stay to discuss theories often end up disappointed because the real show can't live up to what they've made it to be."
Sherlock,32e6ec,eeyore102,3,Mon Apr 13 19:24:19 2015 UTC,and that's why I love fanfic.
Sherlock,32e6ec,morphinapg,10,Tue Apr 14 13:48:21 2015 UTC,We'll still get the Christmas special
Sherlock,32e6ec,zutroy,7,Mon Apr 13 08:33:22 2015 UTC,I definitely wasn't trying to present it as good news. Not really good news...no no. I mean we can look on the bright side....there'll be another episode before the end of the year. And it's Victorian which I know not everyone is down with but I think will be Freaking awesome! And based on how long episodes take to film and edit it may be possible that they'd air around July August sometime which isn't as bad as January 2017. Not good but not as bad as it theoretically could be.................eh.
Sherlock,32e6ec,hivaidsislethal,4,Mon Apr 13 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with it. Part of what makes Sherlock special to me is the gaps between seasons. Lots of other shows ram advertising and junk episodes down your throat by releasing 22 episodes every 6 months.  Sherlock is different, and that's a good thing. I know that the wait will be worth it. They haven't disappointed me yet."
Sherlock,32e6ec,zutroy,5,Mon Apr 13 11:00:41 2015 UTC,but potentially 3 years for only 3 more episodes is definitely too much time in between.
Sherlock,32e6ec,_pirate_lawyer,2,Mon Apr 13 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"I find myself almost irrationally patient for Sherlock. I can't explain it. But yes, 3 years is a bit excessive between seasons."

A lot of times scheduling conflicts and stuff like that are just too much for a show so they do stuff like cut characters (ahem, Community) or just end entirely. It's cool to see that, despite their busy schedules, they're still committed to keeping the show going."
Sherlock,32e6ec,Kayleemarie1994,5,Mon Apr 13 03:11:49 2015 UTC,You have cheered me up.
Sherlock,32e6ec,GetFreeCash,24,Mon Apr 13 03:19:45 2015 UTC,Early next year?! Why does it take them so long to get them out? :((
Sherlock,32e6ec,Kayleemarie1994,51,Mon Apr 13 02:04:54 2015 UTC,I assume because Cumberbatch and Freeman are now highly in-demand actors and scheduling everyone is a nightmare?
Sherlock,32e6ec,JacobtheeGod,6,Mon Apr 13 02:06:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough

Sherlock,32e6ec,Waywoah,-4,Mon Apr 13 20:19:08 2015 UTC,I kinda prefer to think they're taking their time to get the script right after Series 3 was so lackluster. Could be either I guess
Sherlock,32e6ec,7693385781711,14,Mon Apr 13 02:20:36 2015 UTC,What was wrong with series three?

But if we wait 2 years for an explanation for the fake suicide, which we didn't get, and then there's that wedding episode(which was kinda meh in my opinion) Series three didn't meet the expectations.

Sherlock,32e6ec,SirAlexH,10,Mon Apr 13 13:59:30 2015 UTC,Series 3 was my favourite series of them all actually.

Sherlock,32e6ec,SirAlexH,14,Mon Apr 13 18:48:43 2015 UTC,Chief reason why it isn't filmed this year is Dr Strange.  Billion dollar company beats public funded show unfortunately.
Sherlock,32e6ec,IxionS3,6,Mon Apr 13 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, can't be too sad about that. Dr Strange sounds like it's gonna be awesome! I think any given Marvel movie has a bigger audience than Sherlock so it makes sense to prioritize that."
Sherlock,32e6ec,swizzcheez,2,Mon Apr 13 02:53:55 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely it is logical. In general I'm more of a tv fan than movie but obviously movies have a much bigger audience.
Sherlock,32e6ec,PepsiGeneration,3,Mon Apr 13 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"One way or another it's a side project for all the major players.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are major stars, Moffat has his ""day job"" on Dr Who, and Gattiss has a wider acting and writing career.  Finding places where all those conflicting schedules overlap is tough; if the principles weren't apparently in love with the show they'd probably have given up by now."
Sherlock,32e6ec,ToWhenTFor,10,Mon Apr 13 14:12:21 2015 UTC,Maybe they should film S5 too while they're available.
Sherlock,32e6ec,pathslog,6,Mon Apr 13 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"It sounds like suddenly they are confident about the timeframe. That may mean they have commitments. If this means the principles are now committed to a schedule for S4, that's good news."

Sherlock,32e6ec,peachiewonder,2,Tue Apr 14 12:36:53 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this conflict with his Doctor Strange filming if it starts in November? Or does early next year mean March or April?

I thought we might not get another season for another couple years. These gaps are normal. The actors' have crazy schedules, and this is a pet project out of passion. It's relieving that we are getting any more episodes at all, because in most usual circumstances this show never would have past by 2 or 3 seasons due to the people involved simply moving on. Instead, they have definitive plans to keep making more. That is awesome."

Sherlock,32e6ec,qbak,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"Less of waiting for a TV series, more like waiting for a series of short(-er) movies. Each episode of Sherlock is the length of a feature film. Plus, Cumberbatch and Freeman are ridiculously busy now- especially since Cumberbatch has joined the MCU.   So- cheated? Some fans of films have to wait longer than that for a single film. Take, for a random example- the Avengers sequel is coming out 2015, three years after the first one. It takes time to schedule up all the actors, write, film, etc. It doesn't just happen by magic, you know!  If you want to go mope and whine, fine. Have fun with that."
Sherlock,32e6ec,GamePhysics,0,Mon Apr 13 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"I know it takes time. But it doesn't take that much time. Lots of shows produce more content in shorter time, even of high quality."
Sherlock,32e6ec,kimwim42,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Said shows probably don't have massively popular/busy actors like Cumberbatch and Freeman.  Look, I know it's frustrating to have to wait so long, but be glad we're at least getting a fourth series."
Sherlock,32e6ec,GamePhysics,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:14:26 2015 UTC,I'd prefer them to take a few years and make high quality episodes with a good storyline than to have them rush it and release sub par episodes yearly. It is annoying to wait 3 years though.

Sherlock,32a7tg,jenroberts,2,Sun Apr 12 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"The terrible thing is that I had the gif from the ""Did you know Jason Statham was in a 90s music video"" post open at the same time as this...and they match up TOO WELL.   Look for yourself, but consider yourself warned."

Sherlock,32a7tg,vishnu2pc,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:37:33 2015 UTC,"There was no bass drop or change in timing to the song, and it didn't quite feel like dubstep. I would dub this (pun not intended, but I'll let it slide) electronica rather than dubstep."
Sherlock,323o2l,Sherlock_0fucksgiven,26,Fri Apr 10 09:02:58 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it two years between seasons before they all got famous? I think it's also that Mofftiss does Dr. Who and a lot of other things themselves. They say they can't get the show together any sooner. I believe them. I'm glad they do it at all.   Besides, this time it's 4. Last season it was 6 (3 of them were behind the scenes specials). They seem to be trying."
Sherlock,323o2l,dragongrrl56,10,Fri Apr 10 12:20:03 2015 UTC,Wait WHAT? BEHIND THE SCENES SPECIALS??
Sherlock,323o2l,Zoranius,8,Fri Apr 10 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"They're called ""Unlocking Sherlock"" -- they're on Netflix."
Sherlock,323o2l,coldstar,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are called The Return meaning Sherlock coming back from the dead. The Villains where they discuss the bad guys mostly Moriarty of course. And The Women where they talk about Molly Irene and Mrs. Hudson. They were all interesting. If you have Netflix and you go to season three you'll see them they're listed there. Otherwise I'm not sure where you would look for them. There's also another behind-the-scenes special that's kind of a making of Sherlock I can't remember the name of it I'll have to look it up."

Sherlock,323o2l,dragongrrl56,68,Fri Apr 10 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"They've booked two of the most popular actors of the decade to be apart of a show that isn't really for payment; but for challenge. The schedules of Cumberbumbum and Bilbo are so (were so most definitely) crazy occupied with other projects, it hardly leaves any room for Sherlock. They didn't even get around to shooting the special until about a few weeks ago."

Moffett is in the process of making the next season of Doctor Who, and Gatiss was writer on at least one episode last season, and will probably do the same for this one.

Sherlock,323o2l,the_long_way_round25,15,Sun Apr 19 00:02:19 2015 UTC,"GoT, made by HBO, a private enterprise with private funding. It's aim may well be to make awesome TV, but it's to make a profit off those shows too.   Sherlock, made by BBC, funded by the public (anyone in the UK who has a TV pays the TV licence, the majority of which goes to the BBC). Their aim is also to make great TV, but not necessarily to make profit, it's a public institution. The BBC can't just throw money at the problem.  FYI, Cumberbatch kinda got his big break on BBC radio in the comedy Cabin Pressure"
Sherlock,323o2l,trystanrice,7,Fri Apr 10 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Cabin Pressure was his big break...he got a lot of attention from Hawking in 2004, then kept in smaller roles in things like Atonement and Amazing Grace. IIRC, Atonement was the reason Moffat was interested in Cumberbatch."
Sherlock,323o2l,bencumberbatch,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"Fair point, although it was my first exposure to him and I do love that show"
Sherlock,323o2l,trystanrice,5,Fri Apr 10 16:35:35 2015 UTC,Sherlock was his big break. Sherlock bought him to more people than anything else he's done. Most people didn't like him in Atonement because he played such an odious character. And Cabin Pressure isn't known in the United States or China where they are huge fans of Sherlock.
Sherlock,323o2l,dragongrrl56,3,Fri Apr 10 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"On an international stage, nobody's doubting that Sherlock is what really made a splash."
Sherlock,323o2l,trystanrice,7,Fri Apr 10 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"The whole thing was a vanity project to begin with. Gatiss and Moffat were working on Doctor Who together and dreaming this stuff up on the the train, until Moffat's wife told him he'd better do the show or someone else would. They expected a small audience and, they hoped, slight critical acclaim. After it became such a huge hit in the first season, they decide they wanted to keep the quality up so, instead of doing a long season, they would keep to a short season with high production values. Plus, Moffat and Gattis are both very busy; the former on Doctor Who and the latter writing for Doctor Who and acting on stage. Combine that with the mega fame that both Cumberbatch and Freeman have achieved since the show first aired and you have a scheduling nightmare. Given how much else everyone involved is trying to achieve, and how dedicated they all are to keeping up the quality, I think we should all be thrilled that we get 3 episodes every 2 years. It's like getting 3 movies every 2 years. If this were any other movie franchise like, say, the James Bond franchise, you'd only get one movie every 2-3 years. This is better."
Sherlock,323o2l,catdoctor,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"Although the high production values was one of the reasons, the main one was Moffat just wasn't physically (and mentally) able to cope with both shows at once. His full time job is being showrunner and head writer on Doctor Who which is a very demanding project on its own. Sherlock, was and still is, his little pet project on the side. In fact some disgruntled DW fans were complaining that him splitting time between the 2 projects was causing DW's quality to suffer. It's of course now a moot point since the 2 main actors have become so famous and in-demand.  Also, the 3 episodes per series wasn't in the original plan. They wanted to do 6 one-hour episodes. After seeing the original 60 min. pilot, someone at the BBC ( to whom I'm forever grateful ) suggested changing it to 90 mins. and cutting the no. of episodes in half. Brilliant move as you can see the difference it makes when watching both pilots."

Sherlock,323o2l,Eleanor1984,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"Moffat has also mentioned early on that they're treating it as long-term experiment/project. One of the reasons for choosing young actors in the beginning was to explore the relationship between the 2 main protagonists as they grew older. We will literally get to watch Holmes and Watson age with the actors. Unlike Boyhood, we don't have to wait 12 but only 2-3 years in between takes for the next 20 years hopefully?"
Sherlock,320mx4,bencumberbatch,29,Thu Apr 9 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"John and Sherlock’s relationship is the key focal point of the show. John and Sherlock’s relationship is the key focal point of the show. John and Sherlock’s relationship is literally the entirety of the show, it’s the whole thing.  Shipping John and Sherlock and believing the plot is inevitably leading to them being together in a romantic sense are not mutually exclusive positions. We’re in an off season. The amount times we can discuss how Sherlock survived the fall or if Morarity is really alive is astounding, really, but to expect that no one engage in discussion about the future of John and Sherlock’s relationship is completely unrealistic.   Yes, the shitposts need to be removed and memes about Johnlock probably regulated to their own sub. The problem is that this entire sub is full of self-absorbed assclowns who can not tell the difference between an engaging discussion and said shitposts, because they’re so far absorbed in their own straight-washed/heteronormative views of Sherlock Holmes’ character, refuse to hear any actual and legitimate arguments otherwise.   And /u/bencumberbatch, this isn’t directed at you specifically, what you’re asking is valid and understandable. You don’t have to like the pairing or engage in the tumblr community; no one is forcing you to. We claim it’s “canon” is jokingly, I promise you that most of us are educated enough to know what is and isn’t canon."
Sherlock,320mx4,9minutes,0,Thu Apr 9 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Oh believe me, I know that most people who ship Johnlock are totally reasonable, like you said. But maybe I've just run into the wrong people on Tumblr, but I've seen plenty of metas, for example, with a lengthy in-depth look at their relationship, and every single moment and line is analyzed to be subtext, and then anyone who tries to ask/argue/question otherwise gets shot down. Hell, I got a message there not long ago accusing me of being homophobic because I don't ship them. And obviously I'm not accusing all Johnlockers of being that way, far from it. But at least on Tumblr I can block/blacklist the militant, rude people. Here, it's not so easy.   And a lot of people I follow believe (whether jokingly or not) in TJLC--The Johnlock Consipiracy, or the idea that the end goal of the show is and has always been that Sherlock and John would end up together in a romantic and sexual relationship. Some people I can tell are joking, but some seem incredibly serious about it.  So yeah, it does depend on who one follows. And again, I think discussion here is great! But it's those memes and such that are annoying.   All in all I agree with you. And the heteronormative view is present, it's too bad more people aren't open for discussion. Again, that is all awesome to talk about. But when there's a meme with a hedgehog that says ""I did not have sexual relations with that otter""...yeah, no.   Sorry for the giant wall of text."
Sherlock,320mx4,potterarchy,11,Thu Apr 9 22:16:41 2015 UTC,"maybe I've just run into the wrong people on Tumblr   That is totally possible. Tumblr has a very aggressive underbelly. Don't let it color your view of the whole fandom.    Hell, I got a message there not long ago accusing me of being homophobic because I don't ship them.   ^ Especially these people. I don't know what's up their ass, but I avoid them like the plague."
Sherlock,320mx4,9minutes,7,Thu Apr 9 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Wall of text is fine, no worries.  Sherlock is such a different beast than other tumblr-popular fandoms, and you’re bringing up TJLC, so I want to talk about that a little as well. People who are not involved in tumblr are really, really, really, really eager to shoot things like TJLC down. You see the same words repeated over and over again, that it’s just straight teenage girls wanting to seen men have sex, that it’s a delusion, it’s unfaithful to the original stories, etc ect. However, Sherlock took an amazingly interesting turn in S3, and for the first time, a theory like TJLC is no longer out of left field. The reason so many of us are defensive is because we are almost always the parties expected to take the high road, to simply accept that our pairings and ships are there for laughs, and that in lieu of representation and deep, thoughtful stories about queer people we should just accept our regular dose of queerbaiting and be happy about it. We aren’t worth telling stories about, let alone taking a hugely visible and popular role model and doing something with him that hasn’t been done before.   I believe in TJLC with my whole heart, I really do. And I’m eager to defend it, not just because of the overwhelming and staggering amount of information that points to it, but because so many people are seriously THAT butthurt that Sherlock might be gay and that John might be bi that it brings me joy to tear them down."
Sherlock,320mx4,ligirl,3,Thu Apr 9 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it totally depends on your perspective, what tumblr blogs and other communities you follow, and the like. I agree there's a huge lack of LGBT ships and representation, and too much erasure.  The amount of times I've seen accusations of homophobia, the tweets I've seen that were sent to Amanda Abbington wishing harm and death on her, the amount of hate for Mary because she gets in the way of Johnlock/isn't good for John, when Sherlock is a huge dick to John sometimes...that's what a lot of people I know/follow are upset about.   I personally don't quite know how I feel about Sherlock's sexuality, I'm still trying to decide. Season 3 especially sent me into a tailspin of what I thought.  I don't think he's straight, but I don't think he's gay either. So I'm definitely not ""butthurt"" that Sherlock might not be straight. Now, John I'm pretty sure is straight, though I feel like there's a history with him and Major Sholto, his previous--er, ex--commander."
Sherlock,320mx4,ligirl,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"This is off topic, and almost veering into exactly what /u/bencumberbatch is arguing against, but could you explain TJLC some more? This is the first I've ever heard of it. I'm a huge Johnlock shipper when it comes to fanfiction, but I'm generally of the opinion that I don't want it in the show, and I've never heard any theory before that indicates it's likely to appear in the show."
Sherlock,320mx4,ligirl,3,Fri Apr 10 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"I know you weren't asking me (9minutes will know a lot more than me) but the user wsswatson on Tumblr has a lot of in depth metas on the subject.

I hadn't seen that article before, but it does a good job of summarizing a lot of the more popular meta analysis.  However, one thing that I don't see mentioned is how far outside of the shows narrative this theory extends. Things like, the BBC commissioned report from 2009 about better LGB representation in their television series, how what scenes Moffatt has written tells us about his authorial intentions and how Moffat and Gatiss would have to be on the same page as writers to work on this project together...there is a lot that exists outside of what we see on screen that also points that this is intentional, it's been their plan since day one, and they will follow through with it by the end of the series."

Edit: #13 is a stretch  Edit 2: Finished reading it, and while I'm not fully converted, I'll just say that I'm no longer confident that we will never see Johnlock on the show, and for the first time ever, I can see how it might work. Thanks a lot!"
Sherlock,320mx4,eeyore102,7,Fri Apr 10 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"This isn't a particularly active sub; I don't think we should get in the habit of discouraging posts, especially in the long off-season when there's not new content to dissect. Sounds mostly like you need to follow some different people on Tumblr."
Sherlock,320mx4,potterarchy,7,Thu Apr 9 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. I totally agree with this, especially since I don't ship any of the main Sherlock ships (I consider myself a John/Sherlock 'friend'-ship-person because I love their relationship but I don't think it has to be sexual, like 'Johnlock' suggests). I hate it when people are like, ""You don't ship Johnlock?!?! gasp NOT A REAL SHERLOCK FAN"". No that is not the reason why I watch Sherlock, I love the relationships a lot but I think shipping and going ""MY SHIP IS RIGHT AND MY SHIP ONLY""/shipping wars in general don't belong here (a serious Sherlock discussion forum).  Plus, it's annoying as hell."
Sherlock,320mx4,potterarchy,5,Fri Apr 10 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"The ambiguity and subtext is a thing of beauty, as carefully cultivated in its artificial naturalness as bonsai, and that is why it will remain ambiguously-subtexty to the end.  We will never provably know what Sherlock's sexuality-if-any is, or whether John is bi, and Sherlock and John will always be a shining example of love, a word that in English is so overloaded that it makes the worst sins of object oriented programming look transparent as glass."
Sherlock,320mx4,LiamIsMailBackwards,5,Fri Apr 10 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see a relationship happening between them and that's fine, but I do adore every scene with Sherlock and Molly in it, especially in the last two seasons."
Sherlock,320mx4,foolofathestral,8,Fri Apr 10 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"What about meta though? There is a LOT of subtext in this show that could point toward a possible John/Sherlock pairing. It's been a subject of hot debate since the original stories were printed, shouldn't discussion of this type be allowable?"
Sherlock,320mx4,PepsiGeneration,4,Thu Apr 9 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel a lot of metas are fine, as long as a) they're observations, not a sort of ""here's why I'm right, and you all are wrong"", as I've seen in some metas, and b) They're allowed for all sides and opinions (because a lot of people don't see that subtext as subtext. It's one of those things where people who are looking for it will see it, people who aren't won't).  Though I feel with metas, they're often shot down by the opposing side, and it just leads to bickering and rudeness. Maybe Tumblr is more appropriate for that sort of thing. I don't do a whole lot of metas on there but it does feel like the more suitable environment."
Sherlock,320mx4,polybius2,6,Thu Apr 9 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"it just leads to bickering and rudeness.    Eh, I feel like that's a part of any community, though. You get people together, someone's gonna have a different opinion, and sometimes that leads to bickering. I think having the original-stories-fans (non-""Tumblr""-fans? I don't know what to call that group) with the ""Tumblr""-fans creates good diversity. We're all here to talk about how much we love the show, right? Doesn't matter how we show it, really. And homogeneity doesn't tend to lead to any interesting discussion anyway, IMO."
Sherlock,320mx4,LiamIsMailBackwards,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"I guess I meant bickering more in the sense of ""you're not a true fan if you don't ship them"" type of talk. Discussion and different opinions is totally cool, it's just when people decide to be a dick about their opinions."
Sherlock,320mx4,eeyore102,3,Thu Apr 9 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"No, totally. And I didn't mean to make it sound like I approve of that. Just that it's sometimes unavoidable when people rub shoulders. Good sub rules and moderators tend to help with that issue, though. :)"
Sherlock,320mx4,polybius2,3,Thu Apr 9 20:56:37 2015 UTC,I don't see how it can get more clearcut than this.
Sherlock,320mx4,TheJoshider10,7,Thu Apr 9 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, it is fine not to believe that Johnlock is endgame, but this is a horrible example. The response to him saying ""I'm not gay"" is a lesbian character volleying back, ""well I am and I still want him, and look at us both with sexual desire for a person who we shouldn't be attracted to.""  Irene's whole thing is that she knows what people like sexually. When John says ""we're not a couple"" and she says ""yes you are,"" it means something. That whole scene is about expansive, non-binary sexualities."
Sherlock,320mx4,ligirl,7,Fri Apr 10 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"I've heard arguments that he doesn't say he's straight, he just says he's not gay. So that leaves room for him to be bi/make an exception for Sherlock. I agree with you, and personally I think people who see that subtext are grasping for straws. But there's a lot in the show left intentionally ambiguous to make everyone happy."
Sherlock,320mx4,polybius2,3,Thu Apr 9 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"If they are trying to make everyone happy, it's at a cost. By skirting the line between friendship story and romance, they lose, for one thing, the chance to depict a Granada style secure friendship.   Instead the friendship comes off as insecure with misunderstandings, obstacles, sometimes anger, sometimes sadness, and sometimes poor treatment of each other. And the dramatic devices that the writers throw at them just keep escalating season after season.   This does seem like a strategy to make everyone happy in a way. The friendship fans are happy because it never gets to the romantic part. There is a line that the writers are clearly not crossing and that gives the friendship fans a certain level of confidence. And the romance fans are happy because the pattern of obstacles looks like the pattern of obstacles for every romantic movie combined. So to the romance fans there is an illusion of progress towards a happy romantic ending.  But meanwhile our two favorite characters have to put up with less trust, less camaraderie, less comfort, less domesticity, all in the name of ambiguity. This is getting pretty far from the original.  And this is also why I don't think anyone has to worry about a romance ruining the friendship. The friendship, in this adaptation, is already strained and in need of repair. Perhaps the repair will come in the form of a romantic endgame or perhaps the repair will come in the form of some other character development. Or perhaps the strain will just escalate and everyone will be happy."
Sherlock,320mx4,polybius2,2,Sat Apr 11 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"If you think they'd intentionally make it ambiguous, why are you sure they wouldn't go through with it?"
Sherlock,320mx4,HImainland,3,Fri Apr 10 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"Tbh I'm not so sure it won't. At the current stage in the show, it's anyone's guess really.  And they would make it intentionally ambiguous to, again, keep everyone happy. They know how prevalent Johnlock is, and if they keep people guessing and watching, it generates more sales, more interest, more people watching. What we'll have to see is if, at the end of the show, they were queer bating or if Johnlock really is endgame."

I know how to find prostates.  But why would we confirm that on camera???"" ""The newspapers think we're fucking? No lingering conflict here!""

Sherlock,320mx4,LaughsEvilly,-6,Fri Apr 10 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"What's even the point of silly tumblr pairings like 'Johnlock'. It should just be discussed there.  It's not something like shipping Molly where we know she likes him so there's reasons to discuss it a bit. But Sherlock and John? Lastrade and Mycroft??? Jesus, just go back to tumblr.   The sub should be for discussion on any episode, speculation, and events and relationships within the show. Not make believe fantasies that have no purpose in the show and here."
Sherlock,320mx4,Rpanich,13,Thu Apr 9 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"John and Sherlock has been a pairing since shortly after the original stories were published. Maybe it's not your cup of tea, but I don't think it's right to banish all discussion of a relationship that's been shipped for nearly a century. It's certainly not isolated to tumblr or the BBC show we all love so much. It would be more disingenuous to have to actively avoid talking about it."

Sherlock,320mx4,HImainland,7,Fri Apr 10 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"Holmes and Watson flee London during the Oscar Wilde trials.  ""It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns"" --Adventure of the three students. Watson's descriptions of Holmes and male clients are often pretty charged.  There're some okay examples in The Empty House, and I'm too lazy to find more. Watson and Holmes love Turkish baths, which was already a gay thing back then. After Watson gets married, Holmes reads unrequited love poems.  (Plutarch in The Boscombe Valley Mystery.)   There're more, but it's late."
Sherlock,320mx4,Rpanich,3,Fri Apr 10 07:49:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, appreciate it! Even though I don't ship it (at least not the BBC incarnation), I don't want to be ignorant of the potential arrows to it in the literature (or at least, read it and decide for myself).  I've been meaning to reread the books, I'll be on the lookout for these things."
Sherlock,320mx4,HImainland,7,Fri Apr 10 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"haha if you think these pairings have only been around since tumblr, you're dead wrong.  Lestrade and Mycroft I think is a bit out there, but Sherlock and John? Absolutely not. They love each other deeply and people just have different opinions on what kind of love it is."
Sherlock,320mx4,Rpanich,-3,Thu Apr 9 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"It just sort of seems like people can't accept that men can be in a close relationship with other men without having a homosexual relationship.   John has dated multiple women and denied romance with sherlock. He also said being gay is fine, so clearly he's not the type to be ashamed of it if he were. Sherlock, with the exclusion of Irene, has claimed to be asexual (married to his work).   The only evidence for them being gay would be that they're close friends and other people keep making jokes about them being gay."
Sherlock,320mx4,HImainland,9,Thu Apr 9 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"If one of them was a woman, nobody would even be making arguments like this. They'd just accept that they would get together, and not question it. Take Castle for example. It's a detective show about two main characters who solve mysteries. It's different in a lot of ways (please don't dwell on this, it's just an example), but similar enough that they can be compared in this respect. Nobody ever said ""It bothers me that a man and a woman can't be in a close relationship on TV/Film without being romantically/sexually involved"". No. Everyone just accepted it when they got together, and was expecting it from the beginning. But Sherlock? People are turning a blind eye to some very common romance tropes just because they're both men."
Sherlock,320mx4,Rpanich,-3,Fri Apr 10 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"Well, no, people are ignoring it because they're both straight men.   It'd be more like shipping Will and Grace, and ignoring the fact that Will identifies as a gay man.   Edit: also 30 Rock played with that with Jack and Liz. And I don't watch it, but I hear elementary is keeping it platonic."
Sherlock,320mx4,9minutes,7,Fri Apr 10 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"Sherlock isn't interested in women, he makes this clear in the first episode. Maybe he isn't interested in men either. Apparantly Sherlock ""will outlive god trying to have the last word"" but he stays very silent about what he's interested in. What we know, though, is that he's definitely not straight.  John never actually says specifically that he's straight. He just says he ""isn't gay"" which leaves room for the possibility of being bisexual.  All in all, things are left pretty ambiguous, so you can't say it's a problem because they're both straight."
Sherlock,320mx4,polybius2,-2,Fri Apr 10 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"Irene?   But even then, that seemed to be an anomaly. Sherlock says he's married to his work, and doesn't seem to be interested in anyone.   John says he's not gay, but it's always in conjuncture with people saying he's dating or interested in sherlock. If he were simply saying ""I'm not gay"", but it was unrelated to what was happening, it'd be like some form of Tourette's. He's clearly using it to mean ""I am not interested in sherlock"". Even if he were bi, he's explicitly made his relationship with Sherlock very clear.   If you had a male friend who only went on dates with men, and he was close friends with a woman was completely uninterested in dating, except for one date she went on with a woman, would you assume they'll end up together? How about if every time someone mentioned that, they'd seem offended and loudly proclaim that they weren't straight. Would you assume they were actually hiding their orientation and were secretly straight and/or bi, and were secretly in love?"
Sherlock,320mx4,sherlawked,4,Fri Apr 10 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sherlock was romantically/sexually interested in Irene, i think he was fascinated by her cleverness.  I understand what you're saying, but you can't really compare John and Sherlock's relationship to one in real life because writers don't control real life. Writers purposefully implement plots and tropes and emotions and events which are messier and vaguer in reality, and so you can judge characters and their relationships with more certainty than you can judge real people and their relationships. I think you should look at this as the work of fiction it is, rather than taking it so personally."

Sherlock,31kpyw,Sabe24,3,Mon Apr 6 13:04:38 2015 UTC,I completely agree. It was a distraction method in some sort of way.
Sherlock,31kpyw,weirdforces,6,Mon Apr 6 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"If the account he gave Anderson is right, then he used the call to sort of hold John in place- so that he (John) wouldn't be able to see anything happening ""behind the scenes""."
Sherlock,31kpyw,Sabe24,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:40:27 2015 UTC,This actually makes me realize how uncomfortable he must have been at John's wedding...
Sherlock,31kpyw,TheDoctorWho-vian,18,Sat Apr 11 13:00:30 2015 UTC,"He didn't actually link the statement about that missing clue with season 4. He mentioned in an interview 2 or so years ago that people were missing a clue about the Fall. Some people have speculated that was the ball used to stop Sherlock's pulse. Then much more recently he said there was a reveal in Season 4 that was from a set up from before that no one has noticed. I personally hope you are right and we will finally find out more about the Fall in Season 4 but unless there is an interview I missed, he hasn't yet linked the two statements."
Sherlock,31kpyw,dragongrrl56,36,Mon Apr 6 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to imagine that he jumped into the truck bed of laundry, rolled off it, sprayed some fake blood around, and used the ball to stop his pulse. This has been my theory forever and to be honest, I'm sticking with it."
Sherlock,31kpyw,pdeluc99,15,Mon Apr 6 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"That was sort of the fan-favorite theory after season 2, which is why they sort of teased the audience with it in the season 3 premiere.  The first thing Sherlock said regarding him surviving was ""I calculated that there were thirteen possibilities once I'd invited Moriarty onto the roof. I wanted to avoid dying, if at all possible. The first scenario involved hurling myself into a parked hospital van filled with body bags. Impossible. The angle was too steep.""  I took that to mean he was talking about the parked truck and specifically was dismissing it."
Sherlock,31kpyw,AlexKnolly,2,Mon Apr 6 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"Hold on, if those where body bags, they were filled with dead people, he could have got Molly to chuck a dead one out ?"
Sherlock,31kpyw,ciny,11,Mon Apr 6 20:08:01 2015 UTC,because the way he jumped there is NO WAY he could jump that far.
Sherlock,31kpyw,pdeluc99,7,Mon Apr 6 10:58:19 2015 UTC,So we're gonna assume the big truck of soft things below the jump just drove away coincidently at the same time sherlock hit the ground? Sorry everyone but It's pretty clear he jumped into that truck.
Sherlock,31kpyw,ciny,9,Mon Apr 6 13:44:49 2015 UTC,So we're going to assume sherlock can backflip at least 6m?

Sherlock,31kpyw,Sabe24,5,Mon Apr 6 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"He would have to have jumped way off the roof to get into the truck. But in the episode, he clearly sort of tips himself over. Sorry, but physics disproves your theory. There's no way Sherlock cleared the space necessary to fall into the truck.   My guess is that the truck was something set up by Mycroft as a just-in-case thing, possibly for another ""possibility"" that Sherlock calculated.

It’s something that Sherlock did that was very out of character, but which nobody has picked up on.""  and here is my pre-series 3 hypothesis:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Sherlock/comments/1psqrm/out_of_character_one_last_kick_at_this_can_before/  My conclusions are likely off, but I stand by my 'out of character' moment."
Sherlock,31kpyw,Trent_Boyett,2,Mon Apr 6 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed (that you may very well have caught the ""out of character"" moment but that your conclusions are likely wrong).  I was with you up til this:   Why else did the girl scream when she saw Sherlock? Would a family resemblance to her abductor, whom she knew well but was betrayed by, be enough?   No way.  Mycroft looks nothing like Sherlock (which I actually think was a mistake on the part of the show, they should've picked someone who actually looked like Cumberbatch), there's just no resemblance there.   They're not even close, let alone close enough for a child, even, to mistake the two.  Also, making Mycroft a villain is waaaay out of canon and they've made a point of sticking to it as much as possible, at least in terms of characters and themes and such."

You can see the truck off to the right with something suspiciously soft/inflatable/fluffy looking in the bed.   Next you see the truck pulling off in the shot from above, Also, the large rectangle in the sidewalk that's right next to sherlock seems to be exactly the size of the truck bed.   Finally, if you back up to when John first gets on the scene, Sherlock tells him to go back to where he just was, which was behind this short, wide building.

Sherlock,31kpyw,jacobl124,2,Mon Apr 6 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"Here is the more recent interview where he talks about some set up no one is talking about. Of course we're still asking questions about the Fall because none of those scenarios displayed feel right so I don't think that's it.  “There are some answers coming to questions nobody has asked,” he said. “We’re very exultant about a little thing we’ve set up that no one is talking about.”  Recent Interview"
Sherlock,31kpyw,Dukes_Mangola,0,Mon Apr 6 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"That's not a landing pad, that's hospital waste (in garbage bags)."
Sherlock,31kpyw,SirAlexH,6,Mon Apr 6 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"I'm standing by my theory that Moriarty is a psychological splinter personality that Sherlock subconsciously created in order to satisfy his pathological need for a villain that can challenge him - The Final Problem. Richard Brook was really an actor hired by Holmes, acting under his Moriarty splinter personality. Consider:  Moriarty shoots himself. Aside from the continuity issues in the visuals of the shot itself, Sherlock's entire motivation for meeting Moriarty on the roof is to unmask him and destroy the illusion of Brook, rather than die in shame and disgrace. Eventually he seems to accept his fate, 'confesses' to Watson, and jumps, thinking that by falsifying his death and temporarily sacrificing his reputation that he'll save his friends.  However, even with Sherlock's death, there are ostensibly still a dead body and gun on the roof of the hostpital - a body that is clearly the result of a suicide, and that would presumably be identifiable as James Moriarty and not Richard Brook by none less than Mycroft Holmes, not to mention John Watson. Not only does Mycroft not do this before Season 2, the body is at no point alluded to. What happened to this crucial piece of evidence? It never existed in the first place.  Moreover, with Moriarty's death Sherlock's only motivation now becomes saving his friends' lives, by dying. He stands to gain absolutely nothing by sacrificing his reputation before killing himself. He could just as easily have quickly explained to John the situation before jumping. Why does the eternally proud Sherlock Holmes choose to make a false confession to Watson and destroy his legacy, when all he needed to sacrifice at that point was his life? This is the break in character that I believe the creators are alluding to. The only reason Sherlock would tell this story is if he believed he stood to gain something and if he thought he would be believed - and the only way this lie is believable is if there is no body on the roof behind him to be identified as Moriarty. He's finally understood that Moriarty is, in fact, his own subconscious creation - his confession is genuine.  Remember that probably Sherlock's most famous wisdom is that when the impossible is eliminated, whatever remains must be the truth. Moriarty is, quite literally, Sherlock - they both explicitly say as much to one another throughout their showdown. This theory also explains the screaming girl, and Moriarty's eventual resurrection. How Sherlock survived the fall is honestly irrelevant - this is the key detail that I think everyone is missing."

We've worked out how Sherlock survives, and actually shot part of what really happened.""  If they shot part of it already, then its most likely something we've seen. My bet is on the theory that has Moriarty plunging to the ground wearing that Sherlock mask.  And while I'm at it, Sherlock tells John that that phone call was his note. Would he leave a note? Is that out of character?"

Sherlock,31kpyw,Nicotineandsaccharin,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he also said that within the first week The Reichenbach Fall aired, so most likely people did notice it within the two years between the episodes. This new detail he's talking about that no one's paying attention to is ostensibly separate, and he probably means most popular sites about TV aren't mentioning it, because on the internet no stone is left unturned, some obscure blog out there probably is fixated on whatever it is Moffat's talking about."

Sherlock told us himself how he survived. It wasn't farfetched, it was pretty unremarkable actually. His brother uses his influence to  get rid of the sniper aimed at john, they close down the street, sherlock jumps into an inflatable bag and then momentarily cuts off his pulse...it was just for john."
Sherlock,31kpyw,improbablesalad,2,Thu Apr 9 12:16:57 2015 UTC,My problem with that theory is.. what's the point? If Mycroft got the snipers called off.. why even fake your own death?

Sherlock,319ibt,LostMyKebab,14,Fri Apr 3 01:55:24 2015 UTC,"My theory about how Sherlock survives the jump off the building: Nothing was planned. The suicide of Moriarty took him by surprise and Sherlock actually jumped off, and actually almost died. The main theme throughout the whole series is that John is the only thing Sherlock is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect. S3E1 Sherlock hijacks a bike, speeds through town, and jumps in a fire for him. S3E3 he literally kills a guy to protect John's wife and thus John. I think the plan was Sherlock to extrapolate the code to call off the assassins from Moriarty while on the roof, and once he was dead, Sherlock had no choice but to actually kind of die.   About S1E1, and the pills. I like the theory that there is nothing special about the pills, they were the taxi driver's medicine, which to a normal person would be toxic, but to him somehow were medicine. It fits his theme of ""outliving"" the other people. He uses the disease that is killing him as a weapon to kill others.   As for how he got the bike from the pedestrian, I can imagine things I would say to someone in that scenario, and I think Sherlock is much more clever than I."
Sherlock,319ibt,psu5307,3,Fri Apr 3 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would've believed that sherlock just jumped, but at that height surely he would've sustained some injuries but we didn't see any major ones when he visited john at his tombstone."

The London public who see the big billboard aren't shocked - no one stops in the street, no car crashes etc. The pub scene cuts out before we see the reaction of the pub goers.   Moriarty previously wrote a big IOU in the windows - a message anyone could see but which had a private meaning for Sherlock. He may be doing this again with the ""did you miss me"""

At this time, Sherlock mentions that Mycoft and the Baker Street Irregulars were involved. This implies that there was a plan and that he jumped off the building, most likely onto a big rubber mat. In ""Reichenbach Falls,"" a few hours before he jumps, Sherlock asks Molly for help. Where does Molly work? The morgue. What can she get that no one else can? A dead body. This is what John saw after he crossed the street: a dead body dressed in Sherlock's clothes, possibly with a dark curly wig. One of the Baker Street Irregulars bumped into John with the bicycle to delay his arrival at the body and disorient him a little more. (John was already distraught from the phone call and watching his best friend jump to his death.) Several of them, posing as by-standers and hospital personnel, surrounded the body and whisked it away quickly, so that John could not get a close look at it. Nor could any of the snipers. (The plotters would have had to warm up the dead body before using it or John would have known as soon as he touched it that it was not Sherlock.) So, there was no Sherlock mask on Moriarty's dead body. Alas, there was no jumping through windows, ruffling of hair, or passionate Mollykissing. But the fantasy sequence WAS fun to watch."

But if they prevented the attack, the terrorists would know the government were on to them. So they filled the plane with recently deceased, blow it up, media reports it. Terrorists think they succeeded, loads of people saved from fire-y death.   It is based on an event that happened in WW2. British government had cracked a key German code. In a coded transmission the Germans said they were going to bomb the crap out of Coventry. If the British upped defences or prepared to stop this attack, the Germans would have known the code had been compromised. Sadly, you can't fake a city, so the government let the attack happen. Coventry is a mess of concrete 60s buildings because of this. But the Germans didn't know the British had cracked the code and thus kept using it and supplying much useful info."

The man in the car had a ticket stub and napkins from a flight that he clearly wasn't on. Flight 007 and Bond Air were real memories.  The goal was to let the terrorists shoot it down. The plane had to have bodies on-board so the terrorists wouldn't know the government had caught on yet. It wasn't meant to be a long term charade; it was about buying time with stolen dead bodies. Dressing a body and storing it in a refrigerator for a bit isn't that hard for a government agency to do.

Or, an episode of both, out of the seasons, just cumberbatch starring the doctor and vice verca with no explanations, no questions asked, just that. Would have been better with Matt Smith, because he would better fit to the Sherlocks role than Capaldi(and his is not dissing of Capaldi).

I think they are all great, and would gladly re-watch any of them at any time. But I ranked them by how likely I am to randomly re-watch an episode if I only have time for one. My preference is for episodes that examine relationships, and I'm slightly less interested in episodes that focus on solving mysteries. This is why ""Study in Pink"" ranks so high, for example, as it show us the beginning of the Sherlock/John relationship. Also, it was the first episode so it was full of wonderful surprises, and I don't ever want to forget how that made me feel: discovering the great writing, the amazing actors (this first scene, with John alone in his room!), the ground-breaking cinematography, hearing that music for the first time and ending with the introduction of Mycroft, which was the final clue that Moffat and Gatis are TRUE Holmes aficionados."

The point is I love this show. I recognise it has flaws, no such thing as perfection. I think the Great Game and Reichenbach are both episodes of perfection and are basically interchangeable, depends on what I'm feeling like. And the Blind Banker is consistently the bottom because admittedly that is the one episode that I think has some definite flaws but even that is an episode I love to watch. I think people give too little credit to Hounds and Hearse. I love Gatiss as a writer and I think both episodes are great. Hounds is friggin awesome and Hearse is an awesome opener with fantastic moments and ideas. Scandal is awesome. Sign of Three is probably the funniest and for me the most rewatchable.  And of course Study in Pink introduced our character, does what only the best pilots do. Hook you onto the show for the long haul. And His Last Vow is just an awesome episode. The point is...I love the show. it's inspired me to read all the stories and to catch up on other adaptations. Wonderful acting, writing, cinematography (oh my god the stuff they do in this show). Some days I like character episodes, other day I like case stuff which is why I'd say Reichenbach and Great Game sit on top and interchange. And of course Many Happy Returns doesn't really count it's only seven minutes. But it's a fun seven minutes. And the unaired pilot is definitely the weakest of all filmed BBC Sherlock material.

Why is the imagined sexuality of fictional characters something that people feel the need to get defensive over, in one way or another?"
Sherlock,30toj9,khalkhalash,4,Tue Mar 31 10:40:44 2015 UTC,"I'm usually with you. It actually annoys me how many shows become about the sexual relationships of the leads and it overshadows the plot. And I don't get how people loose their shit over gay subtext in the Hobbit or Supernatural where the writers kinda half-ass it in there for shits and giggles. Sherlock isn't one of those shows.   We get three episodes a series. Every scene and piece of dialogue is carefully edited by a small pool of writers with a master plan. They are doing something careful and considered and very very planned. Moffat is a freak for romance and Gatiss is a freak for Oscar Wilde and Sherlock Holmes. There is so much subtext; there is subtext on top of the subtext on top of the subtext. All of it clues to their plot plans and not all of it about them being gay (though much of it is). Because this is the story they've been telling since the beginning. The romance can't overshadow the plot when it IS the plot.  So, if I seem defensive it's because I think a lot of fans are being willfully blind and some people are going to be really pissed off when Sherlock and Watson end up together. If I come on here after some reveal and I hear anyone say, 'it came out of left field' or 'they changed everything because of the stupid tumblr fans!' I will definitely lose my shit and overturn a table or two because this isn't one of those cases of people cobbling a romance out of a few charged glances.  Personally, I'm just calling it like I see it."
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,5,Tue Mar 31 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"some people are going to be really pissed off when Sherlock and Watson end up together.   Could be.  I, myself, would not be upset by it, or anything like that, but if they did something like this it would be a pretty major departure from canon for a show that otherwise tries to stay close to it, within the context of a modern world.  The homoerotic subtext that some people get from the old novels is all fine and well, but I can not recall any story in which it was even close to a focal point, and I can recall even less to suggest that in any canonical adaptation, so far, there has been a version where Watson and Holmes end up as boyfriends to each other.  Sherlock's sexuality is something of a fascination with scholars and avid fans of the genre, but from what I can tell it's not really something that got a good deal of exposition in the series, itself.  I would guess that the reason for this is that Sherlock's sexuality is unimportant, in regards to the story.  Which might very well be what Doyle intended to say, in his work: it doesn't matter if he is gay, or straight, or some combination of the two, or something else entirely. What matters is that Holmes is a brilliant detective, capable of whatever needs to be done."
Sherlock,30toj9,khalkhalash,6,Tue Mar 31 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"This is a thoughtful post and I do see where you're coming from. I would have been very happy myself if loyalty to the source material was the show plan. Ignoring the subtext, that is the show we get in the first two seasons. There were a few lines in s1e3 that made me think they were planning to make the bromance romantic and actually s2e1 made me even more worried. Even so, series 3, as Sherlock says in his best man speech, ""Is where everything changes."" The tone is very different but still makes enough references to actions in the earlier seasons showing parallels and planning. I'm less worried now. I think Gatiss and the actors will add enough subtly to the end result that it will actually be satisfying transition. At least I hope so.  First look at how Sherlock is mentally compromised in series 3. If you compare his deductions of Mary to his deductions in series 2 you find they're cloudy, with unclear associations. I'd mostly blame two years of mayhem and torture. Then he falls back on drugs with the flimsiest of excuses. His emotions are the closest to the surface we've ever seen and I don't think he is the same man he was the season before. It was all just 'transport' right up until it wasn't. Now look at him. Look at his deduction process during his best man speech. He drops things, he stammers, he hits himself in the face. Compare that to his previous seasons where he was sometimes loud and exuberant but in control of his deduction process. Ask yourself why these deductions are so violent?  I invite you to read one meta on S3E2. It is long and certainly biased but it has some rather specific and clever insights into how the show writer's are using Sherlock's mind palace and how his fake versions of his brother, John, and others interact with him. Give it a go. Feel free to pick it a part. It can be fun.  The mind palace transitions and subtext in this episode are so clever it almost makes up for how annoyed I was by the narrative coincidence that the two cases Sherlock talks most about in his speech just happen to be related to the on going murder in the room. (almost).  So what I'm saying is, Sherlock's sexuality didn't matter but he has become emotionally compromised and now it does."
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,3,Wed Apr 1 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"it would be a pretty major departure from canon   Would it?  In canon, there are two big moments where Watson is amazed to learn how much Holmes cares about him.  So exploring their relationship is definitely canonical.  And the gay subtext is pretty overt.  Watson and Holmes fled London during the Oscar Wilde trials.  Watson's descriptions of men are often very enthusiastic.  If I recall correctly, they turned Holmes' room into storage while both of them lived in 221b.  If you'd like, I can dig up the sources.  And in terms of it being a focal point, there's no reason to think it'll be a focal point in this version either.  I mean, yeah, there'll be at least one episode about it, but they can still mostly focus on crime."
Sherlock,30toj9,polybius2,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:53:01 2015 UTC,"It certainly wouldn't come out of left field. They have certainly hammered in that subtext. But I honestly don't think it'd work.  A real Victorian version of the story where Holmes and Watson were secretly lovers would, actually work a lot better. In Victorian times, they have a strong motive to pretend to be just dear friends, because you could be jailed for being gay. Gay relationships back then often worked a lot like Holmes & Watson's relationship in order to maintain deniability, right up to having wives in order to seem respectable.   In our times, though, if they felt that way, why not go for it? No-one would give a crap. They aren't going to get arrested. All their friends would be happy for them."

Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,3,Wed Apr 1 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Its because historically there has been subtext. Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle was gay, sure there's controversy about that but its pretty well accepted. Of course he hid it, Oscar Wilde had just been arrested. Sherlock has pretty much always been considered above things like sex but John was repeatedly referred to as a ""confirmed Bachelor"" even though he was married several times and women seem to flit in and out of his life forgotten by the plot and the writer from time to time. That was Victorian for gay....that's how it was portrayed in literature. Much like how gay plots were all clever subtext when gay characters weren't allowed in early cinema.  Basically its there because its always been part of the Sherlock Holmes culture, Its not like fanfic is a new thing. As to why people get defensive about it well...people get defensive about pretty much anything so your guess is as good as mine."
Sherlock,30toj9,ShadowRancher,8,Tue Mar 31 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"Would you mind citing a source on whether or not Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle was gay? I can find that he was married twice and fathered 5 children. It doesn't mean he wasn't gay, but I can't find anything reputable that says he was."
Sherlock,30toj9,mgrote,7,Tue Mar 31 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"I never heard such a thing... It's certainly not common gossip. He had five children and two wives.  John was never referred to as a ""confirmed bachelor"" in the print stories. His liking for the ladies was occasionally commented on. His marriages were inconsistent because ""continuity"" wasn't really a thing back then, and Doyle was not a terribly meticulous writer. Watson, like Doyle, seems to have married twice, once after the loss of his first wife. But Doyle wasn't great at fine detail so he lost track occasionally."

Mofftiss's Sherlock is very much rooted in the original stories, when Sherlock was asexual. This is definitely reflected in the show. Sure, Sherlock makes close friendships- such as with John.- but that doesn't automatically mean that they're ""in love""/gay/whatever (this is my personal biggest gripe about Johnlock- people can be friends, you know!)."
Sherlock,30toj9,Sabe24,11,Mon Mar 30 21:18:43 2015 UTC,"While I 100% agree with this, Benedict has also said that he thinks Irene and Sherlock went off and had a shag after he rescued her. I find it very amusing that his headcannon differs from Moffat's"
Sherlock,30toj9,ligirl,2,Tue Mar 31 01:20:38 2015 UTC,I read that interview and I think he was only joking when he said that. Afterwards he went on to describe what Sherlock would do if he were to get intimate with someone.
Sherlock,30toj9,wishicouldtravel,4,Sat Apr 4 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"the original stories, when Sherlock was asexual   There's a lot in the original canon to suggest that he isn't."
Sherlock,30toj9,polybius2,4,Thu Apr 2 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"""It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns"" --Adventure of the three students.  The Oscar Wilde trials started in April of that year, driving thousands of men out of London to duck a crackdown on homosexuality.  There are a million more clues."
Sherlock,30toj9,polybius2,2,Thu Apr 2 07:57:01 2015 UTC,"yeah like their weakness for the Turkish baths, for instance."
Sherlock,30toj9,eeyore102,13,Thu Apr 2 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"You say you’ve heard that Moffat lies, but have you actually read some of the things he’s said? I’m genuinely curious, because  Sherlock’s show runners offer the final word on Moriarty’s fate (2012)  Moffat and Benedict about Sherlock’s drug usage (2012)  ...both of these things are entirely logical and believable as well. Would you disagree that it is in their best interests to purposefully mislead the audience as to not spoil future plots? What he's saying is so vague and misleading, its almost comical. He’s not gay, but he’s not straight? “If he was asexual, there would be no tension in that, no fun in that - (2012)""?  It’s almost as if he’s a master of talking with actually saying anything of substance."
Sherlock,30toj9,9minutes,13,Thu Apr 2 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't, and I definitely see your point. My point was that being asexual happens to be part of Holmes's character all the way back to the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, and they (Moffat/Gatiss) have been relatively faithful to Sherlock's basic character so far."
Sherlock,30toj9,Sabe24,9,Mon Mar 30 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yup.  ""Sherlock Holmes, again, must have sexual impulses because human beings tend to -- most human beings, not absolutely all, but that's the majority. The fact is, he decides to put all that in an iron box to make his brain work better. Of course, the fact that that iron box bounces around and shakes and bangs from the inside is what makes the story interesting. He wants to rise above us like a snowcapped mountain, but he's actually a volcano, and that's where the story is. That's where the story is."""
Sherlock,30toj9,eeyore102,2,Mon Mar 30 22:55:41 2015 UTC,Yep. Most of /r/DoctorWho and /r/Gallifrey would not disagree.

Sherlock,30toj9,9minutes,22,Mon Mar 30 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"And I think it works much better that way. I love Johnlock fanfic as much as the next person, but I really wouldn't want it showing up in the actual show."
Sherlock,30toj9,ligirl,21,Mon Mar 30 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think that Sherlock and John's relationship is much more interesting given the fact that they love each other so much, but they are still effectively just bros. I think that's what's fantastic about ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" -- it challenges the boundaries of what our society deems ""normal relationships."" It sets up the idea that two straight men (or one straight and one asexual) can be in love with each other without being sexually attracted to one another. I mean what is being in love with someone if it's not what John and Sherlock have with each other? There doesn't need to be sexual attraction to justify it! That's what makes it interesting!"
Sherlock,30toj9,Langlie,14,Tue Mar 31 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"What kills me is that we, as a society, dismiss these relationships and insist they have to be sexual."
Sherlock,30toj9,Banzai51,11,Tue Mar 31 07:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yep. We allow women to have these kinds of relationships, but God forbid a man might have a close loving relationship to another man without it being sexual. It is almost like society cannot stand for men to actually have any emotional depth in their relationships unless it involves sex."
Sherlock,30toj9,EnIdiot,3,Tue Mar 31 09:55:40 2015 UTC,"This bugs me as well, to be honest. You get two people who are really close and on TV and it has to become sexual unless they are related. It is like tv doesn't believe in love and respect at all. It has to be sex."
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,4,Tue Mar 31 14:00:22 2015 UTC,Maybe TV is right. Maybe we should give up in real life and all become bonobos.

Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,-4,Fri Apr 3 03:36:20 2015 UTC,But it will.
Sherlock,30toj9,BetterCalldeGaulle,16,Fri Apr 3 03:52:15 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, down voters take me!  Everyone complains how Moffat repeats himself on Doctor Who with the same plots over and over. I can name at least 3 cases just in Doctor Who where he's pulled a 'surprise, this character is gay/bi!' off the top of my head. He loves it. He loves romantic stories. He'll do it here. It's not like Gatiss is against the idea. You're downvotes just show you're not paying attention to who the writers are or the character's history.  And for anyone saying it will dishonor the character; Sherlock Holmes has been the following in major tv/movie productions: A mouse, a woman, had more than one female Watson, an idiot with a genius Watson, a bouncy coke fiend looking for a fish, a doctor, The Doctor, a dog, a Guy Ritchie character, Data, a ghostly personification of his fictional self, had a robot Watson, and yes he's been gay. He's arguably the most reproduced character ever. This isn't new. Gay Holmes isn't new. It hasn't been denied for 'over 100 years' as Moffat (the admitted fanboy) is saying. He well knows there have been essays written on Holmes homosexual subtext almost since the beginning. This won't dishonor the character in Moffat's eyes and it will happen.   My guess is they're purposely playing it slow so it isn't a 'gay people' show. The people on Tumblr are a bit crazy but they aren't wrong about this."
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,5,Tue Mar 31 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Not because I think that Moffat's ideologically unwilling to go there or because he doesn't want to disrupt the canon, but because it would honestly ruin the show. Sherlock is a brilliant show that relies on a narrative the explores many different themes and plots at once. If Sherlock and John get together, it just becomes the ""Sherlock and John get together"" show and completely detracts from the actual story telling. And frankly, having them get together would make both of them and their relationship far less interesting than it is currently.  Oh, and also because, who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but John Watson is definitely and unquestionably straight. I don't think he can suddenly become physically attracted to Sherlock, and it would be disingenuous to suggest that he could. Now, I think that John Watson could be said to be in love with Sherlock (A Scandal and Belgravia basically said as much, and the writers too in the commentary), but I don't think that he could be in a relationship with Sherlock in that sense."
Sherlock,30toj9,Langlie,9,Tue Mar 31 05:09:10 2015 UTC,"Not gay at all. Except i think there is less subtext in an Oscar Wilde play  Can't forget this scene transition with Sherlock on his knees wiping white stuff off his face that switches via Watson's mouth. Multiple people in graphics and editing made that as ungay as possible with approval from the director.  Glass screens, green flowers,  and a wedding where the only vow we hear is Sherlock's and the only proposal we see is John to his best man.  If Moffat actually thought fans were funny for reading into it he's going about it the wrong way in Sign of Three.  Oh, and John is probably bi. The show implies in a few ways that he had a thing with Sholto. The man he never shuts up about to Mary but for some reason never mentioned to his unavailable roommate."
Sherlock,30toj9,BetterCalldeGaulle,4,Tue Mar 31 07:45:21 2015 UTC,lol don't forget the scene where they literally lit John Watson with the colors of the bisexual flag.
Sherlock,30toj9,eeyore102,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:43:28 2015 UTC,Can you explain the reasoning for the John Sholto relationship?
Sherlock,30toj9,SirAlexH,10,Tue Mar 31 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"Mary suggests it with ""Neither of us was the first.""  i.e. ""Neither of us was the first person he obsessed over and/or loved.""  Which is such a weird thing to include!  I mean, in a show with over the top sexual ambiguity (a goddamn lesbian fell in love with the hero), why introduce a new character with a suggestive line like that?  And, hell, why include him at all, if not to suggest something?  ""John had a previous Sherlock"" is such a weird move.  But ""John's no stranger to bisexuality"" actually does something for an ambiguous gay romance."
Sherlock,30toj9,polybius2,9,Thu Apr 2 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"All I can say is, how often has Moffat NOT written a love story? I can remember more than one episode of Doctor Who where I thought, ""Really Moffat? Another love interest for the Doctor, another kiss? He went 30 years without kissing anyone (ignoring the 8th doctor) before you and RTD! It's kinda diluting the value of the show."" Girl in the Fireplace, River Song, River Song's mum, etc. all Moffat plots. I grew up with the 4th Doctor. I thought it was ridiculous. I had to adjust or let it ruin the show for me.   Heck, look at Curse of the Fatal Death... the spoof Moffat wrote where The Doctor is willing to give up adventures and settle down with a lovely woman but regenerates and is turned into a woman. (S)He runs off with the Master instead. This is a Moffat Doctor story with TWO love interests AND a ""Surprise, the Doctor now likes men!"" twist. All written at a time when many fans were against the Doctor being a sexual being at all. Sure, it's a spoof but in retrospect, given his time as Show Runner, it is a self-indulgent spoof that shows us Moffat's mind. Moffat even admits in interviews he's a whore for the fans and Gatiss holds him back. Heck, his favorite movie is the fucking Princess Bride. So just based on these things I'm sure Moffat is all in on the Johnlock.   The only question you have to ask is, do you think Gatiss wants to keep all this gay-subtext as just subtext or is he all in too?  (For what it's worth, when it comes, I'm sorry if this ruins your show for you. Just re-watch the first two seasons and ignore the subtext.)  As for John being gay. No, he isn't gay. He does like women, clearly, but are we sure 3 continents Watson isn't bi?"
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,3,Thu Apr 2 07:40:21 2015 UTC,"All I can say is, how often has Moffat NOT written a love story   But it IS a love story. It is the love story between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. But this doesn't mean it needs to be sexual. Why do two people have to have sex or ""get together"" to justify their love for one another? Why can't they be in love but not in lust?"
Sherlock,30toj9,Langlie,3,Tue Mar 31 10:21:55 2015 UTC,Ask Moffat your question not me. On many shows they make main characters a couple. They make a relationship about sex and not just about respect and love.  It often pisses me off too.   But I really don't see them forgoing it here.
Sherlock,30toj9,boring_story,3,Wed Apr 1 04:23:46 2015 UTC,"The only question you have to ask is, do you think Gatiss wants to keep all this gay-subtext as just subtext or is he all in too?   THIS. This exactly."
Sherlock,30toj9,eeyore102,4,Wed Apr 1 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"On its face, the relationship gets less interesting a it gets more sexual, but when you see it through that lens, new facets open up.  I love John as a jealous, baffled, desperate romantic.  And in terms of ""The Sherlock and John Get Together Show"", what makes you say that?  Mofftisson aren't going to fall into cliches.  I mean, there's always the obvious option: John and Sherlock solve crimes, also happen to be married.  If it's true that it's been a romance the entire time, not much has to change."
Sherlock,30toj9,polybius2,2,Tue Mar 31 11:25:40 2015 UTC,"I thought Moffat said that he thought Sherlock was biologically straight but functionally asexual, pointing out the line in an ACD story that says Sherlock finds women ""distracting."" That was in an interview a few years back."
Sherlock,30toj9,Langlie,5,Thu Apr 2 07:31:52 2015 UTC,Technically you could call both both Sherlock and John bisexual and it wouldn't conflict with Moffat's statements.    So he basically said nothing.
Sherlock,30toj9,Poperama,5,Tue Mar 31 07:38:57 2015 UTC,This right here. I can see it. And it'd be just like him to say that to mean this. Wonder if he practises beforehand or something.

Yeah I wouldn't take this too seriously.

Their references to ""old resentments"" and ""too much history between us."" Perhaps whatever Mycroft did or didn't do to the ""other one"" left bad blood between Mycroft and Sherlock.  I always wondered if this had anything to do with Moriarty. I've never fully understood Moriarty's line that ""I owe you a fall."" I understand the fall referenced Sherlock's literal death fall and metaphorical fall from fame, but why did Moriarty ""owe"" him that? Doesn't that imply that Sherlock has somehow done that to Moriarty in the past? We know Sherlock didn't know Moriarty before the series, but perhaps Sherlock's childhood or youth somehow ties in with Moriarty's in some unseen way."

Sherlock,30eftk,beckoning_cat,134,Thu Mar 26 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"It's a reference to a character hypothesized by William S. Baring-Gould, a noted Holmes expert. Because societal norms at the time would require a male heir look after the family estate, he hypothesized that there was a third brother we have never seen. He named the character Sherrinford, after one of the original names Conan Doyle had considered using for the character that became Sherlock."
Sherlock,30eftk,TheCheshireCody,9,Thu Mar 26 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"I've never really looked into it, but was Sherlock a name he made up? Obviously people with that name today were probably named after the character."
Sherlock,30eftk,Waywoah,12,Fri Mar 27 01:15:35 2015 UTC,Sherlock was an old English surname that Doyle chose for his character's first. Apparently it means bright hair.
Sherlock,30eftk,derekjosh,4,Fri Mar 27 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I've met a few people with the last name Sherlock and they all were blonde. Shylock is a Shakespearean character, maybe there's a connection there."

Sherlock,30eftk,ginger_jedi,22,Fri Mar 27 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this subject has been beaten to death, but I am new to the forum and didn't see this brought up.   In the third season, episode: His Last Vow, Sherlock was excommunicated for killing Charles Augustus Magnussen.  A peer was talking to Mycroft about it, and accussed Mycroft of compassion towards Sherlock. After dismissing the possibility that he is experiencing brotherly compassion, Mycroft remarks, “You know what happened to the other one.”  The other one who? Other brother?"
Sherlock,30eftk,Sabe24,42,Thu Mar 26 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that he meant the other brother- Sherrinford Holmes, rumoured to be played by Tom Hiddleston in the upcoming season."
Sherlock,30eftk,Hyperman360,30,Thu Mar 26 19:40:09 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if Moriarty himself was Sherrinford.
Sherlock,30eftk,ChrisVolkoff,28,Thu Mar 26 21:30:10 2015 UTC,That.. would be a twist.
Sherlock,30eftk,saltytrey,67,Thu Mar 26 23:06:53 2015 UTC,"Calm down, M. Night."
Sherlock,30eftk,Sabe24,5,Fri Mar 27 00:44:18 2015 UTC,"I would say that it's certainly possible. Except that would definitely open a lot of holes. (Plus, I think Sherrinford is described as two years older than Mycroft...probably not Moriarty).   It's possible- there's just simply not enough info about Moriarty to confirm/deny."
Sherlock,30eftk,Drfapfap,6,Fri Mar 27 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"But Sherlock would of recognized him, and there didn't seem to be any familiarity."

Sherlock,30eftk,pouscat,5,Fri Mar 27 03:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true.   Not to mention, thinking about it, the whole Carl Powers storyline would have been completely messed up. Sherrinford and Sherlock would have grown up together- lived together. Sherlock was young when he read about Carl Powers' murder. Sherrinford couldn't have been bullied by Carl and killed him- geographically this wouldn't make sense (they probably lived pretty far away) and Mr./Mrs. Holmes, Mycroft, and Sherlock would have figured out much earlier."

It would be sort of childish, but I feel like the reveal could be great.   The first half of the episode could be Sherlock, John, and Mycroft all working together and wigging out about Moriarty. Then John disappears and has clearly gotten himself kidnapped again. Sherlock goes running to some grand estate to save everyone-  and opens the door to a roaring fire, with John and Sherrinford sitting in front of a fire with their parents, drinking tea and worrying over Sherlock and Mycroft.  Unlikely? Supremely. Awful to most fans? Yep. Hilarious for me? Indeed.  Let's see how things go."
Sherlock,30eftk,Quazz,10,Fri Mar 27 01:44:00 2015 UTC,"Rumor is a ""third brother"". Ive heard it could be Tom Hiddleston playing the brother in either the Christmas Special which is happening or possibly be in the next season. Tom and Benedict are very close friends."

Some derivative, non-Conan Doyle works have a third brother, but it is not canon. Some people have theorized that there might be a third one because of the nature of British family politics in the Victorian era, but that's weak speculation."

Sherlock,30eftk,zgardner44,-6,Thu Mar 26 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"Now that Holmes is in public domain, wouldn't anything written by anyone be technically canon?"
Sherlock,30eftk,gnarpnk,19,Thu Mar 26 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Being in the public domain doesn't make those works canon. The creator is dead. Unless someone discovers some kind of previously unknown Sherlock story or letter by Doyle about his creation that casts it in a different light, there will be no more new canon."
Sherlock,30eftk,jimmyolsenblues,2,Fri Mar 27 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, no, but kind of. Obviously the original canon is now quite old and there are numerous interpretations and additions, which can be seen as a ""continuation"" of the canon, I still consider the traditional canon to be just Conan Doyle's works."
Sherlock,30eftk,lou-ser,-1,Thu Mar 26 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean. To the fans of the original works, there hasn't been anything new towards canon since Doyle's death, but the majority of the average viewers currently watching Sherlock will consider ANY Holmes story to be canonical.  EDIT: In reference to OP's post: I feel as though I heard something about the third brother being brought into the show, don't ask me where, I just feel as though there was something said about it last year sometime....."

I mean, you have to at least agree that's it's pretty rude to do something like that against a person's wish, even if they claim to be okay with it later on.  It's not like had much choice, he can't be at war with his own fan base."

I think it's possible, and might even be beneficial, for us to broaden our views of what is ""Sherlock-related""."

Sherlock,2zuk1o,DestinyCE,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:46:50 2015 UTC,":) Now moving from deduction to imagination with all its weaknesses...  The night shifts suited her. After all, she had spent her teens reading late into the night for pleasure, to game, to study. As she got older the book would have to be good to keep her attention (not that she had the time), so she had a collection of bookmarks and post it notes to keep track. She was a multitasker, a generalist and perhaps a master of none except for her excellent imagination! If only she hadn't played so many computer games, thought Dad, she might be a Doctor like him by now. But he did like to spoil her, and loved her no less.   Sometimes she imagined she had Synesthesia, such was the vividness of her imagination - words were colourful and scenes popped out of the page. She was Clara Oswald, a Vietnamese looking Clara Oswald, but thats how life felt inside, like a cheeky victorian adventure. 19th Century Paris or London, the wrought iron work and spires, the corsets, the candlelight, butterflies and bats - oh what would it have been like! Physically she was small and light, and fast - she had speed, both mental and physical. What a perfect heroine she'd make to save the world!  So it cut deep into her romantic soul that she had to study electives heavy with the bureaucratic jargon of governmental policy, of occupational health and safety and legalese to protect her ass if she ever got sued for harming a patient. Her certificate of centricity felt like a duty. That was no way to save the world! And so she escaped into her gaming, and wished life was more amazing..."

You take care of your skin. All the creams lying around seem to prove that. It looks like you aren't a neat freak or a minimalist. You don't seem like someone who likes clutter either. You have everything organized a specific way, so you know exactly where to find something if you need it.  Most of the books you read seem to be fantasy and young adult books. You seem to favor books that are adapted into films or series. You seem to like Europe, hence the posters in your room, especially the trendier cities like London and Paris. It also seems pretty clear that you are female. Most likely a student. College?  Since you like video and computer games, I guess that explains spme of the (action?) figures you have lying around.

By killing himself, as both Moriarty and Sherlock (seemingly) conceded, then there was absolutely no way that the hitmen could be called off, other than Sherlock dying.

Sherlock,2z9daz,Darkprime,2,Tue Mar 17 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like this actually has a good chance of happening. Moffat and co. want to do a random Victorian episode, and this would let them do that while still tying it into the narrative of the actual series."
Sherlock,2z9daz,lanternsinthesky,7,Tue Mar 17 16:09:03 2015 UTC,Sherlocks probably high on drugs. Watson walks in and finds him stoned out of his mind mumbling a bunch of random words ends up telling some random story in Victorian London. Watson proably bitch slaps sherlock at the end to wake up him.
Sherlock,2z9daz,Mithander,-2,Tue Mar 17 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Sherlock wouldn't do that. He got high that one time in order to give Magnussen bait. But he's back to being clean again. There was that bit in the hospital after Janine left, Sherlock turned down the morphine drip. I think that was an indication that he doesn't want to use any opiates any more than he absolutely has to."
Sherlock,2z9daz,kthg,9,Tue Mar 17 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda like this idea, i hope that it is just set in that area, without it being a time traveling story.  I have actually had this idea that i would love to write like a show where you have a constant set of characters, but with each season they are just in a different era and setting. So like you could have one set in Europe in the 1930s, and another in modern day Los Angeles or in the American south in the 1800s.  Maybe that is a stupid idea, i don't know, but i at least like it."

Sherlock,2z9daz,VampAly,3,Tue Mar 17 08:34:03 2015 UTC,"There is a show like this, called Dark Shadows.  It's what the Johnny Depp movie was based on.  The series is a supernatural horror series based on this family, the Collins', and the same group of actors just play different Collins ancestors.  It jumps around all over the place.  It starts in 1967 and goes into the 1760's, 1880's, and even goes into the future 1995.  Some of the series is on Hulu.  It's a long one about 1200 episodes.  It premiered in the 60's.  There's three movies based on it including the Johnny Depp one."

Sherlock,2z9daz,lanternsinthesky,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah the movie got panned.  Pretty much par for the course for newer Tim Burton stuff.  Personally I liked it.  The actors were well chosen and the plot even followed the series.  They turned it into a comedy/horror thing like Beetlejuice.  It's a good balance.  I think the decision to make it comedy was good.  Basically instead of the cheesy campiness of the original it made it intentionally funny.  It fit.  Just so you know, the original series was shot like a soap opera.  It basically started out as one until they added in the vampire and other supernatural creatures.  That's around episode 210 or so.  It's also one of the first instances of the reluctant vampire trope, where three vampire wants to be human again.  Really cool to see that unfold for the first time.    Since it's shot soap opera style it's got cheap sets and funny dialogue but it has charm, solid plot, and some truly fantastic actors including academy award winners.  It's been one of my favorites since I saw it as a kid in the 90's on the Sci-Fi Channel.    There's also a remake of Dark Shadows made in the early 90's which is only 12 or 13 episodes that has the show start in the 1990's and then around halfway through it goes back to the 1700's.  It does the same thing as the original and uses the same actors but as different ancestors of the Collins family.  Also there's a really young Joseph Gordon Levitt as one of the main characters."

Sherlock,2z9daz,alchemyfreak990,2,Mon Mar 16 20:48:23 2015 UTC,They probably got the special confused with S4. S4 will film later this year once Benedict has filmed Doctor Strange which starts filming May.

Sherlock,2za8ed,Sabe24,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:05:57 2015 UTC,True.
Sherlock,2za8ed,AllThingsWillEnd,8,Tue Mar 17 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"Because if they tried to shoot Sherlock, Sherlock would shoot the bomb, bringing the whole place down around them (assuming Sherlock could react fast enough).   Alternatively, given how much attention Moriarty has given Sherlock in A Study in Pink, The Blind Banker and The Great Game, they may have been afraid to shoot Sherlock without getting a signal from Moriarty first.  I actually really like the idea of the laser pointers and a dud bomb, so Moriarty is just 'testing' Sherlock again just like in ASiP and TBB. Only that the set-up would have been really risky for Moriarty (who Sherlock could have shot); it would also have been hard to trick John and Sherlock."
Sherlock,2za8ed,Sabe24,2,Mon Mar 16 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Well John is military, I'm sure he can tell the difference between a real bomb and a fake bomb. Though, Moriarty is the world's only consulting criminal so I'm sure he can easily fake a bomb."

Sherlock,2z2dft,AndrizzlePC,60,Sat Mar 14 22:45:39 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. That's probably my favorite scene from all nine episodes. It was beautifully done and presented and Moriarty in the straightjacket was just fantastic.
Sherlock,2z2dft,ligirl,20,Sat Mar 14 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the way Moriarty represents his dark side and is imprisoned, to show his restraint.

Somewhere buried deep inside him are those same urges, and its only by his restraint (the chains) that he keeps it contained."

Sherlock,2z2cxl,AllThingsWillEnd,37,Sat Mar 14 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"Reading the books gave me a better insight into Sherlock Holmes as a character than watching the series and the RDJ movies did. He's not a wizard and he's not telepathic. He come up with a bunch of hypotheses, some being more likely than others, and where he's able to he tests them. It's a process.  So I'd say in this case he initially has three hypotheses -  Most Likely - Magnuson has the files at his home, commits some to memory, and refers to them as needed. This requires no special assumptions except that he owns a house and has a normal memory capacity.  Second most likely - Magnuson has the files committed entirely to memory (not many people have the capacity to memorise that much information, only rare savants such as sherlock himself).  Third most likely - Magnuson has the files on a computer and reads them in real time (he has proven himself to be intelligent and is unlikely to use something so easily detected and hacked)  So he undertakes steps to find out which hypothesis is correct. He checks the glasses first, knowing that it's least likely to be true, and will make him look like a drug addled fool thereby making Magnuson more easy to manipulate later. Then he goes to his home under false pretences and asks to see 'appledore'. The reaction here would be proof either way. If Magnuson had refused to 'show' him, Sherlock could assume that the hard copies existed. If he didn't have hard copies there'd be no reason not to 'show' him, and as we know Magnuson loves to hold power over people he could hardly help himself from proving Sherlock to be both wrong and helplessly under his control.  If the files were confirmed to exist under the house Mycroft would have had the proof to put Magnuson away and solve the problem. In the less likely event that they didn't exist outside of Magnuson's head a bullet from John's gun would solve the problem permanently.  We're seeing Sherlocks process as an outsider in his world, where he look alternately mad and magnificent by turns. From Sherlock's veiw point he's simply making deductions using a process."
Sherlock,2z2cxl,jelliknight,1 point,Sun Mar 15 08:12:48 2015 UTC,I like it.  What do you think happened to let John get his gun through security?  Do you believe Magnusson underestimated Sherlock here?
Sherlock,2z2cxl,jelliknight,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yes magnuson did underestimate sherlock, as was Sherlocks plan. That's the whole point of the diner scene. Sherlock turns his morphine up in front of Magnuson and make him think that's he's outsmarted Sherlock, that plus the leverage he has over Mary made him think Sherlock was completely under his power."

Sherlock,2yvvmt,pretty-little-angel,4,Fri Mar 13 06:16:48 2015 UTC,The art on those tins looks like it came out of the game Transistor

Sherlock,2yvvmt,raxacorico_4,3,Fri Mar 13 20:10:29 2015 UTC,I don't know why some of the pictures are the wrong way around...
Sherlock,2yvvmt,Shamashu,3,Fri Mar 13 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"I got a sample of the Mycroft tin a week ago, and it was so good I almost regret it.  So delicious with milk and sugar and very craving-inducing."
Sherlock,2yvvmt,bachrock37,2,Fri Mar 13 08:28:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder, the Mycroft one seems to have a lot of pastry type flavors. Is this a reference to the fandom cake joke?"
Sherlock,2yvvmt,Shamashu,2,Fri Mar 13 19:54:11 2015 UTC,100%  is.  The Mycroft blend tastes like drinking spice cake when you add cream and sugar
Sherlock,2yvvmt,arylicht,3,Fri Mar 13 20:36:30 2015 UTC,Kinda disappointing not seeing Moriarty thea here
Sherlock,2yvvmt,CausionEffect,2,Fri Mar 13 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"Moriar-Tea couldn't be a tea, it'd have to be a nasty energy drink that seems innocuous, but ends up giving you hemorrhoids."
Sherlock,2yvvmt,Boernii,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:46:48 2015 UTC,Where did you get this?
Sherlock,2yvvmt,archgallo,3,Fri Mar 13 12:23:28 2015 UTC,You can buy them here. Scroll down to the bottom for the sampler set. I want this so badly but their shipping costs to the EU are too damn high. :(
Sherlock,2yvvmt,old_mem,2,Fri Mar 13 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"If you're on the UK site, shipping to EU is <5euro   This is very tempting...  Edit: And free shipping over 50"
Sherlock,2yvvmt,archgallo,2,Fri Mar 13 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I didn't know they had the fandom teas on the European site as well, didn't see that last time. That shipping rate's not too bad I guess. Although the price seems to be quite a bit higher, $19 vs €32."
Sherlock,2yvvmt,old_mem,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:43:06 2015 UTC,I think it's only the Sherlock tea sampler that is higher - the other sets seem to be €18.
Sherlock,2yvvmt,Boernii,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:40:14 2015 UTC,40 bucks? That's ridiculous...
Sherlock,2yvvmt,pinguinos,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:12:48 2015 UTC,"Guess I'm not very informed when it comes to teas, but does Lestrade's really have gunpowder in it? That doesn't sound tasty or healthy."
Sherlock,2yvvmt,cphat,4,Fri Mar 13 16:33:19 2015 UTC,it's a reference to the flavors/tastes and notes present in the tea
Sherlock,2yvvmt,waffle_cat,2,Fri Mar 13 16:46:46 2015 UTC,Gunpowder is a variety of green tea.
Sherlock,2yvvmt,pinguinos,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Still a weird name for it though, imo."
Sherlock,2yvvmt,waffle_cat,2,Mon Mar 16 17:43:05 2015 UTC,It's called that because the tea leaves are rolled into pellets that resemble gunpowder.

Sherlock,2yvshl,Snuhmeh,4,Fri Mar 13 10:55:27 2015 UTC,I like this explanation. I also assumed the cabbie was right handed and kept his danger on the side he could keep track of subconsciously.
Sherlock,2yvshl,fernando_69,1 point,Fri Mar 13 10:56:37 2015 UTC,The Whelps that spawn from Dragon Egg are not to apply too much.

Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,4,Fri Mar 13 23:59:31 2015 UTC,I think I'll have to rewatch that scene episode season.
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:24:43 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it's Moriarty who's pulling the cabbie's strings. Both pills are poisoned. Now, whether or not that was the case for the past murders is a crapshoot, maybe the cabbie is bluffing, both were always poison and he just had the antidote, or maybe the cabbie did only have one poison pill and simply out-witted the four victims."
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:55:31 2015 UTC,Well Watson chooses the wrong building..
Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,4,Fri Mar 13 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take either. I have no reason to trust that either of those pills isn't poison, nor that the Cabbie provided any logical clues as to which would be which."
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,2,Fri Mar 13 22:39:44 2015 UTC,True. But if it was a real gun?
Sherlock,2yvshl,Lisu,3,Sat Mar 14 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"Then you stall, like Sherlock did, until something changes or an opportunity presents itself."
Sherlock,2yvshl,Lisu,2,Fri Mar 13 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"Sherlock didn't stall.  He played the game, using his own controller.  He won the game by playing by his own rules.   Edit: you can down vote all you want.  It just proves you know you're wrong"
Sherlock,2yvshl,ThinkingViolet,2,Fri Mar 13 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you, I didn't even see your post until now. We have no idea if Sherlock picked the right pill because the cabbie died before revealing the answer. There are no clues as to which pill is which, even when granted the baseless assumption that there exists a right pill, it's a coin toss."
Sherlock,2yvshl,frankieg49,2,Fri Mar 13 17:42:39 2015 UTC,I would have taken the one he handed me.
Sherlock,2yvshl,IsoSwaggyP,6,Fri Mar 13 18:09:19 2015 UTC,Mmm. I would have died of indecision. Aha.
Sherlock,2yvshl,frankieg49,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:05:01 2015 UTC,I am not smart enough to chose the right one though.  Sooo I would probably have just straight up died. xD
Sherlock,2yvshl,ThinkingViolet,2,Sat Mar 14 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"Neither of them! Sherlock had the upper hand! He knew he could get help if he needed it, he knew the cabbie was unarmed, and Sherlock has badass fighting skills that would be completely effective against an aging, ill, and relatively out-of-shape cabbie."
Sherlock,2yvshl,fracai,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:10:30 2015 UTC,Didn't the cabbie have a gun?
Sherlock,2yvshl,raava_,3,Fri Mar 13 10:56:19 2015 UTC,It was a fake gun.
Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,2,Fri Mar 13 12:00:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, right."
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:20:02 2015 UTC,That's true. What if it had been a real gun?
Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,2,Fri Mar 13 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"If it had been a real gun, I think Sherlock is clever enough to stall until help arrives or he can distract the cabbie, because the cabbie was the type of person that liked to show off too. I would do anything I could not to take either pill because there were too many unknowns."
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"That is true. Haha I just meant I was curious which pill people would choose (choose, not eat. Even Sherlock chose a pill)"
Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:53:49 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter; both poison.
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,2,Fri Mar 13 17:47:27 2015 UTC,So how'd the cabbie survive then if they were gonna take it at the same time?
Sherlock,2yvshl,AllThingsWillEnd,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:20:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps an antidote he took a few hours earlier? An immunity to the poison? Anything really.
Sherlock,2yvshl,athey,3,Sat Mar 14 20:13:05 2015 UTC,No way.  I refuse to believe the cabbie would cheat.
Sherlock,2yvshl,timewarp,-1,Fri Mar 13 05:50:04 2015 UTC,"Whether or not the cabbie would cheat is irrelevant, it's Moriarty who's pulling the cabbie's strings. Both pills are almost certainly poison, and the cabbie has no idea. Moriarty isn't going to rely on some random nobody to outwit Sherlock."
Sherlock,2yvshl,raava_,2,Fri Mar 13 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"Actually Moriarty does just that. He doesn't expect the Cabbie to attract Sherlock.  It never really mattered if Sherlock intervened, this was just a side job for Moriarty, not The Final Problem."

If she could figure out how to sell this in a build it yourself kit form she could ship it overseas. I'm sure it would do well.   If I had the time (or talent) I'd start a business like that.. Selling houses from movies and TV shows in dollhouse form.
Sherlock,2ym630,reddit_somewhere,2,Wed Mar 11 07:51:07 2015 UTC,"Jesus that's amazing...and that price seems super reasonable.  If your mom can workout how to ship overseas, I think she could make a ton on US sales."

Sherlock,2ybvkw,ingeniousHax0r,42,Sun Mar 8 11:35:04 2015 UTC,It's merely coincidence. Turing and Enigma are both rather famous and a good option for anyone wanting to slip in a little historical relevance into a script.
Sherlock,2ybvkw,bonly,19,Sun Mar 8 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I think at the moment the question of whether the Allies knew about the operation to bomb Coventry is still unanswered but historians are still arguing over it. Some say that Churchill was completely in the dark, others say that he knew the raid was coming but didn't know where it was going to happen - whilst others say that he did know but not from Enigma codes, but from other methods such as enemy navigation signals hours before the raid. There is a slim possibility that he knew from Enigma codes. The reason this operation was use in Sherlock was because it has a grain of truth and helps the story enormously - and it is a cool plot twist :)"

Sherlock,2ybvkw,Dotsmom,3,Sun Mar 8 17:46:24 2015 UTC,It was quoted because it really happened. It was a huge part of the strategy or else breaking enigma would have been nothing.
Sherlock,2ybvkw,ThisIsNotTokyo,3,Mon Mar 9 10:50:15 2015 UTC,Right I've seen the movie too. I just thought it was an interesting coincidence
Sherlock,2ybvkw,improbablesalad,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:02:24 2015 UTC,I agree it's a neat coincidence. Cryptonomicon (long partly-historical fiction book) has a few scenes with a different take on the problem of having information you want to act on without revealing you broke a code.

Sherlock,2y9i90,RealTwistedTwin,20,Sat Mar 7 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"I'll start off without going too wild. Tell me where I'm wrong.  In a private message if you really don't want to spoil anything  The coins, Euros. Clearly European. Chances are German. On the water bottle you can see the letters ""auer"". Not many languages where that would make a particularly large amount of sense so I'll go with what I presume to be the most likely option.  Judging by your mouse and keyboard you are a gamer. I'll refrain from commenting on the tissue box on your nightstand.  I'd say you are still living with your parents, maybe 19 years old. I'd have said early twenties but people at that age usually can't afford an apartment with that much space in a single bedroom.  Judging by the documents and writing utensils you're probably in university.  With anything I say, keep in mind that a real life Sherlock Holmes is sadly impossible. There isn't a hint to be found about each and every tiny detail about your life, no matter how well you look or observe.  And even if you find a hint. Sherlock always goes with the most probable explanation (according to Doyle's stories and books). It's extremely unlikely to be right so often if that is how you do it.   Edit: check out the law of truly large numbers if you disagree with my last point about Sherlock"
Sherlock,2y9i90,loomynartyondrugs,10,Sat Mar 7 19:19:41 2015 UTC,That's what I was hoping for ^ you are surprisingly close to the reality

Perfectionist, perhaps?  Intelligent, knowledgeable.  Slight fascination with 60's culture?"
Sherlock,2y9i90,Sharkbait_ooohaha,10,Sat Mar 7 20:29:52 2015 UTC,Those weights are not the mark of someone actually serious about being fit. More likely someone who likes the idea of it but hasn't put in the effort to actually get in shape.

However, the single monitor and computer that runs Vista would indicate the computer is either shared amongst the family or an old computer that OP's family gave them. The choice of computer hardware and desk means that OP has limited resources, and prioritized the devices you listed.

There have been a lot of guesses at German, but I think you are actually in Austria, seeing as you seem to have a bottle of Austrian mineral water and a sheet of paper with the logo for an Austrian based tile retailer. The book suggests physics, the typewritten paper suggests maths, so probably studying some combination of the two. And maybe an interest in travel or in other countries."

Sherlock,2y9i90,sherlucked,2,Sun Mar 8 08:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not very practiced at this, but let me take a few shots.  You share a bathroom, probably with your sibling, as I'm judging you are either in high school (the European equivalent if everyone else is correct) or just starting out in college. You are left handed, looking at the placement of you pens, reader, and the microphone on your headset, meaning you reach with that hand, so everything is more conveniently placed there and its not just because it was haphazardly set there since your computer is shoved over to the right side of the desk.   You have allergies judging by the two separate tissue holders in your room, one of them being a pocket pack, unless you make it a point to masturbate on the go.   You either don't work or only work part-time, I assume this because of your everything in one room set up, another reason I suspect you share your bathroom and live with your parents. You are athletic, but judging by the lack of trophies (I'm on mobile so I'm trying to do this from memory cuz I can't go back and forth so if I missed them, I'm sorry), you either only play team sports competitively or you aren't very good at solo sports...I can't remember any other details I can draw anything from yet, so I might add more as an edit in a bit.  This is a lot of fun!   Edit: I'm going to agree, you are totes German. You also sleep with your socks on and you play video games. I also want to venture that, while your parents might or might not be cool, they have some views that are, to you, fairly conservative, though they were probably a lot more liberal when they were your age. You are tidy, not just for these photos, and fastidious in the way you dress, even if your style has some casual elements to it.   You excel more in math and science than in art, and that's just the way you like it. Ummmmm...I can't pick anything else out at the moment. A lot of these ""observations"" also use a lot of speculation, so I wouldn't be surprised if I was horribly wrong. But I still wanna know lol. I should probably look farther in the comments to see if you'd told us or not..."
Sherlock,2y9i90,j_sunrise,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"Excellent, but you need to explain some things... My parents, conservative? Why would I sleep with my socks on?  Although you are wrong in some things, which I will explain later, you got many deductions right. Gamer, yes, currently working out due to my lack of fittness lately. I love science and Maths and wish to study at least one of those at university, I am at High School but I will be  finished by the end of mai. Living with my mum and living in a german-speaking country( austria)   You are wrong regarding the allergies, I just had a cold a few weeks ago and didn't use all of the tissues yet. Also, I am not left handed, I guess my desk set up is just massively inconvenient.   OK that's it, good job Mr.Holmes ; )"
Sherlock,2y9i90,j_sunrise,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:51:39 2015 UTC,"Lol cool. Your parents being more conservative than you was based on my assumption of your age. Your room is decorated in depictions of a nostalgic sort of past: the beetle, the construction workers and the keep calm poster, which can be construed (here in the US anyway) as a stereotypically liberal-minded way to decorate (sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'm kinda sleepy ATM). Since you're a teenager, I made the statistically sound assumption that you are even unconsciously rebelling in a light, playful way, against your parents, but seeing as how many traits we have are found to be genetic, it is very likely your parents were just like you in their teen years.   As for the socks thing, your floor is tile and unless you have heated floors, it probably gets cold as fuck in the night so getting out of bed is a bitch unless you wear socks. :)   A lot of wild assumptions on my part, but like I said, it was fun!"
Sherlock,2y9i90,IreneAdler54,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:06:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I might try the sock thing out one day, although we have heated floors my bed is a bit short so my feet are still getting cold sometimes :D  Also, now that I think about it ...

Sherlock,2y9i90,slamdunkbrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 8 10:39:17 2015 UTC,"Your right handed, eurpoean judging by the coins on the table. You don't seem to be living in a dorm, no the room is to large, perhaps a basement apartment that your renting.  You workout but not often. The weights are a reminder that you should and you may pick them up from time to time but your bench is more often used as a place to hold your dirty or clean clothes depending on the day. Obviously a gamer judging by the keyboard, gaming mouse and headphones, not cheap one either so this is more of a passion than a passing hobby.  You are a student, but not high school more likely college and early years. Your medals are not recent but more likely something you did very well when younger and are still proud of your achievement. I'd also say your single, with the chance of maybe going out on dates, but no realtionship, nothing left behind or female knick knacks or lady touches anywhere. Which also tells me your male judging by the decor. Your also a very neat and tidy person. Rooms this small it takes very little for things to get messy or the illusion of mess as anything out of place it very noticeable. Things are put away nicely, organized properly and current workings are front and present and stacked to order of use and importance.   How did I do? :D"
Sherlock,2y9i90,slamdunkbrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 21:58:27 2015 UTC,Great :D First one to mention that I got my medals early on. (I got them at elementary / middle school)

Sherlock,2y9i90,Christian_Vindy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:21:11 2015 UTC,"Tried to type this at a glance from each picture. Sorry for any negativity... was merely being as analytical as possible.   Weights are right on for a young male trying desperately to get muscle onto his body. Too much for most young females and their workouts, but too low for the average young male's workouts. Fits right in with the PC Gamer male. Not a serious competitive gamer either due to the mouse's design. Combined with the comfy headset for prolonged gaming sessions requiring active comms, I'd venture to say MMORPG is his game. I'd be willing to bet he's a World of Warcraft gamer.  On to the second picture. Room layout immediately screams out that he's living with parents. Room has to be kept decently tidy and no male would start decorating their bachelor pad with organized containers on a wall cubby. The carelessly placed mirror in the corner feeds into the new weightlifting mentality. A side table of what looks to be textbooks, homework assignment in German, and possibly a learning objectives sheet definitely suggest a young student. Either the an advanced high school student taking college courses or a college student commuting from his parents' home. With what appears to be a package of tissues next to the computer and going with the odds of him being a WoW gamer, he is single and views pornography at that computer which eliminates sharing the room with a roommate. Low lying bed and water bottle label help confirm someone residing outside of America.  On to picture 3. Albert Einstein poster is unusual but goes with the German and academia background. Two medals are clearly for academic merit from high school as they're too small and plain to be for high level sports. But they're the only accomplishments which the male can boast about at this point in his life. Just having them up in his room is further confirmation of residence at his parents. The other posters are all attempts at showing his artistic side with a focus on the  mid 20th century, but the use of tape to secure the posters reveals his sloppiness and youth. Bed appears to be made... either by parental rules or for his internet appearance is undetermined.   Final picture shows tiled flooring without a nonslip mat nearby also confirms the male is new to weightlifting. The sweats thrown onto the nearby chair shows he lives somewhere that's currently cool but not quite freezing in temperature. With the large cold front in the US, he has to be in Europe."
Sherlock,2y9i90,firemoo,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:37:29 2015 UTC,Everything right. I didn't even notice but apparently I kept the 2 posters my mum hang there because of my interest in art (possibly subconscious)

Sherlock,2y5k7a,FlashAndPoof,19,Fri Mar 6 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"I hear ya there!! Yeah I figured you were new to the show hehe. Between Hobbit, Imitation Game, Doctor Who, and other assorted projects, Sherlock kinda gets shoved to the back burner sometimes. But it's always worth the wait :)"
Sherlock,2y5k7a,The_Write_Knight,10,Fri Mar 6 19:22:45 2015 UTC,Yup. And now Doctor Strange... which is one that I'll gladly wait for. :)
Sherlock,2y5k7a,IntendoPrinceps,2,Fri Mar 6 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"The longest part of the wait is the script. Give the writers a long time to get the scripts perfect, then when it comes time to shoot, Benedict and Martin will more easily fall back into that roll and make the brilliant script into an even more brilliant reality."
Sherlock,2y5k7a,euricus,9,Sat Mar 7 07:37:43 2015 UTC,Just remember that you're essentially waiting for three new full-length films. The level of production on this series is higher than just about anything else on television.
Sherlock,2y5k7a,Radulno,1 point,Sat Mar 7 09:07:40 2015 UTC,"Game of Thrones has much more money thrown at it, I think it's just because of the BBC budget being stretched thin, and because big names like Benedict Cumberbatch get paid more for other projects in Hollywood."
Sherlock,2y5k7a,WiredEgo,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"The contracts are probably not the same by the way. GoT actors only take movies during the break periods and their GoT contract is apparently more important. I guess having regular shooting each year helps to plan though (they have less than Cumberbatch also).  But yeah, GoT has much more money in it and probably other shows. Even if Sherlock is of very high quality, it doesn't require that much budget I would think (sets, costumes, SFX are relatively simple to have since it's in our time and world). GoT is also at the max capacity with 10 episodes a season (more at the timing level than budget though : I guess HBO will give them as many dollars they need) but only because they impose themselves with returning each year around the same date.   Though a Sherlock season is only 6 episodes of a normal 50 minutes show so I think that's more due to Cumerbatch, Freeman and Moffat being occupied a lot elsewhere."
Sherlock,2y5k7a,Radulno,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that each episode is 90 minutes long, they're practically movies and in that sense a 1-2 year wait doesn't seem that long at all. Could you imagine if all three iron man movies came out within weeks of each other? (I personally think this is how they should do 2-part movies like mockingjay and deathly hollows)"
Sherlock,2y5k7a,Obi-Sam_Kenobi,4,Sat Mar 7 16:33:47 2015 UTC,That's not really movies though. That's the equivalent of 6 episodes of a normal TV show. TV works way faster than movies. That's more due to the actors and writers/producers other activities that pass sometimes before Sherlock.
Sherlock,2y5k7a,Nheea,7,Mon Mar 9 14:53:25 2015 UTC,Tbh the quality went down in season 3. I will still be watching season 4 though.
Sherlock,2y5k7a,Radulno,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:50:18 2015 UTC,But I thought that was because they were filming The Hobbit. I really hoped we'd have a new season this year.

Sherlock,2xkj5g,nintendo1889,107,Sun Mar 1 16:16:13 2015 UTC,Watson was mad because Sherlock didn't trust him. He did not reach out to him for TWO YEARS and left John go on mourning the loss of his best friend.  John was angry because Sherlock didn't trust him to keep a secret. Sherlock told Mycroft and a bunch of the Bake Street irregulars but he couldn't tell John?
Sherlock,2xkj5g,catdoctor,24,Sun Mar 1 17:03:18 2015 UTC,And his parents.
Sherlock,2xkj5g,_warlockja,16,Sun Mar 1 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"With all the people Sherlock told, it really made no sense to me that he wouldn't tell Watson too.  I mean Watson is a friggin doctor, he knows about confidentiality.  I just chop it up to the sloppy writing typical of the 3rd season"
Sherlock,2xkj5g,kittenmauler,53,Sun Mar 1 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone looks at this from their own perspective and never seems to look at it through Sherlock's.  John cannot lie effectively. Every time he has to lie, he's horrible at it. Look at the scene with the general from Episode 2. He's simply lying through omission and he's horrible at it. There's no way he would've been able to keep it secret, especially with the hounding he'd take from the press and police (who would've wanted multiple statements from him with two bodies).  Look at how Anderson reacts to his death. He pretty much nuts and had a breakdown. There's no way Anderson didn't bug the hell out of John trying to find out what happened. The only thing that kept him away probably was Lestrade flat out telling him to knock it off because of how bad John was. If John tried to ""act normal"", he wouldn't have put forward that kind of attitude and Anderson would've hounded him day and night. An experienced forensic detective, even an idiot like Anderson (remember, Sherlocks POV), would eventually find holes in the story.  The people he did tell wouldn't break. No one would expect Sherlock to use Molly in a scheme so wouldn't talk to her. Mycroft's life is pretty much keeping secrets. The members of the homeless network would be treated like drugged-out crazies just like Anderson.  One it was out, Sherlock's entire mission would be compromised. He wouldn't be able to move incognito anymore, and it wouldn't take long for what was left of Moriarty's network to find him if they knew he was alive. As it stands, they were chasing a ghost (in more ways than one). That's if they even bother looking instead of just going after John, Lestrade, Molly, and Mrs. Hudson again to draw him out.  John's emotional state wouldn't be on his mind because it wasn't part of the problem to ""solve""."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,Abstruse,18,Mon Mar 2 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. When Sherlock died and eventually was revealed to have been framed all eyes would've been on John for a very long time. He needed to act like someone whose best friend had just killed himself, without fail. Faking being sad wouldn't have been enough. Going back into therapy, starting to drink, moving on to a different place, falling in love, even growing the moustache were all part our his mourning and that kind of thing is very difficult to fake well enough that all the detectives around him who know him so well, the entire British press, and all of Moriarty's spies (who we know had been following them for months at least prior) would be fooled."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,jelliknight,42,Mon Mar 2 05:29:03 2015 UTC,"It's more than just confidentiality though. Maybe he thought John would want to help him if he knew he was alive and Sherlock couldn't allow that. It was too risky, and Sherlock knew he had to take down Moriarty alone."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,pixie_led,5,Mon Mar 2 01:06:07 2015 UTC,Yea that is actually a pretty good point.
Sherlock,2xkj5g,kittenmauler,3,Mon Mar 2 01:23:29 2015 UTC,I think it was more to just add a bit of drama. Not sloppy writing.
Sherlock,2xkj5g,BobbyGuthbert,2,Mon Mar 2 06:41:41 2015 UTC,"""sloppy writing"" by ACD then.  This is how the original story played out."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,NoSleepNomad,2,Mon Mar 2 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, ACD was a pretty fucking sloppy writer.  He forgot Mrs. Hudson's name."

Sherlock,2xkj5g,NoSleepNomad,4,Fri Mar 6 14:45:19 2015 UTC,And where John got shot
Sherlock,2xkj5g,Pokemonerd,31,Sat Mar 7 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Watson was mad that Sherlock didn't trust his ability to be discreet. Sherlock allowed Watson to grieve for 2 years because he thought Watson would go and blab to everyone that Sherlock was actually alive. I'd be upset in that situation, too.   It's worth noting that Watson's reaction to Holmes' return in the original stories is much more happy and grateful, and much less angry and annoyed."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,mandym347,14,Sun Mar 1 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that Watson's reaction to Holmes' return in the original stories is much more happy and grateful, and much less angry and annoyed.   If I recall correctly, in the books, Mycroft was the only one who knew; Holmes wouldn't have told him either, I think, except he needed Mycroft's help."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,sipawhiskey,8,Sun Mar 1 23:27:05 2015 UTC,This is true but I don't know if Sherlock didn't trust fearing he'd blab. He needed John to appear very mournful or it would be suspicious.
Sherlock,2xkj5g,lecuriousincident,2,Sun Mar 1 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"That might be true. I wonder how long the ""hit"" was on john for?"
Sherlock,2xkj5g,Throw-awy,10,Sun Mar 1 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think Sherlock is okay with coming back to London because he dismantled Moriarty's network (or at least, that's how it looks right now - who knows where series 4 is going to go). He probably feared that Watson could be taken out in retribution for Sherlock having not actually killed himself (as he was supposed to with his deal).   In order for his death to be 'real', Watson had to make it real for everyone else. If he had known that Sherlock wasn't actually dead, I'm not sure he would've been a good enough actor to make the world believe it."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,UnexpectedMedia,2,Mon Mar 2 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"He didn't tell Watson to protect him. With the exception of Mycroft (and the bums on the street that helped him) he didn't tell anyone that he cared about. I was also mad that he left his best friend out of the loop, but I then noticed that everyone in his circle of people he cared about was in the dark too. Quite simply, it was to protect them all."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,fr3ewritergurl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 07:01:03 2015 UTC,"It was in protection of the truth, if anyone was suspicious to Sherlocks death they would go to Watson for evidence and facts. Sherlock knew this, and thus had to convince him of his death, if Watson had the little inkle of evidence to suggest he knew Sherlock was alive, it would jeopardise the entire plan.  PLUS I'm also certain because Sherlock thought it was funny."
Sherlock,2xkj5g,polybius2,1 point,Mon Mar 2 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Sherlock knew hitmen were watching his loved ones as well as him, so he HAD to be convincing. There was no way of knowing how Moriarty would be on the roof, as brilliant as Sherlock was there was just no way for him to predict a specific reaction from someone that was just SOOOOOOO CHANGABLE!!! So since he knew he and his loved ones were being watched, there was just no way to let John know in time. And I think the comments about him not being able to act well enough are extremely valid too.   However there is a gap in my ""Sherlock was being watched"" theory. Unless what he told Anderson was true, that the hitmen were told to ""reconsider"" their actions, they would have seen him faking it. So there is that issue. But since we don't know what ACTUALLY happened, anything is possible.   As for why Sherlock didn't tell John he faked his death, I think it's briefly mentioned that Sherlock didn't know that John didn't know why. Sherlock probably thought it was blatantly obvious, as he thinks everything is. I think they may have had words about it in a scene we unfortunately didn't get to see, but somehow John came to terms with it and is ok."
