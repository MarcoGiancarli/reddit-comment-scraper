titanfall,3e29c6,tomharto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:59 2015 UTC,If you're going smart pistol AI farming you'll want to go suppressor to ensure your shots don't light you up on the minimap. It makes you less effective against pilots however.   The alternative is enhanced targeting which will help with faster kills all-around but at the cost of showing up on the minimap when you shoot.
titanfall,3e29c6,PM_ME_LEGAL_PAPERS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:39 2015 UTC,No prob. I an used to fighting pilots. I would go with the Enhanced targeting for sure.

Make use of your burn cards - and buy daily deals and packs that will help - and stick to the mode you're best at.  Play Campaign. There's usually always a bunch of low level players in there.  BTW, does coming first in a Frontier Defense match not count towards MVP? That would be an easy way to do it if it counts."
titanfall,3e29c6,ManWithYourPlan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. The only time I have played Frontier Defense was when I was trying to get my Plasma Cannon Critical hits, so I wasn't using a fast/aggressive loadout that allowed me to slaughter the grunts and spectres.   Now that I have met the Regen requirement, I am going to go with the 40mm Cannon and Guardian chip. My plan is to Embark on the Titan when battling Titans and then disembark so I can kill Grunts and Spectres as my Titan is in ""follow mode"" with the guardian chip.  I think that should help get me some better final scores."
titanfall,3e29c6,Kush-proGoD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:52 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna play Attrition I would recommend the arc cannon, cos it's a solid weapon against titans and pilots but it will also kill a group of grunts or spectres in one shot. I'd say you want to stay in your titan if you want to be more effective. Use minion detector too, so you can see where all the AI are at all times."

titanfall,3e3bbh,Dusterfox,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:51 2015 UTC,Has been done (among other games) in Dust 514 and is not something the developers should waste their time on. It's nothing but a gimmick you might like doing once and even then it's not really fun.
titanfall,3e3bbh,bifud,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"I can see it working in single player, much like how the Ghostbusters game went about introducing the next stage."
titanfall,3e16dg,SigmaTheDJ,7,Tue Jul 21 04:04:42 2015 UTC,this was tried already with ShadowRun on the 360. PC players always won out. i rather not deal with getting krabered constantly by PC players.   thanks.
titanfall,3e16dg,digital-atheist,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"ShadowRun   Yeah, that's because you had no choice but to be matched up against PC players using a keyboard and mouse."
titanfall,3e16dg,digital-atheist,0,Tue Jul 21 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"ok, so why would you want to? What's the incentive? I think that's a lot of resources wasted that could be better placed elsewhere.   If it were as easy as hitting a switch then sure, why not. But i know it's not, it takes a lot of code, a lot of balancing.  Not to mention the movement speed of SR was not that much faster from console to PC. Titanfall is a shit ton faster on PC than on console. The disadvantages for a console player would be two fold."
titanfall,3e16dg,digital-atheist,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:54 2015 UTC,"ok, so why would you want to? What's the incentive?   Bigger userbase. It wouldn't matter if your friends were on PC or console.  MS are opening up cross-platform play/functionality in Windows 10 to allow any devs to make games that can be played across PC and Xbox One where it makes sense. Obviously, it doesn't make sense to just throw everyone into the same FPS if there are no filters that players can use, because the high end PC teams using keyboard and mouse are going to win, but if I could say ""match me up only with people using controllers"", I wouldn't care if they were on PC or Xbox. Obviously there are coding challenges involved with it, but they can be solved. I did say that this was a hypothetical situation though, rather than something I think they will - or should - do."
titanfall,3e16dg,digital-atheist,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:01 2015 UTC,i see what you're saying. if that is something microsoft takes time and creates and puts in place then sure but right now i rather Respawn focus on making TF 2 the best game possible.
titanfall,3e16dg,bicranium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although I think it would be cool if it didn't matter what system you were using. I'd love to see Xbox One, PS4 and PC players be able to play with/against each other, as long as I could block out keyboard and mouse users if I wanted to.  In fact, just Xbox One and PS4 cross-platform play would be fine. That's even less likely to happen than Xbox One/PC, lol, but it would be cool. It might even save Respawn some hassle when it comes to dealing with servers, as if the PS4 version of the game doesn't use Azure, then they will either have to come up with a separate solution for PS4 players or abandon Azure altogether and use their own servers, which is something I don't want to see happening."

titanfall,3e16dg,pulley999,7,Tue Jul 21 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"A couple months after Titanfall came out the best competitive team on Xbox played a tournament on PC using controllers.  The PC teams all figured they were just doing it for novelty and they'd be an easy out but they made it to the semifinals before a PC team (with one of the organizers of the tournament on it) more or less cheated them out of a win.  After that controllers were actually banned from being used in competitive PC tournaments because all the PC people figured the only reason the Xbox players were competitive was because the aim assist with the controller is so strong it's basically a low-level aimbot.  I'm not going to go into why one side or the other was right or wrong but the point is people with controllers on this game, not a game 7-8 years ago, were able to compete just fine with mouse and keyboard players on PC."
titanfall,3e16dg,HoldenMyD,4,Tue Jul 21 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, i remember that and i saw some vids of that. Both teams kind of sucked to be honest. The game was too new. And wasn't the PC teams not even really TF competitive teams?   Anyways, it doesn't matter. There will be players that can ""compete"" but on average PC will always win. I didn't get crushed by PC players in the days of SR but i knew right away when someone was on it. Their head shots were just so much better."
titanfall,3e16dg,ElixirFire,5,Tue Jul 21 08:12:11 2015 UTC,"the PC teams in the tournament were the top teams in the game, My team South Mouth won, we never got to play Exertus Zen... but yeah we quit titanfall after that tournament.  Came back months ago and won every tournament we've participated in.  Xertus Xen were some really great players.  They abused the Arc Cannon which no other team was doing and it worked out magnificently.  ps. the aim assist is disgusting which was proven by the gifs created of sager/gigglemonster   (not to take away from their abilities in general)"
titanfall,3e16dg,Trematode,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:55 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, I can't use the RE-45 for my life, the recoil makes is too difficult for me to track targets. I always run P2011 or Wingman depending on my loadout.  I cheesed the gen4 requirement with a gamepad in a couple matches, despite having not used a controller *(For FPS, had one for driving sims) for the better part of 3 years while using KBM daily.  The aim assist is too damn strong. It felt wrong to hit LT and watch my crosshair snap 8o up and to the left to hit someone, and keep tracking them with all but the vaguest of inputs on my part."
titanfall,3e16dg,HoldenMyD,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"The aim assist is so strong I can own people with a controller on pc. It's so unfair, you don't have to be very good for it, but I'm sure being good helps"
titanfall,3e16dg,ElixirFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"ok? if you're really good you should be able to own people not as good as you. But if you go up against someone as good, or even slightly lower than you that is using kb/mouse you will most likely lose."
titanfall,3e16dg,Trematode,3,Tue Jul 21 08:24:25 2015 UTC,"You might think that, but it really depends on the scenario. If you get a straight up encounter where sustained tracking fire occurs the aim assist confers a huge advantage. You'll get mediocre players killing some of the higher skilled mouse and keyboard players, easily."
titanfall,3e16dg,kylpama3,3,Tue Jul 21 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Id say I'm pretty good with both KBAM and controller, but I beat people that I wouldn't beat with KBAM if I'm playing on a controller in certain situations. The aim assist is crazy"
titanfall,3e16dg,digital-atheist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:24 2015 UTC,your movement should trump those advantages.
titanfall,3e16dg,kylpama3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"That's the thing -- you can't evade their aim when the aim-assist is locked on to you. You can move around all you want (lots of good players are pretty effective at making themselves a hard target to hit by strafing rapidly or by moving in otherwise unexpected ways), but it won't help as much vs. someone using a controller."

titanfall,3e16dg,Trematode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:23 2015 UTC,"This is not the case -- on the PC side you often get players that may be mediocre in terms of their situational awareness, and/or positioning persevering through encounters they would not have lived through if they didn't have aim assist. It's aggravating being on the receiving end, especially when you see the perfect tracking in the killcams indicating what is essentially a built-in aimbot."
titanfall,3e16dg,ElixirFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"when you see the perfect tracking in the killcams   Haha as if killcams are even remotely accurate  Anyways, if you can't stomp the scrubs that we stomp all the time, maybe K&M isn't so superior"
titanfall,3e16dg,Trematode,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you've got any experience with mouse and keyboard in this game or others, so I'll just chalk that comment up to lack of experience... For someone to track with a mouse at high speed, with the target evading is no small thing -- minute changes in their perceived direction can easily cause you to over correct.  It can be very apparent in the killcams that a controller users reticle will snap to target and remain glued to its centermass effortlessly while the target tries in vain to throw the aim off by juking or changing directions.   Without aim-assist, it can be very hard to keep your reticle so permanently fixed to your target as you're constantly trying to compensate for their small random movements, their reactions, and your own movement. You've also got things like visual recoil to second guess as it changes the visual position of your reticle on the screen.  If you're stomping aim-assisted scrubs, with your own aim-assist, congratulations: Your bot beat their bot. You are one step away from dueling with smart pistols."

titanfall,3dwwtw,OrganikSkillz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:52:54 2015 UTC,I played frontier defense to practice getting use to b-hopping correctly.
titanfall,3dwwtw,Everawrdo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:39:34 2015 UTC,I trained myself as I played.   I never did solo training.
titanfall,3dwwtw,ManWithYourPlan,0,Mon Jul 20 11:51:19 2015 UTC,You should try to do it in the real games. That's how I went about learning everything.

titanfall,3dvzti,SOT-NumberNine,6,Mon Jul 20 00:18:12 2015 UTC,I got this GTX 980 price matched. :)  http://www.microcenter.com/product/438838/geforce_gtx_980_superclocked_4gb_pcie_video_card
titanfall,3dvzti,SOT-NumberNine,4,Mon Jul 20 00:32:36 2015 UTC,Oh did u get that insane $250 deal? I tried like 5 places but apparently every retailer in my area is smart :(
titanfall,3dvzti,Mike-MI7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, got in early so it was more likely to happen. I got shot down by Staples, but Office Depot did it. :)  It really comes down to luck with these things.  If anyone wants to try it, the link still has the price so it might be doable."
titanfall,3dvzti,Mike-MI7,8,Mon Jul 20 00:37:46 2015 UTC,Did you tell the salesperson about your rare encounter with a black-greek person?

titanfall,3dvzti,metalface187,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:08 2015 UTC,When did you go get the deal? I tried Friday but best buy cleared their inventory and apparently office max stopped selling cards.
titanfall,3du0p5,SnoopTidder,9,Sun Jul 19 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"I bought it for PC a few months ago, instantly loved it. However, Witcher 3 came along and sucked me in. During that time (after e3) I got a sweet deal on an Xbox one so I finally bit. I bought EA Access to play BF4 and have other games but since they added titanfall I have pretty much played it nonstop. In spite of it having less visual candy and some screen tearing I feel it's more fun on the console version. ( I have some people to play with and live is more social than origin.) I even paid the $12 when it was on sale to own it outright.  TL;DR Buy it on either platform or get EA Access. It's super fun!"
titanfall,3du0p5,arachnicide,7,Sun Jul 19 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"There's something about Titanfall that had me addicted. I don't have much free time but even when I buy a new game, I always end up back on Titanfall at 1am for 'one last match.' :)"
titanfall,3du0p5,PlanB_is_PlanA,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"I love when you jump in the Titan and that British chick voice says ""Titan Online."" Gives me shivers."
titanfall,3du0p5,sindelpellion,5,Sun Jul 19 22:45:09 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Titanfall consistently since the beta and, even though it's had its issues, the game has always been solid. Fun. Gripping. Frustrating as hell sometimes. I have no idea why it doesn't get the love it very clearly deserves.  Origin ID and Reddit username, along with pretty much everything else, are the same. I'll play with you. :)"
titanfall,3du0p5,N3WM4NH4774N,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:00 2015 UTC,Setup your flair with your Origin ID
titanfall,3du0p5,I_Am_Gotham,2,Sun Jul 19 16:05:09 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll figure it out :)
titanfall,3du0p5,kylpama3,2,Sun Jul 19 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"I have been debating whether I should buy this game or Evolve for Xbox One. This just made it harder for me to decide, as I really want both. ;)"
titanfall,3du0p5,I_Am_Gotham,10,Sun Jul 19 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"for what it's worth, i have both and have around 10 hours in evolve and over 1000 in titanfall (both purchased at release)."
titanfall,3du0p5,MikeyBlunt,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"Just one question: Is the Xbox One community still pretty active in Titanfall? That's my main concern, not finding/being able to complete a full game."
titanfall,3du0p5,bury_the_hatchet,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"way more alive in titanfall than in Evolve, but if you are going Xbox One I would suggest buying a year or month of EA Access, it comes with Titanfall, BF4, Plants vs Zombies, and a ton of other sports games!"
titanfall,3du0p5,Ozzymandiaas,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"8000+ concurrent users on at peak  all playlists usually have 200+ people in them when it's busy, and even when it's 2am on the west coast I still find lobbies to play all the time  plus there's a decent custom game community, we play a lot of CTF but there's crewsjavascript:void(0) that play LTS and even Marked for Death with some regularity  there's lots of matches to be played. You won't run into issues with finding/completing matches unless you live in asia"
titanfall,3du0p5,FlyLo760,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:36 2015 UTC,Same here
titanfall,3du0p5,kylpama3,6,Sun Jul 19 22:13:47 2015 UTC,You will definitely get more replay value out of titanfall
titanfall,3du0p5,MikeyBlunt,2,Sun Jul 19 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"the only game i have that is newer than titanfall in which i do have a fair amount of time is, sunset overdrive (which i have around 30 hours)... any other game i have played hasn't made it above 10 (that's being generous)..."
titanfall,3du0p5,Fizzyface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:06 2015 UTC,Don't get Evolve... horrible servers and just overall is not as fun as Titanfall! I got it day one and haven't been back in a while but Titanfall is way more fun in my opinion
titanfall,3du0p5,GOU_NoMoreMrNiceGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:40 2015 UTC,This is the one xbox one game I keep coming back to. I only paid around £7 for the game then all the DLCs went free so what a bargain.
titanfall,3du0p5,Trematode,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"i fucking hate this game because it is subject to the vicissitudes of player numbers and match making....  just give me bots for fuck's sake.  when it became clear that i could not get into a came without seeing an unbreakable team of gen 10's on the other side with a two players on mine and everyone just waiting around for our side to get additional randoms, it earned my eternal enmity.  i know some of you play with friends and want to stay a team.  fuck you.  if there isn't enough players to fill out a game break your fucking team to smithereens.  is it so much fun for you when you're stomping the shit out of random gen 3 players who are not coordinating at all?  if i had my way, they'd make a separate lobby just for people who aren't on teams and don't want to talk to fucking 15 yo strangers on a headset.  or pure deathmatch free for all.  can't remember the amount of times when i just wished i could ""just fucking play"".  fuck titanfall. and if titanfall 2 is as limiting in single player options, i am going to give a wide fucking berth should it ever manifest."
titanfall,3du0p5,GOU_NoMoreMrNiceGuy,7,Mon Jul 20 00:37:24 2015 UTC,"Have an upvote. You have a very valid point, and the fact that there is no way to voluntarily switch to a weaker, or smaller team is one of the major fuckups respawn has yet to fix.  But you've also missed out on what is arguably the best multiplayer shooter in the last 15 years because you were too butthurt."
titanfall,3du0p5,Trematode,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:33 2015 UTC,thanks but i missed out not because i was butthurt but because the system made it impossible for me to have a consistently good experience.
titanfall,3du0p5,LifeWulf,4,Mon Jul 20 03:33:27 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for teaching me the word vicissitudes, anyway."
titanfall,3du0p5,GOU_NoMoreMrNiceGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:34 2015 UTC,Serious question: why are you in the Titanfall sub if you hate Titanfall so much?
titanfall,3du0p5,drk_evns,0,Mon Jul 20 02:43:09 2015 UTC,just never unsubscribed.  and it entertains me to unleash my hate and bile every now and again.  and maybe it will help tf2 be less of a rage maker.
