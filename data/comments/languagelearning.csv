I sort of hear a Portuguese accent, so I tell my coworkers, ""go ahead, I got this.""  And so I start talking to him in Portuguese and he gets the biggest smile on his face because he found someone with whom he could communicate easily. Then his wife asks him, what's up? He replies, in Italian, ""Oh, this guy speaks Portuguese."" And I'm just thinking, ""Wait--this dude's Italian?!""  So, here is this non-Italian speaking dude, communicating with this old Italian man who can't speak English, in Portuguese. In a world where English is the connecting language, these two guys are using a different language to communicate with each other easily.

I didn't speak Russian at the time, they didn't speak English, which made things fun. So there we were, all squashed into this little jeep and not really knowing what to do, and so to get rid of the boredom I pulled out my copy of Le Monde (French newspaper). The daughter of this family got really excited and I then discovered she spoke French virtually fluently. We ended up all chatting quite nicely, with the daughter as translator.   On the same trip, I'd gone to a local supermarket for something, when a black couple approached me, speaking what sounded like some African language. I tried to see if they spoke English, which they didn't to any real standard, and so I took a stab at guessing that if they didn't speak English, they might speak French, or at least understand it. This worked well, as they switched from their first language to French and I was able to give them the directions they needed. Turns out they wanted to know where I'd found the supermarket. They seemed overjoyed that I could help them.   On a different trip, this time in Italy, I was staying in a hostel close to the main train station in Rome. Every morning saw me go to the train station to the newsagent there (it was the nearest one) and buy newspapers. I was there one morning walking back to the hostel with my copy of Le Sport (French sports paper) when a man approached me and asked me if I could help him in Italian. I explained in Italian I didn't speak the language, but I then held up the paper and asked if he spoke French.

languagelearning,3e2b6s,hodex,22,Tue Jul 21 12:21:06 2015 UTC,"I think mnemonics tend to work like scaffolding during construction. They help during the building process, but they're taken down after construction. During speech, recall needs to happen so quickly there's no time for anything other than automatic recall... as a word gets used more and more, you'll naturally start dropping everything but the word itself and it's natural associations and connotations. It takes dozens (hundreds?) Of times using and seeing a word in various contexts for it to get automatic, so as much help as you can get between the first time you see a new word and the hundredth time you correctly use it, the better."

While this isn't an issue as much with languages that have a strict phono-ortho tie, it was definitely very helpful for Chinese because there's absolutely no clue at all going from the spoken word to the written.  I still remember some of them, but even in writing I rarely have to use them. What I did was just go through the etymology of the word and ones that didn't really 'click' with me were the ones I created mnemonics for.   Remember that mnemonics don't have to be a sing-songy type thing, most of mine were little stories. Like the word 接 which means 'to pick up (a person from a place)' has the radical for hand on the left, and concubine on the right. So I just remember that when I go pick up my concubine, I should hold her hand.   This really accelerated my learning too, because it made it much easier to break apart new words that I learned much in the same way a native speaker does."

If it's in your active vocab with automatic recall you don't even think of the mnemonic.  I don't use mnemonics anymore, but they were a big help when trying to connect a word/symbol to something I could relate to. In my opinion, when you've got a good base in a language you can just connect it to other parts of the language a lot more passively."

Just say you want an American Accent.  Of the American Accents you probably want a Hollywood Accent which is standard and unadorned, everything else comes with baggage.  I don't know why you want the accent but it can be advantageous to have a Posh British accent because Americans associate it with intelligence."

And just 10 years ago, Bayard et al. (2001) found that American accents were more positively evaluated in New Zealand and Australia, and America.  You might not be able to read the graph, but that dotted line at the top represents the North American accent, as spoken by a woman. Below that is North American male. Leaving third place to....Australian men! Yes, the English accent (as spoken by a man) is way down in 4th place now.   My preferred way of interpreting this (a bit tongue-in-cheek) is that Americans are happy to rate the English as more intelligent than themselves up until they actually start meeting and talking to the English   So in other words, Americans have more self-esteem towards their own accent(s) than before.

They have more detailed stories about certain subjects which can sometimes take about half an hour or more. It will go fast, so try to download the podcast and loop certain parts.  I don't know what you want to improve on, but i'm going give you some advice:   Reading: read dutch articles and translate them to your language. You can do this mentally or by taking a piece of paper and translating the whole article.  Translating: take an english article and translate it into dutch. Make sure you analyse each word group and use a grammar + dictionary to start translating. It will take you some time but it's a matter of finding patterns in your sentence to know ""That should be in this tense"". Sentence structure is a bit different because you learn it by reading imo."
languagelearning,3e1nm4,Quof,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Dutch in particular, but I generally avoid translating in language learning, as every language is unique and associating between two languages (by, for example, translating) seems to impair naturally understand one language to a certain degree... Which is to say, rather than translating Dutch -> English and then English -> Dutch, I think it'd be better to naturally produce in Dutch -> Naturally read in Dutch, no translation involved. Just understanding."

If you don't know how to form the tense + don't know the words straight out of your head you're going to have a difficult time in the beginning. After a time it becomes a habit to think in the language you want to learn.  I do agree that after a certain period you will do it more naturally. I've been studying french for a long time and I first studied it this way, preparing my text before I wrote something and now I can write and speak more naturally in french without any help tools."

It can be difficult from the beginning (and you might have to go the translation way first) but after a time it should become a habit.  Sidenote: once you start writing a full dutch sentence and you can't find the word, write it down in your own language and try to find it (make sure it also fits in the sentence according to the structure that we use). I do this a lot when I'm writing in french."

One thing i do struggle with when it comes to writing is getting the correct grammar and as you say, the order of words too.

Once you've solidified your native language (even if you haven't fully mastered it) everything after that is an L2, and most kids have their L1 pretty solid by the time they're enrolled in grade school. If you want that L1 advantage I'd suspect you've gotta get at them when they're still in nursery school."

languagelearning,3e1rhx,billigesbuch,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC from my college linguistics class, a child will likely continue making the same mistakes even after being explicitly corrected.  My guess is that this happens because speaking is a pretty unconscious process most of the time, as in you don't consciously focus on how to conjugate a verb every time you say it.  So even if you're consciously aware of an error, if you're speaking quickly, you can still easily make that error.  Fun fact: at least in English, children tend to master irregular plurals first.  Then, when they learn regular plural formation, they start to form irregular plurals incorrectly, using the regular rule (mans instead of men).  Then, they get their competence in irregular plurals back. (That's how I remember it anyway, I'll have to check my textbook when I get home to make sure)."

Whether it makes a difference in the short term doesn't matter much for the overall learning. As I go look at articles for this I think I'm confusing the question a bit. I don't believe there's any evidence for telling children they're wrong. There's certainly plenty of feedback, some of which is effectively correcting them, e.g. rebracketing what they're saying and what not."
languagelearning,3e1rhx,Umbrall,4,Tue Jul 21 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"as and esl teacher in Taiwan I've found the students I have that started learning English from preschool communicate much more fluidly than those that started later, however they are very frustrated with the small details of grammar rules. I can talk to them about any subject but they think their English is bad because they forget to conjugate verbs or mix up subject object pronouns, have trouble spelling, etc; then they get bad test scores. Some of them give up and fall behind once their language is tested.   The other students who usually start in second grade or later eventually develop an impeccable knowledge of how the language works, and their written work is perfect. They tend to test much better than the students that learned from preschool. However they have a lot of trouble constructing sentences at a normal conversational speed and always second guess themselves, because  the other kids seem to speak so much more fluently than them.   Sure, this might just be a problem of the curriculums that my company offers, but maybe also how rigid testing affects the students self-perceived abilities and contributes to learned helplessness.     okay, now i just watched the video. seems pretty similar to what i've observed. I think they're failing to also incorporate how testing affects the early starters who may have developed bad habits that are allowed to slide as they're so young, later affects their self image and motivation.  It reminds me of a student who in preschool/kindergarten was top of his class before reading and writing was necessary. one year later in the first grade, he could communicate just as well but was at the bottom of the class and showed a lot of symptoms of dyslexia. There are cultural taboos about this sort of thing here so the parents refused to give it any credence. A year later he had completely given up and his English has regressed to less than his preschool levels. He's become the class clown as that's his only source of validation.   tl;dr: I think the problem isn't just with how early you start but how it's taught and tested."

languagelearning,3e1rhx,WillAlwaysLie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:09 2015 UTC,"Yup! This has been proven several times in Canadian language classes.   Basically, the logic behind it is that language classes a few times a week don't really provide enough practice to attain fluency anyway. Whereas young children tend to learn better than older ones if they live in the country where the language is spoken, this doesn't seem to show up in a foreign-language class. On the contrary, older children learn much faster, because they can apply their far superior problem-solving skills and experience with the world.   Eventually, those who started earlier and those who end up starting later all end up in the same class, where the teacher caters to the level of the weakest students, and all differences tend to equal themselves out.   So the takeaway is, if you want your students to sound like natives in the new language, bite the bullet and give them an immersion experience. If you're okay with a slightly lower level, you may want to start language classes later, because starting them early could just end up wasting resources."

I know that every one else in Ontario who didn't care about French class now knows practically zero French thanks to the passage of time, but I personally found it helpful.   I took the curriculum-mandated Grade 4-9 and then electively took it until Grade 12.

languagelearning,3dy7qv,krnm,8,Tue Jul 21 05:21:56 2015 UTC,"From my amateur perspective, the solution seems pretty straightforward; use the language to get a feeling for the words and how they're used.    I suppose the bigger question is where students get the idea that other languages are 1-to-1 counterparts with English.  It seems like that would be pretty obvious from the beginning when you greet people by saying ""Good days"" (""buenos días"") and ""How do you call yourself?"" (""¿Cómo se llama?"")  My only guess is that this is a side effect of trying to memorize and repeat vocabulary for exams, where there generally is only one right answer.  Of course, I don't know where the author is getting his students, so a guess is all I can manage."
languagelearning,3dy7qv,Luguaedos,23,Mon Jul 20 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"I have had this issue before with some beginners. The issue is really a low tolerance for ambiguity. Usually these are people who are studying the language because they feel they have to learn it; either professionally or for some other external reason. But it's not unusual for some kids to be overly dogmatic because they suffer from the notion that the book is correct and if it's not in the book it's wrong. Most adults get past that obviously false notion. But some adults don't want to be learning and resist what they feel are stupid complications that are making their lives needlessly difficult. I remember I had a student named Fernanda, she was in her late 40s at the time. But when we started learning about homophones and homonyms she nearly threw a 2 year-old style temper-tantrum in class. I mentioned that Portuguese has plenty of them as well and she said with a sour face, ""Is not the same, teacher."" It's not the same because she learned all of those different meanings in her native language a really long time ago. And now she fells like she's an idiot because learning a new language is hard work that she doesn't want to do and her self-worth is tied to her performance.  There are people who think, ""I'm smart because things are easy for me."" Which means that the reverse must also be true, ""I'm dumb because things are hard for me."" If you combine that attitude with learning a language the person doesn't really want to, and you get this type of behavior. Those are the folks who never make it past the advanced beginner level and switch from method to method thinking it's not them that's the problem, the just have to find the right course, the right method, or the right teacher. They never get that the issue is in them. All they have to do is relax, accept ambiguity as a natural part of learning a language, and see learning failures as opportunities and not as moral failures."

It's no wonder they have trouble with ambiguity - they are schooled out of accepting it!"
languagelearning,3dy7qv,prium,8,Mon Jul 20 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"Well for a monolingual beginner, those aren't sentences that they have to deconstruct. They will think ""what is your name"" is ""como te llamas"", not ""como"" is ""how"", ""te"" is ""yourself"" and ""llamas"" is ""call"". So in their mind it is still 1 to 1. They are often taught these phrases before any grammar, so they never think about them again. The issue comes in when they have to start understanding a new sentence on the fly, or even come up with one themselves."
languagelearning,3dy7qv,reagansdeathsquads,3,Mon Jul 20 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"This is why it's always better to, as soon as you grasp the basics, learn a language within that language. Look up words within that language, have native language speakers explain things to you using their own words. Language isn't a science, especially learning it second hand. It's getting a feel for things within a cultural context, and fluency means triggering a part of your brain that thinks in that language rather than translating, regardless of how many words or phrases you may or may not know."

languagelearning,3dy7qv,dwana49,3,Tue Jul 21 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"I have actually had younger learners argue with me that a particular verb can't possibly mean Y because the book says it means X*.     I totally did this in high school Spanish. My teacher tried to say ""estamos en la feria"" to mean ""we are at the fair."" I quick looked up ""at"" in the glossary of our book, raised my hand, and showed her that the word for ""at"" was ""a"" and it should be ""estamos a la feria.""  I was really into correcting my teachers. I'm frankly impressed that any of them could put up with me."

languagelearning,3dywc8,Norrius,7,Tue Jul 21 07:00:24 2015 UTC,The Chinese there is specifically written Mandarin. Saying it's Chinese is a misnomer that marginalizes other dialects.
languagelearning,3dywc8,Umbrall,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:54 2015 UTC,Great point! (Though I would say that calling them 'dialects' marginalises them just as much...)
languagelearning,3dywc8,Mr_kucing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:16:04 2015 UTC,Everything's a dialect. It's easier for me to call them all dialects than try to address political issues with people.
languagelearning,3dywc8,Umbrall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"Of course - there is no linguistic definition for what is a dialect, but it's all about perception, and if people hear the varieties of Chinese referred to as dialects, everything that isn't Mandarin gets marginalised, in just the same way as if people call Mandarin 'Chinese', like you were saying in your original comment."

languagelearning,3dygcc,ActingAustralia,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"Well, some conlangs are spoken by a lot of people while others are simply on paper projects. For instance, Esperanto started out as a created language and now has a massive speaker base across the world and even has representatives at UNESCO. Not something a lot of natural languages can claim.  But really, I don't see the point of hating on a language just because of it's origin. Then again, people generally don't like or accept things they don't understand so it's only natural to fight back. Not that it really matters or makes a difference to those communities. For instance, Esperanto speakers have been prosecuted and killed because of their language, yet the language lives on and grows every year in size. A few internet trolls and haters won't stop that anytime soon."
languagelearning,3dygcc,jiangyou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:26 2015 UTC,"Then again, people generally don't like or accept things they don't understand so it's only natural to fight back.   Good to know we are both immune to criticism. I don't hate on constructed languages. I am just critical. A lot of the concepts in this language (I did skim through that ~70 lessons pdf) are something speakers of Western languages can also experience with learning Chinese, just to name one. Granted, the thousands of characters and word groups in Chinese don't compare to the 123 words of Toki Pona.  I get why the simplicity of this language might be intriguing to people. But I personally would rather invest the countless hours one needs to learn a language into learning languages that have more culture behind them and that don't confine me in a vocabulary that fits on a piece of paper the size of a credit card.  If the aim is to see how a language copes with what is basically a lack of words, then this is a fun language for sure. But I doubt it is suited for practical use in any way. Not in this stage, anyhow. Also, I think the practical use of most natural languages exceeds the use of most constructed ones.  TL;DR: Haters gonna hate."
languagelearning,3dygcc,ActingAustralia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:39 2015 UTC,"Well, most people learning languages like Toki Pona already know several languages. I don't speak Toki Pona (I've also skimmed through it) but it's a very new language and has an active following. Who knows where it will be in a 100 years. Dead or alive doesn't really matter. It's upside is quick learnability it's downside is ambiguity.  Culture is also something developed over time. That's why Toki Pona doesn't have it, while Chinese and Esperanto do. Although Chinese culture is thousands of years old and Esperanto culture is only 150 years old."

languagelearning,3e13y7,OsakaWilson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Japanese is ranked as a very difficult language for English speakers and it is true. It will take 4X the time to learn an equal amount of Norwegian or Spanish. I know you can do the math, but that means that eight years rather than the typical two years. It is a huge investment. I've spent my adult life learning Japanese.   Had I known how difficult it was, I'm not sure if I would have chosen it. The good point is that not so many people become really good at it, so once you do, you stick out. Just know that a relationship with Japanese is VERY high maintenance.   I also spent several years learning ASL. I loved it and still think it is a fantastic language. However, after working on it hours a day and only meeting one person who uses it (I live in Japan), I stopped. It is still really useful when a member of my family and I are on separate sides of glass (happens more often than you'd think) or want to communicate across a noisy room. If you plan to get into B or C levels, you're going to need some interaction with real users of a language. Keep that in mind.   My suggestion is Esperanto. It is several times easier than other ""easy"" languages. I often hear that you learn it 4X faster than other languages, but I have not seen any data on that, though people tend to learn it much, much faster than other languages. You get a big payoff quickly. If you give it just six months (of serious work), you should be very functional. At that point, you'll really know whether you want to go for full fluency. And if you choose not to, you haven't lost much."

The most important fact to emphasize is that people overestimate their levels, out of ignorance, arrogance, or shame just the psychological bias which I can't remember that leads to over-self evaluation. The good thing about CEFR is its base in competencies and not knowledge. A person can, with honest introspection, can know their level by just thinking about what they can do or not do. Recently I changed my flair in Spanish from C1 to B2 because reveiewing the tables I thought it was more appropriate - even though I speak exclusively in Spanish to my partner."

languagelearning,3dvt1r,itsudatte,2,Mon Jul 20 01:11:44 2015 UTC,"these tests are a lot more difficult than you would think.   Some of them are, but it does depend on the test. The JLPT for example is quite a bit easier than most people expect due to the low pass mark and the pass/fail style of certification. Most people go in expecting to have to get high marks to get certified, but the overall pass mark ranges from 44-55% depending on the level, and as low as around 32% for individual sections. You could technically get an F and still get your certificate and nobody would ever know unless you told them lol"
languagelearning,3dvt1r,galaxyrocker,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"The cutoff for passing the Irish test is 50%.

But, a lot of people still underestimate how difficult the actual tests are."
languagelearning,3dvt1r,itsudatte,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:43 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what language you're aiming for and where you're aiming from, too. In my experience most people seem to have it in their heads that to pass the highest level of the JLPT you've gotta be practically at the level a college educated native speaker, when in reality you could pass with the kanji knowledge of a kid who just graduated elementary school and the vocabulary of a kid who just entered it. I think most people expect Japanese to be super duper difficult when learning from a non-sino-influenced language though, so that probably colors their idea of how difficult the test will be."

The A0 to C2 descriptions were pretty apt, I think that the Bs are hard to define so I think you did well there.   The only part I wasn't entirely convinced on was the Heritage speakers part. I have lots of friends who fit the first point. Usually these friends had one parent who spoke a certain language but the other only spoke English so the kids never learnt. Or the parents spoke two different languages (as well as English) so the kids learnt neither. I have two friends whose mothers are Greek and who work as Greek teachers, but neither of my friends speak any Greek - much to the disappointment and regret of all concerned.   On the other hand though I have several friends who are completely fluent in English (having been born here - Australia), but also fluent in their parents language. One of my friends for example is fluent in Mandarin (speaking and listening only). She doesn't use English syntax etc, and is always mistaken for a native Mandarin speaker when in China. Similarly, my cousin married a Dutch woman who grew up in the Netherlands with Dutch obviously as her native language. Not that you would know that, she has an Australian accent and I'd known her for five years before I even knew she wasn't Australian-born, on a side note, she's also fluent in French, having studied at university in Paris and writing her PhD in French. Those who I know who are fluent in their parents' language usually attended some type of special school (Chinese school or Polish school on Saturday mornings for example) when they were young, and their parents made a conscious effort to pass on the language/culture to their children."
languagelearning,3dvt1r,itsudatte,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:53:47 2015 UTC,"The heritage-speaker topic is very broad, and much of it is beyond the scope of the article. Did you find the link to the paper that I added at the end of that section? It's the most comprehensive discussion of the topic that I could find.  Linguistics is all about exceptions. We rarely make rules that don't have exceptions. Perhaps a cleaner rule would be to say that acquiring an L1 requires immersion at a young age. Few people manage to be immersed in two languages at once. A heritage speaker results from imperfect immersion.  What's impressive about the Dutch is that they manage to simulate immersion for their children. The result is usually lots of C2 teenagers, but I can believe that a few make it to L1.  That said, are you sure your friend is L1 and not just a very strong C2? I've known people whose English was so strong that I didn't realize they were foreign speakers until I had spoken to them for a few minutes. Subtle problems with accent plus the occasional odd grammar error clue you in."
languagelearning,3dvt1r,PersikovsLizard,4,Mon Jul 20 12:21:52 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd like to point out:   B1: Knows the whole grammar, but has to think hard to use it. Can eventually say just about anything, but the process can be painful. Can read almost anything, given enough time, a good reference grammar, and unlimited use of a dictionary.   I've found that first sentence to not necessarily be true. For Irish, even at B2, you're not expected to know the whole grammar, and it mentions that right in the syllabus. There's quite a few nuances that are left out of it."

The normative definition of language levels is a bit obscure, but this clarifies things a bit.   BTW, at what level would you put a bilingual in a language but that hasn't been the L1 language? In Europe this happens somewhat often, as there are lots of minorities inside every nation that speak as L1 its own language and also learn (but not natively) the national language."
languagelearning,3dvt1r,LususV,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:17 2015 UTC,"Those are interesting cases because it's possible to imagine genuine ""double immersion"" that would make it possible for children to acquire two L1 languages.

languagelearning,3dvt1r,LususV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:28:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I talked about this because I'm an example of that. I'm bilingual Catalan/Spanish, my family and people all spoke Catalan, and Spanish was in the media and after age 6 learnt at school.   But since my ""native"" language was solely Catalan, I speak Spanish with Catalan accent, which is immediately distinguishable from any native Spanish, even if I understand/speak/write exactly like if I was a native (and not a C2). In this case, I assume I'm L1 in both languages, or is there any intermediate area between L1 and L2, where bilingual proficiency could be stated, like L1.5? That was more specifically what I was referring to."
languagelearning,3dvt1r,JS1755,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'll look around and see if I see any studies. Catalan and Spanish already have extremely similar grammar, so it's likely that they are already one of those cases where even an adult L1 speaker of either language can acquire L1 proficiency in the other.

And the Chinese internet, don't forget that one.   not trying to say you shouldn't learn a language, btw   But it sounds like that. With that attitude, I think learning a language is harder than it should be. If you don't see the sense in it, then just stop learning foreign languages. The way you describe it most people on this planet would be lucky to get rid of their native language because English is somewhat superior or so.  The situation for English native speakers is fortunate as the whole world is learning their language. That is a gift that should not bet taken for granted. Just ~100 years ago the language of science was German. French has for a long time been the lingua franca of Europe and the language of diplomacy. The European Court of Justice still uses French as their working language. On the other hand, English speaking people are in an unfortunate situation as they don't need to learn any other languages. Unfortunate only if you would like to learn some. So your motivation has to make up for that lack of necessity. The point of learning languages is to get to know other cultures. Even if you learn Korean just because you like some generic K-pop group - that also counts as other cultures. Travelling also helps with motivation.  My recommendation for you is to learn an exotic language. Try Chinese, Korean, Japanese."
languagelearning,3dzx56,jiangyou,3,Tue Jul 21 08:51:03 2015 UTC,"Jeez man, do you think this happening tomorrow or something? There will be plenty of time to learn languages and communicate with people before the ""inevitable"" takeover of the English Language.      More than that, though, just don't learn a language if you can't find a reason to. If it causes you this much internal strife it might be time for a new hobby?"
languagelearning,3dzx56,Gulliver123,5,Tue Jul 21 09:34:31 2015 UTC,"or the meaning is translated.   That doesn't make any sense. What were you expecting, no translation at all?   In 1000 years, while all the inventions are being made in English, given English names, and adopted to other languages, we'll assuredly have well over a few thousand new inventions and I'm willing to bet their names will be mutually intelligible with every language in contact with English on a regular basis   That is an awfully bold prediction. First of all, it assumes that English will be the international lingua franca for the next thousand years. That's a bloody LOT of time for the entire world geopolitical system to be overthrown and English to lose its status. It also assumes that borrowings from English will all remain frozen and will not diverge due to language change for at least a thousand years. Maybe, but not 100%. At any rate, this is a moot point for your situation, because you'll be long dead.   Well then they won't have the words for whatever they want to say (again because no or very little official control or restrictions on new words) and resort to using English word anyway which fills the gap and is one more red drop in the blue pool that is the native language.   Or, you know, they'll come up with native language coinings. There is more than one way to skin a cat.   As a native English speaker there's no other language you need and you have no barriers to entering any market or field, whereas those from countries like Japan or Sweden need to learn English for everything from Medicine to IT to philosophy to anthropology and other sciences.   I would assume most English-speakers people are learning languages to communicate with people outside of professional realms, a domain which is still dominated by non-English languages and hopefully will remain so long into the future.   At what point does it go from language evolution to coining all the terms from the global one and turning the once-separate one into almost some sort of dialect?    A point that won't come up for a looooooong time, that's for sure.    Memes? Mostly in English. Fandoms? Mostly in English. Those tear-worthy shipfics written by 12 year old girls involving Jacob and Harry Potter? English. Youtube. What do you like? Philosophical debates/religious debates? English.   I have a feeling that there's a lot of confirmation bias going on here.    It seems that most of the languages of the world will be passed on in a half-loanworded state almost solely by writing and verbal speech to me.   ?????   The fields in which a language used to hold for its people are being absorbed by the global one until it's only particularly useful for slightly meaningful smalltalk, while the rest of conversation is done in English.   There's a huge grey area between ""slightly meaningful small talk"" and scientific literature that will still be done in non-English languages for the forseeable future.    Can anyone alleviate this in my mind?   Sure. What you're doing is making decisions based on what the world maybe, maybe will be like thousands of years after you die, and even THAT is assuming the current state of the world will last the next ten centuries when the lingua franca status of English is barely a hundred years old. You're also looking at numerous types of media and assuming that because you're finding plenty of English version, that must be all that exists. Finally, you're giving scientific and technical jargon way too much credit. I don't know about you, but my life consists a lot more of the language you'll find in small talk and literature than the language you'll find in scientific papers.   So calm down."

For those of us plebians living in the present though, dips and pooping it is.  Jokes aside though, aside from aspergerly interests, heritage interests, or intellectual and health interests, learning languages at it's core is for day to day communication. There are after all plenty of people who need to learn even rare languages like nepalese... people who happen to live a life that brings them together with other nepalese speakers.   So I guess to me, talking about a hypothetical future doesn't make much sense... today is what matters. If learning another language adds something you value to your life, then learn it. If not, you won't. Global trends won't change that equation.   Also, I think you're only assuming that most of gaming and online culture is in English. There are vast tracks of space and memetic culture that only exist for the Chinese and japanese (plus others I'm sure to various degrees). Even 4chan itself started out as a bastardized offshoot from 2chan and other Japanese message boards. I imagine anyone comfortable in that subculture would say that the fact that you don't know about those cultures is a testament to what you've been exposed to, not to what's actually there. Of course, I'm not sure that diving in there would actually enrich your life, but everyone finds their own motivations I guess."

English is already developing into regional Englishes which may as well one point start to diverge enough to develop into separate languages similar to what scandinavian languages are now. As English is my second language, I already wish I had translator when I hear scots or indians speaking ""English"". Have you heard English by a Russian speaker who was taught English by someone who apparently had never been in English speaking country? In those moments you really wish people would come with subtitles over their heads. And then there's Jamaican variety and AAVE which might as well qualify as related language with different grammar rules. There is no such thing as global English. It's a multitude of diverging (not converging) Englishes and only thing common is the written language. I'm pretty sure that will change too or else we end up with the case of chinese languages which are mutually icomprehensible in speech with characters acting as written band-aid."
languagelearning,3dzx56,anagrammatron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'd really appreciate some opinions on this as well. It is a little discouraging that the most pressing needs (and thus motivations) for learning foreign languages appear to be diminishing for English speakers.   In my experience on the internet, Italian communities tend to be more independent due to language barriers while Germans set up their own mixed community within a larger English one. Since I want to participate in the former, I will learn Italian. It is harder to see the purpose of studying German except to prove to myself that I can.  I suppose, picking a language of a country which does not widely teach English would still have the pressure of necessity, but what if you're already committed to an ""unnecessary"" one? Maybe do it to show off, to communicate with the old people who didn't learn, to read classic foreign literature or watch films, to broaden your mind and way of describing the world, or to learn the meaning of futility. That's all I got.   Keep your head up; you won't be around in 1000 years so let those guys worry about international languages. There are billions of people who may never speak English, and at least one must be worth talking to!  EDIT: grammar, lol"

I suppose in the distant future most people might be bilingual, with English being a second language taught from birth (alongside the country's traditional one). Similar to what happened to Latin in Europe, as time goes on English dialects may branch off into new languages. Sadly, some languages of today will die, but that's natural."
languagelearning,3dxj6b,Toasterbag,3,Mon Jul 20 10:31:00 2015 UTC,"There's obviously an argument to be made for both, and I totally get what you're saying. I joined a language-focused Meetup and was put off by the absence of native speakers... That being said, here are some thoughts (apologies in advance for the wall of text):   Language Learning Groups can be great for motivation   If you are going the self-study route having any form of accountability can be the difference between success and failure. Even if you aren't necessarily going to the group for corrections or what have you, having a group of people who are just as enthusiastic or dedicated to learning your target language can make the process that much more satisfying/fun/etc. This clearly works better if the group is structured in such a way where you have to update on regular intervals, provides enough opportunity to actually form a connection with your group members, etc.   LLGroups can be a great way to find learning resources   I've joined a few groups and the varying resources people find and share are so incredibly helpful. It also helps that they will all essentially be peer-reviewed, so you'll have an idea of how good the resource is (taking into account that we are all diverse learners and what might not work for some, may work for someone else beautifully). You'll also have the option of checking the reliability of your own resources you are already using or that you stumble upon yourself.   People have different access to different things; i.e. don't automatically discount the knowledge of a non-native speaker   For example, I am learning Farsi, my boyfriend is Iranian--I have an excellent resource at my disposal that helps me AND anyone in my language learning community :) Additionally, if there are more than a handful of people at different levels in your chosen group (esp. for subreddits), you get the added benefit of answers being peer reviewed. Very rarely will you be getting information that is wholly incorrect.  Another thing to consider: the explanation may be easier to get. I know, just from trying to explain exactly why we say things a certain way in my own native tongue to other learners, sometimes I just can't and end up with the, ""I don't know why... we just do?""    The age old adage: any exposure is good exposure   While it is frustrating to learn incorrect material, it is part of the process of learning any language. Even in formal, classroom settings (i.e. you learn the ""proper"" or ""easier"" versions first, actual spoken/used style is learned later).  You will be, literally, unable to avoid this. Silver lining is that we tend to remember the corrections better :) so rejoice in the mistakes you learn/make. They'll sort themselves out eventually and shouldn't be a roadblock to the learning process. (That being said, it's obviously ideal to try to minimize them, or it will get incredibly frustrating.)  Second point here: my language meet up was much more helpful than I anticipated, even without the presence of native speakers. I would argue that for most language learners, esp. those of us who self study, actually speaking is one of the bigger hurdles (and generally what a healthy bunch of us consider to be our ultimate goal). Going to a regular meet up where I was forced to speak did wonders for my comfort in actually using the language. Learning everything perfectly is great, but I can't use it, what's the point?   Conclusion :)   In my experience, language learning groups are a great tool if you know how to make them work for you. They've been a great catalyst in my own progress. THAT BEING SAID, I would obviously recommend finding any sort of native input. An actual person is great, if accessible, but even listening to radio or shows will help not only develop your listening skills but allow you to get a proper feel for what is correct. All just based on my own experience.  Good luck in reaching your goals!"
languagelearning,3dxj6b,JordenMichelle,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:00 2015 UTC,I think there's really only merit to language learning groups if you're the kind of person who enjoys learning and interacting with groups. Forcing yourself to do it won't really help you.
languagelearning,3dxj6b,itsudatte,2,Mon Jul 20 10:56:12 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things, it's always better to learn with natives but if you don't have access or can't find a group willing, non-natives who may or may not make a lot of errors are better than going it alone.

The copying mistakes thing is one, but the quality of the conversations might not be that great and will mean the sessions have less of an impact.    In London, there are lots of such sessions which have a mix of natives and non-natives. I know people who have attended these sessions have found them useful."
languagelearning,3dysuh,AvatarCastiel,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"Most native speakers don't know the rules, some things just 'don't sound right' to them. Honestly I've never heard about this 'changing of pronunciation for spelling'.  That being said, as regards amico/amici you can check this  It says it depends on the position of the accent, but there are exceptions (amico/amici is one of them) and the origin of this is not clear.   mangiare conjugates to mangiamo is the extra i dropped since its in the infinitive   here you can read the rules.  Verbs ending in -iare drop the i, for example mangiare -> mangi, mangiamo (but inviare -> invii, inviamo because of the accent).  If you want to check the rules in English I found this and this."
languagelearning,3dysuh,gakushabaka,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly. amico (ah-mee-ko) to amici (ah-mee-chee) where if it were spanish it would go to amichi to preserve pronunciation.   You misunderstand what is happening. Please keep in mind that I'm really oversimplifying some of this but it should give you a general idea as to why it seems to be confusing. When Vulgar Latin transformed into what we today call Italian a certain sound shift occurred. In Latin the letter c originally represented the sound /k/ - meaning it was always pronounced like a k. So one of the things that happened was this /k/ sound started to change to /tʃ/ (the sound like ch in chips and cheese) before what are called ""front vowels"". In many of the other Romance languages the /k/ sound changed to /s/ (think Spanish cento compared to Italian cento). Keep in mind that when I say vowels I do mean the sounds and not the written letters a,e,i,o,u. Also keep in mind that different changes can take place at different times. So the Latin feminine plural that was spelled -ae was not a front vowel, it was a diphthong, so it did not suffer from that sound shift. But later that sound changed too but it didn't cause the proceeding consonant to change because it wasn't originally a front vowel.  When you say that ""if it were spanish it would go to amichi to preserve pronunciation"" you're actually wrong. If the word formed its plural in that way in Spanish, it would be amici and the c would be pronounced as /s/ or /θ/ you'd have the exact same sort of issue. So it's not that Italian is changing its pronunciation to fit the spelling, it's that the sounds of root words started to be changed by their different endings and sometimes it made sense to change the spelling to show the new pronunciation (Latin amicae => amiche in Italian because only the vowel changed) and sometimes there was no need to change the spelling because the sound shift was so complete (Latin amici continued to be spelled amici in Italian because c before i is always pronounced /tʃ/)."

Speaking wise you have the same phenomenon where the Portuguese understand Spanish better than vice versa. Generally, the Dutch will find it easier to understand german than the reverse.

Firstly, I try to remember it. In French, luckily, there are many patterns when it comes to verb conjugations and most of the time all you need to learn are a few endings to a stem. Sometimes verbs are irregular (which is usually ""the important ones""), but even these have other sets of patterns you can try out.    I follow an awesome book that starts off teaching the student about verbs and it does so in a clear and concise manner. Furthermore, I use a website to practice verbs; you can pick verbs and I start off by practising them individually and then I choose an option in which it randomly hurls verb tenses at me. This helps me a lot.    I really hope that some of this helps you, or at least someone else learning French."

If you have a friend that can help you do the spoken part of the exam, even better. This will provide you with a more objective evaluation of where your abilities actually are. Use that as your guide.  But once you get to a more intermediate level the more important some sort of structure to your learning is. And I am serious about the A2/B1 as the levels you should evaluate. This will help you fill any holes you have in grammar or vocab. Remember: these levels are not based on knowledge you have about the language but are based on an objective evaluation of what you can actually do in the language.  So if you want to claim a B2 (which is really where conversational fluency begins), then you should at least be taking a CEFR practice test to prove to yourself you are functioning at that level.

While some are better than others, they almost all lack exercises, and a few are written by people with a very...erm...unorthodox view of the language they teach. I remember Portuguese for Dummies wrote the flapped ""r"" sound as a ""d"" in every transcription guide. The Russian for Dummies author appears to think the language evolved from Sanskrit, which is the linguistics equivalent of ""The Queen is actually a giant lizard.""   However, if you're looking for a very large, very readable phrasebook, you'll find them pretty all right."

languagelearning,3dvp01,periclimenes,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"If you are a beginner, it would be good that you prep for the lesson before hand and let your tutor know what topic you want to cover. The CEFR can be a really good guide for this.    Pick a topic and inform your tutor. Research the pertinent grammar, vocab, etc. before the lesson. In the lesson, focus on the things you find hardest.  Make sure you record your lessons (with your tutor's permission) and then use that recording to review a few days later and make flash cards."
languagelearning,3dvp01,Luguaedos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  I know CEFR is the common European framework, but do you mean they have something specific about conversation topics?"
languagelearning,3dvp01,Luguaedos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"The CEFR is a functional framework. What this means is that it's concerned with what you can do in the language. Each level has a widening ring of competencies that include grammar and vocabulary around specific areas. These areas are things like family, social life, travel, health, work, hobbies, etc.  Within each of these areas you are expected to be able to perform certain tasks. For travel, you need to be able to ask directions, book a hotel, explain what you did on vacation, talk about where you'd like to travel, etc. all depending on the level. At the A levels and the B1 level these tend to go from simpler to more complex tasks, as you'd expect. For A1 you might be expected to say how many siblings you have, if your parents are still married, where you grew up, etc. But then at the A2 level you will be expected to do those things and say if you get along with your sister, how old she is, etc. And then in the B1 you might be expected to do all of that and describe how she looks, her personality, what kind of work she does, etc.  So what you do is pick an area like ""family life"" and tell your tutor you'd like to work on discussing things about family. If there is a CEFR syllabus for your target language, you can even send that. Then you start learning the base vocabulary, grammar, and common phrases you will need. An A1 student, for example, will not be expected to know things like great grandmother, so stick to the fundamentals for the level you are studying. An A1 student would also not be expected to use complex or nuanced grammar. I guess what I am saying is to manage your expectations about what you study and how you prep for the lesson. Especially at the A levels stick to knowing less in favor of knowing it really well. So stick to knowing fewer words and grammar structures but make sure what you study you have mastered."

languagelearning,3du06v,been_on,17,Sun Jul 19 13:27:29 2015 UTC,"It's always advisable to work on your listening comprehension, but I don't believe it's advisable to work on your listening comprehension by listening to full-speed native audio.   Music can be helpful even as a relative beginner -- if you're at a level where you can understand the lyrics if you see them written out, and look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary, then hearing the same song over and over is a good way to get in some repetitions of vocabulary and grammar. But things like audiobooks and TV shows? I believe in Stephen Krashen's theory that only input that's at a level we can understand actually turns into language acquisition. So at a beginner level I like to focus on podcasts for language learners, audio programs like Pimsleur or Assimil, graded readers that come with audio content, and other audio that's purposefully made slow and easy."
languagelearning,3du06v,Fillanzea,2,Sun Jul 19 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"Music can be helpful even as a relative beginner -- if you're at a level where you can understand the lyrics if you see them written out, and look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary, then hearing the same song over and over is a good way to get in some repetitions of vocabulary and grammar.   While music can help, it comes with a big caveat. First, you are just memorizing the song, not really the individual bits of grammar. But also song grammar tends to not be the same as spoken grammar in that in many songs they are much more poetic, and play with the language in ways that an early learner will find confusing. This also goes for word choice in songs sometimes as well.  The other major caveat is that singing is not just talking with a melody, and the way people single in various languages can differ from the spoken language in significant ways, with features being added or taken away, depending."
languagelearning,3du06v,Pennwisedom,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"I've also found with songs, and especially the stuff I listen to, there's also a lot of unusual/uncommon words, or certainly words that wouldn't be common to 'ordinary' language. Plus you've also got word contractions, dropped letters in words, word ordering issues (at least in Croatian anyway).   But it must be said that in my case certainly, I did find songs helpful. One of the first pieces of native Croatian I learnt was 'Bojna Čavoglave'. It's perhaps one of the more grammatically easy pieces of language I've found, it's slow enough to be understandable to even a listener with basic listening skills and Marko Perković is such a singer that whilst his style of singing is very rock-ish, you can still pick up on what's actually being said without thing sounding distorted.   However I wouldn't expect a beginner to understand something like 'Neka Ni'ko Dira U Moj Mali Dio Svemira' or 'Moj Dida I Ja' which are much more challenging."
languagelearning,3du06v,Zdrastvutye,6,Sun Jul 19 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"One of the thing that makes a foreign language foreign is that from the time you were in the womb (literally) your brain began to optimize itself for understanding the sounds of what would become your native language. The way that this occurred was via constant exposure to the the sounds of your L1 even though you did not understand the meanings the sounds conveyed. We know this is true because of fMRI studies done on new-borns. When dialogues in their parent's their native language were played the language centers of their brains lit up. When dialogues in other languages were played, their brains didn't treat the sounds as language. The same happens in adults. As a native English speaker I may consciously know that people speaking in Mandarin are speaking a language but my brain does not treat it the same. But once I get exposed to it more frequently my brain starts to pay attention. Think about how subconscious language processing is. If someone says something to you in your L1, you don't have to do anything to understand it and what's more, there is nothing you can do to prevent it being understood (assuming it's clear, normal speech).   Having your target language playing TV shows, the news, etc. will help your brain tune itself better to understand the L2. So creating a pseudo-immersive environment may have certain benefits, but doing this is not studying. And that's an important distinction. In order to learn effectively the material you use needs to be correct for your level. The idea is that learning sticks best (long-term, 3 years or more) when you are presented with situations that contain obstacles that you must surpass, but those obstacles have to be something you can surpass. Anything that is overly difficult will increase anxiety and frustration as well as lead to an increased risk of giving up due to burnout.  Listen to lots of dialogues and material for beginners. There are certainly books with MP3s for Spanish that focus specifically on listening comprehension for the A1/A2 levels. If you only know 100 words or so, stick to learning the basics well and learning them accurately. There is nothing worse than an intermediate student who can understand movies and TV in their target but still makes basic errors with irregular verbs or mispronounces simple words. If you want to watch TV in Spanish or listen to podcasts, then do that as long as you can manage to enjoy it. But don't count it as study. Study time is focused, on-task work with material for your level. Other activities are fun and critical to really learning a language but don't ever confuse the two."

The problem is that you are listening to content that you don't understand. If you only know the most common 100 words, how can you possibly expect to understand audio books and tv shows for adult native speakers who know ten of thousands of words?

languagelearning,3du3c6,TaazaPlaza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"Grammar and syntax are big issues for me.   With pronunciation, I think I really have issues with aspirated consonants and retroflex ones. I can pronounce most of the fine in isolation, but as part of a word I struggle. I also seem to mess up nasalisation - I do it at the wrong times, and forget to do it when I should.   Btw, what's that ""Sau"" as your native language?"
languagelearning,3du3c6,govigov03,5,Sun Jul 19 15:13:24 2015 UTC,"Reposting my previous response from here: /r/languagelearning/comments/2b8fzm/struggling_with_hindi_sounds_help/  Well, as you may already know the consonants of the devanagari alphabet is divided into individual clusters in which the sounds arise from the same region. http://i.imgur.com/6aMQ6qO.gif  Here's a soundcloud recording of me pronouncing all the consonants: https://soundcloud.com/govib/devanagiri-consonants  Dental: Sounds arising while your front part of the tongue touches behind the upper teeth:  त (ta: as in Margaret ""Tha""tcher)  थ (tha: this is the aspirated version of त, just put in more force of air)  द (da: as in ""the""m)  ध (dha: aspirated version of द)   न (na: this is an easy one to pronounce eg. ""na""me)  Labial: Sounds arising while both lower and upper parts of lips touch each other.   प (pa: as in ""pe""n)  फ (pha: aspirated version of प just put in more force of air)  ब (ba: as in ""ba""ll)  भ (bha: aspirated version of ब just put in more force of air)  म (ma: as in ""mo""ther)  Sometimes usually learners get confused between the retroflex and dental consonants.  Retroflex: Sounds arising while your tongue touches the upper part of the mouth. The easiest eg. could be ""ti""ck-""to""ck of ट (unaspirated), ठ(aspirated), and eg. could be ""da""mn, ""de""corate for ड (unaspirated) ढ (aspirated).  As for the last retroflex consonant ण (na), it is unique and there is no equivalent sound in English. Just imagine pronounce the dental न (na) but roll your tongue further back and say ""na"" while touching the top part of your mouth.  Hope that helps."

languagelearning,3du3c6,TaazaPlaza,2,Mon Jul 20 09:00:33 2015 UTC,"Saurashtra. It's an (southern) Indo Aryan language. Has more aspirated consonants than Hindi (lh, mh, nh, rh) and more retroflex (retroflex l). No nasalization though.  Aspirated consonants only get really emphasized in the beginning of syllables, in my experience. Elsewhere they are very weak. If you're an English speaker you already do this with initial p/t/k etc already, maybe without you knowing. Maybe realizing that and consciously splitting the English k into k and kh can help in distinguishing the two in your speech. Also just like in English it's only strong at the beginning of syllables.  Retroflex is hard for me to explain because pretty much anything spoken in India has retroflex consonants. Dravidian languages, Indo Aryan languages (except Assamese) and hell even Indian English. I think listening to slower (modern) songs where they enunciate clearly might help you with this. Or even listening to Indian English, imitating a stereotypical accent and saying stuff like 'truth', 'trash', etc!  Hope at least some of that made sense and/or was helpful."
languagelearning,3du3c6,anything_bro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:12 2015 UTC,Saurashtra looks cool. Similar to Gujarati and Marathi?   I think I've got retroflex down for now. Everything just gets harder with aspiration :-)
languagelearning,3du3c6,anything_bro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:01:58 2015 UTC,"Apparently the vocab is close to Marathi and the verbal system to Gujarati. I could recognize loads of cognates in Marathi on a short recent trip to Pune but didn't have enough time for more. Not been exposed to Gujarati to compare with it though.  Also, I think the written form kinda exaggerates aspiration in a way. In the sense, it's etymologically significant, but sometimes you find aspirated consonants in weird parts of the syllable or in tough clusters and in speech the ones that aren't at the syllable's beginning are weakly pronounced and de-emphasized. I don't want to make an absolutist statement here but I think as long as you get the syllable initial aspirated consonants right, you'll be fine."

I have all the resources in the world for it; my SO and best friend are both native Hindi speakers, 60% of my coworkers are from India as well, yet I can't get a hold of it.   For me the most difficult part has been learning which words are ""too Hindi"" and thus not used in modern Hindi. They get replaced with strange, altered versions of the word in English, but you still have to use them properly in a sentence.   Every book, workbook, and website so far (got hope for the Duolingo tree though) has been full of outdated vocabulary. Even though it's real Hindi, people really speak ""Hinglish."""

The Hindi that I DO know comes from ~1 year of occasionally talking to my best friend in Hindi messing around, he corrects me, I learn a little bit.   It's not easy, or productive for that matter lol but it keeps me from getting frustrated with the language materials I have or with Hindi itself."
languagelearning,3du3c6,tool_of_justice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"For me the most difficult part has been learning which words are ""too Hindi"" and thus not used in modern Hindi. They get replaced with strange, altered versions of the word in English, but you still have to use them properly in a sentence.   If it helps, lots of languages have this problem. It's because Hindi is something called a ""diglossia"" where there are really two distinct types of a language: Formal and Informal, that are so separate they might as well be different languages (like ""pure Hindi"" and ""Hinglish"").  Tons of Indian languages have this problem, so it isn't endemic to Hindi."

You can directly translate the word order to the same as English, which produces a sentence to sound very very poetic.   For example, My name is Jake.     English Hindi    My मेरा (Mera)   Name नाम (Naam)   Is है (Hai)   Jake जेक (Jake)    So if you say ""मेरा नाम है जेक।"" instead of ""मेरा नाम जेक है।"" (Mera naam Jake hai), which is the general convention, you start sounding poetic, but you retain the meaning.   A lot of native speaker do this sometimes.     Basically, if you say it like this, you sound like Yoda."

I'll teach you some which I used daily.   साला (saa-laa) - Literally translates to ""Your wife's husband"", but it is used to mean ""I fucked you sister"". It is a very light insult and often used as a term of endearment. Wouldn't use in front of parents. भैनचोद (bhen-chod) - Means ""sisterfucker"". Also very light, but I wouldn't use it in front of parents. It is often the replacement for the word ""fuck"" as an interjection in English.  कुत्ता (Kut-ta) - Means ""dog"". Equivalent of using the word ""bitch"" in English. Very light.  हरामी (huh-raam-ee) - Means ""bastard"". It's a pretty heavy insult. I was in a fight once because I said this to a person accidentally while misspeaking the Pokemon's name (Hariyama). मादरचोद (maa-dar-chod) - Means ""motherfucker"". It is a very heavy insult. Can really provoke people.  तेरी माँ का साकी नाका (te-ree maa kaa saa-kee naa-kaa) - I don't actually know what this means, but if you say this to me, I will kill your family. It is one of the worst swears I know. छक्का (chhak-ka) - Means ""transgendered"". This is basically a slur, but can be said to anyone. Even though I never use this insult, it will, however, really really make someone furious if you say it to them. Even progressive and liberal Indians.  गस्ती (gus-tee) - Means ""prostitute/whore/slut"". It can be used in the same way as the English word. If you say it to a guy, he'll laugh it off. If you say it to a girl, you'll be beaten up. पागल (paa-gull) - Means ""idiot/stupid/retarded"". This is very light and can even be used by small children. खोता (Kho-taa) - Means ""donkey"". You use it when you want to call someone stupid. It is very light. फाड़ दूंगा (phaad doong-aa) - Means ""I will tear [your ass up by fucking it]"" Pretty heavy. फट गई? (phat gayii?) - You're asking someone if their ass is torn up because of hardcore anal. This is used when someone is stressed, scared or intimidated or you want to make them stressed, scared or intimidated. It is quite heavy.  गांडू (gaan-doo) - Means ""someone who gets assfucked often"". I'll let you guess the intensity of this one.  कमीना (kuh-mee-naa) - Means ""slavish/sly"". Used as a term of endearment.      If you want more, just tell me! I'll be happy to tell you more.  Note: These are all assuming that you're man swearing to another man. If you want, I can tell you the other forms such as male-female and female-male and female-female.  Edit: Minor edit with one swear."

I've heard it all the time in movies but I can't figure out how to use it.  Like in 3 idiots, Rancho tells someone ""go get an education"" and they reply ""who will pay for it? Tera baap?"""
languagelearning,3du3c6,Pinuzzo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, my bad. That was a mistake. Thank you for pointing it out!  When you hear ""तेरा बाप"" (te-raa baap), which translates to ""your father"", it is usually accompanied by someone asking about payments (because your father works and pays your bills). It is not a swear. It is used as a way of sarcastically telling something that something is very expensive.   For example,   Person 1: मुझे अपने जन्मदिन पर एक नया कम्प्यूटर चाहिए। (I want a new computer for my birthday)  Person 2: पैसे कौन देगा? तेरा बाप? (Who will pay? Your father?)     There's a similar thing with ""तेरी माँ?"" (te-ree maa) which means ""your mother"". This is used when something is a very tedious task.   For example,   Person 1: मै सोने जा रहा हूँ।  (I'm going to sleep)  Person 2: बर्तन कौन धोएँगा? तेरी माँ? (Who will do the dishes? Your mother?)"

The guy's scores were all 3s, while the girl's were all 4s.               75 points max, their scores were 45 and 60. 45 equals to 200 on Cambridge english scale, while 60 equals to 213.  I believe the trick is, that the scale has a kind of exponential pattern. I suppose the 'skill gap' between 200 and 213 is bigger than the gap between 180 and 193.  230 is the max score by the way."

languagelearning,3duxqa,MarburgDE,4,Sun Jul 19 18:47:41 2015 UTC,Imo you should be trying to hear the language as much as possible and not focus so much on being corrected all the time. Have a specific part of your learning dedicated to hearing and producing sounds that are not part of English - but learn to speak without over-thinking what you are saying. Really second language learners learn faster if they speak organically and not by constantly translating from their first language or over-thinking how they pronounce and how things like conjugation work. Things like accent will come easiest when you are already comfortable speaking.
languagelearning,3duxqa,polyrythmie,4,Sun Jul 19 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's a lot more motivating to do the learning part together.  My boyfriend also learns Estonian mainly because of me. He wouldn't actually need it as all my friends and relatives know English and/or German, but he still wants to learn it, which is great.  We got him a textbook and whenever I have time, I explain things to him. Other than that, he's also studying with the book himself, but whenever he has a question, he asks me.   In addition, I created a memrise course for him that only we two have access to. We both add words to that course and whenever he adds some words, I control them to avoid any possible mistakes. In the first few months he was really active on memrise, learning new words every day. That definitely was a good way to start.  Now the most important part is to start using the language. We sort of did it right away. Whenever I was sure that he has learned a word or some particular part of grammar, I tried to use it. Or the other way around, whenever I talk to him, I try to say it in Estonian using words he should know. It's not like Estonian makes up 100% of our conversations, but it's constantly progressing.   Also, when we go for a walk or so, I sometimes just try to think of a word that could be useful and which he hasn't learned yet and then just explain it. In Estonian. And then the next day I would ask him about that very same word. Sometimes he'd forget it several times in a row, and then it would start annoying him, so that eventually he'd remember the word.  As soon as he was able to speak a little bit, he often refused to use any other language than Estonian with my friends or my family. It got awkward sometimes as he did not always understand, but he really made a lot of progress thanks to that.  Another thing we do is watching movies or reading comics together. Comics because actual novels would be too hard at this point.   And well, learning the language of your partner also is a big advantage as your partner probably knows how to keep you motivated, e.g. with rewards. For example, after he learned the past forms of verbs, I'd ask him to ""say 10 sentences about what you did yesterday without making a single mistake"" and I'll cook dinner today. If you make a mistake, you'll have to cook. May sound stupid, but after three days, he didn't make any mistakes anymore."

Both seem to have around the same number of lessons (I made a really rough estimate of around a hundred each) though I can't say if the level achieved is the same - I'm assuming it to be.  However, ChineseSkill doesn't have either speaking or writing tests, so this is a big plus to HelloChinese. CS does have a sort of jigsaw test where you assemble the character, though it isn't the same as reviewing an entire character from scratch. The thing I do like about CS is that it has the option choose between Traditional and Simplified characters for testing whereas HC only allows Simplified. Now I'm partial to Traditional characters since I have some experience with Japanese kanji and the Traditional characters make more sense are more easily decodable. I'm sure this feature could be added to HC easily enough - it must be easier than coding a speech or writing recognition software - and if it does, I would immediately switch over to HC. But so long as that feature isn't there I wouldn't want to stop using CS.  TL;DR: Both courses have similar length and coverage. HC has better tools like speech and writing recognition, while CS has Traditional character support (which is a clinching point for me)"

The downside is that it can only be written with fountain pens or pencils because the thickness of the stroke determines the difference between some sounds."

Secondly, IMO the most visually striking abugidas are the one used for Burmese and Khmer.  Finally, since you can read Arabic I suggest moving on to the Hebrew abjad, which does have many similarities (compare sin ש in Hebrew with sin س in Arabic)."
languagelearning,3ds44x,cactus9,2,Sun Jul 19 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"Devanagari is obviously going to be the most ""practical,"" further, so many other abugidas are based around it so once you've got it down, you're already on your way to picking up a whole slew of other Brahmic-originated scripts. However, maybe go for one of the really cool-looking rounded ones. Burmese is rad as all get-out, but I've always been personally fascinated by Sinhala.

languagelearning,3dontu,cwf82,3,Sat Jul 18 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the word was older than that. It just wasn't used in English until 1917. If my French is good enough (odds are it's not), http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/camoufler suggests it's from the early 1800s in French.   Étymol. et Hist. 1821 pronom. « se déguiser » (cité par Esn.); 1836 trans. « déguiser » (Vidocq, Les Voleurs, p. 53); 1878 « falsifier (une boisson, p. ex.) » (Rigaud, Jargon parisien ds Esn.); 1914-18 milit. (d'apr. Esn. Poilu, p. 129); 1916 (Barbusse, Le Feu, p. 103). Prob. formé (avec dés. -er) sur le rad. de camouflet*, la notion de « dissimulation » étant issue de celle de « fumée » (FEW t. 16, p. 475a; Bl.-W.5), plutôt qu'empr. à l'ital. camuffare (EWFS2; Dauzat 1972) attesté au sens de « travestir, rendre méconnaissable » (fin xiiies.-début xives.) de « tromper » (xves. ds Batt.), cette hyp. rendant de toute manière nécessaire la réf. à camouflet pour expliquer -fl-. Fréq. abs. littér. : 78.   Also of note, camofleur as a derived term:   DÉR. Camoufleur, euse, subst. masc. et fém.Celui (celle) qui exécute un camouflage. − [kamuflœ:ʀ]. − 1resattest. 1901 (Bruant, p. 253 : Habilleuse de coulisses. Camoufleuse); 1907 (France : Camoufleur. Agent déguisé); de camoufler, suff. -eur2*. − Fréq. abs. littér. : 1.   Digging back deeper, from http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camouflage&allowed_in_frame=0   1917, noun, verb, and adjective, from French camoufler, Parisian slang, ""to disguise,"" from Italian camuffare ""to disguise,"" which is of uncertain origin, perhaps a contraction of capo muffare ""to muffle the head."" Probably altered by influence of French camouflet ""puff of smoke,"" on the notion of ""blow smoke in someone's face."" The British navy in World War I called it dazzle-painting.    Checking the etymology of camuffare:   camuffare v. tr. [prob. der. del lat. mediev. muffula «manopola», con prefisso pegg.]. [probably derived from the medieval Latin muffula1]   The Latin actually is arguably from Proto-Germanic:   Medieval Latin muffula (“a muff”), of Germanic origin (—first recorded in the Capitulary of Aachen in 817 CE), from Frankish *muffël ""a muff, wrap, envelope"" from *muff- ""sleeve, wrap"" (from Proto-Germanic *mawwō (“sleeve”)) + *vël ""skin, hide"" (from Proto-Germanic *fellą (“skin, film, fleece”), from Proto-Indo-European *pel(e)(w)-, *plē(w)- (“skin, hide”)). Akin to Middle High German mouwe, mōwe (“sleeve”) (German Muff ""muff"", Dutch mouw ""sleeve""). Alternate etymology traces the Medieval Latin word to Frankish *molfell (“soft garment made of hide”) from *mol (“softened, forworn”) (akin to Old High German molawēn ""to soften"", Middle High German molwic ""soft"") + *fell (“hide, skin”). Akin to Old High German fel (“fell, skin, hide”), Old English fell (“fell, skin, hide”). More at mulch, fell, camouflage.   So in fairness, two things:   there was a word in English before camouflage: dazzle-painting the technique itself didn't really exist until relatively recently (painting something to appear as if it were part of the natural background)   1 Latin muffula is a mitten. English cognate: muffler (thing that covers your hands) and muff (haha), being the pubic hair that covers the genitals."

languagelearning,3dontu,prium,17,Sun Jul 19 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Origin: ""Popular Science Monthly"", August 1917   SINCE the war started the Popular Science Monthly has published photographs of big British and French field pieces covered with shrubbery, railway trains ""painted out"" of the landscape, and all kinds of devices to hide the guns, trains, and the roads from the eyes of enemy aircraft.  Until recently there was no one word in any language to explain this war trick. Sometimes a whole paragraph was required to explain this military practice. Hereafter one word, a French word, will save all this needless writing and reading. Camouflage is the new word, and it means ""fooling the enemy."" Example: —A dead horse lay between the British and German lines on a bit of rising ground. During the night the dead horse was removed and an imitation, with a man inside, was substituted. The men who constructed and painted the fake horse practiced camouflage. They are known as camoufleurs."
languagelearning,3dontu,tortillascomputingco,11,Sat Jul 18 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"For a bit of etymology, camoufler comes from camouflet which is a way more ancient word (with almost the same pronounciation). Originally a camouflet was a kind of dense smoke you sprayed in the face of someone for laughs, and later became synonymous to ""humiliation"".  They kept the ""dense smoke"" meaning and expanded it to make the word camoufler, I guess."
languagelearning,3dontu,KyleG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:22:32 2015 UTC,"My link above hypothesizes the etymology is another word, but was influenced by camouflet.

That's the best analogy I can come up with, like some languages are more commonly related to others.

I want to learn Choctaw or Manx, I'm sure plenty of people do but there's FUCK ALL resources beyond a few phrasebooks and stuff. The former two languages may be comparatively difficult to speakers of other, unrelated languages, but they're certainly not lacking in resources. In fact they're absolutely saturated! Manx and Choctaw however are badly in need of new materials and modern technology, as are aboriginal Australian, Polynesian, Amerindian and other Native American and Celtic languages.  The fact of the matter is that if you're not doing well in your Japanese or Chinese learning, you can't blame the materials - there's a massive corpus of them you can draw from.

It's the linguistic equivalent of being an anti-vaxxer!  Mocking someone's language, accent, dialect, whatever, is as bad as mocking their skin colour, or their ethnicity. It's just as much a part of them, albeit an intangible one. When you place them below others, you're adding to the marginalisation and thus consciously destroying our collective human heritage.  If people understood this (or were open to understanding more), nobody has to be relegated to the history books. Nobody has to lose out. This isn't some Civ III cultural victory crap."

It is true that learning another 1000 will only increase that to 99.8%, but if you look at it another way you are decreasing the amount you don't know from 4% to 0.2%, which is a reduction by a factor of 20, so it is still very much worth it.

There is only one verb with an irregular past tense, and it's so common you'll never forget it (идти, to go).  Hate: Declensions might not be very hard but on the other hand are the 17 types of conjugation in Russian, with various subtypes depending on whatever vowel appears or disappears or how the last consonant of the stem mutates, and for each subtype an extra three patterns on where the stress falls (stem, ending, or ending for 1st person singular and stem for other persons), not to mention the 6 participles with (afaik) unpredictable stress patterns.  I've been studying Russian for about 3 years now, with various degrees of intensity, and while I haven't struggled with declensions or genders in a very long time, I'm still very uncertain about the conjugation of verbs in a lot of contexts. It's a big problem for my fluency :/ I generally avoid the participles and replace them with a relative clause. They sound bookish anyways ;)"

I can tell you from my experience with Chinese that unless you are passionate about it, Japanese is going to be a pain in the ass if you really want to become fluent (in both spoken and written form). But what was your question exactly?"
languagelearning,3dnzfy,jiangyou,8,Fri Jul 17 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people don't like putting a time to how long it takes to acquire a language. So, in spite of that, I'm going to do just that.  Obviously, there are a lot of factors that affect your learning. For example, there's the distributed practice theory (where learning is optimized when it is spread over time, a.k.a. SRS). There's the total time hypothesis (where amount learned is correlated with time spent learning). There's also your level of arousal (where your level of interest in the material you use impacts your learning, a.k.a. it's hard to learn and remember shit that puts you to sleep which is where a lot of textbooks go wrong). Also, as I have learned, life can get in the way. It's been difficult for me to learn a language while ensuring I maintain high marks at University. At least my programming skills have improved which I guess is still a language.  I think it's pretty safe to say that if you put in an hour or two a day (more days than not) learning vocabulary and practicing grammar, and an hour or so a day (more days than not) speaking the language, in three or so years you can expect to be pretty damn good with the language.  So you're 22. You've learned English and Spanish. You want to learn two more languages. Given my rough working here, I'd say you can expect to learn four languages by the time you're 28. If you decide to learn Japanese, you're really gonna have to work your ass off. Learning Chinese characters is no joke. Reading and writing in logograms and syllabograms when you've spent all your life reading and writing in letters is a shock to the system. I almost wanna learn Korean instead but they have so many fucking consonants and vowels..."

I also want to learn Japanese, but I'm saving that for last. That's not something I feel like you can really sneak in on the side...Japanese will require all of my attention to get good at, so I need to really polish the other three first.  Go for it."

That being said, I aim to regularly learn a language for the rest of my life even if I don't ever become fluent in a second language. I don't mind being a linguistic dilettante as long as I have a useful enough knowledge of the language.

He asked me: How many minutes do you spend each day speaking PERFECT Spanish?  I thought for a minute and said: Very little, when you consider how many mistakes I make. (I speak Spanish very well but will make small mistakes here and there).  This is exactly what he wanted me to say since it is the truth for just about every language learner.  His recommendations: Read for an absolute minimum of 15 minutes each day in your target language. Then, spend 5 minutes copying a paragraph or article that you find interesting. In this way, you are guaranteed each day to spend at LEAST 20 minutes using your target language PERFECTLY.   In addition he recommended the obvious things such as watching television, listening to podcasts and music, etc.   Personally I believe that if you get enough input, you will start to get a feeling for what is right and wrong. It' already happened to me with certain things, and it's a very exciting feeling when you realize what is happening."

It maybe an unappealing answer, but I'd say just do more. I think six more months at an hour or two a day should see you in a pretty good place.  To make it more appealing, make sure you are doing stuff you like. I think series are good for motivation because you can see yourself improve more clearly. It's also helpful because authors and characters have  a ""voice"" that you become accustomed to which supports your learning. So, with French, I guess it's Tintin, Asterix, tv series, Harry Potter, whatever.  To make it more efficient, make sure you are reading at i+1. If it's way above your level, you will not learn efficiently. So, read lots of easy stuff for a while.   And I think you can improve your listening by combining audiobooks with paper or ebooks. E.g read Harry Potter in French, then listen to same in car  or listen and read at same time.   Or find simple news stories with transcripts. I hear they exist for French.   Hope something there was helpful."

It's almost like the weed-out place. People who can get through that extremely annoying period stand at a chance at becoming fluent. A lot of people just quit before then, though because translating everything from one language into another really is mentally tiring.  Look for shows you like in French that are subtitled in English. You'll be learning sentence structure in a more natural way and you'll probably enjoy it as well."
languagelearning,3doa8x,DominionGalactica,3,Sat Jul 18 11:37:50 2015 UTC,"I have hit the same plateau conversatinally, and I think it is because having a conversation is a completely different skill set than learning words and syntax and structure.

They can read with you and converse, which will help."
languagelearning,3doeqp,SuperWhaii,5,Fri Jul 17 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"I'm currently really getting into learning Russian, and the hardest part for me was actual production. I spent a few days with a friend of mine whose family is Russian, and I could understand them about 50% (a number I am very proud of as a beginner), but when it came to me actually responding in Russian, I choked more often than not. At best I could say ""hello"", "" thank you"", and ""goodbye"". Anything more than that I both felt really self-conscious about and I just didn't know enough vocabulary offhand to say something meaningful.  I've since started reading some children's books and taking every new word (counting different forms of the same word as different words), as well as whole sentences, and putting them all into Quizlet to study and drill later.  My strategy so far is vocabulary saturation so next time I get to talk to a native/fluent speaker I can at least stutter out a response, rather than just stare dumbly and make that fish motion with my mouth."
languagelearning,3doeqp,NLBuescher,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for responding!  Sometimes, we're our toughest critics- not necessarily a bad thing, but 50% doesn't sound bad at all for a beginner to me! I sat through a whole beginner's level Arabic course, got an ""A"" in the class, and then could probably understand 3% of what was being said to me. Now that is a darn shame :(  But getting over that fear of speaking can be really tough! Even though I've been fluent in my 2nd language for years, I still get self-conscious sometimes. But it's awesome that you're making a conscious effort to solve the problems you're having. I guess that's the bright side about being your own toughest critic ;)  Best of luck to you!"

Another problem is becoming familiar with the colloquial form of a language. In the language I'm learning many things are different from what I learn at school, so that's a problem.

I don't really have that problem with German or Spanish anymore and I didn't really do anything specific to work on it. I just practiced, lived in the respective countries for a while, and got used to interacting with people.  I guess I have more sympathy than advice. The one thing I'd say, which is more motivational than practically helpful, is to pay attention to how often you actually don't understand those snippets of conversations or first words in your native language.

Visitez aussi /r/France et peut être /r/quebec, les deux vont vous aider à apprendre la la vie français simplement en vous exposant à la langue et les manières de le parler."

Aber naja, ich bin besonders gespannt auf meine Reise nach Südtirol. Es interessiert micht einfach, und außerdem: schönes Wetter (hoffentilich), schöne Berge, schöne Trachten, und saugeiler Dialekt...wie kann man das nicht lieben? Es ist schon jahrelang mein Traum dort hinzufahren. Ich mein, es ist nicht so, als würde mir hier in Bayern was davon fehlen, aber es ist trotzdem ein wenig anders.

Meistens weil viele Schulen nur Deutsch anbieten.  Ich glaube ich habe den Faden von dem du sprichst gefunden. Und das war ich nicht.  Ich hoffe du wirst eine gute Reise nach Südtirol haben.

Bin zwar mehr auf Westmittelbairisch konzentriert, weil das da wo ich wohne geredet wird, aber die anderen bairischen Dialekte zu verstehen ist es auch nicht schwer. Hoffentlich lerne ich bis Ende September genug, um nicht wie ein Preiß zu klingen.  Und ja, ich weiß eigentlich, dass man in Dänemark in der Schule Deutsch lernt.

Somewhat exotic, but with rather familiar concepts.  I like it that many of its features are quite like in German, like the way ""to seem"" works: Aus + sehen = välja + nägema."
languagelearning,3dj602,Jeytas,6,Thu Jul 16 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Somewhat exotic, but with rather familiar concepts.   That's why I didn't want to choose Finnish, because that is proper Uralic, and Estonian is like, mixed a bit."
languagelearning,3dj602,saxy_for_life,3,Thu Jul 16 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"On some level though, Finnish is easier. One difficulty in learning Estonian is that you have to memorize several forms of each verb or noun you see, but in Finnish it's almost always more predictable. At least for the nouns, part of this is because at some point in its history, Estonian deleted vowels from the ends of a lot of words. Now you have to know which vowel was there.  Example:  Estonian- nom. lind, gen. linnu, part. lindu  Finnish- nom. lintu, gen. linnun, part. lintua"
languagelearning,3dj602,Lumilintu,3,Thu Jul 16 20:40:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, välja nägema is more specific than aussehen. They both mean 'to look' but while the German aussehen also means 'to seem', the Estonian välja nägema doesn't.  Instead, for 'to seem' you'd say either tunduma or paistma in Estonian. And tunduma again is the equivalent of Finnish tuntua.  Also, if you go for the noun instead, I mean German Aussehen 'look, appearance', you'd get Estonian välimus which is basically just väli- with a derivational suffix. Now when you compare it to Finnish, you see that in this case Finnish is more close to the German word, having ulko+näkö - Aus-sehen.  You're right, Estonian has many features from German, BUT Finnish also got influenced by Germanic languages. In addition, German was not the only Germanic language that influenced Estonian.  For a German native speaker Estonian might be the easier option to learn as it has tons of German loanwords. On the other side, /u/saxy_for_life is definitely right as well, Finnish is a lot more regular. While in Finnish in most cases it's enough to just know several noun/verb types and their conjugations/declinations, in Estonian it's a lot more complicated. You usually have to learn at least three forms of every word to know how to conjugate or declinate it."
languagelearning,3dj602,Lumilintu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Now that you are saying, I think I misspelled it. The more appropriate equivalent for Aussehen (in the sense of ""look like"", ""seem"") would be väljas nägema. Keeleklikk's got a video where the lady uses this sentence: ""Kuidas ta näeb väljas?""  Interesting, the word building of *ulkonäkö"". I believed Finnish was much more conservative in its approach, and had solely taken some loanwords and calques from Swedish, whereas Estonian got strongly influenced by Low German (therefore its similarity to Standard German).  I could pretty much notice that. I've concluded Estonian becomes easier once you've got a knowledge of Finnish. Finnish word forms are much more predictable, and because of cognates, Estonian ones also become easier to guess."
languagelearning,3dj602,afderrick,2,Sun Jul 19 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"No no no no no. Even if keeleklikk has that in a video, it's definitely wrong. The verb is välja nägema.  välja means 'out', like German (her)aus. väljas means 'outside'. Kuidas ta näeb väljas? wouldn't make any sense at all, unless his/her eyesight differs when he/she is standing outside... It just sounds wrong.  Finnish has quite some Swedish loans. I can't really tell you a number, Estonian has probably more loans than Finnish, but that doesn't mean that Finnish is ""pure"", without any loans. Especially in spoken language Swedish loans are really common.   Estonian got influenced by Low German a lot during the Hanseatic time, but in addition it has some proto-Germanic loans that you can also find in Finnish (e.g. kuningas), Swedish loans and Standard German loans."

In that regard finnougric languages are a lot more thankful as their orthographies are usually quite phonetic.

languagelearning,3dj602,Lumilintu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Oh no no, Swedish spoken like a Finn and Swedish spoken by a Swedish speaking Finn is very different. Suomenruotsi is a proper dialect of Swedish meanwhile what you were called as was probably just a finnish sounding accent. Just to clear that up.  Dutch has these language reforms that they still do and they modify the writing to better suit the use of the language. Obviously not everyone is very pleased that the spelling changes every ten years or so but those are still quite minor changes I think. Anyways the ortography is very clear and neat. I also think that if you asked any native to speak their native language so you can practise that language they are always nice about it, well, at least usually. I hear a lot of ""Dutch people switch immediately to English"" which I would think is not a problem if you wanna speak Dutch. I mean that happens in the whole of Northern Europe too but just by asking it's ok."

Instead, there are two other reasons why I'd probably end up with something similar to Suomenruotsi. 1) I don't have any Swedish friends, but in fact a couple of Finland Swedish friends and 2) I'm sort of having this naive dream of learning the Swedish that was spoken in Estonia in ""the good old times"", then grap my Talharpa and play old Estonian Swedish songs. Now that Estonian Swedish is sort of extinct, Finland Swedish would be the closest I could get to that. Those two are quite close, as much as I've heard. Though I still hope that I can find material for Estonian Swedish. Somehow, some day.

Hopefully some will find it helpful when considering picking a course on Memrise. I'm currently on my 19 day streak on Beginner's German (A1) by memrise (that's an actual username). So far, so good but if there is one con I'd point out then it is that it doesn't explain grammar and without my previous fling with German and having a Collins easy learning  German Grammar at hand I wouldn't have been able to get where I am right now."
languagelearning,3dib36,HomeBrainBox,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"Courses like that can be very helpful but I honestly think they are the least effective use for Memrise. I really prefer courses that give you complete sentences or at least phrases that illustrate either a grammar point or a nuance of usage. For example, a course that is for CEFR A2 English might have a level for the simple past (300 examples), a level for the present perfect (300 examples) and then a level illustrating the differences between the two tenses I went there yesterday vs. I've gone there recently with close to 600 examples. This way I can use pretty much any CEFR book for A2 and when I get to the chapter on the simple past I can go in and read through all the examples of the simple past and get an idea for how it looks and how it is used. Next I can do the lesson in the course book and then start doing the corresponding level in the Memrise course. I'd repeat it with the present perfect and then start doing the section that contrasts the usage of the two tenses. Doing this I get exposure to hundreds of examples of usage of the grammar point as well as exposure to lots of new vocabulary. Obviously this only works with tapping tests. Spelling out the sentences would be far too much work.   For me, Memrise really is best for support for learning in conjunction with some sort of course or for review of topics you already know.

My Spanish tandem partner who is learning German (currently on B1 level) gets send every couple of months to Germany, together with some native German speakers, to meet with clients. Although he cannot actively participate in the conversations, he'd certainly not be there, if it wasn't about his German. Hypothetically, you never know when there will be this very important business partner who only speaks German and you are the only one being able to close the deal. More realistic, start off your conversation in German, sympathise with your counterpart, set the foundation for a successful deal and then talk business in English. Furthermore, many universities and businesses require you to speak German if you want to work for them (in case you might have ever considered moving to Germany).  On the other hand, personally I would not talk in German with any business partner if he did not speak on a very high level and I believe this to be true for many other Germans as well.  Concluding, diving deeper into German will certainly allow you to step up your game and help you in specific situations. However, I do not believe that you will encounter many business situations in which you will be relying completely on your abilities to speak German."

I guess that it's just as of now, I have plenty of things I could do with French than Italian. It's probably because I didn't invest myself in it.

languagelearning,3dk5dt,adventuringraw,3,Sun Jul 19 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"I taught myself a good amount of Japanese while I was in highschool... enough to read a number of books, play through a number of RPGs, and get to where I was watching anime with japanese subtitles and following along relatively comfortably. I dropped it years ago at this point... I learned (like a lot of other people on this subreddit it sounds like) the basics of at least a handful of other languages... read a few books in spanish, spent a few months barely scratching the surface of mandarin, and got up to speed with using shorthand as a way of journaling. Over the last year I've been learning German, and I'm getting pretty comfortable with reading and listening at this point, even if my speaking and writing is pretty shitty.   All this is to say... there's a lot of choices you can make, and you'll gain some things by some, and lose some things with others. The shorthand especially was amazing, since it stripped away everything but the bare minimum of a new language, and gave me a chance to explore what actually using a language looks like. From the sounds of it, you'd gain similar from Esperanto. Gave me a huge appreciation for actual use of a language vs flash cards and grammar, and passive reading/listening, which is where I tended to focus with language learning in the past. Learning some basic spanish was fun, and let me talk to some friends at least a little bit in their language. Every time I picked something new up, I learned more about how I learn, and got the chance to re-evaluate from the beginning what I was doing. Ultimately that means that if/when I pick japanese back up again, I'll be in a radically different place with it, and won't run into any of the same old plateaus, road blocks, and time sinks I used to have.   On the other hand though, spanish is part of your heritage, it's part of your family, and it sounds like it's even a pretty direct part of your day to day life. So the choice... do you want to wander off on an intellectual pursuit and learn more about how your mind works, and how languages in general are different, and how they're the same? Or do you want to solidify spanish into being a comfortable part of your life, part of your identity, and part of how you relate to some of the most important people in your life? Only you can make that choice, but if it was me... at the very least I'd make a point of spending some time every day speaking with family just to keep the language fresh. It takes a disgusting amount of time using a language before it gets fully automatic across the whole breadth of scope of how you think and what you want to express, but at least continuing to use it somewhat will keep you from losing what you still have. Since you only have so many hours in a day... maybe switch some of your other hobbies over to spanish and cut back on english for a while. Learn something new as a hobby, but hang out with spanish speakers, play games on spanish servers, or find some other ways to enjoy your time while using spanish instead of english."

In saying that though, obviously Mandarin, Arabic, and Russian would be the most 'beneficial' economic language to learn. However, Germany needs IT professionals so with your background I'd reccomend German. It's a Germanic language and I'm assuming your monolingual (a bilingual person would understand the dedication it takes to learn a language), therefore it would be easier for you to learn over the other three aforementioned. Two languages are better than one and I can tell you from experience that extrinsic motivation eg for a career only lasts so long.

Although I might have been misguided?

For German jobs from my understanding they are very proficient at English (especially high level employment) and I would only need a B1 level to function and pick up the rest as I go along.

My point about the motivation is that learning a language for your career may seem like a logical thing to do but isn't particularly enjoyable. Language learning can be a chore sometimes and if you can't enjoy content in that language then you are setting yourself up for a failure. I'd say picks language you want to learn because you like how it sounds or you want to move there and start learning it!

Yes, the translation is hyper literal and sometimes a bit wonky but with Indonesian it works quite well.  I use this method despite having both indonesian and English subs, because it lines up my subs and translation perfectly and automatically.

I'd suggest treating your language learning as a series of short term experiments... pick a method, do it diligently and consistently for a period of time you decide in advance (no less than 1 month, no more than 3) then re-assess how far you've come, what you feel good at now, what you wish you'd made more progress with, then make your plan for the next run. Learning how you learn, what works for you, what is painful and annoying to do consistently and what's fun for you etc, will ultimately arm you far better for future languages than just trying to dabble in 3 things all at once. For what it's worth, starting with spanish (as long as you're excited about the language or have some reason in your life why you want to learn it) might be a better place to play than hindi or mandarin, since you can extrapolate what works faster with a language closer to English without having to memorize quite so much to get to different stages in the journey."

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?   My sight reading is really bad and it took multiple takes for me to read it all without making stupid errors :("

languagelearning,3dco92,shkencorebreaks,3,Wed Jul 15 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"I thought this was really good. Other commentators are mentioning your accent, but the somewhat exaggerated pronunciation and kinda over-emphasis on things like the tones actually works well enough in formal/official texts of this nature. But then if you slip up a bit, it stands out more than it usually would. I'd actually rather hear you say something more casual and conversational before making a judgement call on your pronunciation. There are places where you falter a bit, like the 天 in 天安门, 主 in some instances of 社会主义 and the last vowel part of 强调 and on the 中国 at the end of the first sentence, and you do occasionally sound kinda like a tape recording, but officialese like this usually does, so that's okay here. Again, overall though, this was really, really good.   Big however is what you're doing with pinyin 'x.' This sound is different from both English 'sh' as well as ш, and probably the best thing to do is keep reminding yourself that there's always an inherent pinyin ""i"" sound following it, regardless of the syllable final. This is true of the entire j, q, x series, and you miss it a bit on some q's, like the 去 in ""去世之后,"" but with your x, the initial does need a tad more effort. You do sound a little better when the i is present in the pinyin, like with 下 and 现, but definitely work on it with x and this series in general. There's something slightly off in what you're doing with 家, etc. Pinyin 'z' is also different from z/з, where ц is like ""ts"", pinyin z is ""ds."" I get the feeling that you're probably aware of that, though- issues like the 泽、天 and 宣 and something about the 'height' of the 一 all in the very first clause threw me off right at the beginning, but then things got a lot better as you got into it, so you might have just been settling in at the start."

languagelearning,3dco92,Ayadlav,2,Wed Jul 15 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"I think you sort of round out the syllables? Maybe practice more slowly and focus on getting the uh...straightness of the sound. I don't know how to explain it, but I think English has a lot of vowels that kind of shift halfway through. Like your mouth changes shape through the vowel. For example, just saying the vowels, especially a, o, and i, you'll notice that to get a similar sound from Korean, you'd use two vowels.   Also be careful of the consonants that sound similar but aren't really. My name is 김주현 and I spell it Chu Hyun Kim but really, the sound is more like Ch/Ju Hyun K/G(ee/i)m.   But honestly, your accent is pretty good. English-->Korean is really hard and if I don't speak Korean for a while, I pick up a slight American accent too."

""Uss"" is singular while 'Un' is plural and (I believe that) you're referring to the boys as a group.  But your accent is really good. It doesn't sound like a 'Gora' (White Guy) accent at all.

In particular, your th could use improvement. In the first sentence you used a ""z"" sound for ""that"" and I noticed you also pronounce ""the"" as ""da."" This video might help. You want to try and pronounce these as the second voiced ""th"" sound.   The other sound might want to work on is ""v,"" which you pronounced more like a ""b."" To make a ""v"" sound your mouth should be exactly the same as an f, but you need to vibrate your vocal cords. This video is pretty good too. I've also noticed you pronounce ""will"" more like ""vill"" so this video should help with that too. Your ""r"" and ""l"" pronunciation is really good, but I noticed you pronounced the L in ""equality"" as an ""r"" so be conscious of that.

I think the most important thing to focus on would be the stresses in words.  Russian (even more so than English imo) really depends on getting the stresses right, which gives it that ""roller coaster"" sound which natives have.  Examples:  You said:  слава богУ (should be слава бОгу) с гордОстью (should be с гОрдостью) людИ (should be лЮди)  I understood everything though and honestly if you know 70-80% of the words in every sentence of Harry Potter you're probably a bit higher than A1, so congrats!  Also, regarding stresses - I speak only Russian at home with my wife and have been practicing for years and I STILL screw up stresses, so.... don't stress about it.  :)"
languagelearning,3dco92,dulti,2,Wed Jul 15 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"telgerot has already pointed out your stress mistakes, so I won't be going back to it. Just want to emphasize that the only way to crack the stresses is to listen as much as you can. No memorizing will ever do the trick.  You have a pronounced accent, which doesn't in the slightest impede your communication. I have understood every word perfectly (even the few mispronounced ones).  There is a general feeling as if you are trying to deliberately put on the proper accent and you end up speaking like a Hollywood Russian baddy :)   I'm not a phonologist, but I know this much: whereas vowels in English vary in length and 'effort' you put to pronouncing them, Russian vowels only vary in the lip position. Some English sounds (like long a, as in father, or long o, as in ball) are originated at the back of the mouth cavity, other sounds (short counterparts, as a in nut or o in top) originate in the middle. All Russian vowels (even ы) originate closer to the lips. I think you might try the following: when pronouncing Russian sounds, try using your hand to fix your jaw in place, from below and from the sides, so all 6 vowels (а, э, о, ы, у, и) are pronounced with jaw locked in place, slightly relaxed. Only lips move, but never stretch them like you'd do for 'ee' in 'teeth'."

You have a good pace, but you're doing something with your syllables that sounds... agglutinative, and might want to spend more time listening to how the ""flow"" works in sentences in native Korean speech, then focus on imitating that a little more. The way you're timing your syllables, this is a lot better than the typical accent from English, plus your pronunciation is really good in general, but you're still missing those classically Korean vowels, 어 and 으. They're not being distinguished enough yet from 오 and 우. With 어, it's a rather rare sound worldwide, so you're just going to have to listen to it more and get to imitating it. A little help with 으 might be that the letter is supposedly designed to represent the shape of the mouth when you're making this sound, so try to pull the corners of your mouth outward from each other in a straight line, instead of rounding your lips a little for that ""oo"" sound that you don't want to be making here.  But your biggest and most immediate issue (and one you can fix right away) is with ᄉ. This only sounds like ""sh"" when it's followed by an ""i"" sound, whether 이 or a diphthong that adds a y glide to the base vowel. When there's no ""i"", ᄉ just sounds like ""s.""

At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth."

It sounds like you're managing the Spanish sounds alright - speaking of which, nice job on the trilled rr in perro!   One thing I can recommend is to be careful where you put the accent. For example, it sounded like ""follé"" and (edit: I listened again, changed my mind) ""está"" were pronounced with the emphasis at the beginning instead of the end.   Another thing - and I'm sorry if you actually did this and I just didn't catch it - but words that have a single r (like ""ahora"" and ""follar"") should get a tiny trill. It doesn't have to be big like in perro, it can be subtle, it's really more of a tap than a trill. It's just that when I heard ""follar"" it sounded like an English r, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth. For the single r you'll want to do the same motion as you did for perro, with the tongue going up and touching the roof of the mouth - just don't hold it for as long.  One last thing, just for grammar: ""gusta"" should be ""gustó"" to match the tense of ""follé"", and muerto is always paired with estar, so in this case ""está muerto"" instead of ""es muerto"".

Thank you for pointing it out!   and muerto is always paired with estar, so in this case ""está muerto"" instead of ""es muerto"".   Ser and estar can get so goddamn confusing. Isn't being dead permanent? Shouldn't it be ""ser""? Anyway, I'll take your word for it.   But like I said, it seems like you can make all the sounds, and you sounded pretty confient - nicely done!   Thank you so much!"
languagelearning,3dco92,svatycyrilcesky,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, that makes perfect sense with the mike and the r! It's a bit of a subtle sound, it would be easy to get lost in recording. I couldn't quite tell if it was the r or the audio, but I figured I'd include an explanation just in case it might be helpful.   I'll try to explain ser and estar,  I think the etymology might be helpful. ""estar"" comes from Latin ""stare"" which means not ""to be"" but ""to stand"". Originally it applied to things like position and mood and pretty much anywhere you could plug in ""stand"". My Latin is questionable so I'll use the Spanish equivalents, but for example ""estoy de pie"" = ""I stand on my feet"", ""estoy triste"" = ""I stand sad"", ""estoy en México"" = ""I stand in Mexico"".   Meanwhile, ""ser"" comes from Latin ""esse"", which means ""to be"".  You'll notice that ""esse"", the real Latin ""to be"" verb, is the root of words like ""essence"" and ""essential"". That might be a helpful way to remember the difference: ser vs. estar isn't permanent vs. impermanent, but rather essential characteristic that defines the subject vs. interesting detail that doesn't define the subject.   (Spanish reading practice time! but I'll translate if you'd like) What the RAE's manual has to say about ser is that ser ""no describe exactamente un estado permanente, sino más bien una propiedad que se atribuye como característica"". For estar, it says that it's not just position or mood, but it can also mean ""un cambio en relación con su recuerdo o con sus expectativas . . . o el resultado de un cambio de estado"" (37.5.1b, for reference purposes).  So for example, ""El cielo es azul"" = ""The sky is blue (as a general fact)"", while ""El cielo está azul"" = ""The sky is blue (right now, yesterday it was rainy and tomorrow is an eclipse, but right now I perceive it as blue"". ""El joven es alto"" = ""The young man is tall (this defines him)"", as opposed to ""El joven está alto"" = ""The young man seems tall now.""  For exceptions to test the rule, we say ""estar muerto"" because being dead or alive is seen as a minor technicality rather than something that defines you. Julius Caesar ""era Romano"", ""era un general"" , ""era un dictador"", ""era popular e influencial"", but ""está muerto"" - he just happens to have not been breathing for 20 centuries. He changed state from living to dead, but nothing that defines him as a person has changed. The banana ""está  maduro"" - it had a change of state from young to ripe, but the banana itself didn't change, it just aged. ""El piso está limpio/seco"" - no floor in the history of the universe has ever counted on being clean or dry as an essential attribute! In the other direction, in the Hail Mary prayer, ""the Lord is with you"" is translated as ""Es Señor es contigo"" - in Catholic thought, God being with Mary isn't a detail about physical position but is rather a fundamental attribute defining Mary from the moment of conception, so it gets ser.   Ser vs. estar can be tricky, I hope this was helpful, but please let me know if there's still confusion or if this only made it worse, I'd be happy to help! EDIT: fixed some typos"

Apart from the enunciation issue you're understandable, which is good. A couple quick tips if you're looking to improve your accent though:  し should sound a bit softer, like halfway between an English ""sh"" and ""s"".  Try relaxing your lips completely when you pronounce your vowels. Ideally most of your lip movement should be from the consonants, and the vowels should just kinda fall out of your mouth lol"

Also there are blur  words here and there. I think most Japanese native speakers would be able to understand what you want to say, though.

languagelearning,3dco92,hoffmania1,2,Wed Jul 15 09:14:28 2015 UTC,"For heaven's sake, everyone is talking about your syntax and hardly anyone is mentioning your accent!  I'm not a native speaker so take this with a grain of salt, but it sounds to me like your vowels are what makes this segment ""gringo-y."" There's one point where you say ""hablar"" using the vowel from the English word ""ham"" when you should be using the one from the English word ""father."" At other points, you pronounce ""e"" using the vowel from ""egg"" instead of the vowel from ""face"" (kinda). Make sure you stick to the Spanish way of doing things.   A lot of people don't know that ""e"" and ""o"" in Spanish aren't quite the same as the sounds in English ""face"" and ""so"". English ""face"" uses a vowel that starts out sounding like Spanish ""e"", but gradually evolves into the sound from ""pin"" (in the IPA we would write ""face"" as /feis/. Similarly, English ""o"" starts out as Spanish ""o"" and ends in the sound from ""should"". To sound more Venezuelan, you need to cut these extra sounds out of your vowels. (In technical terms, you're using diphthongs when you should be using monophthongs).   Intonation is also an issue here, but I don't know enough about it to give you helpful advice. All I can say is that you should consciously try to say things like a Venezuelan would (which sounds obvious, but I know I've forgotten to do this a few times).   Best of luck!"

languagelearning,3dbk3v,waxlrose,14,Wed Jul 15 09:36:13 2015 UTC,"If you can figure out how to work as a freelancer (graphic designer, programmer, web developer, marketing consultant, personal assistent, etc.) you can pretty easily move and live somewhere where cost of living is much lower than it is where your clients live. Hitting a few thousand a month isn't all that hard once you master a valuable skill and get good at drumming up clients, and that amount is more than enough to live in a ton of other non english speaking countries. Even a fraction of that is even, depending on where you want to live.  Of course, as someone who actually went that route and figured out how to make it work... it's an assload of work up front, and not at all as easy as the 4 hour workweek might make it out to be. Don't even get me started on Chris Gillebeau crowd and all that bullshit. Either way, the lazy need not apply. If you do decide to go for it though, once you figure it out it's nice having a little more freedom than a 9 to 5 allows.   Also, translation work if you have the right connections can be done. I know someone that translates German for the UN remotely, and another person that does Korean translation work from home... I don't know much about getting into all that, but I know that can be done too potentially."

If I remember the story right though, she got the job by knowing the right people... which often changes things. The best way to get any job isn't with a resume after all, but as someone personally that's not all that well connected, I wouldn't be able to rely on much of that, haha. Same with most other people here I imagine. What are you doing now?

languagelearning,3dbk3v,galaxyrocker,7,Wed Jul 15 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of different stuff at this point. In High School/College I was doing 3D art for advertising using Lightwave... I've done a lot of basic websites at this point, and helped clients put together some basic email autoresponse systems to help with their marketing. The main things I've focused on at this point though, is helping businesses get into the 7 pack (the little map with the pins on it when you're looking for local businesses in your area) and setting up and optimizing Google Adwords campaigns.   If you're interested in being a programmer/web developer guy... I guess the first thing is deciding what you're good at and what you'd like to be doing as part of your job. Getting clients is a pretty big deal, and it can mean a lot of talking to new people, staying very organized, making appropriate deadline promises... basically a whole lot of communication and project management stuff in addition to actually doing the work you're interested in. If that stuff sounds like something you're willing to tackle (in addition to withholding money for taxes, handling quarterly tax payments, plus other details of running your own little business I may be forgetting) then I'd suggest you read a few Dan Kennedy books. He's not exactly a super healthy individual in a lot of ways, and you really only need to internalize a few really important pieces in what he's got to say, but unless you master those few basic things, it's going to be a pain in the ass to figure out how to market yourself. The gist of it though... figuring out where the connection is between the service you're offering and what it is that your clients are actually looking for, learning to automatically start looking for what your potential clients are worried about, what they're afraid of, where they've gotten burned in the past, and how to ask the right questions to open up the real conversation. Maybe even (ideally) how to package your service so that you're not just a web developer, but a supplier of some custom solution to a huge problem in a particular industry. (In other words, figure out how to build something for one client that's so awesome, that other owners will want to buy exactly that too). That's getting a lot more complicated to make work, but ultimately more lucrative and easy to sell once you get there. You can definitely make it work as a developer in the more classic sense too, just know that if you haven't done this kind of a thing before, you might find you struggle with going after the lower paying projects or cutting your prices to try and get the job, but ultimately those lower paying jobs are harder to get, and your client will often respect you less... the lower end work is often much harder to actually do, oddly enough.   If I was you starting out... I'd start by doing my level best to network with and get to know related providers in your area. Graphic Designers and developers that do wordpress style sites especially will be good to know, since they often have no idea how to handle more technically demanding projects, but do get clients that need that sort of work from time to time. I would also decide on a specific industry to focus on. Oddly enough, a portfolio is often not as useful as you might think, unless it contains mainly projects similar to the one you're bidding for. Most clients aren't going to have the ability to connect the dots and imagine what your work for them is going to be like if they're seeing projects in your portfolio that are very different from what they're hiring you for.   I'd also highly suggest finding a mentor. Go to industry events, call local providers and tell them you're thinking of getting into this and wanted to buy them lunch and learn a little about how they got started etc. Some won't take you up on it, but if you make a dozen calls you should be able to meet at least a few people. Industry events are radically easier to meet people in though, so make sure you do that too. Either way, get someone to help you not make the stupid mistakes, and advice you on how to handle some of the difficult situations that are going to come up for you. You don't want to figure this stuff out on your own, if you fuck it up badly enough in some areas you can even expose yourself to lawsuit.   Alternatively though, if all you want is a job you can work remotely so you can travel... you can get a job at actual companies that will allow you to work remotely. I've got a number of friends that do that, and it seems to work alright for them, though I've never looked for or made work any situations like that before.   Anyway, sorry for the huge dump, but like I said in the first post you were responding to... getting rolling with that sort of a thing can be a huge uphill climb, especially if you've got any limiting emotional stuff going on that needs to be worked through too, in addition to honing your skills."

Vowel-harmony doesn't bother me at all, in fact- it sort of makes Hungarian easier to pronounce since you stick to the same quality of sound.

Naturally, for me, Spanish/French/Italian haven't been too hard. Arabic is fairly easy too for someone who speaks Hebrew fluently, particularly if you focus on a dialect like Lebanese (Standard Arabic is harder but still Hebrew helps a lot). Learning Persian has been fairly easy too because it has so many Arabic loanwords so I could guess meanings, and I don't find it very complicated anyway.   Hindi/Urdu and Greek have been much more of a challenge. Hindi/Urdu should be much easier to me than they are - they're Indo-European and have tons of Arabic and Persian loanwords.

For some languages you could pronounce the words correctly by reading them if you knew what sounds the letters represent, but English is not one of those languages.

Sure, they say the grammar is easy. But the pronunciation is already a huge pain in the ass. I struggle with both listening and speaking. I won't even start about the tones. In fact, reading the characters is the easiest part. I still love the language. Knowing the characters and being able to read a news article and grasp the gist of it is really rewarding.

languagelearning,3dd4u8,Trinoxtion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"I grew up speaking English and Russian at home, but I think Thai is the hardest language I've been faced with yet because:   It is tonal The tones aren't very distinct The alphabet (which is not a true alphabet but an abugida) has 44 consonants but only 21 distinct consonant sounds. Most Thais, if you ask them about a word, won't be able to tell you the tone because it's based on a combination of consonant class (high, middle, low), vowel length (short/long), and final consonant sound. So unlike Mandarin where the tones are very distinct and easy to parse, Thai is much more convoluted and the natives usually can't tell you which tone a word is. Makes for interesting mistakes. Many people (in bigger cities at least) won't really try to understand you and will just assume you can't speak Thai because you're white, which is frustrating.   Grammar is pretty straight forward though, which is nice."

German pronunciation rules (from my so-far-very-limited knowledge) seems to be much more regular than english... so the real trick is just getting used to what sound they make, they always make pretty much the same sound regardless of surrounding letters (except for some vowel combinations, like Häuser and such).   You can also start listening through spoken German with a pdf in front of you to practice reading/listening and get the sounds in your head. Lingq and graded reader audio books are both good for that.

My Mom has Alzheimer's and has been in either assisted living or an Alzheimer's nursing home for many years now. Most of the bilingual residents still seem to speak and understand English—well, at least as much as they are able to speak and understand language in general. More than forgetting their language skills they seem to lose the ability to know which one to use, especially when they are initiating conversations. Things get a bit jumbled. I've seen frequent conversations when they start off speaking French, for example, and then after a bit of confusion switch to English when they realize the other person is speaking to them in English.  I have seen a couple of residents who seem to no longer be able to speak English but in both instances, their native language was pretty dominant and they only came to the US as adults.   Sadly, with Alzheimer's, language skills in all languages deteriorate. My mother still speaks a lot, but it's all nonsensical these days.

languagelearning,3d7qmh,Flip101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"Well, as a Uralic language, it's quite different from the other languages I've learnt so far. Different words and pronunciation wise, there is one letter that I had trouble with at first, the ""õ"", which is pronounced /ɤ/.  Grammar is also quite a bit difficult, especially the cases, because there are so many cases (14, as far as I know), and they have more than one usage, and endings. For example, ""Ma lähen poodi"" means I am going to the store and ""Ma lähen koera"" means I am going to the dog. As you can see, the ending for the ""to"" changes, and that happens often. So, you often have to remember each form for each noun.  E: The normal forms for store and dog are ""pood"" and ""koer"", and I don't know how accurate my translation is, because I still haven't quite figured out the cases and endings"

I only got to A2 level during the first 3 years (reading/writing was probably a little better though), and this last year I can confidently say I've made my way to a B2 level. This is because I did not really have the drive to improve until this year since I have so many Spanish speaking friends to practice with now. I studied French for a month, but decided to focus on Portuguese first. I can surprisingly read a fair amount of those langauges and infer the meanings of words because of their relations with Spanish, but producing the langauge in Portuguese and French is a whole different story. Hopefully I'll be able to call myself A1 in Portuguese within the next couple weeks once I start to ramp up the studying."

languagelearning,3d6337,ricksteer_p333,14,Tue Jul 14 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"'Être à' = belongs to.  You need to learn 'à' and 'de' in the context of the verbs they accompany, and not necessarily in isolation.  Edit: I'm learning French at the moment, and am literally learning this stuff, verbs + 'à' or 'de'. You just have to keep practicing them, reading them, looking them up, again and again and again and eventually it just becomes natural.

So I'll literally just find a list of verbs + à and verbs + de (sometimes like penser, they appear in both lists) and I'll use reverso.com's context section to find real French example sentences that use those phrases.   I'll then make two anki cards:  Card 1: - just to remember the phrase (read it to myself in my head or outloud; try using it in a different sentence)  Front:  Penser à  ""Il faut penser à la retraite.""  Back: Penser à  ""Il faut penser à la retraite.""  Card 2: Now I have to try and remember what fills in the blank space '__', à or de in this example.  Front:  Penser __  Il faut penser __ la retraite.  Back: Penser à  Il faut penser à la retraite.  I'd obviously make a card with 'penser de', and do the same thing. Eventually you practice these enough using SRS in Anki and you'll remember them by heart.  Hope that helps."

languagelearning,3d457a,Toasterbag,8,Thu Jul 16 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"Also - I have a question for native speakers, if there's any out there.  So I heard once that since I'm not Jewish, I'm pretty much not allowed to try and learn/speak or take an interest in the Yiddish language.  Is this true - is it a language so closely tied to the Jewish culture/religion that for outsiders to try and speak it isn't appropriate?  Or do most Yiddish-speakers not mind other people giving their language a go?"
languagelearning,3d457a,Aietra,12,Mon Jul 13 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"Certainly bizarre. I'm not a native speaker, but I am Jewish and studied the language in Jewish school for several years (not that I can speak it very well anymore), so I have a bit of a connection with it - it's also my maternal grandmother's first language, despite her being born in Saskatchewan, Canada. I can't imagine that any Yiddish speaker or (acculturated) Jew would take offense at a non-Jew learning Yiddish, so long as they aren't the sort of person to take offense at everything anyway. I know that when my great-grandfather lived in Minsk (now the capital of Belarus), which had a Yiddish-speaking Jewish population that ranged from 30% to almost half of the entire city between the 1890s and 1940s, he had many non-Jewish friends and business associates who could converse in Yiddish, just as he could converse in Russian.  You may find hostility in very isolationist Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities that continue to speak Yiddish as a first language in places like Brooklyn and Jerusalem, but I'd think that would stem mostly from a general distrust of outsiders and a desire to be left alone. I can only imagine that those Yiddish speakers who are integrated with North American (or wherever you might live) society would be overjoyed to have anyone interested in learning the language, Jew or not, and I can promise that's the case at least for my grandmother. Speaking for myself, as a Jew with a strong interest in Jewish history and heritage, I say not only should you go for it, but you should proclaim your efforts proudly and teach as many people as you can about the language!  EDIT: Just as an addendum, there are many words, phrases, and idioms in Yiddish that do rely on some knowledge of Jewish customs and traditions to understand, but there's no reason you couldn't learn about those at the same time, too."
languagelearning,3d457a,Zhankfor,2,Mon Jul 13 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, so it's not a common view to the whole language/people worldwide, then - but caution and cultural sensitivity would be advised for some more closed communities?  That makes complete sense!  Thank you very much for your insight and point of view!  Yiddish is one that's tentatively on my to-do list, but I wanted to be sure I could approach it with the right sensitivity and respect."
languagelearning,3d457a,Aietra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And anyway, if you're an outsider to one of those communities, you're unlikely to make the inroads necessary to practice speaking with them in the first place. Obviously there are exceptions, but as I said, those communities as a rule are very insular."
languagelearning,3d457a,Zhankfor,9,Mon Jul 13 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"So I heard once that since I'm not Jewish, I'm pretty much not allowed to try and learn/speak or take an interest in the Yiddish language.   No.  Yiddish isn't even any sort of universal language of the Jewish people.  It's a cultural phenomena of some European Jews.  Jews of other regions have their own languages and dialects (Ladino, Bukharan Tajik, Judeo-Arabic, etc).    Even Hebrew in Israel isn't only spoken by Jews.  Israeli Muslims and Christian and so on also speak Hebrew, which is much more the liturgical language of Judaism than Yiddish is.    I bet that many Ashkenazi Jews would be happy you're taking an interest in their culture and language."
languagelearning,3d457a,thebabscrazyfangirl,5,Tue Jul 14 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"So I heard once that since I'm not Jewish, I'm pretty much not allowed to try and learn/speak or take an interest in the Yiddish language.   no not at all true, I studied yiddish at a summer program at the university of vilnius and the vast majority of students there weren't jewish. there was even a guy from saudi arabia.   Obviously it is not going to have the same cultural meaning to you as it does to us and it is even going to be a little hard to understand  not knowing jewish culture. but absolutely no one will have an issue with you studying it in fact in my experience most jews tend to get super excited whent hey find a non jew who knows yiddish since so few jews let alone non jews care enough about the language."
languagelearning,3d457a,daoudalqasir,4,Tue Jul 14 07:10:13 2015 UTC,"In the Yiddish summer programs where I go, there are young non-Jewish persons from different countries (Poland, Russia, Ukraine and others), looking for a part of their countries culture that is missing, and they are really welcome. I mean, some old people sometimes mind it, but it's really only a few people.  Edit: and, of course, a lot of non-Jewish people are interested in klezmer music and learn songs, which are really part of the Yiddish culture..."
languagelearning,3d457a,caribouchat,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"I did a project a few years ago that involved interviewing native speakers of Yiddish. Basically, both views do exist -- some people believe that the Yiddish language has a ""spirit"" that cannot be properly learned by non-Jews, and that non-Jews ought not to attempt learning it for that reason.   However, this view is by far in the minority. Most Jews would be perfectly happy to find a non-Jew learning the language, especially given that, in secular communities at least, its existence is in dire straits. Many prominent Yiddishists today aren't Jewish.   At any rate, even amongst the people who think non-Jews shouldn't learn Yiddish, I did not get the impression that they'd be that offended. The vibe was less ""How dare you appropriate our culture,"" and more ""Oh fine, if you really want to, go ahead."""

These tribes have requested that their language stay in their tribe (because it is so linked to their culture). They agree to let us record their language (for science) under the assumption that only members of the tribe will actually speak it.  For them, attempting to speak their language without growing up in their culture is blasphemy because of the religious and cultural baggage attached to the language."

languagelearning,3d6a6w,gabe2068,17,Mon Jul 13 21:21:26 2015 UTC,"I had that problem. To be honest, I grew out of it. It's almost inevitable you're going to waste a lot of time, because you need to change naturally. My main advice would be to just do your best and stick with one language, but don't be afraid to jump around. This is supposed to be a fun and rewarding process, so to a degree you need to follow your heart, even if your heart if fickle as fuck.  I'm 23 now. I decided I wanted to take language learning seriously when I was 20, but even then I would commit to a language for only a month or so before quitting or jumping to the basics of another one.   It wasn't until I planned a trip to Brazil for the World Cup that I really got focused - so yeah, having a goal helps. I spent a year and a half consistently studying Portuguese. Anytime I felt lazy, I'd at least try to get in a Duolingo lesson or read a small article - anything to preserve continuity on a day-by-day basis, even if it didn't involve a full 30 min or hour study sesh.  Now, a year later, that stuff comes more naturally. I've basically grown out of my ADDness with languages. I'm better at the consistency and the focus - though I'm not immune to distraction. I'll sometimes pick up German or French for like 2 weeks before remembering that with the amount of time my job takes up, adding more languages just isn't sustainable and the long-term reward of sticking to one (or maybe two) is worth it.  The worst thing you can do is nothing. As long as you have a passion for languages, I'm confident you'll find the right path - even if it means you learn how to say ""hello, how are you"" in 20 languages before you can have a real conversation in any one haha"
languagelearning,3d6a6w,matwat22,3,Tue Jul 14 00:27:03 2015 UTC,"The advice I usually give is if you have multiple languages that you're generally interested in, then do actually study both/all of them, don't worry about if it's too much. Then, however, if you find yourself enjoying the study of one more than the other, don't fret about dropping the other one (and maybe picking it back up later if you regain interest).   For most people on this sub language learning is a hobby. Many seem inclined to discipline themselves into making progress in certain languages before moving on, but I personally find that a very unenjoyable constraint when the point of a hobby is to do whatever you like."
languagelearning,3d6a6w,Trinoxtion,3,Mon Jul 13 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"I used to have elements of that... I think for me, it came from a mix of wanting to 'escape' somewhere, and lose myself in something for a while, and the fact that new escapes tended to stop working as well after the first wave of excitement started to wane. For me it was all about this cycle of running towards trying to lose myself, flashes of getting caught up and excited and feeling 'on', and then longer periods of feeling more depressed, lost, stuck.   If I was speaking to myself 8 years ago, I'd point out that that tendency to follow one thing, then drop it, have a few days/weeks of feeling depressed and lost, followed by the next blast of excitement, was something that covered more areas of my life than just hobbies. The way out has had to do with learning how to find fulfillment from the slow and steady, and ultimately give up on the draw of the new and exciting. It's made a huge difference in my depression, I have a lot less of it... but I don't get nearly so excited about new things anymore. Kind of an evening of the board I guess... I think personally it's a fair trade. I can pursue long term goals much more easily, but it's been a long time since anyone's seen me light up and go on fire in the same way I did a decade ago.   Also, last quick note. You're likely not passionate about learning any one language, or maybe even not learning languages in general. You're probably more passionate about taking in new information, starting new things, and forming initial birds eye views of things. It's a useful skill, and it might just be that you're mistaking your draw for what it really is."

languagelearning,3d6a6w,jujukg,5,Tue Jul 14 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you like the idea of learning a language. I'd say, pick a language and on the day you're motivated, find someone online to chat with. Even if you can only say ""hello"" (even if it's copy-pasted). You then have a real life person to attach that language to. Might be less inclined to pack it in if there's someone there. If after a while you don't like it, try another language, but do the same thing.   Certainly, for me, speaking with the Russian speakers that I've met, and who can't speak great English, is a massive motivating factor for me."

I suddenly develop a liking to a language and I have a surge of motivation to learn it, and then I either get bored or find another language!  I think the best thing to do is pick one or two languages based on the resources you have, the uses you'll get out of it, and whether you like it.   For example, I wanted to learn Korean and Swedish but I realized Russian would be far more better suited to me as I can speak a Slavic language, understand Cyrillic, and my dad speaks Russian. There are also a lot of good Russian resources out there."

Find a goal. Find people, movies, books, music - really anything that connects you to the language you are trying to learn. Without purpose it is difficult to keep up the discipline needed for learning."

languagelearning,3d7gda,ElitePowerGamer,4,Tue Jul 14 02:49:22 2015 UTC,"If you really get technical, you can come up with an absurd number of rules in english too. In my experience, learning the basics of verb order, tenses and vocab is enough to begin learning the rules without much explicit study, simply by using the language frequently (reading, speaking, etc).  If the alternative is memorising grammar rules from a textbook or app, I would simply never be able to stick with it - I find it so boring. The only time I do it is when I find I cannot express something important, and I need a new explicit grammar construct to do so."
languagelearning,3d7gda,dinosaur_of_doom,3,Tue Jul 14 03:42:00 2015 UTC,As a heritage speaker of a language it is so hard to try and study up on a language that you're kinda sorta fluent at.

languagelearning,3d5zqa,fabrik2,3,Mon Jul 13 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"Do you have a real need to progress to a C2 level? I ask because that's pretty demanding. One explanation of C2, for example, states:   The capacity to deal with material which is academic or cognitively demanding, and to use language to good effect at a level of performance which may in certain respects be more advanced than that of an average native speaker.   If you want to progress to that level, I'd suggest that you find a well-educated native speaker who would not mind helping you prepare for one of the CEFR C2 exams. Even if you don't plan on actually sitting the exam, this can be a great way to focus your efforts. And write! Find some of the the example writing topics for C2 exams and prepare yourself so that you could complete the written portion of the practice test with only pen and paper."
languagelearning,3d5zqa,Luguaedos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"I do think I have a real need, professionally as well as in my personal life. I have been hesitant to pay for a C2 course because it would be a bit too expensive for me, but I think I do need to make a focused study effort.  Part of me worries that I have reached my highest capacity to learn a language fluently... there are people who never master a language, despite living for 10+ years there."
languagelearning,3d5zqa,Luguaedos,2,Tue Jul 14 11:25:46 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but I'd argue those people never actually put forth the effort to get to that level. But I do think you need to manage your expectations. I have a friend from Spain who works at a local university. He's professor and very clearly is what we'd consider a C2 but his speech still marks him as a foreigner. He speaks clearly and articulately and does not make errors in grammar but no native speaker of English could ever be fooled into thinking that he was a native speaker of English himself.  I really want to emphasize the importance of writing to get you to that level. You essentially need to put yourself through a high school level language course and then at the very least through a 101 university level course. I don't think you need to enroll in C2 course, per say, but you do need to sit down and come up with a 4 month plan to get you to that level and have a native speaker that can help you out. Honestly, it should probably be 2 native speakers with somewhat different backgrounds. I'm in the process of doing this with Italian but at the B2 level. While the objectives might be different I think the high-level strategic ideas are the same.   Set a time period that is long enough to get the work you need to do done but not so long that you kill yourself with the effort. 3 to 4 months max. Gather your materials and make a plan regarding what you are going to do during your working period. I'd make sure that you are doing things like writing essays on current events, formal letters of complaint to a political figure or a company, book reports, etc. And make sure you are presenting a subset of your essays and book reports orally to your native speakers. The native speakers should be able to ask you hard questions about the topics you present and really put you on the spot. Remember that the CEFR levels are about what you can do in the language not what you know about the language. To reach a C2 level you have to prepare yourself to function at that level via practice. You cannot just go through an exercise book, you've got to do the things the level requires again and again until you do them well. After the 3 to 4 months or whatever time period you decided on has elapsed, you should look back on what you did that worked well and did not work well. I think this part is really important. Take a few weeks to really think about this. Figure out which aspect of your studies over the past few months were the most difficult for you and then do the process over again with an emphasis on those aspects. If something hurts, then do it until it doesn't hurt any more.   I don't know your background at all, but you've mastered your native language so you clearly have the capacity. So there should be no reason you cannot master a second. You just have to do the work and then reflect on your effort so as to improve your efforts in the future. From the people who live in a country for 10 years and never mastered the language show me on who read the classics in the language, wrote book reports on them, wrote essays like they did in their native language in school, and gave presentations. It's a lot of hard work. Most people don't do this unless forced to in school or in their profession so most never achieve the level of skill in their L2. You can't grammar book and Anki your way to C2. You absolutely must practice writing, reading, and speaking at that level or you'll never get there."

I find myself spending more time reading.   Although, I have a Kobo reader. There are downloadable offline English dictionaries for French, German and Spanish. It does a pretty good job of showing the gender of nouns, it's meaning and synonyms as well. For verbs, it shows the verb in infinite form and it's meaning.

I use Anki for vocabulary and feel that I have certainly retained vocabulary which I would have forgotten otherwise. I generally just add words to a deck when I come across them and don't understand their meaning, as your deck matures the amount you need to review decreases. I don't think I spend more than 10 minutes a day reviewing words.    Certainly think you can succeed without Anki, but I feel it's a useful tool. I don't particularly enjoy it either but I feel it's useful for retaining vocabulary, particularly infrequent words. But if you don't enjoy it, I would say drop it and work with resources you do enjoy. Life is too short to be slogging something you don't enjoy, particularly when it's not essential."
languagelearning,3d2rmf,Talked10101,6,Mon Jul 13 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"In the beginning and advanced stages I think it's pretty irreplaceable, but in the intermediate stage it's probably better to glean most of your language skills from media and conversations."

languagelearning,3d2rmf,twat69,3,Mon Jul 13 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"You don't have to give it up completely if you don't want to, just reduce the amount and devote more of your study time to watching television programs, chatting with language partners, reading books, or etc~  You could even switch to creating your own decks from new words that you encounter instead of using pre-made lists."
languagelearning,3d2rmf,itsudatte,2,Mon Jul 13 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"I understand why flashcards are useful in the beginning and less so as an intermediate, but what happens to make them useful again at the advanced level?  Is that for technical vocabulary?"
languagelearning,3d2rmf,krnm,10,Mon Jul 13 06:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah~ in the advanced stage you won't be running into nearly as many words you don't know in the wild anymore, so it becomes much less efficient to wait until you encounter something you don't know to learn it, especially if it's the kind of word you only hear a few times a year."
languagelearning,3d2rmf,itsudatte,4,Mon Jul 13 07:17:08 2015 UTC,It's all up to you and how much you think you're getting out of it. If you don't enjoy it you're probably not going to stick to it in the long run and the benefit will wain due to lack of interest.

languagelearning,3d2rmf,donadd,2,Tue Jul 14 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"I think that once you are at a high enough level, you are better off just focusing on actual novels, movies,  newspapers, and so on. After all, the words in your anki deck are presumably there because they occur in books, movies, newspapers and so on. Words you encounter in the wild - especially those you encounter multiple times and in different contexts - will always 'stick' better than words learned from an anki deck."
languagelearning,3d2rmf,feedmefeces,5,Mon Jul 13 05:09:52 2015 UTC,But you can make your own anki deck with the words you have encountered in books and newspapers.

The married/grown up life tends to leave a lot of side hobbies/projects dropped. I have one like that... except it's mental baggage and haunts the hell of out me for me leaving it.  Then again, I wasn't burnt out with it. Work time & life circumstances are my... excuse.  In my case, I kind of regret it.  If you do give it up, make sure you have a fruitful pursuit to take up next. Otherwise, you'll feel more emptiness. And you will be bothered with ""what ifs"" whether you like it or not.  If you don't, you need to find a way to really add it into your daily routine - and I don't know how. That's up to you. It doesn't seem like you're hellbent on fluency/mastering it - no goal (thus, ""why am I doing this"") - so give yourself a new channel/goal. Do a German language blog (why the hell not) or a YouTube channel.   One thing that you do have on your side is time & persistence. You clearly put a lot into German. And, w/enough time, you're guaranteed to get good at something. I'd keep that in mind - whether you keep on or quit.  I don't know. If you stick with it, find a new purpose - something that bears fruit. Whether $, expertise, etc. Either way works if you're willing to put up with what ifs, mental nagging."

languagelearning,3d0a5i,Coz7,8,Sun Jul 12 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know German, but I used to feel this way about english. I live in an spanish-speaking country, and I learned english when I was 14. From there on I only used to ocassionally browse forums like reddit until I was about 26.  When I was 26 I got the chance to travel to the U.S.A.. When I got there, people told me they were surprised I could speak it so well compared to others (I still had a few glitches). The person who invited me to travel then, invited me again 2 years later. Now at 30, I recently had a job interview, and even though this is a spanish-speaking country, the first question during the interview was  'in your resume it says you speak english fluidly. Can you explain what you mean with that?' it turns out that even though it wasn't mentioned anywhere, they instantly reject people who don't speak decent english.  Speaking another language, any language, specially one like german, will open great opportunities you didn't even know, even if it only happens every few years. You CAN bank on knowing german, from time to time I encounter articles related to my profession that are only in english, and they give me an edge over non-english speaking competitors. Though rare, I find visitors from other countries that do not speak spanish well, and being able to understand their english even if I don't reply in english puts my above the baseline. Even just the mind-opening experience of learning another language is worth it.   If you don't use german much, find ways to make it profitable. Knowing multiple languages IS worth it if you know how to use it."
languagelearning,3d0a5i,Paradoxa77,6,Mon Jul 13 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"Well, what is the point of learning the language? If you don't have anyone to talk to and nothing to read or write, you don't really get to use it. That's not a big deal... it's just part of life and language.   Why did you learn German in the first place? If you're getting frustrated, there must be some sort of desire in place that got you started. Why not try isolating that feeling and seeing if it can be directed toward something else -- another language, or another skill/hobby. That sounds like the best course of action.   Alternatively, you can try a hobby that utilizes you German skills, like writing a blog as another Redditor suggested.  I don't know about you, but me? I can't get enough languages. If I were in your situation, I would dive right into the next language. I'm currently studying Korean in a university, but when I don't feel like writing Korean papers or watching Korean documentaries, I practice the (hard-as-fuck) Thai alphabet. It's a blast."

I also wanted to suggest something. Do you write a journal or similar? Perhaps you could start writing a daily journal in German, so it remains part of your life. You could even make an audio journal (recording yourself speaking) if you would prefer to do something speaking-related.  I wish you all the best in getting out of this rut and finding that purpose you're searching for."
languagelearning,3d0a5i,SamterdiaMan,6,Thu Jul 16 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"Still, doing a journal or anything similar in German won't last much if she can't find a purpose or a goal. While I'm not exactly in the same situation as her, I can totally picture myself going through that. I even very often think I'll have to move to a more multicultural place in order to keep with my language learning hobby. Sure, there are some languages that I'd like to learn just for specific purposes (like learning Swedish so I could watch Ingmar Bergman's movies without subtitles), and others because I just find them really pleasant, but there are also some languages that, although I really like them, I can't picture myself learning for no reason other than talking to native people (particularly smaller languages or dialects, like Shanghainese or Swiss German).  You guys may hate me for saying this, but I can't see no reason to struggle trying to keep doing stuff in German if she has no reason to do it. And I'm not saying that you should only learn a language if you have a goal, but a reason, and doing it because you find it cool/pleasant is a very valid and legit reason."

There isn't a lot of material in German that can't be already found in English, and I don't really plan on traveling to any German-speaking countries anytime soon, so... Bragging rights are cool and all but it doesn't really make up for the time invested.   Anyway, I see a lot of people here are suggesting making a YouTube channel or a blog, which is a great idea, but be aware that both are very time consuming and that it's hard to become noticed nowadays, even more so when it comes to a narrow audience.   You could also try working as a freelancer translator on your free time, it's a competitive area but you've already got the experience you need."
languagelearning,3d0a5i,Nicsamgy,3,Sun Jul 12 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"The statement that there's not a lot of material in German that can't be found in English is patently false.

Really, at the early stages of learning a language your brain is rewiring to understand the new sounds of a language. This process takes a lot of time and exposure to a lot of material. Even if you don't understand what is being said, it's still helpful to simply consume the sounds."

Obviously, you need to listen a lot, which shouldn't be a problem in this day and age; secondly, speaking the language, to others or to yourself, allows you to get a feel for it and easier recognise sounds made by natives as they speak.

I recommend you:  Rip the CDs to MP3 files. Listen to the conversation from the lesson while reading transcript. Don't worry about any grammar oral exercises.  Make sure you understand the conversation as much as possible, looking up words you don't know. Listen again.  Put all the conversations on your phone or mp3 player. Listen to the conversation and the next couple of  Conversations while on your commute. Don't listen to the same conversation more than twice a day. Make sure each conversation is listened to without transcript at least ten times. Rinse and repeat. If you are feeling keen, use the conversation as a Dictation exercise, stopping and Replaying sections and typing it up in a word processing document. Check against the transcript for missing words and errors at the end. This is hard work so half an hour a day doing this max is plenty. Ten minutes a day is fine. Rinse and repeat for some months.  If you have a course with audio, and work with it I his fashion I don't think you can go wrong. Eventually move on to simple audiobooks and native speaker stuff for kids and so on."

About learning Thai, I lived in Thailand for 8 years, and originally went there as a missionary.  Because of that, I learned thai with the aim of evangelizing, and so that shaped my language experience and the operating principles of staying there- I didn't spend time at hotels or with people who spoke english, for example.  It's a very long story, but the short version is that after about a month, I was able to get around, say hello, make light conversation about limited topics, and after about 4 months I was more conversational.  But those were a shitty four months of having nobody to talk to in my own language."

My foreign friends have a really hard time understanding the concept, specially if they come from very pragmatic places like Germany, Scandinavian or Asian countries.   I heard this definition somewhere: ""ahorita"" is the mexican measure of time to determine something that may or may not happen anywhere between right now and eternity."
languagelearning,3cy9wq,TheFrigginArchitect,2,Sun Jul 12 04:40:43 2015 UTC,Do you think the English 'soonish' is analogous to ahorita?
languagelearning,3cy9wq,Lo_88,2,Sun Jul 12 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"mmm not really. I think it would be if ""ahorita"" was used literally, but no. ""Soonish"" is in the ""right now-later"" time lapse, while ""ahorita"" could easily mean never. In my opinion, this is directly related to the very particular Latin notion of being on time as something incredibly relative, I don't think that's something acceptable or even existing in the English speaking world."

The French because they either expect you to speak it perfectly, native-level, like they do, or not at all.  Don't you dare ""butcher"" their precious little language.  I've heard qubecois can have a hard, hard time in France because of how they speak and that many of them resort to just speaking English and pretending they don't know French.  The Japanese because - and this isn't most of them, just some, but enough that it's noticeable and annoying - they will...get this...they will pretend you dont't speak Japanese (even when you obviously do), as in you'll be standing there speaking to them in perfect, native-level Japanese, and they'll be saying ""Uh...what?  I don't understand...I'm sorry...what?"" and if they speak English they'll want to switch to that because of course it's not possible that a foreigner could speak fluent Japanese."

Their language is melodic, they pronounce words in a nice pitch, and if you're not a beauty-oriented person, it is very useful as Swedish is sort of like the power house of Scandinavia (although, surprisingly, Copenhagen has almost single-handedly caught up to them).    If you're just looking for keeping that change, then English, which you clearly seem to master, is excellent as apparently Danes are the second-best at speaking English as a second language. They will understand that, unlike German. If it's very Swede-oriented, those guys seem to be having a great relationship with the Finnish and apparently they seem to understand all of their noises close to the border and this includes Stockholm.    Lastly, holy tits, German. You are a tea drinker, aren't Germans, like, the perpetual tourists?

languagelearning,3czlw2,potentialhijabi1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a native English speaker who used to travel around a lot working on farms for a month or so at each, and I met fellow backpackers from just about every corner of the globe.  Usually, they had maybe a few basic phrases of English at most, and would mostly learn the work by watching and physical demonstration.  But when they did try to speak some English to me, I loved it!  I just adore seeing people trying out new languages on native speakers - it's, like, look at us bridging cultures and communicating, this is awesome!  I would then help them to learn more English words, and they would tell me their own language words for what I was showing them - and in general, they seemed outwardly equally enthusiastic about my stumbling attempts at their languages as I was to theirs.  I've learned all sorts of odd bits and pieces that way...I can give the recipe for a horse tonic in German, come out with a few scattered words about milking cows in Chinese, say a few food items in Afrikaans, a nursery rhyme in Japanese, answer the phone in Korean...  So those people, if I can remember them all, included...-thinks-...French, German, Spanish, Brazilian, Danish, Swedish, Afrikaans, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese...  I think the only ones who didn't like me trying to speak/learn their languages (and therefore I stopped) were one Chinese person, and the Vietnamese person.  Maybe I just spoke it so badly that it was awkward?  I expect in general, though, it depends more on where you find/meet people, than what language they speak.  Backpackers travelling the world and trying to learn about other languages and cultures themselves, I think are going to be more enthused about the general idea of language-exchanging than, say, someone working in a shop who hasn't travelled and is a bit over tourists.  I've also heard of the odd language whose speakers actively discourage other people from trying to learn it, and don't like outsiders taking an interest in it.  One being Yiddish, the other being Māori (controversially, this last - some Māori people will say that white people aren't allowed to speak Māori and it should be exclusively for those of Māori race; while others want to promote the language to as many as possible, and want the use of it to become common throughout New Zealand to preserve it, because it's endangered)."
languagelearning,3czlw2,Aietra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"When I first started out with Spanish, I noticed a lot of people pretending I hadn't said anything to them in Spanish and speaking English with me, or even saying ""I speak English"" in an offended tone. I used to really take it to heart. Now that I speak fluently, I can just go up to any random Latino looking person and speak Spanish to them and they usually don't care. They just talk to me like a normal person having a conversation. I do get asked a lot how I learned Spanish though. (Speak it at home with husband and all day at work) I still get some people acting like super offended when I speak Spanish to them or even trying to use English when they can't speak it nearly as well as I speak Spanish but they are few and far between and I just see myself in them and let it go. That's just their own insecurity. It's a politically charged issue imbedded with issues of racism and socioeconomic inequality that I'd be happy to go into more if you don't know what I'm on about! (You probably do though)  Mam Maya is a little different. When I talk to strangers it really confuses them because almost none of them have ever met a second language Mam speaker. Many of them have already heard of me, which honestly makes me feel pretty famous! Sometimes people decide to switch to Spanish with me, either for similar reasons to the Spanish/English thing or because their Spanish is much better than my Mam but usually people are very patient with my mistakes and are happy to speak Mam with me. When I speak it at work, people rarely ask how I learned what I know of it. They're just there to tell their stories and get their papers taken care of, and if they say anything, they just thank me for speaking to them in their language.  Overall I find Mam speakers more welcoming for learners than Spanish speakers, but once I got past the wounded ego phase for the most part, I just let less welcoming exchanges roll off my back."

The second link seems to be the best one.  You should not focus on one language at a time. The earlier the child is exposed to a language the better. From the second link:   Learning languages during the ""critical period"" is essential to reaching native speaker fluency even when the language learner is presented with multiple languages. It is thus better for the child to learn multiple languages simultaneous through exposure as their language centers will naturally differentiate target grammars.   And regarding the fear of confusing the child:   The only consequence of this parallel learning is that they'll lag slightly behind their mono-lingual counterparts in shedding some of the grammar errors that all children exhibit when acquiring any language. They will also have some level of linguistic cross-influence that will, again, be shed once they've acquired adult fluency."
languagelearning,3d05fn,averagemonkey,4,Sun Jul 12 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"It is true that babies who grow up speaking more than one language tend to have delays. But that's okay. Your kid will catch up eventually. They can adapt. There's no reason to ~wait~ to introduce one language. Just do what feels natural.  However, make sure only native speakers talk to them. If your bf is not a native English or Tagalog speaker, don't have him speak to the baby in that language. The baby will soak up all his mistakes and accent. Think of second generation Chinese immigrants in the US if you have encountered them. They tend to have a Chinese accent even if they hardly speak Chinese. It's because their parents talk to them in English. I also think it's better for you to not speak Igbo around the baby for the same reason.  Edit: Obviously, sometimes you have no choice since there must be a common language. Pick language that the non-native speaks best."

I would not say that this affected me negatively in any way. It definitely wasn't confusing, I always understood that they were three separate languages.   But since Igbo is not your native language I think it would be a bit weird if you were speaking it with your kid. For example, my mom speaks Russian too, which is how she communicates with my dad, but she would never speak Russian with me because it's not her native language, and that would be super weird.   So I would basically say that while you definitely should learn Igbo, maybe don't speak it with your kid. That, I can imagine, would be quite confusing."

I'd use the 98% rule of thumb to see if it's a fit for you... if more than 1/50 words or so are new, then it's too tough, otherwise just get some favorite books on tape and start listening while in the car.   Also, I'd suggest getting a kindle. It can fit in a lot of pockets, meaning you can get at least a little bit of reading done during those random 5 to 10 minute intervals that pop up semi frequently in the course of life.

But... yeah, only so many hours in the day. Sounds to me like it might be time to cut some things out of your life for a while to make room.

The words are easily understandable because you can guess the context quite well, especially in news programs.   I usually watch TVshows when cleaning the house and doing laundry (20-40 min) It's extremely helpful for learning new vocabulary because you see and hear words, if you have subtitles, you also read and context is provided as well. But that might not be an option considering your lack time."

Flash cards done by hand may be ineffective.   Using a Spaced Repetition System such as Anki is very effective  to retain vocabulary. Note that nobody claims you'll learn a language just by doing flashcards. But it's great to retain vocabulary.   If you're learning a language without using a SRS, you're doing it in hard mode."

Native speakers can slow down their speaking and repeat things whereas in other mediums this isn't necessarily possible.   If you absolutely hate the idea of talking on skype/some other sort of voice thing with someone else, just do a lot of listening. You can look up topics and create arguments based off of them, too. Speak them aloud. Speak as much as you can, although without a native speaker there it's hard to get feedback for any errors you might make (if you care about that)."

languagelearning,3cvkx7,shkencorebreaks,2,Sat Jul 11 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"Not much beyond that it exists, unfortunately. When I saw your post, I had the same initial reaction /u/Boxterr did, that whatever ""românésci"" means, it's possibly related to what's going on with the word românește, which is an adverb meaning ""Romanian-ly,"" as in ""[to speak] in the Romanian fashion."" It's based on the adjective românesc, where -esc is the same Romance ending known best in English as ""-esque.""   Given the fact that the spelling ""românésci"" doesn't seem to exist with any kind of wide currency, and now seeing that your friend wants this to mean ""he/she knows Roman,"" my guess at what's going on here is that for either his own reasons, or as a cultural feature shared among speakers of this particular dialect, there's an overly-enthusiastic drive to assert the dialect's particularly ""pure"" or ""ancient"" character. At least coming from Romanian, the form of the word ""românésci"" is immediately glossed as above like an adverb. The word ""ști"" means ""to know,"" and (again, in standard Romanian) the third-person present form is ""a știe."" Again, I don't know this dialect (or even much Romanian- my background is in ideology and nationalist narratives and I do my thing here in China, where it's a matter of pride for certain speakers of certain dialects to go a little bonzo sometimes over claims that their particular dialect preserves the ""single, true, original mother tongue"" or whatever with the greatest purity, etc), but it just seems like a bit of a stretch to read the -ésci as ""a știe,"" ""he/she knows"" instead of as a more logically apparent adverbial suffix. The choice to use the spelling ""românésci,"" plus the decision to read ""român"" as meaning ""Latin"" instead of the more accepted ""Romanian"" seems to be personal preference on his part as well. Granted, the -eshti in ""Rrãmãneshti"" does at least feel like it could be doing something along these lines, and phonetic features of the dialect could be making this connection easier to fudge. Still, the verb's not exactly where you'd want it, and the suffix looks just as much like -ești, which is commonly used to form proper nouns as a place name marker: București: ""Bucharest,"" named after a mythological dude known as ""Bucur."" This, in turn, is just the plural of the adjectival suffix -escu, as in ""Ceaușescu."" So there are a ton of these adverbial and adjectival suffixes around, and none are related to ""a ști."" If things work differently in Aromanian dialects and he's got the etymology to back it, then more power to him. Again, not my area, and I could be way off, but that's how this all kinda comes across."

languagelearning,3cshlt,delta_baryon,3,Fri Jul 10 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"I think my favourite is how it includes Glasgow and Edinburgh in the same ""dialect"" area. Because obviously there is absolutely no difference at all in dialects between the two. That and they keep spelling Gàidhealtachd wrong and only seem to use it for certain areas.   Not to mention that apparently almost all of Ireland have the same dialect of English. Like if they're going to just list it as English, they could at least have included all the different dialects."
languagelearning,3cshlt,Brenhines,2,Fri Jul 10 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"Are they using the Irish spelling, perhaps? Gaeltacht? I had a look at the map, but couldn't see it."
languagelearning,3cshlt,delta_baryon,2,Fri Jul 10 18:30:20 2015 UTC,"They're using Ghàidhealtachd so they've lenited it without including the definite article. They use it to label a random area in the south of Scotland and then for the area around Inverness but just label the islands and most of the west coast as Gàidhlig which seems really odd.    That and not including any different dialects, I can understand not doing any for Scotland, but I know that there are some very different Irish dialects and you'd think at the very least they'd distinguish between North and South Welsh."
languagelearning,3cshlt,Brenhines,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Well, the funny thing is that, according to the map, South Wales apparently speaks English and the upper 3/4 just speaks Welsh. I mean, it's more like a patchwork isn't it? You have a majority of speakers in Gwynedd and significant minorities in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire.   Same for Gaelic presumably. I don't really understand what they've done wrong with Gaeltacht. Can you give a quick explanation for someone who doesn't speak the language?"

languagelearning,3cshlt,delta_baryon,0,Fri Jul 10 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's not applied inconsistently. It prioritizes minority languages, primarily major ones. That's why Irish is shown in the gaeltacht and Lower and Upper Sorbian shown in Saxony and Brandenburg."
languagelearning,3cshlt,adlerchen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:39:59 2015 UTC,"Right, it shows the modern distribution of Irish, in the Gaeltacht, but shows the historical distribution of other minority languages such as Cornish (arguably a dead language) and Occitan (critically endangered and almost entirely replaced with French)."
languagelearning,3cshlt,delta_baryon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"It does that because otherwise it would have no where to show these languages at all. With Irish, there is a stretch of land where it is the majority language, so it they represent it there. With the other languages you mention, there is nowhere where they are the majority language, so they get represented in their historical homeland. Again, the priority is on minority languages. They get preference for being shown, and in areas where they are not the majority language."
languagelearning,3cshlt,adlerchen,-4,Sat Jul 11 11:19:27 2015 UTC,"because Irish is still English while, almost every Italian dialect is different from Italian, same is Occitan dialects in France, while still maintaining the main language as French and Italian. seems to me that you mistake accents for dialects"

languagelearning,3cshlt,adlerchen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:45:56 2015 UTC,"The reason for that decision is to be informative of the amount of languages that are spoken in a generalized area. One would always have to make compromises in making such a map, because in reality there are no land stretches of land where 100% of the people there only speak 1 language at all and no others. This map prioritizes displaying minority languages. You can fill in the blanks yourself since you probably know what the majority languages are and where they're spoken."

languagelearning,3cu1s6,ElPanaChevere,16,Fri Jul 10 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"This is due to these two factors (among others):  1) Listening and speaking (as well as writing and reading) are related but separate skills. Capacity in skill A can influence skill B, through for example word knowledge, but there is no automatic transfer of ability. Each skill has to go through its own developmental stages and that means actual time and work on that skill.   2) Listening and speaking are also very different language abilities and draw on your knowledge of and exposure to a language in fundamentallly different ways. Listening is receptive while speaking is productive. They make use of your internal store of words, meanings, phrases and grammatical knowledge in very different ways."
languagelearning,3cu1s6,acutia,9,Fri Jul 10 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"To piggyback or elaborate on what you've mentioned: In terms of language teaching and learning, segmenting courses into separate language skills was very pre-Communicative Language Teaching (CLT). Now there is much more of a push toward skill integration, with a focus on meaningful communication. One school of thought is that production and reception are simply two sides of the same coin; you can't have one without the other. One skill reinforces the other; we learn to speak based upon what we hear, we learn to write by reading, etc. There are a variety of approaches that instructors use (I won't get into here) to reinforce this such as Content-Based Instruction, Task-Based language teaching, and others. Also, within each skill are separate sub-capacities or skills. An example for listening might be distinguishing between literal and implied meanings (a macroskill) vs. being able to recognize stress patterns or words in stressed/unstressed positions (in English) (a microskill). These ""sub skills"" do not develop necessarily at the same rates or levels. Additionally, the terms productive and receptive are used when referring to different types of vocabulary. You are in receptive control of the words that you understand when you hear them or read them. You are in productive control of the words that you use to express yourself, in speech or in writing. So, it's pretty complicated, really, and there are many theories that go pretty deep into SLA, which would be way too TL:DR for here.   Sorry, I totally rambled on there. I have my Master's in this subject."

languagelearning,3cu1s6,LyssaB,2,Fri Jul 10 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"Actually in this case, it doesn't really have anything to do with tones! It's really just practice and skill. I can understand Cantonese pretty fluently, and although my accent is pretty good, my speaking skills are subpar compared to my listening comprehension. This is because I didn't speak it enough growing up, and I didn't speak it exclusively at home, but I heard/hear it every single day. I have lots of friends who understand Cantonese well enough, but they grew up responding to their parents in English, so while their listening is fine, they cannot speak it at all."

This isn't really the case though, because I (and my friends, and probably MeestorGomez's teacher) grew up with it, alongside English.  It's not so much a second language in the traditional sense IMO. In the case MeestorGomez described, I'm willing to bet that their teacher couldn't speak Cantonese not because it's difficult to learn to speak correctly, but because she didn't bother to/have the opportunity to practice it to fluency."

languagelearning,3cu1s6,Dilectalafea,5,Sun Jul 12 06:44:28 2015 UTC,"I was like this with Spanish for a while. I take classes at my high school, and last year my teacher typically only spoke in Spanish with us. I noticed I was totally fine understanding, but we were only allowed to speak Spanish during class. That was very difficult at first for all of us, but the more we spoke, the easier it became.  I think this is pretty common, especially if you don't speak a lot, because speaking and listening are two different processes. The more you practice speaking, the easier it will come to you.  Additionally, it was probably easy to understand Italian because you could make connections to the other languages you know that are similar. But because you don't have any practice with Italian, speaking is more difficult (don't know correct vocabulary, grammar, etc)."
languagelearning,3cu1s6,Ruunsan,5,Fri Jul 10 20:25:18 2015 UTC,"I think that's quite normal.  In fact, even children understand much more of their mother tongue than they are able to say.  Eventually, through trial and error they learn to speak.  I think it is probably the same for you.  You just have to practice and risk making mistakes.  That's what's so hard for adults.  Kids make mistakes, get corrected and move on.  As adults, we don't like making mistakes and being corrected, so we don't try."
languagelearning,3cu1s6,Ruunsan,3,Fri Jul 10 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's quite natural, considering you can speak both Spanish and French already.

(Quick warning - it's a significant step up in complexity from Harry Potter, though I haven't read HP in German in a while)  I'd recommend ""Momo"", which is also written by Michael Ende.

Congrats on your milestone too, fun to come back and be able to enjoy books you were only working your way up to at one point.   And yeah, I think the German in the first Harry Potter book at least was pretty simple, but it seemed to get more challenging as the books went on. I think Rowling was changing her language to reflect the age of her readers as they grew up... or maybe she just grew into her craft a little more, who knows. Either way though, I read the first chapter of die Unendliche Geschichte yesterday, and I only had to look up a few words... so it's very comfortable so far, but who knows what'll happen in the book next? We'll see! And yeah, I've heard recommendations for Momo too, I'll definitely check that out too, either after this book or after Siddhartha."

I think the audio books that went with them tended to have a fairly slow and clearly enunciated reading too, which helped. As far as reading goes, I'm extremely fortunate to have found german graded reader: Erste Stufe right off the bat. I think I paid $25 for it, and it was worth every penny. If only most graded readers were like that, but ah well. It was brilliant, and incredibly helpful. The audio books though were just practice fodder, something to quickly wade through to connect the dots to native material, since my vocab from reading had already gotten up to where that was possible. Just needed to get an ear for things first somehow.   Haha, and yeah... I think learning the adjectives is going to be one of those things that's just going to take a ton of practice, so it won't ever start to get natural I think until it's a part of of my life... and since I don't speak it or write it every day, I haven't made much headway yet.

If they don't, it's usually because I'm misremembering the word or saying the wrong thing, not because I can't get the right sounds out of my mouth.  When I was self-studying at home, I would compare my voice to recordings from my textbooks, and did a lot of shadowing. After coming to China, I mostly mimic people here. Plus, it's very easy to tell from their reactions if my pronunciation is off, because they will have to think about it before they understand, if they understand at all.  Just curious, which dialects do you consider difficult to pronounce? Easy?"
languagelearning,3cu5pk,nonneb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"For me, Shanghainese would be easy. Mainly, dialects that are similar to that or common mandarin are easy for me to understand and pronounce. Wenzhou dialect, Suzhou dialect, and Cantonese are three dialects I've had experience listening to that are quite difficult to understand or to pronounce. But mainly, it's opinionated.

Then I found LingQ, which isn't exactly structured, but I can somewhat measure my progress.

languagelearning,3ctqv4,jlemien,7,Fri Jul 10 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do my entire language learning with a tutor as that's...very expensive like you mentioned. I self study and also take classes at my uni for Japanese.  I personally would search around this sub for resources for those languages, try a bit of self study, and ask around here or in the language specific sub for questions.  Tutors are obviously amazing resources, but there are some things you can do for free. Just make sure you aren't developing any bad habits. Tutors are awesome with speech practice if you're a beginner as many native speaking conversation partners wouldn't really have the patience. I know itaki has both professional tutors and community tutors who you can get for cheaper than $15-$20 when the time comes and you want/need a tutor. Some even have their own lesson plans or follow textbooks while others are more free form with what you want.  Short answer: No you are not required to have a tutor to learn a language, but they can be nice for some things if you can afford one."
languagelearning,3ctqv4,araradia,7,Fri Jul 10 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"In contrast to /u/Tgheidi... everyone learns differently. The vaguely autistic among us (me included, haha) love studying esoteric bullshit alone for hours on end, and finding new systems to make things more 'efficient'. There's plenty of others though that by far learn best from a teacher, or from a Pimsler style listening course, or even (though it's definitely a lot less bang for your buck in my humble opinion) a classroom type class in a local community college or something.   If you already know that you'd love learning from another human being instead of starting with Duolingo or something else, then by all means go for it. After all, it takes thousands of hours to master a language, but language learning comes in phases. The first phase is kind of like... how to get enough of the basics under your belt, that you can actually start using the language, instead of just preparing to use the language. A tutor combined with some anki use might actually get you past that first stage in 10 weeks, with an hour a week making up the core of your studies... it's possible. From there depending on your interests, you can either start reading appropriately easy material, or listening, or conversing, or writing on Lang-8 or with a penpal of some sort. After all, as soon as you can start using the language for fun, it ceases to become this difficult onerous task, and just becomes a regular part of your life. Hours just add up then, without you paying for them or setting aside time, or even thinking about it at all.   Before hiring a tutor though... get clear on what you'd actually like to use the language for. What's your 'end of phase one' you need to actually hit, before you can start actually using the language? What would your 'goals' be for after your first 10 weeks? Do you want to be able to start reading your first book? Do you want to be able to start haltingly watch your way through shows? Make a new friend? Talk with your russian speaking grandma in her native language? You can share those goals with your tutor then too, and work with them to make sure you're actually going to hit them, and that you can start easing into your 'phase 2' activities as soon as you're ready, whatever those things might be. You might find that a once a week tutor session is great for keeping you on track, in which case you might just want that as a part of your life for the first year or two even, or maybe you find you just needed a leg up to get started, and from there you've got it on your own. It's fine to experiment.  If your real problem though, is that you don't know how to approach learning a language, and you want a tutor to hold your hand... your time might be just as well spent by getting a copy of 'fluent forever' and reading through it. It's a little fruity, and he's got a major hardon for spending hours making his own cards in anki, which honestly isn't going to everyone's cup of tea... but a lot of his stuff works fairly well for me at least, so if all you want is a road map to start with, then give that a go and see what happens."
languagelearning,3ctqv4,adventuringraw,5,Fri Jul 10 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"I am actually a private English teacher...  Tutors help you by: a) pointing out the specific grammar points you need to work on b) showing you how to correctly pronounce the sounds of the language c) being patient while you speak, no matter how slow or boring the conversation is d) correcting written work that you do and giving feedback on it e) providing (some) consistency to your study habits  I would recommend learning grammar and new vocab on your own. Then, add in a one hour session once a week where you do the things that only a tutor can provide: a) have a conversation where the teacher doesn't interrupt you with grammar corrections (have the teacher write these and tell you at the end), but does feed you words when you don't know them b) reviews your pronunciation and helps you master the sounds of the language c) reviews written work that you've done during the previous week  Another piece of advice: you are the ""boss"". While you should of course show respect to your tutor, if they aren't providing what you want, don't be afraid to find a new one. And don't get too discouraged if the first two or three don't work out. Finding the right private tutor for you can really help out a lot in the end."

languagelearning,3crtfm,TheNroar,8,Fri Jul 10 06:51:54 2015 UTC,I teach at a fairly unconventional English school. Teachers are allowed to focus on pretty much anything we like. I focus on giving students confidence and mastering conversation skills. I do this by spend the first 30 minutes (of a 2 hour class) by having conversation. If there is an awkward pause I wait for them to continue the conversation. Can get fairly awkward but I've seen them improve heaps over the last 3 months.

languagelearning,3crtfm,Ozark,3,Fri Jul 10 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm new to language teaching, so I'll share my limited experience.  I've taught a beginner's French class at university twice.  1) The first thing I do is find out my students' reason for learning French and how much experience they have with the language already.  In Canada we have many 'false beginner's', but as a university we have students from other cultures where French is completely new.  Knowing these things lets me plan my lessons accordingly.  2) I tend to focus on building vocabulary, basic sentences, and correct pronunciation.  3) Make it fun! I start every class with conversation (they can use questions from the board), we play games, have contests.  As most of my students are native English speakers, I compare a lot with English.  As for things to be avoided... I made the mistake the first time around of insisting too much on written exercises."
languagelearning,3crtfm,Brawldud,3,Fri Jul 10 13:14:01 2015 UTC,What is a false beginner? Someone how already knows the language well but is enrolled in a beginner's class anyway?
languagelearning,3crtfm,Ozark,4,Fri Jul 10 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"No, that's called a cheater! ;p  In Canada most English speakers are false beginners of French because we are surrounded by the French language: almost everything is displayed / announced in both official languages, even in places where only one is spoken.  A false beginner has slight knowledge of a language.  As an anecdote, I was shocked a couple weeks into the course when a true beginner (a student from Japan) asked me about two words I kept on using as he did not know what they meant.  The words were ""Oui"" (Yes) and ""Non"" (No).  For a Canadian not knowing these words is unthinkable."
languagelearning,3crtfm,ElPanaChevere,3,Fri Jul 10 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"I used to be a Spanish tutor at my university.  I think the most important thing is that they should want to learn a new language for the right reasons. To have fun, be able to talk to friends and have that personal connection, business matters, etc. Not just to pass a test for a required class.  They should focus on vocabulary and being able to communicate/understand things. I think nowadays, we enforce grammar way too much. In truth, grammar will come naturally in due time. You can have bad grammar and still be able to communicate yourself.  Ideas that I like to use is find cognates between one's native language and the target language. That just opens up tons of vocabulary for the speaker to use in conversation. Also, don't try to translate everything literally. Otherwise, a French speaker wouldn't be driving you crazy, but that they'd make you ""climb the curtains"" (grimper les rideaux)  Do not translate things literally, as pointed out before. Don't put it off. You'll forget things and become less fluent. Your motivation is an absolute key in this.   Another thing that I might add. Put everything in your target language (social media sites, your phone). Watch something for five minutes. That's still better than nothing. Go to sites like SharedTalk or Babbel and find a native speaker who is trying to learn your language. You'd be surprised how much you learn from them and not from a traditional classroom setting.  You're welcome/ De nada :)"

If you want to talk about astronomy or the Greek financial crisis or your team's chances in the Gold Cup, that I can do.  For that reason, I find that language exchanges are a lot easier if I keep up on the news and have some ideas for what we can talk about."
languagelearning,3covex,krnm,5,Fri Jul 10 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"The trouble is when you're a beginner at a language you don't really learn higher level economics vocabulary or niche hobby vocab!

languagelearning,3covex,araradia,3,Fri Jul 10 19:22:37 2015 UTC,"True, but hopefully that stage doesn't last too long.  By the time you've finished your beginner's program, hopefully sooner, you should know enough to more-or-less understand news articles or blogs.  With the help of a translation addon like Readlang or Lingua.ly, you'll be able to read about things that interest you and learn that vocabulary."
languagelearning,3covex,krnm,2,Fri Jul 10 21:13:58 2015 UTC,My struggle is: why learning a language when I am not going to use it to talk to people. And this is probably why my speaking skills are lacking in every single language I speak.

languagelearning,3cs557,therealow,7,Fri Jul 10 09:37:37 2015 UTC,"In spoken English, yes, we use it all the time. People rarely say ""there are"" unless they are stressing something, for example if they want to stress the existence of something: ""there are ..."", or if they are trying to speak very clearly. [Note: this applies mainly to American English and in particular to what I'm familiar with. I assume that Brits do the same though.]  In written English it looks very clunky though. I wouldn't even use it in texting or informal e-mail since the 're contraction is almost only used for ""they're"".  There's some disagreement about whether contractions in formal writing are okay. The prescriptive rule is that you should never use contractions, i.e. always write ""there's"" as ""there is"", ""I'm"" as ""I am"", etc. This is a safe and conservative option, but I don't think that there is anything wrong with using some more common contractions even in formal writing. I get away with it all the time."

languagelearning,3cs557,DenseReals,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think there're is a contraction for there are.

languagelearning,3con2w,katiebelle13,4,Thu Jul 9 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm so pleased you like our language! As some learning tips, here they are:  1) Probably that was already told you, but never stop experiencing Italian. One thing I find a lot useful (for learning Spanish, but it applies to Italian too, maybe even better) is to listen to the national radio. They talk about everything in a very good Italian, and also not too fast.  2) If you haven't already, start studying the congiuntivo. When you'll be able to use it correctly during a normal conversation, it's the sign you're doing great into your study course. As Italians hear you, they'll recognize the British accent, because I think it's impossible for Brits to gain a perfect Italian pronunciation, but they'll hear your congiuntivo and they'll think: ""OMG she is so clever, and she got serious on studying!""  3) Never lose a day. Never. If you can study during the day, you MUST do it.  4) I'm going to reveal my secret. For me it's probably the best part of learning a language. Let me explain. I'm talking about shower thoughts: When I'm under the shower, my Italian disappears. I start thinking in Spanish and saying thing out loud in Spanish. That's incredibly useful because the things you think about under the shower are thing you care about, so being able to express them in your target language is important, and amazing!  If you don't do any shower thought (maybe you sing!), just pretend that instead of entering the shower you're entering in an Italian boutique and ask how much are the clothes, or that you've just took part in a job meeting, or anything you like, but in Italian.  5) I love to help people learning in Italian. I log in reddit almost everyday so if you're looking for any help in Italian just contact me and I'll be glad to help you. :)"
languagelearning,3con2w,PazEr80,3,Thu Jul 9 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of your advice! I try to study most days, and I also work for an Italian family teaching them English, so I get to hear them speaking Italian quite a bit. As well as everyone else around me. It is interesting to see, for myself, how quickly o have picked up a good part of this language in just a short time because of immersion and a short language course!   I always try to study new things, to broaden my knowledge of everything Italian, but I am afraid that when I go home, I will lose it.  I am extremely shy in terms of speaking the language, although I have become more confident in the last few weeks, because I am afraid of making mistakes, but now I can see for myself that even native speakers make mistakes and that was a huge realisation for me!!  Thanks again!"
languagelearning,3con2w,PazEr80,2,Thu Jul 9 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially for Italian, native speakers make maaany mistakes, and the vast presence of local dialects makes the situation even worse. It turns out C1-2 foreigners speak better Italian than us. Anyway, the Italian grammar is precise and logical, the pronounce is easy and always the same, as happens with German (and not like English where everything is f**ked up and I don't even know why), and also is a musical language and is full of latin references which makes it worth studying.  Just beware one thing. If the family you're teaching English to speaks his dialect, or even adopt their dialect's accent, let them know: you don't want to end up speaking neapolitan or piedmontese!  Keep up the good work! :)"
languagelearning,3con2w,PazEr80,2,Thu Jul 9 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"I hope I can make it to C2 one day, it really is a dream of mine. I didn't realise that I was picking it up so quickly until I started watching cartoons in Italian (giustin tempo mainly) and forgetting they weren't in English! I was so happy, I couldve cried!  The pronunciation and spelling is much easier than English and I've actually found myself struggling to spell English words at the minute because I am so surrounded by italian!  The family that I work with live just north of Rome, but they are quite well spoken and I don't think they speak badly, again, what do I know, im a foreigner! They help me a lot with the grammar but because I teach them English, I don't have  many opportunities to speak Italian with them for extended periods!   I still find it tough to speak to people who speak in dialect, or sometimes don't realise that im not a native and they speak with a lot of slang or something like that, but I am getting there! I hope one day I can be as good at Italian as you are at English!"
languagelearning,3con2w,Luguaedos,2,Thu Jul 9 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"Oh well I've never spoken English with a native speaker, and what a pity, because when I listen to English speakers, even if they're fast, I never miss a word. But anyway, I forgot to say that cartoons are awesome to practice the language: I remember the cartoons I used to watch when I was young (not long ago :P), here are some suggestions if you want to get relaxed a bit while absorbing Italian:  1) I Due Fantagenitori (perhaps The Fairy Godparents in English): it's not a cartoon for children, more for boys, I kept watching it until I was 13. They use a language which is simple yet full of occasionally used words which can easily enlarge your vocabulary.  2) I Fantaeroi (Sidekick in English) for the same reasons as above.  3) A tutto Reality! (Total Drama in English): kinda like a big brother but in cartoons. It's designed for early teenagers so it may be really helpul.  That's all. :)"

Lastly, I have read excerpts of ""L'écume des jours"" by Vian and if you don't mind looking up older words and figure out the Paris of the 1940s, it is an amazing read so far. The book has been ordered, too.    Furthermore, you are so right about experiencing. Watch some shows (Bref is my favourite, which is on YouTube).

languagelearning,3cmw34,sebasmr96,14,Thu Jul 9 03:36:19 2015 UTC,"My wife was probably B2 in English when we met. We live in Japan and have visited the U.S. A few times for a total of a few weeks, so very little time in a fully English speaking country. For a year, we listened to VOA's News in Special English every day and discussed it afterward. After that we spent a year listening to NPR for an hour every day and then discussed it. We also rented series after series of TV shows and binge watched them instead of watching local TV. Later she got into an English Masters program at the Japan campus of an American university. After completing that, she applied for the doctoral program at the same school. Part of the admissions requirements was the MAT, which is aimed at native speakers and she scored in the 96 percentile, meaning that even among native English speaking doctoral candidates, she is doing well.   She still has some grammatical peculiarities and an accent, but overall  better receptive and productive English than most college educated native English speakers.   So she went from B2 to pretty close to highly functioning native without being fully immersed. We did, however, create a very rich environment and she spent about half her waking hours with me speaking (and sometimes fighting) in English. So you could say that she was 100% immersed, 50% of the time. :)"
languagelearning,3cmw34,OsakaWilson,6,Thu Jul 9 09:07:18 2015 UTC,"but overall better receptive and productive English than most college educated native English speakers.   I'm sorry, but I don't believe that. She might have a better vocabulary, but if she still has grammatical peculiarities and an accent, I wouldn't say it's better than any native English speaker."
languagelearning,3cmw34,galaxyrocker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"For example, with her reading comprehension, she would have noticed that I did not say ""better than any native English speaker"" in every sense. :) If you want to define better as better in every sense, you'll find very few who would pass your test. For example, the average Reddit user would be better at Internet slang than Noam Chomsky, so he's out."
languagelearning,3cmw34,OsakaWilson,9,Fri Jul 10 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"But the issue is there's no way to be ""better than a native speaker"", generally. Native speakers are the standard which we measure ability against. Sure, they might not speak all dialects or the standard fluently (and internet slang, I would argue, is very much a sociolect), but they're 100% competent in their dialect. Noam Chomsky is, too, in your example. He just doesn't understand the sociolect of the internet. That's the point I was making."

languagelearning,3cmw34,bobdid,11,Sun Jul 12 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"Galaxyrocker, you might want to remove your English native-speaker flag   Because clearly I'm not a native speaker because I disagree with him.    because so many people happen to suck at their own native language,   LOLOLOL. That's exactly the point I was making: they don't suck. They speak their native language fine... they don't speak the standard fine, often, because - guess what - it's not their native language. It's a different dialect taught in school! And often taught very shittily.   So, maybe you should actually learn something about linguistics before you say people 'such at their own native language'. Native speakers are the ones who define the language, and that's why you can't be better than them... except, perhaps, in the standard form. Which, as I said, is often not their actual native language.   And, again, my point stands. If she can't speak 100% grammatically 'Standard' English, she's not better than any. But, I bet you're one of those who says ""I don't need nothin'"" is 'incorrect', despite being perfectly acceptable in several dialects, including my own.   or coming up with a plausible reason to troll, because really?

No, I'm not. I'm stating that standard English really doesn't matter, and that the man's wife will never be better than any native English speaker in their native dialect. What I am, saying, however, is that if the judgement is in standard English, which often isn't the native dialect, there could be a possibility, since, well, most don't speak it.    You've never met a child?    A child is perfectly fluent at around age 7. Yes, they might not be as eloquent as a college-educated speaker, but they can still express any idea they know, and do it fluently.    You've never met a heritage speaker who can barely speak their native language?   And oftentimes heritage speakers never spoke growing up, but only gathered it listening to parents. That's a far cry from learning all skills while growing up.    You've never met anyone who has literally let their native tongue wilt in favor of living in a different language?   Yes, but they'll gain it back with quick practice; they don't lose that native speaker intuition.    You've never met a non-native speaker who you couldn't tell was not a native speaker? Or, heaven forbid, got so great at their adopted tongue that they were shepherded into the halls of literature?   And I never said non-natives couldn't reach high levels of proficiency.

LOLOLOL. I'm from a rural area.    There are tons people out in the world like that, and get this: THEY SUCK AT THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE.   get this: THEY SUCK AT THE STANDARD FORM OF THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE, OFTEN BECAUSE OF LOW QUALITY EDUCATION. Which is what I've been saying.   Being precise or persuasive, sexy or funny or situation-appropriate are all skills that fall into the category of language ability   And I'm sure that all native speakers who are appropriately trained (see, a lot of this shit is education), know when to use the right register) and how to be more eloquent when they need to be. Just because they're not in normal interactions, and have no need to be, doesn't make them ""shitty"" at their native language.   Seems to me you're the one who doesn't understand linguistics, mate. After all, as I've said multiple times, it's the native speakers who define how the language is used. And I'm talking about every day life, not in academia or literature, as you seem to believe. Because, again, that's a different register, and often does require an education to learn the proper terms and whatnot."

You've got a big assed farm-boy chip on your shoulder there.  Some people are better at certain language functions than others. Some people don't develop it on their own (autodidacts ftw), some people aren't trained in it, and some people don't care about that stuff (rural areas & poor areas = higher %). But none of that changes the fact that some people suck at some stuff, and other people don't.  ""And I never said non-natives couldn't reach high levels of proficiency.

No, you don't. But, just because you can be funny, or more persuasive, or 'sexy' doesn't mean your linguistic competence is any better than those who aren't.    You've got a big assed farm-boy chip on your shoulder there.   I love how you assume to know so much about me... especially when everything I have said has been the standard of linguistics. EVERY native speaker is perfectly competent in their language. But, you have to realize, their language often isn't the standard, which, unfortunately, is taught as 'correct'. It's not anymore 'correct' than dialects... it's just 'standard'. And it's not a 'farm-boy' chip. It's a chip from someone dealing with people who literally have 0 knowledge of linguistics.    But none of that changes the fact that some people suck at some stuff, and other people don't.   Yes, some people suck at the standard language and other taught aspects (reading and writing); others don't. But a lot of that has to do with education. Rural areas and poor areas have a lesser quality of education, and the correlation is spitting obvious.  And, if you're going back to those skills earlier, a lot of that is taught. Some people just can't be funny; they could learn, certainly. But how funny you are has nothing to do with your linguistic competence. Nor does how 'persuasive' or how 'sexy'.   You're asserting that all native speakers reach high levels of proficiency. HA!   I'm not asserting that all native speakers reach high levels of proficiency. I'm asserting that native speakers are the bar at which linguistic competence is measured. Again, this isn't in the standard, but in their dialect, which they are the definers of.   And you're asserting that native speakers have 100% pure, unadulterated influence on how language is used. HA!   Yes. This is a very basic tenent of linguistics."

Right now I'm in high school and because of that my time becomes limited to learn a new language. I try to watch videos on YouTube of people speaking any language I'm interested in, and try to copy their pronunciation and expressions. Also I listen to music sung in the language and learn the lyrics and what they mean as to get an idea of how the grammar and sentence structure work. Certainly I don't have an organized schedule to do these things, I do them whenever I have any free time.  I know that's not the best way to learn a new language, but it's what I have at my reach right now."
languagelearning,3cmw34,Luguaedos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:57:02 2015 UTC,"I know that's not the best way to learn a new language   The best way to learn anything is the one you can actually do! Don't worry too much about perfect. And one of the big differences between a real immersive environment and one that you can create is the interaction. If you go to the store, you have to interact with people in the local language. If you need to get gas, you have to do it in the local language. In situations like that you get immediate feedback. If your grammar is wrong, they'll tell you (perhaps repeat what you said in the correct way) and the same with pronunciation. So the key thing is that try and get that by interacting with natives even if it's online via Skype. Another good way is to write a lot in the target and have it corrected. One of the hings I suggest is that you try to get to the point where you can write will with only pencil and paper. Don't use the Internet, no dictionaries, no help of any kind.    Write your text on paper (double space) and then go over it and make sure you correct any obvious errors. Copy your rough draft onto another page (or use MS Word or what ever BUT NO SPELL CHECKING!) and then send it to someone to correct. Take the corrected text and write it into a notebook.   IMO, the physical act of writing the first and last time is important. Lots of people neglect this kind of work but it's a very good way to increase your output in a target language and learning the set phrases and other linguistic devices you need to write a text will feedback into your speech. That's why you want to write it with no crutches. I'm actually doing this with Italian right now and I've found it amazingly helpful. I'm trying to write 3 texts per week (120 - 200 words) this way in Italian and I have noticed that my speaking is a lot less halted now and I don't need to think about things as much. It took me about 3 weeks of training to where I could write well at the B1 level with no digital assistance. Finding the errors that I commonly make with the basics of the language has been a huge help. I had to face the fact that I didn't know the conjugations of the basic irregular verbs as well as I thought.  It's all about the cycle of output + feedback and then integration of the feedback into your productive repertoire."

But, yes, a student who really wants to learn a language is not going to be stopped by mediocre lessons. I think that's why so many people come out of even university level lessons without a functional command of the languages they studied. You, personally, provide the perfect counter point. Even with limited access to classes, you put in the work with Irish and you find your own material and you keep going. Most people don't do that.

It depends a lot on the professor, the material, how hard you're willing to work, and your learning style. I could have learned Spanish in high school if I'd cared a little bit more (and how I wish I had).

The subtitles will help with associating the written word and the spoken word.
languagelearning,3cl5b0,iburnedparadise,3,Wed Jul 8 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"One of the challenge I have with reading subtitles in a second language is that they tend to move a LOT faster than I can read. It can get frustrating for something as long as a movie because I am constantly having to pause and/or rewind. And if she just finished Duolingo, her language level is likely to still be on the low side."
languagelearning,3cl5b0,bickets,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:05:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that reading subtitles in the same language as the one you're hearing is much more productive. Transcribing is a useful exercise in my opinion as well. I usually use pre-recorded tv shows and films for that - you can switch off the subtitles, do some transcribing and then rewind and put them on to see how much you got right."

It might be too steep to go from endgame Duolingo straight into a fluent, rich English environment.   I'm trying to think of some middle-options..hmm.   If she's social: other Polish friends learning English?  How about an online skype-based buddy? (Maybe hard for Grandma?). How mobile is she? Can she join an English class for adults? Some communities even have free English night classes (if she's a new immigrant?) If not that, maybe a continued studies ESL class at a local college?   She could have her English assessed and be put straight into an appropriate class.  Does she have any grandkids yet? (Edit: child-aged grandkids/ great-grandkids)  Kids TV is GREAT for developing learners.  If she has the excuse of spending time with the grandkids she may not mind it.   Spending time with you (another family member/ friend) and teaching you her hobby?  It could balance out the power imbalance for new learners if she's the expert at say...making _____ delicious meal and you are the expert in your language.  (It helps adult listeners relax and develop speaking fluency more easily when they don't feel so...inferior. Also, the English speaker gets to learn a new skill, too!) ESL workbooks.  If she's a reader/writer (or just not super social), she'd probably really enjoy picking up an ESL textbook/workbook with practicing grammar/sentences. What does she want to use her English for?  That might help you and your spouse brainstorm more ideas :D   (Sweet of you to be so helpful and GO GRANDMA for picking up English so well so far!)"

Vygotsky stated that a child follows an adult's example and gradually develops the ability to do certain tasks without help.

languagelearning,3clukh,konungursvia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"These are the best resources I've found for learning Mandarin Chinese,  covering listening, production, writing, and reading:   The premade deck SpoonFedChinese. 25 cards a day. Chinesepod.com. One lesson per day, sometimes listening twice. This includes going along with the pdf, creating a new, Anki deck called separate from SpoonFedChinese called ""我的中文“ (or whatever), and inputting the new vocabulary in sentences. New Practical Chinese Reader 1-4. One lesson per day, including placing all the new vocabulary with example sentences in your 我的中文 Anki deck. Book 4 ends at Chapter 50 so you should be able to get to an intermediate Chinese reading level if you do one a day within about 2 months. Once you complete this series you move on to Advanced Reader of Contemporary Short Stories, which contains actually legit literature. After that, any novel/essay at all should be within your capability to comprehend. (Can't claim this is true yet because I'm not quite there, I'm almost done with NPCR book 3 though). Remembering Traditional (or Simplified) Hanzi by James Helsig. Learn 50 hanzi a day and you can complete this book in two months, effectively learning how to write 98% of the Hanzi you will ever encounter. Use this in conjunction with Skritter so you can learn real definitions (not just keywords) and pronunciation. (Helsig is ONLY good in that it orders the characters in the order most easy to memorize, with some mnemonics included.) Skritter. Costs $15 a month or something but if you want to write, use it. You can add a premade deck of all 3000 characters you are learning in Remember the Hanzi and practice them on the go, not to mention also practice their pronunciations and definitions which RTH doesn't have. You can also add a premade deck of the  vocabulary from New Practical Chinese Reader with Skritter. This helps me especially because I need context to remember which characters are used in which words. Pleco. It's an amazing dictionary on your phone.   These amounts are prescribed for people who want to spend 3-5 hours every day studying Chinese. I usually learn 100 hanzi a day, 50 flashcards from SpoonFedChinese, 50 flashcards from my homemade deck, listen to an episode of Chinesepod, and do two chapters in NCPR because I'm super obsessed with mastering this shit and finally being able to read some legitimate literature so I can move on to the next language (Literary Chinese). My secondary goal is learning Mandarin to a conversationally fluent level so I can enroll in a linguistics master's program in Taiwan.  These are the best resources I've gathered so far that will get me to my goals, but I will say one thing: if I was completely started from the beginning and were to choose just one book to pique my interest, it'd probably be Integrated Chinese. It seems like a really really great resource, it's just too easy / too late to start.  Request: write me one for Uyghur. I think it'd just go: welcome to the talrirnimfirmgij."

languagelearning,3cm2sd,donutboi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"1) You will not be learning Arabic that's suitable for communication with natives. You will be learning Modern Standard Arabic, which is a literary and news language used in only formal situations. It's somewhat different from colloquial Arabic, but, depending on your motivation and aptitude for language learning, the spoken language is not hard to learn at all. It will take extra effort though.  2) The grammar is difficult but extremely logical. There are tons and tons of rules and everything is conjugated/changes form (even prepositions) but it results in an almost infallible grammar system—thats for MSA, of course. Dialect does not have very consistent grammar lol.  3) The script is difficult at first, then it becomes second nature. Arabic is one of the most difficult languages in the world according to the US language ranking for native English speakers or whatever, but the script is a godsend if you were considering e.g.  Chinese/japanese which are ranked similarly in difficulty and have fucked up scripts that are very difficult.

languagelearning,3cli53,herbstzeit,3,Wed Jul 8 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"I have used tutors and I have worked as a tutor. Most of the issues that you find on sites like iTalki are the same sorts of issues that you will have with a tutor IRL. The reason being that people are pretty much the same all over the world.   The tutor you hire may not have a well prepared series of lessons for you. You need to find this out before hand. The tutor may just decide to stop showing up one day. So make sure you can pay as you go. As both the tutor and student I always insisted on payment at the end of my lesson (never in advance). Make sure you prepare for your lessons. Find out what you will be covering during the next lesson and be sure you study in advance so that you can focus on things that you find confusing or difficult in the actual lesson.   Where you meet is generally up to you. I always went to the person's home or place of work. I don't know what you mean exactly when you say you're ""not comfortable with it"" but most of the issues are really going to be pretty much the same. The ability to see your mouth/the tutor's mouth as you/he/she speaks is a very nice advantage of in-person lessons as is the ability to act things our or doodle on a page, but it's not clear to me why you would find one uncomfortable and not the other."
languagelearning,3cli53,Luguaedos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"By not comfortable with, I mean that a lot of the messages I'd get from people treated it more like OkCupid than a legitimate language exchange. I've never used Italki specifically, but sites recommended alongside it (which I should've specified). But this is all very valid, thank you for the in depth response! I've worked as a tutor before and I do recall the downside of not being paid upfront though: one time I got paid in a bag of chips. But I will start making lesson plans, maybe that'll help the process! Thank you"
languagelearning,3cli53,Luguaedos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"I understand now. But I can say that iTalki would not be like that if you are engaging a professional teacher or an informal tutor. iTalki has pretty strict standards of conduct for their teachers/tutors. When I signed up as an informal tutor, initially I was rejected because my profile picture was of me and my wife (I was giving her a kiss on the cheek). There are also topics that teachers agree not to discuss such as religion and politics. As far as the language exchange, I'm a male in my 40s and I have only been approached by other men for exchanges. Most of them have not really worked out. But I have made friends with 3 guys that are very reliable and we do one exchange each week. Combined with my informal tutoring lessons I get about 2 to 3 hours in my target languages each week and I spend less than $20.  Edit: You can also set your privacy settings on iTalki so that only people who are listed in your ""friends list"" can send you messages."

The vocabulary though for Syriac is much more expansive than that of the Bavli, though I suspect this is because the Bavli tends to be conservative with its diction in general.   For Syriac study, you should start with Thackson's ""Introduction to Syriac."" It's a not great, but it is the best that is currently available. There is a primer to Syriac by Kiraz, who heads Gorgias Press, but I still prefer Thackson. If you are serious about Syriac though, I suggest you take a course; I believe the Catholic University of America has a Syriac summer course, though I could be wrong.   The most difficult thing about Syriac will be the vocabulary [and it is not insurmountable] and also, to be honest, getting a good handle on the three different scripts. Other than that, you should be good to go. Behatzlachah."

Spanish: still getting used to some accents and dialects. i can understand the big 3 (spain, argentina, mexico) + chilean pretty well, but venezuelan and andalusian trip me up still for example. also not being able to find the right word for something specific sometimes. i need to speak more instead of focusing on listening  French: same as op. i could watch all of kaamelott or engrenages without problems one day, then i watch youtube skits and can't understand anything. i gave up on french for this. way too inconsistent.  German: everything. i recently finished perfezionamento tedesco so i hopped on over to a crime novel and wow i have a lot of vocab issues. as a result, my listening suffers as well.

Could probably quickly get back to a decent level and finally write my B1 if I put in enough effort and could find partners.  Mandarin: Plateaued because of grammar. Am around an HSK  2 level and hoping to write HSK 3 by October (I need it for college admissions) so I'm a bit worried. Listening skills are pretty bad though slowly improving. Speaking too. I don't have to 'force' tones anymore as much. Vocab building is getting much harder now, though 2 character compounds are easy if the constituent characters are. Reading short articles and some beginners short stories for practice now and then. If I were more disciplined I'd be able to do much more. Also, since I don't practice writing hanzi much, I'm finding I'm beginning to forget some. Thank god for SRS and review sites though.  Others: Lack of interest, time and low on priority.

This is by far my weakest area, and it's honestly because I haven't practiced enough targeted listening. I can understand conversation and hold a conversation well, but when it comes time to follow radio shows or TV, it gets to be a pain. Part of this is because almost everything TV wise is subtitled in English... so it's hard to get stuff that makes me listen to the Irish... Doubly so if it's a show I can't change tabs or cover up the screen on.   Every other language: Wanderlust/discipline. I'm interested in too many but don't really care about any of them as much as I do Irish, so I don't discipline myself into sticking with one. This combination makes it a huge pain in the ass to get started and actually make any progress in a language. I hope one day I'll find one that I'm as passionate about as Irish, or that I pay for, and can finally add a third language. But for now, it's just samplings."

languagelearning,3cf6z7,KyleG,2,Tue Jul 7 22:46:51 2015 UTC,I think its a mix of both. Sometimes forcing yourself to do the thing is what will bring the motivation back. I think it really just requires a knowledge of your limits. Know when you are pushing yourself through a slump and know when you are just needlessly punishing yourself.

languagelearning,3cf6z7,Lyzl,2,Tue Jul 7 22:52:57 2015 UTC,"I think we can divide motivation into two ideas.  1) the feeling of motivation is that emotional juice that comes in boxy little packages and helps you get the energy to do an hour or twos work. It's a little sprint of inspiration, fickle but helpful.  This op is against as the only method of learning a language. I agree.  2) deep motivation is the actual end goal and intrinsic reason for learning the language. It's knowing you want to go to Paris or Tokyo, talk to your Korean boyfriend, or surprise your Spanish mother-in-law. It's the love of a culture, literature, or collection of conversations and art.   I think we can always use a dose of the second kind to keep us on track. We need to affirm our belief that what we are doing is worthwhile and takes work. Sometimes, it won't be worth it, and it will be worth abandoning the pursuit.  Discipline can be used to get over those middle ground humps where we know the motivation (1) isn't quite there at the moment, but (2) is still alive and kicking. If after some weeks of discipline, (2) just isn't there anymore, than maybe it is time to move on and come back to the language at some other point, if at all."

languagelearning,3cic2l,KoHaiDotA,5,Wed Jul 8 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"The most useful languages (at least the top five) are likely: English, French, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic.   When it comes to measuring usefulness of languages, you have to consider overlap. For example, I was considering including Hindi, but I wouldn't need to learn Hindi as many Indians already speak fairly good English.   Furthermore, I wouldn't include Mandarin or Japanese because it has almost zero use outside of their respective home countries. You can get by on your other languages if needed.   I picked English naturally because it is effectively the most important language in the world right now and the United Kingdom has done a wonderful job of passing down English to their colonial subjects. Furthermore, I picked French because anywhere in Africa that they don't speak English, there's a fairly solid chance they speak French instead. Practically the same reason for my choice of Spanish, the whole of South America (minus Brazil) speaks Spanish in some form or another.   I then picked Russian and Arabic because they are well sized regional languages. In the case of Russian, many of the post-soviet breakaway countries are still under Russian influence or have a large Russian ethnic community within their borders. Arabic is similar because despite there being different dialects, it is a very important regional language.   If I was able to add two more languages, I would add Portuguese and then Mandarin. Portuguese because of Portugal, Brazil, and their other former colonial holdings. Mandarin because it would basically guarantee usefulness in China, which is a massive amount of people. So anyone who can't speak English would then be ""scooped up"" by learning Mandarin."

languagelearning,3cic2l,donadd,3,Wed Jul 8 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"English has ~700 million speakers and is firmly established as a world language and language of trade and commerce.   Spanish has ~350 million speakers, gives you access to half of the American supercontinent, which, it should be noted, is expected to grow significantly both economically and populationwise in the coming years. If you live in the US, especially the South, Spanish is probably going to be immediately useful to you.   French has something like 250 million speakers right now, but some projections show 750 million in the next half century or so, a large number of whom will be from Africa, which is also an economic powerhouse waiting in the wings... if they can pull their act together. Culturally, French gives you access to some really great works of literature and music.  Then I'd probably say something Eastern, like Russian, Hindi, or Mandarin, all of which are critical need languages for western governments, so mastering them can almost guarantee you a job. I favor Russian, myself; Russia is an old country and it's not just going to slip off the face of the earth. They're a nuclear power with a rich heritage, and they're still pulling themselves out from the collapse of the USSR. If they can reverse their population decline, they'll be a major world player again by the end of the century; they're rich in natural resources and there's a lot of technological development. China's economy is probably going to implode at some point, as much of their growth is an artificial bubble; I wouldn't count on Mandarin. Hindi is technically an Indo-European language, I believe, which should at least in theory make it a bit easier to learn than Russian and Mandarin, but still quite a challenge. A lot of India is impoverished and I expect it to stay that way for quite a while, so... maybe not Hindi.  I say English, Spanish, French, Russian. That should get you great coverage. It's the language spread I've chosen for myself as a long-term investment."

Did my graduate studies in a really complicated field that involved a boatload of modern Eastern European comparative work. I live in China so all the research languages necessary were kinda up to me (foreign language pedagogy is not the PRC's academic strong suit), and like the guy below, I found Albanian to be a blast. It's just so completely different from everything else out there. Been trying to keep up with it since, and luckily Beijing's Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press actually publishes a pretty decent 4-volume Albanian series. It's a traditional text-vocabulary-grammar grind, but it's surprisingly comprehensive.    For others who may be curious, Discovering Albanian is probably the current English-language go-to. It's recent, fairly up-to-date and readily available. The author, Linda Mëniku, did her thing as an instructor at Arizona State University's Critical Languages Institute. Other texts around include the old FSI/DLI series, which are extremely dense, even by the standards of these programs, but suffer by now beyond the unavoidable outdatedness of these courses in general. This is partly because with Albanian, even orthographical standards have changed so much since the time that some of these texts were written- things just aren't even spelled the same way now. Regardless, the language does need more love and exposure. Albanian is definitely a different kind of challenge, and definitely worth it."

What I get from the article is more that listening is a greatly underappreciated part of the language acquisition process.  That makes a lot more sense.    Before I got serious about learning Spanish, I watched a fair amount of Mexican football, and by doing so I noticed certain recurring words and patterns.  Words like sigue or entonces kept coming up, and though I didn't know what they meant, I could pick them out of a sentence, and that cuts down on the confusion of hearing a blur of rapid-fire syllables.    Edit: I suspect that listening would also help with pronunciation.  Many audio methods specifically advise against reading or note taking in the early stages, and I suspect this is why.  If you've heard ""Ich möchte..."" a hundred times, you probably know how it should sound, and you'll try to mimic the sound rather than try to pronounce it like an English word."

You have to actually separate the academic message of the study from the title on Reddit.   His main hypothesis is that simply listening to a new language sets up the structures in the brain required to learn the words.   We know that this is absolutely true from infants and even in unborn children. fMRIs have been done on new-born children, only days old, that have shown that their brains respond differently to the sounds of what will be their native language. The brain of a new-born child of English speaking parents will light up the language centers of the brain when it hears English but not when it hears Mandarin. The only explanation is that the language centers of the brain are developing in the womb and the child is able to hear at least its mother's voice and has tuned itself to the sounds of English.  What it means is that having the sounds of a foreign language around you unconsciously primes your brain to learn that language but you still have to learn it."

languagelearning,3cfbjj,ebonyshadows21,2,Wed Jul 8 11:58:17 2015 UTC,"I think the idea for a lot of young expats (even those who don't think teaching is really their calling) who teach abroad is that they go to learn the language and then either go into a field like NGO work or diplomacy or business or to network. It's really, really hard to make connections and to just pick up and move somewhere. You have to start somewhere, so I encourage you to at least look into teaching for a year or so. It'll get you a job, at least, while you figure out how to make your stay more permanent. You can't really just get up and move somewhere and start working. Most places aren't super happy with that.   I say this as an expat myself. And I'm not a teacher, but the majority of people in my age bracket who I meet here are (or they're tourists or they just do country runs every 30 days and kind of stay/work illegally on tourist visas).   Edit: many also go just to live abroad.  But no if you want to go to France, I know some people who got there being au pairs. I've also lived in France and feel it would be hard to be accepted there as an expat. They have a fierce sense of national identity."

I'm a French major at a university and I'm still around the beginning of my major requirements (3000 level courses) and this upcoming semester I'm taking two French classes. One will have eleven people and the other will have eight.   I decided to learn French because I think it's a beautiful language and I wanted to do something different from everyone else who was learning Spanish in school. I started in eighth grade, the first semester in my middle school where they began allowing foreign language classes. I did alright, I got a B and decided to continue with it in high school because I knew we had foreign language requirements. I had the absolute best teacher my freshman and sophomore year and she really motivated me to continue learning it. I got A's all through high school and through university thus far. I am fascinated by the culture and I am dying to go there next summer and look for an internship/teaching job. Le français est ma vie. ;)"
languagelearning,3cfbjj,davidabaileyjr,4,Tue Jul 7 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on who you ask.  In west and central Africa, French is used in education and business.  Even in countries like Algeria where it's not official, it's still reasonably common.    Among Anglophones, I'd say it's because we imagine Romance languages as the easiest to learn, and French has the best reputation among the major Romance languages.  And that's basically just our own ignorance; when we think of French or Italian, we think about art and music and architecture, but when we think of Spanish, we picture telenovelas and migrant workers."

Literature, sheet music and dinner menus can easily be translated but watching a film without a dub or subtitles is a much better experience. French language cinema is probably second only to English and even if the language declines in prominence, the enormous catalogue of great cinema will always be there.  I go to international meetups frequently and I constantly meet French speakers from all over the world. It's still a global language that will help immensely for travel and meeting new people.  French girls (European and Canadian) are really pretty and speaking French has treated me well so far ;)  It's also a useful language for international business but that's not as fun a reason and likely won't keep you motivated for as long a time as it will take to actually reach fluency"

Today it's still pretty cool in the Arab world, if you're into that sort of thing...

EU citizens are prioritised in most EU countries over non-EU immigrants, employment-wise (as in, to hire a non-EU applicant there has to be no other similarly qualified EU applicant, so if a company in France has to choose between a German and an American who have the same qualifications, they'll probably choose the German because there's no visa hassle to worry about), and we nominally have most of the same rights as a native. Moving between EU countries as an EU citizen is also piss-easy because we don't need visas, so if you're not an EU citizen you'd be better off asking an American (or other country) living in France how they did it. :)  Source: am Irish, have lived in various EU countries."

They speak at a normal pace, but they speak clearly and their vocab isn't too complex so it's understandable to French learners.  French by SBS Radio: They have 5-20 minute segments regarding a whole variety of topics, normally related to culture in a broad sense. They speak pretty fast, but they tend to speak clearly so it's not too difficult to understand. They release a new episode 5 days a week or so.

You will learn faster if you don’t let the fear of speaking not perfect Spanish constipate you from learning.”   When I was going for an exchange to Germany, I had some basic understanding of German and could roughly follow a conversation and say what I needed (food, drink, you know - the basics). It was late summer eve in my home town in Sweden where I was riding a late bus back home after a judo practice where some drunk came up to me and started talking to me about random stuff. I soon mentioned that I am going to Germany for exchange. The drunk plainly said ""Don't ever be afraid of speaking imperfectly, this will only hinder your language learning. Hell, chaces are even when you are fluent in German, they will know you're not German simply by accent and/or your wording"".  That really stuck to me and I really did apply that advice when I came to Germany for my exchange year. In the very end f that exchange year I was riding a cab to a party and was casually speaking to the cab driver, whom I made guess my origins. He said I speak perfect German with some minor errors, so I ought to be a second generation immigrant!   So don't be afraid to take good advice from a drunk, and don't be afraid of being wrong!"

Of course I want to understand people, but that hasn't materialized very well for French yet. So I'm working to improve that.  Edit: a word"
languagelearning,3ccps6,WillAlwaysLie,3,Mon Jul 6 22:56:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up. How do you manage learning two languages at once? Do you get them mixed up often?
languagelearning,3ccps6,WillAlwaysLie,2,Mon Jul 6 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I learned Portuguese a while ago. I have a little trouble understanding when people talk to each other, but if they slow it just a little bit with me, I can understand everything they say. I'm not actively improving my Portuguese currently. I learned it in about 2 months and then just kind of left it there and use it whenever I need (which is like once or twice a week, so I'm not fully neglecting it, but I don't work to improve it). French is the language I'm currently working on.  As for not mixing them up? No. Because each language modifies my voice, they each have words in a tone that I cannot say in the tone of the other language. The only words I sometimes get mixed up are ""ouais"" (yeah) in French while speaking Portuguese and ""ah, tá"" (oh, I understand/that's fine) in Portuguese while speaking French. This is because they're just so useful and roll off the tongue.  There's also the fact that I was born speaking Spanish, so speaking Portuguese is almost exactly like speaking Spanish, except you modify the words a little. As for French, it's not necessarily because it has the same grammar or words (but it does happen often), but it has the same ""rhythm"" that Spanish does, so I just use that while talking and my sentences come out better than if I were to try the ""rhythm"" English has.  The language I do get messed up in is Galician, because it's basically a mix between Portuguese and Spanish and I haven't studied it very well. So, in the end, I'm thinking a lot about which word I should be using, especially because Galician doesn't have a different tone. It's spoken with a Castillian(~) accent. I just speak it like I would normally speak Spanish (even though I have a South American accent and they have a Castillian accent)."

languagelearning,3cat7w,averagemonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:51:39 2015 UTC,"It also exists in English as ""advocate"" (corresponding to Danish forkæmper/fortaler).  The word comes from advocātus, the past participle of the Latin verb advocō. This verb consists of ad (= to, towards) and vocō (= ""I call"", related to vōx meaning ""voice""). Essentially, the verb means ""to summon"" or ""to call someone in"". Since the word advocate comes from the past participle of this, an advocate is essentially ""the summoned"".  Interestingly, we have the same verb in Danish: tilkalde (til = to, kalde = call), made up of the same parts as advocō. So ""advokat"" is just the Latin version of saying ""den tilkaldte""."

Unfortunately, resources for Armenian are not super prevalent on the Internet. There are Pimsleur tapes (available online) for Eastern Armenian and cover pretty basic stuff; they are good for pronunciation.  There are some good resources in the links section of the Omniglot page for Armenian with various lessons available.  I can suggest a few books as well, though they are generally somewhat expensive and hard to find.  The best way to learn is to find an Armenian speaker online who you can talk/learn with. There is a great website run by Rosetta Stone called Sharedtalk where you can chat with people in various languages. There are a few Armenian speakers on there. If you put Armenian as a target language you will likely be messaged by someone eventually, or you can search for someone."

languagelearning,3cempn,hcarlens,2,Tue Jul 7 08:55:49 2015 UTC,"I went to two out of ten evening classes   Classrooms aren't an ideal environment, but that's ridiculous.  Tools and techniques don't matter if you don't show up.  You're not going to make any progress until you decide that speaking French is more important than television, or avoiding embarrassment, or spending time with the family.  You have to decide that you will not allow yourself to slack off or quit."
languagelearning,3cempn,krnm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that attendance is necessary for making the most of lessons! However I don't think that this is specific to my experience - even in the second class I went to there were far fewer people than the first,  and I've heard from other people who've had similar experiences. I think this indicates that voluntary evening classes might not be a great environment to learn things like this - or at least not the type I attended."
languagelearning,3cempn,krnm,3,Tue Jul 7 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"However I don't think that this is specific to my experience   No, it's definitely not just you.  The dropout rate for language learning is huge, whether we're talking about classes or self-study.  Recently there was a Buzzfeed video where they asked four staffers to spend 20 minutes a day using the Duolingo mobile app.  They knew their progress would be reported and that they'd have dinner with native speakers at the end of the 60 days, but not one of them followed through.    I'm not a big fan of Ferriss or any purveyor of ""hacks.""  Still, if he inspires people to put their big kid pants on and do the work, that's still a win.  Learning a language well is a very long process, but in 6-12 weeks you can get to the point where you're having real conversations and getting stuff done in your new language, and that's huge.  Once you see that it can be done, and you're not defective, and it's totally worth the trouble, you'll be hooked."

She looked so dismayed and continues in Portuguish but then simply gives up and goes back to her boyfriend. The boyfriend tries to push her into trying to speak again, but me being the little idiot I am, continue to speak Portuguese. She simply gives up speaking English and her boyfriend comes and explains to me that in the whole trip, he's been trying to get her to speak English with people, but everyone's been speaking Spanish with her and that now that she was leaving, she simply gave up.  So that made me feel like an asshole after they left and realized what I did. So from then on, I've only spoken Portuguese with those who wanted me to speak Portuguese.

They quickly fell silent, asked me if I'd hand in this letter to someone and quickly ran out.

It is a lot harder than you think.  By way of example, my wife and I are both English/Japanese bilingual. I'm a native speaker of English and she is a native speaker of Japanese. Our bilingual child-rearing means that we speak to the children in our respective native languages, although I speak a good deal of Japanese at home as well to maintain as much of a Japanese environment as possible. The kids also watch Japanese tv and movie, read Japanese books, and do daily homework for Japanese school to keep their reading and writing and age-appropriate levels. It is beyond a full-time job. There is no waking moment at home when we are not doing something regarding the children's Japanese acquisition.  Puppets and gardening? Are these people quite mad?"

Well, I was born in Argentina, learned Spanish, then went to the US and learned English at almost 7 years old.  But it is my belief that it would not be a much more difficult than normal task to raise the children bilingual because just living in the US forces you to speak English, so you can just speak the other language at home. My mom never taught me English. I learned it ""by myself"". Unless you consider speaking the language a challenge. Then it's a different story. Can you please point out what I'm missing?"
languagelearning,3cbbf3,WillAlwaysLie,2,Mon Jul 6 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"so you can just speak the other language at home.   Reality does not bear this out. THe reason is...   Unless you consider speaking the language a challenge. Then it's a different story.    Yes, acquiring a language is a great challenge at any age.  It is very common in the US for household L2s to die out within a few generations. My family's experience was very typical in this regard. My great-grandparents immigrated to the US from Spain. My grandmother (an only child) was native in both Spanish and English. My mother (one of three) was native in both Spanish and English, but her two siblings only spoke English. In turn, my siblings and I are not native Spanish speakers.  The reason for this to happen is simple: people don't learn a language unless they have to.  If you live in a country, there is tremendous pressure to speak that country's language. Children who grow up in the US obviously have great pressure to learn English, but there is very little incentive to learn their family's heritage language even when both of their parents are native speakers. For example, imagine two parents who speak German and English raising a child in the US. If the child knows that his parents speak English, he has very little incentive to speak to them in German. The parents will have to be very diligent to reinforce German at home, and even then, it will be a challenge to develop vocabulary beyond household words. Maybe you know the Spanish words for ""cedar"" and ""nitrogen"" and ""strangle"" but a lot of people who just learn a language in the kitchen won't. We have to work hard to make sure our kids read and speak at the level of their peers who grow up in Japan."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,officerkondo,3,Tue Jul 7 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I actually don't know the Spanish words for all that. I know the ""kitchen"" Spanish that you're talking about. I don't know the names of vegetables and various other things. I don't believe it's the most important thing, honestly (though definitely teach it). If the child wants, they can learn it relatively quickly. The important thing is that the rest of the grammar structure is there and ingrained in their heads. If it wasn't for the fact that political Spanish words were so similar to English, I wouldn't know that either, but I'm sure if it were, let's say, Japanese, and I already know all the other words and grammar, I could easily learn political words. You can definitely teach them those words, but it can also be picked up relatively fast.   I'm sure it's important for them to know the Japanese writing system, so yes, that will be an effort that I can't provide insight into.  I can see how it is a challenge to force a child to force a child not to speak English, but it can be done. I'm not sure if I was an easy child or perhaps my circumstances were different, but my mom never allowed me to speak English with her and it worked for me. Just speak Japanese in the home and leave it like that, in my humble opinion. They have plenty of time to learn and use English outside the home.   EDIT: Sorry you're getting downvoted. I don't like it when people downvote others for stating their opinion. Or do you have a bot after you?"
languagelearning,3cbbf3,WillAlwaysLie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's the most important thing, honestly    Don't you think? These are just a few examples of many words that native speakers of a language know.   If the child wants, they can learn it relatively quickly.   Assuming this is true, ""if the child wants"" is the key. If everyone in the household speaks the country's language, it is unlikely that the child will want to learn the heritage language. This is why we see heritage language dying out within families within a few generation of immigration.   I can see how it is a challenge to force a child to force a child not to speak English, but it can be done.    Please understand the difference between ""possible"" and ""probable"".   Just speak Japanese in the home and leave it like that, in my humble opinion. They have plenty of time to learn and use English outside the home.    With respect, you are not very well equipped to give child-rearing tips. Like I said, we are doing well but it is not nearly as simple as, ""just speak the language at home""."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,officerkondo,3,Tue Jul 7 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"Outside of the home, ""kitchen"" skills will get you through pretty much everything. I haven't had an instance where I simply couldn't speak with other Spanish speakers about a topic because I learned everything I needed to from my home. Of course, like I said, this may be because of the cognates that English and Spanish share.  I said ""if the child wants"", but what I should have said is, ""if the child wants when they grow up"". I don't believe a child needs more than the simple aspects of the language at least until they reach their teen years, but that's just me.  When I said ""it can be done"", I meant that it's as simple as speaking the language at home. But you don't believe it's that simple. Do you believe it's because Spanish is much more similar to English than Japanese or because your children and I are different? Or is it perhaps another reason?"
languagelearning,3cbbf3,WillAlwaysLie,0,Tue Jul 7 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"Outside of the home, ""kitchen"" skills will get you through pretty much everything.   Have you ever had a job interview for an office job in Spanish, for example? How about a business client? There is a difference between ""shooting the shit"" at the bar and the level of competence that adult native speakers have.   I don't believe a child needs more than the simple aspects of the language at least until they reach their teen years, but that's just me.   The research does not support this belief of yours.   When I said ""it can be done"", I meant that it's as simple as speaking the language at home. But you don't believe it's that simple.    I don't believe. I know. All you are doing is arguing based on how you think things should be. I am discussing how things are.   Do you believe it's because Spanish is much more similar to English than Japanese   It has nothing to do with the relation between Spanish and English. It has to do with the observed fact that in general, immigrant families tend to lose their heritage language after a few generations."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,officerkondo,2,Tue Jul 7 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't had an interview in Spanish, but because of my mom, I only learned polite Spanish. I am only recently learning the ""shoot the shit"" Spanish that everyone else speaks. I'm fairly sure if I went to a job interview in Spanish, I'd do just as fine as I would in a job interview in English, since my command of Spanish is almost as good as my English, save for a few words that can be learned. If I needed to partake in an interview in Spanish, I would just study to see what I should do right now, in the same way I would if I had an interview in English tomorrow.  I should have worded this better, but simple aspects is basically everything but specialized subjects. But anyways, this is deviating. To force the child to speak the other language at home through the early years makes it weird for them to speak to you in English later on, which is good.  I'm arguing based on how things are with me. Have you raised a non-bilingual child? If you have, you'll still have that beyond full time job. You'll still have to listen and watch stuff in English. You'll still have to help out with their English homework. You'll still have to read in English. It's definitely a bit more difficult, but not a tremendous amount more than just raising a child. People in Europe, Asia, and Africa do it all the time without it being a big deal.   That's when people don't speak their language at home. People oftentimes choose not to do so because they don't consider their language as important anymore, not necessarily because it's more difficult to do so."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,WillAlwaysLie,2,Tue Jul 7 02:12:41 2015 UTC,"People oftentimes choose not to do so because they don't consider their language as important anymore, not necessarily because it's more difficult to do so.   This is where you are fumbling. Learning and maintaining a language is a lot of effort. If it isn't important to keep the languages, most people won't. The challenge parents face is making it important. Again, this is why immigrant families tend to lose their heritage language after a few generations."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,officerkondo,3,Wed Jul 8 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"That's actually the point I cared least about.  The challenge before was that it was not an important language to learn, right? Families don't need it, therefore they lose it. But we're not people that only care about English so that doesn't apply to us. Maybe to our grandchildren it will apply, but that's too far down the line to think about at this moment (hell, even children for me).  You actually made me call my mom to confirm this about me. She told me she did not put any special effort into improving my Spanish skills. So I turned out a native bilingual speaker (if one can consider English a native language of mine) with no special effort on her part. She spoke to me in Spanish in the home and outside the home I spoke English. So I repeat the question, what makes my situation different from your children, that it's a much more difficult task to raise them bilingual instead of monolingual? Is it because Spanish is closer to English than Japanese is to English? Is it because your children and I are different? Or is it another reason entirely?   If you want, you can keep in mind that I was born in Argentina and lived there for the first 6 (almost 7) years of my childhood with no English, as a way to differentiate the circumstances between me and your children."

That's pretty much what any second-generation immigrant does; Mom and Dad help as much as they can, but by the time the kid becomes a teenager, she speaks English far better than her parents.    Though really, anything about language acquisition is considered ""crazy"" by somebody.  It's still pretty widely believed that you can't learn a language beyond a certain age, or that you can't do so without moving to a country where it's spoken, or that certain nationalities are genetically predisposed against learning other languages."
languagelearning,3cbbf3,krnm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:30:24 2015 UTC,This will largely depend on the age of the child and the length of time you'll be raising them. I can't imagine that bilingual and monolingual children have significant weight differences -- until they reach eight or nine an able-bodied adult shouldn't have much of a problem for short periods.

If we're talking about English, the following should help.  I am swimming.   It's a participle used to form the present continuous tense.    Swimming is a difficult sport   It's a noun. Therefore it's a gerund.   One quick test is to substitute ""The act of Xing"" to see if it still makes sense:  I am the act of swimming. - clearly means something very different than the original sentence.  The act of swimming is a difficult sport. - doesn't quite mean the same as the original sentence, but you can see that it's similar in meaning.  Not a perfect test, obviously. You can also try substituting ""to X"" for the form:  Swimming is difficult > To swim is difficult - practically the same, because the infinitive structure is nominal just like a gerund is."

languagelearning,3c7akc,ishgever,11,Sun Jul 5 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"As you mentioned, it's important to find people of roughly the same level as you. It also comes down to laziness or selfishness - I avoid the first in myself and the latter in others. I've been pretty lucky so far in my partners but, as they say, you make your own luck - I seek people with whom I have things in common and can talk, people I can go and do things with, and avoid people who are clearly trying to just use me as a free English teacher. I find people who have an actual active interest in learning the language rather than needing to do it for a test or for work, the necessity of which always skews the balance to their side (and then they never arrange to meet up with you after their exams are over).   If you get along with the person regardless then I find it kind of sorts itself out. Even if you're talking in one language for a while you tend to take frequent detours to explain idioms or linguistic quirks and then the mutual curiosity for languages lets you flip back and forth as the conversation fits. So I guess in short my list of tips is:   Never go with absolute beginners. It's language exchange and that requires a certain amount of fluency; you're not a teacher. Find people you'd probably be friends with normally outside of the language barrier. Otherwise it's just work. Don't bother with 50:50, ""you do an hour, I'll do an hour"" plans. Just start talking about actual topics and then remember to give or take as the ratio skews too far to one side. You both know you're there for a language exchange - there's no issue with pausing in the middle of a sentence and saying ""Actually I have no idea how to say that in [language], what's the word for [this]?"" and then going on from there."

languagelearning,3c7akc,guoshe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"If it works for you, go for it. I was providing advice based on my experience and beliefs. I've never found 50:50 to work well for me and it leaves the whole thing too rigid and inflexible, too much like work. You also need to be very good at time management - you need to say ""We will only meet for 60 minutes or 90 minutes or 120 minutes"" and then split it right down the middle (or set fixed times of X minutes and then alternate and keep track), and since nothing is perfect you're still looking at an imbalanced ratio. Also you'll be switching between languages anyway to shore up gaps in understanding (e.g. to explain certain things or make equivalents) so why not just leave yourself more free to go with that? If it's not working then try something else, but I've found that keeping things low-key and familiar helps encourage actual friendship and a desire to meet up again, and the conversation benefits massively from this mutual comfort and mimics more appropriately the natural conversation you'd expect to have in the language you're looking to learn - idioms, quirks of informal grammar, vocabulary, etc."
languagelearning,3c7akc,reagansdeathsquads,5,Mon Jul 6 10:24:28 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that I absolutely disagree with 1 and 3, and maybe even 2.  As for 1., an absolute beginner in English is the perfect language exchange partner, as they won't be constantly slipping into English. They won't be able to teach you nuances of grammar, but that's not the purpose of a language exchange - they aren't a grammar teacher, they are a partner for conversation practice. You'll have a dictionary with you should they use a word you don't understand. There are plenty of other places for you to get information about the nuances of grammar. As long as you know how to ask 'is this sentence natural?' in your target language, you'll be able to get the information from them that you need.  If you don't follow the 50:50 rule, someone is getting shafted. Moving from one language to another every few sentences won't give you a sense of how a conversation flows in your target langauge, and invariably means that your partner is concentrating more on what they are about to say than on listening to what you are saying. I think the 50:50 rule is absolutely indispensible.  As for rule 2, the best language exchanges I had were with people who I liked, but wasn't necessarily friends with. Things were kept on a very bussinesslike level. That worked out very well for me, though obviously other people's experiences might be different."

I gave advice based on my experience and following those rules has done me pretty well; ignoring them has left me with awkward and unproductive sessions where I treat the exchange as work or study (i.e. something to be delayed or avoided) rather than an opportunity to improve my Italian while hanging out with someone I like.

But we're talking about language EXCHANGES, not language TUTORING. If I'm just getting someone to teach me a language from scratch (or vice versa) I find that casual conversation is not the way to start with that. You want an actual teacher until you're competent enough to start conversing creatively (i.e. constructing new phrases and ideas from what you've already learned, rather than just repeating phrases like ""Hello"", ""How are you"", ""I am 30 years old"", etc).  Anyway, the whole point is to remove all barriers to productive conversation. This means, on top of the stuff I've already mentioned, that you shouldn't try to exploit them because it's selfish and it will reduce their desire to meet up with you again. You should still aim to do half each but not in any rigid 50:50 timed format, you know? Just do it organically, as the conversation flows. Also there's another benefit to finding someone of a higher (i.e. closer to your own) level, which is that they will be able to point out common mistakes when moving between those two languages, some of which you only discover or notice when you've studied it in the opposite direction. I.e. warning against false friends that if you hadn't studied their language you wouldn't know why they use that quirky word occasionally, or how to explain what it actually means or what they actually want to say."
languagelearning,3c7akc,reagansdeathsquads,6,Tue Jul 7 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to have something you want to talk about and think about what you want to say in advance. Nothing is worse than one meeting after another where you ask ""how are you, how's the weather"" etc. But it's also bad to launch into a discussion about (e.g.) the New Horizons probe to Pluto, only to realize you have no idea how to say things like ""launched"" ""approach"" ""orbit"" etc.  Pick a topic and prepare."
languagelearning,3c7akc,GregHullender,2,Sun Jul 5 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"You'll probably get the most out of a language exchange when you are at a high beginner or low intermediate level. Once you are at that point, the most important thing is to be very strict about dividing time - for X minutes you speak only English, and then for X minutes you speak only in the target language. (Even explanations should be done in the language in question, though of course, you'll have your dictionary with you should you need to use it.) If someone can't stick to that rule, dump them and find someone else. Expect to take some time to find someone who really can stick to that rule - many peole can't. Don't waste your time on someone who is wasting yours."

languagelearning,3c7akc,govigov03,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:50:31 2015 UTC,The best use is... not having them.  Just make friends that are natives and talk to them in it. No problems arise.
languagelearning,3c7akc,Veqq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:32:46 2015 UTC,i always suggest speaking in the language you want to learn (the other's native language). so the conversation takes place in two languages. it's odd at first but you soon get over that and ensure you offer corrections as you go.

languagelearning,3c7h7j,matty_cams,3,Sun Jul 5 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"The way I got through this with a few of my languages is just to keep listening to a lot of material at different speeds. The slower-paced stuff is great for putting everything together and copying speech patterns and mannerisms. At a faster rate of speech, you might not be able to catch everything, but you'll get used to just hearing the language at that speed, picking up on stress, intonation, speed.  Just listen to as much as you can, but make it a good mix of things you can understand completely, and something a little more challenging."
languagelearning,3c7h7j,farcissist,2,Sun Jul 5 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a matter of time and exposure. Hearing speech at a native pace can be overwhelming - even more so when you're just starting out. It's one of those things that will improve over time as long as you're consistent in practicing.   I find I end up understanding more if I'm more relaxed while listening. If you're listening to something, don't worry about 100% comprehension (at least the first time through) as it'll make you stressed out about your language learning process and deter you moving forward. Just do your best to passively understand and look for patterns of word usage/speech. If you find a certain phrase is repeated often, look it up and it'll give you an a-ha! moment the next time you hear it.  When it comes to conversing with someone I find it's, again, just a matter of enough practice. You're learning the language, it's okay to make plenty of mistakes from rapid speech! The more comfortable you are in realising that, the more comfortable you'll be with rapid speech."

languagelearning,3c7jvi,MillieSpeed,3,Sun Jul 5 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"Tips as an expat that have helped me learn German:   Enroll in a language school that meets at least once a week. Go every week. No excuses - unless you're sick enough to miss work, you should be going to language school. TV can only be in German. Same with any leisure reading/ audio books etc. Join only German speaking hobbies/sports/leisure activities. Develop a German speaking circle of friends. Find a tandem. Join conversation groups. Try out your German any chance you get.   This is hard, but try to get into a firm routine and stick with it. You need to make it an inescapable part of your life - you don't decide whether you go to German class on Thursday evening - it needs to be just a non-questionable part of the changes that came into your life as a result of the move to Germany."

languagelearning,3c6ds7,zarzuu,17,Sun Jul 5 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm from Sweden and have studied German a bit. Although I was really bad at it and thought it was really hard it's true that knowing Swedish helped a bit. The sentences are built in roughly the same way and from my experience you can pretty much guess what some words mean when you hear them.   My mother on the other hand can speak German pretty well and says that it's really easy to pick up because it's so similar to Swedish.   That said, as a swede you can't really understand German (other than some words here and there) if you haven't studied it. And I think the same is true the other way around.   I guess my point is that I don't believe Swedish is too similar to German but it might help knowing one of the languages when starting to learn the other."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,Panduxify,5,Sun Jul 5 08:09:14 2015 UTC,"Well I'm no expert on the subject of learning two similar languages at the same time but I've studied both Swedish and German and in my experience they are very similar. Lots of the same words and expressions. (In some way Swedish is simpler since it doesn't have the noun cases.) I learned Swedish in school to a ""can read a newspaper but can't really have a deep conversation"" level. Now I'm living in Germany and German's pretty much overwritten Swedish for me. I can understand Swedish but when I try to speak it German comes out."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,murokeksi,4,Sun Jul 5 08:15:01 2015 UTC,"I'm currently learning Swedish and can speak German fairly fluently. Both being Germanic, they are quite similar, though I feel as though Swedish is closer to English. The similarities between German and Swedish are some cognates and some sentence structure.  In terms of how German helps with Swedish, understanding German really helps with cases. If you understand how to use die, der, und das quite well, they well give you a base of most other gender based languages (Icelandic I understand has four, so that will be an exception). Modern Swedish only has two, and so conjugation would be no problem.  I would think that learning German and Swedish is a great mix, considering how similar the grammar is, yet how different the vocab is. The hardest thing about Swedish is the pronunciation, so make sure you watch The Bridge on Netflix and watching videos like this one and in no time you'll be an expert in Swedish :)"
languagelearning,3c6ds7,codsterman,2,Sun Jul 5 09:31:36 2015 UTC,"I say go for it. I studied Swedish my final year in college after 3 years of German. I found that the background in German along with English as my native language made it very easy to pick up Swedish. By the end of that year of study I could read the newspaper with good comprehension. I delved into some contemporary poetry. I could follow pop songs remarkably well. And this was back in the day before the internet and all those wonderful youtube videos and access to Swedish websites.  Some centuries back there was a migration of merchants from what is now Germany into what is now Sweden and they took their Low German dialects.  The result is that I found a number of parallels in word structure that made it easy to learn vocabulary or to reason out unknown words, especially verbs. There is a fairly strong correlation of verb roots and affixes between the two languages. And the grammar is a bit more English-like as others have said.  Once you get the basics in Swedish you'll see where things match up with the German you know and where they match up with English. Plus I found the melody and rhythm of speaking Swedish just darn fun.  My only regret was I had no chance to keep it up when I moved on to grad school."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,N45HV1LL3,2,Sun Jul 5 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"I speak German and very little Swedish. I do, however, speak Spanish as well.  They're different. There's no case system in Swedish and conjugation is lightyears easier (probably one of the easiest languages in the world to conjugate). Sure, you'll be able to recognize vater och son, but you can do that with English too. It'd be fun to learn Swedish sometime, but for some odd reason, Finnish is higher on my priority list (as is Chinese).  The German background will help give you an advantage on some words, but nowhere near as many as Dutch.  In any case, Spanish is five hundred times more useful. Why? Because there's 100 millionen mehr (had to) Menschen die können Spanisch verstehen.   (I don't get many opportunities to mix German and English, so forgive me: Spanish is a UN language with 100 times more speakers. It's more useful as a diplomat or as an economist, especially considering most Swedes can speak English.)  Anyway, the most important criteria is how much you want to learn the language. Like I said, I want to learn Finnish even though it's pretty useless to know. It just sounds beautiful. Go with your gut."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,LazyDriver,3,Sun Jul 5 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I added Spanish to German and agree with this. The only time I mixed them up as at the beginning when I'd answer in German when I didn't know the words in Spanish yet because it was kinda my instinct that 'oh, it's not English......use German', but I kicked that habit pretty fast.  Spanish is definitely much more useful than Swedish, but if you WANT to learn Swedish more and have for several years, go for it, especially for free!   Edit: If anything, it is probably easier to source Spanish lessons outside of a University than it is Swedish. You can always learn Spanish later on if you want. If you really want to learn Swedish and this is your 'big opportunity' to do it, jump on it. Good luck!"
languagelearning,3c6ds7,sezionmakeup,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a German learning Swedish and I'd say that knowing German helps. The sentences are build roughly the same way and some words are nearly identical. But English also helps a lot in terms of vocabulary, for example ägg --> egg. Just try it out, I love Swedish and learning it for free is a great chance!"
languagelearning,3c6ds7,Jolaechen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"I really don't think they're too similar...at least I doubt you'll get them mixed up. As an intermediate(ish) German speaker/reader, I can only make out a tiny bit of the Swedish I've seen. Compare that to Dutch, where I can skim an article and get the gist of it (normally). Actually, if you have a good knowledge of basic German grammar, I would think that would help you a lot!"
languagelearning,3c6ds7,polyclod,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:01:54 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on Swedish because I've never studied it, but I added Spanish to German in almost the same situation....had a couple of electives to use up, only difference is I don't have a scholarship but it's only chance I'd get to take classes without paying upfront for them.  Anyway, I don't think it was as bad as people as it is, but this is with Spanish and German being so different. I did have to kick the the habit of using the German word when speaking and didn't know the Spanish word, just because my brain had the 'instinct' of using German when speaking a language not English, but I got over it after a few weeks."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,sezionmakeup,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"If Swedish is the language you're most interested in, I'd say go for it. There are a lot of cognates, which should really give you a good boost. I studied Swedish, Norwegian and German at the same time, and in my mind, the Swedish words 'sounded' Swedish, and likewise with the German vocab, so I never really got the two confused. They just sound different enough that I'd never get my wires crossed.  On a side note, I'd thoroughly discourage learning Swedish and Norwegian at the same time. That was a nightmare lol."
languagelearning,3c6ds7,matty_cams,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think it totally depends on you in the end. I study German and I decided to do a short course in Swedish for kicks and the best way that I can describe how it was for me is that the pronunciation, style and formatting of the language is just too different for me to mix up very easily.   It also really depends, I think, on the experience you have in a given language. If you're starting out learning two new languages that sound vaguely similar you might have issues then since your brain hasn't had time to compartmentalize the two different languages and it hasn't developed a keen sense of which language is being spoken when. That can definitely cause some confusion in my personal opinion."

What about OTC drugs for headaches, diarrhea, and the like? - Do you want to unwittingly die in your sleep as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning because you don't understand how your stove works? - What happens when you need to get your computer fixed?

The goal is to pick something that's hard enough that you'll still be learning something new, but easy enough that most of what you're reading is known to you. If you know less than 90% of the words, it's going to feel more like an exercise in dictionary lookup than it will like reading, and it's going to take you a long time to finish even your first page.   If you haven't reviewed in a while... while not check out some graded readers? You can also go to lingq, they have a paid thing with fancy tools, but just click the 'beginner' or 'intermediate' section, and pick something to start reading. It's all got audio there too if you'd like to work on your listening as well. Most book stores though should have at least one graded reader in their spanish section... maybe go hang out and read for a few hours to get rolling.   It might be a good idea to read a book on your kindle/computer/whatever instead of a paper book for your first one too, since it makes look up much faster and easier. If it takes you 5 seconds instead of 15 seconds every time you need to look something up, that'll add up real quick and give you a sense of flow way earlier."

Wir sind zur Stadt gegangen, und du hast es mich gelassen, alles auf dem Weg zu schnüffeln. Das ließt du mich nie tun. Wir sind an ein Gebäude herangekommen, die weiße riechende Stelle wo wir schon gewesen waren. Mit allen den kranken Tieren. Du bist angefangen, sehr werkwürdig auszusehen, und es hat mich nervös gemacht. Wir haben da eine Weile lang gesessen und sind in den anderen Raum gekommen. Du hast mich auf den Tisch gehoben. Du hast mich nie auf den Tisch gelassen. Die große unheimliche Frau war da, ihr habt gesprochen. Sie hat mich mit etwas gestochen, und du hast dein Gesicht gegen mich gedrückt und hast geweint. Ich wollte dir erzählen, es tat fast nicht weh. Es tat überhaupt nicht sehr weh. Ich bin angefangen schläfrig zu werden und habe mich gelegt. Es war der beste Tag je.   This took longer than expected..  I'll do one in my native language, Danish, as well:   Jeg vågnede op om morgenen og havde ondt. Du gav mig den væmmelige pille og det gik væk igen. Du hældte min mad op i min meget specielle skål. Det virkede som en af de dage hvor du ikke ville tage afsted. Men du virkede lidt underlig. Du tog min bedste tennisbold, og vi gik udenfor. Det gjorde vi aldrig mere, fordi jeg så tit havde ondt. Vi gik i parken og legede apport i rigtig lang tid, det var fantastisk. Men du virkede lidt underlig. Vi gik ind mod byen og du lod mig lugte til alt på vejen. Det lod du mig aldrig gøre. Vi kom hen til en bygning, det hvide lugtende sted, hvor vi havde været før. Med alle de syge dyr. Du begyndte at se helt mærkelig ud, og det gjorde mig nervøs. Vi sad der et stykke tid og kom så ind i det andet rum. Du løftede mig op på bordet. Du lod mig aldrig komme op på bordet. Den store uhyggelige kvinde var der, I snakkede. Hun stak mig med noget, og du trykkede dit ansigt mod mig og begyndte at græde. Jeg ville gerne sige til dig, at det ikke gjorde særlig ondt. Det gjorde overhovedet ikke særlig ondt. Jeg begyndte at blive søvnig og lagde mig ned. Det var den bedste dag nogensinde.   Well, that was much quicker!"

Me parecía uno de esos días en los que no te quieres ir. Pero parecías medio extraño. Fuimos afuera con mi balón de tenis favorito. Ya no lo solíamos hacer, porque me dolía casi siempre. Caminamos al parque y jugamos fetch por un tiempo muy largo. Fue asombroso! Pero aún, parecías extraño. Caminamos al pueblo, y me dejaste oler todo en el camino. Nunca me lo permitías. Llegamos a un edificio, el lugar blanco y maloliente a que ya habíamos ido antes, con todos los animales enfermos. Empezaste a parecer aún más extraño y por eso también yo tenía miedo. Nos quedamos allí por un tiempo y entonces fuimos a otro cuarto. Me subiste a la mesa. Nunca lo hacías. La mujer grande que me daba mucho miedo estaba ahí, y con ella hablaste. Me pinchó con algo, y te acercaste y pusiste tu cara junta con la mía; empezaste a gemir. Quería decirte que no me dolía mucho. No me dolía para nada. Empecé a sentirme muy cansado, y me eché.

Det brukade vi aldrig göra, eftersom jag så ofta hade ont. Vi gick till parken och apporterade i en jättelång tid, det var sjukt kul. Men du verkade lite udda. Vi gick till stan och du lät mig lukta allting på vägen. Du lät mig aldrig göra det. Vi kom fram till en byggnad, den vita stinkande platsen vi hade besökt förut. Med alla de konstiga sjuka djuren. Du började verka väldigt udda och det gjorde mig nervös. Vi satte oss där en stund och gick in i det andra rummet. Du lyfte mig upp på bordet. Du brukade aldrig låta mig vara på bordet. Den stora läskiga damen var där, ni pratade. Hon stack mig med något, och du tryckte ansiktet mot mig och började gnälla. Jag ville berätta för dig att det inte smärtade så mycket. Det smärtade inte alls. Jag började bli sömnig, och la ner. Det var den bästa dagen någonsin.   Was harder than I expected it to be.

Use me dolia, doler = to feel pain, lastimar = some specific event that hurt you, like I hurt my arm, or my brother hurt me.   Me diste de comer al píldora    I'm assuming you meant la, not al?   Me parecí que un dia cuando no quieres salir    me pareci = I seemed to myself. Don't use the preterite either, it's something that was continually happening. therefore, it's: me parecia un dia (en el que) no quieres (irte). The stuff in parentheses is better, though I can't explain why.   al fuera    afuera   (Ya) no lo hacíamos nada alguno mas    nothing some more? Just take that out. We didn't do it anymore. done.   jugamos para una larga vez    length of time = por, not para. Also, vez and tiempo both mean 'time' in English, but have different meanings in Spanish. Honestly, I'm not sure how to explain it. However, 'un tiempo largo' is what is needed here.   la mala lugar que hemos sido en el pasado   El mal lugar a que ya habiamos ido (en el pasado)  Basically, lugar is masculine, and you want to say 'the place we HAD been to', so you need the past, and also, hemos sido means 'we've been' in the sense of being, not going. Ser vs ir.   La grande, mal mujer estuvo allí   La mujer mala y grande estaba alli  Avoid putting adjectives first, and avoid estuve, estuvo, etc.   Nos asentamos allí y fuimos al otro cuarto   Nos sentamos alli y fuimos a otro cuarto   Ella me puso   Pincho, o pico, she didn't put you with something, she poked you.   tocaste su cara a mi cara   This is a hard one. I would use poner though. Pusiste tu cara junta con la mia, or something like that. Your sentence just seems a little off.   (estaba) cansado y me acueste.   me acoste. (accent on the e, I can't do them though.) Also, avoid estuve.  Even though you didn't use google translate, you still came up with an entirely understandable short story translation, and that's no small feat. You should definitely be proud! The vocab will get there with time, just try to think outside the box, and remember to differentiate between preterite/imperfect!"
languagelearning,3c52vc,astromule,3,Sat Jul 4 21:33:03 2015 UTC,I have not used it before but this is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping I might find! Unfortunately the Spanish page has a '?' instead of accented characters so it's almost impossible to use it for Spanish.
languagelearning,3c52vc,PrincessCenedra,5,Sun Jul 5 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience, that seems like overkill... better to read graded material to start with to bridge that gap. The goal after all is to know a good amount of the words/grammar used... having an english translation to help you through it won't change the fact that you're reading something too hard if you only know half the words in each sentence, and half the conjugations used.   For me personally, the easiest road seems to be using graded content for a while and then jumping into young adult fiction once you're up through all the basic grammar and you know 90% of the words on the first page. Maybe 80% if you're really patient.   No amount of hand holding will help you get that first giant wall of vocabulary down faster... always best to seek out the right things to read instead at first, in my opinion at least. Unless you're learning a rare language without much material available of course, then you do what you have to do.   I do agree though that reading is a great way to learn chunks of a language... won't get you nearly as far as speaking will, but it's just about the fastest way I know to learn a bunch of new vocabulary without having to expend any effort on anything that feels like studying. I also agree that extensive reading and covering as much ground as you can will get you further in the same amount of time than carefully reviewing the same passage multiple times, but we all have our own styles."

languagelearning,3c6gmm,PeteDarwin,2,Sun Jul 5 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"I would agree that French is more useful internationally but from a literary point of view Italy is GREAT,  not to mention that it has one of the richest and oldest culture in the world (culturally richer than France IMO).  Studying languages I found it very hard to study a language which culture I wasn't particularly interested in, you will eventually lose the motivation to study it. Personal interest is a key factor in studying so maybe do a bit of more research on their culture and your interests?  They are kind of similar though so as someone suggested you could try to play with duolingo for a couple of days and see which one you like more."

languagelearning,3c6gmm,Luguaedos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"The first foreign language that I gained any degree of proficiency in was Brazilian Portuguese. I lived in Brazil for quite a while (age 21 to 29 or something like that). I picked up Spanish pretty damn easily talking with friends of mine from Mexico at my local YMCA (also two years in high school more than 20 years ago). I started learning Italian this year on the 4th of January and, while my ability to speak is not perfect, I understand most of what I hear. I can watch cartoons in Italian and understand about 100%. I listen to News in Slow Italian on my commutes to work and I might not understand a word here or there my comprehension is close to 100%. I recently I met a guy on iTalki who wanted to speak English with me and he just happened to be from the Basque country so I figured, I've always wanted to learn Basque, we could do an exchange. I found Assimil's Basque course (in French) and thought, hey, I'll give this a try and to my surprise I have no real difficulty reading the French in that book. I have never studied French at all.  You cannot possibly make a wrong choice here. If you learn French, you have access to all the Assimil courses but a large number have been translated to Italian. If you have a chance to go to Italy for a while, you should study the language. The amount of resources available for learning Italian is so amazingly abundant at all levels up to and including C1 that I have issues sticking to a single resource for long. There are multiple series of books just for listening comprehension for basic, intermediate, and advanced. There are books just to help intermediate learners with their writing. There are books that exist with just topics and followup questions for conversations. And on top of that Italians are insanely passionate about helping others learn Italian. I literally have to turn people down for languages exchanges at least once per week."

Italy is the most beautiful looking place to me, but like I said, French is more useful. I guess if I learn Italian and then Portuguese French would come incredibly easily. I was really hoping to use my ability to learn languages to teach english around the world. I figure I might be overthinking it because as I understand it, it takes about half the time to learn romance languages as it does Russian, and a quarter of the time for Chinese, so I really should delve in. It will probably be Italian and then from there other Romance languages will probably be easier."

Of course like anywhere, learning the basic pleasantries will be appreciated by locals, but really, if your only reason for considering Swedish is to do that program and your classes are in English, pick one of the others because almost everyone you will deal with in Sweden will be able to speak to you in English.

Taking a graded language course is very time consuming, so you might as well study something that will benefit you in the long run. I'd recommend Spanish or French, as there are many Spanish and French speakers around the world that don't speak English very well.

If you're interesting in an indigenous language or in north american languages as a whole, I would definitely suggest these apps.    Another note: they're big.

languagelearning,3c4lx8,sailorcybertron,2,Sat Jul 4 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ok first is Hiragana. It is the main syllibary used with Japanese words. If it isnt written in Kanji (coming soon) and its Japanese, its in Hiragana. Verb inflections, particles, conjunctions etc. There are about 46 of them, and theyre just a bunch of syllables. A i u e o, ka ki ku ke ko, sa s(h)i su se so etc.  After that you do Katakana. For the most part, its sounds are identical to Hiragana. It is used in loan words and things like onamatapoeia (butchered that word), so not aaaaas important, but after Hiragana it is quite easy.  Then the best one Kanji. Theyre practically Chinese characters. There are about 2100ish you need to know to be considered proficient (by government standards). They all have multiple pronounciations depending on the word, but its not that bad. Youll learn them throughout the entire language learning process. Theyre used in anything the other 2 arent, so nouns, adjectives, verb stems, adverbs... Almost anything really.  Best way? Is there a best? Sounds subjective. I personally use things like Memrise and Anki. Try different methods and see what works for you.  Thats just a mega basic rundown of it all. Its not as in depth as it sounds. They dont just arbitrarily have 3 alphabets, each has its specific uses and you cant really get them mixed up. If i have left anything out, feel free to comment. I did my best for 4 am XD"

languagelearning,3c4lx8,TomQuicknutt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:57:27 2015 UTC,Hiragana then katakana before anything else. The japanese alphabet is phonetic so this will give you the correct pronunciation of Japanese words or at least closer than you would get doing only romaji (Japanese written with English letters). Then move on to phrases and grammar. Learning Kanji should be done concurrently when learning vocabulary because each Kanji character has multiple reading that will change depending on how its used. The sounds also change in compound words So instead of learning all the readings independently just learn the reading of Kanji as they appear in words.
languagelearning,3c4lx8,esaks,0,Tue Jul 7 12:07:28 2015 UTC,"Learn the kana (alphabets) first.   There is no way to know pronunciation of kanji without a dictionary. In Old Chinese there was some system, that let you guess sound more or less, then it was broken, then japanese take characters and give them their japanese pronunciation, obviously it didn't correlate :3 Characters was borrowed in long period of time from different chinese regions, so there about 3 chinese reading and some japanese, and a combinations of chinese and japanese.   行 reads kou / gyou / an (chinese, onyomi) and yuku / iku / okona / kudari (japanese, kunyomi)  方 — hou (on) and kata / masa (jap)  How does 行方 reads?

languagelearning,3c1vd9,catcircle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:40:42 2015 UTC,"Korean, Mandarin, and Japanese aren't related to each other (or more precisely, haven't been definitively shown to be related to each other). Korean and Japanese are both agglutinating languages with SOV order, but their similarities stem from the fact that both have been heavily influenced by Chinese."
languagelearning,3c1vd9,catcircle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:56:49 2015 UTC,Ah thanks. Im just aware that many kanji in Japanese stem from mandarin nouns
languagelearning,3c1vd9,catcircle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:26:45 2015 UTC,I think a problem OP would encounter with Arabic is that it's most likely MSA (modern standard) and not a dialect that is actually spoken. It'll be a disappointment for you knowing that MSA is only really used in formal situations - which will be only a portion of arabic culture.

Just keep speaking my friend, it's the only way to get there!"
languagelearning,3bzaw7,JuvenLe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:09:33 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity how many hours do you study per week?
languagelearning,3bzaw7,polyclod,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"Between 2-8 hrs a day, probably somewhere in the middle on your average day. It probably sounds like a lot but I watch a lot of TV shows in French at the moment, I watch the news in French, I listen to podcasts on public transport every day for ~1hr in French. What I'd consider actually study includes doing Anki (1hr) and the German Volume Method (1hr) each day. I also skype with French native speakers a few hours a week."
languagelearning,3bzaw7,JuvenLe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:13:42 2015 UTC,"I began to learn french recently at a very slow pace. I used to be proud of my accent but it's not even as good as yours was in the 3.5 months stage, so I'm kinda curious to see what people say about it because if yours is deemed not good enough mine should be hopeless.  As for your method of study I've found that it doesn't work for me, I can spend 3 hours watching english series but unless I make a conscious effort to pay attention to the pronunciation and vocabulary my english won't improve a bit. I will just be passively immersed in the series and I will ignore everything I don't know.  Also if you feel comfortable enough to post a video in Portuguese I can give you my opinion."
languagelearning,3bzaw7,polyclod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair I studied French for 6 years at high school. That said, I learnt next to nothing and only came back to learning it 10 years later (I'm 28 now). However, I feel like having done it through high school for that long helped with the accent as I still had it when I started again even 10 years later. But I also work on my accent ever day, reading aloud and using the Fluent Forever pronunciation trainer decks for French (hope to get the Portuguese one when it comes out).   Yeah I know my study method's pretty intense, you should definitely not take it as gospel, it's just what I've found I can do and enjoy doing.   My Portuguese right now is absolutely awful because I haven't done anymore than finish the Duolingo tree. I can read a lot, but speaking and listening wise I'm an absolute beginner. I'll switch to focusing on Portuguese full time 01/01/16. Definitely excited to start!   P.S. seeing as you speak or are learning English / French / Portuguese, let me know if you're interested in chatting to me on FB or Skype sometime as we could practice all those languages together!"

I studied French for 3 years at school but because I wasn't interested in it at the time I didn't learn much, it helped me with my accent though.  The Portuguese pronunciation isn't easy, it's definitely more difficult than the French, simply because we have a wider array of sounds but the grammar is similar to the French and since you already have a good grasp of French it should be easy for you.   P.S. seeing as you speak or are learning English / French / Portuguese, let me know if you're interested in chatting to me on FB or Skype sometime as we could practice all those languages together!

languagelearning,3c06eh,Tibble_Buns,3,Sat Jul 4 09:05:26 2015 UTC,"has anyone actually followed through with the no-English rule (even on a limited scale such as with a person or preselected persons) and was the relationship more than strictly for learning purposes? If yes, was the friendship significantly more difficult to maintain?   I've done it, but while in Korea studying Korean. (To be perfectly honest, I think the 100% target language rule is just not feasible in anything other than a coutry in which your target language is the native language.) I deliberately sought out friendships with people who spoke English incredibly poorly or not at all. Because I was in a position to do so, I almost always bought dinner, etc., for them. Was I using them? In a very few cases, there's no way that I would have hung out with them were it not for my desire to practice Korean, but in most cases the friendship was definitely real. As for whether that amounts to 'using' someone, that just seems like a bit of an odd question. Friendships often have curious motives, even when there is no language barrier."
languagelearning,3c06eh,Tibble_Buns,2,Sat Jul 4 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"I've done it with Mandarin.   Think of it this way: when you were a kid weren't you pretty much friends with everyone? Later on though, you find out more about yourself and start to drift towards certain types of people instead. I think this method is like that. Fortunately, there's been some friends that I've kept during my journey from close to the beginning all the way to now, but I've lost a lot too (which isn't necessarily bad). Just be open to the changes that happen.   I understand the feeling of feeling like using them. It's hard to compromise with that sometimes, but I always aim for half and half in our interactions. For example, we'll meet for an hour to do a language exchange, and in that hour the first half hour will be Mandarin, and the second will be English, but that's assuming they want to practice their English (or willing to).  There's also another group of people out there: ones that are just curious about your prospective on the world. If you can just give them an interesting experience just by talking to them, that can be enough sometimes, especially for older folks. If you can find older conversation partners (<40s), you'll find that they are interested in talking to someone with another perspective, have no desire to learn English, and have A LOT of patience. Most of my relationships are like this now (but now I'm having more friends my own age too). I only speak to my Chinese friends in English if they mention they want to practice English, which I'm totally willing to set up times.   All in all, I advocate speaking as soon as possible only in that language environment. See yourself as a newborn. By speaking this new language you are essentially starting over. Try to observe in the widest scope possible: body language, interjections, prosody, cultural difference in interaction; these all count as part of the language. I see language learning as acting, you have to learn to become Chinese, not just speak it."

languagelearning,3by2jg,ehsahr,10,Fri Jul 3 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"There was a video I watched a while back, where these two guys claimed to speak only in the language they wanted to learn, when speaking with each other. Within three months, they said they were comfortable speaking about nearly any topic in the language. They repeated this process several times, with several languages, with similar results.  I haven't tried it, myself, so I can't speak to whether it works for me, but it's something I'm very interested in trying. The next language I want to learn is Russian, as well!  Here's the video.  I don't know how familiar you are with language learning, but there are also the strategies frequently mentioned on here. By far, the one I see most often is to consume media in your target language. Books, music, TV shows, etc. Right now, I'm watching TV shows in German, and pausing whenever I find a word I don't know, or sentence structure I don't understand.  Apps like Memrise and Duolingo are great for the basics, although Duolingo's Russian course isn't due until early August. Memrise has a Cyrillic alphabet lesson set, which I recommend, as learning the alphabet is pretty important.  And try not to get lazy with pronunciation! Some of the most fun I have is trying to nail the pronunciation of a given language! It's fine when you start out, if you can't get some of the pronunciation correct, but you won't get very far with native speakers if they can't understand you.  Oh, and learn the slang, when you feel comfortable enough. Idioms and other colloquial jargon are fun to learn, and the particularly common ones are pretty useful to know. And the ones that are strange, and don't translate directly are easy to remember, because of how unusual they are."

I can't speak from experience about learning with a partner, but one of the biggest things I struggled with in Russian was speaking/pronunciation. Maybe speak to one another in the language as much as possible, or even plan to have periods of ""no English"" time.   Also, if you guys enjoy singing, one of my favourite ways to practice spewing out those tricky consonant clusters is just to find some Russian music on youtube, and sing along while reading the lyrics. Folk songs work  well!    Something to look out for is stressing the correct syllable in words - for instance, it can make the difference between the ""o"" being pronounced as an ""o"", or an ""a"".

Je suis encore en Finlande, me reposant un peu et essayant de pratiquer mon finnois. Mais pour l'instant je n'ai pas de confiance en mon capacité d'utiliser la langue. Pour ceux qui peuvent le parler couramment, je suis jaloux...  Les finlandais (les finnois?) sont, comme la plupart de l'Europe, préoccupés parce que la crise grecque signale qu'il y ait une possibilité d'un ""Grexit"", et le gouvernement grec n'a pas payé sa dette, et si les grecs abandonnent l'Euro, l'Italie, l'Espagne, et des autres pays peuvent considérer la même cours d'action.

Mais vous connaissez bien, je suis sûr, l'«austérité», des limitations financières imposées sur le gouvernement.  Le problème est que si la Grèce ne peut pas payer sa dette (il a déjà raté un payement!), l'UE va ""renégocier"" sa place dans la zone d'euro, et peut être ne va plus permettre sa participation. La Grèce ne pourra pas utiliser l'euro, et sans de l'aide étrangère, son économie va s'écouler, au niveau plus profond. Il y aura probablement plusieurs années de dépression économique avant que l'économie puisse encore croître. Ça sera aussi difficile d'importer des produits étrangers parce que leur argent va dévaluer. Leurs produits exportées seront en croissance parce qu'ils seront pas trop chers... Mais encore il prendra beaucoup de temps avant de pouvoir ressayer de rentrer la zone d'euro.  Tous ces problèmes ne sont pas aidés par Alexis Tsipras, qui paraît un peu fou... Il prend trop de risques et les grecs vont être blessés.  C'est plus facile à expliquer en anglais parcs que c'est ma langue maternelle mais en faisant ça je ne pratiquerais pas mon français!

À l'école technique, on apprend à travailler dans une carrière ""blue collar"" comme la technologie d'information, la soudage, l'ingénierie, et al, et après ça on peut aller à l'université polytechnique.

Viajé por un viaje de servicio en que hacía servicio como pintando y haciendo algunas cosas para el pueblo, pero también hacía muchas cosas divertidas.  Jugaba fútbol mucho con los adultos, y también jugaba con los niños para un parte de mi servicio (fue muy divertido también, no me sintió como servicio).   No tengo mucho consejo, porque no sé si mi plan de mirar TV en español y usar anki irá bien. Si este plan va bien, todo mi consejo es hacer este, pero si va mal, mi consejo es hacer algo otro, tal vez usando Duolingo, o libros de gramática (pero sé que casi nadie le gusta leer libros de gramática)  En una nota diferente ¿Eres un tico? ¿De donde son tu familia y tu? Es posible que sabes de donde fui, o que tu familia sabe. (Estaba en La Paz, y fui a Palmares en ruta a San Jose, y estaba en San Jose mi primer noche y mi ultimo noche."

It's more common to use the adverb form of languages with ""učit se"", as opposed to the noun. ""I learn Czechly"". And ""pro"" is never used for periods of time like ""for"" is in English - it can only be used when something is designated for a certain person or entity. For your usage, you'd say ""na"" instead, but it's not necessary in this case."

languagelearning,3bux8e,oeguest,37,Thu Jul 2 10:27:02 2015 UTC,"Ferriss's ""fluency"" is basically just a high beginner level, so it's not surprising that he can do it in 2-12 months.  Learn basic sentence structures, the 2,000 300-500 most common words, and any vocab specific to your interests.  Then declare victory and move on.  Basically the one positive thing I can say is that he advocates live practice to polish your speaking skills."
languagelearning,3bux8e,krnm,-1,Thu Jul 2 14:43:15 2015 UTC,so it's not surprising that he can do it in 2-12 months.   That's completely natural if you study for 1-3 hours or more per day even for reasonable definitions of fluency.
languagelearning,3bux8e,misplaced_my_pants,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you study for 3 hours a day, 6 days a week for a full year (making sure to consume lots of native materials, such as music, videos, games, and most importantly conversing with native speakers) it is not unreasonable to be at a high level of speaking. I would say that you could get to a high B2/C1 in that time."
languagelearning,3bux8e,Piplup22301,13,Fri Jul 3 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"Apart from the fact that this is advice is old news, from his story it also seemed like he spent a really long time abroad so I don't see how his method was any more useful to him since almost anything would've gotten him to reading level in 11 months anyway."
languagelearning,3bux8e,Hyperlingual,47,Thu Jul 2 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"quickly get fluent   Welp, definitely not watching this one."
languagelearning,3bux8e,galaxyrocker,14,Thu Jul 2 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"A large part of the problem is the word ""fluent"": it doesn't mean anything.  Or, to be more precise, the definition is extremely loose.  In my experience with language-learning, ""fluent"" means whatever the hell the person using it wants it to mean...and you can get away with that, too, precisely because of what I just said: the definition allows it by being very vague.  There's a reason that word is practically verboten in professional linguistic and experienced language-learning circles (it's not literally 'forbidden' but just very taboo because everybody  dislikes it for the reasons stated above).  We need to encourage the use of more precise, well-defined terminology like what CEFR uses: A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.  Yes, if I'm speaking to lay people I'll use a term like ""conversationally fluent"" but even then I'll clearly define it so everyone understands what I mean when I use it."
languagelearning,3bux8e,SexualMaltedBarley,11,Thu Jul 2 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, but people often misuse the A1, A2... etc. ratings. These ratings are based on an evaluation conducted by a third party. Many people think that they can ""self rate"" and in doing so, they almost inevitably give themselves a higher rating (at least at the lower levels).  The other problem with this system is that the gaps between the ratings are not consistent. Getting from A2 to B1 is WAY HARDER than getting from A1 to A2 and getting from B2 to C1 is SIGNIFICANTLY harder and takes SIGNIFICANTLY longer than from A2 to B1. People think, well I've been at B1 for about a year now, so I really ought to be a B2 by now and that's not the way it works.  I think it would be better to just have a R-0 to R-120 rating (where 0 is nothing at all and 100 is very proficient or the level of your average, everyday native speaker, with the values over 100 reserved for people reaching the above-average proficiency of professional writers/speakers, professors, etc.).   With this system, you could say ""if you know everything in this book, you are at least at a R-50 rating"" (you could know more of course) and books written in the language could be rated (like books that say ""for children 8 years and up"", the book could say ""for R-70 and above""."

languagelearning,3bux8e,WhaleMeatFantasy,-1,Thu Jul 2 20:37:02 2015 UTC,There are videos of him speaking in Japanese and German that I've seen.
languagelearning,3bux8e,misplaced_my_pants,11,Fri Jul 3 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"Lots of people are being snarky in this thread because his methods are a) not exactly ground breaking and b) are fairly limited in the results they can achieve. However I will say that language learning environments, cultures and practices vary massively depending on the target language and whilst this kind of thing is obvious and implemented for beginners in most of the common languages it is still uncommon in a lot of more fringe languages.   I am learning Dutch and Czech and the learning community/experience for Dutch is lightyears ahead of the Czech (though the gap is closing a bit). In Czech it is pretty common still to be taken through all the conjugations and declinations as part of the beginner course, its soul destroying. As a beginner you just want to be able to operate in a very basic way and most czech learning is just not set up for that. I wish a lot of the teachers of Czech would watch this and take it on board as how to give some just that small bridge head in a language before they can really explore it fully."
languagelearning,3bux8e,theYword,5,Thu Jul 2 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's basically Ferriss's schtick; why be great at something when you can be good enough in a fraction of the time?  But you're right, what he proposes is good as a first step, or for people who only need a basic grasp of the language.  I often hear English students using the present tense with time words to clarify:    When I go to work yesterday, this man ask me for money.  I tell him I have no money but I give him my lunch.  He thank me many times and tell me he pay me back someday.     It's not great, but it gets the job done, and that's the most important thing.  However, I think Ferriss is taking advantage of the ambiguity of a word like ""fluent.""  In an old post about learning Japanese, Ferriss claims to have learned years' worth of classroom Japanese in two months, but immediately after admits that his Japanese is practically useless unless he's talking about judo."

languagelearning,3bux8e,languagecrawler,2,Thu Jul 2 19:54:02 2015 UTC,Can someone deconstruct what i really need to know in german?
languagelearning,3bux8e,manu_facere,4,Thu Jul 2 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"Basically what he's saying is to learn the most common 500-2,000 words and the 3-5 verb tenses that everybody needs, and beyond that, only spend time on things that are relevant to your interests.  So my answer might be quite different from yours.    For example, I have a Spanish vocabulary book here at my desk; let's flip through the subjects and see what's worth my time:     Medicine (words like aching, drowsy, and insurance):  Several of my clients are hospitals, so that's high priority. Science (proton, momentum, density): makes for interesting reading material, and easy since many of the words are similar to English.  Moderate priority. Arts (playwright, understudy, masterpiece): I like the arts, but I can live without these words for a while.  Low priority. Academia (notebook, research, homework): I think I'm done with formal education for a while.  Won't bother studying, I'll pick up what I need as I need it.   Your order might be completely different though.  If you're learning German to study abroad, Academia would be very important."
languagelearning,3bux8e,krnm,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"I wanna say ideally, we would love to be able to talk about medicine, natural sciences, arts, academia etc in our target language but it definitely depends on priority and how the language pertains to what we do. For me, I had to learn industry terms in Spanish for work and I am still working on learning more and more terms as I can come across terms in emails that I have never seen before.  It's because of this that I can see why Tim Ferriss came up with this method. It's like when we first began learning a language, one of the first things you try to do is to be able to introduce yourself, what you do, why you are learning the language and etc."
languagelearning,3bux8e,Me_talking,3,Thu Jul 2 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"Sure! In German, you don't need to worry too much about verb conjugations and all that jazz. That's a headache for romance-language learners, but not so much here. The Germans, though, make up for it by having difficult case and agreement patterns. What this means is that the articles, adjectives, and nouns all have to 'agree' with regards to the gender of the noun, the number, and the case (grammatical role) of the noun. For example:   Ein guter Arzt (a good doctor) Eine gute Reise (a good trip) Ein gutes Buch (a good book)   In English the words 'a' and 'good' don't care what comes after them, but in German they do. In this case they change because those three nouns all differ in grammatical gender. This is therefore called gender agreement. 'Arzt' is masculine, 'Reise' is feminine, and 'Buch' is neuter; note that these are most often entirely arbitrary.   Gute Ärzte (good doctors) Ich kenne einen guten Arzt (I know a good doctor)   The first of the above examples refers to multiple doctors, so 'gut' takes a plural ending. This is number agreement. The second involves the accusative case, which refers to the role of the noun in the sentence. You can look up more about cases yourself, but in this situation 'Arzt' is the object, not the subject, of the verb. This is case agreement.  This is all very annoying to learn. However, it's very front-loaded; once you get it down you don't really have to worry about it anymore. There are certain other tricky parts about German, but I wanted to talk about this because it's the one that's the most intimidating really catches students off guard. Hopefully it helped, feel free to ask if you have any questions. Also, I'm not confident in my German at all, so there's a chance of errors in my examples. Even if there are, I think the point still gets across."

languagelearning,3bux8e,feedmefeces,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"For novices, it definitely isn't.   It's only obvious in hindsight, which is why so many people have to be told of the existence and utility of frequency lists."
languagelearning,3bux8e,misplaced_my_pants,-3,Fri Jul 3 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"No, it's completely obvious. Other than a retard, who would think that you shouldn't learn common words, but rather less common words first? I'm not denying that idiots exist, but just because some particular thing isn't obvious to an idiot doesn't mean that it's not obvious."
languagelearning,3bux8e,feedmefeces,4,Fri Jul 3 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"Tell that to the mainstream language-learning industry which fails to utilize frequency lists in most textbooks and courses.   There's a reason subs like this have to exist and that's because things like frequency lists just aren't on most people's radar. It's not that they actively disagree with the idea that frequency lists are useful; it literally doesn't occur to people that such lists exist and that they can be used. And honestly the idea that the top 2000 words can get you to 80% comprehension or whatever the statistic is is just not obvious to anyone; it's surprising to most people.   And even then, without SRS software that number would look really intimidating."
languagelearning,3bux8e,misplaced_my_pants,2,Fri Jul 3 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"Just because they are not literally going through a frequency list doesn't mean they are not going through common words before less common ones. Can you give me an example of a textbook or course which does otherwise?  Also, there's no real need to fetishize frequency lists. Words appear high in a frequency list because, well, they are common, and so any sort of exposure to native literature, film, radio etc. is going to end up exposing you to those words. Of course, if you want to specifically go through a list like that, then you can, but it's hardly necessary. You'll pick up common words one way or another, because, well, they are common!   And honestly the idea that the top 2000 words can get you to 80% comprehension   That's actually a bit of a myth."
languagelearning,3bux8e,feedmefeces,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:18:29 2015 UTC,"Can you give me an example of a textbook or course which does otherwise?   Like every textbook used in US schools? You learn all sorts of vocabulary that you rarely use. It's usually because it's easier in a textbook format to present vocab in terms of related categories of words whereas frequency lists are more amenable to flashcard formats.    That's actually a bit of a myth.   This is gonna need a citation.   Obviously it probably varies from language to language and the actual numbers might be different as I said in my earlier comment, but the idea that the top however many words don't get you to X% comprehension of a given snippet of speech or text is far more kinda the opposite of what you've been arguing is patently obvious.   An SRS deck of the top 2-3k words in conjunction with consuming media is vastly more efficient than how most language-learners outside of the polyglot community go about acquiring a vocabulary. Even Ferriss only goes as far as the top few hundred words in old post of his that's been linked in this thread."
languagelearning,3bux8e,misplaced_my_pants,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:18:53 2015 UTC,"Just because a textbook throws in some less common words along with the more common words doesn't mean that it's breaking the principle of teaching common, core, highly used vocabulary before less common vocabulary. It's just that it's natural, when proceeding thematically, to throw in some less common but tightly related vocabulary along the way."
languagelearning,3bux8e,feedmefeces,0,Fri Jul 3 08:29:51 2015 UTC,"Don't be such a pretentious prick. When beginning an autodidactic approach to foreign languages, many people have no idea where to start. If you're being genuine, this is a prime example of the curse of knowledge bias."

languagelearning,3bux8e,saphanbaal,4,Fri Jul 3 02:17:47 2015 UTC,"Well, given the qualification, novice. I think if you don't know anything about learning languages, or any topic for that matter, you won't necessarily recognize that some concepts are more important than others.  I think we, as language enthusiasts, know this quite well. We look up material like this all the time.  Why would Tim Ferriss go out of his way pointing out something obvious? Is he stupid?  I think there's a certain loss of perspective. It's easy to see as a veteran that certain structures and patterns like verb conjugations and topics happen at a much higher frequency than others. But if you don't know this, you'll just spend your time studying ""everything"", which isn't time efficient. And time efficiency happens to be another important language learning tip, that I'm sure a lot of people here already know.  But the people in this subreddit typically aren't novices.

But nothing about sports.  I'm sure eventually you'll get to a point of realizing, hey,  my input is not matching my desired output. But this ability to self-reflect won't come immediately when you barely know how sentences work or how to greet people properly without offending them or their mother.  It's insulting of you to create this dichotomy of ""idiots do X and non-idiots are clearly better than that"". There's a spectrum of language learning skill levels."

languagelearning,3bwhqm,DatGuyWill,11,Thu Jul 2 18:50:46 2015 UTC,While doing a lot everyday will cause you to progress quickly it is important to remember to review as you will forget things if you are learning a lot everyday. The ideal thing would be to do at least some work each day consistently as opposed to doing a lot one day and nothing for the rest of the week.
languagelearning,3bwhqm,Mackgu3,8,Thu Jul 2 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe set yourself a minimum of 30 minutes per day, and then whenever you feel especially motivated do more. That way you have contact with the language at least once per day.  In the early stages there's not much you can do with the language yet, so it's probably best to pace yourself and save the marathon sessions for later."
languagelearning,3bwhqm,polyclod,3,Thu Jul 2 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"It won't hurt to invest a lot of time now and less later, but you should always regularly keep in contact with the language, preferably each day, and not see huge investments for example on the weekend as making up for time not spent during the week.  Just don't force yourself to just do exercises and grammar all day long or you might burn out as well, you can expose yourself in other ways as well (even if it's just watching a movie with French subtitles)."
languagelearning,3bwhqm,zqom,3,Thu Jul 2 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's a few different stages of language learning... the first one is the only one where limiting it really is kind of important, if just because you start to get bleary and can't retain as much when you're cramming a ton of new stuff into your head.   After you know enough grammar/vocab to where more of your time spent learning is spent speaking/reading/listening/writing than actually studying, at that point you can (and should) spend as much time as you have available using the language. For starting out though... figure out what you can sustainably do and maintain. Especially if you're going to use Anki or something to manage reviewing, you don't want to bury yourself by the end of the first week in stuff you kind of only sort of remember."
languagelearning,3bwhqm,adventuringraw,3,Thu Jul 2 19:51:57 2015 UTC,Find the pace you can handle long term and stick to it. Have a minimum that's easy to achieve each day and if you feel on any given day of going over it then do so :D
languagelearning,3bwhqm,PeteDarwin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:50:52 2015 UTC,"You can practice everyday for an infinite amount of time, if you know what you're doing. Don't expect to sit down and learn vocabulary for eight hours; you'll only waste time. Spending a lot of time learning new material has a trend of diminishing returns, and if you try to juggle too many new concepts at once, you won't retain them as well.  Instead, learn something new each day, and spend any additional time you want to study your language by applying it. Read anything you can, write something, speak as much as possible, listen to people speak, listen to music or watch movies/TV.  Don't sit down and expect to grind through a textbook. Take lessons in one day at a time, and then go nuts on media and language production."
languagelearning,3bwhqm,AshNazg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your motivation and skill. My opinion is that generally slower is better. You build natural familiarity with a language by long-term exposure to it, so that rather than cramming your head with unfamiliar things that you will run a high risk of forgetting, you spend more leisurely time with something that you're comfortable and familiar with. Also with less stress you probably learn better. At the beginning stages it seems like you're making slow progress, but eventually it starts to snowball because if you fully mastered lower levels, you can tackle more advanced stuff with ease as opposed to someone who rushed through the elementary stuff and now struggles with the next level.  But here's the thing, while slow is good, sometimes you can put in extra studying and reap the benefits. If you feel really motivated and compelled to study more, then do it. Also, of course, never miss an opportunity to practice what you already know.  I remember I started learning Turkish from Memrise. It fascinated me and I got super excited, so I power-studied for several hours, like one or two hours a day (maybe more). Eventually the excitement wore off and I slacked off, but I retained most of what I learned, and the initial rush of information gave me a really solid foundation on understanding Turkish grammar and verb tenses.  However, forcing yourself to do something you don't really want to do, like practice a language all day to the point where it bores you will hinder your learning process. On the other hand, if it doesn't bore you and you really want to do that, then go ahead. :D"
languagelearning,3bwhqm,marmulak,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:34:40 2015 UTC,"You should think off little goals for every week. I'm not an advocate of time tables, so I suggest that you have at least 30 min for learning new stuff and try to use time that gets wasted (e.g. waiting for a train/bus to arrive, standing in a queue or driving for a long time). If you get into the habbit the progress is better retainable in my opinion. A tip that I want to give is to record yourself. If you compare the audios you will notice your progress and see that it is working. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress but it is not true."
languagelearning,3bxjmp,tonydiv,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"The article probably should have mentioned the game Influent, which makes use of this concept."
languagelearning,3bx3y8,vendetta1105,3,Thu Jul 2 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"How would you recommend we structure our learning? Any and all advice is very much appreciated.   The vast majority of arrangements like this do not work. In fact, I have never seen one work in all my life. So my first piece of advice is that you not let it cause stress in your relationship. You are not her teacher and she is not yours.  Your learning does not depend on hers and her learning does not depend on yours.    Don't study together. If you do lessons or tutoring with someone, you can take those together but do not do daily study together. If your daily study sessions depend on both of you participating, then you are making it twice as likely that any session will be skipped. Think about it, you are busy and can't study so your wife uses that as an excuse to skip as well because she has something she needs to do as well but was going to put it off until after the study session but since you aren't there... And it's just as likely for the reverse to occur. If it just so happens that your study times coincide at times, that's excellent. But both of you should commit to being independent students.  Study in 3 small chunks of no more than 30 minutes. 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes in the afternoon, 30 minutes at night. By dividing your study up like this problems that come up unexpectedly are less likely to keep you from not studying at all on any given day. If you start your day off studying but then something comes up at work and you cannot do your second or third session, at least you did 20 or 25 minutes. Remember that frequency trumps absolute time. 6 or 7 hours over 7 days is better than 8 hours over 4 different days. If you can, learn new things in the nightly sessions and review them in the morning. One of the things sleep is supposed to do is help us consolidate memories. You can use this to your advantage by learning new things at night and then reviewing them in the morning. Keeping in mind number 3... If there is something about your studies that you find boring or tedious and you notice you are tending to not take seriously or not complete, do that in the morning so you are less likely to skip it due to being tired. An example might be writing texts. It's hard and requires focus so it might be best to do writing exercises in the mornings so that you are sure you get them done. Watching a video, listening to music, reading for pleasure and similar tasks do not count as study unless you are using them as study. What I mean here is that your study time needs to be focused and active. If you are watching a 2 minute 30 second video, then you need to be doing comprehension exercises or writing a summary in the target language for it to count as study. Listening to ChinaPod101 while you garden is helpful but it is not study time. I'm not saying you can't or should not do those things, you can. I do them all the time and they really help. But learning a language that is not spoken where you live is going to require focus and you can't do that with divided attention."

Because essentially it will simulate how you learned Spanish. Listen and repeat. Don't ask questions, just listen to native speakers, repeat what they say, and try it out from there!  edit: I should also mention that the Assimil course is really fantastic as well.

languagelearning,3bt904,astromule,10,Wed Jul 1 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"With Assimil, it kinda feels like there are three major ""generations"" of texts. The distinctions are easier to see with the major languages of the series- and of course not every language had an offering in all of the phases. You've been through all three with Italian- the 50's-60's series, the 80's-90's, then the newer releases from the 21st century. In general, the 80's-90's tend to be the most highly-regarded. They're extremely comprehensive, and while the characteristic ""humor"" remains, there's very little hand-holding. You're either doing the work necessary to keep up, or you're not.   The earliest generation is a bit more traditional. There are, for example, vocabulary lists, but this is clearly the beginning of the ""method"" and Assimil finally nails it with the next wave. The latest releases then take that extremely successful method then kinda dumbs it down a bit. That's not a bad thing- dialogues are shorter and snappier and the language is more colloquial and updated- but please don't anyone be turned off by the ""outdatedness"" of the terminology in the older courses. The whole point of Assimil (and why it's so preferred by hardcore language nerds worldwide) is that it's not about ""this is how you say it."" What you're learning- without really being directly told- is the ""why."" The new versions are still Assimil, they're just facing the realities of a changing market.  Another big difference to look out for involves whether or not you're dealing with a Romance Language. The series is French, and since the whole point of the method is to feed you exposure to material which is designed in a way to get you to where you're intuitively understanding new information, there's a sense where even in English adaptations, you're still dealing with the fact that the original authors are assuming fluency in French and, therefore, an understanding of certain basics you'll see in related languages. It's not that the English adaptations don't cover this, the difference is more visible in pace, the book's expectations on the learner, and that kind of thing. Compare the relative difficultly in the content of the first few lessons of Spanish Without Toil vs German Without Toil and the difference becomes evident. When Assimil does lose a bit of the magic, it's usually with languages which are structurally very removed from French. Some of the Arabic and Korean courses suffer from overcompensation for the obviously considerable differences in approaches to expression. With Italian, on the other hand, you can jump right in. All that said, versions of the same course adapted into different languages can be quite different. OP could look at the most recent English version of Assimil Russian from 2011- it's a highly edited adaptation of the late 90's series course where everything has been pared down. There's less overall content, but it's much better about maintaining balance. I used to think that the content of the course for whatever language would be the same across the bases- and it turns out that is absolutely not the case. You'll have a sometimes very different experience going at it from Spanish, French or English, even before the fact that, for example, there are only English adaptations for the first two of the three Italian courses OP has been through. (Just asked about this last week)  Assimil Hungarian is one of my favorite language learning texts of all time, period. FSI Hungarian is also excellent. FSI German is also fantastic, but their Assimil courses aren't as meaty as the texts falling into in the main Assimil strongpoint of romance languages for romance language speakers (I don't study Dutch, but granted people seem to be into what Assimil has done with it). I do like both of the Russians available in English. They have their own uses, Russian without Toil (1951) is very similar to- but still a bit different from- the 1971 course you used. It's extremely formal, but that works with Slavic-style grammar. Another plus is that the text does a good job with avoiding the ""Ha ha. Communists."" angle that is way too overdone in so many other learning materials from that same era. The 2011 text is more fun and almost cute. It's complicated with Assimil, there are so many versions and editions of each language in so many bases, but the method is great for self-study, and rarely are things ever truly horrible."
languagelearning,3bt904,redthendead,3,Thu Jul 2 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this excellent explanation. By the way, if you and Polyclod create an ""Assimil"" sub, I'll join. :)"
languagelearning,3bt904,polyclod,9,Thu Jul 2 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/redthendead, the third generation of Assimil courses (from the 1980s-1990s) is definitely my favorite.  This was back when the courses carried the title Language X with Ease (or X sans peine in French).  They are probably the best mix of old and new that I have encountered.  I have successfully used both New French With Ease and German With Ease in my study of these two languages, and can attest to their quality.  They are hands down the best introduction to French and German that I have come across. At the rate of one lesson per day (as recommended by Assimil), I was able to get to a solid intermediate level within about 6 months.    The genius of Assimil lies in its format (parallel texts, one side in L1, the other in L2, and audio recording solely in the target language), and it is simply a mindfuck for me that other companies don't use it.  The courses allow you to gradually assimilate the grammar and vocabulary relatively painlessly (or as they used to say ""without toil"") by spending the first three months or so merely passively listening and reading to short texts.  During the last half of the course you begin to practice your active skills, by re-translating the text from your native language into the target language.  What you are left with is basically what one reviewer described as the ability to speak like ""an intelligent child"".  You have a vocabulary of some 2,000 words, a decent grip on the grammar, and can now move on to both advanced courses and native materials with little trouble.  (I have only used one Assimil ""advanced course"", Using French, and it's very good, but not mandatory if you have access to native speakers and materials to teach you idioms, colloquial speech, etc.) Obviously the ""B2"" on the front of the package is marketing hype, but if you take what you've learned from Assimil and actually start using the language, I see no reason why you couldn't reach a higher level in a relatively short amount of time.  What makes the third generation of Assimil so special is its comprehensiveness and its charm.  Most of the lessons in New French With Ease(and to a somewhat lesser extend German With Ease) are witty, fun to work through, and never feel like drudgery.  They are packed with useful grammar and cultural notes and explanations that make them valuable for re-study...indeed, I fully plan on revising both the French and German courses many more times in the future to completely internalize the content.    These courses treated you as an adult which, sadly, is not the case with the newest generation (Assimil no longer adds the With Ease moniker to its courses, so now the courses are simply X Language (i.e., Assimil German).  Thankfully they haven't ruined updated the French course for English speakers yet.  These newer generations are thinner on details and notes, and the audio has been slowed down even more to the point where the courses never seem to reach a normal tempo.  (I use Audacity to speed up the audio for the older courses for Shadowing, and while there's some gaps in the first handful of lessons, eventually towards the end of the course the pace gets closer to the tempo of a real conversation).  Assimil seems to be following the same trend as other language learning publishers...i.e., ""the learner is probably too stupid to learn a language, so we have to dumb it down and make it as 'fun' as possible"".  For more evidence of this, you only need look at Duolingo and other attemps to ""gamify"" studying.  I agree that studying doesn't need to feel like mindless toil, but honestly the previous generations of Assimil were already successful in making learning fun and fruitful.  I have no idea why this model had to be changed.  That being said, even with all of the defects of the newer courses, I still think Assimil is the best on the market.  It's light years ahead of Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, Teach Yourself, etc.  Not every course is of the same quality...the Arabic course is supposedly awful, which is a shame since this is such an important language.  A general rule of thumb for me is that if Assimil doesn't produce a quality course in a language (which is very rarely the case), you can find an equal or better quality course with Linguaphone.  Indeed, Linguaphone's Arabic and Mandarin Chinese courses are supposed to be excellent.  Later on I'll post a bit about FSI, which I also highly regard in most cases."
languagelearning,3bt904,redthendead,5,Thu Jul 2 12:03:47 2015 UTC,"I use Audacity to speed up the audio for the older courses   Dude. Are you me? ""Change tempo without changing pitch"" is like the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of language nerding. If you ever make it to China, we need to beer or something.    More on the FSI courses- I get the feeling we'll have similar thoughts. Some of the courses are just better organized and more complete. I like the Hungarian and German courses because in addition to the substitution grammar drill jackhammerfest, they also do a ton of vocabulary and translation drills for each lesson. On top of that being more exposure, it just makes it easier when you're going it alone to have more base-language reference to fall back on just in case.    Courses like FSI French only have the target drills, then they spend more pages presenting grammar explanations instead of examples, where personally I'd prefer more actual sentences. When there are drilled phrases, they tend to be ""useful words"" disembodied from the content of the dialogues. The recordings for French are also maybe a little less than ideal. In the dialogues, Hungarian and German give you new word+new word+new sentence, where French has the identical format in the printed text but the speakers do a weird build-up thing starting at the end of the sentence then repeating, adding sections to the front of the phrase. That's fine in a sense because there's such an argument for the logic of Assimil's essentially total avoidance of vocabulary lists- you're supposed to focus on getting concepts and entire thoughts across instead of stalling in x=y, ""this word means this"" binarisms. So, that's cool and all, but give us more examples to work with in the drills, then.    The only other FSI course I've really gone to town with is Serbo-croatian, which is kinda in the middle. The lessons let you hear all the new vocabulary, but then the drills are more like the way things work with the French course. That's still a nice course, the text gives the dialogues in both the Croatian and Serbian (in Cyrillic) variants, and the recordings stick to Serbian readings. I do like the FSI courses a whole lot, but if they were all like German and Hungarian, I'd like them even more."
languagelearning,3bt904,polyclod,2,Thu Jul 2 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know why the French course skimps out on the drills, honestly I wish it would've been more like the Spanish course.  I really think doing the drills on the Spanish subjunctive has helped me become more fluid in my speech. I like seeing the results ""in the real world"".  That's why I took Assimil Using French and sped up the audio, so that I could fill in the gaps that they left in the FSI French course. It's still a good course, and I like the Phonology Course they have as well. But I think you'd get more return on your investment of time with the Spanish and German courses.  I haven't used any of the other courses yet, but apparently some are quite good and thorough(Chinese), and then some complete shit (Italian, apparently it's basically just a phonology course).  I've also been looking at some of the DLI courses, which have a different selection of languages available. I got excited when I saw they have an intermediate-advanced Dutch course, I'd like to use it after I finish Assimil. The audio unfortunately needs to be cleaned up, but hey it's public domain so for the ""price"" I'm not complaining."

Change Tempo just speeds up the playback so the conversation is faster, but the voices don't get higher and start sounding like Mickey Mouse. Besides the unnecessary pauses that you can cut out, the speakers on some of the Assimil tapes read way too slowly for natural speech (but this happens a lot with only the first two weeks of lessons- often things get more normal at Lesson 14). With Change Tempo you can increase speed without too much effect on sound quality or pronunciation clarity. Just select the entire section you want to make faster then up it a bit when the window pops up. It'll ask for a percentage, but your exact figure is going to depend on what you want and how fast the recording is. There will be a preview option before it commits the changes, so play with it until you're getting a rhythm you like. Back to Russian and the differences between base languages- in contrast to how you found the tapes, I sped up the recordings for the English version of your older text, but found the speed on the newer text to be just fine. The newer edition's sound files just had the first set of dialogues repeated before the Exercises section, and I didn't need that so I cut them.    Another non-mind-blowing tip on Audacity: ""Amplify."" Sometimes increasing the volume helps with clarity, too. Nothing too drastic or it defeats the purpose :D"

I could see a newcomer who was learning Ukrainian and Russian struggling a little, but after a getting proficient in one of the languages there should be no confusion, and it would be easy enough to add the other language in.  As to Esperanto there are studies that show studying Esperanto can help you learn another language at a greater pace. So some people advocate learning Esperanto to gain an understanding of grammar etc before moving onto to studying a non-constructed foreign language. Studies of Esperanto have shown that the language has the least benefit for those wanting to learn a Slavic language.

languagelearning,3bthum,Ginsbergs-girlfriend,3,Thu Jul 2 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"If you have an interest in learning both Ukrainian and Russian, learn one first and then the other. Belarusian comes as a breeze since I know Russian fairly well. However if you are only interested in Russian, learning Ukrainian at the same time will be confusing and counter productive. There are enough Russian resources out there to get a good command of the language without having to rely on resources designed for learning another language."
languagelearning,3bthum,morton_luthor,3,Thu Jul 2 11:13:48 2015 UTC,"In your situation, I do believe learning Esperanto can be a good idea. There are many aspects of Rusian that do not exist in English : a different alphabet, cases, genders, conjugations... And all of that can be daunting for someone who never properly learned a foreign language before. I'd say your experience with French doesn't count, sorry. I'm from Quebec myself and the amount of people here who studied English for more than 10 years and can't even align 3 words properly is astounding!  I know it sounds counter-productive to some people, but breaking your foreign language teeth on Esperanto, a language so easy you can realistically expect fluency in about six months, is a good start. And not only about practical stuff, if it only served as a self-esteem booster, to show you can learn a language in a timely manner, it's still worth it in my opinion. And maybe studying it will make you like it a bit more.  That being said, if you hate the bare idea of Esperanto, don't make it a chore because some scientist said it could help and some internet stranger said you should. Spending the time necessary, you will learn Russian even if you only study it. And so what if it takes 6 months more or less, language learning isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.  Disclaimer : although I'm interested in Russian and plan on learning it someday, I currently don't speak it at all and know almost nothing about it, besides the fact it has six cases and uses the Cyrillic alphabet."
languagelearning,3bthum,BastouXII,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. My tongue in cheek reference about english schools teaching french was basically me acknowledging the french I have is so rudimentary to not count as a learned language (which is also why I say I am looking to start a second language, not a third). So basically I agree, my experience with french doesn't count.  My idea is to indeed wait for the russian duolingo to move into beta to use it. So with a month or possibly months of waiting to go, I'll use esperanto to help grasping languages in general. I may not have a romantic vibe from esperanto, but I find it's ease of learning extremely satisfying. I am just not sure if that is enough to hold me more then 6 months."

Ukrainian and Russian are both a Cyrillic language. Just think of it as American English and UK English, both are practically the same language but both have different terms and subjects. I recommend learning the one you would actually use first, then you can use that knowledge to learn the second one.

languagelearning,3brrqy,Brawldud,18,Wed Jul 1 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"As a native Spanish speaker, my advice is: don't get any accent because it's easier, but because you like it better.  Said that, there's not a British or American accent: they vary from region to region, the same way any other language does. So Scottish accent (which I love) is also British. I also think it's better for a foreigner to stay neutral, otherwise you might sound odd or funny to native speakers."
languagelearning,3brrqy,palopolo,8,Wed Jul 1 17:48:17 2015 UTC,"Small tip, it's ""That said"" not ""Said that"" (your English is all fine other than that though).  Also, it's not really possible to be neutral sometimes, as with words like ""water"" you're going to pronounce it in a certain way which will usually sound either American or English. It's hard to be neutral with a lot of words as you'll generally sound either English or American, for example Americans would generally pronounce water as ""War - der"" whereas the English would usually say ""War - tuh"". There definitely is an ""English"" and an ""American"" accent, they just vary depending on which part of the US/England you're in, however almost all English and all American accents are still noticeably English/American."

languagelearning,3brrqy,njtwkr,3,Wed Jul 1 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"Here's another area of American and British differences - in Standard American English, we would describe water as being pronounced either 'wawder' or 'wahder'.  Since we pronounce /r/ almost exclusively where there is a written <r>, the pronunciation 'warder' would be different from either of those.  As a simple example, in most varieties of American English, stork is not pronounced the same way as stalk (which is homophones with stock for about half of Americans).  In the Received Pronunciation, stork and stalk are homophones, distinct from stock.  This is because in Received Pronunciation, /r/ is dropped when it does not come before a vowel."
languagelearning,3brrqy,storkstalkstock,3,Thu Jul 2 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the differences are pretty interesting sometimes.   If you look in the Oxford Dictionary site for US English vs British English, in British English stork and stalk are both pronounced: /stɔːk/ and /stɔːk/, vs the American English pronunciation: /stôrk/ and /stôk/"
languagelearning,3brrqy,Moozilbee,2,Thu Jul 2 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"And in a lot of (probably most) American accents, the vowels aren't even the same between the two words.  My stalk/stock vowel is more similar to my stark vowel than to my stork vowel.    Side note: the sucky thing about the Oxford Dictionary pronunciations is that they use the International Phonetic Alphabet for the British version and an American transcription system for the American version.  I wish they just stuck to IPA for both."
languagelearning,3brrqy,storkstalkstock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:56:11 2015 UTC,"The correction is much appreciated, but my English is terrible these days, working in this sort of ""international environments"" really takes a toll in the pronunciation and the work order. For the last two years I heavily simplified my discourse in order to get understood better by those less skilled and now I regret it.  However, I said British, you say English ;-) Obviously, the smaller the territory, the more consistent accents are.  Subjectively, there are British accents that I love, and others that I hate. There are beautiful American accents full of nuances, and nasal ones that take on my nerves. (The same happens in my native language.)  When I read ""British accent"" I tend to think that people actually refer to Received Pronunciation. But then you move away from Southern England and accents are not so close, I remember my first hard experiencies in Manchester after having lived in London (and that's still England). I can't describe it from a regional point of view because I lack the knowledge, but similar rules probably apply to American accents."
languagelearning,3brrqy,palopolo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"I say England because that's what was said in the OP, and you're right, when people say 'British' English you tend to think of English English, in England, rather than, say, Scottish English or Welsh English."

languagelearning,3brrqy,AirOutlaw7,5,Wed Jul 1 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with /u/palopolo and say that saying there's no British or American accent is silly. Of course there are regional variants that can differ wildly, but to say that one English speaker won't sound simply ""American"" or ""British"" or to be from any other Anglophone country is just overly nitpicky to me.  My advice is that if you are going to aim for a particular accent: choose based off of where you live. If you're Mexican, American would be the obvious answer. From Madrid? Definitely go with British.   Or maybe just throw people for a loop and try to get a different foreign accent. Like Russian!"

That having been said and all other things being equal, I would say it would be better to learn the American accent because it is doubtful (any would be very funny indeed) if a speaker learning the ""American"" accent would learn a regional one (like Boston, Southern or Wisconsin English), but would learn a more ""neutral"" version that would be accepted and understood by all Americans. On the other hand, I wouldn't know which U.K. English accent (or if there is a ""neutral"" British accent) to adopt because, AFAIK, some accents carry specific stereotypes (social class, education level, etc.)."

If a non-linguist says a particular language ""phonetic"", like, okay we know that they mean there's a fairly isomorphic relationship between glyphs in the conventionally used orthographic system and phonemes in the spoken language.

Besides, it's also not the last definition.  I skimmed through the wikipedia page you linked, and even there it seems they are using ""phonetic"" by the same definition of language being spelled the way it's pronounced.   To take an example from American English: the /t/ sound in the words ""table"" and ""cat"" would, in a phonemic orthography, be written with the same character; however, a strictly phonetic script would make a distinction between the aspirated ""t"" in ""table"", the flap in ""butter"", the unaspirated ""t"" in ""stop"" and the glottalized ""t"" in ""cat""   I don't see what's so confusing about this definiton of the word."

languagelearning,3bsasn,Semmay,3,Wed Jul 1 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it's pretty straightforward.  First you need to be able to recognize the vowel. In the case of ""빌"" the vowel is ""ㅣ"". The vowel will be preceded by a consonant. The preceding consonant will be either above or to the left of the vowel (depending on the vowel). For the vowel ""ㅣ"", the consonant will always be to the left. So, in this case, the consonant to the left, ""ㅂ"", precedes the vowel. Other consonants follow the vowel, and are written to the bottom. In this case, we have ""ㄹ"" as the last letter in the syllable.  So we read the word ""빌딩"" as ㅂ-ㅣ-ㄹ-ㄷ-ㅣ-ㅇ."

When you have managed to amass gigabytes of language learning resources because it is convenient or freely available, you learn there is little value in hoarding physically. :)  Also, I am of the opinion, as a non-child, you should only ever learn one foreign language in one context at any given time.

In the real world, however, even speaking 5 langauges fully fluently turns out to be extremely rare (though of course, to some extent it depends how you count languages versus dialects, and so on.)

Japanese is only composed of 5 vowel sounds (and paired with consonant sounds), unlike Chinese where there are lots of different tones (going off from what I've heard). Although, Japanese has 'borrowed' Chinese characters, so either way, you'll have to learn some kanji (which can be difficult).  As for usefulness... well, if you want to travel to China or Japan, it'll benefit more if you know that language. Knowing a lot of kanji (whether you took either language) will help as you can probably piece together meanings if/when you travel.  Also keep in mind culture. If you love anime, then Japanese is probably the way to go. But if you really love Chinese pop, then go with Chinese."

I don't know where you're getting this great number from. There's a lot, but it's a tiny amount compared to the number of people and businesses in China.  The way I see it, the biggest problem with learning Chinese is not that it's not useful, but that you'd likely end up working for a Chinese company, which you'd probably rather not do.

languagelearning,3bmfle,madxspence,51,Tue Jun 30 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"It's about as valid as the constant ""untranslatable words"" lists that then go on to translate the words"
languagelearning,3bmfle,ChiangKai-Shrek,5,Tue Jun 30 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"What they mean is that it doesn't have a direct, single word, equivalent, which many monolingual people consider untranslatable. They have this idea that words, especially nouns, always have a corresponding word which can be used in the same connotations and contexts as the word they are familiar with. Even though the word can easily be translated using a few short phrases or sentences, their concept of translation doesn't apply. It's a common misconception."
languagelearning,3bmfle,forest__creature,20,Thu Jul 2 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah... wtf!? How long has ""Chinese"" been a single language..."
languagelearning,3bmfle,PeteDarwin,22,Wed Jul 1 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"It calls it a ""macro language"" to underline the absence of consensus about terminology / the difference to the other listed languages. I see nothing wrong with that."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Brotten,3,Wed Jul 1 11:23:39 2015 UTC,Chinese being one language is about as contested as Montenegrin and Croatian being separate languages: they really aren't but politicians like to pretend they are.
languagelearning,3bmfle,pipocaQuemada,6,Wed Jul 1 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"they still could have separated Mandarin, Cantonese, etc whilst lumping it as a ""macro language"". Dialect or not, the point is that it would have made more sense to anyone who speaks any kind of Chinese to differentiate them. That would have been more useful too because if you somehow sincerely believed they weren't distinct languages, you could still get the data that you wanted.  approach is also inconsistent because it treats Hindi and Urdu as separate languages even though there's no concensus about that either."
languagelearning,3bmfle,guoshe,3,Wed Jul 1 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"Uhm...yeah. They did separate Mandarin, Cantonese etc. while lumping it as a macro language."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Brotten,4,Wed Jul 1 12:39:20 2015 UTC,"it's not visually separated. it's the same blob. unlike eg dialects of Spanish which are delineated into different blobs.   and your point on ""to underline the absence of concensus"" is still weak and unjustified."
languagelearning,3bmfle,guoshe,6,Wed Jul 1 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"The graphic is not delineating Chinese variants, nor is it delineating Spanish variants, the graphic is delineating countries in which languages are spoken."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Brotten,3,Wed Jul 1 14:44:28 2015 UTC,"It is delineating Urdi and Hindi, though."
languagelearning,3bmfle,trua,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems to be based on what the countries themselves name as their national language."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Brotten,0,Wed Jul 1 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"and your point on ""to underline the absence of concensus"" is still weak and unjustified.   But they DO call it a ""macro language"" to underline the absence of concensus."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Anrza,3,Wed Jul 1 14:53:05 2015 UTC,In that case English should have been part of Germanic.
languagelearning,3bmfle,Renzhe,2,Wed Jul 1 18:49:15 2015 UTC,And Spanish and French should be part of Italian.
languagelearning,3bmfle,CykoTom,5,Wed Jul 1 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well it has Malaysian and Indonesian as the same language with Javanese as a separate language. I guess there's less political fall out from that conflation/separation than Chinese."
languagelearning,3bmfle,SlyReference,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:40:28 2015 UTC,I knew something was off when it said the US only had ~200 million English speakers.
languagelearning,3bmfle,Zeklandia,27,Thu Jul 2 00:48:57 2015 UTC,Most spoken first languages
languagelearning,3bmfle,PACDxx,6,Tue Jun 30 12:22:04 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I noticed India was missing from the English speaking list, and it seemed very odd until I realized."
languagelearning,3bmfle,well_golly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:27:52 2015 UTC,But Africa is counted.
languagelearning,3bmfle,TaazaPlaza,3,Wed Jul 1 02:11:20 2015 UTC,Graphing languages in terms of numbers of first speakers is interesting but of course does not tell the entire story. Which of these languages are growing vs shrinking? How widespread are they geographically? What is the economic volume of trade being conducted in these languages?
languagelearning,3bmfle,VinzShandor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:14:12 2015 UTC,This.  Title says most spoken but the graph is most spoken AS A FIRST LANGUAGE.  Despite this sounding trivial it actually makes a big difference.
languagelearning,3bmfle,Chanewt,46,Tue Jun 30 14:21:12 2015 UTC,Did they forget Austria for German?
languagelearning,3bmfle,ZooRevolution,27,Tue Jun 30 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"8,5 Million people in Austria... and we all are voiceless? okayyy :-)"
languagelearning,3bmfle,Mehlwurm,3,Tue Jun 30 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"You think 8,5 million is much? hahaha"
languagelearning,3bmfle,HEOliveira2,5,Wed Jul 1 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"Theyve included a 100,000 Korean-speaking Russian minority, so I would say yes that's a lot lol."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Lagiacrus96,8,Wed Jul 1 20:59:33 2015 UTC,Maybe they went for Standard German but it's still kind of dubious. Switzerland is also only with 0.7 millions on the map. What a joke.
languagelearning,3bmfle,atlas_at,10,Tue Jun 30 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"so what exactly do we speak in austria, please enlighten me :D"
languagelearning,3bmfle,ensleoida,11,Tue Jun 30 15:24:57 2015 UTC,Teitsch :D
languagelearning,3bmfle,thirteenthirtyseven,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"That's why I wrote ""kind of dubious"". For us it's German but apparently not for the author of this map."
languagelearning,3bmfle,atlas_at,5,Tue Jun 30 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"I think that number is the Standard German speakers in Switzerland, excluding Swiss German speakers. Still, weird to include that."
languagelearning,3bmfle,spence5000,3,Tue Jun 30 15:53:00 2015 UTC,Austrians speak a more standard German than those sneaky Swiss.
languagelearning,3bmfle,ScumDogMillionaires,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"Seems they completely left out Dutch, which has some 23 million speakers."
languagelearning,3bmfle,ReinierPersoon,4,Thu Jul 2 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"I would say that there are lots of linguists who consider ""German"" a family of closely related languages. When you look at the Bavarian language and compare it with even standard German you see that the differences are pretty striking."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Henkkles,9,Tue Jun 30 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"...but that chart displays ""Chinese"" as one group, including languages that are less closely related to one another than German languages are."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Xelif,4,Wed Jul 1 00:40:30 2015 UTC,Well isn't that a big derp from them!
languagelearning,3bmfle,Henkkles,6,Wed Jul 1 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"Well, Arabic also varies a lot from place to place but it's still considered as one language according to this picture."
languagelearning,3bmfle,ZooRevolution,5,Tue Jun 30 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes no sense at all. That's like grouping all Romance languages under ""Latin""."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Henkkles,5,Wed Jul 1 07:35:41 2015 UTC,German here refers to Standard German (Hochdeutsch) explicitly. Not to any other part of the German dialect continuum.
languagelearning,3bmfle,adlerchen,2,Wed Jul 1 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess, but how many people in Austria actually speak a lect natively that is even close to Hochdeutsch?"
languagelearning,3bmfle,Henkkles,4,Wed Jul 1 07:36:29 2015 UTC,"According to this chart Salzburg, Graz, and the areas around them have non-negligible amounts of Hochdeutsch native speakers, and Vienna has Hochdeutsch as the main native language of the city (although I don't know where the maker drew the data from)."
languagelearning,3bmfle,adlerchen,3,Wed Jul 1 07:55:33 2015 UTC,"Official language is often quite different from what the people speak, but yes, capitals do tend to attract speakers from all around the lingosphere because Austrians do understand Hoch."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Henkkles,3,Wed Jul 1 10:29:41 2015 UTC,"I would actually assume that more Austrians than Germans speak a lect natively that is even close to Hochdeutsch, since Austria uses Austrian Standard High German as the national standard which is based on their local speech, whereas Germany uses a patchwork consensus as standard, which is not reflecting the local speech of any particular place."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Brotten,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:26:35 2015 UTC,"By that standard you'd have way fewer speakers of German in your map. Even within Germany, dialectal diversity is huge, with some dialects actually mutually unintelligible.  However, by the same token you'd need to split up English, because I want to see a person from lets say Iowa meet someone speaking Mancunian and fully understand them right away.   And lets not forget the languages that got subsumed as ""Chinese"". Those are actually distinct languages that just happen to use the same script."
languagelearning,3bmfle,TanithRosenbaum,37,Wed Jul 1 22:35:17 2015 UTC,"Many Indian languages are missing. Kannada, Oriya ? Did they just forget to include these ? . Whats the point in treating Hindi and Urdu as two languages and combining all Chinese dialects under one category ?"
languagelearning,3bmfle,paramahans,22,Tue Jun 30 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"Also, did you know that Bangladesh is in the middle east? This infographic is hilarious."
languagelearning,3bmfle,feels_good_man,12,Tue Jun 30 18:16:36 2015 UTC,Mexico is also in South America. Not Latin America but South America.
languagelearning,3bmfle,trii0,6,Wed Jul 1 05:02:37 2015 UTC,"Asia Minor decided to not only time travel into the future, but travel to the other side of the continent."
languagelearning,3bmfle,liberaljesus,0,Wed Jul 1 06:01:59 2015 UTC,Mexico is in North America
languagelearning,3bmfle,Raulkg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"Bangladesh is marked as Asia Minor, not Middle East"
languagelearning,3bmfle,mongo_lloyd,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"In the chart for Bengali, the color that Bangladesh seems to have is the same as Middle East, right? I'm not the best with colors though."
languagelearning,3bmfle,feels_good_man,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Ah right, I was looking at the map"
languagelearning,3bmfle,mongo_lloyd,6,Wed Jul 1 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"About the first two points, not enough speakers. The other things you mentioned are inconsistencies though."
languagelearning,3bmfle,TaazaPlaza,2,Tue Jun 30 14:15:11 2015 UTC,Where are any african languages?  Ffs they don't even have swahili on here from what I can see.
languagelearning,3bmfle,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:25:57 2015 UTC,It doesn't have that many speakers iirc.
languagelearning,3bmfle,TaazaPlaza,0,Thu Jul 2 08:18:45 2015 UTC,200 million if you include L2
languagelearning,3bmfle,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, okay. But yeah this is only L1."
languagelearning,3bmfle,TaazaPlaza,-7,Thu Jul 2 08:30:12 2015 UTC,"Because Chinese dialects still share a common written system. Speech and pronunciation are varied, but it was made sure by the government ~100yrs ago that for all intents and purposes, the language is ""standardized"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese"
languagelearning,3bmfle,wu2ad,15,Tue Jun 30 18:40:22 2015 UTC,Languages are spoken; the written system is secondary. Some non-Mandarin Chinese languages have their own vernacular writing systems (i.e. Cantonese).
languagelearning,3bmfle,Xelif,7,Wed Jul 1 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"If you forced France, Italy and Spain to use a common ideographic writing system, would they suddenly just be speaking different dialects of 'Modern Vulgar Latin'?"
languagelearning,3bmfle,pipocaQuemada,7,Wed Jul 1 14:35:58 2015 UTC,"So Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese are all Chinese dialects because 100 years ago they were written in Chinese characters, too?"
languagelearning,3bmfle,SlyReference,0,Wed Jul 1 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"that's obviously different because Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese merely borrowed the writing system. Cantonese, Hokkien, etc belong to the same language family, with similar grammar"
languagelearning,3bmfle,guoshe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:37:02 2015 UTC,"So French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese etc. are all the same language?"
languagelearning,3bmfle,Qichin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:22:48 2015 UTC,"it depends. if you have any shred of knowledge of linguistics, you'd know that the most common criteria used for determining what's a language is probably mutual intelligibility, and eg French and Italian certainly have a lot of that.   The problem is how to set a consistent benchmark of mutual intelligibility to delineate languages and dialects, if even possible.   and poor example btw -- the Romance languages have many cognates between them but usually not the exact same word. Not an ideal comparison."
languagelearning,3bmfle,guoshe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:48 2015 UTC,"I was criticizing the logic of grouping all the Chinese languages into one language while splitting Hindi and Urdu simply based on the supposedly shared writing system of the Chinese languages. Then you made the point that they belong in the same language family, hence my comparison with the Romance languages, who all share a common ancestor and a common writing system.  And I'm aware of both using mutual intelligibility as a criterion, and the many problems associated with using it."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Qichin,21,Thu Jul 2 11:16:10 2015 UTC,So where are the Africans who speak french ?
languagelearning,3bmfle,doinsk,10,Tue Jun 30 17:19:48 2015 UTC,I guess they consider most Francophone Africans not to speak French as their first language - French as the regional lingua franca (literally!) is their second language.
languagelearning,3bmfle,Xelif,3,Wed Jul 1 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, it's wrong for many African countries where french is the official language"
languagelearning,3bmfle,doinsk,9,Wed Jul 1 05:25:55 2015 UTC,"French may be the official language, but it is often not the language spoken at home and is learned later at life - in school or in the community.  So if you take Senegal, for example - while French is the sole official national language (other languages have official recognition as regional languages), only 10% of the population speaks French fluently, and only a small fraction of that 10% speaks French as a first language (i.e. the language learned from birth). Another 21% speaks some French, while a full 69% of the population does not speak French with any level of fluency. Contrast Wolof, the predominant language in Senegal, which is spoken natively or as a second language by 80% of the population.  This situation is replicated in most other Francophone African countries: French is used in administration, educated people are fluent in French, but relatively few people actually have French as a first language; most people speak their local tongue, and another indigenous language is likely preferred as a lingua franca among the general population. Gabon is the only Francophone African country I could find where French has significant penetration as a first language, with perhaps 15-20% of the population learning French from birth."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Xelif,6,Wed Jul 1 05:42:54 2015 UTC,Fair enough but then these 15-20% should have been added to the numbers at least
languagelearning,3bmfle,doinsk,2,Wed Jul 1 05:51:06 2015 UTC,That's far from the only problem with this chart :)
languagelearning,3bmfle,Xelif,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:52:41 2015 UTC,True :P
languagelearning,3bmfle,doinsk,11,Wed Jul 1 05:54:53 2015 UTC,Where's that joke infographic that mocked ones like these? It was made by someone on this sub and I always found it hilarious

languagelearning,3bmfle,polyclod,25,Tue Jun 30 13:06:17 2015 UTC,It's Punjabi. No clue why it's called this. This chart is horrible.  Doesn't include Indian English speakers but African English speakers are counted. African French is not counted. Counts Chinese as one language yet separates Hindi and Urdu. Doesn't count Tajik under Persian. Etc etc.
languagelearning,3bmfle,TaazaPlaza,6,Tue Jun 30 14:07:15 2015 UTC,'Malay/bahasa' looks weird because 'bahasa' literally means language.
languagelearning,3bmfle,ginger_beer_m,3,Tue Jun 30 14:10:38 2015 UTC,Bhasha means language also in Sanskrit.

languagelearning,3bmfle,marmulak,6,Tue Jun 30 15:52:33 2015 UTC,this is old. U.S. has more spanish speakers than Spain.
languagelearning,3bmfle,bellbutt,5,Tue Jun 30 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty interesting that they included Persian speakers in Pakistan where it is only spoken by Afghan refugees and possibly people near the Afghan border, but they excluded the entire nation of Tajikistan! The Tajik dialect of Persian is the official language of Tajikistan. They also forgot Tajik is spoken in Bukhara and Samarkand by Tajiks in Uzbekistan.    And they forgot Russian is spoken in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikstan!  And all their figures are terrible!"
languagelearning,3bmfle,thebabscrazyfangirl,4,Tue Jun 30 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Considering the amount of different language dialects of Chinese, I feel like this infograph is inaccurate and miss informing. ""Chinese"" is not even really considered a language since there are many different forms such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese and Taiwanese."
languagelearning,3bmfle,Perung,4,Tue Jun 30 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland#Languages  65%/73% of Swiss people speak German as their mother tongue,      23% speak french as their mother tongue.  Map says 700k German/1900k French  I call bullshit  Also: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Sprache#Deutsch_als_Muttersprache 90 - 105 million native speakers, according to Wikipedia"
languagelearning,3bmfle,HansWurst1099,2,Tue Jun 30 15:41:18 2015 UTC,But the Swiss learn Hochdeutsch in school as a foreign language. What the German Swiss speak at home is the local Schwiitzerdütsch.

languagelearning,3bmfle,HansWurst1099,2,Wed Jul 1 09:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that. Are you saying that the Alemanic varieties (and yes, there is not just one dialect) natively spoken in Switzerland should be counted under ""German"" in the tally? Because if that's what you're saying then you might as well include Dutch as well, because it's also quite unintelligible from Hochdeutsch."
languagelearning,3bmfle,adlerchen,2,Wed Jul 1 09:30:31 2015 UTC,"They use the same grammar and mostly the same word order, as far as i can remember and you can understand them pretty good as a German if you listen carefully, they just use a partially different vocabulary.   Also Schwiizertüütsch is classified as a german dialect by Wikipedia. For Schwiizertüütsch to be not a German dialect, in my opinion it should be more different in grammar and such. Sorry for my bad explanation but i thought about it for 10 minutes, and i can't seem to find a better explanation in my head.   But I think if you want to count Schwiizertüütsch as its own language, you'd have to say that Bairisch is its own language, too."

It'd be horribly blurry divided, and the only extra information communicated would be the amount of speakers per country per Chinese language, which I don't feel like it's worth cluttering up the image for.

I personally wouldn't waste my time taking a less interesting language just because rate my professor said so. I said in another thread that learning is interactive. If you bring your passion to the classroom you will get something out of it whether the teacher is Socrates or not.   Having said that, if there are a series of classes that you have to take with just one professor that IS problematic because if you find you and the professor lock horns you have to deal with that same professor for several courses. That's usually not a good situation to be in. Take the first course and see what YOUR experience is. Worst case scenario is you learn more about a language in one semester than you knew before. If the prof is a dick, you never have to see him again.   Edit:  Also, there's a real beauty to reading texts in their original language that translations very rarely match in my experience. Even if you make some preliminary steps toward literacy in Turkish that sounds like your time would have been well spent."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,Pacienca,2,Wed Jul 1 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There are plenty of excellent teachers who, because they are tough and/ or don't view themselves as 'entertainers' get low ratings."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,feedmefeces,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:12:36 2015 UTC,Yea I was going to come in and say that about teaching review sites. I've had professors with awful reviews be perfectly fine and professors with awesome reviews turn out to be not that great.  I would sign up for the course and see how the professor is and if you can tell in the first few classes that you will not like them then just switch to another language.
languagelearning,3bpb2k,araradia,2,Wed Jul 1 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"I will caution though, teachers really DO matter- my first semester of college Russian, my professor was a man who spoke it fluently, but was american- he was amazing. Spoke in Russian 90% of the time from day one, and I learned so much. When I took German my senior year, I learned nothing. She was from Germany but relied heavily on English."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,B_Hutt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"i'd avoid the professor. what could happen is that he/she is so bad as to actually turn you off to the idea of learning turkish. if you don't mind that, then go for it.  otherwise, could you take a language whose speakers share a similar culture to turkey's?"
languagelearning,3bpb2k,sillygoose111,3,Wed Jul 1 02:04:58 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I don't understand how one teacher at the college level can turn someone away from an interest that they had before even getting to college? I can see if a freshman had no exposure, then took a class with some random douche. Yeah, I can see that being a turn off because the experience of the language and the experience with the teacher are linked. However, I think adults who have a passion for a language should be able to uncouple those things. If you know you want to learn Turkish before even getting to school, then one course should not dissuade you. I HATE  my college textbook. It's a hot ass mess. Many people also dislike my instructor. It doesn't diminish my passion for the language. I supplement my sources and find other opportunities to work with my language. Part of growing up I think is learning how to problem solve. Very few situations are ideal. I wish every instructor was excellent. They just won't always be. I wish all my classmates gave a damn- they don't. We work with what we have."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,Pacienca,3,Wed Jul 1 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"when people ask things like this on the forums i frequent, i generally assume that they're beginners or even just people who thought the idea of learning a second language was cool. maybe op could be dissuaded, maybe not. it happened to me with german twice and to some of my former french classmates. but with a language with as many obstacles as turkish, i'm assuming that this situation would be more delicate than french or german. especially if it's the ops first ""real"" language learning experience. if he made a thread about it, i would guess that he had some doubt in his mind. but like i said, if he doesn't mind taking the risk on the bad professor and just wants exposure to the language, then go for it. the most important thing is doing what feels right to you and not getting discouraged."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,sillygoose111,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I can see where previous experience could weigh heavily in a decision with someone very new to learning an L2. I agree it's a very individual choice...but we don't know for sure the professor is bad. We only know what a bunch of strangers on a website's opinion of that professor is. We don't know what the students did or did not bring to that experience. That is also something only OP can determine for himself, and you are right it is a risk. Is it worth it to you OP?  That's something only the OP can answer really."
languagelearning,3bpb2k,Pacienca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"It's not even much of a risk. Even if the teacher really isn't so great, he can still approach the class dilegently and use it as an opportunity to learn a ton."

languagelearning,3bo2e8,adrianslont,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"I don't quite agree with Chinese being the 2nd. It's mostly spoken by the Chinese with one another. You'll less likely find someone who acquired it as a 2nd language unless you are talking about places like Singapore which have many nations in one state. But statistically speaking, Chinese is spoken a lot. because there are a lot of Chinese.  Asia is a big place with cultures too diverse from one another. I'm Filipino and probably a way I can connect with Chinese or Japanese or whatever is if they knew English."
languagelearning,3bo2e8,enisme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's not quite the same as a French person speaking English to a German person because in that case English is the native language of neither. However Chinese languages are still important Lingua Francas in Asia. Indonesian maids working in Hong Kong often learn basic Cantonese for one example. Also, many Indonesian Chinese people travelling in Singapore or Malaysia will use a Chinese language. Or Chinese speaking tourists travelling in Vietnam might speak a Chinese language to one of the seven million Chinese speaking Vietnamese. They may be ethnically Chinese but they are not Chinese nationals. It doesn't matter. They are still using Chinese as a Lingua Franca. Is a Chinese speaking Filipino a Filipina? What would you suggest might be the number two Lingua Franca in Asia?"
languagelearning,3bo2e8,adrianslont,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:13:17 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about statistics, then yes, Chinese would be a number two in terms of number of speakers, maybe. But that's counting all the Chineses as a whole. There are so many dialects and that is problematic if you are talking of a language used by a good number of Asians.  The problem is just that Asia is way too diverse. If you are talking about the usefuness of Chinese, it wouldn't be as useful in the Philippines unless you are talking to the Chinese themselves. Or you want to engage in business with Chinese. Or in West Asia. Or probably the -stans. Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia are all in Southeast Asia and are very near each other. The Philippines is in SEA too but still, very different culturally and is farther. English seems to be more accessible to most countries (if they aren't then the more common case would be a government deliberately avoiding it for whatever reason). Chinese doesn't seem to have the same effect as English. So I don't think there's another lingua Franca.  Filipina is just a female Filipino haha. Tsinay or Chinita is what we call females with Chinese blood. I don't recall us having a word for Chinese-speaking Filipinos though."

languagelearning,3boa7g,Rjdubs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"I did it last year, during the Summer (I did A2).  The course has the lessons that you really have to do, and there is a tutor that sends you homework every time you finish a lesson and you can also ask him stuff. There is also a bunch of other exercises (that as far as I understood are the same for all levels), and from those ones I did almost none. In the beginning I thought the lessons would appear in order (eg. the 2nd lesson would only appear after I finished the 1st) but that doesn't happen. You can access all the material in the course at any time. There is also the software that analyzes your pronunciation. Before the course, I was quite apprehensive about that part, but in fact I thought it works really well!  In the end of the course I started a B1.1 course in the Goethe Institut in my city, and I didn't feel I was less prepared than the other people in my class at all.

languagelearning,3bomu6,Ishify,2,Tue Jun 30 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"It's a question of if you are doing or if something is being done to you. Du is nominative which makes the whole sentence about you and what you are up to.  Dich is accusative, which makes you the thing being acted on by the verb. Ich and mich (I and me) are the same.  Ich finde dich. Du findest mich. It's a question of who's finding who. Because the words are different, you can muck about with the order, so ""ich finde dich"" and ""dich finde ich"" mean the same thing, just with a shade of emphasis on the word used first.  In English we only have one you. At first blush it makes things simpler, but it does open the door to more ambiguity."
languagelearning,3bomu6,tea-drinker,2,Tue Jun 30 22:10:07 2015 UTC,I find you and you were found by I?   Does this mean there are some sentences that I can switch around as long as I use the right word? What about ihr?
languagelearning,3bomu6,tea-drinker,2,Tue Jun 30 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"I find you   Yep.   You were found by I   Not quite. That's the passive voice and swaps the ""you"" into the nominative. ""Du würdest bei mir gefunden."" is the translation and uses the nominative Du.  Rather think of some twist in a detective movie. ""After all the false leads and shell companies I get to the kingpin and I find you."" Who is being found is more important in the sentence than who was doing the finding. But you can't switch that around in English because the two uses of 'you' are the same word.  But yes. Swap word order away, it'll usually still make sense if it would have made sense the 'right' way around, but the unusual order will be noted and meaning will be read into it.  Ihr appears on this list of german pronouns as singular feminine third person dative and plural second person nominative.  I'm sure those descriptions didn't help.  Ihr does double duty. It works just like Du expect it implies there are a lot of 'you'. It also works like 'her' if 'she' is the source, destination or location of the object.  You give her gold. Du gibst ihr Gold. You are doing the giving. The gold is being given. She is the one getting the gold so she needs to be dative. Similar to different words for each different you, there are different words for her when you tease her and her when you give her cake."
languagelearning,3bomu6,Qichin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"In English, we might use the slightly weird sounding ""You I find"" to place emphasis on the object. Not the same word order as in German, but kind of the same effect."
languagelearning,3bomu6,Flemz,2,Wed Jul 1 10:17:22 2015 UTC,"In German there are four grammatical cases. These let you know if a word is the subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. English has these as well, though only in pronouns (I-me-my, he-him-his, she-her-her). The changing of nouns to fit their case is called declension. The cases are used as follows:  The nominative case is for subjects, predicate nominatives, and predicate adjectives. It is also the case in which all words are displayed in a dictionary. Ex: Ich, Du, etc.  The accusative case is for the direct objects of most verbs and the objects of prepositions that don't involve movement. Ex: Mich, Dich, etc.  The dative case is for indirect objects as well as the direct objects of certain verbs such as hilfen and is also used for the objects of prepositions that involve movement. Ex: Mir, Dir, etc.  Finally, the genitive case is for possessives and the objects of prepositions which, in English, have the word of, such as because of or instead of. Ex: Mein, Dein, etc.  I'll lay out the declensions of the personal pronouns in the order of nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive:  I: ich, mich, mir, mein  You (informal singular): du, dich, dir, dein  You (formal singular and plural) Sie, Sie, Ihnen, Ihr (note that all formal pronouns are always capitalized  He: er, ihn, ihm, sein  She: sie, sie, ihr, ihr   It: es, es, ihm, sein  We: wir, uns, uns, unser  You (informal plural): ihr, euch, euch, euer  They: sie, sie, ihnen, ihr (though these are the same pronouns as formal You, they are not capitalized if they are not the first word of a sentence)  However, unlike English, German declension isn't exclusive to pronouns. All nouns can be declined, and they all have their specific articles (a, an, the, in English) and endings to add to them to show their cases.  I'll begin with the definite articles (the, in English) for masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural words, whose cases will be shown in the same order as above.  Declension of the word the for masculine words are as follows: der, den, dem, des  The for feminine words is as follows: die, die, der, der  The for neuter words is as follows: das, das, dem, des  For plural, it's die, die, der, der  Now the indefinite articles (A or an in English):  For masculine words: ein, einen, einem, eines  Feminine: eine, eine, einer, einer  Neuter: ein, ein, einem, eines  Some words also need certain endings to show their case:  Some masculine and neuter words add -s or -es to the end in the genitive. Der Mann -> Des Mannes, Das Pferd -> Des Pferdes  Many plural words add -n or -en in the dative. Die Leute -> Der Leuten  That's about it, there are still some adjective endings to learn, but I've typed all this out on my phone so far, so I'll direct you to www.german.about.com which has all you'd ever need to know about German grammar.

languagelearning,3bomu6,zaganta,2,Tue Jun 30 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"In English we have something similar with ""he"" and ""him."" You see him. He sees you. It's all about who's doing the action and who's getting it done to them.   Think about I and me, they and them, she and her. Same deal. we totally have this same thing with some of our English pronouns, but in German there is even more of this fun. The German words for ""the"" also change to indicate whether the noun is doing something or getting something done to it."
