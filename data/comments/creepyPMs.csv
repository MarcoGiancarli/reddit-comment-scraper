creepyPMs,3e295c,ThundercocksHOOO,51,Tue Jul 21 12:00:48 2015 UTC,i still cannot understand why they always tell people to fuck off when theyre the ones intruding and making you uncomfortable...
creepyPMs,3e295c,kwonniebunz,12,Tue Jul 21 12:33:12 2015 UTC,It's like they think they're entitled to have any woman just watch them masturbate and send them pictures at a moment's notice.

""Okay, have a nice day then"" suggests disappointment, which is a perfectly acceptable reaction to rejection, but not anger or aggression, which are not. Yes, they would still be asking women they barely know who have expressed no interest in those things to gratify them sexually, but at least the aren't acting like those women exist for no other purpose than to gratify them and getting angry when they don't."

creepyPMs,3dyepc,Xnfbqnav,37,Mon Jul 20 20:44:48 2015 UTC,"You think that, and everyone thinks that, and the thing is, it's wrong. Sure, you get to masturbate on camera for a couple dozen people and get paid for it. But you also need to be an actor, because when that creepy guy starts talking to you because he paid money to do so, and he's not technically breaking any rules but he's still going on about how much he'd love to have sex with you? You need to smile and say ok. And that gets to you, because creepy guys are your biggest consumer base when you do camwork. And they show up over and over and over and over. And every time you just gotta smile and say ok."

creepyPMs,3dyepc,wizardcats,4,Mon Jul 20 23:04:27 2015 UTC,It's definitely a fetish.   I was bored one night on the interwebs and found a website that had chat rooms. It was like old school AOL basically.   You could IM other people and connect to webcams.   I logged in as something like guest118745 and got like 20 IM's from guys asking if I was a girl and if I was did I want to watch them jack off on cam. I didn't even need my own cam.

creepyPMs,3e0cjo,AnaxareteInLove,10,Tue Jul 21 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"This is actually what it is, in most cases. As a submissive female, I have encountered a lot of men who were more than happy to hear that I enjoy being submissive... because that means I will give them blowjobs whenever they feel like it and they will never have to put in any effort. Because being submissive means you think orgasms are overrated and men should be given a break! RIGHT!?  I have to add that not everyone who claims being into BDSM is like that. There's a lot of people who identify as dominant who want all parties involved to have fun, not just them. But some ""doms"" I have encountered are just too lazy to be creative or put in any effort, so they think it's all about telling you what to do and when you want something more out of it, they roll their eyes and tell you that you are the submissive so you don't get any favours and that's the end of it."

creepyPMs,3dwx26,pandarknave,25,Mon Jul 20 08:53:37 2015 UTC,Solo traveling tends to be very social actually. You set out alone and show up to most cities/towns alone but you end up meeting and going out with a ton of new people all the time. Most of the stories you pick up involve all the different people you've met in some form or another. The guy's an asshole but most likely he's jealous that their meeting so many people and he's alone in his room because he won't talk to anyone.
