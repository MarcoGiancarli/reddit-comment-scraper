ColoradoSprings,3e3sb0,dinglemelonski,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"It's a city of half-a-million people, so yeah, lots of restaurants.  Since you have experience you ought to be fine.    $800 is a good amount for housing, you'll be able to find cheaper certainly.  But also realize that, as cost of living is lower, so too are wages (not hugely, but true to a certain degree).  Manitou is an amazing town, but living there isn't for everyone.  It's eclectic, with lots of long-time residents who are mostly old hippies living in fairly pricy houses, mixed with lots of young, transient folks living in very cheap housing.  But it does have a high concentration restaurants, including a good number of nicer places like you're looking for.    If the mountains are your draw, try to live on the westside.  The vast majority of the outdoorsy stuff is on the westside.  Colorado Springs is pretty sprawled, and east-west travel is especially hard because the city doesn't have great east-west thoroughfares."

I don't know of any that are much closer.  Craigslist is probably the predominant medium for finding housing around here, unless you go straight to an apartment complex's website. A lot of good places show up on craigslist (some bad too), but the prices have been high lately IMO. Also try the griffis blessing apartment properties. Their prices are a little high but from what I hear they do property management better than most. http://www.gbrents.com/communities/colorado-springs/overview.html  Good luck and welcome!"
ColoradoSprings,3e3sb0,OfficerNelson,3,Tue Jul 21 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"I would avoid Craigslist beyond a last resort or for odd circumstances (<$500/mo, for example). OP seems to be in good shape to find a place at those numbers. Sites like ApartmentRatings are probably a better starting point, and Yelp is good for double-checking ratings.  Be careful though, OP - if it's too good to be true, it probably is. I moved into a complex with >90% recommended, and within two years it's nosedived to 65% and getting worse by the day. I suspect some rating inflation was the culprit there considering everyone and their mom was posting positive reviews at the time."

ColoradoSprings,3dzrdl,jngreenlee,9,Mon Jul 20 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"Portland reports 4000 homeless on their streets in a night.  CS reports 1300..  The total number of homeless in Portland is three times the total number of homeless in CS.  The population of Portland is 600k.  CS is 440k.  The total population of Portland is not three times CS, or even twice.  So, while you may look around and feel like there's more homeless here, the rate of homelessness is significantly higher in Portland than it is here.  Chances are likely your daily living in Portland probably just skipped over the homeless areas, and maybe it doesn't in CS.    That said, the rate of homelessness in Portland for a city of its size really is quite low.  This is frequently attributed to the fact that Oregon has some of the best mental health access in the nation.  (CS is low because it's not a major city, most of the homeless in CS end up in Denver).  Finally, it's important to realize the visible homeless generally account a tiny percentage of the total homeless.  Maybe in Portland more families are homeless (generally unnoticed) and CS has more stinky chronically homeless folks."

Appreciated!"
ColoradoSprings,3dzrdl,adamXYL,5,Mon Jul 20 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"There are a couple factors, but pot isn't one of them.  Until recently we didn't have a no camping ordinance in the city. In 2013 an ordinance was issued but the city didn't want to criminalize homelessness so the Homeless Outreach Team (dubbed the HOT cops) was formed. They are still operating. The HOT Cops work with homeless people on an individual level helping them find family, support and job opportunities in our community as well as nationwide. Travel expenses are paid as long as a real opportunity or support network is present. This program was spawned because Boulder CO passed a no camping ordinance 3 or 4 months before us and they rounded up all their homeless on a bus and shipped them to The Springs and left them.  Combine our compassionate response to homelessness and our city's refusal to add any new tax for any reason and you have a pretty good but under funded out reach program. I don't think we have more than a city our size, but we also don't have a ""bad-part-of-town"" and everyone is always outside and on trails so I think you just notice that part of our population more."

We also shipped them off a few years back and they came back anyway.  Those moving here for pot tend to be a much younger underemployed crowd, not unemployed just not prepared for the cost of living here, thinking Colorado is more like Wyoming or Nebraska. Those asking for money in Manitou either have struggling parents, are struggling younger adults or just want to get high and not pay for it themselves.

ColoradoSprings,3dvfye,GBFel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:27:03 2015 UTC,"Look in the neighborhoods along Fountain Mesa Road.  North of Mesa Ridge Pkwy is generally older and thus cheaper, whereas south consists of mostly newer houses (until you get a couple miles south of the Lowes).  Pretty much all of those will have decent space with good size yards.  Note that a couple of neighborhoods have HOAs in the area and for my money I'd avoid the drama.  The closer you get to Highway 85/87, the older the homes and thus you start to find more sketch.    If you're looking to be a bit farther afield, East of the Widefield area there are some more rural areas with sporadic PUD areas, most of which still have HOAs.  You can also find some rural areas to the South and East of Fountain.  The intersection area of Fountain Mesa and Mesa Ridge has a ton of fast food, some banks, a Denny's, a Safeway, and a Lowes.  If you go up 85/87 you will find a WalMart, more food, and a bunch of strip mall type things.  From down South you can easily hop on the Interstate to head into downtown COS or up into the hills/Manitou/Woodland Park.  Or, you can just as easily take Powers or Mark Sheffel up the East side of COS to hit up the newer retail areas along Powers or the minor league baseball field.  Travelling East-West in the Springs can be difficult, so the ability to shoot right up to where you want is a cool perk of living down South.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

I think Pho-Nominal serves great food. The only issue is that they seem to have hired waiters who have no idea about pho. I phoned in an order for a medium bowl of Pho Tai. Seems straightforward, right? The young girl on the phone had to ask me what goes in that. Seriously? I feel like they hired young college folks to make their customers feel comfortable, versus the awkward situation of voicing your order to someone who can barely understand you and vice versa. But at least teach these young guns the basics of your menu before you let them answer the phone. I mean really...  Still the food is superb."

ColoradoSprings,3dt6cq,answerguru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:30 2015 UTC,I think it depends on where you live. I have Verizon and recently moved to the Briargate area. I have no service. Just ask the people in your area. We've heard Sprint has best coverage in this area from our neighbors.
ColoradoSprings,3dt6cq,flancock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:13 2015 UTC,Sprint has a large amount of LTE towers here. Pretty much anywhere you go you have signal. Now when you start going out east on 94 signal gets a little funky. You will switch between a lot larger of number of cell towers from 4G LTE to 1x or when you get out to Pikes Peak Gun Club when you walk from one side of the club house to the other you switch between a tower with LTE and then go over a tower that is Extended 1x without any data. But if you stay in town you get exceptional service.

I do not understand how this could be successful for advertisers due to the low visibility and comparatively low traffic for this sub. Reach/freq would be very difficult to accomplish with this approach.   Now if Reddit could serve up impressions on all their subs, and deliver those geographically (so people in new York see new York ads, Colorado springers see springs ads etc), that would be something to talk about. But of all the time I spend on Reddit, less than 1 percent of it has to do with this sub, and I haven't visited this sub specifically to see content for a long time.   Edit: a word"
ColoradoSprings,3drr9j,better-off-ted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"This sub receives an average of ~35,000 page views per month. With more than 10,000 unique visitors each month. It's not huge, but it's not small either. I placed a Facebook ad for my photography one month and only received 400 views. Posting here would be substantially more traffic for a much lower cost."
ColoradoSprings,3drr9j,better-off-ted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that some traffic is better than no traffic. But to put it in perspective, I managed local sales for one of the major network affiliates in town. Their website received about 100k hits daily, and 300-500k uniques monthly. And display advertising was still a challenge, because people weren't going to the site, then drilling down to the articles they want to read. They were getting those links from news aggregators and social platforms. You have a similar challenge. I read a lot of the springs sub articles, but I don't go to the sub specifically and look for content. My concern is that something like a sticky post wouldn't be seen as much as you think. I may be wrong but as a marketer that would be my concern."
ColoradoSprings,3drr9j,CamaroM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:49:35 2015 UTC,"Last month the stickied posts were seen by precisely 10,582 unique viewers a total of 40,836 times.   We actually don't have any challenge because this isn't meant to be used for advertising or revenue generation. This is meant to be a community for discussing all things related to Colorado Springs. It's driven by generous content contributors and volunteers like myself who attempt to reasonably moderate the content and discussions. If the number of views suddenly dropped to 2 per month I wouldn't lose a moment of sleep. When I started moderating this community nearly 4 years ago we had less than 2,000 pageviews per month and we were just as happy as we are today. What we have now are growing pains."

I took a free class at each one and ended up going with Continuum.   They aren't the only gyms in town, but they are equidistant from my house.   The reason I chose Continuum over 719 was because of a poor experience at 719. I was dead set on joining 719 and was going to sign up the day of my free class, but one of their members rubbed me the wrong way. In addition to that I felt their gym catered to the more elite folks and less to beginners. The coaches expected everyone in the class to do HSPUs. I had never done one, but they insisted I do it until I nearly broke my neck. Same for a couple other beginners in the class.  The experience that I got at Continuum was more beginner friendly, despite the fact that they had a lot of very skilled athletes there. I felt welcome, despite my inexperience.

ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,swiggity_,-2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:36 2015 UTC,Exactly! Go do some upvoting!
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,3,Sat Jul 18 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"I like to see local happenings and fun stuff to do. I really dont want to see ads for other things but if they show up, I skip them."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,5,Sat Jul 18 16:29:55 2015 UTC,What if we create a weekly or monthly stickied post for local advertising?  Everyone would be free to post about their business or meetup opportunities as long as they are local. No national chains or online events. Any advertising posted outside of that thread could be considered spam.  This would allow the more popular events to rise to the top by democratic vote and give everyone a central location for things to do.    I've also reached out to the mods of /r/Denver to see if the way they handle events would work for us.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,PoopyToes,3,Sat Jul 18 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I vote for this idea."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good idea and hopefully something that the sub could all come together on. If you are interested in local events/happenings, then you don't have to open the thread. I for one personally hate seeing the moving to or visiting posts… I rarely even notice the business ones they fall so fast."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,Solendor,7,Sat Jul 18 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"The people who got angry with my post about Frankie's actually took the time to call my work to tell them about it. I believe they said they were ""mediators"" not moderators, I asked for clarification on that. Thank you for this post. I wasn't trying to piss anyone off I was just letting people know what was going on for whatever evening I posted on. I thought this sub was meant for these types of things. I'm not an owner, I'm just a girl trying to get the word out on our bar and make a living for my family."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,klingpop,8,Sat Jul 18 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely did not call your business and am so sorry someone did that.  That's petty and childish.  But I do I think you're redditing inappropriately.  Or were -- your defense against this has actually led to a more normalized reddit account.  When I first complained 100% of your posts to this community were in promotion of your business, and now maybe 60% are.   That's a huge improvement.    Reddit first, promote second.  That's all I ask, that's all reddit asks.  And I'm so sorry I said anything about you or your bar was shitty, that was shitty of me.  I edited my earlier comment."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,5,Mon Jul 20 01:59:12 2015 UTC,It was not a mod who made that call. We wouldn't bother with something like that. I can easily ban a spammer without having to make any phone calls.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:31 2015 UTC,It was obviously one of the three idiots on her original post. None of whom have chimed in yet on this one.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,8,Sat Jul 18 15:38:27 2015 UTC,ER is also not posted by the owner or anyone associated with the business. It was started by myself and ER is kind enough to let us play there
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,klingpop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"Or maybe we just don't let businesses advertise at all, redditors or not. Keep that shit on TV."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,PoopyToes,2,Sat Jul 18 18:52:30 2015 UTC,That is an option and that's why we are having this discussion
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:03 2015 UTC,I post on Friday and Saturdays only when we have events happening. And I occasionally had a Sunday brunch in there.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,-5,Sat Jul 18 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"So had she worded it as a ""reddit trivia meetup"" that wouldve been okay huh? Both are businesses trying to get people in the door. You and your two loser pals from the other thread are outvoted about 18-3 at this point anyways sooooo adios!😁"
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,PoopyToes,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:30:48 2015 UTC,Because to see 3 dudes straight up attack someone for promoting a weekly event and call her work?!? In my opinion is borderline harassment and weak.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,klingpop,2,Sat Jul 18 16:39:33 2015 UTC,I'm very seriously considering banning them because of the harassment. It's a clear violation of Reddit rules.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,5,Sat Jul 18 16:43:14 2015 UTC,"I've read every post in this thread, and I'm the only one who admitted to calling. So where are you getting ""Two people have already admitted to the calls.""?   Ban me, if you'd like. Calling the manager of a business to let them know about the actions of an employee acting on their behalf isn't harassment. If she were placing flyers on random windshields, it would be an appropriate form of feedback to call the business and tell them their marketing scheme is annoying. Or complaining about a delivery driver being rude on the road. If you represent your employer in public, and you do things people don't like on their behalf...expect your workplace to hear about it.   That's not doxxing. That's not harassment. It's the consequence for making yourself the public face of your employer."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,klingpop,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"For now I'm ignoring the reports against you, but I have no influence over the decisions of the admins."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,4,Sun Jul 19 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"You have no idea who called them. I didn't, I said my piece on here.  Put the banhammer down; the only person you know clearly violated Reddit rules is /u/GrnEyedGinger12  You're supposed to buy advertising (posts at the top of selected subs, quite cheap for a small sub like this) if you want to promote a business on a single account at the rate they did."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,2,Mon Jul 20 12:09:23 2015 UTC,"Two people have already admitted to the calls. That is real world harassment. I have chosen not to ban them from this sub in the hopes that they will see the error of their ways and change their behavior.  /u/GrnEyedGinger12 was clearly following the lead of the other places doing the same thing - Enchanted Realms, Sunbird, Barnes & Noble, Cleats, Brewers Republic, McCabes, Jack Quinn's, Tony's, and Green Man have all had free advertising on our sub by people soliciting for members to join them at these locations.  Unfortunately these types of posts will now be considered spam unless they are in the weekly local events thread. That solution should amicably resolve this to everyone's satisfaction."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,Solendor,0,Mon Jul 20 19:11:53 2015 UTC,Great idea. They crossed the line hands down.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"A PUBLIC FORUM where anyone can post whatever they want?!? And if she got preferential treatment like ER and was able to sticky her posts, the repetitive posts wouldnt be needed would they? And yes a white muscular knight seeking to bring the masses to that which they call Frankies! You figured me out! Im actually a cook there named Juan, you should call my boss and snitch on me for making too many reddit posts."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,PoopyToes,3,Mon Jul 20 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"But Juan, you're a great redditor.  You asked about cleats, climbing partners, drinking and hangovers, your wife's crazy boss...you've got a wide and varied posting history.    You?  You keep doing what you do, including promoting the fuck out of Frankies.  Because I know that won't be all you do."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,GrnEyedGinger12,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:48:25 2015 UTC,WHOA. We've got an internet baddass here. Better be careful!
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,CamaroM,-6,Sat Jul 18 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah Matt, be careful😉"
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,-5,Sat Jul 18 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"Actually it was me, fuckface. I called and spoke to her boss, Pam. Real sweet lady. Didn't have a fucking clue what I was talking about. I had to explain everything to her. I thought it was hilarious. People are getting annoyed with her shit. I thought it would be better to give her, an innocent bar manager, a warning before people leave bad reviews because of one employee."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,rich8n,5,Mon Jul 20 03:01:11 2015 UTC,"This is a discussion. Name calling isn't necessary.  We need solutions, not more animosity."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,klingpop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:37 2015 UTC,She had no idea what you were talking about and quite honestly didn't see what the big deal was if it's a public forum to announce events in Colorado Springs. Explain to me how Enchanted Realms gets to post special? Do they pay some fee? Is it a moderator's post? Is it because they say it's a reddit meet up? I guess I'm just a little confused.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,jktaylor2,5,Sat Jul 18 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Early on the Enchanted Realms meetup was the only meetup posted and I agreed, as a moderator, to sticky it in the interest of bringing the community together. There is no remuneration for me keeping it at the top. In fact I've never been there or met the people who post it. Now that there are more opportunities (including yours) being posted we need to have this discussion and decide how we want to proceed."
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,CamaroM,0,Sat Jul 18 18:20:59 2015 UTC,Thank you. I appreciate the explanation.
ColoradoSprings,3dp9fd,TurksonCO,8,Sat Jul 18 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"It's not Enchanted Realms making the post - it is a group of gamers who HAPPEN to meetup at ER. ER is in no way promoting the game night on Reddit.   Take a step back and look at it from this angle - a group of redditors (started by me) wanted to meetup and play some board games. We searched around and found ER to be a nice spot. This was 2 years ago. We still want to invite more people to play with us, so we go back to our roots and post the meetup reminder on Reddit every week. The mods, seeing this meetup was happening ALL the time, decided to pin it to the top. That's it"

ColoradoSprings,3dnaie,RomanVargas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:46 2015 UTC,"Hey mods, apparently quietly removing posts doesn't change this spammer's behavior in the slightest.  Maybe this time you could also mention that she needs to stop spamming this sub.  Admittedly, she's now made one whole post and one whole comment to /r/coloradosprings that wasn't just shilling her bar.  So now only 96% of the crap she posts to this sub has been self-promotion."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,kckguitar,24,Thu Jul 16 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"In general, people seem to mind their own business. Conservative or liberal, religious or not, there seems to be a general consensus on a ""you do you, I do me"" philosophy, at least in my experience. I also have a particular perspective, though, given that I'm a college teacher, so my colleagues are also generally on the left end of the spectrum. I try to avoid even letting my students know what my personal views are, but of course, topics come up, and even the very outspoken ones don't seem altogether resistant to hearing out opposing views."

ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,Budded,9,Fri Jul 17 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"The Evangelical presence in this town is largely on paper, due to the presence of key organizations like Focus on the Family, Cook Communications, New Life, and others. The people themselves are relatively toothless when it comes to proselytizing. Worst I ever had was Creationist classmates whining about Evolution and the Big Bang like they actually knew what they were talking about."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,Mikesapien,6,Fri Jul 17 07:39:35 2015 UTC,"Don't be a dick and nobody will care.  Been here 10 years and only ever once been straight asked what church I go to. Hell, I've ended up asking people personal religion questions more than people ask me (some baby-sitters are very religious and incorporate it into the baby-sitting. The wife and I don't want that pushed on our child).  It just comes down to being respectful. The way you treat others will impact how others treat you. You think it'd be common sense, but so many people can't seem to wrap their head around that basic concept."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,TheMrNick,3,Fri Jul 17 13:54:04 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. I live practically  next door to a church and the most annoying thing I've had is occasional flyers left on my door for events. most of the 20-30ish year old folks I've met are either non relgious or not jerks about it at least. A few military people I've met have been a bit more forward with their relgious/conservative  views, but none have been openly awful to our face when they find out we are liberal, godless heathens."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,Khaotic1987,4,Fri Jul 17 03:40:22 2015 UTC,"The Springs get a bad rap because the conservatives are loud.  Truth be told, it's a blast for young liberals if you live downtown and ignore the constant refrain of ""the springs sucks"". Having grown up in the art/music scene, lots of people leave to bigger, cooler cities and come back because the city is actually pretty fun. As someone who's spent seven years living in those bigger, cooler cities, I'd move back in a heart beat.  Just enjoy it."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,kepleronlyknows,18,Fri Jul 17 07:27:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly like it is for anyone else. You deal with outspoken Christians (although far fewer with the 'conversion' or 'persecution' mindset than in the Midwest), dippy hippies, a few outspoken aetheists, etc. Overall (and I can only compare to my experiences growing up in the Midwest where the majority are conservative Christians), people here are very friendly and welcoming. I work in healthcare, which of course takes all kinds, and the majority of people I meet are very nice. Of course you'll meet people who are enthusiastic to talk about their religion or whatever else it is they're passionate about or that has changed their life, but I have yet to meet anyone who was pushy about converting me or whatever. I have had a few people give me the business card for their church and invite me to a service, but I can say that as long as you're not, like, outrightly argumentative about it then people really don't push it. I haven't done it myself, but I do believe that most of the religious people would be understanding if you were to openly explain why it is that you don't follow any religious practices (as in,not saying ""oh god no I don't do anything like that "" or anything else inflammatory) and would be understanding. Or, you can just nod politely, say thank you for any sort of invitation or advice, and not pursue the subject.   For the most part, though, this is a very welcoming place for all sorts of people because we have a pretty great deal of diversity without the factions being so large that they become 'cliquey' if that makes sense :)"

ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,SpiritOfSpite,3,Fri Jul 17 05:31:56 2015 UTC,"I think the whole mindset is kind of ""don't ask, don't tell"". People won't try to convert you and will generally leave you alone unless you go asking for it. Actually one thing I've noticed about the Springs is that a ton of Christian sects and branches are present here including Jesuits, Mormons, Christian Scientists, and all the hardcore people but also Episcopalians, Quakers, and all number of others. It might sound counter-intuitive but I think that diversity actually makes the Springs a little more tame than if it was mostly centered around one flavor of jesus-love. That being said, probably still avoid New Life and Focus on the Family. Also, we have some other religions represented too. People here might be on average pretty religious but they mostly keep it within their respective religious communities."
ColoradoSprings,3dkdcp,wtfudgsicle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you recommend avoiding New Life - they seem much better off with the new guy leading them since Ted.

If the world were about to be destroyed by a meteor, Manitou wouldn't hear about it until it hit them because they'd be too busy crooning over some kitschy item at their local artist co-op.   I'm surprised subway even managed to open up a restaurant out there."

I was speeding and am not denying he shouldn't have pulled me over; however, before he even had my license I heard a call over his radio for a needed response to reported domestic violence. He then shut his radio off. A 5mph over the speed limit was more important to this guy than domestic violence. Then he asked for my license and I explained it was in my wallet in my back pocket and asked permission to reach for it. He said to go ahead and when I reached for it he stuck his gun in my face, yelled at me, and called for 2 more motorcycle cops. So a few blocks away there is domestic violence, but the 17 (at the time) year old kid in khakis and a polo on his way to work who was going 5 over must have his car searched because he asked to reach for his wallet. They didn't find anything, but I lost my job because the whole ordeal took hours.

I feel like the police officer 1) should not have sat her down in that manner, regardless of her prior behavior, and 2) never should have slammed her in that manner. Our officers signed up for a job, to serve and protect, and yes, deal with abusive members of society. In the same way doctors and nurses practice bedside manner, police should practice self-control as well. I don't care how she treated him before the camera, it doesn't matter if we can't hear what she is saying; the officer is not the judge, jury, and executioner. If she injures him before detainment, she should be made responsible for those actions in court. I'm not in any way condoning what she did, but I absolutely despise the way the office acted."

From people who genuinely believe the girl did nothing wrong because no one told them and they don't bother to do their research. Some even went to say she deserves massive compensation for life beyond medical. Or that because something worse happened, which I'm not denying, absolves her of punishment which makes no sense."

Thank you for removing pets from your life, and truly I hope you have realized that since you're incapable of caring for a cat that you don't adopt any other pets. God forbid you have children, they're much more difficult to dump. People do leave animals all the time and they use lame excuses like ""moving"" and ""allergies"" to abandon their pets that they don't feel like caring for anymore. And probably didn't care for very well to begin with. The ""Aw, cute kitty, I'm gonna adopt you and love you until you're grown up and no fun anymore"" type of people. When you adopt a pet it's a lifelong commitment and a responsibility. Pets are family, not luxury. Make the lifelong commitment or don't get one.

I mean I keep seeing ""no significant breakthrough"" thrown around here but let's be honest, when did Tesla really get any ""significant"" credit or notice for the things he did? My point is that he was a genius that spent time here and plenty of other places that have been graced with the presence of a genius have then milked that celebrity to its fullest. Example: pretty much any place in Europe where DaVinci lived or spent time. It would be easy to have an actual Tesla museum, or something loosely based around him, in the Springs. The closest we had was Colorado College doing an exhibition on his time in the Springs. And the current Tesla ""museum"" is little more than a ranting, for-rent, nutjob with a sketchy basement. I think the real reason why we don't have anything honoring him and why no one seems motivated to build one is because the Springs is still a pretty folksy, traditional, conservative (Christian) brand of American, and Tesla's story, including his history with Edison, might not fit in too well. Plus from what I can tell a lot of the tourists who come to the city are of a similar, non-scientifically motivated mindset.  Sorry for rant, and I'm not trying to hate on the Springs, I love this place."

Manitou: Swirl is a good wine and tapas place, the Manitou Brewing Company is pretty fun if you like small brewery hanging out. Check out Graffiti Falls if you're into that (google) or the abandoned train tunnels.   Old Colorado City: is a nice walk around. There are a few local galleries to look at. Brother Luck is pretty good for food.   Downtown: I live downtown and this is where I usually hang out. There are some art galleries here, the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center (small museum, $15, has some surprisingly good paintings). The Modbo is a tiny independent art gallery in an alleyway.   I like Brewer's Republic. They have a good selection of microbrews. I also hang at the Wild Goose (wants very much to be in Brooklyn and called Blue Bottle) and  Supernova (barcade).   If you're into short but pretty hikes, I like the Mount Cutler hike in the Cheyenne Mountain National Park. It's only a mile and you get up pretty high for some nice views.

I'll venture to say you have drum brakes, and can confirm by checking that the front and rear brakes look different. (disc vs drum) Disc brakes would've never made it to 100k miles either. Also to triple check, the GL model had drum, the GLS had disc, look for a badge or dig out the manual.  Based on your mileage you should replace the drums.  Some shopping on rockauto.com shows that for drums/shoes you're looking at $55 shipped. PM me and let's get you fixed up.  edit: read more comments, GLS would've never come with steel rims either.

ColoradoSprings,3d0fe9,SWiG,2,Mon Jul 13 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I did it, but the ascent took me 4 hours to reach the top. I would say to plan for 8 and start early (4-5am) so you miss afternoon storms. It is challenging. I would first try the incline to see what the altitude does to you.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barr_Trail"
ColoradoSprings,3d0fe9,nemesis1637,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"You mean only get to the top? Not hike back down too? That's totally doable (and really not that hard). If you want to try something easier first, try summiting from the backside trail. It starts at the Crags campground and is roughly half as long. Head over to 14ers.com and look around. TONS of information (including hiking times from 100s of people)."
ColoradoSprings,3d0fe9,Colossonaut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:41 2015 UTC,"I did it with a buddy a month ago, in a day, when the last 2.5 miles were still frozen. Here's my take.   Don't do it when the top is still frozen. Everyone on the trail that day said it was impossible. It was not. But it was fairly difficult and dangerous. You won't have to worry about this. It's nearly 13 mi to the top from Manitou. Make plans to get back down. Some people take the cog, which costs around $18 on the weekdays for one-way, DOUBLE on the weekends. You could hike down the other side (7 mi) but you'd need to park a car back there beforehand. You could also just hike 26 mi. This hike is up and up and up for 13 mi. I don't care what kind of shoes you have, put some moleskin on the back of your heels. They'll be rubbing the back of your boot the entire trip, and you're guaranteed to blister. This will help. Just trust me, and bring extra. Take breaks. Every dick wagger in town tries to set a record climbing PP. The average is 8-10hr.  We did it in 9, but that's including 2.5 mi of ice/no trail AND x2 one hour breaks (once for Barr Camp and once for a nap). We made it to Barr Camp (halfway) in less than 3 hours, realized how fast we were going, and slowed down to enjoy the day. The hardest part (unless the top us frozen over) is the first 3 miles. The rest is gravy. Bring a light jacket for the last 2-3 miles. The temp doesn't drop until you get past the tree line. A windbreaker will do.   So, yes, it's entirely feasible to do this in one day. Bring a few snacks- dehydrated meals and trail desserts can be bought at Barr Camp, about 6.5 mi from the start. Wear moleskin. Bring ample water. Have fun."

The job market isn't the greatest right now and when I first moved here I got a crappy retail job and it barely got me by. My suggestion to you is to possibly look at Staffing Agencies out here. Look up SNI and Modis and see if they can help you find some work. The cost of living here is a fair bit higher than PA was, at least for me. But I'd say try to have something kind of concrete before moving out here. Feel free to ask any more questions! The reddit community here is pretty :)"
ColoradoSprings,3cxrru,PM_ME_UR_ARMPIT,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:35:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response!! How much in savings did you have before the move? Where in PA are you from? Im from lancaster so when i see people complaining that COsprings is conservative i wonder how it is compared to Pennsylvania? Not that that is really a factor in my decision to move. Im also planning on sharing the place with my girlfriend who would help pay rent. I wil definitely check out the staffing agencies i really appreciate it!

The springs is probably more conservative than what PA was for me. had a little over $1000 when I came out here. I knew people though and was able to take some time looking for work while I lived with them, so I didn't need a lot of savings to begin with. There's definitely affordable places to live here, don't listen to that other guy. Yes, it's very military focused, but that doesn't affect too much. The affordable places won't be great, but hey it's a place to live. My apartment is $525/mo for a 1 bed 1 bath."

Because military people get housing they also don't care how much they pay in rent so the rent here is ridiculous because they raise the market price.  If you wanna work in mmj do Fort Collins or Boulder.  COS blows!!!

Both times Ive gone in it has taken like 2-3 hours, but it is pretty damn cheap for a dealership.

Why does it take them that long to get it to residential customers who would eat that shit up, making them even more money?   Because businesses are willing to pay higher prices, along with install fees and in return get better SLAs and typically better service. We've been fighting with the city for several months now over permitting and gaining access to the city owned right of ways. First we were told to obtain CLEC certification from the state. But here in Colorado, the PUC won't issue the necessary certificate for data only, as it's unregulated. (Which is utter bullshit, but nevermind) DORA-Telecom specifically said we needed to purchase and install a Class 5 switch, and originate POTS traffic before they would even consider our application, meaning not kick it back out of hand.    Now that the Title 2 changes have gone into effect (All ISPs are Title II common Carriers according to a recent ruling by the FCC), the cvity dropped the requirement for CLEC certification but is still dragging it's feet on issuing the necessary permits and allowing access to RoWs, dragging it's feet to the point where we've begun the litigation process.

I've called them 2 times I think, and never sat on hold for more than a minute or two. The first time was when the speeds were super slow for 15min and then recovered after resetting the modem.

I dealt with TWC back in California as well, and they were just as bad as they are now (on the opposite end of the country, no less).  Everybody hates Comcast, but at least in CS, if you are looking for near-fiber speeds, they are not so bad. I had 50/10 with them and had only one outage lasting a day or two (which was impossible to figure out). I know Comcast maxed out at 105/15 when I moved in, but now they're offering 250/25 (for $150, mind you). They're also offering 150/15 for $50/mo for a year, which is a steal considering they had me paying $60 for my first year.  Consider yourself lucky. I am paying as much as I paid for Comcast, but TWC is limiting me to 30/5 and I'm getting 7/2 on average.

Make sure you have solid documentation on anything and everything that you want to use in your case. In other words, you cannot make it a ""my word against hers"" sort of thing because the Courts will usually rule in favor of the mother.  For example - keep your receipts, even from the grocery store, that show you are buying food for the child.  Of course, she can lie, and say you did not buy the food, or at least ever deliver it to her for your child.  But the Judge would be inclined to accept the receipts as evidence on your behalf, because why would you keep receipts for food purchases, just to SAY you bought the food for the child, when if fact you didn't.  Get my drift?  Additionally, if drugs are involved, then this is an extremely dangerous situation for the child to be in - I would involve the authorities IMMEDIATELY !  Call El Paso County Department of Human Services, Child Welfare division and report the ""alleged"" drug use/drug exposure - they will get all over this immediately with police involvement and shut 'em down if it's true.

ColoradoSprings,3c7gsa,flippant,2,Thu Jul 9 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to offer some advice on this matter. I hope you find what I've learned from my auto glass issues helpful.   Right off the bat, whatever you do, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go to ABRA auto body. I was involved with a horrible experience there to the point that I vowed to advise everyone I come across (when it's relevant, of course; not apropos of nothing) to avoid them if at all possible. $300 to replace an entire windshield is very reasonable. Safelite did a great job on my wife's first Subaru after the crazy hail literally shattered hers last year.  Check your insurance policy. Most carriers don't have a cool glass policy. I know Amica insurance has a nice glass add-on you can get that is pretty cheap and what it does is provides full replacement for any glass (windshield, side windows, and rear window) free of charge. Normally, there is no glass provision so it falls under your Comprehensive coverage, and so, you must pay your deductible. Since this is probably at least $500, the cost of the repair is less than the cost of your deductible, so you may as well pay out of pocket since there's no point to making a claim. That said there are some places who offer to replace glass at no cost to you because they pay the deductible. I have no idea how this works so proceed with caution.    If you can get a glass add-on or similar from your insurance, it would probably be worth it here in good ol' Colorado Springs for two reasons: hail and shitty-as-fuck roads. The first one is an obvious danger to your auto glass, and the latter is sneaky; since the roads are so shit here, it means gravel and such is kicked up onto your windshield on the highways on the regular, resulting in chips and cracks very frequently.   TL;DR: $300 is a good price from a reputable vendor. You can feel good about this. Your insurance will probably cover it but it is likely your deductible is more than the cost of the repair, meaning you'll just pay out of pocket for it anyway.   Hope this helps! :)"

If you have a $500 deductible or higher, it's not worth it to file a claim, because the cost of replacing the windshield is less than your deductible."

ColoradoSprings,3c40tp,nonspecificwife,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:00:25 2015 UTC,Norteast side of town. Take Barnes (going East) off of powers and turn right (south) on Tutt. I'm thinking about posting up In costco or On the Border restaurant parking lot. Both on the corner of Powers  and Barnes.

ColoradoSprings,3c40tp,CoSunny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:29:18 2015 UTC,Just found a park on Google maps about 2 blocks from the stadium. May post up there.  Sandstone park. Really small park but Looks like they have a play area for the little ones and a great view of the sky over the stadium. I think this trumps costco/on the border parking lots.

A few years ago, before A64 passed, some friends and I drove to the overlook and got incredibly baked. We parked the car, smoked a bowl, and sat on the terrace overlooking the whole city at midnight. The sight was totally unforgettable, like seeing a galaxy on the ground, sprawling in every direction for miles.  We went back to the car after like half an hour and started loading another bowl. We were sitting in the car for a couple minutes when a cop came knocking on the window. Instant terror. But he'd been going car to car and asking folks to take off and have a good night. He must have known, but he was totally chill. We said good night and went on our way."

But turns out the Enterprise shuttle stopped at Peterson AFB back in 1983, on it's way to the Paris Air Show:  The Space Shuttle Enterprise, the nation's prototype space shuttle orbiter, before departing NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, at 11:00 a.m., 16 May 1983, on the first leg of its trek to the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport, Paris, France. Seen here atop the huge 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), the first stop for the Enterprise was Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Piloting the 747 on the Europe trip were Joe Algranti, Johnson Space Center Chief Pilot, Astronaut Dick Scobee, and NASA Dryden Chief Pilot Tom McMurtry. Flight engineers for that portion of the flight were Dryden's Ray Young and Johnson Space Center's Skip Guidry.

ColoradoSprings,3bt2py,ananaba,4,Wed Jul 1 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"For my 21st, I went downtown to Jose Muldoons for dinner and barhopped to a great sports bar (i can't remember the name of it, I'm sorry, but it is in the main part of downtown), Gasoline Alley, Blondies, and finally Jack Quinn's. At the sports bar we played pool and it was a great crowd, big open space, clean bathrooms, good service. Gasoline Alley had an excellent bartender and an excellent younger, more alternative-based (hipster, you could say) crowd. Blondies was more club like with dim lights and loud music, but the bartender was EXCELLENT. When he heard it was my birthday, he made their signature chocolate pie martini (delicious, very sweet, but I wouldn't have more than one) and did a fire-breathing trick. Very cool and again a very friendly environment. Jack Quinn's is a great pub-style environment and they had live music when I was there. We danced in front of the stage and got lots of people to join us, I even danced with some strangers. Jack Quinn's tends to have a little bit older crowd, but that's awesome because it tends to be a more level-headed and fun-loving environment.   Hope this helps! Personally, I'd stay away from anything TOO clubby because when you're getting 21st-birthday wasted the younger, thirstier crowd can get hot headed and out of hand very quickly. Also, I know that lots of places downtown offer 1 free shot on your birthday. Have a wonderful time!! :)  Edit: I would really recommend staying away from Copperhead Road (the one right on academy with the giant cowboy and pink car in front of it). They get a lot of millitary, a lot of young people (very loud music, huge dance floor, scantily dressed bartenders, etc.), and it's just an environment where things can get out of hand very quickly. It's definitely not a terrible place, I've been there with my boyfriend a couple of times, and once you get comfortable with your limits with public drinking you may want to check it out because it can be fun. It's just a place where you're really best to stay very level-headed. Just a word of caution. Again, I hope you have a really great time!"

ColoradoSprings,3bpwpi,RadioContra,5,Wed Jul 1 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"UPDATE~!!  Cubby's been found!!  Thank you all for your suggestions!!  Thanks, Micah, for getting the word out there! A lovely young couple found her and kept her safe and sound.  They saw one of our posters this afternoon and called.  We're so happy and relieved!"
ColoradoSprings,3bpwpi,Redwitha2d,2,Wed Jul 1 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with RadioContra and have a few more suggestions: Hope this helps.   On facebook there are 2 groups called ""black forest lost and found"" and ""colorado springs lost pet alert"". They both have very good success rates. Post a picture and details to their facebook page.  Whether you have lost a pet or found one, there are tasks you should do right away   File a report with the Humane Society. This can be done online here:   LOST: https://www.hsppr.org/hsppr/lost-and-found/lost-my-pet FOUND: https://www.hsppr.org/hsppr/lost-and-found/found-a-pet   Check/Post on Craiglist   Check/Post to Craiglist this is a place a lot of people go to when a pet is lost/found. Craiglist can be tricky. WHEN POSTING: Be clear if you have FOUND a dog. Post in Lost and Found OR in Pets, or both. Include a picture. We know there is concern abut someone claiming a dog that is not their, but leaving a picture out makes it tough for the peopel who are sincerely trying to find their pet. There are other ways to confirm ownership. WHEN SEARCHING: Some people will post ""LOST DOG"" when they FOUND a lost dog. The breeds can be wrong -- we have seen a cattle dog listed as an American Bulldog before. They can also leave very vague posts-- e.g. ""i found a dog-call to describe"" NOTE: There have been some cases where dogs have been found being rehomed on Craiglist, so please keep an eye on all areas of Caiglsist.   Microchip- make sure info is up-to-date, and if you found a pet, have it scanned, any vet will do it.   If you lost a dog, make sure your information is up to date, and register with www.found.org since it covers ALL microchips.   Flyers!!! MOST Important!!! Post Flyers. Big Fliers. Let people know you are missing you pet. Unfortunately, some people will not call the Humane Society, and may not actively look for you, but if they see a flyer they may think twice about keeping your pet. Additionally, if one person in the family has decided to keep you pet, but someone else see the sign they might act on getting your pet back.  Here are a couple of links about flyers http://dogingtonpost.com/tips-for-an-effective-lost-dog-poster/#.Uzv-E1dMpVV  http://www.missingpetpartnership.org/recovery-posters.php   5) ask (if they regally come around or there at the time of loss) the mailman, UPS, Fed Ex, cable guy and Trash folks if they have seen the animal.  6) Scent Station SCENT Dogs and Cats see the world with their noses. If you are missing a pet puts something with a familiar scent in the area where they were lost, so they can track the scent and stay near by. For cats, we have hear litter boxes suggested, for dog we recommend a blanket or T-shirt (worn by someone they dog is bonded to). Put these in an area with water, and check back at varying times. If your pet was lost in a larger area, trying strips of a blanket spread as sort of a bread crumb trail.   7) ADD YOURSELF TO THE PETHARBOR EMAIL LIST: CHECK AREA SHELTER by going to Petharbor.com This is a site that can search a broader area, but should not replace going to the Humane Society/Shelter closest to where your pet was Pet harbor.com will allow you to search at shelters within a 200 mile radius of your zip code. You can request to get notification on new pets coming in."

ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,codpiece,3,Tue Jun 30 04:00:26 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same issues when I moved here over a year ago, I assume that's what it is. I know I helped my husband pack all of our stuff in Georgia no problem and loaded the uhaul with ease. But when we unpacked here I literally had to stop and just cry because I was so overwhelmed and felt like I didn't understand how my body functioned anymore. I never ever used to get anxious or overwhelmed. It took me several months to adjust last year, which I was also very out of shape at the time. I would suggest over-doing the water! Seriously, drink a ton of water!"
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,MrsSampson,3,Tue Jun 30 07:24:42 2015 UTC,"You may try adding an iron supplement to your diet as well. You really can't force your body to produce blood more quickly (as far as I'm aware), but adding iron may help your blood to carry more oxygen. Hope this helps, but if it doesn't just try to remember that in a month or few your body will adjust and you WILL get back to feeling normal again. So if you can, try not to add to your anxiety by worrying about your anxiety :)"

ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,Kirix,2,Tue Jun 30 07:23:34 2015 UTC,I lived above 7k feet for over 15 years. Whenever we had flatlanders come visit my family we would give them 'Altitude Adjustment Pills' which we bought at the drug store. I can't format but I found a link to the same pills my family has been giving visitors for years.  Also eating or smoking marijuana can help the body acclimate.  Good luck and welcome to CO!  https://www.railriders.com/altitude-adjustment-tablets-p-1017.html
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,ajisme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:33:39 2015 UTC,I recently moved here from Louisiana (46 feet above sea level) and have had a horrible time adjusting. Attempted to do the Incline Saturday and we only made it 1/3 of the way up. I felt like I couldn't breathe which scared me and made me breather harder which was counter productive. I attempted to push through but eventually we had to turn around. My only advice would be give yourself time and don't push too hard.
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,HoppersMomma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend a powdered sport drink called Acli-Mate. You can get it at whole foods in the Rocky Mountain region. Great for altitude, energy, and relieving stress."
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,OneBakedPotato,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Sounds like me when I moved here, although I was already prone to anxiety. Be gentle with yourself and try to remember that it's just your brain doing its job, in its own unpleasant way.  BTW, you may also feel anxiety if you visit sea level after a year or so. It caught me by surprise the first time I went back to CA. The excess oxygen was basically the same thing as hyperventilating in slow motion, which activated other anxiety responses before I figured out what was going on."
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,curse_in_disguise,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"A Dr here told me just after we moved here from basically sea level that it takes about three months for your body to catch up on red blood cells. Almost five months later and if I get dehydrated even a little I also have anxiety because I feel like I am not getting enough oxygen. My go to solution for headache, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness,  dizziness and anxiousness is to drink water, and lots of it. I did notice an improvement in my endurance level when hiking and such after about three months. I dont get winded like I used to going up the stairs. Drink water."
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,Cactuslickerlover,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:51:59 2015 UTC,I think it's likely you have it as well. Can you see a doc or have someone take you to the ER?     They will basically give you some oxygen for short term relief. Then they give you some pills to take for like a week or so to help you acclimate. Ibuprofen is supposed to help but it is nowhere near as good as the pills they give you at the hospital.
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,Stacker_Pentecost,0,Tue Jun 30 07:27:20 2015 UTC,The only solution I know of is to sleep with three handfuls of your native soil in your bed. .. Muahahahajajja Also pot.

ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,SpiritOfSpite,-1,Tue Jun 30 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"Shortness of breath and light-headedness, esp. If combined with weak, tingilingness in your fingers would be a sign that 1) you have anxiety and 2) you've increased your breathing rate out of nervousness. This leads to a loss of CO2, which your muscles need. To test and give yourself more CO2, hold a paper bag near your mouth and slowly breath in and out of it for a little bit.  The air here has more than enough O2, you're going to be fine in that regard. But if you are slightly hyperventilating, the above can help."
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,jngreenlee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:04:04 2015 UTC,Sorry if this advice bothered anyone. I'm sharing what my DR told me personally about the same thing.
ColoradoSprings,3blc3m,jngreenlee,0,Tue Jun 30 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Moved here from California (sea level).  Took me several months to fully acclimate (adjust). I particularly noticed the atmospheric difference when exerting energy (like simply taking a flight of stairs - OMFG !!!).  There is really nothing that will speed up the process for you, it is simply an adjustment process that your body will make, and the timing will differ per the individual person.  You might find, however, for the anxiety problem that a mild prescription tranquilizer, like Xanax, will do the trick for you to help you get through the time it takes for you to fully acclimate."

ColoradoSprings,3bkjz7,airventure,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"We're renting with a German Shepard mix & just went through this recently so here's something that helped us find a place.  We were looking to rent with 3 pets - 2 dogs & a cat, with one of them being a large dog so we had multiple strikes against us.  For a lot of folks, they're not going to budge on whatever limit they have in place.  For the ones that were willing to at least discuss exceptions, we made up a letter (with cute pictures:) to ""introduce"" our pets.  Included age, that they were already potty-trained, shot records, etc.  Multiple folks told us that simply having put in the effort to have this already prepared put us in the ""responsible pet owner"" bucket & made them willing to make exceptions. YMMV, but this tip from our realtor helped us a lot so figured I'd pass it along."

ColoradoSprings,3b8c5h,herbyurby,3,Fri Jun 26 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Filmore Crossing, I believe, is the nicest one in the city which allows pitbulls.  Almost all pet-friendly complexes will have breed restrictions; few will be willing (or even able) to skirt them. Many have insurance policies that explicitly prohibit certain breeds full-stop, and they can't do anything about it. However, you can work with those who don't to try to get around the ban.  Obedience training and tricks help put on a good impression if you choose to bring your dog with you apartment hunting. A ""letter of recommendation"" from your current landlord is even better (research this yourself - you'll want to write your own and have them sign it to save them time). Above all, don't argue or get defensive - it's not worth your time (or stress) to try to point out that risky breeds are a myth.  You probably are already aware that renter's insurance will go up with a dog (especially a pit). Unfortunately, landlord's insurance policies are the same, and the vast majority opt for simply banning high-risk breeds to lower their costs. If you switch to a house, you need to be aware of whether the HOA has an insurance policy which also prohibits certain breeds - you may run into a similar problem.  Word of warning - most leases stipulate that if they ever find out you are housing a dog against their breed restrictions, you will be forced to rehome your dog within 24-48 hours (otherwise your dog will be confiscated from you) or you will simply be evicted on the spot. Don't run that risk, even if you find a perfect place (sans breed restrictions)."

ColoradoSprings,3b4tlf,weauxbreaux,0,Sat Jun 27 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that people who go door to door are taught to target people with 'No Soliciting' signs, and often get their biggest sales off them. The logic is that most of the people who put them up have a hard time saying ""No""."
ColoradoSprings,3b4tlf,weauxbreaux,2,Fri Jun 26 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"Believe what you want, but this information came from the mouth of a colleague who used to do door to door sales. This is how he trained his people. His biggest sales came from people with the signs.   1 out of 10 times he got yelled at for ignoring the sign, maybe 3/10 people sheepishly pointed at the sign and closed the door, 6/10 were easy sales. ""The off chance that you get yelled at is totally worth the easy sales.""   Proof? I have a 'No Soliciting' sign (already there when I bought the house), and I've never seen anyone skip my house because of it."
ColoradoSprings,3b4tlf,tlwilson32,3,Fri Jun 26 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"I still don't believe you.   You don't believe that I had a conversation with a former door to door salesman? Why would I make that up?   Do you accept my proof? If yes then why are you arguing? If no then why should I accept yours?   It sounds like our 'No Soliciting' signs are yielding different results. People definitely ignore mine, and seem to respect yours.  So are we arguing on whether ""No Soliciting"" signs actually work?   All the houses I have had them on, I have still gotten knocks from solicitors. I've talked to a number of people who have the same result. This alone tells me that they don't actually work. Do you not believe that solicitors ignore my sign?  As far as your proof? Sure - I will accept that you have not gotten a single knock from a solicitor. However, this doesn't prove to me that the sign is the reason why. I am arguing this, because as I stated, my sign goes ignored.  Here are a few of the first results of a google search related to the topic that support my stance (A. the signs don't work.  &  B. salespeople are told to ignore the signs.)  http://www.yelp.com/topic/belmont-do-no-solicitors-signs-on-front-door-work-tired-of-ding-dong-will-you-read-our-brochure  http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=11426   In any case. I'm sticking on my first point. Laws for the sake of laws are dumb and reduce respect for the law in general. This would end up being just another unenforced and mostly unenforceable law. There are so many other remedies short of a law that work just fine and even when none of those remedies are taken it is still not that big of a deal to just close the door in a stranger's face.   No argument here."
ColoradoSprings,3b4tlf,kodiakinc,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"I was top sales #1 in COS for a Cable company and i ignored all no soliciting signs.  What that guy said is right people who use no sol signs have a hard time saying no.  I only didn't knock on doors with hand written very specific signs.  If you put that much effort in i know you're serious and I'm about to get an earful.  I did d2d for 3 years kirby, cable.  Kirby paid shit, cable paid ~ 75k.  D2d should not be banned mom n pops need d2d.  Sometimes its the only affordable advertising.  Some companies cant buy commercials and junk mail gets... Junked.  D2d helps drum up business for cheap until you can get referrals and marketing budgets rolling.  Does COS like having only chain stores?  Because banning d2d is how you get there."
ColoradoSprings,3b4tlf,weauxbreaux,2,Fri Jun 26 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"And I'm pretty sure your disbelief doesn't change anything.  I worked in telecom sales for 3 different companies over a decade, both commercial and residential (back in the 90s it was common to do door to door pitches for long distance and local service) and at every company the salesmen were straight up told to ignore ""No Soliciting"" signs. Common tactics were to respond with:    ""Oh, sorry. I didn't understand what 'soliciting' meant."" ""I'm not selling anything, just setting appointments"" ""I'm not soliciting, I'm here to save you money on your long distance bill. Who handles those decisions?"" ""Sorry, no I didn't see the sign""'   And so on. A direct quote from almost every sales manager ever is ""So? If they don't do business with you, you're in the same situation you were in before you walked in. It's a numbers game. Either you're in to win or you need to find a new career."".

ColoradoSprings,3b0qxf,uninan,3,Thu Jun 25 01:15:33 2015 UTC,"I've spent a good amount of time in both and I think it just comes down to what you're looking for into a place to live.  Ft. Collins:   Higher cost of living. Bar/social scenes are younger and party oriented for the most part. Very active community if you're into parties and bigger gatherings. A good amount of awesome restaurants are around, but you'll probably pay more and have to do more sifting through gimmicky places. Not much mountain scenery, but plenty of open grasslands and some good trails and fishing spots if you're into those things. Slightly less snow that seems like it melts a bit quicker. Roads seem like they get plowed a little faster.   Colorado Springs:   More affordable, not too hard to find a cheap place if you're willing to live with a roommate or in a smaller apartment. A bit more snow that tends to stick around longer. I-25 can get bad during the winter months, but there are plenty of back-roads in and around the Springs. Fantastic scenery and hiking. You'll probably be able to see Pike's Peak from your home and the trails on and around the mountains are amazing. Plus, you'll have Garden of the Gods damn near in your backyard. Plenty of quiet watering holes and good restaurants in the area. You can find a rowdier, party type crowd out there, but it won't be the norm. If you're into live shows, CO Springs does have some great venues that get some awesome bands and comics from time to time."

Apart from an occasional Walmart type store, I rarely have problems in the cities and in between. As a bonus, if you have a newer phone, CS/Denver are launch markets for their new low frequency network being rolled out.  It gets iffy as you go up into mountains, but that's true for most carriers. 95% of your time, you should be pretty well set. If you go east to the plains you will start to roam onto Viaero and AT&T, and they both work just fine."

If you go straight ahead from the top of the escalator you will go directly to the concourses (obviously through security, etc). Right at the top of the escalators there are a few shops/a restaurant/ and a waiting area for people who are waiting to pick people up. This is where everyone stands/waits for the new arrivals.

The I-225 can be truly hellish sometimes, completely stopped the whole way. Just keep in mind that Castle Rock is nearly a tenth of the size of CS (weighing in at around 50,000 people) so you'll be living on the border of what qualifies as a small-ish city. Monument is a tenth of that so don't expect much out there.  I would stick to Longmont or Boulder if I were you. But I'm not you, so good luck. If all else fails, you obviously can just pick a place for your apartment and shop around once you get here."

Rocky Mountain Adventure Riders is a non-profit organization based in Colorado Springs that hosts large dualsport events to raise money for organizations like COHVCO (Colorado Off Road Vehicle Coalition), TPA (Trail Preservation Alliance), Ride With Respect to help maintain access and raise awareness for responsible usage of trails for off road vehicles.  Grace Moto Adventures is another group based in Colorado Springs that also run rides, but they are more of a faith based ministry, if that's your thing.  I would highly recommend checking out the Rocky Mountain Regional Forum on advrider.com - there is a strong community of riders there - many from Colorado and Colorado Springs, and rides are constantly being organized.  I would guess at least one ride per week leaving Colorado Springs is organized on that forum (Look for a poster named Proveick - he organizes a lot of bigger bike, gravel/dirt road type rides; or just send him a PM)  I ride a Suzuki DRZ400, and tend to do a lot more dirt and trails than you probably want to try on that big GS, but I'd be happy to run down Mt.

Discouraging growth is part of why Colorado Springs has the problems it does today, I'd hope that CDOT doesn't help contribute to this more.  The Colorado Springs City Council helped turn part of the area into bedroom communities already.  Massive investment only in the military for decades, with tons of families that move every few years. I felt out of place being a native owning a home on the east side of the city.  They city also did very little to hold on to all the tech jobs in the area over the past few decades. Those companies that didn't want to lose the talent they found in the area set up shop in South Denver. Something is seriously wrong when a company like HP feels they are better off selling land and buildings they own in the city to just set up a leased building setup elsewhere."

ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,eta_carinae_311,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"What has COS ever done to discourage growth?   Quite a bit, with most of the decisions that lead to the state of the city made decades back.  The city actively refused funds from both the state and federal government to expand I-25 within the city. These discussions date back to the 80s.  Tied up in that was also discussions to improve east/west mobility.  Constitution was supposed to connect to I-25, and continue on all the way to Centennial.  I-25 has been widened now to improve city mobility, but the second project I believe is still shelved until at least next decade.  Refusing to address the mobility and infrastructure issues helped encourage more businesses to look elsewhere. Every time I fly back, I'm reminded of this when I walk through the ""new"" airport, and see the expansion wing sitting completely unused.  Multiple initiatives were up for vote in the 90s to try and limit growth in other ways. Some of it was to try and address sprawl, though most of that focus was up in Denver, not COS.  I hinted at the tech problem, where the city had very similar opportunities as Austin, TX did to become a tech giant. The city really didn't do much to work with any of these businesses, especially compared to their efforts towards the military and olympic training center. I saw this first hand by following the Intel situation closely after they bought the old Rockwell plant. Intel wanted to invest big time in the area, build a second fab, and always have one in operation while the other one was being retooled (I knew the manager overseeing this plan). The city refused to work with Intel, and ultimately that opportunity was lost. Talk to any of the remaining techies around, and you will find similar stories from all kinds of people. All Intel wanted was to work with the city to find the ideal spot for the second fab, and figuring out the logistics of a workforce that would be shifting their workplace every year or so.  It is good to see the city address some of the infrastructure problems and improving east/west mobility slowly. Those changes should have happened back in the 80s when they were needed during that boom, or again after 2000 with the second boom."

I absolutely agree that the city failed to encourage non-military job growth, especially in the tech sector. But I wouldn't call that discouraging growth, it's just the conservative, small-government, hands-off approach to the economy.  Honestly, COS can't even handle potholes and stormwater. How's it going to be a high-tech hub?"
ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,OfficerNelson,2,Thu Jun 18 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"But I wouldn't call that discouraging growth, it's just the conservative, small-government, hands-off approach to the economy.  Honestly, COS can't even handle potholes and stormwater. How's it going to be a high-tech hub?   You identified a key part of the issue.  Colorado Springs used to not be nearly as conservative and libertarian in it's policies. That political culture rift between Manitou Springs and Colorado Springs once was a rift between the area in general and the military. The rise of the evangelical community in the area helped push that shift, fueled by people leaving the conservative areas of Southern California to settle in the area.  It also used to have infrastructure that wasn't crumbling. But thanks to policies from the city council over the decades, and well the city couldn't even be bothered to ensure it could keep street lights somewhat recently, much less make sure the streets are okay. TABOR and other actions by Douglas Bruce certainly haven't helped either.  The message of trying to limit growth has dissipated over the past decade or so thankfully. I bet if you talk to locals that were in the area in the 80s and 90s, they will also remember that curbing growth was an often cited reason for so many of the above policies and changes. I don't follow the local politics there closely enough to know if that message was suppressed, or if that mentality overall has finally faded.  Anyhow, some of this was me venting, and thank you for tolerating it.  I love the area, and miss it quite a bit. I get frustrated over witnessing so much of the decline of the city, and continue to hope that the upward trend recently continues strongly. At times it feels like the recent wildfire disasters and other issues have helped bring back some of the old positive community spirit of the area I remember from decades past."

ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,better-off-ted,3,Tue Jun 16 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"Hi, I live in Lone Tree and work in downtown Colorado Springs. Traffic is a breeze when the weather is good - takes me about an hour door to door. In the winter Monument Hill can be terrible and I will work from home on really bad snow days.  If you're working in DTC area the traffic at the moment piles up pretty bad right at I-25 and Lincoln, which is where I get on the highway in the morning to commute south. The backup can go all the way to Castle Pines. They're expanding the lanes there though and once that's completed it should be good. Traffic doesn't get really bad going north until close to 730 - 8 from what I can tell, so if you can adjust your hours to go in slightly early/ leave a bit early you should be just fine! :) South of Lincoln all the way to the Springs is fine unless there's an accident or bad weather. Between Larkspur and Monument you're screwed if it backs up as there is just nowhere to get off. You've got a couple of options if you know to jump off ahead of time - highway 105 through Perry Park/ Palmer Lake or 83 through Parker/ Castle Rock are the alternatives through that area. A bit of a detour though, so it's only beneficial if traffic is at an absolute dead stop."
ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,ASquirrelNamedLloyd,2,Tue Jun 16 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I did that commute for about a year.   The times you mentioned are accurate under ideal conditions, but if you plan on driving through the Tech Center (the south most stretch of I-25 as you are coming into Denver) it will take much, much longer during the rush hours. Probably closer to 90 minutes on average.   Also, as somebody else mentioned, I 25 between Colorado Springs and Castlerock is absolutely not safe when it snows. There were a couple times I had to come home from Denver and I was legitimately afraid for my life.

ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,raiderato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:57:06 2015 UTC,Those times seem fairly accurate. Of course snow on monument hill might slow you down from time to time and Denver traffic can be a bitch. My girlfriend drives from NE COS to Aurora almost daily and it takes her a bit more than an hour each way. Her times are better if she leaves at 6am rather than 7am. I would recommend using Waze on your phone when commuting.
ColoradoSprings,3a2b09,Anitapoop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"South Denver traffic can get bad in the dtc area, so you'll probably be looking at a 1 hour commute on average but it will vary greatly. Traffic in the morning at the gates on ft Carson can slow you down too so I'd plan for 45 minutes in the morning going to ft Carson. But monument is definitely the best middle ground for you guys. Good luck!"

It's a pretty reliable commute time.  There was a single drive home that took 2 hours this winter. All other trips have been less than 80 min.  ""Traffic"" seems to mean 45-55 mph for a mile on the freeway to people here. That's not real traffic. There's rarely real traffic in Colorado. I came from Atlanta and rush hour here is a breeze. Coming from NYC, you'll likely feel the same way.  At first I loved the commute. The mountains, the effortless driving, the trains hauling either coal or wind turbines, etc. After 6 months? It's old. I'm sick of losing 2 hours of my day, every day."

ColoradoSprings,39z1em,ShaneC80,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:16:04 2015 UTC,I put in a Rockford Fosgate R600X5 Prime 5-channel amp.
ColoradoSprings,39z1em,ShaneC80,2,Mon Jun 15 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"Odd, but maybe not bad.  The 5 channel sub is likely a good thing.    My suspicion then is that the gains just aren't balanced very well.  This is hard for me to say much about without looking at all the equipment, but....  There should be a few adjustments on the amp itself.  Generally speaking I found that you never want any gain turned more than 3/4s of the way up.  Anything above 3/4s will start distorting and clipping.  So I'd start by setting any settings on the stereo itself to 0.  A flat Equalizer if you will.     Then, set the gains on the amp to about 3/4s.  Actually, turn the sub off for this.  Pop in a good quality CD.  Even if it's a track you normally don't like.  A high quality rip of Hotel California from Hell Freezes over is a great one because of the recording quality.  Play it.  Over and over.  Tweak the amp until it sounds good.  Start with the front speakers.  You normally don't sit in the back of your car do you?  Then tweak the sub to fit the feel of the fronts.  Good?  Good.  Now bring in the rears as a filler.  That was my usual method anyway."
ColoradoSprings,39z1em,ShaneC80,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:52:24 2015 UTC,"Ok. Guess I'll have to pull out the manual and play around with the settings on the amp.  Why do you say it's odd, though?"
ColoradoSprings,39z1em,weauxbreaux,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Just odd that you're not getting good sound
ColoradoSprings,39z1em,weauxbreaux,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"they did mention that some of the songs on my iPod were too compressed. Is that really it? Has my setup become so good that now the file quality has become the limiting factor?   There is a lot of truth in this statement. As you get into higher quality audio, your source quality becomes more and more important. My friend and I have spent a lot of time playing with this with our systems (mid to high end home audio; various car audio). We have found that YES - low quality MP3 sound worse and worse as your system gets bigger and bigger. Running an iPod via AUX cable is far worse than playing MP3s through a USB input. The closer you get to lossless, the better things will sound (MP3 < CD/FLAC < HDCD < SA-CD).  An easy test would be to get a CD of the same songs you are having issues with, and test that out. (Not a CD burned from MP3 rips, but a retail one).   Another would be to test MP3 quality against each other. Take a CD, rip a track at 128k, then rip the same track at 320k. Listen to each through the system, and hear the difference for yourself.  I would also be curious about the amplification question ShaneC80 asked. Did you simply replace the speakers and connect them to the stock head unit? Bad move. You want your new speakers amplified correctly. A new head unit with more/cleaner wattage will make a difference here, but it is best to skip all that and use an amp just for your speakers.   To keep your head unit, you want a digital signal processor: head unit -> DSP -> Amp(s) -> Speakers & Sub  If you upgrade the head unit, you can skip the DSP, and go straight from your preamp out to your amp."

ColoradoSprings,39vqez,DjGhettoSteve,3,Mon Jun 15 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of variables in this story that I want to know but aren't ever explained. Did the cat they allegedly killed come into their yard or did it happen elsewhere and the shaky eye-witness testimony is the PPHS's evidence they were loose?  And while we're on the subject of cats, if a cat owner lets their pet outside unsupervised and completely free to roam, do they forfeit any recourse if the cat is injured or killed (by other animals, accidents, or humans [animal cruelty aside])?"
ColoradoSprings,39vqez,Mediocre_Dane,6,Mon Jun 15 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"To date, McAdam has racked up around $6,000 in legal bills (despite her attorney doing some work pro bono) and $2,500 in boarding costs.  She has also spent more than $1,000 on the cat autopsy, the behavioral assessment, court-ordered training costs and other expenses.  The district attorney prosecuting the case wouldn’t comment, but the Pike’s Peak Regional Humane Society seemed to have little sympathy.  “There’s always ways for people to come up with the money to do this,” president Jan McHugh-Smith told CNN.  Yet dog owners across the country are finding themselves in similar situations, facing huge bills over small pet-related violations like a pet getting loose in the neighborhood or a dog barking too much.  Some are even facing arrest when they can’t pay up.  A CNNMoney analysis of arrest warrants from a sampling of 15 cities and counties found thousands of outstanding warrants stemming from offenses like this.  Other owners have had their dogs killed when they couldn’t afford the fines and fees to get them back from animal control.   http://fox13now.com/2015/06/03/doggie-death-penalty-pay-thousands-or-risk-your-pets-lives/"
ColoradoSprings,39vqez,chamaelleon,-8,Mon Jun 15 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yet dog owners across the country are finding themselves in similar situations, facing huge bills over small pet-related violations like a pet getting loose in the neighborhood or a dog barking too much.   These are not small violations. Especially because what people have most in Springs are guard dogs. A dog getting lose means a good chance of someone getting bitten. I've already had dogs launch themselves at me several times since moving to Pueblo, and Springs isn't much better on the dog issue.  Don't get me wrong. I love dogs, and have been a frequent caretaker and friend to them. I don't think they're all vicious, but a person can't always tell by behavior if a given dog is vicious, so if it's loose on the street, that presents a significant chance for danger due to negligence. In cities at least, there's a reasonable expectation of not encountering many dangerous animals (other than humans), so it's reasonable to enforce against people negligently allowing that. In rural areas, I'd say that expectation doesn't exist, so it should be different there.   The barking is also not a minor issue. It's an enormous and constant auditory assault. For people with sensitive ears, walking down the street can be very painful, and sleeping can be nearly impossible without earplugs, which means you're missing your alarm in the morning, or you aren't sleeping at all. That's not acceptable. There needs to be a crackdown in both issues, especially the latter one, imo."
ColoradoSprings,39vqez,SlowFoodCannibal,-1,Mon Jun 15 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, the barking is a ""constant auditory assault"".  Not only is it totally offensive to neighbors, it's often cruel to the dogs. They're not barking because they're happy, they're barking because they're unhappy: their needs are not being met, they want to get in, they are forced to ""protect"" the property from a constant stream of traffic that just triggers them to get upset over and over.  The sound of many of these dogs is the sound of dogs in distress and it upsets me, as a dog lover, to hear them."
ColoradoSprings,39vqez,Violated_Pee_Holes,-4,Mon Jun 15 20:09:46 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're getting downvoted and I totally agree with you about the auditory assault.

ColoradoSprings,39vqez,chamaelleon,0,Mon Jun 15 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe people got the impression that I don't like dogs. I edited in a caveat. I love dogs; I just think they need to be cared for responsibly, and that in a dense city, people need to consider training them not to bark excessively if they are loud.   It hurts; it's painful (you know what I'm talkin' about, I'm just saying it for whoever else might be reading). And that's not necessary, if people have some consideration.   And if they don't, I believe they forfeit the right to have dogs. At least in cities, where there's a reasonable expectation of not encountering dangerous animals (other than humans), and where noise pollution is already often at disruptive levels."

Dogs are an enormous issue in Springs and Pueblo both. They're always running around stray, and they bark all. fucking. day. long. If you're a light sleeper, you will have to use earplugs to get any sleep in either city.   That's a problem that needs to be addressed. And I'd wager they've tried it the nice way already."

Manitou is good for the penny arcade and stores but it has a huge number of people who like to harass you and it floods a lot now. Buying weed is a personal choice but I wouldn't suggest it because supporting that industry is really having a negative effect on the underage people in this city (and state I would guess). I know a school district admin and she has told me the amount of drug use in our schools seems to have increased, as juveniles are buying drugs from people who obtain them at dispensaries (at least according to student who have whether confessed or been caught). Drug use is only getting worse and I don't think that questionable legislation is going to be consequence free whether or not people like to accept it, which is why I, at least, don't support it by using them."

As a recent high school grad, weed is becoming bigger...But I'd say it's not any different than before legalization.  In fact, I'm all for legalization, despite the fact that I haven't smoked before.  People are going to get their marijuana whether it's legal or not.  The same goes for those who are under age.  You can make the most of the situation and tax it, therefore gaining sone revenue in the process.  It's really a non issue.  The people who smoke will smoke, kids included; on the other hand, people who don't smoke still won't smoke.  Oh, and manitou doesn't flood that often.  It's happened a couple times since the Waldo Canyon fire, but recent mitigation efforts seem to have effectively thwarted the risk, especially considering the recent rainfall."
ColoradoSprings,39u3af,coloradoguy97,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that few issues anger people as much of this. In no way am I trying to be an asshole, i'm just stating my opinion, and that I don't support what is happening. I just know for a fact that a great deal of the marijuana use in high school is now fed by dispensed marijuana. There is no way to prove this except the connections I have with people who have and or do buy and sell marijuana in colorado springs. I have other reasons to dislike it too; many smokers are not equipped with the best judgement, and of course the smoke smells disgusting and causes me a lot of discomfort because of my lung condition. Thus I do not condone encouraging people to do drugs in my home city. Sorry this angers you."
ColoradoSprings,39u3af,R4PTUR3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I guess I just read you a bit wrong, but the asshole was more about manitou than the weed.  Either way, kids I knew were getting their weed even before legalization.  I guess it actually makes it safer for them, since it comes from a reputable source instead of being cut or laced with something to make it cheaper.  In addition to tax revenue, I'd say it's a decent trade-off"

ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,PM_ME_UR_ARMPIT,8,Fri Jun 12 14:18:37 2015 UTC,As a spouse I looked into driving for Uber and Lyft - both deemed me ineligible due to out of state drivers license. Also USAA isn't too keen on the idea so it was a non-starter for me. FWIW.
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,MonsterAtEndOfBook,6,Fri Jun 12 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"I use Lyft in the Springs fairly often. Competition is good, I guess."
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,ploden,3,Fri Jun 12 19:46:35 2015 UTC,Another most-Lyft (sometimes Uber) user here. It's pretty fantastic!
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,shanedn,3,Fri Jun 12 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that Uber operated in the Springs. I started using them in Phoenix this past April and their site didn't have them listed operating outside of Denver.  I used Yellow Cab in the Springs for over a decade and, it works I guess? Wait times were usually pretty lengthy and having to talk to a dispatcher feels like an unnecessary middle step compared to Uber (or Lyft, whichever you prefer). I actually used Curb (Taxi Magic at the time) and it was a step in the right direction, but you still didn't have very accurate GPS tracking (it only updated every couple minutes or so) and it wasn't quite as seamless as Uber, either. On top of that, Yellow Cabbies were never the friendliest bunch. Uber drivers rely on that star-rating for their rep and job performance, so they're always trying to be nice, even offering to change the radio station when I get in. The cabbies I knew just got what they were dealt and that was it.  So, more Uber is more better!"
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,NtheLegend,2,Fri Jun 12 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never knew they were in the springs either, but apparently it is and I'm glad they're going to expand even more. I'd much rather just pull up an app and get an Uber then call a cab. Plus it's cheaper."

ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,xthorgoldx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:53:16 2015 UTC,It's insane. There is already too many drivers during normal hours which means that for the most part I can only make money by driving to Denver and working there.
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,lanismycousin,5,Sat Jun 13 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"Being a semi-regular users, ""too many drivers"" is not the issue from consumer side."
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,xthorgoldx,0,Sat Jun 13 19:44:37 2015 UTC,There are times when there are too few drivers for the demand (right around last call usually) but for the most part there really isn't many other times that I am getting constant calls for pickups. Even on supposedly busy days (friday/saturday) I can sometimes go hours without getting a single ping and it's not like I am hanging out in the boonies.   Which is why I have been driving in the denver area a whole lot more than here. I make more money that way.
ColoradoSprings,39l4mj,lanismycousin,2,Sun Jun 14 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just because I'm always looking for rides near Monument and in Manitou as opposed to downtown, but I never seem to be in pickup range."

ColoradoSprings,39lwia,ASquirrelNamedLloyd,2,Tue Jun 16 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'd check your age, because it might be a generation thing. Then probably not be too surprised, because it's an ""Old Fashioned"", not a trendy drink like a Cosmo or an easily identified Rum and Coke lol. Also, I'd imagine you're not a bartender, and it's not your job to know drinks. It's an alcoholic drink, involves getting a sugar cube and mashing it up, orange (or lemon) and a cherry. It's and older drink, distinguished and for me, a fighting drink. Still, the surprise is that the person running the bar would say they never heard of it (unlikely). The likelier reason they'd say they don't know how to make it is laziness (could probably look it up with a little effort) and it's a process for sure to make, or lack of appropriate ingredients. Those are both valid reasons. But being a bartender in a joint like that, and saying you don't know? I find than hard to believe on the bartender's side."

ColoradoSprings,39n51s,AnOrangeKiwi,2,Fri Jun 12 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"You will find at least 25d/5u throughout the city and suburbs. Moderately modern areas get at least 50d/10u (what I have). My apartment just got upgraded so they're offering 75d, 150d, and 250d packages as well (not sure about upload). CenturyLink maxes out at 40d/20u for me and they've come to my door several times this year trying to sell me on it... but occasionally they have 100d service throughout the city.  Keep in mind that actual speeds seem to vary wildly for both providers. I generally don't have any problems (I get 40+ down usually but it's not a big deal) but you'll hear horror stories about Comcast here if you're in a less-than-well-cared-for area. We have a dedicated Comcast dude that gets an earful if we have problems, so we're safe, but you never know. I had a problem where I got 50-100% packet loss for a week and nobody could figure it out (India tech, local tech, ""Comcast dude"", even myself) until it just magically resolved itself.  You can always poke around the Comcast and CenturyLink sites for quoted speeds though (put in some addresses and see what you get).  Final note - the M&A world is going nuts over the spate of merger proposals between ISPs, so don't get your panties twisted over sticking to CenturyLink because they might get bought out by the big two anyway."

Go up to the counter and tell them basically what you said here: MtG looks amazing, I want to try it out, but I have no idea where to begin.   They'll take care of you. Probably start you off with an event deck, recommend some sleeves and a play mat, and you'll be all set to start playing.    If you fall in with a group there, and they're showing you the roaps, you can be cool like, ""Hey I'm gonna go get a drink, (they sell beer at Enchanted Realms) any of you guys want anything?""  You know, basically offer to buy a round.   If you get really tight, you can order pizza or similar.   You don't have to do those things, I'm just sayin you can if you want, if the opportunity arises organically, in lieu of your offer to buy someone dinner.   After that, just show up either whenever looking for pickup games, or in Friday evenings for Friday night magic (aka ""FNM"") and you'll just kinda get into it, assuming you like it.   Oh, check out starcitygames.com for deck builds and to find magic in your area. For buying cards online, pretty much the de facto site is tcgplayer.com.   Other than that, yeah man just show up and express your interest and they should take care of you. Really to get started all you need is an event deck, some sleeves, and a playmat.

A beginner's guide? Hmm. I don't really have anything there, as you said might be the case.  If you google one like you said you will, that's cool; make sure they explain basic turn mechanics, and when priority passes, and most importantly, ""the stack"".   After you have a few games under your belt, you'll want to move on to more ""advanced"" topics such as ""who's the beat down"" and stuff like that.  I am a very novice player myself, so, take this all with a grain of salt; the game is immense. I've been playing for about a year now, and you could just about cram what I don't know about the game into the grand fucking canyon; I've barely scratched the surface.

ColoradoSprings,397ive,DatBurn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:54:47 2015 UTC,Curious how you convinced the police to consider it stolen after you gave permission.  Generally the police don't get involved in a CIVIL matter (it isn't a criminal matter if you have any permission).

ColoradoSprings,3981cp,Drive_Monkey_Drive,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:46:01 2015 UTC,I agree westside as well. I live over there and love it!  Houses/Apts can be a bit older but you can definitely get something very decent with good space for $1200. Tons of hiking and biking in the area as well.  You will find newer homes and apartments up north...Briargate etc. However it can be a bit suburbia-ish with new families. Nothing wrong with that but it doesn't sound like that is what you guys are looking for.  Not much going on for nightlife in the springs. Old colorado city has some good chill bars where you can actually hold a conversation.  Downtown will have a huge influx of military on Friday Saturday nights and the bars can tend to be loud dance type bars. Again nothing wrong with either! Its all personal preference.   Lastly it can be hard to meet people in that age group... Mid 20s here as well. Once you guys get into town shoot me a PM if you want to grab a drink or have a smoke.   Best of luck!
ColoradoSprings,3981cp,SidSuicide,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:12:25 2015 UTC,"Southwestern, Colorado Springs / Old Colorado City / Downtown / Manitou are all good.  It's far removed from a lot of the religious creepers, a little bit of a military mix, and all close to things.  $1200 is probably the perfect budget for the area too.  That's around the price of BAH (housing allowance from military), last I checked, which is the basis for a lot of the rent out here.  Property owners want the military people to be able to afford their housing and live off base in their rental properties."

CS is by no means a big city. The vast majority of it has the same feel as Anytown, USA. I've been here for a few years and can't really nail down an obvious feel to the place and its people. We've got a little of everything - west coast youngsters, east coast snobs, southern cowboys, mountain hippies, midwest folk. It's just a big area confused as to what it wants to be.  That's not to say it's bad. If you want a taste of everything, it's here. I've met people from all over the country living here for one reason or another. (Although it's strangely white-bread overall - the population is somewhere around 90% white, so not a lot of diversity.)  I was told a long time ago that Colorado accepts anyone. It's (mostly) true. You can be a boring asshole (me), or an exciting extrovert and you will find a place somewhere in CO.  That said, there are a few drawbacks to the Springs. Again, it's a city with a sort of generally American feel, so you're not gonna have a whole lot to do if you don't like to eat and shop (hiking notwithstanding). On that note, if you don't like hiking, prepare to turn down a lot of social offers to do so, because it seems like everyone here does. The job market is also pretty dead, but that translates into cheap cost of living, so take that as you will. Our government is garbage, so while there is no public transport and roads are awful, cops don't give a fuck if you speed a bit because they're grossly understaffed and have better things to do.  If the only reason you're considering the Springs is the outdoors, consider Boulder instead. It's right next to Denver and probably more urbanized. If you don't care about the outdoors, just go to Denver. Otherwise, welcome."

The male to female ratio in Colorado Springs is really off due to the fact that there are five military bases in Colorado Springs.  Nightlife is not good out here if you are looking to meet women.  You'll be competing with 10 soldiers for the favor of a fat ugly woman.  It is hard to meet women in this town."

I should actually head back out there soon
ColoradoSprings,392vrn,khaymus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:25:40 2015 UTC,How much is it?
ColoradoSprings,392vrn,Halog,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"The prices and schedule are very flexible.  The one I was looking at was meeting once a week for 60 mins for 24 weeks.  This would cost 2 students 480$ a piece.  I was hoping to find someone to do this with, so we could meet on our own outside of class another day for 60 mins.  So essentially, 24 weeks, meeting two times a week (once with a teacher and once as a study group) for 480$.  So pushing this out to a year (assuming we stick with it), it would be nearly 1000$ for a full year of twice a week meetings.  If you stick with a language for a year, meeting twice a week, I would think we would be pretty strong at the language!"

I worked at a Costco with top 5 NE highest revenue for like 2 yrs.  Some highlights:  - yearly union dues (not required, but strongly encouraged) - worked till you drop.  I worked in almost all areas (food court, front end, photo, stocker).   Good experience to learn about processes, have many opportunities at multiple departments. - pay is good. But you earn every cent. Literally no downtime. -  hours are pretty flexible but i had cool supervisors.  - i got treated well by supervisors.  I had many one on one talks with the regional managers that applied my business college knowledge. - you get to see a diverse crowd of ppl in varying stages of their lives. - best of all, free membership.  Edit i didn't take healthcare bcz was still under parents."

Don't staff enough people, expect the others to pick up all that extra slack, encourage you not to do college to be a full time employee (screw my future right?), schedule you when you have gotten permission not to work, encourage you to ask for help then write you up when you do.

ColoradoSprings,394j54,FlipQuarters,2,Tue Jun 9 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"This map is pretty general, but startlingly accurate for what it is.   Heed the red, OP, unless you're used to an urban-style interface with police and crime in general. My wife and I just looked at a house situated in that little spike of red along Academy Blvd, and there had been multiple assaults and forced-entry break ins on that block in the last month alone.   Everywhere else is pretty nice. My only gripe with the map is downtown around CC should have it's own color, since it's nice and there are some incredible lofts, just a pretty benign vagrant/druggy population that gives it a bad reputation."
ColoradoSprings,394j54,MisterKlaw,2,Tue Jun 9 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not incredibly specific in that sense. The CC area is actually all right. But if OP doesn't have personal experience or more specific advice to know where inside the red is ok, best to just steer clear."

They protect from surges as rated, but with lightning all bets are off. It does what it wants. Some damage may not even show up for a month or more. Better to just unplug if you are concerned."
ColoradoSprings,38yw5h,flickerfly,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:19:36 2015 UTC,"Can confirm! Lightning strike has so much energy (joules) that it can easily kill the surge protector and anything connected. In fact, it can fry your wiring in your house. They make electrical arrestors big enough to protect from lightning but the average consumer can't afford it.   Best thing to do is unplug if you know a large storm is coming.   As for their purpose; as mentioned here already, they are meant to protect from rolling surges in the power grid."

There's plenty of new/newer development across I-25 from AFA that I imagine is relatively cheap. You'll have no trouble finding something between the Baptist and Briargate exits. Your google is as good as mine when it comes to pricing.  I'd consider living closer to downtown and Old Colorado City. The area around AFA is pretty much sleepy suburbia. It's probably 15 minutes from downtown to AFA's South entrance."
ColoradoSprings,38p6z5,raiderato,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:48:23 2015 UTC,I second that about downtown and OCC. Such nice places and near to the highway so not really that long a commute.
ColoradoSprings,38p6z5,StephenDedalus1904,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:09:07 2015 UTC,Look for a house in Briargate. Close to academy and best school districts. You can probably find a fixer upper for 160k.

It'd be an hour commute from the southern edge of downtown Denver, traffic-free once you get past 225 (DTC). I make the drive into Denver from CS daily and it's starting to wear on me. 2 hours of every day disappear. 2 hours that I could spend doing anything else... The drive is easy, good view, fast speeds, but it just gets old. It took about 6 months for me to despise it.  160k isn't going to go nearly as far in Denver as CS."
ColoradoSprings,38p6z5,nonspecificwife,2,Fri Jun 5 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"The commute to Denver is at least an hour but worse if you get stuck in rush hour, bad weather, or just a bad traffic day. Monument hill alone can take 30+ minutes on a bad day. And while you can live somewhere decent in the Springs for $160k, in Denver you will be stuck in either a bad neighborhood or the world's smallest condo."
ColoradoSprings,38p6z5,nonspecificwife,2,Fri Jun 5 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yikes. So sticking with The Springs is the best bet. Guess I could socialize in Denver. I'd rather not have a giant commute, considering half the year it's in snow."
ColoradoSprings,38p6z5,raiderato,3,Sat Jun 6 03:17:46 2015 UTC,Here's a secret...We don't get that much snow and when we do it generally melts in a day. There have been a few stretches of extended cold weather but it's generally not that bad.   I would definitely recommend staying down here versus living in Denver though.

Last year there was a big storm on the 22nd, and this year it was on the 7th and lasted for a few days. This is what this year's storm did, but it melted away by the next day.  Depending on where you live, it can range from minor damage (my car only got scuffed in two or three spots, no glass damage) to pretty heavy (smashed windshields, ruined roofs, flooding).  I don't know anyone who actually takes preventative measures; usually it comes without much warning anyway. I was at a friend's house when it started and we heard it announced on the weather channel; about 30 seconds later, it was chaos outside.  Outside that, any hail we get is small and very brief. If it concerns you that much, you could maybe keep a tarp handy... but I wouldn't lose sleep over it."

I've always left reviews and it's gotten me out of a couple sticky situations with my apts being destroyed by dogs.  Would've had a hefty bill but I voluntarily left a great review on yelp etc with my real name and they personally came to me to thank me.    Not saying to do it for personal kickback  though.  That's just a benefit.  It's a good thing to do.  If I'm impressed with a restaurant I get out yelp to yell it to the world.

ColoradoSprings,388o8b,ASquirrelNamedLloyd,8,Tue Jun 2 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"I paste my copypasta to yelp every so months because this gets asked so often, so here you go.  ""I'm a Springs native, but spent my summers in New Mexico.  We are void of tasty Mexican for some awful reason.  However, there are a few bright spots in town if you know where to look.  1)  El Taco Rey (lunch only) - Downtown  One thing on the menu to order, the pork avocado burrito.  Taste wise, they have the best green chili in town, but it's lacking in heat.   If you want the knock off and don't want to fight the lines at El Taco Rey head over to the SW part of downtown to Salsa Latina.  Near identical menu, not quite as good or quite as friendly.  2) Quijotes - Way cheap, way better than it has any business being for their prices.  Best carnitas in town.  Everything on the menu is tasty, even the ceviche appetizer.  3)   We loved La Perla too, sad to see it go  4)  Fiesta Jalisco - Everytime we eat here we say to ourselves ""Damn, just that close to being spectacular""  The food is always good, and the service is great.  Solid restaurant.    5)  Carlos Miguels - This seems to be my most contentious pick.  People other love it or hate it.  I order one thing off the menu: the Chimichanga Puerto Vallarta.  It's a seafood chimi covered in a delicious habanero cream sauce.  6) We tried Pueblo Viejo again and it was solid the 2nd time around.  Nothing blows you away, but came away satisfied.  7) Greasy awesome bachelor food taco - Monica's / Taco Express shredded beef tacos.  Best taken to go with a 6 pack of Mexican lager.  (I prefer Pacifico)  8)  Fish tacos/burrito - Give Laau's by CC a try.  It's a once a month stop for work lunches.  I usually go with the build your own shrimp burrito, but love their ingredients.     9)  It's cheating, but head north to Castle Rock and go to Santiago's.  Best green chili in the state.  Everything is tasty, just drown in it the chili.  It's sit down fast food that blows away most established mexican restaurants."""
ColoradoSprings,388o8b,doitforthepeople,2,Tue Jun 2 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes! to Santiago's. I've never had anything like it. Their Green Chili is on another plane. The way it's thick, spicy and the chunks of meat aren't too big, but still there, is second to none.   Beef and bean burrito, smothered deluxe with sour cream and guacamole is the way to go. Get a nacho plate and chips and salsa to dunk in the left over green chile mess. I really dig their no frills salsa as well.  I'm surprised they haven't moved further south. I'm guessing the Springs isn't ready."

There's one on B Street about a half-mile outside Fort Carson, and there's another one up around Peterson AFB's north side.  Monica's Taco Shop, also up near Peterson's north side, is also quite good, but they have all of about four seats for customers.  As for a more sit-down-restaurant place with waiters and such, there's a place my wife loves that we've been once or twice, but I can't remember the name. When I get home in an hour or two, I'll ask her about it and come update this.  EDIT: Carlos Miguel's, was the sit-down place. Good food."

A small, local Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve your typical meals (#4, three enchiladas, #7 a tamale and a taco).  But, if you go, you have to get a pork avacado burrito (with or without green Chile). It is far and away the best item on their menu."

If you aren't getting light-headed, nauseated, etc, then that's the first (major) step.

ColoradoSprings,380fe1,weauxbreaux,5,Mon Jun 1 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"If you had multiple road rage incidents in a 3 day span, there has got to be something up with your driving. I would evaluate what got you into those situations.   I've been driving here for 16 years and have never been in a violent confrontation on the roads. I've seen my share of aggressive / idiot drivers, but I choose to not escalate the situation, or entertain the other driver if they want to escalate.  Not trying to be an ass, and I'm all for firearm ownership - but carrying a gun to protect yourself from road rage doesn't sound like a great idea to me. Worry more about learning to avoid conflict with other drivers. Keep in mind that you are not going to be the only guy out there with a pistol in the glove box. If you step out of your car with a pistol, you have given the other guy a license to shoot you 'in self-defense' (and they will walk). Keep in mind there are people out there who are out there just looking for an excuse to shoot someone.    I've been looking into the carry laws here in CO....not too interested in ccw....open carry doesn't require a license, if I'm reading the highway patrol website correctly.   Correct, and here is a bit more info:  Open carry - no permit required.   Concealed carry in your car, house, or business: no permit required.   You can carry a pistol, loaded & concealed anywhere in your car (you can bolt a holster under your steering wheel if you want). A rifle or shotgun may be loaded, but with no rounds in the chamber.   Concealed carry anywhere else (including between your house and car): permit required.   Interestingly enough, carrying a firearm illegally concealed is less of a crime than carrying brass knuckles; I've got a number of friends who have been let off by police with warning to ""go get your permit""."
ColoradoSprings,380fe1,sparkus1,2,Mon Jun 1 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with what your saying, and it does sound like I'm the one with the driving problem, but both of these were issues that I thought were pretty harmless anywhere else...the first happened when another guy ran a stop sign in front of me and I pointed at the stop sign, and the second happened when a little girl ran out in front of me in a parking lot...I stopped both times without slamming on the brakes, so I obviously wasn't speeding...the other people just reacted a lot more aggresively than my wife and I have seen in other places.  It kind of rattled us is all."

Five years in the danger zone and I've yet to feel the need to carry a weapon. I do have an alarm system on the house, but I'd have one regardless of where in town I live."
ColoradoSprings,380fe1,kbuechl,2,Mon Jun 1 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"I personally would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it, since you are military the ccw process is pretty simple I believe (I just moved to co from Ohio and there if you are military or honorably discharged you can just set up an appointment and pay the money and get a conceal carry lisence), assuming you don't already have it. I would suggest having it with you all the time not just in the car.  What gun in particular comes down to personal preference. Make sure you get extremely familiar with it and try to rent the one you want before you buy it. First you need to decide between revolver or semi automatic. After that you need to figure out what size you like. I definitely suggest not getting something very bulky, my first pistol I bought is what I carry and it is huge. With shorter barrel and you sacrifice accuracy so you need to find a good mix of both. Many people argue that since most altercations happen with him a couple of feet and 21 feet is often the limit for anyone with a night if you are going to defend yourself legally do you want to be able to be spot on at least that far. If you are very familiar with the Beretta m9 that is a great gun. One of my best friends is a federal agent and that is what he carries everywhere. Don't get less than a 9mm with whatever you do."

ColoradoSprings,380fe1,GangstaBroMaster,3,Mon Jun 1 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"Open carry does not require a permit, this is correct.   Edit: I was wrong about carrying in vehicles..   https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/csp/colorado-gun-laws   Title 18:  Colorado allows a person to carry a firearm in a vehicle if its use is for lawful protection of such person or another's person or property. [C.R.S. 18-12-105(2)] Colorado law also allows a person to possess a handgun in a dwelling, place of business, or automobile. However, when you carry the weapon into your home, business, hotel room, etc. it must be in plain view. Local jurisdictions may not enact laws that restrict a person's ability to travel with a weapon. [C.R.S. 18-12-105.6] The Act permits the nationwide carrying of concealed handguns by qualified current and retired law enforcement officers and amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213) to exempt qualified current and retired law enforcement officers from state and local laws prohibiting the carry of concealed firearms.   I know other states do not have the same feelings on this so if you are gonna leave the state with a pistol on you in the vehicle I would suggest looking into those states or getting a ccw. Honestly I think the ccw laws in co are great, much better than Ohio for sure but to each his own"
ColoradoSprings,380fe1,vibeee,2,Mon Jun 1 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"Even though it's legal, be careful with how you open carry. People will still call the cops on you. Most likely they wouldn't give you a ticket but say you were in an argument with someone, possibly can try to get you for menacing. If we were talking more ho dunk like canon I feel like you wouldn't have issues but places like springs and pueblo you might run into trouble. And don't even try in Denver, you will for sure get arrested. I've heard ccw permit holders get arrested in Denver and fined so can only imagine that would be the same for open. Concealing a gun in the car doesn't count as concealed carry either so you do not need a permit for that if you are only scared about road rage.   Colorado Springs seems like one of the safer places I've ever lived though."

Message me if you want to check out willows as we can both get the referral bonus from it if you do Lol and I could use some friends, just moved to the springs a few weeks ago.  Apartmentguide.com was very useful for me when I was searching in the area.

Click on any trail to see a zoomed - in version.   Congrats! For a young person who has more interest in the outdoors and cycling than nightlife, you have won the city lottery! I firmly believe that Colorado Springs is one of the best places in the nation, if you are an outdoorsy type person and/or competitive in a sport such as cycling or running. The urban trails in Colorado Springs are all multi-use and connect all of the major parks as well as most of the nneighborhoods in the city.   Many endurance athletes make Colorado Springs their home due to the high elevation and (primarily) the proximity to the mountains.   As far as neighborhoods, as someone mentioned, the Greenway is our ""spine"" trail, but most other urban trails connect to it at some point. Really, I'd suggest looking at anything within your price range, and see what areas you like best. Even the poorer neighborhoods do have redeeming qualities..."
ColoradoSprings,37x4ok,FourteenThousand,2,Sun May 31 11:41:48 2015 UTC,"$900/mo in rent should net you a decent place. Heck, you could rent a small bungalow/house on the west end for that much.  Bicycling is huge here, you'll like it a lot. There aren't a massive amount of paved* trails compared to Denver, but still a lot and you can get around fairly easily on them.  Drink a lot of water, the altitude and dryness (can I even claim that anymore?) will seriously dehydrate you.  Ignore a lot of the bashing you hear about the Springs. The bulk of it is complete nonsense, especially when it comes to religion. Are most people here religious? Sure. Nobody will ever really ask or tell you about it though.  Some stereotypes ARE true. There are 4 major military bases around town (5 if you count NORAD, but they've moved most of their operations to Peterson AFB) which is a lot for a city of half a million people. Nearly everyone you run into will either be military, married to military, or employed by military. So don't be surprised.  This also means that there are a LOT of guns here. It's not a bad thing, but may be a serious culture shock for an east coaster that pretty much everyone has a few guns in their house and may even nonchalantly have a pistol strapped to their hip while walking around the grocery store.  Another culture shock may be the friendliness of people here. I know it sounds odd, but I've known New Yorkers who moved here and get weirded the fuck out by the fact that it's normal for everyone to say ""good morning"" if they catch your eye contact. Elevators? You bet your ass you're gonna be engaged in idle small talk with a stranger in them.  Hope you enjoy it here, I think you will based on your description.  Also you may want to invest in a Subaru. The AWD isn't absolutely needed, but is awfully nice to have a couple times a year.  *EDIT: added ""paved"" since I think the Springs probably has way more miles of mountain bike trails around town."

I honestly can't say too much since I haven't really explored much near downtown. But I lived at those Encore apartments off I-25 and Rockrimmon. I don't recommend it there, especially for the price. I bought my house in the teal area on the map at the very east edge, so I can say the area there is very nice. I'd say the map tends to be pretty accurate in terms of housing that you'll find. Steer clear of living too close to downtown, so I've heard. Always some talk about crime, shootings, muggings, etc. I can't imagine it's that bad, but I think since it's always hitting the news, it sounds way worse than it actually is.

ColoradoSprings,37qzuf,ASquirrelNamedLloyd,2,Fri May 29 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, but I don't think this a good question to ask the community.  There are a couple free clinics and stuff, but I wouldn't necessarily call those doctors ""good"".   Once, when I was young, one misdiagnosed me by casually saying I had a heart murmur, then after I was visibly shaken about it, left the room. Sure, not her problem, necessarily, and certainly not the worst diagnosis, but my problem with it is she showed no empathy and did not consider the source (I was 18 at the time, cmon, that's a child). Lack of bedside manner puts that staff, in the ""not good"" list for me.  On the contrary, when I did have insurance, I had a wonderful cosmetic surgeon, a lovely dentist, and a wonderful psychiatrist. Not so good luck with primary doctors.   If you want to know specifics of any of these other specialists, inbox me."

As I'm into gaming most of those groups I know of hang out at the game stores. Enchanted Realms regularly holds board game nights and other events. I've never been to one of their events (too damn busy) but I do frequent the store- Great people and place. If you like board games at all I'd start there!  I also know there are a few hiking clubs/groups in the area. You could try hooking up with one of them.

ColoradoSprings,37luiz,kbuechl,1 point,Thu May 28 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely would prefer a house with a yard. 2 bed room ok, max 1200. I don't know much about springs but I'll be working and going to college. Would love to live on the west side closer to the range but really anywhere is fine"
ColoradoSprings,37luiz,kbuechl,1 point,Thu May 28 18:52:21 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late reply. I went with an apartment so I might not be much help. I would suggest talking with a realtor. How long are you planning on staying in the springs? For 1200 a month you could probably buy a pretty decent house. Sorry I'm not much more help if you're looking for an apartment I could give you a million places to look at. I found a few months ago that Craigslist was not a great option because it did not have many pet friendly rentals. If you do find a good place though make sure you visit Bear Creek dog park on the west side of town. It is fantastic and your dog would love it. If you see a big dumb German Shepherd who looks like he wants to play but never plays come talk to me lol

ColoradoSprings,37f1bu,Shariq1989,2,Wed May 27 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that I know military spouses, wives in particular, get a bad reputation because of the behaviors of a few. I've met just as many spouses that hold their own careers and have their own lives and hobbies as spouses that identify far too much with their SO's job. There are some who will latch on to their SO's title and try to harness some sense of significance from it and some who won't know how to reach out and create a social network outside their spouse and I think these ladies often get labeled the same way (""dependas"" or whatever people say now) even though they're not the same at all. I personally think the majority are cool, laid back chicks.   Anyway, the point I was trying to make, but kind of wandered away from, is that if your SIL approaches the FRG she could have a great experience like before or she could enter into a very political FRG where spouses take SOs' ranks far too seriously. Just as a word of caution, it can be a very weird community. I always give them my email and remain friendly but honestly I tend to avoid any events and try to find close friends elsewhere."

The trails through the center have some steeper sections but nothing too steep.  Black Forest Regional Park also has some that might work, but they're all generally steeper.  The Santa Fe trail north of USAFA would fit your description well.  It's wide and generally flat from Baptist road to Palmer Lake and even beyond that going up to the Greenland trail head.  It gets a lot of traffic though, so it depends on how well the dogs handle distractions.  The part north of Palmer Lake going to Greenland is usually a lot less crowded."

If so, you can get into the worst apartments for around $550/month rent. I would probably want to find a group housing situation and rent a room in a house for the same price instead, but it's up to your preference.   The people here are not like folks in Alabama. I lived my whole life in the south, and there are some differences. First off, EVERYONE here is white. Idk you but it makes me a little uncomfortable how whitewashed everything is here. Most people can be friendly (as long as you aren't driving, all drivers here seem to hate other drivers) but don't expect people to just strike up a conversation while you're in line to pay for your groceries. If you talk to random people here, you are as likely to get someone who will be pleasant and talk as you are to get someone who won't.   Cost of living is unremarkable. If you're from a real small town, it might be a little pricier than you're used to; if you're from a big city, it is likely cheaper."

ColoradoSprings,36vqp3,tall_bob,3,Fri May 22 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"Its a pretty solid network in the Springs and all of Denver. Plenty of capacity per user and only a few weird weak spots and buildings where it drops out. If you have a phone that supports their new Band 12 network, you're in luck because this is one of the launch markets and improves the already fairly good in-building coverage here.  Things get more dicey in the mountains but most carriers suck in the mountains. I generally don't care much because I'm out there to hike and enjoy nature and tend to use my phone just for pictures. If I were to need to call 911, it should latch onto AT&T if they have service there.  Just did a speed test in my apartment in Manitou and pulled in 71 down/21 up.

ColoradoSprings,36rtv5,ratatatar,1 point,Thu May 21 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Comcast will happily give you a new introductory rate after the old one expires.  Once a year, I call in complaining because my bill with Internet alone is running at $130, which is way too much and I would absolutely cancel if I had to continuously pay it.  But I never do.  They always drop it back down to $80ish.  I wish they would just give me a sub-$100 rate and forget the hassle of having to continuously ask for a reasonable bill though."
ColoradoSprings,36rtv5,YourMatt,4,Thu May 21 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"I may be the vocal minority, but I've actually been really impressed with Comcast so far. I pay for 50Mbps. However, I always get speeds over 100 Mbps. I ran a speed test right before posting this and am at 125!!!  My Centurylink experience was paying for 20Mbps and receiving speeds of around 10-12. Not to mention the constant downtimes, and having to get a repair done every few months. So overall, I'm actually pleasantly surprised."
ColoradoSprings,36rtv5,c4m320n,6,Thu May 21 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"I'm personally on a 40/20 plan with CenturyLink for $25/month, and it pretty much always runs more like 50/20 which is pretty nice, and far better than Comcast will give me for the price.

ColoradoSprings,36olka,vmir,8,Wed May 20 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"As a fellow eastern European (Slovakia) who spent 4 years in Colorado Springs, few things:  1.) Public transportation is horrendous. This is the city of a size of a decent Eastern European capital (Bratislava for example) with the public transportation system of a city of below 50,000 people in Europe - there are only barely over 20 bus routes, they operate only until early evening (6pm-ish). It will suffice in terms of getting you to whatever place you need to shop at, with 30 minute frequency, it works. Bike will work great.   2.) Phone wise, Cricket is great. I am paying $45 a month, using my own iPhone, I get unlimited text/calls + 5gb of LTE data. Don't think there is much better (at least on GSM, there are great CDMA deals, but whatever)  3.) Get linen and all that sorta stuff at Walmart - it's really the cheapest. The quality is meh, but it shall be good enough for 4 months. Groceries - King Soopers / Safeway, depending on where you live, those are really the only 2 options, haha. Clothes - Kohl's / TJ Maxx / Ross - discount department stores with real brands.   4.) Clothes wise, you should miss winter (doesn't really start till november). It's in 20s here until October, but I would obviously bring fall clothes.  5.) Where are you working / studying? I would adjust my rent answer based on that."

ColoradoSprings,36olka,GangstaBroMaster,5,Thu May 21 06:53:57 2015 UTC,you dont have to worry about crime thats all i'll say.
ColoradoSprings,36olka,OfficerNelson,1 point,Wed May 20 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I don't know why the official crime rate is so high here. I have yet to really see it. There are some sketchy parts of town but nothing compared to big cities. The vast majority of the city is totally safe."
ColoradoSprings,36olka,scarlin,5,Thu May 21 07:22:57 2015 UTC,"Public transportation is not the most efficient way to travel in this city. In fact it is seriously lacking in most areas. A bicycle will be great most of the time, but the city is pretty spread out so going longer distances will be work.  Utilities are going to depend on where you rent. Some place include utilities, but most don't. You'll probably pay between $100 and $200 per month for utilities.  I've used Cricket (prepaid cell) for the last 9 years and I've been very happy with them. For a single phone it runs about $60 per month (plus the cost of a phone).  We have lots of second hand stores in town for furnishing your apartment, but I recommend checking Craigslist for things you need.  Grocery prices are going to be close to the same in all grocery stores, except for Whole Foods which generally has higher quality, fresher produce and their prices reflect that.  As much as I can't stand Wal-Mart, it is the cheapest place to pick up many of the household items that you'll need.  June, July, and August are the hottest months of the year and the temperature can hit 100F. Shorts and a t-shirt are perfect for that weather. September and October will get cooler and you'll want to wear layers with a t-shirt, a button up shirt, and maybe a sweater over that. I usually don't bring a jacket out of the closet until late October.  According to the Wikipedia page Romania is slightly warmer, on average, than Colorado Springs, but the climate should be pretty close to the same overall.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Romania http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/colorado/colorado-springs/  Hope that helps."
ColoradoSprings,36olka,autowikibot,2,Wed May 20 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Climate of Romania:       Because of its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate which ranges from temperate to continental. Climatic conditions are somewhat modified by the country's varied topography. The Carpathians serve as a barrier to Atlantic air masses, limiting their oceanic influences to the west and center of the country (Transilvania, Banat and Maramureș), which have milder winters and heavier rainfalls as a result. The mountains also block the continental influences of the vast plain to the north in the Ukraine, which results in frosty winters and less rain to the south and southeast. In the extreme southeast, Black Sea influences offer a milder, maritime climate. The average annual temperature is 11 °C (51.8 °F) in the south and middle-south and 8 °C (46.4 °F) in northeast. In Bucharest, the temperature ranges from average low −5 °C (23 °F) in January to average high 29 °C (84.2 °F) in July and August, with average temperatures of −3 °C (26.6 °F) in January and 23 °C (73.4 °F) in July and August. Rainfall, although adequate throughout the country, decreases from west to east and from mountains to plains. Some mountainous areas receive more than 1,010 mm (39.8 in) of precipitation each year. Annual precipitation averages about 635 mm (25 in) in central Transylvania, 521 mm (20.5 in) at Iaşi in Moldavia, and only 381 mm (15 in) at Constanţa on the Black Sea.

ColoradoSprings,36olka,Chassney,3,Wed May 20 23:20:09 2015 UTC,Follow this map  For a student with your budget I would recommend Manitou (on the map it's where the hippies live). It's a artsy part of town with plenty to do in walking distance. It's not too far from downtown Colorado Springs either. You could find a unique studio downtown Manitou for around $700.
ColoradoSprings,36olka,Chassney,2,Thu May 21 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"As far as crime, just avoid the here be dragons area if you want to play it super safe. But even in the ""sketchy"" areas there is not much crime, that side of town is just not as nice as the rest of the Springs."
ColoradoSprings,36olka,wreave,5,Thu May 21 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard Colorado Springs is a wonderland but I didn't know that you have dragons. Now I'm even more excited to get there. I've watched a very good documentary called ""How to train your dragon"". I hope I can catch one.  Thank you for your answers!"
ColoradoSprings,36olka,wreave,2,Thu May 21 07:01:10 2015 UTC,"Best place to search for apartment? Probably Craigslist. You will probably have trouble finding something for that duration though. You might have to do a six-month lease beginning on 1 June. $700 seems reasonable. You're going to want to find something between downtown and the Broadmoor. The Broadmoor area itself can be expensive.  Cheapest GSM prepaid plans? Go to Wal-Mart and there are several options. I assume you're wanting to bring your own phone.  Best/cheapest stores for clothes, groceries, and other stuff? Super Wal-Mart or Super Target. There is a Super Wal-Mart on 8th st off Hwy 24 that is close to the Broadmoor. That will get you food and everything you need around the house. They also have clothes. It's certainly a good place to get clothing basics like socks and underwear, and your work clothes. For nicer clothes, like for going out, you will probably want to go to the mall.  A bike is not a bad idea but it will depend on where you live. The Broadmoor is a ways out, i.e. there is nothing by it except its own stuff and a bunch of really really expensive houses. For your purposes it's probably your best best; I doubt you want to deal with trying to buy and then sell a car in four months. There is also a bus system - it isn't great but I would assume it runs out to the Broadmoor.  Crime rate is generally a non issue. Lock up your bike - you probably won't have an expensive one anyway.  Clothes? You will have every kind of weather during that timeframe. July/August it will get up into the 30s from time to time. Every afternoon at 3:00 sharp it will thunderstorm. If you are wearing a watch and it says the thunderstorm started at a different time other that 3:00, your watch is wrong and you should throw it away. September will still be nice but the evenings will be cool. Chances of it snowing at least once before you leave in mid-October are pretty good, but even then most days will have high temperatures over 10. Mostly bring summer clothes with a few fall items.

As someone that has moved around a lot and has been fairly successful at finding positions,  my best suggestion is figuring out how to use GIS alongside a career or grab a second major in CS and learn to program and do some database management. Seriously, everything in the GIS world is moving in an IT direction and it is not enough anymore to be able to do some edits and make nice maps. If you're looking for internships, I always enjoyed working for cities and they will almost always take volunteers if nothing is open (because something on your resume is better than nothing). Look into non-profits, my best paid internship was doing GIS for a non-profit that studied employment trends in the region (And they will also gladly take volunteers).   But really, if you want a career in GIS with upward molbility and not just a job, do yourself a solid and learn to program and learn about databases because the GIS field is very competitive no matter the location."

I'm currently do analytical water chemistry in PA, but my last day is in exactly 2 weeks!   GIS is crazy-awesome. I used it for a majority of my research on all sorts of stuff. All of these were separate research project posters I presented at my school's student project day, and a few I went to larger research conferences:  I mapped out a teak forest in Costa Rica.  I mapped biomass movement by ants in a Costa Rican rainforest.  I identified nodes of increased parasitism of caterpillars in a park in Delaware.  I made a hydrologic model of aquifers in the Pine Barrens in NJ.  I used a hydrologic model of a creek in PA with ~80 years of flow data and land use (imperv/pervious) to draw conclusions on the depth and flow rate of the creek in the future.  I helped out a friend on a research project mapping terrapin nesting sites and comparing nest success to groundwater intrusion.  I was a busy little GIS bugger in college.

ColoradoSprings,36ba9d,im_a_grill_btw_AMA,1 point,Tue May 19 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"There are a number of excellent camping spots in Pike National Forest just to the west of town - no need for any excessive driving to reach them, either. My recommendation would be to first purchase a copy of the Pikes Peak Atlas (Houdek & Ormes) -- it's an absolutely indispensable tool for any hiking, camping, exploring in the Pikes Peak area. Seriously, this map is better than any you'll find in detail and insight. You can buy it online or at REI, and probably at Mountain Chalet downtown. A few spots that come to mind right off the top of my head are all accessible via North Cheyenne Canyon. Have someone drop you off at the parking lot at the end of Gold Camp above Helen Hunt Falls (I seriously would not recommend parking anywhere in the Canyon overnight). This is like a ten minute drive from downtown and it's a great jumping-off point to the forest and mountains above. I'd recommend hiking up to either Frosty's Park or any nice spot you find along the Pipeline Trail (Nelson's Camp is about a mile below Frosty's and there's lots of neat little places to camp). If you're feeling strong in the legs, camp somewhere below Mt. Rosa and hike to the top in the morning for some incredible views of the city. If you can go even two miles outside of Cheyenne Canyon, there are tons of incredible little spots alongside little streams where there's fresh water, great views, and seclusion. Colorado Springs isn't like Denver in that if you're willing to do a bit of hiking and exploring in the mountains just to the west, you're going to be pleasantly surprised in the seclusion and beauty you find."

There is actually a quite a bit of variety around town as far as nightlife goes. I'm still trying to hit all the bases, but it's difficult with how spread out COS can feel. What kind of 'nightlife' establishments are you looking for?"
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,theMUFFINcatMAN,1 point,Sun May 17 16:27:30 2015 UTC,I'm really cool with whatever. I guess i'll just have to go out by myself sometime. I'm about half a mile away from Holy Cow. So I may just start there. I'm not really sure how easy its going to be for me to meet people while alone ha
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,qurdind,0,Sun May 17 17:37:42 2015 UTC,What type of bars do you like? When I hear nightlife I think of clubs and not bars. Let me know your interests and I'll try and throw some suggestions your way.
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,49ersjrice80,3,Sun May 17 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"Assuming he is a southern boy, with only 3 bars in his hometown, I'm going to say he probably is looking for a bar and not so much a club."
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,qurdind,0,Sun May 17 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't like to make assumptions. I know a lot of guys I served with in the Marine Corps that were from small towns in the South who like to go to clubs. Maybe he doesn't want to go to the same old shit that he was stuck with in his small town? I don't know. That's why I'm not being an idiot and assuming one way or the other."
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,49ersjrice80,1 point,Sun May 17 06:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are correct, probably not the best to assume.. But he left with not much information... I know many of the guys I served with who were from the south hated clubs... I guess I came off all wrong...   What I wanted to say was: What would you recommend as far as not a club?"
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,qurdind,1 point,Sun May 17 06:31:16 2015 UTC,"Well, without knowing people's taste, I can say which ones I've enjoyed.  Downtown: Tony's: Small neighborhood type sport's bar. Decent food and prices. Good crowd.  Oscar's: Average size bar. Frequent live music. They have a lot (from my perspective) of cajun food from crawfish to frog legs. They fry fish on the patio pretty frequently during the summer as well. The crowd is usually pretty good as well.  Supernova: 80's arcade bar. Great selection of booze. Great staff, say hi to Amber. She's one of my long time friends. It does have a hipster crowd, though, if you are into that. They also have some really great food.  Not Downtown: BooDad's: Sand pit volleyball bar. Love this place in the summer. It's the only place I know of to play sand volleyball and enjoy some frosty beverages in the sun. The crowd is usually decent, though you do get some pretty obnoxious people more so than the other I've listed so far. Average booze selection. Staff is usually pretty decent. Haven't tried their food, but they claim to have good cajun food.  Overtime: Kind of a hole in the wall Sport's Bar. Good staff. Average selection of booze. Just a nice place to go watch some football. Usually a small crowd of pretty decent people. I think it is a Bear's bar, so if they are playing that is what will be on. Haven't tried their food. Say hi to Kati, she's a long time friend of mine.  Joe's Bar: Another hole in the wall. Average booze selection. Staff seems decent. Kinda grungy. Just a decent place to go drink beers with some buddies and get away bigger bars imho. They have a lot of poker and, unfortunately, karaoke.  Good Company: The place I hate to love. I've been going here pretty much since I got out of the Marines. It used to be a shit ton of fun, but it has changed drastically. Only an average selection of booze. Staff is hit or miss with a few core good employees. The owners are amazing, however. They've started having more live music lately which is also hit or miss. They have UFC fight nights which I keep away from at all times. You will pretty much always have some ""tough"" guys trying to turn spectating into participating. If I go there now, it is usually after work or on the weekends for some day drinking before the idiots show up. They use to have decent food, but I haven't ate there for quite some time.  Holy Cow: Might have been renamed to just The Cow, recently. Not sure. Decent sized bar with a rooftop bar. Usually has good looking women even on off nights. Prices are higher than I like. Staff is ok, usually little hotties like my friend Tiffany. Say hi to her. Booze selection is again average I'd say. They have some great live music. They do have beer pong and cornhole as well. I don't even know if they serve food to be honest. The crowd is hit or miss. With good looking women you tend to get some pretty obnoxious dudes as well. With that being said, I personally haven't seen more than a couple of fights over the years I've gone there.  That is all for now. If you're looking for something specific in a bar, let me know. I'll try to give a more specified answer."
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,qurdind,1 point,Sun May 17 17:11:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really not looking for specifics.  You gave me some good sounding options, i guess the thing i'm asking is where I could go to meet people. I'll probably end up going alone, so i'd like to make some new friends (and of course meet some ladies). I could get down with pretty much anything. I've been to New Orleans more than I can count, so i'm accustomed to hole in the walls and actual clubs."
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,_crackling,0,Sun May 17 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of the bars I listed don't have too many people to be honest. I'm older now and kind of like it that way. GC, Holy Cow, BooDad's, CowBoy's, Gasoline Alley, and Copperhead Road are some places you could meet people and that have the more dense populations of women. However, with these places you are also going to get a lot of idiots both male and female. Its give an take, I suppose. Hah."
ColoradoSprings,368fgt,Thoroughcavitysearch,1 point,Sun May 17 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Copperhead Road is super fucking fun, but the crowd can be very rough. If you're a big boy, you'll have fun. But as far as meeting someone.... its usually way too fucking loud there."

When I bought my house the rule was north of woodman, west of powers, and east of union.  If you are looking for a nice area, check out briargate. It is a bit more pricey than some areas but if safety is what you are after then you won't be disappointed.  Again, my opinion."
ColoradoSprings,368olc,49ersjrice80,2,Sun May 17 06:40:23 2015 UTC,I second this! I LOVE that area.

ColoradoSprings,368olc,OfficerNelson,2,Tue May 26 12:11:31 2015 UTC,"Check the reviews and ignore anything earlier than 2011. You may get some responses from reddit but nothing that should be relied upon 100%. Do your own research as well; just google for reviews on every place you're looking at. They will likely be predominantly negative, so actually read them to identify common problems and consider bringing them up with the landlord or simply knocking on a few doors to ask residents.  500 sq ft seems a bit small for two people here. That's really studio territory. I don't know the prices they quoted you, but I would stick to the sweet spot of $1 per sq ft per month. You didn't say anything about your cash budget but I suspect you can upgrade to a bigger place.  You will not be signing leases in advance here. You sign, you pay, you move in. This is a military town so there is a large migrant population; landlords can't plan in advance, especially at the size and price you're looking at.  I have yet to find a decently-run complex that does not allow cats. Most allow dogs as well; considering looking for one that doesn't just to make your life a little easier.  Lastly, visit before signing. Never sign unseen, no matter what. There are a lot of places at your price point that will disappoint you."
ColoradoSprings,368olc,Corgiboi,1 point,Sun May 17 13:10:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno man.  I signed at a complex unseen from 1000 miles away,  maybe I got lucky.  I would sign another year no doubt."
ColoradoSprings,368olc,penguin1216,2,Sun May 17 14:09:15 2015 UTC,Anecdotal evidence doesn't really change the fact that you can only really get suckered in to a shitty rental if you don't visit it beforehand...
ColoradoSprings,368olc,rabaltera,0,Sun May 17 15:31:34 2015 UTC,This is exactly the reason I wanted to take a trip to the Springs in the first place and we just didn't get to seriously tour anywhere. Unfortunately I don't really think I'd be able to take another trip out there for visiting. I'm unfortunately probably going to HAVE to go in a bit blind and sign everything through email.  I like that you've given a cutoff year for trusting reviews... I'm never sure how many years back I should consider relevant when it comes to negative comments. I actually didn't look at any place unless I found them to have over a 3 star rating on a couple of sites. I was hoping that would be a better route if only because those apartments are obviously worth reviewing for some reason over others.
ColoradoSprings,368olc,penguin1216,0,Mon May 18 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"Glad to know about the ""sign, pay, move"" arrangement. I've had a hard time figuring out exactly when I should start putting applications in anywhere.  Rent we're hoping to keep under $900 and yeah, I'd ideally like something larger than 500 sqft but I'm more concerned with the convenience of amenities than living space size at this point.  My current place is renovated, 700 sq ft at $464 a month including my pet fee... I don't know how to translate my budget or expectations to more expensive rent prices, haha. It's saddening looking at rent prices for myself as an adult, even going into this move with my boyfriend as an automatic roommate."
ColoradoSprings,368olc,rabaltera,2,Mon May 18 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"Berkshire Apts are pretty old.  Stay away from the Airport/Crestline area, it's not a good area.  Both Encore properties you mention are in good locations.  I cannot picture Signature at Promontory but that area is just ok, used to be lots of homeless people there but they moved the social services office so may not be an issue now. Even so the homeless aren't dangerous.  Knoll at Sweetgrass is nice, Lamplight Square is nice and good area.   Ridgeview Place Apartment are nice, good location.  Candlewood and Ironwood are both on the same street as Ridgeview Place - this is kind of mid-city, easy access to everywhere.  Here's a link to a nice place, good neighborhood, lots of trees, should be good prices - http://www.thecentreapartmenthomes.com/.  Palmer Park Garden apartments I always thought looked nice from the outside at least.  Otherwise, advice about west of I-25 is good for renting houses, I can't think of any nice apartments over there in your price range.  Maybe Camelback Pointe - probably pricey though.  There are some old victorian homes that are multi-apartment houses downtown near Colorado College.  PM me if you have more questions or need more specifics I don't mind helping out."

We move in June 3rd! I am so excited to live in that area. We know we don't have the most updated apartment but it's a start and the community seems really friendly. Check out their Facebook page as well. They like to have smoothie parties and they serve breakfast here and there. We got a $99 deposit deal for our place.

Also, one of the people used my information to help himself get a payday loan. Mike Shaw: Shady handling of my credit app and would not budge on price. They will try to push a GMC on you also. Phil Long: They aren't bad service-wise, but their prices are kind of crap.  Places I liked:  Hueberger Subaru: They are the number one Subaru dealer in the country and they are more than willing to level with you on a final price. They sell so many new models that they don't care so much about how much they make on used, they just need to sell them for what they paid. 2012 Ford Fusion for 11k with 15k miles. Pretty sweet.  Hertz: They have a small dealership in motor city, will give you something for your trade no matter the condition in most cases, and they are firm on price so you know what to expect when you get there.  Most of all, know how much you want to spend and don't budge, don't negotiate price based on the payment you want, always negotiate price out the door (sale plus tax and dealer handling), and if you are ever feeling uncomfortable, whether you have a reason or not, follow your instinct and walk away."

I bought a truck at the Springs CARMAX, and while it wasn't the best deal, the buying process was actually pleasant! Upon receipt of the car's maintenance history it was clear they put a ton of work (at least $500 in parts alone) into the car before sale.   I over heard them working with a few people with poor credit, and low down payments. They were working very hard and politely to make it happen. One poor women had gift cards and was calculating the max withdrawls on her whole family's debit cards since her bank was closed. The amount of patience shown was pretty admirable."

If you can afford MaxCare, that's one of the best warranties I've seen for purchase, though I admit I haven't seen a lot.  The service department is really nice, too, and includes a 6-month, 6000 mile warranty on their work, so if it goes over the initial month, you can still be covered.  Needless to say, but we've been very happy with the service there.  Sales helps you get what you want, and doesn't try to upsale you, service does what they can to take care of you, which is usually a good bit, and the financing people are super nice, straight-forward, and happy to answer questions."

ColoradoSprings,35stqx,Twystoff,3,Wed May 13 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"Property tax doesn't just get paid by people who have houses.  If you rent, you are paying property tax too.

ColoradoSprings,35stqx,hammerstrabe,5,Thu May 14 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"You know...conservation of momentum says the faster you're going, the more energy it takes to change velocity. So in theory, you can avoid most of the damage a pothole causes by going over them really fast.  Might be a solution until they get fixed."
ColoradoSprings,35stqx,knightro2323,2,Thu May 14 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"True, but let's think about the system. The car's suspension needs time to react, to extend and compress as the wheel travels vertically. Travel over to pothole slowly and the wheel has more time to extend into the hole. Go over to pothole quickly and the distance the wheel can travel in the given time is less than if you went over it slowly. The energy can be absorbed by the tire. If you were at a slower speed the suspension would extend more, possibly putting more stress on suspension components. Of course, this is not a linear curve, and there would be an ideal speed for each pothole based on it's size.  This would be an interesting thought experiment, were it not for the daily opportunity to practice out on the streets."
ColoradoSprings,35stqx,raiderato,2,Wed May 13 12:28:14 2015 UTC,"I think your statement says that faster is better. If we're talking about the reaction speed of the suspension, and the angle of attack of the far lip of the pothole, going faster means less chance for an edge to impact directly with the tire. Instead it looks like a fast moving car would glance the lip on the bottom curve of the tire resulting in less chance to puncture.  Of course, as far as experimental data goes, all I have to go on is a mythbusters episode about bumpy road conditions and speed (showing that the faster you travel, the less impact the bumps have). This says nothing about tire damage, so I could be completely wrong."
ColoradoSprings,35stqx,knightro2323,2,Wed May 13 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"To a point, yes. There will be a point when the amount of energy exceeds the tires ability to absorb the hit, but a large number of tire punctures from impact are the tire being pinched between the rim and the road, like a classic  ""snakebite"" bicycle tire puncture. By increasing the speed, you are redirecting the energy that would have gone into the wheel into the much more energy absorbent tire.  If you are going to hit an unavoidable pothole, at the last possible moment turn the steering wheel hard to the side the hole is on. Just a quick jink toward the hole will load the weight of the car on the non-pothole side, somewhat unweighting the side taking the hit. This reduces the speed at which the suspension extends from the point of reference of the road. You're lifting the top of the strut at the same time as it is trying to extend into the hole."

Can do drop off recycling any time as they have bins out for glass (blue, green, clear n brown) papers n magazines, cardboard, plastics (1-7), telephone books, plastic bags.  Sat n sun are very busy and sometimes the bins are full (not supposed to leave them outside of containers). Mid week is better less busy and less full containers. Dont pull up in front as that is for the trucks and the weigh station. Go to the west side alley (easier in and out) and park there for public area."

ColoradoSprings,35dw8e,SaintBroody,3,Sat May 9 11:23:25 2015 UTC,I work in water restoration in town and we have been insanely busy.  We have more work than we can even handle. Basements are flooding all over town.
ColoradoSprings,35dw8e,Bobomonkey00,1 point,Sat May 9 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm high and dry but a total novice as someone both new to the area and new to having a finished basement. I only had my old place in the Midwest take water once, downpour situation and our foundation wasn't exactly water tight. No harm no foul though. Curious about risk factors, we live uphill in the city, is that better for our odds? Foundation is good, solid drainage on the lawn but with a few more days of this on the way I've been nervous since hearing/reading horror stories. Also, what's the high water line look like in places that flood? Just in case I want to prep a bit. Maybe I'm over thinking it but I can't seem to find solid info on the matter. Any info appreciated, thanks."
ColoradoSprings,35dw8e,Springsbound,2,Sun May 10 00:27:00 2015 UTC,"It's mostly about your drainage, and the path of the water.   Grading is really important. Does the earth slope away from your house at all places? If so, you are probably in good shape. Most of the people I know who have been having bad flooding have bad grading, or live at the bottom of a hill.   Are your gutters doing their job, and getting all the water away from the house, or are they spilling into your easements? Easement drainage is also important. Covers can help."
ColoradoSprings,35dw8e,weauxbreaux,2,Sun May 10 17:51:12 2015 UTC,Also make sure you get everything off of the floor you care about. You may even want to invest in so rubber storage tubs to protect your belongings.
ColoradoSprings,35dw8e,Bobomonkey00,2,Sat May 9 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"We can get lots of rain, very quickly in the mountains; that alone can cause problems.   The other issue is the mountains themselves - they get hit by the rain, and it all has to go somewhere. If you live in the path of the water, you are screwed.  Our soil is another factor. It's just not great at holding water. This compounds with the mountains that had forest fires - after a fire the soil basically glazes, and it holds no water. (The soil also destroys foundations, due to the movement caused by the cycles between soaked mud and dry dust).  So put all these things together, and we get destroyed basements. One of my friend's basement is under a foot of water, which took down their hot water heater."

Bars and clubs have free drinks on ladies' night and things like that to bring in customers and set the scene for the night. But this just doesn't have a reason.

There are whole months that are dedicated to the appreciation of other heritages. Given the ugly history of white heritage, I don't think anyone will argue that white people need to be appreciated for theirs, but I think it is worth mentioning that certain aspects of ""affirmative action"" do more to perpetuate racism than they do to ""make up"" for it. I think this White Appreciation thing will demonstrate that in a way. I mean, how ridiculous is it to argue that ""if only white people are offered a discount then the whole community should"" but to also argue that ""Black or Hispanic civillians should receive a special discount at some time or under some conditions due to the hardships their ancestors have faced.""  I think it's an issue that needs to have attention brought to it somehow. Equality means not just the lack of discrimination but also the lack of special treatment."

ColoradoSprings,35b2rq,OfficerNelson,0,Mon May 11 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"Drifters is bland. The buns don't have the same texture (a bit dry), the meat is not as flavorful, and the fries are fresh from the freezer section. It's slightly less greasier and crunchier, in my opinion, which is not really a plus unless you're a health geek. They're cheap, small sliders - they're supposed to be bad for you. Plus, I'm not really a huge fan of the stores themselves - the atmosphere is what would happen if someone who's never been to California (or In-n-Out) designed a Californian burger joint, which is strange because it was supposedly designed by someone who has... the name is great but the branding isn't there.  Not saying it's a bad burger, but it's not a better burger. That said, in terms of big chains, I'd go Five Guys any day."
ColoradoSprings,35b2rq,Handsomehwang,2,Sat May 9 04:25:40 2015 UTC,You and I are just completely different then. I hate 5 guys. I also think Drifters is much greasier than In N Out but you definitely are entitled to your opinion and your experiences. I was just sharing mine.

As far as I know, I don't have any serious brain injuries, so I can't speak first hand about the rehabilitative abilities of the GyroStim machine. However, my job exposes me to many people undergoing physical therapy and other rehabilitative treatment. Although I can't say that it the GyroStim has personally changed my life, I have heard from several patients of the injury center that it is has helped alleviate a multitude of symptoms, including headaches and vision problems. As the news video also shows, it can be used to treat any range of brain injuries or brain disorders.  The machine rotates you on  several axis while you perform some basic multi-tasking activities. For instance, using a laser pointer to shoot ""targets"" while doing simple algebra. If you think that this machine might be able to help you, I would suggest you at least visit the Colorado Injury Center and speak to one of their doctors about the machine. The scientific theory behind it is fascinating."

ColoradoSprings,357afh,coloradoscreamin,4,Sat May 9 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"This is a beautiful town but don't move here unless you already have a job arranged. I am currently on my way out after struggling to make it here for years.  Your options for work are: military, retail, restaurant and everyone's favorite call center. Some people here have been working the same cashier job for 10 years.   The city has done its best to drive away any tax revenue and the streets are filled with potholes. A mountain biker just get sent to the hospital because they hit a pothole. I get into a near miss every day at work because people are swerving around the potholes.  To make things worse the city made sure there'd be no future tax revenue by driving away recreational marijuana. The city hates marijuana even though dispensaries and and pot clubs (which sell recreational without having to pay any of the taxes) have started to fill the vacant strip malls with new life.  Housing is overpriced and apartments are usually in a state of disrepair considering what is standard in a normal metro area.   Really you'd be better off anywhere except Colorado Springs, the city who is so against the future they won't leave the past.  The south side is so crippled and ignored there is nothing that can save it. The residents call it the ghetto and while it looks nice there is certainly a hopeless mentality that goes along with it.  The youth is bored and disenfranchised. There aren't any careers and pot isn't as lucrative as it once was so you have kids turning to crime. One redditor posted here the other day about 20 year old selling his dog for $50.  There are more gun stores here than any Texas town I've lived which can pose some problems as everyone isn't a responsible owner.  Apartment complexes are usually ran by out of state companies whose primary goal is to raise the rent over and over, fixing nothing and have their half trained monkeys spew excuses. Almost every place I've lived her has had paper thin walls and with the new marijuana legalization everyone is deep coughing into the night.  Most of your neighbors will likely be military and you won't notice the diligent nice ones. No you'll notice the loud, and violent ones.   If you have a noise problem the city also doesn't do courtesy noise complaints where the officer knocks on the door to warn them. They require you fill out official paper work and a copy of your name and address goes to your accused therefore if you make a complaint they know exactly whose tires to slash, windows to break, and who's mail to steal.  Overall it's a big city with small town problems and leadership who are completely ineffective to solve any of the cities issues with more than stern words and a raise to their chair.  The police chief promoted his mistress, the mayor built a stadium instead of fixing the roads, the city council said no to tax revenue, and they all got a raise!"
ColoradoSprings,357afh,AjTheWumbo,2,Thu May 7 19:54:31 2015 UTC,YIKES! Sounds like you've had some very bad experiences in the springs. Makes me wanna rethink moving here for school (already accepted). Don't most cities more-or-less have these problems though?

ColoradoSprings,357afh,flippin_rex,4,Sun May 17 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of the negativity in this comment - the pot holes, the current pot stance, and the lack of GOOD jobs. While you can probably easily find an hourly job finding a career/salary job is near impossible. However, on the bright side it is a beautiful city - love the views, the sunshine and the rent is cheaper than Denver (although finding a place takes quite a few tries because it is a very fast market with a quick turnover). The Springs is a good middle ground between being in the Denver city life and traffic or moving to the mountains where you'd drive 45+ minutes to work. I wouldn't recommend the Widefield area, but as a last resort it isn't bad. There is not much there and the neighborhoods are meh. I found the westside of I25, downtown, Old Colorado City areas to be the best for a young person recently moved here, but of course those are the most expensive and hardest areas to find a place. Good luck if you do decide to make the move!"

ColoradoSprings,357afh,Punica,5,Fri May 8 15:46:57 2015 UTC,Indeed; Denver is fun but extremely expensive and finding work good enough to support myself in Denver may not be possible.  So many people struggling there - kinda scary.
ColoradoSprings,357afh,zwiebelsaft,3,Fri May 8 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"I lived in the Springs for a couple of years, then moved up to Denver so I am pretty familiar with both cities. The only thing that is noticeably different in regards to money is housing/rent. For example I was paying 675 for a 1 bedroom in the Springs, and now I pay 850 in Denver which is actually on the cheaper side of rent. Everything else is basically the same though.  Me and my wife both found jobs in the Springs relatively easily, me in a call center and her at a hotel, but I have a business degree and she studied architecture and neither of us could find anything related to our field of study in the Springs. When we moved to Denver, we both found jobs (careers really) within 1-2 months in our fields. We are probably pretty lucky to have found something so quickly, but believe me when I say that Denver has WAY more job opportunities than the Springs. It's not even close. Alot of that is because the city is obviously bigger, but Colorado Springs really is not growing at all, and /u/coloradoscreamin explained why. You can tell that Colorado Springs is broke, when I lived there they couldn't even afford to open most of the public pools in the summer. I am not sure if that is still the case though. Denver on the other hand is growing rapidly and it shows. Yes there are people struggling here, but you seem pretty smart and I am sure you could make it. Check out indeed.com if you havn't already.

Midas will also give quotes over the phone.   DO NOT go to auto tech plaza on 21st street. They were telling me a bunch of stuff is wrong with my car that I didn't even take it in for and it would cost 1200 to fix. When I called friend of a friend he quoted me 550 and midas quoted me at 532 even saying it could be much less if anything could be salvaged. When I called to pick up my car from auto tech, the lady that works the front desk got pretty snippy with me when I told her that everyone else is  quoting me less than half of their initial quote.

They call it ""reimbursement"" and they're very particular about the verbiage you use. But you reimburse them for the herb you smoke/take home. It is a thinly veiled purchase, but I've bought from them before in med card lapse and its not bad. Just pricey.

ColoradoSprings,34wud3,Laserdollarz,23,Tue May 5 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"Ent! Use Ent credit union!   They are the most popular bank in the Springs - technically credit union - and have been the most amazing bank I could have ever asked for. I bought my car through a 3% interest, 0 down payment car loan dividend like opportunity they had going. They pay out dividends to their memebers, I have very little money in the bank but still get about $40 back a year just because, and constantly have amazing rates and new loans available.   Best part is they are part of the shared branching network of credit unions. So, they might be primarily in the Springs, and a couple locations in Denver, but you can complete most transactions at thousands of credit unions across the country.   I seriously can't say enough good stuff about them - I know I'm being a bit ridiculous, but after dealing with Wells Fargo I can't tell you how much I appreciate them. I don't live in the Springs anymore and I still bank with them!  Tl;dr - Pay Ent $5 one time to become a member and have happy banking for as long as you want!!"
ColoradoSprings,34wud3,lkwalke4,6,Tue May 5 06:21:57 2015 UTC,"I do all my banking with Ent. Can't say enough good things about them.  Mortgage, auto loans and lines of credit. Good rates. Will never sell your mortgage.  Convenient. No fee ATM's.  Part of the co-op network. Received over $600 in dividends last year. Need a new ATM card? They make them on the spot. It takes only about 10 minutes."

ColoradoSprings,34wud3,lazyirishsparkle,3,Tue May 5 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"Do NOT use USBank, my husband and I's employer doesn't offer direct deposit so we both get checks, for the first month you open a bank if you deposit a check you won't get the money for a week, after the 30 days when you deposit a check you still have to wait 24 hours to have access to it. Along with that if you want to cash a check you have to have that much or more in your account or you get an overdraft charge. So if I wanted to cash a $600 check I have to have at least $600 in my account and if I don't they will charge me $40. Also when I told them I wanted to close the account they said I have to not use the bank account at all for two weeks before they will close it, so no access to my own money for two weeks just to get out of their bullshit. They also had to cancel and send three cards for me because the first two just never showed up."

My virtual apartment hunting (mainly on zillow and apartments.com) has pretty much only turned up large apt complexes or sketchy places (or both).   Do you mind living near students? There are a lot of older houses near Colorado College that have been divided up into individual apartments. I can't speak for the UCCS area, but I bet the housing situation there is pretty similar. I don't really know how to find out which of those units are available, though.   Good luck on your search! I wish I could be more helpful."
ColoradoSprings,34oy43,Luinne,3,Sun May 3 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"Don't knock all apt complexes here though!  I just moved into one on the lower west side, really nice.  Great location. Love it. $580 a month.  An extra 20 a month because I have a cat so I pay 600."
ColoradoSprings,34oy43,im_a_grill_btw_AMA,3,Mon May 4 23:05:13 2015 UTC,Mind sharing some information on said place?
ColoradoSprings,34oy43,TheYidiot,3,Tue May 5 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"You could look on Craigslist, but for $400/month, you would be better off splitting a nice 2BR than swinging anything less on your own. I would peg the transition from ""yes"" to ""no"" around $500-600/month - anything lower is asking for trouble.  Even at that price, splitting a 2BR won't get you a top place, but it'll get you somewhere pretty nice."
ColoradoSprings,34oy43,OfficerNelson,3,Sun May 3 07:17:51 2015 UTC,"Craigslist is 100% the place to go. I don't know that I necessarily agree that you'll get a questionable place for $400-$500 a month. What you're going to get, assuming you're smart enough to stay away from big complexes that are almost exclusively rip offs at your price range, which it sounds like you are, is a studio in an old Victorian house downtown, Westside or Manitou (only places worth living in the Springs imo). Yes, the appliances will be old, the carpet will be old and the building will be old.   But if you're a person who doesn't mind old amenities in lieu of cheap rent and cool location, you'll find a decent, not sketchy place in your price range - just use common sense since some of the places you'll find on Craigslist are scams. But definitely you're going to find more independently owned places that are going to be cheaper."

ColoradoSprings,34krbe,MrsSampson,2,Sat May 2 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"We have the lowest package, so I'm not expecting the world, but our service constantly drops during prime times. Just completely dies for about 15-30 seconds, then comes back for a random amount of time.  First thought it was the modem/router, because it's like 7 years old, and way it was dropping/reconnecting almost seemed like it was failing somehow.  They told us if we swapped it for a replacement with them, it would be an older refurbed model, but we could buy a brand new model for $100 so we did that. Still drops connection, it just reconnects a lot faster. The logs on the modem don't show a signal loss or anything, it's been hard to track down and since it only happens at certain times (but it does happen every day) it's hard to reproduce at will.  So it has to be a wiring/physical problem right? Moved the modem to different jacks, same shit. Called CL and told them we were having problems still after buying a new modem and it might be the line to the home, etc. I think that was in February, called twice in March, once in April. Every time they said someone would come out to look at it but we've never seen them or heard back from CL that they didn't find anything.   It's in my room mate's name and he's not really tech savvy, nor does anything online intense enough to notice the drops. (Most video streaming buffers enough that he doesn't even notice it dropping connection) If it was in my name I'd be storming the gates with a pitchfork.   But trying to play a game is just out of the question. I've pissed off my homeys so much from dropping in the middle of a GTA5 heist I can't even get a PT together anymore. Fucking crashed landing the helicopter on the 3rd one, literally at the gd finish line. About flipped the table.."
ColoradoSprings,34krbe,LevonFrench,2,Sat May 2 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"Same thing is happening to my sis. Her and brother-in-law used to do online gaming but can't anymore because of the same issues.    They got a service tech out twice to check everything over. I was there for one visit and he told me it was an issue with the equipment they got when they took over the business from the previous provider (Cisco ?). When the tech comes out, back at the ISP they put your connection in a diagnostic/troubleshooting mode. He went over everything and couldn't find any problems, albeit with the line in diagnostic mode. They had perfect speeds for about two days after he left, then the problems came back.    They were thinking they could fix it by themselves so they bought a new modem but the problems persisted. Then they upgraded their package to the faster connection speed. Still persisted.    They can stream video to four different TVs using different streaming services simultaneously but they cannot play any kind of online game that requies a steady connection.    My guess is that CenturyLink is failing at load balancing their subscribers and as a result, is having problems with dropped connections. They are pretty good for bandwidth intense stuff, but for the rest they are pretty bad no matter what level service you pay for."

ColoradoSprings,34csib,Mrsylvestermcbean,4,Sun May 3 00:47:49 2015 UTC,"My concern about John Suthers is that his history as a big-time state politician and his responses to questions about the issues suggest that his agenda is in keeping with the boomer-supported conservative machine. Lots of his focus has been on ""supporting business"" and pushing for development, which is usually synonymous with the kind of industry cronyism that has influenced the city and harmed its reputation and self image for so long. Suthers wants to push the C4C and sports arena projects through, Makepeace wants to gather more data on future impacts and community opinion before proceeding.  Makepeace seems at least to be more interested in finding out what her constituents want and representing that than pushing her own agenda; i.e. recreational marijuana sales. From her website:   Our city government is just that, ours. Therefore, once I am mayor:  There will be no secret meetings  City information will be available to the press and public  Public initiatives will require community input"

ColoradoSprings,34csib,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Thu Apr 30 22:10:15 2015 UTC,I have no idea what the extent of their power is.

Blumberbus' group MAIG sure makes it seem like mayors have some power in this.
ColoradoSprings,34csib,scarlin,0,Thu Apr 30 23:38:34 2015 UTC,Not the 13th amendment which abolished slavery? Or the 19th amendment which gave women the right to vote? Or maybe the 21st amendment which repealed prohibition and allowed us all to consume mass quantities of alcohol? Or maybe the 5th amendment which allows you to refrain from incriminating yourself and forces the government to prove your guilt? Or maybe my personal favorite - the 1st amendment which allows us all to say any stupid ass thing we want to say about our government without fear of reprisal.
ColoradoSprings,34csib,peanutbuttergoodness,1 point,Fri May 1 02:22:02 2015 UTC,And which one protects all of those in the event the government decides you don't need that first amendment anymore??
ColoradoSprings,34csib,scarlin,2,Fri May 1 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"Not the 2nd amendment. The right to bear arms would be fully insufficient against the might of the police state and the military. They have automatic weapons, armor, and missiles.   Your weapons only protect you from your neighbor - not your government."
ColoradoSprings,34csib,peanutbuttergoodness,1 point,Fri May 1 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"You are sadly mistaken.  Throughout history there are TONS of conflicts where the mighty military couldn't defeat a far smaller force due to any number of factors.  Lack of desire to kill your fellow countrymen would have the military moral at an all time low.  They may completely refuse to fight all together.  A lack of familiarity with wherever the fight happens to be gives a HUGE advantage to those defending their homes (or an area they're extremely familiar with).  Continuous guerrilla strikes have always and will continue to be very successful against an organized military.    If we do actually let the government disarm us, then your claim about being insufficient against their weapons and armor will actually be somewhat true.  Fighting back at that point becomes quite a bit more difficult."
ColoradoSprings,34csib,scarlin,1 point,Fri May 1 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"You couldn't stand against half a dozen police officers in this day and age. The police force has shown again and again that when pressed they will have no sympathy for their fellow countrymen. To think that somehow an armed, unstructured militia could stand against our government in any capacity is pure fantasy. It could have happened 100 years ago or perhaps even 50 years ago, but not in this age. Even if you had a thousand weapons in your home they have assault vehicles, body armor, drones, automatic weapons, training, and k9s.   I'm not advocating disarming anyone. I'm just saying we should be realistic about what owning a weapon really does for us. It allows us to protect our home from our neighbors."
ColoradoSprings,34csib,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Fri May 1 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree.  Me against a swat team and yes...I don't stand a chance.   But a community like the springs has a shit load of gun owners.  If the police start being excessively unjust AND the situation was dire enough to where people weren't going to accept it anymore, then the police wouldn't stand even a small chance.  This would take years and years of seriously diminishing quality of life before this could actually happen though."
ColoradoSprings,34csib,Budded,1 point,Fri May 1 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because in our run-down, business-unfriendly town, gun control is what we should all be worried about.

ColoradoSprings,34a3li,pingsinger,5,Wed Apr 29 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"I've stayed at the Antlers Hilton downtown and have always enjoyed it. It's a nice place that wasn't quite as pricey as the Broadmoor. The Broadmoor is cool to grab a dinner or something, but I wouldn't spend $400 a night to stay there."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,chilaxinman,3,Wed Apr 29 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"I second this. The Antlers used to be a competitor of the Broadmoor. It isn't so much anymore but it still has a luxury feel, is right downtown and is less expensive than Mining Exchange and The Broadmoor. Plus you can walk to have dinner at Phantom Canyon or Springs Orleans (The Mining Exchange's restaurant), Josh & John's amazing ice cream, parks, Modbo and SPQR art galleries, Kimball's theater... all kinds of stuff close enough to walk with a couple kids."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,adamXYL,2,Wed Apr 29 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"Dang it! I thought I had my choice narrowed down to 2, but you just put The Antlers back on the table. It's right smack in the middle of the other two hotels price points and it offers something neither of them do, walking distance attractions!   Is it safe to walk this area with a stroller?"
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,im_okay,3,Wed Apr 29 18:34:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,adamXYL,3,Wed Apr 29 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"Totally safe. Tejon street gets a little dicey on Friday and Saturday nights because all of the GIs come out to the crappy, booty-dancing bars... but as long as you're not pushing a stroller around 11pm it's totally fine. And I suggest walking to Over Easy in the morning for breakfast. It's a local favorite."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,weauxbreaux,2,Wed Apr 29 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"offers something neither of them do, walking distance attractions!   Mining Exchange is about 2 blocks away from Antlers, don't make your choice between the two for this reason."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,mybrothersmario,2,Thu Apr 30 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with you there, I stayed a couple nights there just for fun, and I wouldn't really recommend it, I've had more fun at cheaper hotels (namely the Radisson by the airport, right next to Solo's because of the pool..)"
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,The_Dr_Matt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:27:11 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will look into the Antlers. I hadn't considered just visiting the Broadmoor for dinner or something! Thank you for the suggestion.
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,OfficerNelson,5,Wed Apr 29 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you are heading in the springs, but The Academy Hotel is a good choice. I myself along with family members have stayed there many times.   Some of the benefits are a easy access to the highway and the Academy, an indoor pool and outdoor hot tub, and plenty of kid friendly restaurants around. A large breakfast buffet is included every morning (the guy who works the omelette station is really cool). They also have an attached restaurant/sports bar, and if you book through their website you get a food credit for every night you stay there.  Their website is a little bit dated in styling, but don't let that deter you, it's an awesome hotel that is kid friendly with easy access to the main travel routes through the city."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,CoSunny,3,Wed Apr 29 15:07:13 2015 UTC,"I would stay away from the Broadmoor if you're just on a family vacation.  Having stayed at the Academy twice, it is possibly one of the best hotels I've been in in CS for the price, even if it's dated. I was actually going to recommend it when I saw the title.  Their breakfast buffet is amazing, too - plus you get $5-10 (don't remember, it's been a while) per person each night for food, which honestly is pretty good for hotel fare. And yeah, that omelette guy is chill (although there were 2 or 3 last I stayed). You can really stock up on breakfast, then just get dinner there on the house. (They do have room service, but I don't think you can use the food credit for it - you have to go down to the restaurant in the lobby.)  It's a bit quirky, but it's enormous, clean, and comfy for the price. Depending on when you book, you can nab the best rooms in the place for $100 or less, and you could probably get a suite for $140.  The only problem with the place is if you're coming from the south, you've got to make the turn in or you'll be heading straight into the Air Force base with little opportunity to turn around!"
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,The_Dr_Matt,2,Wed Apr 29 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Seems like this one hits all my points, I will definitely check it out!

Everyone had their own ""space"", and I thought it was very affordable."
ColoradoSprings,34a3li,shanedn,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this might be the way to go.

You are detached from everything except the Zoo.  Cheyene Mountain Conference resort...very nice.  Well priced, not sure if they have anything for the kiddos.  Glen Eyrie might also be an interesting place to stay if you are looking at Broadmoor pricing."

ColoradoSprings,343wrl,im_a_grill_btw_AMA,2,Fri May 1 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"I moved from Texas a few years ago and got the same advice.  None of those stereotypes have been realized.  I got a lot more of that living in East Texas than I ever have in Colorado Springs.  In East Texas, the first question new people would ask when we met was which church I went to, and social circles were largely divided on those lines.  Not only has no one asked me that kind of question here, no one has volunteered their own info or pressed the issue one way or the other.  I know I'm surrounded by Christians, but none of them has ever done anything that would make me uncomfortable.  Literally the only time church and religion has ever been a topic of conversation is at my Buddhist meditation group, and only there because a lot of the Christians in the group seem to struggle with explaining secular Buddhism to their Christian cohort and have asked for advice."
ColoradoSprings,343wrl,flippant,2,Tue Apr 28 12:17:04 2015 UTC,In Texas not only will you get judged if you don't go to church but you will get judged on which church you go too.
ColoradoSprings,343wrl,retrospects,7,Wed Apr 29 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I feel compelled to respond to your inquiry, so I will. I grew up in southern Mississippi and West Virginia, so I'm well versed in conservative hypocrisy. I have lived here for eight years and feel that this town is not conservative, nor is it progressive, it is confused. This town is segregated along seemingly physical boundaries; the northern church folk, the western hippies, and the southern military. This town doesn't have a central focus of togetherness and harmony. It's more of a constant struggle to see who can yell the loudest. The church folk yell about their values and morals. The hippies yell about free love and weed. The military people just yell because they are drunk. No one is able to empathize with any other group because of their cranial-to-anal suction and thus this town has no identity.  You will not be harassed in Colorado Springs, you will be ignored. You might garner one to four friends and that's about it. You will struggle to find things to keep you interested in living here. You will look at Denver and Boulder and say, ""I wish I could afford a place there."" You will look at the job market and ask yourself, ""Why do people come here?""  There are good things about this town though.  The mountains are tens minutes away. You can literally be in the woods by yourself in half an hour, and not see another person for the whole day if you choose. Our biking and hiking trails are some of the best in the country. We have amazing critters: antelope, mule deer, falcons, eagles, prairie dogs, a huge variety of insects, mountain lions, song birds, smart birds (magpies), and so many more.  You will always find someone here that agrees with you, be you staunch republican, liberal socialist, or hardened fence sitter. I jest, but this town is just a menagerie of people. We are just a big melting pot of things that don't mix together in a pot. ಠ_ಠ"

One month we are all ""namaste"" and peace loving hippies, then next we might as well be up in arms about not being allowed to have AK47's under our jackets.

ColoradoSprings,343wrl,antieuclid,-3,Tue Apr 28 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters that you're unlikely to get randomly religiously harassed walking down the street.   (Although I actually got a fair amount of harassment when I first moved here. I had blue hair and there were a few months where I averaged one person yelling angrily at me from a car for every mile I walked outside. I ended up dyeing my hair back to brown, mostly for other reasons, and it hasn't happened since.)  But I will say that if you don't like being told you are terrible/going to hell/should be shot for being anything other than a gun owning conservative Christian, don't read the bumper stickers. I'm the sort of person who instinctively reads all bumper stickers and it makes living in the Springs a much more unwelcoming experience. The same thing goes for church signs and even some lawn signs.  Basically, there isn't all that much open intolerance, but the intolerance you do see is treated as a view that deserves respect, instead of the bigoted garbage most of the country sees it as."

ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,phlashko,3,Sat Apr 25 04:58:07 2015 UTC,"I would love to be able to go and do the all you can eat sushi. I have been trying to see what we have available in terms of sushi here in the middle of the United States. I am incredibly used to being in the Northwest, and so the lack of fish here is very sad. My only issue is we're on a budget and cannot usually afford to go out to eat. Do you guys ever do any kind of discount or promotion?"
ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,ArtorTheAwesome,3,Fri Apr 24 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't have any real discounts or promotions. We offer an Active Duty Military discount and a $2-off text thingy for first-timers.   Honestly, I know that the sound of All-You-Can-Eat Sushi in the middle of Colorado is if-y and that it can get very expensive, but if you give us I try I swear you won't regret it.  Lunch AYCE is ~$21.95/person and Dinner AYCE is ~$29.95/person. We also offer the individual rolls Al-a-carte if you don't think you can eat that much worth of sushi, though after having a roll or two, people typically change to the AYCE. That's another great thing, AYCE isn't locked in stone. We will do everything in our power to make sure you pay the least you can while still getting the most and best food we can provide.  We've had people from California, Hawaii, and even this cute little old Japanese lady that say we have the best Sushi anywhere. We would love to see you both come to the restaurant and give-us a try. In my opinion and the opinions of many others, it's well worth it."
ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,LKillie,3,Sat Apr 25 00:44:31 2015 UTC,$30 a person for all you can eat sushi?? I can't move to the springs fast enough! Totally going to give you guys a try when we get there.

ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,pedrotheterror,6,Fri Apr 24 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"All of Jun's service is bad. I will not go back. Went there a few years ago off Centennial, and we walk in, Jun is at the hostess stand. We stand there for like 5 minutes, and then he says ""What do you want?"". I was so pissed. I refuse to ever go back.  EDIT: I can understand if it was a young hostess that said that. But it was the fucking owner. What do you think I want."
ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,TheMrNick,3,Fri Apr 24 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"I've been to the Jun on Academy about eight times, and I always get the worst waitress (the one who doesn't know how makeup works) and she doesn't understand splitting the bill. Last time I went I waited 50 minutes (timed) for a single roll and two pieces of nigiri.  Jun on Centennial, I've been three times only ever sitting at the bar and the service has been great each time. The chefs were good to talk to. But, it's been more than a year since that's a tad out of the way for me. Those Godzilla Eggs though! And that Bad Boy Roll. I have to go back when I crave it."

ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,mgweir,4,Fri Apr 24 17:09:30 2015 UTC,They made the best crunchy roll. They had the best miso and the dressing on their salads were amazing. The sake soaked oranges they served at the bar with every order were so sweet.  weeps softly

ColoradoSprings,33pqdr,mgweir,3,Fri Apr 24 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"I am surprised you received bad service at Jun's. I have been going there for years and it has always been great. I also go to Sushi Rakkyo at Briargate and Union. Although not quite as good as Jun's, they have an all you can eat menu for about $25 for dinner that has a great assortment of items as well as things like bulgogi and teriyaki. The Gazette often has a coupon dropping the price to $22. It is by far the best all you can eat Sushi place I have come across."

ColoradoSprings,33hv5o,hereticjones,5,Wed Apr 22 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"The best brunch hands down is The Broadmoor. But it's $60 a person so it damn well better be fucking mind blowing. Which it is.  If you want to be more realistic, Over Easy is just okay. When they're on, they're fucking on, but they're not consistent. We gave them like 5 tries and they were only good twice. The rest of the times something was always off; the service, the food, something just didn't work each time so your mileage may vary.  Lucha ain't bad but they don't do breakfast as well as they do lunch and dinner.   Honestly you'll have the best food and service at The Egg & I, but it's very old timery and kid friendly as well, so you'll have to deal with that if that's a concern.   If you want a little known, hole in the wall delicious place, check out Ski Barista. Just google it."

ColoradoSprings,334li6,BonkMureland,2,Sun Apr 19 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"All pet-friendly complexes will have breed restrictions; few will be willing (or even able) to skirt them. Many have insurance policies that explicitly prohibit certain breeds full-stop, and they can't do anything about it. However, you can work with those who don't to try to get around the ban.  Obedience training and tricks help put on a good impression if you choose to bring your dog with you apartment hunting. A ""letter of recommendation"" from your current landlord is even better (research this yourself - you'll want to write your own and have them sign it to save them time). Above all, don't argue or get defensive - it's not worth your time (or stress) to try to point out that risky breeds are a myth.  You probably are already aware that renter's insurance will go up with a dog (especially a pit mix). Unfortunately, landlord's insurance policies are the same, and the vast majority opt for simply banning high-risk breeds to lower their costs. If you switch to a house, you need to be aware of whether the HOA has an insurance policy which also prohibits certain breeds - you may run into a similar problem.  Finally, you mentioned that your dog has a pitbull like face - are you sure it's a pit mix? You might want to try a breed test to figure out if it's a pit or not. If not, many complexes will be willing to skirt the restriction with the breed report. It's around $80 and you might learn something interesting."
ColoradoSprings,334li6,OfficerNelson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:58:35 2015 UTC,"yea, i's definitely a pitmix, and has that pitbull face.  I've actually come across an apartment complex that has no breed restrictions, Fillmore Crossing.  So, when the time come, if there are no private landlords with available places within our price range, then we could always look for a place there."

ColoradoSprings,334li6,personpitch85,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"I have a german shepherd and was having the same problem. I called everyone that came up on zillow, craigslist, forrent and apartment guide with no luck. One lady I talked to told me to call apartments etc and they were super helpful. I told them what i was looking for and about my dog and they gave me a list of apartments that allowed gsds and was 98% accurate. I would give them a call and let them know your situation (719) 597-7800.  I was just out there 3 weeks ago (from ohio) and looked around a lot so I can give you an idea of some of the areas I would personally stay away from if you dont have the opportunity to go out there before hand. I found many of the complexes managed by Griffis Blessings allowed me to bring my gsd but I do not recall if they had anything about pits (http://www.griffisblessing.com/). Some of the much nicer communities do not have restrictions but the price range is upwards of $1,000 a month.  On the cheaper side Aviator apartments was one that I remember looking at and the manager had 2 pits and loves all dogs. They were a much cheaper price and right on the edge of what I personally consider good/bad area. The buildings were a little bit older but they claimed to be new management and working on fixing alot of the issues from the old managment. I will admit the newly renovated apartments were very nice on the inside. If you are interested I can try to find some of the more expensive apartments I looked at that allowed any pets but most were around $1,100 a month for a 2 bed room"

So I hope I can provide some insight for you.    I'm 25 and found a few Meet Up groups that fit my interests and met people that way until I found a job. The meet ups are great and can also be used to help find people with the same dog interests as you. I made more friends at my jobs later.  As for work, the job I found easiest to get was call center work. It's not amazing but they pay over minimum usually and it's almost always full time. For retail there are two major malls in the Springs (Citadel and Chapel Hills). I recommend Chapel Hills because of the area and selection. Those will be your best bets unless you find a small shop in the small local areas like Manitou or Old Colorado City. These are typically harder to get in. I found my (awesome) current job through Craigslist so always check your online resources.  I see a lot of motorcycles around town. I don't ride myself but I occasionally go out on my friend's scooter and it's a great area to be in. As the weather gets warmer more and more motorcycles come out and there's definitely noticeable amount.  There are a few dog parks I've seen around town that have very good attendance. I'm not a dog owner but they look like people enjoy them.    I hope this helps and I hope you have a safe trip!"

Coincidentally I also know basically no one in COS, and am looking to get a dog. I'm from south Ontario, so also a bit up north (not as much as you though).  I just got back from the springs, I spent all of last week there meeting some people at the school. So now I know about five people in COS, but four of them are old profs lol. I'm moving there at the end of August, hopefully we can meet!  One thing I can tell you is that places are surprisingly close together in the downtown area. That'd probably be a nice place to live in. Another thing I noticed is that there is a shuttle bus that goes from the UCCS campus to a nearby shopping centre and back, about a ten minute ride and it's free. Then it's a twenty-five minute bus ride from there to downtown. Since I'd be going to school, living by there would be convenient for me ... Not sure if that's helpful to you."

I'm not going to be going to school, but I won't know anyone at all. I'll be in there around end of June to mid July, and if I am still there end of August, I will definitely PM you and we can meet up! I appreciate the heads up on transportation and layout, sounds like a decent transit system for students and whatnot."

ColoradoSprings,3331k3,SurferGurl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"I'm 22 (almost 23) and have been living in the Springs for almost a year now, after obtaining my Bachelor's degree. I'm originally from the Denver area. Firstly, let me extend an early welcome to Colorado Springs! I had an expensive apartment off of I-25 and S. Rockrimmon Blvd. I ended up terminating my lease and bought a nice house. If you're going to rent, do some research, and don't bother with any newer apartments. You'll just experience problems. Just be sure to do your research.  Personally, I wouldn't go too close to downtown for living arrangements. And the further you go down south, the worse the area. I've gone down south, and it is definitely not the most pleasant. That being said, downtown is fun on the weekends and such, especially if you like clubs, pubs and breweries.  There are lots of shopping areas throughout the Springs, and I would say you're better of staying closer to the UCCS area if you're going to be around there, anyway. North Academy Blvd. is big for shopping and groceries and such. You can probably find everything you need in that area.  Convenience, I have learned is not always judged by how close you are to things. Your living arrangements should consider safety, cleanliness, loudness and reliability of utilities. Being close to shopping and whatnot should be a secondary factor. If you can find a place that can provide all of that at a good price, then that should be your goal. But remember, living near convenience comes at a price, and that price isn't always monetary.  Hope I could provide some insight!"
ColoradoSprings,3331k3,affectationz,2,Sun Apr 19 06:50:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! Could you recommend me some neighborhoods near UCCS you think would be good for a newcomer? I'm looking for a single bedroom apartment, hopefully under $600/mo ...  Within walking distance from the school (say <20 minutes) would be best. When I went last week I found some apartments called Sunset Creek, right by the shopping centre and pretty close to campus. The only issue is that it was a bit expensive.  Do you have any comments on the area near Austin Bluffs and N. Academy?"
ColoradoSprings,3331k3,SurferGurl,2,Sun Apr 19 06:58:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't spent too much time looking at residential areas near UCCS. They tend to be a bit expensive. I would recommend that if you can, find a roommate and look into getting a place together. It will be far more cost-efficient in terms of your living arrangements, as you will be able to live in a better area while also staying within your budget. Under $600/mo is not too common around the UCCS area unless you go south.  Look through Apartments.com, as that's how I ended up finding my apartment arrangements before I moved into my house. One that stood out to me was Fillmore Ridge apartments. Looked a bit more modern in comparison to many other apartments in that price range. However, it's also about 3 miles away, so certainly not the easiest walk :-/"

It's too big to really hand myself but I was able to get it dragged into the driveway for now.     I Just had a guy come by to see how much it would be to chop up and haul away and he said $150!!!   I get that tree work can be dangerous and that in general it is an expensive service.  But the most dangerous half of the job is already done.   Am I missing something?   Can someone explain to me why they would still charge so much for this?   The branch is about 12-15 feet long and about 4-6 inches in diameter at the thickest.     I guess I am just going to get a power saw at the hardware store and chop it up myself.    Firewood anyone?

For some positive or exciting information, if you like being outside, you will love Colorado Springs.  Check out UpaDowna https://www.facebook.com/UpaDowna and http://www.upadowna.org/. They have a Pedal Party and a First Friday art ride where you can meet some great people.  If you have a bike, on June 20th, there is the Starlight Spectacular. https://www.facebook.com/StarlightSpectacular and http://starlightspectacular.org/ It is a nighttime fun bike ride through Colorado Springs with several options in length and difficulty. Proceeds benefits Trails and Open Spaces.  The access to trails and parks is amazing. The city is very spread out. Having a car is almost necessary. Mass transit is not good. I commute by bike year round and see many other bicyclists. Please watch out for bikers on the roads.  I’m originally from the Central New York rust belt. I can offer some suggestions from coming from the east coast.  The people here are very friendly. When they saw howdy or hello, they do not want anything from you. They are genuinely friendly here.   Weather-wise, Colorado Springs is wonderful. Four seasons but not too much of any one season. Winters here are easy compared to the east coast. They don’t salt the roads so cars last forever. This past winter Colorado Springs had a record snowfall of only 40” of total snow. The snow is light and fluffy not like wet cement. When you get to town, drink more water than you think you need and wear sunscreen. In a high-dessert climate, you will need to acclimatize to living at 6,300 feet with little humidity. Bonus – summers with little to no bugs and black flies. Sitting outside at night is enjoyable.  Driving in the Springs is interesting. Many people came to here via the multiple military installations. As a result, the person the 4X4 plowing through snow could have moved here from the south and think their 4X4 is indestructible in the snow. You won’t be able to predict what drivers will do here like the east coast.  One request, most people relocate because of better financial opportunities. Not to pick on NJ but the NJ government and economy is dysfunctional just like NY. When you vote in Colorado, please think about why you are leaving NJ. I have seen too many people leave their home state because of onerous taxes to vote for high taxes in Colorado. This makes no sense to me. The live at let live attitude of Colorado is wonderful.   Lastly, don’t mock the Denver Broncos.  Good Luck!"

I do a lot of smoker cooking, curing, and baking so I probably drop by once a month and restock. They also have a rewards program that gets you free stuff."
ColoradoSprings,32lgty,nemesis1637,2,Wed Apr 15 02:56:08 2015 UTC,My husband loves their ghost pepper salt.  We also buy their honey powder and put it in our coffee when we're traveling.

I literally look at open carriers with a heater on their hip with a sense of pity usually reserved for the pants-saggin' backwards-hat-wearin' tweaked-out b-boys that still somehow populate the bus stops of South Academy. Pull yourself together, man.  Real world example. My arm got the fuck bit out of it last week breaking up a dog fight. I kept it bandaged for a day after it stopped bleeding, and after that band aids sufficed. It's now scabbed over, and I have these hideous gigantic tooth punctures from a full size Rottie that could go uncovered, but I wear long sleeves because I don't want to freak anyone out. I think it's kinda cool, and it will be one helluva scar, but it's not everyone's bag.

ColoradoSprings,32irdb,dswow91,3,Tue Apr 14 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't know what Pikes Peak Park was, so I looked it up. Apparently I live there(Spring Creek neighborhood). I've found the location to be basically perfect, with fast and easy access to Academy, I-25, downtown, and 115. Everything is convenient, traffic is easy, the views are spectacular. Now, my neighborhood is probably not generally lumped in with the rest of it(it's fairly new, 2008ish), but I've driven through the so called bad area, and it didn't seem dangerous to me. Of course, I moved here from near St. Louis, so my perceptions may be skewed. Still, at no point in all my time in/around St. Louis did I ever fear for my safety, nor was I ever mugged, robbed, shot at, or assaulted despite doing occasionally stupid things like walking alone from Soulard to downtown at 2 am during Mardi Gras. It seems to me that most people have a vastly inflated estimation of how likely they are to be a victim of a crime. You're safer in any part of Springs today than you would have been in the some of the nicest parts of most cities in 70s and 80s."
ColoradoSprings,32irdb,Fragarach-Q,2,Tue Apr 14 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the worst parts of town, but nothing like the ghetto in Chicago. But if you are picking that because of location in regards to downtown, it really isn't that close to downtown. Unless you are referring to driving. If you want downtown, live downtown, it's pretty awesome and rents can be pretty comparable."
ColoradoSprings,32irdb,shanedn,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"Refer to this map,  sounds like you might be in the red ""bring firearms"" section  But what do I know,  I live in chicago myself.  I'm moving into the yellow hippie  section on the west side in 2 weeks.  Pretty sure nothing in the Springs is anywhere near relatable to what we're used to in chicago."
ColoradoSprings,32irdb,Neighborhood_Rapist,2,Thu Apr 16 01:36:45 2015 UTC,I love this map and laugh every time it comes up.  We've just rented a house in the hippie stripe near GotG.  I keep thinking it would be nice to re-do this as a browsable Google map.
ColoradoSprings,32irdb,emeksv,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:53:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in Pikes Peak Park for my last 10 years in Colorado.  It's not as bad as everyone says.  The places you want to avoid are the Whitney Young Apartments, The intersection area of Carmel Drive and Monterey (That area in general especially the Westwind Apartments).  I lived in the Westwind and saw 3 guys get stabbed, 2 people die on the corner from getting shot, and another guy attacked with a sword.  That was all my last 2 years there.  The rest of the area isn't that bad.  The area immediately around Carmel Middle School isn't bad either.  One of my really good friends was killed in a double homicide at the Whitney Young Apartments.  A lot of drug dealers and gang bangers live there.  I'm telling you this from experience from knowing a good chunk of the guys who still live there.  I graduated from Harrison High School.  It's one of the schools that falls within the district.  If you have kids, it'll be either Sierra or Harrison that they attend.  Depends on which side of the park you live on.  Also, try to avoid most of the homes on the Eastern side of Delta Drive.  The Whitney Young is on the Eastern side of Delta as well.  Not that the whole area is bad, it's just very hit or miss on that side.  Try to stay NW or West of Delta.  The area around Montezuma Dr. isn't that bad either.  I used to live around there and I still have a buddy that lives on Kodiak drive.  Having said that, you can walk down the street and you don't have to worry about getting shot.  Most people mind their own business.  Whenever I go home, which is every 3-4 months, I stay with family in Pikes Peak Park and I never have issues.  They don't have any issues either.  I go jogging around the area and no one ever messes with me.  Then again, most of the people I see when I'm out I already know.  It's only about 10 minutes from downtown as well.  You can hope on the MLK Bypass to I-25 and be there pretty quick.  TL;DR it's not as bad as everyone thinks it is."

ColoradoSprings,32irdb,tall_bob,0,Tue Apr 14 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"One of the worst areas of town, and the neighboring areas aren't much better. Most of the crime & shootings in the city happen in that part of town. Probably very tame compared to some of the areas you are used to in Chicago.   The location isn't great at all though, it's not really close to anything worth being close to. Not really closer to downtown than any other part of town, unless you go way out east."

Id recommend bear spray or a gun (preferably both). You will be fine, it's not like a mountain lion is going to unzip your tent and eat you. Honestly I'd be more cautious of snakes than anything."
ColoradoSprings,32g2iz,dkon777,2,Mon Apr 13 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"As long as you put take precautions to put your food up, there is no problem. Bears will usually not attack unless you get between a sow and her cubs, even then she is more likely to scare you off than attack you. A hungry bear will try to get to the food source, but doesn't pose a major threat.   The biggest thing I would recommend is a GPS unit to keep yourself from getting lost. It's easy to get mixed up when you're wandering in the trees by yourself.  Tell someone where you're going and when to expect you back, use common sense and have a good time."

ColoradoSprings,32e18d,PreachtheReality,7,Mon Apr 13 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"Where in the Springs are you working? It is a really spread out town with varying prices depending on where you go.  This is a big military town, so a good amount of places have month to month and shorter term leases, but they are going to be a bit more expensive."
ColoradoSprings,32e18d,x4vior,4,Mon Apr 13 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"$1200 is a fine budget, you can probably get an excellent apartment for that price. Not so sure on the month-to-month - not all places will do it, but the majority will - and anything month-to-month in that price range for a 2/3BR is probably fine. I consider my apartment to be ""up there"" and it'd be $1000 M2M for a 1 BR. It's no penthouse on Central Park but still, don't let anyone talk you into bumping up your budget, especially if it's only until you jump into homeownership.  For that price, frankly, you could probably rent a house depending on your needs. If you can find a place willing to rent with an option to buy, all the better. (I am no real estate agent, so honestly I don't know how that would work, but I'm sure someone out there would be open to the idea. Then, if you're comfy, just buy the place and you won't have to go through another move.)  In terms of location, check ""the map"". That's about as complex as it gets. Obviously you'll want to spend a few days scouting (never rent unseen, no matter what the place) but just check some reviews, make a short list, and do some tours.  Last note - make sure you check that the property is pet-friendly. There are a good number of complexes here that outright refuse dogs, and most others have breed limitations. Some will also drop a hefty pet fee on you. Don't even waste your time visiting a complex that doesn't advertise as pet-friendly, obviously."

I can't speak to the school situation, but as a former Columbia resident  (West Ash, out near Gerbes) it feels familiar.   Sure, there are bums and the occasional bear, but you can ride your bike to Red Rock Open Space, or Garden of the Gods. My neighborhood park is packed full of kids most afternoons, so that's a good sign for your concerns. I've been here a year and no issues but for a dead skunk under the porch.  Leon Gessi's Pizza is as close as you'll get to Shakespere's. But it's a pale imitation. That aside, I love it out here. El Taco Rey is really tasty. I'll never move back to Missery."

ColoradoSprings,31rr50,greeleyborn,8,Tue Apr 7 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"DO NOT SIGN THAT !!!!!! I work in the agreement business, some of these terms are illegal(at least the way you wrote them) go somewhere else around here. This landlord sounds like trouble he is trying to push cost of regular maintenance and repairs onto you. by state law he cannot make you pay the remainder of the lease by law he has to make a serious effort to re-rent, to try and say he is not responsible for faulty writing is horse shit. not being able to run a business is just ridiculous. I seriously doubt the legality of them being able to sell your stuff for the money owed(unless it's a storage unit type storage) the way did they made it legal is with the clause saying you are signing rights away...... please just rent somewhere else you will be much happier"
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,kepleronlyknows,2,Tue Apr 7 18:54:36 2015 UTC,"the way did they made it legal is with the clause saying you are signing rights away   That probably still doesn't save them.  You can't just make an illegal clause legal by asking the tenant to allow it.  I'm only in first year of law school, so not a lawyer (but on the other hand I just read these cases last week), but many illegal lease provisions can't be ""contracted around""."
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,greeleyborn,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"What baffles me is that they are a property management company, not just some arbitrary independent landlord. I've definitely had a ""this is bad news"" feeling about the lease terms since I've read them, and have found more and more things that I am not okay with as I re-read it.  This post was more of a ""am I going to have to just buy a house to not have to deal with this crap"" question than a ""should I sign this"" question. I would never sign away so many of my rights even for my dream house (which this place is not quite)."

ColoradoSprings,31rr50,satherp,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:33:03 2015 UTC,This sounds like my old property manager that we rented from when we first got here. After assuring us we were moving into a great area of town(airport/murray) we had a drive by shooting not 2 weeks after we moved in. I became concerned because I had a toddler at the time. They refused to let us out of our lease despite the fact that they had not disclosed we were living in the middle of a gang war (told to us by code enforcement when they were asking about the gang tagging on our fence for like the 8th time). Someone was eventually killed in my front yard. We moved. They tried to sue. Got really nasty. Beware of who you rent from.
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,OfficerNelson,2,Fri Apr 10 20:43:34 2015 UTC,A few we looked at wouldn't even let us look at the lease until they ran a background check...  Ton of crazy landlords out here.
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,threeLetterMeyhem,2,Tue Apr 7 18:34:47 2015 UTC,That's kind of standard procedure for both the high-end stuff and better-than-thou places in bad parts of town.
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,lazyirishsparkle,2,Wed Apr 8 03:24:15 2015 UTC,"Could anyone tell me if any of the following are typical?   Since you asked if any are typical... here's my experience. I'm not a lawyer or anything.   -In any default by the tenant, all monthly rent for the remainder of the lease is due immediately. This seems to be the case even if they evict you as a result.   Similar wording is actually typical. If the lease is terminated by fault of the tenant, outside of the terms of the lease, the tenant is still financially responsible to fulfill the lease. It's normally a pain in the ass for the landlord to actually collect, though.   -Landlord agrees to try to give notice that he's entering the property. Probably. If he feels like it.   Typically the landlord needs to give at least 24 hours notice. I wouldn't agree to anything less.   -Tenant assumes all repair expenses.   Nope. Not even close to typical, and I'm not sure it's legal. The landlord is typically on the hook for all repairs and wear and tear maintenance. The only exception is if the tenant does abnormal damage (like... gets in a domestic violence thing and smashes up the place). Again, it's a pain in the ass for the landlord to actually collect.   -Tenant responsible for all glass breakage, regardless of cause.   lol! Never seen this in a lease.  -Tenant will not operate or perform any business from or in the premises without prior written consent of the landlord. (My boyfriend runs a business online and works from home, so this is a problem)  Something similar is normally typical, and it's probably worded poorly in your lease. The goal is that the tenants are prohibited from servicing customers on premise, turning the place into an agriculture operation/warehouse, or destroying the property by storing and shipping irregularly large merchandise.   -Landlord cannot be held liable for injury due to defective electric wiring.   Good luck enforcing that. The landlord('s insurance) is absolutely liable for situations like this.   -Tenant pays landord's legal expenses and attorney fees for the landlord in the event of a legal dispute.   Someone's smoking crack with this one.   -Personal property in the premises is security for payment of money and rent due. Landlord can take and sell your stuff if you owe him money.   Not even close to reasonable or typical. The landlord can take and sell abandoned property after a certain amount of time has passed. There are legal processes in place that a landlord has to go through to seize property like this. In short, it involves suing you, winning a judgement, and executing on the judgement.   -Tenant agrees that by signing lease, they give up certain legal rights.   Rights don't really work that way.   -Tenant and landlord give up right to a trial by jury in the case of dispute.   Arbitration clause! I've seen these, but I'm not sure they're very typical. I've seen some leases that require arbitration before proceeding to a full trial, but not really in complete replacement of a trial."
ColoradoSprings,31rr50,DatBurn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"u/threeLetterMeyhem has some great explanations. I'm curious about the ""certain legal rights"" though, they can't write that without actually stating the rights.   I've seen clauses about selling the tenant's property, but it takes a judgment from court after filing a demand notice with no payment received. It takes a while to actually get this process done...source, property manager (commercial). The glass replacement is hilarious, what pm company would really try that???  Are you willing to share the pm company name? Anyway, if not, the good ones I have heard of around here (again, I'm commercial, but through the grapevine) are Haley Realty, Sunflower PM, and Griffis/Blessing."

Either way, if this is a difficult situation involving divorce, it's very important that your friend gets her own lawyer to represent her in the process. Divorce law is absolutely insane and near impossible to understand even with a JD. I can't imagine trying to represent myself effectively in a case where my emotions would constantly be battling down whatever rationality I had."

ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,raiderato,3,Fri Apr 3 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of bad info being posted here.  OP, here's how you get to the top without trespassing.  There should be no bushwhacking involved as it's a pretty well-defined trail with lots of geocaches if you're into that.  The trail taking you to the summit is a beast, it goes almost straight up the hill in places.  Bring some bear spray and/or a gun though, last time I went up there I saw lots of evidence of mountain lions in the meadow.  Also take the time to follow the pipeline trail.  Even if you don't go all the way to the Broadmoor Lodge (private property) you can still get an incredible view from some of the outcroppings you pass on the way which are on public lands.  If you do decide to make it to the lodge, the view from the flagpole on one of the spires is seriously unbeatable, hands down the best view of the Springs rivaling Pikes Peak because you're so close.  Not sure you want to try that now since they've apparently been rebuilding up there.  Good luck and have fun!"
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,GBFel,2,Sat Apr 4 02:50:56 2015 UTC,There's the road that leads up to the lodge on Cheyenne Mountain proper (http://www.broadmoor.com/cloud-camp/) . You can't get up to the antenna farm as it's all fenced off (for good reason...)

ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,SexualHarasmntPanda,0,Fri Apr 3 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Not the antenna farm road that switchbacks up. I had this argument with a police officer up there. The sign at the gate says ""closed to vehicle traffic"" or something similar, it does not say ""no trespassing"". I've walked it a bit and have seen numerous other people walking the road but we were yelled at one day and told by two police cars that there was a security team behind them (there were multiple cars behind them) and that they would press charges if we didn't hustle down the road ahead of them."

ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,UbiquitousFiend,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:38:20 2015 UTC,But the antenna farm has nothing to do with NORAD. It's fenced off but still public property for the rest of the mountain.
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,SexualHarasmntPanda,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:40:12 2015 UTC,There are some broken trails to the top but there's a lot of bushwacking involved. The mountain is part public property and part private property. Anywhere in the NORAD area or near the antenna farm is going to be a no-go but you can get to the top on public land. The Pikes Peak Atlas probably has some better details but I don't have one nearby to check.
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,semental,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:48:20 2015 UTC,I doubt you have ever even gone up there.  The trail is quite clear and pretty well trafficked actually.  You won't get anywhere close to Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (NORAD is on Peterson) unless you jump off the Eastern face.  The private property is not well marked but as long as you stay off of the road and away from the transmission sites you're fine.
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,GBFel,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"Did you go from old stage by the stables? We obviously didn't go the same way because we got lost and never made it. Another time we ended up on the antenna road where we were yelled at. I don't know or care about the station names, it's just the no-go area on cheyenne mountain. I've lived on the zoo side and explored a lot of old stage."
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,semental,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, the same trail I linked to elsewhere in here.  Trail was clear as day until the last ~100m to the lodge which was the only bit on private land, and even then I just followed the pipeline and was fine."
ColoradoSprings,31bxtw,GBFel,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's gotten more traffic since the lodge went up, I didn't even know they put a lodge on top and had to google a bit.

ColoradoSprings,31b309,WardJ,-3,Fri Apr 3 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"The title is the infuriating part.  Last night it was something like ""Cadet Found Injured in Dorms at Air Force Academy.""  The fact that they changed it without waiting for a release of the name in accordance with DoD policy for next of kin is selfish.  Also, /u/xthorgoldx's post above gives a pretty good explanation of what is going on."
ColoradoSprings,31b309,reddancer,2,Fri Apr 3 14:47:31 2015 UTC,I am not sure what your problem is with the article. They would write it the same way if it happened at UCCS. The fact that the Academy is concerned about safety and security leads one to believe it is more than just an accident.
ColoradoSprings,31b309,mccscott,0,Sat Apr 4 02:35:16 2015 UTC,They just released the name.

ColoradoSprings,31b309,raiderato,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"Aw, shucks, those darned laws keep getting in the way. Sure, I mean, the whole ""Not release all information related to a death before next of kin notification"" thing probably prevents undue emotional trauma to families of the deceased, but pageviews are so much better if we have a name to paste in big bold lettering and a sob story to tell! Or to demonize, depending on whether we like the guy or not.  Gazette can suck a dick. They wear their dry, shrivelled-up little heart on their sleeve.  Love how they try to dig up the January attacks. No, Gazette, FOIA does not mean you have immediate access to any and all information, especially when it's been made clear that it's related to a criminal investigation."
ColoradoSprings,31b309,xthorgoldx,3,Fri Apr 3 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, they said that in the article. What more do you want?  You can only summarize the article in the headline, you can't write ""Cadet dies at academy but federal guidelines say that they have to wait a day before releasing names and details so we can't get you that information right now"" in bold at the top of the page.  There's not even any sensationalism or misleading going on in the article, and especially not the title. Sure the January attacks are brought up, but that's a recent news item about the AFA. It comes at the very end of the article, where all recent coverage is placed. Have you even read a news report before?"
ColoradoSprings,31b309,raiderato,-3,Fri Apr 3 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"They said as much in the article, but the headline is written with an intentionally negative connotation.  ""Air Force provides little information about cadet death.""  It's a subtle use of language, but subtle is what propaganda and opinion pushing is all about. If the article is about a cadet death, then why not ""Cadet found dead in USAFA dorms,"" like every other (respectable) news source is?"
ColoradoSprings,31b309,DatBurn,6,Fri Apr 3 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Because ""Cadet Found Dead After Injury In Dorms"" was basically their initial headline (actually,it was probably more damning than the current one, IMO). Sure they could have kept it, but you don't get people to click on an updated article when the headline is the same.  Everything they said is factual. You read it negatively because you have some empathy in your heart for USAFA. I saw nothing wrong with it. It didn't say or insinuate anything bad about the Academy.   You read it that way because you wanted to read it that way."

I haven't been during season but will be there come Fall.  Everyone here drives like a friggin' jackass so plan for it to take longer to get everywhere than you're used to but there's no real 'rush hour', it's just slow.  It is especially hectic if there's weather. There are only arterial roads here, for the most part too, so it's pretty easy to get your bearings.  It's also beautiful, friendly enough and any of that churched up rightwing stuff people complain about is really not all that in your face.  Lot's of Christian radio for one dial but that's about it.  Enjoy the change of scenery.  It's phenomenal dang near every day."

ColoradoSprings,30prkh,PM_ME_UR_ARMPIT,3,Sun Mar 29 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything up here is similar (and expensive, at least for the Springs). I live a few blocks away and it's a quiet, safe neighborhood, but don't expect the Ritz. It's just a good apartment with moulding and maybe a nicer kitchen than you'd get otherwise.  Ultimately you're going to worry about parking and neighbor noise more than anything, which will vary wildly depending on what building (and what unit) you get. Just do some tours and see what you like. Also make sure you read the reviews; they are generally more negative than positive, but they will tip you off as to some potential problems. We were looking at a place which looked fine but after reading the reviews we found that the fire alarm wiring was faulty and tended to go off nightly during the winter. Mentioned it to the leasing agent and she just brushed it off saying something like ""well if that happens call us and we'll have it fixed"".  Also, if you are going for this price bracket, pay close attention to the office. It seems counter-intuitive, but the furnishings and attire give a hint as to how professional the management company is, especially at this price. Anything less than smart casual is a red flag. We found a few places that tried to reach into the $1k market but their office was more fitting for half of that, and reviews confirmed our suspicions of a baseless upsell.  One last thing - if you find a place with a window in the kitchen (that opens), that is a huge plus here. For some reason the $1k apartments like to put the kitchen as far away from the windows as possible..."
ColoradoSprings,30prkh,OfficerNelson,2,Sun Mar 29 18:29:31 2015 UTC,Why is the kitchen window a huge plus?  Just ventilation i assume?   Where I'm currently at has no window anywhere near the kitchen and my new place (in a month) does.   Yay
ColoradoSprings,30prkh,derek_jeter,2,Sun Mar 29 20:03:03 2015 UTC,Yeah. If I want to use my Foreman grill (or I just burn some toast) the smell likes to travel into my bedroom because there's really nowhere else for it to go. The ventilation fan basically blows whatever smoke or steam you're producing directly into the smoke detector.
ColoradoSprings,30prkh,OfficerNelson,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:40:32 2015 UTC,Great point.  My smoke detector goes off from steam when I take a hot shower.  And then my neighbors above me goes off too so I feel like a dick.   I've since learned to aim a fan directly at it whenever I shower.  Can't wait to move lol.
ColoradoSprings,30prkh,derek_jeter,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:31:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Definitely a lot of good advice.

I liked it, for what it's worth.    I went there because it had gates on the community, and I had a pretty special car at that time.  I would estimate that the gates were non-functioning (for whatever reason) 20% of the time, though.  Really: no complaints.  I had a nice apartment, no maintenance issues, no drama when I moved out.

My raised garden beds are covered with screening to protect it. I have had great success with lettuce spinach (they can start now, they are a spring crop and go to seed early here). Tomatoes (use walls of water to protect young toms) peas beans peppers scallions corn broccoli squash pumpkins ect.   Also there are ""free"" seeds at manitou seed catalog at the manitou library. The deal is you get some seeds from it then at the end of the season you give seeds back to them to grow the library. Enjoy and good luck"

ColoradoSprings,30kmlr,d_woolybugger,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:27:14 2015 UTC,"Don't plant until May for one thing. Mothers Day is usually a good starting point.  If you don't have a greenhouse or some way to protect the plants you are going to get hit with frost and lose whatever you plant if you do it earlier. It may be very nice right now, but there is a 99% chance of frost/snow for another month or so.  You can grow pretty much whatever you want though, try to pick things that work best with shorter growing seasons, 60-80 day peppers and tomatoes are what usually fill my garden, but there isn't much that I haven't been able to grow around here.  As was suggested before, pick a local nursery and go wild, they'll have what you need and if you don't know what works, ask them, they know their stuff."

Sime of them can negotiate on long term pricing. But please please please do not advertise him on craigslist. Dogs are often bought or given away to people on craigslist. who use those dogs as bait dogs for dog fighting. Please keep us updated."

We actually have a rescue pit who came from a bad situation like that and she can't handle strange dogs, and that's why we can't let him have his dog here :( Really, thank you so much for the info.

I've only played a few times and only only once in person.  I prefer playing via correspondence.  also, the game is very straight-forward and there are few rules.  there are no dice rolls, and most moves depend on coordination between multiple players.  most of the game happens between the moves, where deals are made and secret alliances form and dissolve.   this is why I prefer to play by correspondence. emails go back and fourth, moves are entered, the results are released, and the story unfolds. you slowly realize that your moves didn't work and it slowly dawns on you that you were double-crossed."

The law has essentially no effect on the ""youth"".  Honestly, most of the people I know that use it just drive to somewhere they can buy it legally.

If you actually look at the data, it's made clear that the majority of these visits are due to a combination of marijuana and alcohol or illicit drugs.

ColoradoSprings,2z4oik,ksuwildkat,4,Sun Mar 15 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"This looks like a good thing, but I have a practical comment about the kickstarter.  When kickstarter is used to fund business startups, the rewards are typically whatever the startup's product would be (the arrangements in this case).  I don't have any problem with funding startups like this as long as the funding rewards are in line with the planned product sales.  I don't like funding kickstarter startups that are basically asking for a handout to start a revenue-producing business.  In this case, the reward levels are not in line with the eventual product.  A least I assume that the company won't actually sell one thing for $10 and two things for $25.  That's a bulk-buy penalty that disincentivizes sales.  Mr. Peckham should think through what his eventual pricing would be and offer kickstarter rewards based on that, maybe with a discount to incentivizes funding the kickstarter and not just waiting for him to start the business and provide the product risk free."
ColoradoSprings,2z4oik,flippant,2,Sun Mar 15 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"You are right, it should probably be 1 of $10 and 3 for $25.

Some of the 4th year kids had asked if they could do something different.  he searched and searched and couldn't find anything.  I am guessing that search was the genesis of this.

ColoradoSprings,2yzimh,wild_bill70,2,Sat Mar 14 07:12:31 2015 UTC,"So how about we try to better educate this city's citizens about the state of city funding, find better city leader candidates, and vote for people that will put together good plans for rebuilding the city? I like to bitch and moan about stuff as much as the next guy and gal, but the systemic problem here, and many other places, is education, or more correctly in this case, miseducation. People, I'm not sure who, put a lot of money and effort into miseducating our citizens to vote for the politicians that drag our city down. We've got to stand up for the little guys and not allow the money of the city to just run it all and get their way. So when your friend or neighbor parrots something dumb from their friend, TV, or flyer that hurts our city in the long run, open your mouth and make them explain themselves. People that vote because the little box is red or blue need a good wake up call. Take it upon yourself to wake them up. My $0.02"

It sounds like you're education focused, so you might try looking at some of the local parks that offer classes. I know on the west side Cheyenne Canyon and Bear Creek need volunteers with their classes or to work the visitor's center desks. There are probably needs at the parks closer to you, as well. Someone else mentioned the zoo, which takes volunteers both in the education department as well as in animal care. If you want more physical work, Pikes Peak Urban Gardens uses volunteers, although it's more on an as-needed basis rather than a regular schedule. Serenity Springs Wildlife Center needs volunteers to help with tours and manual labor. I don't think there's any shortage of volunteer needs in the area!

Call down there to double check if they'll accept it though, because mixing oil and antifreeze together makes it much more difficult to recycle than if they are separate. Those guys are only open M-F 9-5, but they do something like 9-2 the second Saturday of every month. (Which would be this upcoming Saturday, actually, the 14th).  Good luck to you."

ColoradoSprings,2yiwt8,hlkhw,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"This is the email I received:  Dear Ms. [hlkhw]:  Thank you for contacting me with your thoughts and concerns regarding the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to impose new onerous rules and regulations on the internet. I always enjoy hearing from my constituents.   The FCC, led by three Democrat bureaucrats hand-picked by President Obama, approved a secret plan to fundamentally undermine a free and open internet. This decision ushers in a new era of government micromanagement that will discourage private investment in new networks and stifle the innovation that has allowed the internet to flourish.   I want to be clear that I support a hands-off approach to the internet. Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services.  With the recent failures and mismanagement of Obamacare, it is astounding that anyone would think that heavy-handed regulation created by government bureaucrats can manage the internet. This is a solution in search of a problem. I look forward to serious Congressional pushback against this secretive effort which threatens America's continued leadership in the global internet economy.  As Congress continues to debate this issue, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind. Rest assured, I believe in preserving the First Amendment right to freedom of speech on the internet and will always support policies that preserve the internet's open structure to promote innovation, spur economic growth, and protect the free exchange of ideas.  As always, I greatly appreciate your concerns and perspectives. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future on other issues important to you. For more information about my efforts on behalf of Colorado, please visit my website at Lamborn.house.gov and ""Like"" me on Facebook.   Sincerely, Doug Lamborn Member of Congress"

That time, I saw a lot of signs leading up to it. And that time, you could tell it was trying to do anything. This time there's nothing.."

ColoradoSprings,2ygp7i,Travesura,2,Mon Mar 9 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"We tried giving it a jump, but it does nothing.   Sounds like the starter solenoid has failed. Someone who knows how can likely take a wrench or screwdriver and bypass the solenoid, allowing the car to start. Then you can at least drive it to a location of your choice.  Bottom line: looks like you need a starter.  That is my best guess. Please don't take my word for it.  Here is a simple way to check and see if the problem is with the battery. Turn the dome light on, and turn the ignition key to start. If the dome light goes out or dims a LOT, your battery is bad. If it just dims a little or none at all, your battery is OK."

ColoradoSprings,2y6l1w,DaisyJags,3,Sat Mar 7 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"Warning: This text wall may contain organs and blood.  Haggis is Scotlands national dish, created a long time ago in order to utilize the meat of the sheep that is usually wasted. It contains the minced organs of heart, lungs and liver, with suet, oatmeal, onions and spices. It was traditionally cooked in the stomach of the sheep, but nowadays it's made in synthetic skin just like a large sausage, it doesn't stick together like a sausage though, so you cut the haggis skin open and you serve it like you would mashed potatoes.  Black pudding is largely pork blood, oatmeal and onions, also made into a large sausage, but unlike haggis it stays together much better. It's already pre-cooked when you get it, usually we cut it into slices and fry it very lightly, and eat that with breakfast, or in a sandwich. Although it is made with blood, it's not watery, and it doesn't taste anything like 'raw blood' to once it's cooked. It's impossible for me to really describe the taste, it's one of those things that you simply can't imagine without tasting it yourself.  Now, as disgusting as that may sound, Haggis is really no more than meat, people just seem to be squeamish around organ meat for some reason (even though I've heard rumours of people eating bull testicles over here). I can see why blood would turn people off, but if people are only worried about the taste, I can assure you it tastes nothing like the 'raw blood' taste you're imagining, it's unique and tasty.  Black Pudding and Haggis are the #1 and #2 most delicious things I've ever eaten. America has given me a new burrito addiction which makes a close #3."

They had a huuuuge selection of vodkas, a few beers I was unfamiliar with (but were good) and a small selection of cigars. They were grandfathered under whatever legislation banned smoking in bars, so you can light up in there, which makes for an interesting atmosphere.  I think it was cheaper than 15C (which is also a cool joint), but where 15C has a little bit of a speakeasy thing going on, Rendezvous has a...European discotheque feel, kinda."

It's a bit pricey though for just a few months and having one bedroom with living areas shared with 1-3 other people. You could probably get cheaper with a little Zillow/Craigslist hunting.  Good luck!

ColoradoSprings,2xqq6u,grilledsheez,3,Wed Mar 4 10:35:32 2015 UTC,"Okay. Nothing I'm about to say is a negative to the Springs.  Given this little bit of info I'd look elsewhere.   Denver has more hospitals including Denver Children's which is top drawer.   The Longmont area also has more easily accessible hospitals.   North of Denver--and this is anecdotal--seems to have much more construction and there are even quarries in Lyons.  Boulder and Fort Collins has college music scenes. Denver has larger acts.  I find Boulder and Fort Collins to be best for the outdoor activities you mentioned.   Boulder is expensive though has nice towns close (Longmont, Louisville, Lafayette, etc.).  Denver has some pretty groovy suburbs though do your homework.  Don't forget you can land in one town and spend the first year exploring the others to find the best fit for you.   Hope this helps."

I don't recommend it in the Winter since the trail is already barely existent after Crystal Park road. The trial up to Magog/Gog rocks is narrow but fine. After Crystal Park road you can only find the trail by pink ribbons and cairns. I accidently strayed from the trail even in the Summer. Bushwacking is a bad idea due to giant impassable ridges, dead fall, scrub oak, etc.   You can either start from near the incline, which will take you most of the day or if you have a connection in Crystal Park(gated community), you can start right at the base."

ColoradoSprings,2xjo4j,excessofexcuses,10,Sun Mar 1 08:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hi all!  I work at the Pikes Peak Workforce Center and it makes me really sad each time I see one of these posts about job searching and it doesn't get mentioned!  It's actually a really great resource and almost everyone who gets engaged with the services at the Workforce Center ends up saying ""Wow!  I had no idea you guys did all of this!""  I've refrained from posting about it until now, because I don't want to sound like I'm hijacking a legit post to advertise; I truly get nothing out of doing this - I just actually believe in PPWFC and the work we do for job seekers and the community!  Since OP specifically asks for leads, I think it's okay for me to tell you a little bit now:  Here's the website, where you can get lots of information about the different things that we do.  This page has our Hiring Events, where employers come to do interviews with people for open positions.  These are great for anyone who is in need of employment quickly and you don't really care what it is.  There are usually several hiring events each week.  Our Spring Job fair is coming up; this is the page for that!  The page also lists the employers that are going to be there along with what positions they are hiring for.  That's another good resource if you are just looking to see who is hiring right now.  But, going to the job fairs actually pays off.  Hundreds of people got jobs at our last one.  Also, we know that job fairs can be overwhelming, so we have a workshop that we give that teaches you how to make the most out of the time you spend there.  There's information about that, as well as the job fairs for teens (14-18) on that page.    There's tons more that the Pikes Peak Workforce Center can do to help you with your job search, from workshops to resume reviews to mock interviews to more specialized programs where you're provided a career counselor and some financial assistance.  All of these services are federally funded, so they're completely free to you.    We have an Intro to PPWFC Workshop that goes over everything we do and I think is a great place to start if you're interested!  I just did a search in our job database,Connecting Colorado and there are currently 500 full time job openings in Colorado Springs that have been posted in our database just since January 15th.  That doesn't include part time jobs or employers who left that field blank.  Hopefully that will be somewhat encouraging!    If any of you would like to PM me for more information about the Workforce Center or help with your job search, I would be more than happy to oblige.  Also, I'm the Volunteer Services Coordinator for PPWFC, so if you're interested in volunteering with us I'd love to talk to you about that, too!     Hopefully this is helpful to you in some way.... Have a great week!  Edit: fixed a link"

ColoradoSprings,2xa5nq,WSUkiwi,11,Thu Feb 26 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"Call me old-fashioned, but I feel like university police should stick to university property.  That's not to say they're undertrained or anything, but it's strange getting crime alerts for things pretty much off campus already. Isn't that kind of what the city police is for?  At the very least, they should be better paid for the significant increase in work they'll have to do now."
ColoradoSprings,2xa5nq,OfficerNelson,4,Thu Feb 26 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware – which honestly is limited – the move seems to be due to the exponential growth of campus, as well as new private student housing like The Lodges that primarily house students and are close to campus, but were previously out of UCCS PD's jurisdiction.  When The Lodges first opened, the party scene was out of hand and CSPD was responding regularly to what amounted to dorm room parties. Between that and the recent announcement that a developer is looking to demolish Bates Elementary School to build a private student-only apartment complex, I can imagine CSPD is looking to off-load those calls to the university since a) the majority of individuals effected are UCCS students, and b) CSD is short staffed as it is and needs to focus their resources on real calls of services."
ColoradoSprings,2xa5nq,slamchop,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless the city is paying money for additional availability of UCCS police, I don't understand how this is a benefit for the campus or students?"
ColoradoSprings,2xa5nq,OfficerNelson,2,Fri Feb 27 07:32:33 2015 UTC,"I'm more concerned about this being implemented without any input from students. Unless the city is giving us money for this, students are going to have to pay for the additional police resources that I doubt anyone wanted in the first place. I pay taxes for the city police, why should I have to pay for a redundant force on city and non-university property?  My rent just went up after the landlord announced new security patrols (which I have yet to see) and road ""repairs"" which didn't actually fix the roads, just filled them in with gravel which has since washed out from the storm. I overpay by a large margin already, now I'm just paying for more shit that I don't want - seems like UCCS is going in the same direction. How about accepting cash at the on campus cafes? Or better yet, keeping them open past noon?  I'd pay more for a lot of stuff but honestly this isn't one of them."
ColoradoSprings,2xa5nq,wreave,2,Fri Feb 27 13:40:40 2015 UTC,Interesting.  We also got an email today that the School District 20 security officers now have the authority from the city to write tickets for certain parking infractions. Seems like the City is expanding the authority of non-CSPD police/security. Wonder if there are any others?

ColoradoSprings,2x9bw1,wiggty,2,Thu Feb 26 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of a misleading title. The FCC can't overturn a state law. They preempted state laws in Tennessee and North Carolina that prevented municipalities from offering broadband. Which is awesome, but does nothing for areas like Colorado Springs, where there hasn't been much grassroots support for municipal broadband yet.   Much more interesting is the Title II declaration, which will, on one hand, make it easier for private ISP startups, like us, to overcome right of way access issues so we can run new fiber here in the Springs. And on the other, it doesn't provide for unbundling of local loops...so CenturyLink/Comcast is not required to sell us last mile access. We have to build out our own infrastructure instead of leasing/reselling existing."

ColoradoSprings,2x9bw1,peanutbuttergoodness,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"Typically whomever lays the coax, copper or fiber owns it. For a new subdivision, Comcast & CL will typically lay their last mile while CSU and the city are trenching water or electric lines. If there is an HoA, an ISP can approach them for exclusive rights to right of way..or could have, rather...as the FCC rules such exclusivity agreements weren't kosher a couple years back.   In other areas, it can be a little more complicated. There are several instances where a municipality will run it's own fiber and lease access to several ISPs, increasing choice and market competition"

The seller doesn't care about that when determining sale price, they have a fixed percentage they pay their agent no matter what.  If you are military and you are paying any costs besides the 2.5% va fee you are doing it wrong.  My house was bought through va loan and I paid nothing, not a dime."
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,CptnHeinry,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"Husband's credit sucks, I'm buying it with a conventional loan. Correct, the buying agent does split the fees, but they're legally about to refund to the buyer any amount of that as an incentive.  Looking at the area, I'll probably end up working directly with the sellers agent and pay a lawyer to go over the contacts they pull up, I was just curious if there are any buyers agents I could negotiate with to do the same."
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,Br4hm4,3,Wed Feb 25 18:15:24 2015 UTC,I work as an assistant for an incredible Realtor in Colorado Springs. I wouldn't ask her to cut her commission for anyone. In real estate you truly get what you pay for. And in my opinion anyone who will cut their commission for your business doesn't value themselves or what they have to offer very highly.
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,wiggty,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for the same services for less, I'm just looking for someone to handle closing after I do the work of finding the house. I wouldn't want less than what I was worth either, but paying a third of the price for a third of the work is still 100%. Like I said, I'll likely go through a lawyer, but I was asking to see if anyone knows of an agency (likely lawyers) that they've used before or knows does this."

There is a real threat of Fort Carson reducing troop levels which may severely hurt the local housing market and devalue your home.  I suggest you look at the East and North side of CoS for rentals. They come and go fast, usually within 48 hours after posting. If they are on longer then that, their is something wrong with the property."

ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,Dard001,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"If you want to deal with a seller that isn't using an agent, I would consider using a lawyer specializing in real estate to draw up the contracts. Your lender may be able to point you in the right direction. Traditional fee for using a realtor is 6%(negotiable) split between the seller's and buyer's agents. If you can find someone not using an agent you may be able to negotiate a better price, due to the seller not having to pay the realtor commission. If this is your first purchase, I would recommend using a realtor, but remember they are ultimately working for the seller."
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,Dard001,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:56:43 2015 UTC,There are buyers agents that will work directly with you rather than represent both parties. My concern is that with  a) the internet  b) the background I have in real estate  c) my mother who is a real estate appraiser  I'm paying thousands of dollars for a service we're perfectly capable of doing ourselves.
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,growedup,3,Wed Feb 25 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, you're probably not ""perfectly"" capable of doing it yourself, otherwise you wouldn't be here asking reddit for advice. In every market, there is a reason why a particular service exists. In the case of US real estate, realtors exist because the process of buying a house is ridiculously complicated. More so if you don't want to get screwed. Yeah, a realtor is interested in making a sale, but a decent one is highly knowledgeable and skilled in the process of buying/selling as well as identifying snags in the process. A good realtor will actually listen to your concerns and assist you in the search, negotiations, and inspections. I've purchased a couple homes already, so I can also claim I have a ""background"" in real estate, but in reality I really don't, not in comparison to people who make their living in the trade. The realtors I've worked with were definitely worth the money and made the process very easy on me. I interviewed my realtors similar to how I would interview an employee. And I've very happy I used them.  If you feel confident enough, then by all means, go ahead and try it on your own. Other people do it, and some are probably pretty successful with it. There are a million ways buying a house and screw up your life, and in my opinion if you find a good realtor, they can significantly reduce the chances of anything bad happening. This was worth paying for in my opinion.  In regards to paying fees, you're not going to pay more for the house than it appraises because a bank won't finance it. Unless you make some kind of side deal for cash, which would be ridiculously stupid. Basically, if a house appraises for 150k, the seller won't calculate fees on top of that, because your bank will simply say ""There is no F-ing way we're financing a house for more than it's worth"". If the appraiser works out a deal to cover these fees by falsely appraising the house at higher than market value, then he had better like going to jail, because banks aren't stupid. There are fees on top of the mortgage, but they are entirely up to you and your negotiating skills. In my cases, I had the sellers pay all my closing fees, repairs beyond the critical inspection items, and they had to leave their removable appliances."
ColoradoSprings,2x48yv,growedup,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:00:04 2015 UTC,A lot of times I would agree that services are there for a reason...a lot of time that reason is people are lazy and someone else is willing to do the leg work for a fee...an over inflated fee and most of us will accept it because it's what we are lead to believe is the only way of doing things.  Real estate is a prime example...there were homes being bought and sold long before there were real estate agents.  But because some one came along and made it convenient...it's just how we roll now.

ColoradoSprings,2x377o,KTBFFHCFC,2,Thu Feb 26 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"I've only lived here a month, but I've had great experiences with Old West so far. The owner is extremely friendly and knowledgable, not to mention they've been in business for over 20 years in the Springs. My advice to you is buy the biggest equipment kit you can afford. I say this because if you decide to stick with the hobby, you will be using a lot of the equipment for years to come. If you buy the cheapest beginners kit, you'll find yourself investing more in equipment as you continue to grow your hobby. This isn't to say that you won't eventually need to buy more equipment, especially if you make the jump from extract to all grain, but the kits usually offer a pretty good discount when compared to buying equipment separately.   Also, before you even buy equipment, read ""How to Brew"" by Palmer. It's the best primer out there and is referred to often by even the most experienced brewers.   As someone else said, check out /r/homebrewing. Read the info on the sidebar and wiki and check out the daily Q&A threads.

I actually live in Broomfield, but was in the Springs visiting my mom and grandma and we decided to pop in randomly after an Air Force basketball game and they were able to help us even though we didn't have an appointment. Of course if you're bringing 5 people, I would definitely set it up in advance, but they have plenty of space for a party of that size.   They have a decent size collection that is mostly in the <$3000 range, with a great sale section as well! The dress I bought (not on sale) was $1900. This is starting to sound like an advertisement, and I swear it's not, but wait! There's more! They give you a little coupon book full of discounts if you buy on your first visit. The one for the dress is $100 off, and there are others for accessories. You also get a 10% off rate with any of their recommended tailors.  They also have other formalwear, so you may be able to find bridesmaid dresses there as well, but I went with somewhere else on that so I can't speak to their selection/prices.   Good luck!"

ColoradoSprings,2wtyk7,Harv_Spec,9,Mon Feb 23 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Having owned many all season tires for year-round use before converting to snow tires for the winter months, I will never again consider any all season tire adequate in the snow.  Even the cheapest snow tires I've owned out perform the best rated all seasons I've owned if there is any snow on the roads -- no contest.  When you get to expensive snow tires, the snow traction is absurdly good.  Based on this, my vote would be to get chains for the front this season to get you through, look for a pair of same size, bolt pattern, and offset wheels during the summer when they are cheapest and most abundant, then buy a pair of cheap snow tires in the late summer before the snow falls.  If money looks good or if you find a deal, get a full set of wheels and tires, which is obviously the ideal case.  If it costs $50 each time a shop remounts tires, and you can find a set of used Altima wheels for $300 (very possible; $120 will get steel wheels), you only need three seasons of use to justify that purchase, not to mention the time saved by avoiding taking the car in.  That's what I've done with the last three cars and it is definitely the best option and can be done on the cheap.  Remember, tires are cheaper than accidents.  EDIT: Corrected grammar mistakes."
ColoradoSprings,2wtyk7,Nicholost,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:00:25 2015 UTC,So do you leave your winter tires on all winter long or do you swap them on/off when it stars/stops snowing?
ColoradoSprings,2wtyk7,Nicholost,2,Mon Feb 23 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"Winter tires stay on all season.  I swap winter tires/wheels on the first week of October; pull them off mid-April.  The extreme variance in our spring weather makes it tough to judge when to pull them off, so I usually error on the conservative side and will leave them on well into May some years.  There are a few additional perks to this strategy:   It takes me ~20 minutes to swap a set of tires and finish the beer.  It takes that long just to to make the round trip to the tire store I prefer. When either set of tires needs to be replaced, I drop off the entire set of wheels, continue with my errands, and pick them up at my convenience.  I don't have to wait around, choose a tire store closest to me, or ask for a ride. If I ever get a flat, I can temporarily swap on a summer/winter tire and wheel since they are all the same size, and not have to mess with the near useless donut.   Edit: Added clarity."

I've never had problems in the snow with my all-weathers.  I own chains but I have never felt the need to use them in over a decade of having them.  If you know how to drive in snow, you don't need to spring for the specialty tires."
ColoradoSprings,2wtyk7,weauxbreaux,2,Mon Feb 23 06:43:47 2015 UTC,"Snow tires all the way.   It's a bigger investment up front to have a second set of tires, but your tires last longer, and your car will actually do well in the snow."

They've lasted me about 4 seasons, and I've had to put them on about 2x per year (but I live on the palmer divide).  If I had the cash, I would do snow tires, but this at least allows me some comfort, as I can get where I need to go."

ColoradoSprings,2wtyk7,Travesura,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"Money tight? I would hold out til spring. Next fall, get a good set of all weather tires.  Chains are phenomenal for icy conditions, but are a pain in the neck to always be taking on and off."

If you're not used to high altitude, be careful doing it. It's physically taxing.   My second favorite spot is Old Colorado City. If you're looking for a night of fun, hit up Thunder and Buttons for pool and karaoke.   There are loads of good restaurants around the city, but a few I would recommend are La Baguette, The Rabbit Hole, and Ivy Wild. Ivy Wild is an old school that they turned into a brewery, restaurant, and bakery. It's really awesome."

There are several small condo communities/associations on the East side of town that have very attractive list prices for sale (like 2-3 BR condos for 60-90k-ish), but don't specifically state that HOA fees or condo association fees could be $500-$1000 or more a month.

You'll have decent access to I-25 directly along Barnes/Austin Bluffs and to the north along Powers, but southbound is going to be rather trafficy.  Since the area is mostly newer construction, expect a lot of young families and middle-class types, especially military and government contractors with Peterson AFB right down the road and a lot of major defense contractors in the immediate area.    I would definitely recommend talking to a realtor since Zillow is often full of incorrect data intentionally placed there by the realtors supported by the ""contact the realtor"" button.

ColoradoSprings,2vklsc,RandianHero,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"We've been using Cricket for about 8 years now and we are extremely happy with them.  We pay ~$100 per month for 5 lines with unlimited calls (including long distance), text and data. Although data slows after you reach 2.5Gb but even when I hit that limit it really isn't that much of a hassle.  The only downside is that they don't subsidize the phones so you have to pay full cost up front. That means that the Samsung S5 is $589 and the Apple 5s is $549. But you can pick up the Moto G for only $25 (after rebates). You can also find great deals on used Cricket phones on Craigslist.  We drove from here to California and back and listened to Pandora almost the entire distance. The only dead spots were in remote Wyoming and remote Nevada where you wouldn't really expect service anyway."
ColoradoSprings,2vklsc,scarlin,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"I know T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon all offer no contract now. Like in the past with no contract plans though, you will not get a subsidy on the phone, so you will be paying full price. One benefit is a cheaper monthly plan versus a subsidized phone plan. If you need to, they offer financing for the phone, which is just added to your bill over a set period of months after a down payment up front. They don't charge interest either.  With T-Mobile you pay the tax of the full price of the phone and then the down payment when you get your phone. I am not exactly sure how the other carriers do it, but when I worked for T-Mobile that is how we rolled. You can cancel your plan at any time, you will just owe what is left due on your phone that you financed and the prorated last bill.  All being said, if you have your own phone that will work with any of the carriers, they can put you on one of these plans and not add anything to your bill related to the phone because you already have one.  Hope that answered some ?'s"
ColoradoSprings,2vklsc,CStites23,1 point,Thu Feb 12 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"I actually did a price comparison last month. It's missing a few though, like StraightTalk and Cricket. It was supposed to turn into an interactive webpage for a little bit of practice in Bootstrap but I never bothered because family pricing gets way complicated and there are some limited-time offers which I didn't want to stay on top of. I also included some bare-bones by-the-minute plans (the $0/mo AT&T plan gives you an excellent rate for data at 1 cent per 5 KB).  I've been using my Nexus 4 on the T-Mobile $30 plan for 2 years now with no problems - bought it for around $200 and it holds its own among smartphones even today, so don't just jump for a Galaxy S5 or an iPhone because there are other phones out there that will do just as well for a third of the price. I don't use it to talk much so I rarely have to buy more minutes, but even if I do, it still beats out pretty much any plan out there. The Boost plans are a bit better, but you're stuck on the Sprint network and you have to buy a phone from them (they do have a very good selection, though). T-Mobile lets you use any unlocked phone compatible with their network.  As for the Springs, fortunately we've gotten big enough late enough that we don't have many signal problems within the city. I haven't had any, myself, but if you start poking around the mountains or driving down past Pueblo, you'll probably hit dead zones. If you're really worried about reception and you travel a lot, just shoot for Verizon."
ColoradoSprings,2vklsc,OfficerNelson,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"Been on Cricket for a few years and am happy with their service, and now that AT&T bought them there is solid 4G LTE coverage. Buy a smartphone outright, then pay $35/month for unlimited calls and texts, and 2.5gb of data (which I've never come close to hitting with all the WiFi out there). But go to a corporate store for sales/service or their national-level sales, the local franchises are staffed by folks who could care less about you and your needs."

Every once in a blue moon you can see military cargo (mainly c130s from what I've seen) coming in and out of Peterson.    I've seen Chinooks and hueys fly into Fort Carson many times   Best bet for daily aircraft viewings is the regional airlines coming in and out of the airport or the air academy, although its just cadets flying holding patterns in single engine props you'll also see parachute practice as well up there.  Best time of the year to get a good view of aircraft is air force graduation in May."

The only time you can see crazy jets are during the Academy football games, some Fridays (we just had an A-10 3 ship last week), and during graduation. I know Peterson has a few Hercs sitting around. Sometimes a T-38 squad will make a pit stop too.  If you want more, I think whiterice87 and mgweir said it all. The only aircraft I've seen from the army guys down south is surprisingly an osprey leaving Ft. Carson. They do have a bunch of static helo (and other hardware) displays if you're interested in that."

Blackhawks fly along 24 up Ute pass pretty frequently.  As stated, graduations and home games at  the AFA bring out some cool stuff- a few years back we had a B2 and a pair of F22s doing flyovers.  I've also seen a pair of blackhawks doing what looked like refueling exercises using a C130 while a pair of A-10s flew around, again over the West side, but didn't notice any rhyme or reason to WHEN they were doing it- just happened to be in the area.  We also had 160th SOAR doing exercises in Cripple Creek and near Pikes Peak a few  years ago- not sure  if any of that kind of scheduling is published, but high-altitude/Mountain training happens sometimes (we had training for Apaches going to Afghanistan a few years back, too)."

ColoradoSprings,2v7qx0,Travesura,3,Sun Feb 8 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"after waldo and black forest, i helped catalogue personal property.  if photos and receipts went up in smoke, all you have are memories of your possessions.  mentally walk through each space in the home, one room at a time.  list everything.  every little thing.  do any friends have photos taken inside and around the home?  use those as references for possessions that you might see in the background.  i realize this is tedious and very depressing, but this is the only way you'll get even close to settling with an amount with which you are satisfied.  start an excel spreadsheet, itemize each room and its contents separately, and use formulas so your totals can update.    try to start with small stuff and build your way up to more expensive and ambiguous items.  doing it this way will show that you're making progress and won't be so depressing when you get stonewalled by that coin collection.  don't put this off.  it's going to take a long time and the longer you wait, the more you want to put it off.  spend a few hours at a time.  it's exhausting work so you'll want to step away to clear your head.  i used online shopping sites to price items at replacement value.  this takes a ton of time and you won't be able to find most of the same items so just use similar products as reference.  you'll want to give up every day, but you just have to push through.  it's unavoidable, unless you want a paltry amount.  the more work you put into creating a comprehensive list, the most payoff you will have.  of course, results may vary, but from what i heard the details really matter.  listing individual items with detail show that it's your stuff.  for example, you didn't just lose a set of dinnerware and flatware.  you lost a crate and barrel bennet square dinner 20-piece set at $300 and an ainsley 20-piece flatware set for $170.  if it lacks detail, you will get next to nothing.  try to remember what you had and list it in detail.  online purchase histories also help a great deal.  if you ordered anything online, you will most likely have a purchase history.  check your credit card and bank account statements as far back as they allow.  looking at those may jog the memory and you can remember what you purchased.      i only helped price items and make lists.  i didn't deal with insurance, so you'll have to figure out how the company wants you to itemize your list.  is it full replacement value, depreciated thrift-store value, or something else?  once you have that settled, you can get online and begin assigning values to your items.  the company will also give you a deadline to turn in this list.  you really want to finish this as quickly as possible so you don't miss the deadline and you are paid sooner.    catalogue all your items and go way over the policy limit.  you won't get everything back, and the settlement won't be close, but you want to be able to get that full settlement payment.  the only way that will happen is if you make a list that far exceeds the policy limit.  sorry to hear about this.  glad no one was hurt."

ColoradoSprings,2v7qx0,TuffMeister,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"My house burned down and I had a really hard time with the insurance company because most things I had were incinerated and I didn't have much reference, except for my memory. Be as detailed as possible and number each item clearly.    Detail every item as best as you can.  Where you bought it, when you bought it and how much you paid for it.  Even clothing, itemize each shirt, pant, sock, undergarment, shorts, etc. Look through cell phone pictures or friend's pictures of your house if possible to help your memory.   3,  Make a copy of your itemized list for yourself.  When you start to replace items write the exact number of the item replaced from your list on the receipt and make a copy of the receipt for yourself.    Be clear on your itemized lists.  My insurance company was very confused when I wrote in ""Kitchen Utensils"" I had to write in every spoon, fork, spatula, knife, bowl, etc (I know I'm repeating myself on this one)   I didn't know when and where I bought every single thing I lost, so I just estimated.  I'm sorry you have to go through this as it is such a long and tedious process.  The insurance company is going to be sort of a hassle to deal with, but I hope this few pointers will help not having your list sent back to you as they did to me several times.  I forgot to mention, with antiques I just went on the internet and got an estimate of my antiques that I had and I labeled them as clearly and detailed as possible with the value and year of production (roughly).    I wish you all the luck and patience in the world.  I lost my house and my stuff, but my family and I are here and together.  We made it through and in the end that's what matters most.

The best thin we did was get a public adjuster ho went in with his team and catalogued everything in the house. They itemized it and found prices. They dealt with the insurance company and only took 10% of what I got from insurance. This happened in nj so I can't refer you but it was the greatest thing I did. Good luck
ColoradoSprings,2v7qx0,Chadaron,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"One thing to prepare for is the fact that insurance companies may also depreciate everything that is claimed.  My house was burglarized and the one time that we filed a claim, the insurance company depreciates everything that we had. We only ended up receiving a fraction of the true value of what was claimed.  I'm sorry I don't have a helpful tip, but this can come as a shock to people already in a fragile state."

ColoradoSprings,2v708j,Sergei_Potemkin,3,Sun Feb 8 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  The state owns the rights in lots of places, and you are more likely to have a water license ( as in, X number of acre feet from aquifer Y per year ).  In some places you'll need to depend on either municipal water or a cistern.  You need to find this out - water is key here.

ColoradoSprings,2ude7l,chilaxinman,2,Sun Feb 1 06:30:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that is a ""safer"" part of town. The schools have what they call all year schooling (aka pain in the a$$)they start school aug 1st end memorial day week; have 2 weeks off in October and 3weeks at Christmas ghen another 2 at spring break. This may notbe an issue for you but many friend have struggled to find a sitter for the ""extra time"" off or pay full time daycare for the weeks off in October n Spring break. Oh and d49 has MANY more 2 hr delays and closures than other districts in town (rightly so as they tend to get more snow and blowing snow out there) educationally they are a good district but that schedule is harder to manage if you work."

You'll probably be stretching your tank if you skip a decent town under half full, so fill up often. There's not a whole lot along the way so you might want to pack some sandwiches to avoid nasty fast food stops.  Weather should be fine. Just take it easy if you hit snow.

I've made the road trip about 8 times and I-40 takes a bit longer, but it is way safer this time of year, and in my opinion the better of the two routes in general.   If you are driving alone stay the night in Flagstaff. It is about half way and it's a nice town.  Don't stop in Gallup for just about anything other than gas or at the Denny's on I-40.  It always helped me to stop every 1 to 3 hours to top off the gas tank and stretch. It really helped me stay alert which is more important than you might think on a long straight interstate.   A great place to stop (which is a bit off track but in my opinion worth it) is the Hoover Dam. It's a low key stop if you just park in their parking garage and do a self guided tour."
ColoradoSprings,2u77jn,HooliganJVL,1 point,Sat Jan 31 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"I40 across the Colorado Plateau from Flagstaff to ABQ is a drag, especially the section from Flagstaff to Gallup.

ColoradoSprings,2u77jn,jngreenlee,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Colorado Plateau:       The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado.    The Colorado Plateau is largely made up of high desert, with scattered areas of forests. In the southwest corner of the Colorado Plateau lies the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. Much of the Plateau's landscape is related, in both appearance and geologic history, to the Grand Canyon. The nickname ""Red Rock Country"" suggests the brightly colored rock left bare to the view by dryness and erosion. Domes, hoodoos, fins, reefs, goblins, river narrows, natural bridges, and slot canyons are only some of the additional features typical of the Plateau.  The Colorado Plateau has the greatest concentration of U.S. National Park Service (NPS) units in the country. Among its ten National Parks are Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, Arches, Mesa Verde, and Petrified Forest. Among its 17 National Monuments are Dinosaur, Hovenweep, Wupatki, Sunset Crater Volcano, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Natural Bridges, Canyons of the Ancients, and Colorado.

ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,HammerJack,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:26:21 2015 UTC,Maybe if you could start with explaining the difference between a competition range and a lowly hunter range?   edit:   The only real gap I'm seeing in the current offering of gun ranges in and around town are action ranges.
ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,HammerJack,2,Fri Jan 30 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"Nothing ""lowly"" about any other ranges around, I shoot at many of them. I have no ill feeling about any of them either, just wanting something of my own in a area that I enjoy.  What I mean by that is a range that has setup's more for competition shooting with areas that you can walk through and shoot so that you can train like you compete. Have the stand and shoot areas with retractable targets more like an indoor range and then for the longer distance have set targets that are already setup at correct distances.  It would be a place more for the competition shooter then that used by a hunter, not to say hunters would not have a great time at this range, just not so much focus on the stand and shoot setup that most hunters I know use.  Edit: your video is exactly what I am thinking too. For action pistol, 2 and 3 gun, and accuracy competition."
ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Fri Jan 30 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion is to focus solely on the pistol action ranges to get it open as cheaply as possible. That's you're only unique draw. (edit: read more of OP's replies, I know nothing about competition ranges and I think I'd rather keep it that way)  Curious as well if you've been to the Ft. Carson range yet. Anecdotal I know, but I've never seen anyone with a bolt action stand on that range & I have met more people with an anemometer and laser ranging device than any other range. Also dirt cheap, covered benches, and fixed targets to 1000 yards.  Also, as a outdoorsy socially liberal person I'm very iffy on your ecology angle. I am paying you for the proper backstop and lack the authority to do anything about the people doing it wrong so prefer not to waste time being lectured to, or circlejerking about it. If it were that the membership fee was slightly higher to fund an ecology project or that members were required to participate in a project that'd be fine. I just keep rereading that part of your post and feel like you want to be 1/2 gun range owner and 1/2 gun owner apologist. The vast majority already do it right and good luck converting the rednecks out there shooting signs.  All that being said pursue your dream. I'd sign up just to support you in that alone!"
ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,peanutbuttergoodness,2,Fri Jan 30 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"Great comments and I appreciate you taking the time to post them.  We will be very focused on the competition, action shooting, at the first and will open with a smaller stand and shoot area only going to about 200 yards or so. We will have 1 person walk through areas that have set targets and movable obstacles and targets so you can train the way that you want.  I have been to the new Ft Carson range and like it a lot. We even have plans to have benches much like them, with some differences. We cannot at first reach out as far as they can but would have plans to in the future if the members felt it was a need to go that far. Most people would not use that area as that is a great shot even to hit it 1 time.  My environmental stand is that strong because we are just starting out and need everyone to know that we are going to try and do the right thing. We will be making sure that the range is setup for the environment and our members can take satisfaction in that without doing anything. We are not people that would preach at anyone for anything. I want every member to be able to come out and have a great day shooting, no matter if it is their first time or they are a seasoned pro. I feel it is important to let everyone know up-front that we will be a club that does do things to help the environment and that as a member you are not expected to do anything more then enjoy the club and know that we work to make the difference."
ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,BigLou101,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:08:44 2015 UTC,I completely support this and would even pay.  However starting a range is quite expensive.  Keeping it active with competitions takes a fuck ton of time.  You better have some very dedicated people.  There are plenty of pistol matches.  Some rifles matches.  But 3 gun....you gotta travel to find 3 gun.  I think thats your way in.  3 gun matches every other weekend.  Please keep me posted if you gain any traction with this.
ColoradoSprings,2u4o8x,BigLou101,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:40:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the support and comments. The crowdfunding launch is this Sunday and in hopes it all goes well and we are up and going this summer. It is going to be members only because I want a close group that can have a say and not be just open for the  masses. The first competitions are defiantly going to be member only but we may open that at a future date.  3 gun competitions are going to be a big area but we will also have areas that allow you to practice for 3 gun competitions. We are also going to have 2 gun and other type of run and gun activities.

It also directed me to their websites which then gave further information and links so.. that might work?
ColoradoSprings,2u2t0u,phlashko,0,Thu Jan 29 22:04:55 2015 UTC,"Please do not consider Stratus Apartments.

ColoradoSprings,2u0fzt,SlowFoodCannibal,5,Thu Jan 29 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"Technically against the rules, but a lot of people do it.   I think that the biggest concern is that if you hurt yourself at night, search and rescue has to come find you in the dark. If you're going to go, just make sure you have some sort of traction, Barr Trail has been an icy mess lately."
ColoradoSprings,2u0fzt,Chadaron,6,Wed Jan 28 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"It is against the rules, which technically makes it trespassing.  If you are going to do it, be very quiet and courteous of the neighbors. Close doors quietly, lock doors without making your car beep, etc.  This is not a good time of year to go in the dark due to the ice. You are not just putting yourself at risk, but also those who would have to come get you.  Source: have done the Incline 100+ times in all weather and a couple times at night."

You will see a few regulars( usually people who go 2+ times a day) if you go at night too(not to late, maybe 6ish).  Usually the lights from the city and the moon are enough to keep the trail lit, but a headlamp is nice to have just the same since a few spots have holes in the trail, just be sure footed and not stupid, go down at a decent pace.

ColoradoSprings,2tkqll,Artisane,2,Sun Jan 25 05:16:00 2015 UTC,This really can't be stated enough. The sun absolutely dominates how comfortable you feel. When it's 50 and you're in the open you'll be wishing for a pair of shorts. Step around a building into an area that's been shaded all day and you'll be reaching for a coat with gloves. I'm from the midwest and while direct sunlight has an impact it simply can't compare to this altitude.

TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain.  The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (>50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.  The benefit of TENS for pain management is controversial.     Image i     Interesting: Electroanalgesia | Hoffmann's sign | Arthritis | Back pain   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It wasn't terribly busy, but they were busy chatting it up with, what I perceived to be, buddies.   It's common for them not to care about their customers.

ColoradoSprings,2t2hte,Droidball,6,Wed Jan 21 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"There was a surge in gang activity several years ago when the 4th Infantry Division moved up to Fort Carson from Fort Hood, and brought a lot of their gangs with them.  This has dramatically decreased since then, however. I work in law enforcement on Fort Carson, and I haven't heard anything significant about gang activity anywhere in the Springs - I made it a point to ask around when I moved here, because I'd heard like what you've heard."

(Oh, and I lived in the light blue, where I recommend your parents live as well.) Yeah, there's some gang activity in the military. It's frankly not that common... but there's a separate thing. When the 4th Infantry Division came back to Ft. Carson, it brought with it thousands of 18-22 year old kids living on their own for the first time. Strip clubs, bars, shady car dealers, payday loan crooks, hookers, etc... all these people prey on this demographic. If there's one thing an Army base will do to a surrounding area, it's turn it to shit. Usually just the immediate area, at least. Once that base gets a division stationed there, it gets worse.  If you imagine to 50,000+ person frat house... that's an Army division. There are plenty of good guys who keep their nose clean, and there are plenty of questionable types with a bunch of completely disposable income."

The problem worsened slightly during the Surge in Iraq, when the military was throwing money at recruits hand over fist, and taking virtually all comers regardless of criminal history or even potential gang affiliation.  Since then, however, it has much improved due to better investigative techniques by law enforcement, better and more aggressive screening of gang related tattoos, more aggressively prosecuting gang related offenses and discharging the persons involved, and more strict recruitment practices."

It's kind of a complicated thing, but as Droidball said, it's about a Brand.   Not only that but a lot of people who join the military aren't the most upstanding citizens, they have a past, they have their reasons to join.   Recruiters  know this and often smooth out peoples records, get waivers for non-violent crimes, and most people change, and leave the banging life behind.   But some feel the need to keep flying their flag. It's like something that they feel is a part of them. They see a gang more like a family, It's not something you can abandon, and they feel they have duties and obligations to the organization.  But it's not an epidemic by any means, just a inevitability, 1% of any group are going to be the ones that give the other 99% a bad name."
ColoradoSprings,2t2hte,BillieJoeBottleCap,2,Tue Jan 20 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Street gangs are anything but little, much of the time.

That being said this is a good place to live, I have been here for 36 years so far.   A good area for older people like your parents is around Cheyenne Canyon or Old North End. Old North End is going to be your more expensive but neighborhood like experience. Whereas Cheyenne Canyon has houses from the mid $250,000 and up. There are probably cheaper ones around. Old North End really consists of Tejon and Nevada, between Fontanero and Tejon. Whereas Cheyenne Canyon and the surrounding neighborhood is like the map r/jngreenlee posted as the ""1% lives here"".

ColoradoSprings,2t2hte,raiderato,-4,Sun Jan 25 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, your parents are aware of Colorado Springs' conservative reputation. You mentioned Massachusetts and Boulder which are both very progressive as far as I know. Colorado Springs is the opposite. The taxes are very low here, but our services show it. Roads are poorly maintained and most of the city looks like a ghetto. It is a prime example the statement ""you get what you pay for."""
ColoradoSprings,2t2hte,danfrey,5,Sun Jan 25 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"A ghetto? Come on, you obviously have never been in a real ghetto."

ColoradoSprings,2t2hte,danfrey,0,Tue Mar 31 03:14:19 2015 UTC,"The roads here are not maintained, pot holes here can swallow a small car. Snow removal is a joke. Street lights were shut off to save electricity. Garbage cans were removed from the parks because of a lack of funds to pay for their upkeep. We have a population of over half a million and yet the city doesn't provide trash services. Roadway medians go unmowed and unwatered. It is common to see unmaintained backyard fences along a roadway with large patches of weeds between the fence and the road. aka Airport Rd.  The city is better maintained in newer neighborhoods, but the true character of this city becomes clear when you see areas like B street, Airport and Murray, Fountain and Murray, etc. The city managent here treats the city like a child with toys. As soon as a new neighborhood pops up, older neighborhoods are abandoned to become run down. There is far more to a city than the latest McMansion neighborhood being promoted by local developers.  Colorado Springs suffers from low taxes, a large transient population of young military members, and city planning controlled by local developers."

ColoradoSprings,2t0pud,jngreenlee,10,Tue Jan 20 05:02:57 2015 UTC,"According to the Economist's Big Mac Index (others feel free to provide more helpful sources), 1 NZD equals 1.19 USD in purchasing power, although the current exchange rate is (was?) 1.15 at time of indexing. http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index  This would imply that your purchases of NZD 1000, so if you use this measure, you'd need 1190 USD to make the same amount of purchases. This of course will very greatly depending on what you're actually buying. For example, petrol (gasoline) might be far cheaper, but wool socks might be much more expensive. Bring your own woolies for sure.  Colorado Springs is solidly in the US average for cost of living, so this comparison should be enough. However, you'll see that some categories, such as housing are higher than average, while others are lower. For more data, use: http://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/colorado-springs-co/brentwood-tn/100000  The single biggest item you better examine individual should be housing. If the NZD spend included rent/mortgage, then back that out of the calculation above and replace with the results of your housing research at craigslist.org.  Next, you should examine the transportation cost. You'll need a car. Will you bring your own via shipping, or sell yours there and buy here? Look at craigslist again and budget accordingly.  If you don't have a job (yet), and you have to sign a lease, that will be difficult, as landlords want to see proof of income. At a minimum you better have 12x monthly living expenses saved up and provable.   Finally, what about the work visa? Have you looked into the regulations on that? I don't think you can come here and just look for a job, unless NZ has a special status with the US.  Good luck and plan carefully!"

Colorado, I think is a lot prettier than New England (except the fall, but that's a given).   I had a ton of fun. There was always stuff to do. An hour drive seems like a long way when you're from New England (ugh, Boston? Fuck. I have to pack and sack lunch and a change of clothes and everything...), but after living there for a bit a drive up to Denver is the kind of thing you can swing on a whim.

So I was just topping off the radiator with a mixture of antifreeze and water. No big deal. I'm looking for a car, just need it to limp along a little bit longer.   Here comes the end of November when the temp got down to negative whatever. Drove it in from work running just fine. Wake up the next morning and it's turning over with a really bad noise and won't hit a lick.  My guess is I got a little too high on my water to antifreeze ratio and possibly cracked a head. I can't be sure because I have put zero effort into finding out. It just has the sound of a dead engine.   That being said, motors for that sell all over the place for around $200-400 and its a manual... so that'll never give up the ghost.   For 200 bucks if you can get, you can have it."

I bought my current car from them used  and had to argue with them to fix a dent in it and paint it or lower the price. It was ridiculous especially because this was after I caught the salesperson lying and got a huge apology from the management.
ColoradoSprings,2ss908,kettnert,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:49:09 2015 UTC,"I need the key itself programmed. If you already have 2, you can do a third yourself.  My first issue with them is that we bought the car as a CPO, and it came with one key. We tried to work another key with the sales guy, and he eventually just stopped returning our calls or emails. The final straw was when I took it in to get the oil changed a couple weeks ago when it was balls cold. I asked about getting a plain key for it (it's primarily my wife's car, so I dont need another switchblade key) and the 18 year old service coordinator told me that I could only get the ($200+) switchblade key for it. I knew that was not true. Then he came in a little while later and tried to tell me that my month old snow tires were worn and needed rotated. I laughed in his face and told him absolutely not.     Anyway, I called this place yesterday and left a message but never got a call back http://carkeypro.com/"
ColoradoSprings,2ss908,kettnert,1 point,Sun Jan 18 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"With the way keys have microchips and lots of programming in them now I would take the car to another Mazda dealership (just because one has poor service does not mean the others do) because I have seen a lot of instances where 3rd party key makers and programmers make a small mistake that lead to extremely obnoxious instances (eg. the car alarm going off despite the key being the correct key or turning on randomly mid drive).   Also those switchblade keys are so much more fragile. I am not a fan of them. My suggestion is next time do not purchase the car until you come to a written and legal agreement with the dealer even if it is over something minor like a spare key.  I am also a mechanic and know how some of the management at dealerships and auto shops force employees to try and get money out of you no matter what. However, there are still plenty of places where we are honest and won't force you into a corner. Makes me sad to see a group of people giving us a poor reputation."

Nice restaurant if you're going out downtown one night.  I've heard really mixed things about Momma Pearl's in Rockrimmon.  They have good deals on Amazon local but I haven't got to try them yet."

ColoradoSprings,2sbjgf,peanutbuttergoodness,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"As a Network Admin, who has used both, I've gotta say I prefer Comcast over CenturyLink. Comcast has a much more stable infrastructure, with more responsive DNS servers, they have newer switches, and they provide the better speed for price ratio.  Not to mention, their customer service is much much better.  My experiences with CenturyLink have never been good. When we first moved to our new house, we were offered a great deal on the 105MBPS package from Comcast, so we got that. In 2 years, it never lost connection, speed tests always revealed we were getting our moneys worth. A couple years later, I was between jobs so we switched to CenturyLink to save a few bucks, and the first 2 months of our service with them I had to place at least 15 calls before they had it working stable and at the speed I was paying for. After that, everytime there was any sort of storm us, and everyone on our block would lose connection, constantly.   Recently, we have switched back to Comcast, and now have the 50MBPS package, and it's still as rock solid as before, and I'm actually getting the speeds I'm paying for. CenturyLink, in my experience, has always had a hard time delivering what they advertise on."

ColoradoSprings,2s37rp,WardJ,1 point,Sun Jan 11 22:06:44 2015 UTC,This might sound like a stupid question but does it Colorado springs get a lot of hail?
ColoradoSprings,2s37rp,WardJ,1 point,Sun Jan 11 23:19:14 2015 UTC,Yep. We moved here from the east coast in May and it was surprising. Seemed to get a good hail storm once or twice a week all summer long. Seems like everyone in our neighborhood had their roofs repaired/replaced at the start of Fall. There's hail damage repair places all over.

I've been turned away a few times but I've learned to call and ask how the wait time looks. It's always worth the bit of extra effort because she does a great job and is much cheaper than anywhere else I have found.

Call the local cab companies and offer a reward to the driver who finds it ($50) and the dispatcher on duty when it's found ($50)... for $100 the dispatchers will routinely remind the drivers of the car that is stolen... and the drivers will find your car faster than police because they cover more of the city in a faster amount of time than police, also, they are more likely to be going in areas where stolen cars would likely be."

ColoradoSprings,2rsalm,Bloomsday1972,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:54:52 2015 UTC,Stickers are relatively easy to remove. A bottle of goo gone and a razor would do it. I bought a car a while back and it had two NRA stickers on it. I own guns and support the second amendment but I don't want to advertise that fact on my car. It took me about an hour to scrape them off.   If you stole a car that'd be the first thing you'd do right? Make it less recognizable?
ColoradoSprings,2rsalm,Bloomsday1972,5,Fri Jan 9 15:13:15 2015 UTC,Will certainly look out for that. I am so sorry that happened to you guys :(

North of Woodmen Rd and south of Research Blvd will be structures built within the 80's. North of Research is more like 90's and present, if that helps at all. Good luck!

ColoradoSprings,2rirnx,MrJoseGigglesIII,4,Thu Jan 15 14:20:59 2015 UTC,She was a fringe candidate at best and had zero chance of getting elected.  I have heard about her in the real estate community. Crazy stories. Add one more to the list I suppose.

Westside and Downtown areas are best for bike-oriented travel, and the main bike friendly lanes and off-street biking routes converge in those areas. Housing is not too hard to find if you are buying, rentals are pretty tight. Westside/Downtown again have the greatest diversity in architecture as they are the oldest areas, and a good cultural mix, too. Out east and up north is mostly cookie-cutter development and big box stores. Farmers markets through the summer and locally owned business year round are easily accessible by bike in the Westside/Downtown area. Cost of living is decent, air is clean, people are friendly, and if you don't mind living in a primarily very conservatively Republican county (it's frustrating at times) then CoSpgs is a great place to live."

We tend to focus on similarities until we know someone well..in Austin and Portland we welcome bearded hippies and the general movement away from interference with private life, and are happy when public dollars are spent well. With conservatives, we tend to focus on the importance of letting people choose where to put their dollars, and having less currency manipulation.

Water is sometimes included but electric/gas is almost always separate through CSU. Depending on the place you rent, trash and other fees might be tacked on as a flat rate.  Generally the only time you'll find included utilities, you're looking at an overpriced rental, or it's just a shared unit and the landlord is too lazy to split it.  Rental places are in much higher demand because of the large vagrant migrant military crowd that come and go too quickly to bother buying.  If you're going to buy, look for somewhere that's going to appreciate fast. Powers Boulevard is a hotspot right now (don't quote me on it though). Ultimately you will probably be better off buying if you plan on staying a while."

ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,tolos,13,Wed Dec 31 19:03:03 2014 UTC,"1) Static friction is more sticky than moving friction. Spinning your tires does nothing to get your car moving. Stop them spinning then slowly add power to the wheels to get some momentum.  2) Depending on the age of your car's battery you may need a new one or a stronger one. Slow starts in the winter are normal.  3) All that extra snow and ice pack on your car adds weight that your engine has to get moving and your brakes have to stop. Yes, get it off if you can.  4) Which tires did you buy? All seasons will be fine in town. You probably don't want to go to a ski resort or anywhere in the mountains with them.  5) Wash your car when you feel like it. We use an atypical road salt here that is not so bad on your car. You'll feel like you wasting your time and money if you wash it before the roads are dry again.  6) Try to get some wiper fluid that stays liquid at colder temps. There's gobs to choose from.  7) No one really cares where the lanes are when they are covered in snow. If there are drier looking paths, then use them. Be careful though as there is often black ice in what look like dry spots.  8) Other things to be aware of:   Stopping is harder than you think; slow down and use your engine (downshift) to go down steeper hills rather than using your brakes. This goes back to number 1; friction is your friend. If you do start sliding/skidding then just take your foot off of the accelerator. Don't use your brakes until you have your direction corrected. Braking during a skid usually makes it worse. Don't tailgate; some people have better tires and snow driving skills than you do and can stop quickly. Stopping going uphill is not a good idea on snow or ice; try to avoid it. Different parts of town get different types and amounts of snow; be prepared for the worst. A blanket and water in your car is a good idea if you plan to travel anywhere. Keep an eye on your spare tire; a flat spare is worthless."

ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,Klynn7,3,Wed Dec 31 19:03:09 2014 UTC,"I just want to say while the other guys have provided mostly good feedback, I tend to disagree with the engine braking recommendations, especially in an fwd car.  If you're really bad at working your brake pedal it might be good because it's going to be a subtle amount of braking, but it's only going to use two of your four contact patches to slow down.  Your brake pedal will use all 4, which if you can be gentle enough to not break loose into a slide, will stop you faster 100% of the time."
ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,megman13,2,Thu Jan 1 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"I'd mostly agree with you with FWD and RWD cars, although engine braking can be used as a useful tool in conjunction with braking- you can use it to keep from picking up too much speed on a downhill, for example. However, when it gets REALLY slick, you can cause yourself to lose traction just by downshifting and letting the clutch out, regardless of your drivetrain. I don't endorse using a stick as superior to brakes as objective fact, just a trick I find useful and (in some circumstances on my own AWD vehicle) sometimes a better option than braking. Learn your own car and how it responds in certain conditions, and use  your own best judgement (based in fact)."
ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,megman13,2,Thu Jan 1 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"To answer some of your specific questions: You may want to remove ice/snow buildup from your wheel wells, especially if you don't garage your car overnight. If it freezes solid overnight it will scrape when you go over bumps or turn.  They do make winter windshield fluid, usually rated  to -20F. It's pretty much all I use Nov-Mar.  For lines/lanes, do your best. If you drive a route daily hopefully you know where the lanes are. If not, follow where you think they would be and the tire tracks of others to the best of your ability.  Copy and paste of a comments I made a while back:   SLOW DOWN. This doesn't just mean speed, this means your acceleration and deceleration too. Brake early. Begin braking well ahead of when you normally would. Get a feel for the road conditions before assuming you can stop. When accelerating, do so gradually. If your wheels start sliding/spinning, let off the gas. Static friction is greater than dynamic friction- this means you get a LOT more traction when your wheels are rolling across the ground instead of sliding against it. Letting off the gas will get you better grip when you lose traction, more gas will only make things worse. It's counter-intuitive, but it's faster to stop by letting OFF the brakes and then re-applying them once the wheels are rolling than to stand on your brake pedal and lock up the wheels. If you begins slipping, focus on regaining traction- take your foot off whatever pedal is on. Continue to aim your wheels where you want the vehicle to go, and keep your feet off of the pedals until you recover from the skid. Plan ahead. Sometimes, shit happens. Plan your movements accordingly. If you're sliding down a hill and cannot stop your vehicle,  but can still steer, it's probably going to be better to steer into a curb and mess up your alignment than to rear-end another car and damage both vehicles. Remember that even if you cannot stop, there are other options. Stomping on the brakes while you slide down a  hill sideways isn't going to help anyone, maintain what control you can instead of giving it all up and laying into the brakes. I have seen NUMEROUS accidents caused by people locking up their wheels and sliding down a hill with no control, where they might have been able to  control the vehicle and avoid obstacles had the wheels been turning and had traction. On uphills- get some speed up. Not tons, but keep your speed higher than you would going downhill or on a level. Once you start losing traction going uphill, if you can't recover it, it's only a matter of time until you start sliding backwards. This is also courteous for the drivers behind you who may lose traction going uphill.   Personal opinions which may or may not be true:  I like having a standard transmission in snow. You can downshift  to slow down, and especially  in  an AWD vehicle, this seems to be more effective at slowing down than braking in severe conditions (let this also serve  to show how early you need to plan ahead to brake in extremely slippery conditions). I also like to practice in ice/snow whenever possible. An empty parking  lot (EMPTY- no light posts, curbs, lane dividers, etc) can help you practice recovering from skids, as well as becoming more comfortable in a skid. The more comfortable you are, the less likely you are to freeze up when the shit hits the fan.  Now, go buy a Subaru, you're in Colorado now.  *edit to clarify slipping vs rolling- had used ""spinning"" to describe both.  *edit 2: /u/oyp mentiond this below: Brake before turning. To expand on that:   Braking and accelerating should all be done separately from turning. Any of these actions alone will shift your weight and traction, and doing a combination of them will reduce traction to most of your tires. Braking and accelerating should be done before and after a turn, so slow down to the speed you need to be at to go around a turn BEFORE you get there. If, on the other hand, you want to practice skidding, combing braking and turning or rapid acceleration in the middle of the turn will  both put you into a skid very effectively.   ***Further edit: A good pair of snow/winter tires can make a world of difference. A 2WD car with good snow tires can make an AWD/4WD car with all seasons (or, heaven forbid, some kind of summer/racing tires) look like a fool. If you can afford to get a spare set of tires for half the year, I'd do it. It's also only slightly cheaper than buying an AWD car (but seriously, get a Subaru)."
ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,kbreezy04,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:10:20 2014 UTC,Biggest thing is to just go slower.  I've been driving in snow for 15 years and I still curbed my rim today and messed up my alignment because I was stupid and didn't slow down enough for a turn....go slow.
ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,BriPerson,1 point,Wed Dec 31 22:14:33 2014 UTC,"Just wanna add on the first question.  Start driving from second gear when on patches of ice or slippery snow, etc. Slower acceleration will help the sliding. I drive a standard too. Also... I avoid the hill on Union between Briargate and Academy as much as possible during these conditions. But this is because I've been driving a manual for only a few months now."
ColoradoSprings,2qxxqv,Jesus359,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:08:49 2014 UTC,"Yes. Start on 2nd gear. Been driving i. The snow for 2+ years with a manual vehicle. On hills something I would highly highly recommend is keep it on 2nd or 3rd gear depending on traffic and keep a steady pace. Don't break or accelerate. This will cause you to loose control when covered in snow.  Also, like stated above, find an empty parking lot with lots of spaces. Go fast and push on the brake, use the e-break to stop all 4 tires and stop quicker. Find what to do and what not to do. PM if you would like some locations of good empty parking lots.   Edit: adding details."

There is the ""normal"" winter closure of trails which I neglected to take in to account, although I believe the road itself remains open? In any case, the access from Garden of the Gods is still open.  The damage to the road has been repaired, but due to the Waldo Burn Scar and the highly erodible nature of burn scars, there is concern that the road may suffer higher-than-normal erosion, especially in Spring runoff and Summer monsoon season. This explains the closure  of the portion I was referring to, and what I've heard about possible plans to re-close that portion."

ColoradoSprings,2qtjnz,grilledsheez,2,Tue Dec 30 19:12:14 2014 UTC,Remind me in a couple weeks when the snow is gone.
ColoradoSprings,2qrdpq,jktaylor2,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:40:48 2014 UTC,"Also empty parking lots, big space, snow drifting and practice snow driving."
ColoradoSprings,2qrdpq,Jesus359,2,Tue Dec 30 08:38:07 2014 UTC,"I went to the chapel hills mall and me (Subaru AWD ) and another guy in a Ford Ranger were doing just this. it was more fun than trivia, I can say for sure"
ColoradoSprings,2qrdpq,BaubNull,1 point,Tue Dec 30 13:40:14 2014 UTC,Never!!!!!
ColoradoSprings,2qrdpq,BaubNull,1 point,Tue Dec 30 14:28:08 2014 UTC,"Ha!   ;)    Tell you what, I'll pick you up one night after your games and take you for a spin, then tell me which gave you the most fun.  I'll even make it challenging for myself, wait until a nice hot day in summer when roads are dry and I'll use a heavy truck."

ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,7faces,6,Mon Dec 29 21:28:46 2014 UTC,Check out Cottonwood Creek park. That's where I always went sledding as a kid.
ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,Erpverts,3,Tue Dec 30 00:09:26 2014 UTC,"Seconding this, whenever it snows there's a good mass of people sledding there. Not exactly a well-serviced touristy place, but it's a good hill in a safe neighborhood."
ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,OfficerNelson,2,Tue Dec 30 01:13:40 2014 UTC,Awesome.  We will.
ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,grilledsheez,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:36:10 2014 UTC,"Still gonna be pretty cold tomorrow, so double socks! (That's what I did when I sled here as a kiddo)"
ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,alt00174,2,Tue Dec 30 09:14:15 2014 UTC,"Cottonwood is definitely good, especially for younger kiddos. Check out the hill next to the YMCA/playground area."
ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,SurferGurl,1 point,Tue Dec 30 17:24:26 2014 UTC,We ended up checking this place out but there was fencing to close to the end of the slopes their.  We parked by the ymca center so I don't know if there was another spot that we may have missed.

ColoradoSprings,2qqy97,CoSunny,2,Mon Dec 29 21:43:59 2014 UTC,If ur going to the the springs area u should try the cave of the winds. And if the kids r under 8 u could go to the north pole
ColoradoSprings,2qqw7n,TheLazyLife,2,Mon Dec 29 21:11:55 2014 UTC,"My brother, myself, and our wives are going to the show at Ivywild that night:  http://ivywildschool.ticketfly.com/event/734339/  Probably one of the cheaper events I've seen, and there's great local beer!"
ColoradoSprings,2qqw7n,gnikcals,1 point,Tue Dec 30 16:50:41 2014 UTC,Cool! Might check it out. Someone also recommended that I go to Cowboys.
ColoradoSprings,2qqw7n,Br4hm4,2,Tue Dec 30 17:05:20 2014 UTC,Wobbly Olive has probably the best deal I have heard so far...$40 all you can drink Martini's and Mac and Cheese Bar.
ColoradoSprings,2qqw7n,Chadaron,2,Tue Dec 30 17:19:40 2014 UTC,"One unique new year's offering that we have are fireworks on top of Pike's Peak. Each year, the AdAmAn club hikes to the top of the mountain and sets off fireworks at midnight. You can see it from anywhere in the city and is pretty neat. Not really a social event, but worth checking out!"
