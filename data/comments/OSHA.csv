OSHA,3e359t,kash51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:19 2015 UTC,In a lot of situations overhead for the whole operation is higher than the cost of equipment rental so in that way it's better to spend the money to have it in case you need it because downtime would cost you more than the cost of rental. It just has to be a feasible liability. Some equipment I work with cost 1500 or more an hour with a 10 hour daily minimum. Never mind the mobilization fee of hundreds of thousands to get it on location. Equipment like that isn't usually a feasible liability.

OSHA,3dui0e,Doofe_N7,6,Sun Jul 19 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Russian engineers are fantastic when they're trying to be. AK-47 rifle and T-34 tank, anyone? Still in active service today with many countries. It's just that they tend not to care about things like safety and comfort as much as we do in the U.S. and Europe."
OSHA,3dui0e,DJWalnut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:55 2015 UTC,"Soyuz is approximately as safe as the space shuttle was. then again, they played it fast and loose with safety on the space shuttle."
OSHA,3dui0e,jonythunder,0,Mon Jul 20 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"I could argue about safety. Military technology? Sure, safety WAS (USSR) not that much of an issue before, because Stalin saw soldiers as nothing more than expendable numbers. However, let me stress things here, in the US space program during the cold war safety was more of an issue than in the USSR. Russians where using for most of the race tried and trusted technologies, always improving on them, while the US created different vehicles every time. Of course, both methods are viable, but one has a bigger focus on safety while the other has it on cutting-edge technology. Also, there's a big difference between early NASA astronauts and soviet cosmonauts: the first where test pilots, soldiers, while the later where engineers and scientists. This led to the USSR putting more trust in their cosmonauts, which led to the seemingly inferior safety of their vessels, which, when manned by someone with knowledge, where far safer than US vehicles"

OSHA,3dui0e,d114,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"The bridge itself, is structurally sound (sans guardrail) for the moment.  What the posts are holding, appears to be a 150d PVC conduit which was originally attached to the inside (likely hung from the deck as the beam is pretensioned).  You can tell by the sag and the ''member'' spacing that it's a thin walled plastic with something heavy and warm inside.  It's probably the electrical for the bridge lighting.  Winters are harsh over there and salt mist will get on the steel and cause the spalling on the composite deck.  The pretensioned member built in factory conditions looks fine."
OSHA,3dui0e,honorman81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:02 2015 UTC,Does anybody actually believe that those shitty little boards are holding the weight of that heavy steel and concrete bridge?

The guy at my local Praxair says it's illegal to transport them laying down with no cap. As to what law I have no idea. I have transported them laying down but it was always strapped with a 4x4 between each tank so they weren't banging into each other.

OSHA,3ds7wc,compdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:48 2015 UTC,I wrap it around the stem with the burst disc.  The rope is caught between the neck of the bottle and the burst disc so it can't slide up to turn the valve.

OSHA,3ds7wc,Lifeguard2012,12,Sun Jul 19 03:21:03 2015 UTC,Ideally vertically in a fixed cage that protects them. That's how supply companies do it. Having said that I've transported them many times laying down. The biggest thing is to install the steel shipping cap over the valve (guess what it's designed for!?) and strap the tanks down so they don't move around. I also aim them towards the rear just in case. Chances of launching are minuscule but I'd rather not find out I'm that .001%

There are flammability signs, and there are oxidizer signs. A flammable agent is flammable itself. An oxidizing agent can cause a fire in process to run away. One of the major tactics of firefighting is air depravation. Firefighting in the presence of an oxidizer relies on separate tactics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle#Oxidizer ."
OSHA,3ds7wc,Cyeric85,2,Sun Jul 19 16:53:51 2015 UTC,Some oxidizing agents don't need a fire in progress to be utterly fucking terrifyingly dangerous. Chlorine Trifluoride will make glass or sand burn. Here various items of safety equipment are exposed to it. It's main use these days is making Uranium Hexafluoride when refining Uranium ore. You know something is pretty dangerous when you can add Uranium to it and it becomes safer.
OSHA,3ds7wc,spud4,5,Mon Jul 20 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I heard a story at work the other day.  When they were up north working on the pipelines, they used to take full oxygen or nitrogen bottles out on to the ice, point them away, and snap the valves off."
OSHA,3ds7wc,what-the-f---,7,Sun Jul 19 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"DOT Regs would consider this ""personal use."" So the DOT and PIPELINE wouldnt even bother, as for calling the police they would tell the guy to strap them in since most cops have no clue of the regulations that Pipeline and the DOT have in place. the green is most likely Oxygen and the Black is most likely acetylene, as for the red its probably an inert gas like Argon or similar for welding."
OSHA,3ds7wc,Dreyyy,2,Sun Jul 19 03:14:39 2015 UTC,Personal use or not.! and the white is probably propane. With a home made regulator still attached with hose still on Green one red hose attached no regulator or gauges. The cap is there but looks like hose is still attached  Acetylene needs to be up right for 1 hour before you can use it!  So why not use that time to do it right  If they are empty how would you even refill that. Around here the refill stations would not even touch those. They have the right and responsibilities to refuse service to anyone. I have hauled them laying down but damn not like this

OSHA,3diuoi,fb39ca4,45,Thu Jul 16 19:52:44 2015 UTC,Properly labeled improper emergency equipment.
OSHA,3diuoi,CyberSunburn,18,Thu Jul 16 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"How are you supposed to label jiffy pop used as a crude thermometer?   Edit: maybe something like ""when this is cooked you will be too"""
OSHA,3diuoi,shoelie,33,Thu Jul 16 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, even if they had an actual extinguisher/alarm or whatnot, all properly labeled and to code, they would still fail?"
OSHA,3diuoi,KorbenD2263,44,Thu Jul 16 18:25:17 2015 UTC,"Can be a couple of things.. Say there is an alarm pull box back there. By code it is obstructed and even if it is easily accessible still in violation, just from the looks of it there is nothing behind it so at that point it is an improper labeling violation. I rarely fail an inspection because you want to keep the customer for the next annual inspection I will more than likely just tell to them to remove even if it is a joke or I will write a report in which either we fix it as a tech or they fix and take all responsibility and then we issue their certs.   Only difference is, I deal with ships/boats/yachts.  But our inspection of service and marine go hand in hand for code and regualtions."
OSHA,3diuoi,DJSwindleDeez,54,Thu Jul 16 18:49:41 2015 UTC,I rarely fail an inspection because you want to keep the customer for the next annual inspection   This sounds so wrong.
OSHA,3diuoi,Dasmage,15,Thu Jul 16 20:33:44 2015 UTC,There is a lot more red tape than just saying you failed for whatever reasoning. Depending on extinguisher condition and we have to replace with new or service them then yes technically they fail. If their alarm panel is in trouble and I have to write a report for an electrician to come out and troubleshoot yes they fail until the problem is fixed. Now I have stopped a boat from sailing because things have not been up to code  to my standards they get pissy but with what my job is dealing with then it has to be done. Fail was more so the wrong choice of words because it falls under a few different categories.   Certification expires is more the term to use on most of not all that I've been. Now what Coast Guard or ABS says after I've done my inspection is on them.
OSHA,3diuoi,DJSwindleDeez,3,Thu Jul 16 21:13:18 2015 UTC,It sounds like you have reasonable discretion. Nothing crazy sounding about that unless there's safety issues being ignored.
OSHA,3diuoi,dubblix,8,Thu Jul 16 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"I care for the customers money but if it puts them in danger then I will write it up. There are limits on everything that I inspect.   With that being said I have worked with some techs that will fail most bottles because of small discrepancies that no one would fail and come back and say ""it gets us more money."" While I see that persons point, I do not agree with it in the least because I believe it has a damaging effect on our customer especially if they are one of our smaller customers that can't afford to service 10+ extinguishers at a time."
OSHA,3diuoi,DJSwindleDeez,15,Fri Jul 17 00:12:52 2015 UTC,I can't imagine a guy named DJSwindleDeez being a safety inspector.   Oh shit here he comes he's going to swindle deez jiffy pop fire detectors.

OSHA,3diuoi,moeburn,3,Thu Jul 16 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"If the building is on fire enough to warrant that amount panic, they probably already know about it. At that point you should just forget the alarm and get out"

OSHA,3diuoi,moeburn,8,Thu Jul 16 20:29:21 2015 UTC,What if they labeled it a fire detector instead of a fire alarm?

OSHA,3diuoi,pitillidie,5,Fri Jul 17 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"So I am anal retentive and a self important douche because 1. I care about my job? 2. Care that I take all inspections seriously 3. Or that because I deal with peoples lives may it be indirect that I'm looking out for them. How about if you read the rest of my responses you would have seen what steps would be taken to take care of the issue even if isn't that big. But hey, I'm a douche."
OSHA,3diuoi,DJSwindleDeez,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:42:15 2015 UTC,You are a douche because saying you would fail someone for a joke over the internet when you aren't even this is in now way proof for anything you have said.

OSHA,3diuoi,shoelie,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:24 2015 UTC,Without a doubt. Some of my local fire houses have alarm equipment that hasn't seen an upgrade since the Nixon administration.
OSHA,3diuoi,OutInTheBlack,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:54 2015 UTC,In my experience being a firefighter in no way qualifies one to assess fire protection systems

OSHA,3dkmi3,TheBananaKing,8,Fri Jul 17 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"I was once involved in the stand-up of a new facility. The way our company works is that individual programs ""rent"" floor space from the facility (even though the company owns both). We submitted multiple facility requests for fire extinguishers because facility safety said we needed them. However, the facility wanted the program to pay for them. Their rationale was ""If you weren't working there, the extinguishers wouldn't be needed.""  Let's reiterate the situation:    Facility safety requires us to have extinguishers Facility operations won't pay for extinguishers because they wouldn't be needed if the engineering program wasn't using the space Engineering is paying ""rent"" for the floorspace Engineering actually brings in money, ultimately paying all the facility workers' wages   It took us 6 months to get 2 fire extinguishers delivered and mounted on the walls."

OSHA,3dkmi3,jeremiahfelt,4,Fri Jul 17 01:06:26 2015 UTC,"This is not an emergency exit.  This is a utility access door for the plant equipment in the well.  There should be an escape away from this door, and behind another closed door (area of refuge or safe haven) with the site standpipe.  The utility well should also have an escape route."
OSHA,3dkmi3,StaySkyWalking,5,Fri Jul 17 11:54:46 2015 UTC,But being a fire door means it should be kept closed unless it's held open by some kind of automatic release in case of a fire correct? This is what I'm going to school for and I know there is some grey area that's left up to interpretation so I'm just curious.
OSHA,3dkmi3,jeremiahfelt,4,Fri Jul 17 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Since this is a fire door segmenting a utility space from an occupied space, it should generally be closed.  Fire doors which segment an occupied space from an occupied space or a thoroughfare (hallway) should be held open mechanically or electronically and closed when the alarm system goes off."
OSHA,3dkmi3,timmeh87,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"Well given that the door leads to the ""plant room"" and is behind a secret panel, I seriously doubt that it an emergency exit. Maybe for the people in the plant room, but they can probably also just open the door from that side."

OSHA,3dew5z,xblackdog,48,Wed Jul 15 20:07:12 2015 UTC,Came here to say this exactly. I started operating heavy equipment when I was 8. You can be just as good if mature enough.
OSHA,3dew5z,Monte0704,18,Thu Jul 16 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"Same.  My dad had me running the dozer before I was a teenager.  By the time I got my driver's license, I was a damn good operator."

OSHA,3dew5z,another_know_it_all,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:25 2015 UTC,Sry I was just joking. One thing I have done though is flying a tiny airplane when I was 15.
OSHA,3dew5z,ismellpancakes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Haha, no worries, mate.  I've never flown a plane, but I'd imagine it's quite a bit more complicated than operating a bulldozer (not to mention life-threatening, at least for the operator).  And at 15!  Kudos :)"
OSHA,3dew5z,DarkDubzs,9,Fri Jul 17 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, me too. First time on the tractor with the hay rake at 8."

For a week straight when I was 11 I would be pulling a 3 bottom plow behind our tractor to get rid of a certain weed. Not many 11 year olds can say they pulled a 40 hour work week on a tractor after school."
OSHA,3dew5z,DarkDubzs,4,Thu Jul 16 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"At 8 years old I was sitting on my dad's lap in the driver's seat of his truck and tried to drive, (didn't reach the pedals but partly steered), but I always though it would be hysterical to try and steer into a car or house. I wasn't too sharp."
OSHA,3dew5z,rollcoal,8,Thu Jul 16 08:28:02 2015 UTC,This. My first thought when I saw it. Too many are pussies today and want lawyers along with the government and insurance agents to sort everything out and suffocate everyone in a blanket of laws and regulations.

OSHA,3dew5z,Captain_Nipples,31,Thu Jul 16 08:39:51 2015 UTC,"The machines are designed to be easy to use, just takes a lot of practice to get smooth with them. I think most kids these days would learn much quicker too since the controls and hand eye required are similar to video games.   I started operating equipment in my early teens. Like others have said I'd be much quicker to trust a skilled child who's scared of screwing up over a hung over operator that doesn't respect the equipment. I've dealt with some shit operators in my time."
OSHA,3dew5z,thetoastmonster,9,Wed Jul 15 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard rumors they use kids to design flight controls for next gen aircraft because their the ones using it. It's believable enough, especially considering I went on a field trip to Honeywell in ~3rd grade and flew a flight simulator. Some lady had a clipboard after and asked me questions about what we would change, why, natural resting positions, etc. Makes me want to get into a new fighter jet and feel the controls. This was around '93 and 10/10 would do again."
OSHA,3dew5z,GillicuttyMcAnus,37,Thu Jul 16 03:03:44 2015 UTC,I ran dozers as a kid. Got a D8 high-centered on a tree I'd just pushed down.  My parents would have probably killed my grandfather of they knew the shit he let me do before I was 10.

OSHA,3dew5z,ToastyJoe,32,Wed Jul 15 21:30:12 2015 UTC,So he ran over a tree?
OSHA,3dew5z,Captain_Nipples,55,Wed Jul 15 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, and then got it stuck."
OSHA,3dew5z,ducksarewet,6,Wed Jul 15 21:39:47 2015 UTC,Thank you
OSHA,3dew5z,Fab500,20,Thu Jul 16 05:27:06 2015 UTC,Yeah.. neither track was touching the ground except at the back.. and I'd dug a big enough rut there that I wasn't getting enough traction.. Had to be pulled out.
OSHA,3dew5z,Dont-be_an-Asshole,4,Wed Jul 15 21:49:32 2015 UTC,D8s are often used to plow over trees/rocks (our mine uses them all the time for road/firebreak construction) so that isn't unusual. Getting stuck is the unusual (but easily possible) part.
OSHA,3dew5z,joeljaeggli,2,Thu Jul 16 13:41:26 2015 UTC,Basically.

I'm glad he was being supervised and not near power lines. Still have to consider what's below ground. Even pros make mistakes. Pg&E just accidentally ruptured their own natural gas line while digging."
OSHA,3dew5z,LikeNobodyBidness,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:46 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy to hit a gas line when you're trying to dig it up.  It's pretty hard to hit a gas line when the adult supervision has you digging a hundred yards from the nearest utility.
OSHA,3dew5z,TheEvilGerman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:57:32 2015 UTC,It would've been off or empty if they were doing that. It was an accident that could've been prevented.

The employees were drilling and replacing soil as part of the process. While drilling they struck a natural gas line.''

OSHA,3d8uyl,Zachary9,5,Tue Jul 14 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"Let's see, a fork lift used to lift something in a country where OSHA has no jurisdiction? Yup, post it here OP!"
OSHA,3d8uyl,vne2000,3,Thu Jul 16 05:29:21 2015 UTC,I've changed tires like this.. It's more safe than a bumper jack or those bullshit scissor jacks that come with cars.  It's not like you have to get underneath the truck..  Another thing.. These things are designed not to fall unexpectedly.
OSHA,3d8uyl,Captain_Nipples,2,Tue Jul 14 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"I did this when I had to fix the e-brake on the box truck at work, and that is much heavier. I also had to kinda get under it a little."

OSHA,3d8uyl,Luke_Fletcher,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:36:20 2015 UTC,Saw this? Or did this before leaving work to post on Reddit?
OSHA,3dbebs,The_Guy_Downstairs,8,Tue Jul 14 23:30:55 2015 UTC,You want that job? If not there are 10 other guys that will climb that derrick and grease those bearings just waiting outside the gate. Get your ass up there and get to work!
OSHA,3dbebs,stex5150,3,Wed Jul 15 16:55:32 2015 UTC,We have certain areas of our plant that we aren't allowed to wear fall protection because of moving/rotating machinery or other hazards. I wonder if this is one of those places.
OSHA,3dbebs,Captain_Nipples,3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate a little? There has to he something out there designed to work within those constraints, but maybe not!"
OSHA,3dbebs,lFrylock,7,Wed Jul 15 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"Normally, we have time to build a scaffold that protects workers lanyards from being exposed to getting snagged in a rotating shaft..  Above our mini-turbine, which sits below a 500 MW turbine, there are a lot of instrument lines coming off the high and low pressure steam lines. If those instruments fail, there's a risk of the plant automatically tripping.. This loses millions of dollars (much less than they'd have to pay my family if I died. At least that's how I see it)  Anyways.. In ideal situations, we build a scaffold and can access these with no worries.. But when there's an emergency situation, they'll make an exception to the tie off rule (because of the rotating equipment or the need to get the fuck out of there quickly.. Especially in the event of an overspin which is really fucking scary)  Also.. I forgot to add that it's around 130 degrees in this room or more during the summer months.. So, if you pass out and fall into it with your lanyard exposed to the shaft, you're absolutely going to be torn to shreds.  Edit.. Kind of how you're not allowed to work on a lathe with gloves on. Except this machine is much larger and spins 100 times faster.  We're also competent scaffold builders. OSHA says that we're not required to tie off in situations that can create more of a hazard. I'd rather just get up there and do the work in a few minutes instead of spending hours in a dangerous situation building a scaffold."
OSHA,3dbebs,Captain_Nipples,5,Wed Jul 15 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"Goddamn thanks! That sounds ultra terrifying but sensical too. My employer tried to make gloves mandatory building-wide, and when I work in the machine shop, no fucking way am I wearing gloves of any sort running a lathe or mill. The scaffolding makes sense, pretty smart. As long as you send the smart ones up to fix it when shit gets haywire and you keep your mind on task, things are often alright.  Appreciate the explanation!"
OSHA,3dbebs,lFrylock,5,Thu Jul 16 00:22:46 2015 UTC,"Never permit operators to wear loose clothing, long hair, jewelry, or gloves.   From OSHA..   https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/woodworking/production_lathes.html  There's so much of a snagging potential.. What's fucked up for me is our company is now requiring us to wear name badges outside of our clothing because ""Terrorists""  Fucking crazy."
OSHA,3dbebs,Captain_Nipples,5,Thu Jul 16 00:33:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm very aware. I'm in Canada but John deere is an American company, we told both divisions to fuck their hats and that if they wanted people to wear gloves while machining, it would cost em $1000+++ an hour worth of hazard pay, nooo thanks. They try and enact policies without understanding the legalities, and then write policy loopholes to circumvent the law.   Edit: terrorism is scary  I work with 230+ people and can name every single one, no nametags and shit needed"
OSHA,3dbebs,lFrylock,4,Thu Jul 16 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, we have a $400,000,000 project going on right now and there are around 200-400 extra workers there with no badges.  Doesn't make sense to make the people that you know wear badges, unless you just want a reason to be able to snitch on the ones you do know..  Also, our security does nothing, but harrass people that have their badges. Meanwhile... There are guys (Union Construction Workers) pulling guns on each other in the parking lot, because Security is too fucking lazy to actually roam around. I've been there 6 years and some of my coworkers have been there for over 30 and we still get fucked with like we're visitors by guys that are making $9.00/hr who've only been there about 6 months.  Sorry.. I'm venting"
OSHA,3dbebs,Captain_Nipples,3,Thu Jul 16 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"What the deuce do you do that all this is going on? The union workers bit doesn't surprise me, i've seen my fair share of fucking crazy union ironworkers pulling some psychotic shit"

OSHA,3d54g9,CantaloupeCamper,16,Mon Jul 13 18:50:58 2015 UTC,Those straps are surprisingly strong for what they look like.   I'd say it would be fine. Plus it looks like there is additional strapping at the front of the machine.
OSHA,3d54g9,leviwhite9,17,Mon Jul 13 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Those straps aren't meant for machinery like that, you're supposed to use chains.  I think those straps are rated for 15k ? I'd have to check when I go into work tonight."
OSHA,3d54g9,adventure_dog,6,Mon Jul 13 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"If imagine for hauling it would be okay, wouldn't it?  I wouldn't think they would need to be rated for the weight of the vehicle. You just need to keep it from shifting around.   But hell, maybe I don't know. I'm not a trucker."
OSHA,3d54g9,leviwhite9,5,Mon Jul 13 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"When I did my licence (not USA but a western country), the law was the system must take 1G of forward deceleration, 0.5G sideways and rearward, and 0.2G vertical. G=Acceleration due to gravity, so equal to the weight force of the machine. I imagine it is fairly similar in the States, and at my place of work we never use rachets for machines (only for poles, wood, wheelbarrows, compactors etc.). All vehicles are chained down."
OSHA,3d54g9,demetrius_savelio,2,Tue Jul 14 07:41:43 2015 UTC,When it comes to machinery on wheels/tracks chains and load binders are the safer and better equipment 99% of the time.
OSHA,3d54g9,ILitYourBabyOnFire,2,Tue Jul 14 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"If the equipment weights 60,000 pounds it has hook points for being hauled safely with the proper hooks and chains.  If you're going to use straps that are made out of cloth and other materials that have a weight rating of 15,000 pounds. They're not made for the hook points on the equipment, the shifting around could cut the straps or cause them to snap and break.  It's not safe and could get the vehicle operator lots of fun tickets their boss may not pay."
OSHA,3d54g9,adventure_dog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"We use these models of diggers at work and we hold them onto our trailers using three ratchet straps, one round the front, one round the back and one holding the arm/bucket. And it's all to spec as far as safety goes."
OSHA,3d54g9,WildTurkey81,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:10 2015 UTC,Safe? If you say so.  Legal? Absolutely not.

I work for a very large company which is part of an international conglomeration, and we have regular depot inspections and our company takes health and safety really seriously. The ratchet straps are totally legal. I'm from the UK, if that makes a difference."
OSHA,3d54g9,WildTurkey81,6,Tue Jul 14 18:35:16 2015 UTC,We have some rigging straps that can hold over 38k lbs. Nylon and polyster are heavy duty stuff

OSHA,3d54g9,fujirio,4,Mon Jul 13 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, that will lower the cab so the driver can get in. But it's not going to help the driver get anywhere, as soon as the operator moves the bucket back to the forward position the truck will tilt again.   The reason the bucket is facing forwards in the first place is to help displace the weight towards the front to keep the truck level.   Operators use their bucket for balance all the time."
OSHA,3d54g9,CupformyCosta,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"If he gets it level again, he could try to back up to a ditch or other make-shift loading dock. Or even place supports under the frame with a ramp. Endless possibilities."
OSHA,3d54g9,InterloperKO,3,Mon Jul 13 21:46:02 2015 UTC,The whole cab rotates. The bucket could be resting on the back and the majority of weight ahead of the rear wheels.
OSHA,3d54g9,ITSigno,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"The whole cab rotates.    I know, I'm around/on an excavator 5 days a week.    The bucket could be resting on the back and the majority of weight ahead of the rear wheels.    Yeah, that would help tilt the truck forwards because the engine/counterweight would be towards the front of the truck but it doesn't look like there's enough room to fit the boom/stick on the back of the truck. You can't just let the stick hang off the back of the truck while driving, I'm pretty sure that's illegal. That truck just isn't big enough to haul that excavator."
OSHA,3d54g9,CupformyCosta,3,Tue Jul 14 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"The machine can move forward more, but he would have to completely unload, it looks like his blade is forward. Put the machine as far forward as possible and the boom facing backwards, it's legal to do as long as it's flagged."
OSHA,3d54g9,4boltmain,10,Tue Jul 14 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"Should have backed it on the truck this would have put the weight in front of the truck's rear axle.   Also,  why is his hood open?"

OSHA,3d2pdz,bedhed,8,Mon Jul 13 04:02:50 2015 UTC,"Portable scaffolding is really useful, when used correctly obviously."
OSHA,3d2pdz,Mitch_is_pretty_cool,5,Mon Jul 13 12:04:33 2015 UTC,"You're speculating the roof is sloped. I doubt it is. (Ie, low slope. Most roofs have some degree of slope either toward a drain or gutter system.) Even then, if the casters were locked, no problem. Much of the scaffolding out there has locking wheels/casters and are OSHA approved."
OSHA,3d2pdz,PIE-314,16,Mon Jul 13 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"All roofs are sloped some. It just depends on whether it is to a drain or to gutters. Otherwise the water would puddle causing huge leakage problems.   You can see on the picture that there is a gutter system on the edge, which tells me it is sloped toward the gutter. It doesn't have to be a big slope to cause something to roll."
OSHA,3d2pdz,Dysalot,-4,Mon Jul 13 10:33:15 2015 UTC,"All roofs are sloped some.   Not really true.  Many coal tar roofs are installed dead level.  Some new roofs are too, like TPO's and EPDM's."
OSHA,3d2pdz,theraf8100,12,Mon Jul 13 11:34:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true, if a roof is installed flat, it is wrong. The systems you mention are called low-slope.   The EPDM (ethylene propylene diene terpolymer) single-ply rubber roofing membrane has been an appealing choice of the low-slope commercial roofing industry for over 40 years.   https://www.gaf.com/Roofing/Commercial/Guide_To_Low_Slope_Roofing_Systems"
OSHA,3d2pdz,BaggedTaco,0,Mon Jul 13 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"Well that's nice and all, but I've had GAF warranty roofs that are installed dead level.  It's always recommended to have a slope, but there are plenty of warrantied roofs out there that are dead level."
OSHA,3d2pdz,theraf8100,6,Mon Jul 13 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"I use this phrase often, Just because you've always done it that way doesn't make it right."
OSHA,3d2pdz,BaggedTaco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was always done this way.  I said there are exceptions.  I also said it wasn't recommended.  And you also omitted my main point, coal tar roofs, which is perfectly acceptable to be installed level."
OSHA,3d2pdz,theraf8100,5,Mon Jul 13 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"But really, they are not. No roof should be completely level, in fact there is no way anyone is installing a roof completely level. They will have standing water on them, which will deteriorate the roofing material faster, and it's not right.  Do people do it? Yes. Will it leak immediately? No. Will it void the warranty? Perhaps not. Is it the right way? Absolutely not."
OSHA,3d2pdz,BaggedTaco,2,Mon Jul 13 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but if you think it's not right to install a coal tar roof dead level, then you don't know about coal tar roofing."
OSHA,3d2pdz,theraf8100,2,Mon Jul 13 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"Even those roofs have some slope to them to lead to the drains. They appear flat, but are not perfectly flat. Hopefully ASHI counts as a reasonable source.  I'm not saying it never happens, but it shouldn't happen.   Checking IBC The minimum roof slope is 1/4"" per 12"" for bitumen or thermoplastic roofing installations.  PDF of IBC Section"
OSHA,3d2pdz,Dysalot,4,Mon Jul 13 12:41:04 2015 UTC,"There is a gutter at the bottom, it is sloped.   Flat roofs don't have gutters.  And obviously the wheels weren't locked since it rolled off the roof lol."

B)aside from calling the electrical company, how would one get this down? ((i see hitting it with a stick has already been suggested))  EDIT: After a quick trip to youtube and this graphic video (warning), i'll just let someone else with proper training handle the problem"
OSHA,3d2pdz,inucune,21,Mon Jul 13 09:24:52 2015 UTC,"You can check if it has voltage with a non-contact voltage detector, which can detect the presence of AC voltage without ever touching it.   However, there is a nonzero chance that you electrocute yourself and die due to step potential while walking towards it.   The real solution is to stand the fuck back, and tell everyone else to do the same. Get the power company to deal with it. If it's in a busy area, call 911 so the police will rope it off.

OSHA,3d2pdz,Dirty_Socks,10,Mon Jul 13 09:38:30 2015 UTC,"It appears to just be hanging off the guy wire, so no voltage. You can see the in line insulator, and it looks like the primary and neutral are even further up. Source: guy who works around power lines every day."

OSHA,3d2pdz,JohnProof,2,Mon Jul 13 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"It looks like the right corner of the scaffolding is on the guy wire. If it was on a primary or neutral, you'd see it bowing because they have some slack. Guy wire is tight."

OSHA,3d2pdz,bem13,6,Mon Jul 13 13:49:12 2015 UTC,The same thing happened in the video happened in my country about a week ago. Workers were moving a scaffolding and hit a 20kV wire with it. All of them died...
OSHA,3d2pdz,PIE-314,3,Mon Jul 13 10:45:10 2015 UTC,There's another longer version of that video. It's like 10 mins long. About half way through one of them actually gets up and walks away only to stumble back onto the scaffold.
OSHA,3d2pdz,lynxSnowCat,5,Mon Jul 13 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"17:28 in the source video?  I missed him because I wasn't paying attention, and started watching the other fallen ""painters""(?) to see which of them were still alive. Only on the second viewing of the video (where I did not look away did I notice him.)  NSFL:  17:29  survivor gets up again and sprints off frame. At about the same time the other man who fell at that corner starts to move, but unfortunately draws his right leg rigidly sweeps into the post w/out the other man blocking it. That man's head continues to move. I hoped that this was convuslions from the current ebbing, but -- 17:31  That man's body is catching fire, and amplitude and visibility of his movements increase. 17:34  left Arm fully enveloped in flames, man finally suceeds in inching his shoulder away from post, but remains trapped by current holding his body inplace. By throwing his head (only part not part of current path?) around man seems to be very slowly pulling his shoulders away from his hyper extended burning arm (tearing it off?) and his legs seem to be very slowly sliding off of the post. legs kick back onto post after exposing momentairly flashes of what could be electricity or fire. 17:35  man's right foot slides off of post. no flash, but sudden change in posture as upper body is drawn in. Suggests a new current path. Man remains still until end of QQ recording."

OSHA,3d2pdz,Magnuts,7,Mon Jul 13 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"I've always kinda felt like it's kind of a /r/osha idea to put power lines dangling from poles all over the fucking place anyways.  If we can run  water and sewer to every house under ground, why wouldn't we do the same with power?  Who thought it was a good idea to just string these high voltage wires up everywhere?"
OSHA,3d2pdz,ShadyBiz,13,Mon Jul 13 09:34:34 2015 UTC,"It is much cheaper to run them above ground and easier to maintain them without digging them up.  That said, In my city, all power cables are below ground and most suburbs are too."
OSHA,3d2pdz,Magnuts,5,Mon Jul 13 10:13:04 2015 UTC,"I could see cheaper to put up.  But I'd say in the long run they would be cheaper and easier to maintain.    As they currently are, things fall and land on power lines frequently.  I'm sure for any given county, they lose power in some area at least once a week due to a fallen tree branch or a driver who has hit a telephone poll.  Buried utility lines would only be at risk if someone dug through them.  Which I would say is going to be a much more unlikely occurrence."
OSHA,3d2pdz,ShadyBiz,14,Mon Jul 13 10:27:05 2015 UTC,"""Such an undertaking would cost approximately $41 billion, nearly six times the net book value of the utilities' current distribution assets, and would require approximately 25 years to complete,"" the report states. Customers' rates would have to more than double to pay for the project, the commission' staff found.   That's for North Carolina, from a quick googling.   And underground lines ""are not without their disadvantages,"" they concluded. While more reliable ""under normal weather conditions,"" they take almost 60% longer to fix when something does happen to them.   That doesn't seem like much, but can make the difference between a couple of hours and all night without power.   ""Buried power lines are protected from the wind, ice and tree damage that are common causes of outages, and so suffer fewer weather or vegetation-related outages,"" it concluded. ""But buried lines are more vulnerable to flooding, and can still fail due to equipment issues or lightning.""   We certainly have had issues in Australia where flooding has done serious damage to our power grids. I know our telephone infrastructure suffers because of it but that is a separate issue.  http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/12/us/winter-storm-power-lines/  Basically it comes down to a really expensive rollout and not enough ""pros"" to justify it.   I reckon above ground lines are hideous eyesores though."
OSHA,3d2pdz,Magnuts,4,Mon Jul 13 10:46:42 2015 UTC,Damn Shadybiz!  That's some quality info.  Didn't expect that.  I was just kinda making assumptions and here you go looking up facts.  Good job.
OSHA,3d2pdz,theDeadliestSnatch,6,Mon Jul 13 10:56:59 2015 UTC,"When something does go wrong with an underground line, it's a lot harder to find the fault fix it. If it's dead, linemen can splice and rehang bare overhead wires in a few minutes."

Luckily, plugs are generally compatible with both styles).  And there are international standards. IEC 60309 is absolutely the norm for 400V three-phase outlets and single-phase outdoor 240V.  There's also IEC 60906-1 for indoor 240V. It just doesn't make sense to introduce when you already have a sane system, though: The only advantage over Schuko (if mated with Schuko, not some old soviet taser plugs) is its size.

You work on radars, and essentially turn them off and on until it works again. 2. The ones I have mad respect for, the comms ET who works on satellite communications equipment and line of sight gear. These guys actually have some brains. 3rd option you're a 2M guy or a solder jockey saving your tax payers millions of dollars fixing circuit cards that can cost up to a million $$$ a piece.

I've been out for a couple years now and am working in my masters in electrical engineering and when one of my old navy buddies says he's a nuclear engineer, out of respect for my own profession I have to shut him down for thinking that a year of training in the Navy is somehow equivalent to the six years of college I've had to suffer through to get these degrees."

I'm a robot integrator and I have to do risk assessments and safety audits of our systems as part of my job. They keep a few of these buttons as overstock because I usually make them add one or two. You should never have to take more than a step or two from a normal work position to hit one of these. If they're being pressed on accident, you need to look at your workflow and whether or not there's enough room for operator movement in the work area. People complain about issues like this to me but then I go out and assess it and there's like only 18"" of space for some poor operator to squeeze by it, and that's not my fault. That's on their damn plant manager trying to maximize floor space by taping off a god damn skid parking spot right next to the door to the cell.  Placement height is sometimes a culprit too. If they're too low, they can get hip checked sometimes. But that happens because the button isn't in line of sight, and people don't see it.

This is a training issue, not a 'there are too many safety devices on my machine!' issue.  If you're having to hit the e-stop 3 times in a shift, you have at least one of:   People in unsafe places. Poor reliability and operation of the machinery affected. Poor training as to what an EMERGENCY STOP button does vs what a 'cycle stop' or 'power off' button.    Looking at this, the worker basically put a box over the button to prevent accidental switching, as you could presumably remove the zip tie quite easily to push the button in a real situation.    As unlikely as it seems in a hypothetical situation, the extra couple tenths of a second to remove that ziptie could be the difference between a close call and a lost limb or life.  Especially when shit goes wrong, people tend to freak.   Management should of course reprimand the worker, but also install a legit button cover that makes everyone's world a bit easier.

By definition they are an uncontrolled stop, and though the machine may be at rest, you're usually dropping power to motor drives and PLC outputs and everything else.  Will it damage the machine? Probably not, but a shutdown button and sequence were made for a reason. Of course it varies widely with the machine, process, current state, and other circumstances such that blanket statements can't be universally applied.

OSHA,3co58m,amaefm,20,Thu Jul 9 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"Worked on fracking crew once upon a time.  Normal operations has high-pressure pumps running 5000 gallons per minute with 4 pounds of sand per gallon.    The e-stop on one of these cuts the fuel to the engine so it almost immediately stops moving.  Including the 4lbs of sand per gallon in the lines.  All that sand settles, and it'll be a week in the shop before that pump ever sees use.    Now, it's time for a funny story.  Imagine that line in the picture tied into a global shutdown system.  The IT guy was having problems keeping the internet up in the command van, and had to unplug something 'just for a second'.  The ""null"" signal was heard by the global shutdown system, which immediately killed twice as many of those pumps.    That crew averages $2mil/day in revenue, and instead spent the week scrubbing sand & chemicals out of their pumps."
OSHA,3co58m,nmgoh2,10,Thu Jul 9 17:32:45 2015 UTC,Was it guy fired? I'm assuming he was.
OSHA,3co58m,Hidesuru,28,Thu Jul 9 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"He actually wasn't, as the work he was doing was normal maintainance of an offline system, and shouldn't have affected anything.  But, the global safety system was new, and apparently didn't spend much time in bug testing.    Sure he could've picked a better time to do the work, and now we have a general ""don't fix anything unless it's broken"" rule during operations, but at the time he was just trying to be productive while on the clock.    Bosses at that company were some of the best I've ever worked for."
OSHA,3co58m,nmgoh2,12,Thu Jul 9 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misinterpreted your story to mean he was doing something wrong somehow. In that case yeah, great bosses. I can't imagine the feeling in his stomach when he unplugged the cable and heard everything stop, though, lmao. Poor guy."
OSHA,3co58m,Hidesuru,16,Thu Jul 9 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Oh he immediately knew he fucked up when 50 commercial-truck sized diesel engines running at full throttle went silent as soon as he pulled the cord.    I forgot the end of the story: The bosses actually uninstalled the global shutdown system, and went back to the 'each operator shuts their equipment down' system, as going from max rate to zero rate in a second sends a shockwave through the already-pressure-strained lines that could cause an even worse safety issue than what caused the global shutdown."
OSHA,3co58m,nmgoh2,12,Thu Jul 9 17:58:50 2015 UTC,More importantly why is the IT guy's system linked to the e-stop signal?

E-Stop conditions are designed to immediately remove the threat of the powered equipment. They're not designed to avoid damage to equipment or the parts being processed, because in an emergency the ultimate concern is human safety and not some dumb machine. It can cause unnecessary wear and tear. This is why we design all our systems with clean stops (both immediate hold and end of cycle stop) and train people to use them instead of the big red button.

Even when that machine isn't designed to forcibly and immediately stop.   That means if a pump is running at 5000gpm and is full of fluids and sand, that the e-stop will suddenly and immeidately shut it down, requiring the machinery to be re-built at a price of $10-20k IF you have staff around that can do the repair.  If you're calling a tech, you can double the price.    This is no big deal if it's for a legitimate safety issue, but if you accidentally hit it, it's just a straight 5-figure loss.  Keep doing it, and you get no production and are constantly fixing it because the operator keeps accidentally hitting it.  Standard reaction by management is to fire the guy who accidentally hit the button, even if it was a pure accident, ""because he should have been more careful"".    If I'm staring down a pink slip due to bad design decisions on the equipment manufacturer's part, you can bet I'll take actions to not get fired if I can't get someone at the company to move the button."

No operator should have to resort to a dangerous jury rig like this. You should be able to point out the issue and get it taken care of properly but that's not what is happening here.
OSHA,3co58m,ffryd,7,Thu Jul 9 19:16:15 2015 UTC,You missed the comment earlier where a guy who claimed to design E Stop buttons said there was no such thing as covers or collars.
OSHA,3co58m,death_by_chocolate,11,Thu Jul 9 13:56:11 2015 UTC,Lol. I hope he's not writing the lockout/tagout procedures.
OSHA,3co58m,flatcurve,7,Thu Jul 9 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"That's not how LOTO is supposed to work, unless all the e-stops on your machines remove high voltage from the panel."
OSHA,3co58m,flatcurve,4,Thu Jul 9 15:36:00 2015 UTC,Stop covers often come with a hasp designed into them for LOTO compliance where applicable.
OSHA,3co58m,flatcurve,5,Fri Jul 10 04:37:42 2015 UTC,"Well they're not supposed to be guarded. That's not to say you can't get a red mushroom button that has a collar or cover on it... but it won't be labelled as an E-Stop.  That's also not to say you can't specifically get an E-Stop with a collar on it. You can, but it will only be a partial collar. You definitely can't get an e-stop button with a cover of any kind.  The thing about regulations is that it's up to the person building the machine to interpret them. There are some E-Stop buttons for sale out there that I don't think pass current ISO and ANSI standards, so I don't use them. Doesn't mean somebody else can't interpret those standards differently."

If that's the case then this is actually a reasonable/passable solution (for an operator repair). Of course, operators aren't usually supposed to repair things, nor are they supposed to need to, but that's usually not the operator's call."
OSHA,3co58m,I_AM_OSHA,6,Thu Jul 9 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The question that never gets asked (it seems) is 'how did this come to be?' If there was an effective and responsive channel in place to address the need for rigs like this--and one cannot argue that there isn't a need because there's a damn picture of it--then it would never have become necessary. You should be able to point out a bad location or a poorly placed stop, be confident about not being ignored or putting your job in jeopardy, and get it rectified without delay. But when there is no channel or procedure and maintenance or management are non-responsive (and why is this, pray tell?)  you get left to your own devices. And here we are."
OSHA,3co58m,thelordofcheese,2,Thu Jul 9 22:38:02 2015 UTC,Any shop should instruct an operator not to work if the environment is unsafe. Any shop is also likely to walk you out the door on the spot if you bypass safety equipment for any reason.
OSHA,3co58m,chalky1962,3,Thu Jul 9 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"I know shops like that exist, but they aren't the only kind. This whole forum kind of exists as a testament to the fact that, no not all shops have a strict focus on safety and correctness."
OSHA,3co58m,colfaxmingo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I was sorta assuming a bare minimum somewhere. Using a knife without a cut glove is dangerous, but depending on context some shops may tolerate it. If your suggestion of ""not the operator's call"" is the case, that is some shit super. Good way to get shit-canned too. If something goes wrong it will fall on you - not the supervisor.  Unrelated: Shame there wasn't room for the fifth 'fnord'"

This is for heavy duty plastic buckets around 50 pounds per. So bottom bucket supports up to 250 pounds at base (i.e. bottom of lowest bucket).  Those are paint buckets. Last paint bucket I lifted was approximately heavy as fuck so we'll just assume 250 pound is the ""safe limit""."

OSHA,3cif1o,A-F-C,5,Thu Jul 9 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"because they don't know what that breaker is doing. Yeah, it's 20A, but what's plugged in to it in the house? Was the original wiring installed correctly? If OP is unlucky and those wires are near the max load and the incorrect ones were installed then the extra draw through there could damage the equipment plugged in there, melt the breaker, and possibly heat those wires to the melting point starting an electrical fire. Even if the box was labeled, the labels could be wrong, what they thought was the kitchen line could be the line to the room with great grandad's life support system.  Point is, if they wanted power, they needed to talk to OP first and find out if there were any special problems or equipment in the house."

OSHA,3cif1o,thelordofcheese,31,Fri Jul 17 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"It looks like they put the hot wire in a breaker that is already being occupied by another circuit. If they didn't switch off the breaker and the wire for the existing circuit was loose enough, I could see electronics on that circuit being damaged.  OP I very strongly suggest contacting a city official. I would start with your city's building department (may be called inspection department, city code enforcement, etc. depending on what your city decided to call it). This most definitely does not meet code and I'm pretty sure that for any contractor to add something to an electrical panel, they need a permit. Take pictures of everything. This one, the entire length of extension cable, and the cherry on top: a picture of them using that extension cable.  One of the reasons electricians are licensed is because what they are working with has safety hazards not just for them, but for the occupants of the business, home, etc. One such hazard is fire. If there is a poor connection it poses a fire hazard, and it only gets worse as time goes on."

BUT They didn't remove the cover, you can see it in the photo, on edge. The top gray metal bar with a little upset in the middle... these boxes are designed so you can prop the lid open. IF the hot lines into the breaker are both right and secure, There's not a huge fire danger... that's why we HAVE breakers in the first place... so at least they did that part right.    After you call the police and the city to file appropriate reports (you have pictures...) I would close the panel and put a small lock on it. And a note, with your phone number, telling that if someone wants access they need to call you - chances are the idiot who did this will call you, and you can find out who it was, and ream them out. On the up side... the MOST they can pull through that circuit is about 43kWh per day (1800w * 24), which at $0.12 (average) is about $5, so you dodn't need to worry about having a huge power bill at least. I would advise you NOT do anything to sabotage their power line by hooking the neutral to the other side of the panel... last thing you need is to damage an expensive tool or get someone killed because you felt slighted by an idiot."
OSHA,3cif1o,GreySoulx,4,Wed Jul 8 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, If they're willing to dismantle someone's box to steal power, I think they'll be fine breaking the lock with bold cutters to open it back up.

In which case, the only signs that it's time to retire this rope that you could see from looking (that I remember) are if the kern fibers are exposed, or if the mantle is so frayed it won't run cleanly through the hardware, neither of which looks to be the case here (yet).  Of course they should also be feeling the entire length of the rope periodically for soft spots, slippage, or all the other problems that you can only detect that way; and automatically retiring it after a certain number of years."

Each employe shall furnish to each of its employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to its employees.   Edit: also OSHA references the MUTCD therefore it is also an enforceable standard.   Edit 2. Forgot the obvious confined space entry violations as well.
OSHA,3cepya,XBLGERMEX,4,Tue Jul 7 14:29:55 2015 UTC,Won't be confined space unless entire body can fit in hole.  FYI I am an inspector
OSHA,3cepya,Philanthropiss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"If it is a confined space you're not supposed to let any part of your body enter. But I think you can partially block the entrance with a bar or something and then safely ""break the plane"" of the confined space."
OSHA,3cepya,buckydean,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"This often causes confusion because of the definition of entry in 1910.146 but OSHA specifically addressed this in their 1993 final rule for general industry and its also in the 2015 final rule for construction.   The final rule states that the Agency has not adopted this suggestion. While OSHA is concerned that spaces that are too small for complete bodily entry may pose hazards for employees, the Agency did not intend to cover such spaces under the permit space standard. OSHA believes that the NPRM preamble discussion of permit space incidents and of proposed provisions clearly indicates that the proposed rule was intended to cover only spaces that were large enough for the entire body of an employee to enter. As commenters have correctly noted, the proposed definition of “permit required confined space” did not cover the “small” spaces. Such spaces do not meet the definition of “confined space,” nor do they pose hazards comparable to those associated with confined spaces. Since an employee cannot totally enter such spaces, he or she should not have difficulty withdrawing from the space. In order for a space to be considered a permit-required confined space, it must first be a confined space. A space that cannot be entered is not confined; therefore, it does not pose hazards related to the difficulty of exiting the space.  So yes you can break the plane with any part of your body as long as you can easily exit.  So the picture in this thread would not be needed to be treated as a confined space and especially not a permit required confined space unless he got completely in there and there was hydrogen sulfide gas or other sewer gases.

This part of the industry is much more lax on safety standards, but things are finally catching up after the collapse in Indiana and Canada and other locations.   I myself have free climbed these structures when I was younger. Yes it is easier without a harness, and it can tangle you up with all of the cable and light fixtures, but it still is a sure fire way to save your ass.  This is a smaller stage. Likely a regional company employing non union hands, and very likely no site specific engineering for the weight of build, and no high wind action plan.  Entertainment has never gone by OSHA in the past, but it's starting to catch up. I've never seen hard hats on a job site until recently. Never seen people in harness on a scissor or boom lift. Hell we used to use a 16' a frame ladder with a 10' extension in the middle for focusing lights. That was a common theatre practice.  Hopefully this industry catches up on safety standards.

No harness. Then she had some stagehands push the lift along the row of lights while it was raised, to get them all in one swipe.  A couple minutes later, tink crash as a lens fell on to the stage, glass shards everywhere. It's funny, as a local stagehand, how much variation I saw from show to show. Some had me admiring their professionalism, others had me standing far away from anything heavy or sharp unless necessary."
OSHA,3c6b11,Jsegbers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"I worked as a stage hand for a few years in Indiana, they definitely don't do much with safety.  I worked in an indoor theatre so it was even worse in there, after the incident in Indianapolis they started requiring a certification for operating the man-life, but only when outside which we never were.  Regardless, we didn't have a harness that could be used with it and regularly used them without outriggers and moved the man lifts when someone was up in one.    We also did all the work on the lighting bridges (except for when someone had to hang off for the underhung lights) without a harness, there wasn't a railing at the end of those bridges either.  I personally hung out of a man lift past my waste many times as did many others.  My boss jumped from one once (trying to grab onto a giant x-mas tree section and make it slide into place) and fell to the ground.  I can't believe the stupid stuff we did with a man lift and without any real accident.  On the other hand, we stored stuff in an external warehouse and had to follow their rules when inside.  That meant one of their guys drove the forklift, and we used proper safety equipment when working on the second and third levels on the shelving units."

Here's a list of encounters my family has had with flying things in the freeways in California during the past year:   Nuts and bolts (mixed with other stuff I don't know) come pouring out of a truck's bed. My cousin has no choice but to drive over them. Blows both of her front tires, but fortunately she doesn't hit anything else (Haven't figured out how she didn't lose control).  Ladder comes flying out of a truck. Trailer drives over and kicks it on to the next lane. My dad (driving a shitty Hyundai) sees ladder hitting him. Swerves around, missing it with a few feet. One of out other relatives sees couch falling out of a trailer, quickly thinking, he changes the lane. The couch falls out but doesn't hit anyone.

Quick combat roll and I made a dash to the garage to get my dads telescoping fiberglass pole. Bye bye birdies...

OSHA,3bszk2,OffalAutopsy,20,Wed Jul 1 22:11:31 2015 UTC,Worst part is this happened at a fork lift repair company.

OSHA,3bszk2,Greydusk1324,3,Thu Jul 2 05:05:35 2015 UTC,Yes it is. Typically they are a up to a couple tons( this one would be smaller) as they help provide the counterweight the lift needs.
OSHA,3bszk2,Orange_Lemon,2,Thu Jul 2 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"yep, the larger ones we have at our warehouse are 2700 lbs."
OSHA,3bszk2,subhazardorange,3,Thu Jul 2 10:45:48 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Weight stamped on battery of counter lift is over 2500 for regular counter balance. Total weight of equipment without any weight on it is 9700 +/- 100 lbs. weight capacity is generally around 4000 lbs. most I go up to when I the air is 3500 depending on if it has a squeeze attachment on the lift.
OSHA,3bszk2,Greydusk1324,2,Thu Jul 2 18:23:12 2015 UTC,Once righted and cleaned it just needs to be checked for shorts and specific gravity adjusted. Any damaged cells could be changed easily.

OSHA,3bn4vh,CoolGuy54,21,Tue Jun 30 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"*quite possibly more, the engine could be going through a reduction gearbox at something like 3.5:1 (so the engine makes 3.5 revolutions for every 1 revolution of this output shaft leading to the propeller).  That in turn increases the torque by a factor of 3.5, so (not allowing for mechanical losses of ~3%) we get 26,613,475 Nm.   Of course it might be a direct drive two-stroke engine where the crankshaft is directly connected to the propeller with no gearbox; the largest ship engines run at very, very low speed. (Kinda like the video). But really it all depends on the ship in question.  Source: undergraduate naval architecture student"
OSHA,3bn4vh,Ivebeenfurthereven,9,Tue Jun 30 21:04:35 2015 UTC,Why are two stroke engines used instead of four stroke engines? Aren't four stroke engines more efficient?  Sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm just a layman when it comes to gas engines.
OSHA,3bn4vh,Dirty_Socks,6,Wed Jul 1 02:00:56 2015 UTC,A two-stroke that massive sounds crazy!
OSHA,3bn4vh,Lewintheparkwithagun,12,Wed Jul 1 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"It's true!  Essentially, small marine engines are based on a block design from the automotive or construction industry. Larger ones are based on engines from trucks. Larger still (up to ~1MW, ~1200HP) are from the rail industry - diesel locomotives.  Beyond that, the engines start to look very different, as you can see in my link, particularly the cross-section. They have an ultra-long stroke for maximum efficiency during the burn process at very slow speed - as low as 60-120RPM. It's also not really ""diesel"" they burn - it's ultra-thick, cheap tar, that has to be heated before it's runny enough to pump. The reason is that it's far cheaper than diesel, and waste heat from the exhaust can be freely recovered in a ship engine room this large anyway.  The reason for using a two-stroke is simple: Power density. More specifically, light weight. Because it fires twice as often, the engine is one half of the weight it would have to be to produce this much power in a four-stroke design. In other words, a massive saving at this scale.

OSHA,3bn4vh,Dirty_Socks,6,Wed Jul 1 08:12:18 2015 UTC,That shaft is rotating about 11 rpm and not even the largest slow speed engines go that slow. I don't think It is not driven by any engine in this picture because propellers in sailing speed don't go this slow either  Lets say that is a 400mm hollow intermediate shaft of a streight coupled shaft line. A fitting main engine might be MAN's six cylinder G45ME if ship's DWT is around 45000. This engine produce 5838kW at 98.6rpm which translate to 565kNm. All if that engine was running though.  Because that shaft is free-spinning because of the current(?) that torque doesn't apply. Shaft that big might have a 6 meter fixed pitch propeller with 4 blades. Such a propeller has a moment of inertia about 21207 kgm2 in that 99rpm (in one case). Someone else can calculate from here.  Source: I design stuff like this for living

The fire department said they would have to evacuate. The call center manager thinks every single cent matters and said ""NO"".  Fire Marshal made a phone call and 10 minutes later the power company cut power to the building.   Police showed up and informed the managers they and their staff need to leave or will be arrested.  A fire marshal is god. Someone sees this picture it is an immediate fix, not ""we will come check it next week"". Its a we will watch you fix itright now"

Remember that a box on the bottom layer of a pallet of wine is supporting 100-200 lbs above it (~40lbs per case of wine, 6 layers high) so they can support an average sized person in theory.  but not when the top of the case is removed and you're standing on the loose bottles.

OSHA,3blpvg,_Mithi_,2,Tue Jun 30 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"How many Starfleet officers get killed when their station blows up?  Have these guys lost surge protection or opto-isolation circuits in the 24th century?  This is a solved problem!  How often has one part of the ship lost communication with another during a crisis?  Naval vessels today have redundant lines of communication--usually sound powered telephones, but potentially also including handheld radios and battery powered intercoms as well.  Yet somehow when main power goes down on the Enterprise, the bridge has to send runners to engineering.  How often have the turbolifts (star trek elevators) fallen?  First, the ship has to generate gravity, so why there's gravity at all in the turboshaft is a mystery.  But even if it is there for some engineering reason, elevators today don't fall.  Mechanical safety systems are nearly 100% successful at preventing elevators from plummeting if a cable breaks or other problem.    Speaking of falls, engineers falling from the second floor of the warp core is a regular occurrence in TNG and orginal trek.  Geordi once says he got dizzy and nearly fell (if an ensign had not caught him, he says he would have fallen).  Fall protection people?  It is not exactly rocket science.  If they want to use force fields and repulsor beams, fine.  But a cable and tie would work just fine.  The point is that these are unnecessary deaths.  And the list goes on.  Over and over, Starfleet safety engineering sucks."

Place looked like a kitchen, you didn't mention what kind of knife so I made an assumption based on the environment.  There's more than just pocket knives at a Family Dollar depending where you go.  Don't assume people think the same as you do or carry the same equipment.   The only tool here is you.   Oh grow up."
OSHA,3bfc93,NeedsMoreTests,-6,Sun Jun 28 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"if you just cut the cable the company will still have to pay to have it replaced and installed elsewhere instead of just getting it moved   That's kind of the point. See? I knew you knew what I was getting at. But wait, there's more. See, if you make them get a new cable (ooooh, a whopping $20), they'll go ""Maybe we ought not do shit like that again."" They'll learn a lesson, you'll be safer. It's a win-win. Trust me, after you work for managers that don't care just once, you'll realize that the stupidity isn't stupidity. It's not caring followed by ""I don't wanna spend money to do it right and safe, fuck my employees."" All that instead of doing it right the first time... they'll have to pay to have it ""moved"" right? Yeah, they'll need to run it through the ceiling and if it's near lights, it'll need to be shielded cable. This is just plainly not caring about employees to save another 20-ish bucks.   so I made an assumption    You sure did. Here's a hint, son: jumping to conclusions ain't exercise. Here's another hint: ethernet is run with AWG 24 wire and there's 8 of them in UTP. A kitchen knife (steel) at worst is just going to be dulled a little by the wire (copper). I guess you assumed I meant just grab the nearest knife and start hacking at it on the floor, Conan-style.    Oh grow up   Oooh, I'm so ""rekt."""

After all, it's ""his fault"" for being alone in this dangerous environment with machinery and other hazards where he could have died alone with none the wiser. That's not safe work practices, don'cha'know!  Unfortunately the reality is people sometimes make mistakes. People at their jobs are often expected to perform and behave like machinery; methodical, calculated, and infallible. Basically, nothing like the dynamic and emotional creatures we really are. This guy here admitted to doing something stupid, even though he was in a sticky shitty situation where it's easy to make mistakes like that.

There is almost no incentive here in America to save money, and many people couldn't save even if they wanted to.  This was a guy who was used to making $150,000+ a year and to suddenly have to pay thousands for medical bills with insurance and having to give up working and be permanently limited in his physical activities.  This guy should have been saving money but there was no immediate incentive for him to do so.  Similar thing happened to my dad as well, he ran his own business for 25 years and after an accident he hurt his shoulder and could only work 4-6 hours a day, light duty (as opposed to the 12-16 he had been doing).  Now my parents barely scrape by, they emptied savings accounts and my dad should be retiring due to his injury but instead he is forced to keep working just to keep bills paid.  It's really fucked up just how close so many of us in America are to financial ruin by just a single accident.  Another example is someone that works for one of my friends as a school janitor.  The guy used to be a carpenter, but had an accident that left him partially mentally impaired (fell off a house).  Super nice guy but he works 3 part time jobs (janitor, Mcdonalds, and Taco Bell).  He knows that there is some public assistance available to him but he has been convinced by the right wing in this country that welfare is the devil so he refuses to take the help.  So he keep working 3 part time jobs with no benefits, because he doesn't have the mental capacity anymore to do the kind of job that has good benefits (my friend has been pushing to get him full time, and we think he likely get a full time janitor gig he just interviewed for at another school in the district so he will be paid more and get a really nice benefit package).

OSHA,3b7amz,jocobe31,11,Fri Jun 26 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who has had to work on antennas like that installation in the past - that's fucked up, man.   Firstly, they're not load-rated for people standing on them. Second, the little track/bar in the back used to adjust the mechanical downtilt is picky and precise; it needs to be able to adjust in 1/16th increments (for some antennas).  When a load is placed on it, it not only moves the antenna out of alignment, but it usually wrecks this track, meaning you have to denergize the site, pull all the seals off, pull all the connectors off, pull the antenna off, pull the mounting hardware off, replace the adjustor mount, and then put it all back together.  Sometimes, you can get this done in ninety minutes or so.  Usually, it's about four to six hours, because the mounting hardware is as picky as the antenna. Third, when the antennas are out of alignment, the signal strength / signal coverage in the area goes to crap.  Customers WILL notice this, when they're driving along a highway and their phone just cuts out because of bit-error rate.  People are very sensitive to this.  Moreso on Verizon than on AT&T - I fear that on AT&T they've already given up for a lot of spots.  But for the locations or drives or areas that were known to work once, the expectation is that they'll continue working. On the plus side, this is a four-antenna installation, so there is some redundancy, but you'll trade off signal quality when the sector/path is under load. (Rush hour is murder.) Forth, I take pride in my work.  I take pride in having it done right the first time.  Some minor adjustments here and there are totally routine. But if I have to keep going out to the same location and fixing the same thing because some asshat decided to stand on my non-load-bearing antenna cluster - fuck that.  I hate cleaning up other peoples messes, and I hate re-doing work because some inconsiderate asshole couldn't be bothered to respect hard work someone else already did.   I'm all for ""Shut up and get the job done."", but not when you tread on my shit and make me re-do the same job four times to fix what you felt like stepping on."

We used a 60ft stick boom to access the roof and stepped from the cage to the plant deck..  This is technically a big no no ,but realistically I would have more chance of falling out of my bath..unfortunately we were spotted by somebody with nothing better to do ,who then proceeds to contact head of airport buildings.  Five minutes later she pulls up and starts screeching like a goddamn banshee.. Has totally lost her shit and kicks us off site promising that we would never work of airport property again..  Rules are rules, but her response was pretty overkill.? I'm just happy I was following the bosses lead when we got reamed!!"

Also the boiler house caught fire a couple time per year before the big fire destroyed the whole building.   I sometimes used it to fill up my water container if I didn't feel like going all the way to the break room (another 100 yards approximately).  It didn't actually have a drain which seemed odd but I guess a wet floor in the event of eye wash was considered acceptable.

The school was an old 1960's building with an AC that barely functioned.   Also on this particular day I decided that breakfast and lunch were not going to happen.  Cue the movie,  part way though just as the spike is launched into his head....I pass out.  Head slammed into desk passed out.  Fell out of my seat and landed with my legs stuck in the chair.  I woke up 5 min later with the teacher on the phone with the nurse and another teacher calling 911.  me being a 16 year old boy decided that I need to somehow make this look kewl,  decided I needed to sit up.  In the process of doing so managed to get a head rush and promptly pass out again.  Head-Floor.  I awoke to the medics lifting me into the stretcher.    A nice little trip to the hospital showed dehydration,  heat exhaustion, and  mild concussion.

A lot of the problem with Gage's case study is that very little actually information about him before the incident is scientifically valid. Also, a lot of the information about how his personality changed was sensationalized by news papers and makes it difficult to ascertain what was true and what was exaggerated to make a better story in the local paper. But most importantly, it turns out that in later years Gage managed to recover from his trauma, getting a job for several years driving a carriage.  So, while Gage does still make a strong case for localisation, it makes a stronger case for neuroplasticity.

OSHA,3az0j1,justhisguyouknow,18,Thu Jun 25 06:51:40 2015 UTC,"Phineas Gage:       Phineas P. Gage (1823 – May 21, 1860) was an American railroad construction foreman remembered for his improbable [B1]:19 survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining twelve years of his life—​effects so profound that (for a time at least) friends saw him as ""no longer Gage.""  Long known as ""the American Crowbar Case""—​once termed ""the case which more than all others is calcu­lat­ed to excite our wonder, impair the value of prog­no­sis, and even to subvert our physiolog­ical doctrines""‍ ​Phineas Gage influenced nineteenth-century discussion about the mind and brain, partic­u­lar­ly debate on cerebral locali­za­tion, [M]:ch7-9 [B] and was perhaps the first case to suggest that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific person­al­i­ty changes. [M]:1 [M3]:C  Gage is a fixture in the curricula of neurology, psychology, and related disciplines (see neuroscience),  [M7]:149 ""a living part of the medical folklore""‍ [R]:637 frequently mentioned in books and scientific papers; [M]:ch14 he even has a minor place in popular culture.  Despite this celebrity the body of established fact about Gage and what he was like (before or after his injury) is small,  which has allowed ""the fitting of almost any theory [desired] to the small number of facts we have""‍ [M]:290—​Gage acting as a ""Rorschach inkblot""‍  in which proponents of various conflicting theories of the brain were able to find support for their views. Historically, published accounts (including scientific ones) have almost always severely distorted and exaggerated Gage's behavioral changes, frequently contradicting the known facts.  A report of Gage's physical and mental condition shortly before his death implies that his most serious mental changes were temporary, so that in later life he was far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than in the years immediately following his accident. A social recovery hypothesis suggests that his employment as a stagecoach driver in Chile provided daily structure allowing him to relearn lost social and personal skills.

OSHA,3az0j1,TheRighteousTyrant,5,Wed Jun 24 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"One of the guys on r/welding suggested leaving an inch of metal behind and slowly heating it until the pieces separate.

There are options, this guy likely thought ""Hey, no big deal. I don't think it can hurt me even if it does swing which is never going to happen. YOLO."""
OSHA,3az0j1,WillR,3,Thu Jun 25 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"The process we use in the oil patch is to use heavy equipment or bracing to support both side of the material being cut. This allows the torch man or machinery cutting the material security. Once cut, the machinery can slowly let off the tension."

OSHA,3atozi,Br0_J_Simpson,2,Tue Jun 23 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"It's not a really great idea.  The general thought is that there is plenty of ventilation, and that the amount of CO that it throws out will be diluted.  However, there are times when this breaks down.  If there are problems with ventilation (malfunction fans, clogged exhausts), or if a unit is used heavily in a small area there can be problems.  I've personally treated several workers for CO in situations like this."
OSHA,3atozi,AlienDelarge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:11:57 2015 UTC,Internal combustion for lifts are used inside all the time as long as there is enough ventilation to keep the air safe.

OSHA,3atozi,The_Didlyest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:02:42 2015 UTC,Oddly enough the last foundry I worked in mostly used propane lifts throughout melting and heat treat. The current foundry doesn't but only because they have plenty of overhead cranes and no floor space.

OSHA,3azew7,maybe_apathetic,10,Wed Jun 24 18:58:32 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I am seeing what's wrong with this one... other than the missing hand hole cover.  Which probably isn't an OSHA issue since most likely the cover was properly installed but removed by punk/curious kids or copper thieves.  While the hole cover should be replaced this isn't an especially dangerous occurrence.  Every other light-post in my town looks like this.  I'm going to have to go back and see if there was something else in this picture that I wasn't quite getting...
OSHA,3azew7,buckydean,9,Thu Jun 25 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's not really dangerous, even with the rain, unless you reach in there and actually cut wires or remove wirenuts. That being said, It definitely needs to be covered asap."

OSHA,3aqfb5,inviscidfluid,51,Mon Jun 22 21:48:15 2015 UTC,"For keeping people healthier?  Yes.  But asbestos law is a bit tricky.  Use of asbestos isn't illegal.  Installation is.  That's why there are still houses with asbestos in them and their homeowners don't get arrested.  No one takes down asbestos until you have a reason to.  If it's just hanging out in your walls it isn't hurting anyone.  Of course, that's not the case here because it's not just hanging out in a wall not hurting someone."
OSHA,3aqfb5,soil_nerd,29,Mon Jun 22 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but it is my understanding that the use of asbestos isn't illegal either.

OSHA,3aqfb5,inviscidfluid,16,Thu Jul 2 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"of course, what really exposes the absurdity of the supposedly tight regulation of asbestos is the fact that they still use it in brake pads"
OSHA,3aqfb5,Eric_the_Barbarian,12,Tue Jun 23 00:49:46 2015 UTC,My dad worked in the auto industry for a long time buying parts to make braking systems. He remembers the guys making drum brakes using drills to punch holes in the asbestos liners and then sitting there eating their lunch off of their lap as they continued to work.
OSHA,3aqfb5,inviscidfluid,15,Tue Jun 23 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"The eating of lunch is probably a lot better than the drilling. If it gets eaten, then it's not going into the lungs. Then again, it's still totally going into the lungs because the really fine particles (the ones that cause the problems) are totally still hanging in the air that they are breathing."
OSHA,3aqfb5,KingVape,10,Tue Jun 23 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Oh they were drilling without respirators, but also eating lunch with shavings on it.

OSHA,3aqfb5,Quaeras,23,Mon Jun 22 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"Asbestos mitigation usually means ""seal in place"" rather than attempting to remove. It's generally far more dangerous to try to remove it than to simply enclose it and keep it from getting airborne.   However, this particular instance is an exception to that general practice. This should be removed."

OSHA,3aqfb5,AniGamor,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:26:49 2015 UTC,What country are you in? Across the board in Canada removal is the standard operation. You can have inspectors shut down your entire site until all of the contaminated material is remediated.
OSHA,3aqfb5,sndtech,7,Tue Jun 23 07:28:54 2015 UTC,"Asbestos isn't anymore illegal in Canada than it is in the US or Mexico.  It is just a mineral.  The only time it is ever dangerous is if you're smashing it into pieces.   If the asbestos doesn't need to be disturbed, it is fine.  If it risks damage from some activity, it needs to be removed.  You'll almost never see it removed from walls or HVAC systems.  Floors will often get coated with an epoxy and have a new floor places on top of them.  When you have to tear shit up for demo that is when you'll see pressure negative seals and hazmat suits.     What gives you lung cancer?  Having that shit broken up near you to where you're exposed to particles every single day.  Shipyard workers were the most affected.   If you work with sand, cement, or anything else dusty you risk lung cancer too.   Lungs do not like being constantly irritated, it makes them so weird shit.  You would imagine that an organ whose job is to expose blood to oxygen would be temperamental."
OSHA,3aqfb5,classic__schmosby,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:30:12 2015 UTC,Canada sold and shipped asbestos products worldwide and domestically until at least 2012. The government of Canada even funded a chrysotile institution to promote it.

It was commonly used in obvious form but also mixed with other materials (like old vinyl like floor tile).  Look at your deed to get the date of construction.  As long as asbestos is not crumbling, flaking, or powdering, the risk is low as long as you don't disturb it during renovations.  If it is present, the usual strategy is to contain it with specific paint like products mentioned elsewhere in this thread.  It is very technical to remove asbestos safely and it legally has to be done by a licensed contractor who takes all sorts of precautions.  If you have an old house and you want to remove anything during renovations, get a licensed asbestos evaluation to tell you what to leave undisturbed.  This is not DIY."

OSHA,3aqfb5,ghyit1,3,Mon Jun 22 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"Well, not really.  Unlike asbestosis, mesothelioma is a cancer and can be initiated by almost any exposure.  There are plenty of cases where the exposure was either secondary (worker bringing home dirty clothing) or thought to be trivial (the accountant/secretary working the office above the shop).  Those people didn't have heavy exposure, just really bad luck."
OSHA,3aqfb5,Agent_Ozzy,3,Tue Jun 23 01:32:04 2015 UTC,It's still a are cancer.  Even in asbestos environments.  I'm more worried about the other issues asbestos causes.

OSHA,3aqbta,bandit25,59,Mon Jun 22 17:20:59 2015 UTC,Fairly normal in Korea and the Philippines if I remember correctly. I viewed a huge album of these shower heads and this isn't even close to some of the more scary set-ups. Apparently it is not uncommon to get a slight shock every once in a while when using one of these.
OSHA,3aqbta,chiggawat,21,Mon Jun 22 19:02:45 2015 UTC,I have never seen one of these. How does it work? Is there a heating element in the head there or something? I'd be surprised it could heat the water quick enough for a hot shower.
OSHA,3aqbta,GldRush98,18,Mon Jun 22 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"I used this source for typical shower head flow rate.  8 L/min * 4.2 J/K.g * 1000 g/L * 1min/60s = 560 W/K   That's pretty tough. But that page also mention flow as low as 2 L/min as being acceptable for showering. 220V * 10A = 2 kW, so I guest you can get as high as 15 degrees of heating at that low flow rate. Possible, and dangerous, but this is /r/OSHA after all."

What you said about the cycling is what I hate the most about it. Literally every time I would take a shower, there would be a moment where the water would go cold on me. I thought it was because there was maybe a threshold that I had to meet in terms of flow (I still think that's true, because if the shower water wasn't warm enough, the hot water would cut off and never come back on until I increased the flow), but even at higher temperatures it would still cycle."

Every safety class I've been to tells you to properly block and secure a lift. This has the potential of serious injury and/or death. I've seen new techs do this and immediately stop them and show them how to correctly work on the underside of a walkie rider.   The proper method here would be to take the battery out and flip the walkie on its side. Eliminating any chance of a crushing injury.  Or if you are just changing a caster or drive tire you would jack it up and block it.   Ps. I would let Crown know their tech is working unsafe in your building.

OSHA,3aqv67,paulcam,2,Tue Jun 23 15:34:24 2015 UTC,Is it the safest way to do it? Probably not. Is it that dangerous? meh. Auto mechanics use lifts for several ton vehicles that don't provide any more protection than that.
OSHA,3aqv67,PulledOverAgain,23,Mon Jun 22 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"Not true. Auto lifts have locks to prevent dropping the load in case of hydraulic failure.   Automatic Safety Locks  These powerful load-holding devices automatically engage and lock the lift structure as the car lift raises, preventing sudden free fall in the unlikely event of a suspension component failure. Typically, after the lift is raised to the required working height, operators are instructed to lower the lift until it is resting safely on the locks to minimize wear on suspension components. Once the locks are engaged, the car lift has to be raised slightly in order to release the safety locks. The better car lifts on the market often have locks spaced no more than five inches apart to better protect operators or bystanders. Load-holding devices should always require an independent and positive action for release, and they should always engage and reset automatically each time the lift is raised."
OSHA,3aqv67,62rambler,2,Mon Jun 22 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"I was not aware of that, it makes sense though. I was thinking more about the likelihood of the car (or floor cleaner in this case) to fall off the lift, assuming the lift it self doesn't fail. I would guess the weight of the floor cleaner is way way way below the max load of that lift and the chance of it failing are low."
OSHA,3aqv67,Captain_Comrade,7,Mon Jun 22 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"Possibly true that the weight is below rated max, but hydraulics can fail catastrophically below their rated max due to manufacturing defects or bad maintenance."
OSHA,3aqv67,M0TUS,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:45 2015 UTC,Just the battery in that lift (the one being worked on) is around 1750 lbs.
OSHA,3aqv67,Ralaar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:32:59 2015 UTC,The reach truck holding the walkie does have a flow control and a load holding valve. If a major leak occurred in the lifting system it would prevent the load from dropping. The major problem with the situation is the walkie sliding off the forks of the reach truck. You have smooth metal forks holding a oddly balanced smooth metal walkie. Most of the weight is the battery (sitting over reach truck forks) and the drive unit compartment that the tech is sitting under. What usually happens is the walkie slides off the reach truck forks. Right where he is siting.

There is no way this many people could live from only fishing. Not to mention that the ganges delta which covers most of the country has some of the most fertile soil in the world, combined with perfect climate and is located at an important trade junction (all of these were a much important part of their economy historically than fishing).  Only 200.000 people are employed in the shipbreaking businesses, which is actually very profitable for the country, although dangerous for the workers. It provides them with half of all their consumption of steel for basically free.   To comment on the ""toxic waste"" claim: This is a graph displaying the output of aquaculture of Bangladesh over the years. You can easily see that the aquaculture is at an all time high and was 13-times larger in 2010 than it was in 1980.  http://www.fao.org/fi/figis/graphs/countrysector/Aquaculture/16.gif In addition to that, the pollution that would come from ships like these is nothing in comparison to what a developing country of a few hundred million people, surrounded by a few more billion people, outputs to the sea."

OSHA,3aiz7p,soggyballsack,20,Sun Jun 21 18:46:38 2015 UTC,No and no.  The construction industry is heavily regulated. Not having workers comp insurance means you don't get building permits.   Getting caught building without those things and with illegal workers means losing your license and a lot of fines.  Nowadays people's lives aren't at risk building things in the US like those are in the OP.

OSHA,3aiz7p,fiercelyfriendly,-1,Sun Jun 21 18:16:04 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Was it always handled so carefully? I asked because many of these boats are in service for 30+ years before they are scrapped and exchanged between many different countries before they reach that point.

Sure, we might think it's insanity to work under these conditions, but for the locals having a job means the difference between life and death. In that case working in a clothing factory or ship breaking operation often has more respect and a higher pay than traditional jobs in agriculture or household production. So at the end of the day this is a win-win situation for both the ship owners and the local population. Once Bangladesh gets its act together and can provide good pay for healthy work I'm sure we will see this occur less and less until it finally moves up into the ranks of /r/OSHA approved territory."

Even better, it shows one of the photos from that group.  Conclusion?  At least some of those pictures are from Greece, not Bangladesh.  EDIT: LINK"

OSHA,3aiz7p,hydrogen18,2,Sun Jun 21 06:36:38 2015 UTC,Also most shipbreakers immediately cut a hole in the side of the ship well below the waterline. That tends to solve the whole 'floating away' thing.

OSHA,3aiz7p,czechm8e,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Ship breaking is frequently described as the most dangerous (civilian) job in the world. see e.g.  http://www.salon.com/2013/03/21/shipbreaking_worlds_most_dangerous_job_partner/   The work of destroying this epic trash is left to the world’s most desperate laborers, who earn a handful of dollars a day, and benefit from only rudimentary safety precautions. It is a grueling and dangerous pursuit — by some assessments, the world’s deadliest job.  “Ship breaking is an incredibly dangerous industry, we believe it’s one of the most hazardous occupations in the world,” a Pakistan representative from the International Labor Organization (ILO), who declined to give his name because he wasn’t authorized to speak with the media, says in a phone interview. “Every year thousands of people die at ship breaking yards in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.”  At Gaddani, the exact death toll is hard to come by — for reasons that illustrate the precarious status of the migrant laborers who work here. One shipbreaker tells GlobalPost (in Urdu) that because laborers aren’t registered, victims simply disappear, cast aside as human refuse; as he says this, a union leader cuts him off, and an argument ensues in Pashto, the language of the migrants."
OSHA,3aiz7p,BomptonBrotha88,-2,Sun Jun 21 03:04:16 2015 UTC,They estimate one death per week so 52 yearly compared to 5.5k from coal mining its not even close imo.
OSHA,3aiz7p,Ekanselttar,3,Sun Jun 21 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"52 yearly out of 8000~22,000 estimated employees. That's a rate of 240~650 deaths per 100,000, which is more than double any job in the US at the low end. There might be some other jobs outside the states with comparable stats, but shipbreaking is at the very least a strong contender worldwide."
OSHA,3aiz7p,BomptonBrotha88,2,Sun Jun 21 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't talking about the USA only, but the whole coal mining industry worldwide. Most of the trauma/accidental deaths are in China at this point, but I'm not sure about coal miner's lung or other slow exposure caused deaths. I could have swore I read 200k people were employed in the ship breaking industry, if not then oops my mistake."
OSHA,3aiz7p,BomptonBrotha88,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"It is estimated that over 100,000 workers are employed at ship breaking yards worldwide. Of the approximate 45,000 ocean-going ships in the world about 700 are taken out of service every year. At the end of their sailing life, ships are sold so that the valuable steel - about 95% of a ships mass can be reused.   http://www.shipbreakingbd.info/overview.html  this site claims 100k workers, which lowers the deaths per 100k a fair amount.

We had a new guy who was driving the lift once and hit one of the gas heaters they had installed in the ceiling.  These things were huge and actually blew heat right out of the bay doors into the backs of the trucks because of how deathly cold it would get doing this bullshit job at 3 am.  He was actually a really cool guy and just made a mistake.  The forks had this unnecessary cage around the top (thanks Hyster!).  He was really shook up about it and I tried to console him and tell him that he would probably still get to keep his job.  He didn't.  They fired him like 10 minutes later.  I felt so guilty after that.  I saw some of the most dangerous shit ever to happen with forklifts at that job.  We had squeeze lifts too, which was a totally different animal."

It's why falls and electrocution are some of the most common causes of death in OSHA statistics.

OSHA,3ajeqf,whatnoreally,4,Sun Jun 21 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"It most definitely is less safe than a de-energized circuit, it's just that there are allowances for doing it when it's necessary for troubleshooting, but that doesn't mean the risk is reduced.

OSHA,3advka,imranilzar,11,Fri Jun 19 13:27:44 2015 UTC,Most normal tires your supposed to strap a seat belt over top of them. We never used the seat belt. Only these big tires usually fly off like this.
OSHA,3advka,Hello-Universe,5,Fri Jun 19 14:05:07 2015 UTC,Weird. Our mechanics work on the tire on some machine. It has 3 control pedals which grab and hold the tire. It doesn't seem to have any protection when inflating it. After this they transfer it to another machine for the balance. It spins the tire at some speed and there it have a protective hood coming down.
OSHA,3advka,imranilzar,2,Fri Jun 19 15:57:53 2015 UTC,The first machine with 3 pedals and a spinning deck should have a vertical seat belt.  If it doesn't than its an older machine. Some guys remove them too.

OSHA,3advka,imranilzar,3,Sat Jun 20 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah same process at my shop. There's really no danger inflating a car tire. Just keep you hands away put your goggles and ear plugs on and you're good to go. If the tire does burst, 40-60 psi will not rip that tire off the rim and into you, wherever the weak point is, air will rush out at an alarming and loud rate, but not be deadly. It can be dangerous if you don't have that tire secured while inflating though. I saw one idiot inflate a tire on the ground because his hose wouldn't reach, and while he was doing that, the bead sealed so fast that the tire went up in the air and broke his jaw. I didn't fee sorry for him."
OSHA,3advka,rcthephotoman,8,Fri Jun 19 16:48:49 2015 UTC,"Please don't tell people that inflating car tires isn't dangerous. You can still be seriously hurt if a small tire explodes. I have personally seen the results of passenger tires letting go,  and it's no joke.   I've seen a tire separate at less than 30psi. The rim and tire stayed on the machine,  but the installer was knocked back, and had to take the rest of the day off to get his bearings straight.   I've seen two guys get their arms broken when they tried to overinflate a tire to seat it.  The tire flew off the whole rim, broke their arms on the way up,  and hit the ceiling which was 40 feet up.   Stay safe, use your PPE, and some common sense,  people."
OSHA,3advka,tdotgoat,4,Fri Jun 19 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"Not to be an asshole, i am sincere as possible, but use your common sense to see that (If it was the same machine) the machine is inflating these tires WAY to fast and that is why you see an explosion at 30p.s.i."

OSHA,3advka,imranilzar,3,Fri Jun 19 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"Never an exploding tire, just a mechanic taking the tre off the machine before the bead was sealed, and once he or she bounces it on the ground, that's enough force to seat the bead and BAM! it throws itself into the wall or up into your jaw, or pinches one of your fingers."
OSHA,3advka,rcthephotoman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"the bead sealed so fast   What does that mean?  Also, I have a small air compressor in my trunk I use for my tires.  Am I in reasonable danger when I use it to refill my tires to about 32psi?"
OSHA,3advka,Soranic,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yes you are in danger of a tire ""exploding"" but likely, that your tire pressure would take maybe 45 minutes with a pump that plugs into a 12volt system to reach 40psi. But you still run a risk of exploding a tire.  Anyone does. So basically, if you are on the side of the road with a flat, and you are worried about exploding a tire, just check the pressure."
OSHA,3advka,rcthephotoman,2,Sat Jun 20 08:04:31 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of that before.  Regular car tires are much lower pressure than truck tires, and nowhere near as dangerous."
OSHA,3advka,sirblastalot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:18:08 2015 UTC,Oh I agree. Not really necessary. I tried to find an image but it appears most machines don't even have one. I've worked for 3 tire shops and they all had similar machines.  The belt ran up the side vertically and the diagrams instructed strapping it over the tire incase of a blow out.  We've never used them.

OSHA,3advka,bedhed,2,Fri Jun 19 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"All wheels have a lip, or rim, on each side to hold the bead of the tire.  Deforming a tire to get it over this lip is a pain in the rear, especially when only using hand tools. In order to solve this problem, wheels were manufactured where one lip is removable, so the tire can be slid on or off the wheel easily.This removable lip is held on with a lock ring, and if there's a problem with the parts or their assembly, the lock ring and lip can fly off explosively."

He got his tools all unloaded and everything, first thing they want him to do is mount a tire.  He asks about a cage and is told they don't use them there.  He pondered it for a minute, and politely told his new supervisor that if that was how they operated, he didn't need to be working there.  Packed up his tools and left without doing a single job.

OSHA,3advka,whatsupallday,5,Mon Jun 22 09:42:34 2015 UTC,"I would assume that you don't mount the tire inside the cage, rather, you just inflate the tire in the cage."
OSHA,3advka,pumpkinrum,2,Mon Jun 22 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"You mount the tire outside the cage, then put it inside the cage for inflation."

OSHA,3a87p0,flying87,80,Thu Jun 18 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"I wasn't there to see what happened, but without knowing anything for fact I'll still tell you exactly what happened:  Step 1: operator catches shirt on E-STOP button; accidentally rips it off.  Step 2: operator, partly out of laziness and partly out of irrational fear of getting in trouble, makes sure nobody saw them break it, and then tapes the button back on top of the control, after which, he pats himself on the back for saving the button and doing his good deed for the day.   Step 3: time passes, and everyone sees the button is broken and says to themselves,  ""wow, someone should really put in a maintenance request to have that thing fixed...yeah...someone...""  Step 4: Maintenance uses this control VERY frequently to program the robot.  Everyone in maint has seen this problem at some point and still chooses to thoroughly ignore it, as they absolutely refuse to do anything if a maintenance request work order has not been filled out. If asked, they will deny ever having seen the problem.  Step 5: Yours Truly happens to meander by and notices the problem. I ask the operator what happened and get a response that goes something like, ""dude, it's been like this for at least the last month..."" When asked if anyone has put in a maint request, I am greeted by a blank stare.   Step 6: I take picture and post to reddit. I then fill out a maint request and turn it in. It will be fixed in a day or two, as soon as parts arrive.  Such is the daily struggle of being a supervisor  edit: a word"
OSHA,3a87p0,phqu88,17,Thu Jun 18 05:14:52 2015 UTC,I'm gonna guess there is a stupid rule that maintenance men can't fill out a request form themselves.

OSHA,3a3q1b,contrarian_barbarian,6,Wed Jun 17 07:39:33 2015 UTC,"Forging temperature of mild steel is roughly 1700F-2100F. This would be the range you'd use for blacksmithing - that's hot enough to do major shaping and welding of the pieces of metal. It's significantly weakened at that temperature, but still well stronger than putty. It actually melts north of 2600F.  The biggest risk with those temperatures is messing up the heat treatment. You can make it quite brittle if you heat and cool it wrong at those temperatures, which creates a potential for failure the next time you use it after it cools back down."

OSHA,3a3q1b,contrarian_barbarian,3,Wed Jun 17 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"4150 chromoly steel is the standard type used for milspec gun barrels. It is rather considerably stronger than 1020 mild steel - it requires roughly 25% more force to bend it, and twice the force to break it. That said, they are both mild alloys with similar melting points (~2700F), so I'd imagine they're weakened a similar percent at the different temperatures, 4150 is just stronger to begin with so it needs a bit more heat to weaken to the point where it starts deforming under the same stress as 1020.

Adding 5 amps, 5 amps, and 5 amps of A B and C phase would net a 0 balance on the neutral.   Good luck finding 3 loads pulling exactly 5 amps on their respective phases though!

The lugs could glow red hot and the insulation could melt off the wire very quickly, BUT!! this is why they make circuit breakers and fuses. In a short circuit the fuse or breaker will give in a fraction of a second (unless it's made by GE) and open the circuit before severe damage can occur.

OSHA,3a3q1b,cosmicsans,16,Wed Jun 17 01:50:09 2015 UTC,High resistance would lower the current. This is the result of too much current passing through the electrical connection. There is a short somewhere in the circuit or this was not designed for the application load. I'm not an EE but this is what V=IR tells us. Always stick to the fundamentals.   Edit: I may be incorrect. Second guessing yourself sucks but you learn a lot. Read edits below.   Yep definitely wrong as fuck. But I learned something cool.

OSHA,3a3q1b,JohnProof,2,Wed Jun 17 02:07:11 2015 UTC,Correct. As another redditor explained to me. In my own attempt to stay with the fundamentals I fundamentally fucked up the circuit I was analyzing.
OSHA,3a3q1b,spheredick,2,Wed Jun 17 02:54:39 2015 UTC,"Ohm's law states that I (current) = V (voltage) / R (resistance).  Assuming the input voltage stays constant, lower resistances will allow more current to flow, causing more power (P (power) = I (current) * V (voltage)) to flow .  The resistance is important, though, because that's what causes the cable to actually heat up (a superconducting cable doesn't).  It's also important in an actual heating element because the (relatively high) resistance limits the current flow and keeps the wire from self-destructing.  An electric range element is typically 20-120 ohms."
OSHA,3a3q1b,sparks277,5,Wed Jun 17 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"The resistance of that connection is a tiny portion of the impedance of the circuit.

Following that, for an essentially fixed curent, the only thing that determines if a connection runs hot is the resistance of that joint.  If resistance goes up, power loss across the connection goes up, and heat dissipated goes up."
OSHA,3a3q1b,JohnProof,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"The resistance of that connection is a tiny portion of the impedance of the circuit.   Not in a short circuit, which others were hinting at and I had on my mind.  A good point, though.   If resistance goes up, power loss across the connection goes up, and heat dissipated goes up.   sparks277 clarified, that's what s/he meant...  and this also still technically limits the current flow, but obviously not enough if that's the failure mode here!  Judging by the surrounding area on the bus bar, I guess it's probably not a short after all since it looks this connection has been regularly running at high temperatures."
OSHA,3a3q1b,spheredick,3,Wed Jun 17 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, I concede that there was a decent amount of current flowing through that connection for that to happen. But it's kind of like admitting my gun is not very deadly without any bullets in it.  The filament of a light blub has very high resistance and only 1/2 an amp flowing thru it (120v 60w) but it's so hot it would burn into nothingness in a fraction of a second if it weren't in a vacuum."
OSHA,3a3q1b,sparks277,2,Wed Jun 17 02:15:47 2015 UTC,Exactly.  A lightbulb filament is a great example.
OSHA,3a3q1b,spheredick,2,Wed Jun 17 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from (see JohnProof's reply), but I have to take issue with this:   The filament of a light blub has very high resistance and only 1/2 an amp flowing thru it (120v 60w) but it's so hot it would burn into nothingness in a fraction of a second if it weren't in a vacuum.   R = V / I = 120 V / 0.5 A = 240 ohms.  I wouldn't call that very high.  :)"
OSHA,3a3q1b,JohnProof,2,Wed Jun 17 02:21:18 2015 UTC,When it comes a loose connection like this one it is! LOL. Maybe you're more used to resistors in electronics that go into the thousands of Ohms. Put 120v on one of them and see how hot it gets. :-) I just know I've fixed many burned up wires and lugs due to loose connections and they were never pulling crazy amperage across the circuit.
OSHA,3a3q1b,spheredick,2,Wed Jun 17 02:37:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually came to the same realization and was editing another comment to that effect when I saw your reply -- the industries we work in have biased our sense of scale.  To me (working mostly with electronics), ""very high"" resistance makes me think megaohms, but a resistance of ""only"" 100kohm would limit you to 2.3 watts through the circuit assuming 480V (and I'm guessing that bar is actually lower voltage).  Of course, 240 ohms across a connection is bad news at low or high voltage, but especially at high voltages since low currents can dissipate lots of power!  So yeah, just differences in perspective I think: one camp is thinking that the resistance of the entire circuit going up (from what was assumed a short circuit) which would lower current/power disspiration, which is true; the other is thinking resistance of the connection is...  unacceptably high, which is also a very plausible theory.  Especially since the OP's comments suggest that they don't know exactly what the cause was.  Like your lightbulb example, even at a ""mere"" 500mA and 240 ohms, at 120V that's 60W of energy that does not belong at the connection point!"
OSHA,3a3q1b,XenonHippogriff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Very high is a relative measure.  When I'm testing the condition of a power distribution termination, I want to see a resistance of <0.0001 ohms.  250 ohms and things would be on fire, so it depends on the application."
OSHA,3a3q1b,masuk0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Very high is a relative measure.   Totally, and that's clearly where our conversation broke down.  Obviously 250 ohms through a connection is really high, but I was thinking of the resistance of the entire load on the assumption that it was a short (since that's what OP's comment said).  This comment chain makes me think that OP doesn't actually know the nature of the fault, so high resistance at the connection point sounds very plausible."

OSHA,3a3q1b,Sysiphuslove,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"Nope. This is resistance in the connection which raised, when it got dirty and corrupted with time. This added additional load in a form of visible heat emission. Current may be the same, but voltage dropped on the real load. So, short circuit is critical to power source and leads to voltage drop. In this case source works normally but supplies energy not to consumer but just heats connection with high resistance."

OSHA,3a3q1b,SirDigbyChknCaesar,24,Wed Jun 17 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"EE undergrad senior here. High or low resistance? Here is the answer: That connection has a resistance value that is moderately close to the load's resistance, but still relatively low (lower than kOhm). Picture two resistors in series. One being the wire/connection and the other being the load. In most applications, you'd like your wire resistance to be much lower than the load. If it's a short, your wire then becomes the load. If the wire resistance is equal to the load, then the load and wire will each output the same amount of energy with the wire outputting all heat.  There are three reasons why the wire may be hot.   Bad connection (1 ohm instead of 0.001 ohm). The wire is to small for the load (5 Ohm wire with a 30 Ohm load). There is a short and now the wire is your load.

Dienes currently used in the manufacture of EPDM rubbers are dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), ethylidene norbornene (ENB), and vinyl norbornene (VNB). EPDM rubber is closely related to ethylene propylene rubber (ethylene propylene rubber is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene, whereas EPDM rubber is a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene, and a diene-component).

OSHA,3a1507,TattooYouTooBabou,12,Tue Jun 16 15:01:05 2015 UTC,it has rubber roofing over the top of it but it most likely has plywood underneath which is fine.

OSHA,3a1507,tucci007,-27,Wed Jun 17 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"meh, either way its labeled appropriately, its in an area that's obviously not open to the public and if anyone walks on a well labeled hole they deserve whats coming."
OSHA,3a1507,MrMallow,25,Tue Jun 16 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Except that it's open to workers. This type of shit is why people die on constructions sites everyday, along with mentalities like yours. I know you're probably mostly kidding but I've seen/treated guys that have gotten seriously hurt because of dumb ass, lazy shit just like this. It annoys me, but it's job security."
OSHA,3a1507,TheGreatGuidini,-31,Tue Jun 16 17:00:04 2015 UTC,if your working in a construction site or similar industry you should always be alert and aware of your surroundings.

OSHA,3a1507,irishjihad,12,Tue Jun 16 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"Except that on a floor opening, the intended load would be a person so ~200 lbs. there's needs to be a barrier around that, capable of withstanding 200lbs of lateral pressure. Unless there is plywood under that EPDM, this is not ok."
OSHA,3a1507,TheGreatGuidini,4,Tue Jun 16 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"Correct. 2x the intended load which includes tools carried by the person. Without knowing the strength of the cover in the photo, But the standard has been mostly followed."
OSHA,3a1507,XBLGERMEX,15,Tue Jun 16 17:34:30 2015 UTC,So OSHA will mostly fine the fuck out of you
OSHA,3a1507,TheGreatGuidini,3,Tue Jun 16 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, I agree they will still cite you unless you can demonstrate compliance with the standard."
OSHA,3a1507,XBLGERMEX,10,Tue Jun 16 17:37:03 2015 UTC,Which this scenario doesn't do. This does not comply with the standard unless there's plywood under that hole. Did they do something? Yes. Did they arguably make it worse? Yup. There are lots of idiots on construction sites. This is just inviting a moron to test its strength. The only thing this is doing is stopping debris from falling thru the duct penetration.   I was doing a job where a guy thought it would be a good idea to sit on top of a propane heater because he was cold. Melted his pants to his ass and legs. Nothing surprises me anymore.
OSHA,3a1507,TheGreatGuidini,5,Tue Jun 16 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"This scenario very well may meet the standard. Typically a rubber mat will not support 2x a workers weight with tools, but there are circumstances where it will. How big is the hole underneath? How dense is the rubber in the photo? Maybe there are two small holes beside each other and these workers killed two birds with one rubber mat. Just sayin', yes people are dumb, but we can't deduce exact compliance from this photo. The other parts of the standard have all been met."
OSHA,3a1507,XBLGERMEX,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"I somewhat doubt that the most heavy set man on a construction site, all his tools, and anything you could imagine he's carrying, is going to weigh less than a total of 300lbs"

OSHA,3a3vhm,andr3wrulz,12,Wed Jun 17 02:11:59 2015 UTC,At least jet fuel won't melt it.
OSHA,3a3vhm,FlashingBulbs,9,Wed Jun 17 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"Jet fuel can melt steel rods mate, it's steel beams it can't melt. Difference between a rod and a beam is the diameter."
OSHA,3a3vhm,blaghart,4,Wed Jun 17 04:34:18 2015 UTC,"Actually the reason it can't melt steel beams is due to the glass transition temperature of steel.  It depends on the type of steel though.  But what that means is the temperature is the ultimate decider, not the diameter.  Diameter affects how long it takes to melt, not whether it can or not.  Source: Mechanical Engineer"
OSHA,3a3vhm,Osnarf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well, that's true if the whole beam is exposed to the fire, but if only part of it is could a thick enough and long enough beam not melt if the temperature is high enough to melt steel because the beam acts as a heat sink?"
OSHA,3a3vhm,blaghart,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if it's only part of the beam, as the laws of thermodynamics prevent more energy being absorbed than is being delivered, which means the temperature of the beam can never rise above the temperature of the heat source because temperature is just a difference in internal energy levels."
OSHA,3a3vhm,Osnarf,2,Fri Jun 19 22:38:06 2015 UTC,"You are misunderstanding my question, I think. The heat source is hot enough to melt the steel, but is only applied to part of it. If the piece of steel is large enough, could enough heat be transferred to the air by the parts of the steel which the heat source is not in contact with to keep any of the steel from melting?"
OSHA,3a3vhm,blaghart,2,Sat Jun 20 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"No.  The glass transition temperature of steel is so high compared to the thermal resistivity of steel that it cannot radiate heat quickly enough to prevent transition.    You can test this yourself:  freeze water, and keep it in your freezer or keep subtracting heat to keep it frozen in an open space.  Now get an extreme heat source like a lighter and hold it to a point on your frozen piece of water.  You'll notice it melting, but only in the point of your heat application.  It takes a very large amount of energy to cause any form of matter to change states, far more than it can safely radiate in the previous state (which is why it transitions)."
OSHA,3a3vhm,Osnarf,2,Sat Jun 20 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for explaining."
OSHA,3a3vhm,hydrogen18,6,Sat Jun 20 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"Instead of just falling in the hole and getting hurt, you'll fall in the hole, cut a major artery in your leg & bleed to death.  A+ would endanger lives again."

I worked with a shady company that was contracted to install traffic lights and highway street-light fixtures.  New subdivisions where a common site, but mostly we worked on the expanding highway system installing the lights - from drilling the 15-18 foot holes to screwing on the bulb.  Later I worked in doing drywall and later tiling.  At these sites you have plumbers, electricians, and various small contractors and sub-contractors.  Sound familiar?  If you've ever worked a construction site in your life you'd know what I'm talking about.  Anyway, at these jobs I would occasionally see day laborers or inexperienced guys who lied about their experience.  It was always a poor guy desperate for a job.  I worked with a guy who didn't know how to use a hammer, who later in time got pretty damn good and learned the trade fast.  Some never learn or just quit."

Try to also have a co-signer, your dad, cousin, etc. and that will usually lower your interest rate. Also, remember that you're required to have full coverage insurance when paying a car loan, so that should be taken into account.   The process itself is easy, but can seriously fuck you up if you don't understand it.

You'll get much better terms unless someone is doing a ""0% for 60 months kind of deal on a new car.

OSHA,39tqyg,funnynickname,2,Mon Jun 15 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"A good rate is as follows: Rates as low as 2.49% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) are available for 3-year auto loans $10,000 and higher at 100% loan-to-value (LTV) or less. Rates for loans to purchase a vehicle from a private party, smaller loan amounts, longer terms, vehicles older than 6 model years, or higher LTV may be higher.  Those are dealer rates.  Private party loans are around 5.5 and up.  You'll want a down payment to get your LTV down.  Also, your credit union probably has a $10,000 credit card with a 10% rate that you could use to buy a car, fyi.  That's what they told me to do when I wanted to buy a used car."

OSHA,39r1qm,ccgeogeek,29,Wed Jun 17 02:50:25 2015 UTC,Ah yes the rover 25. Renowned for it's reliability.
OSHA,39r1qm,DanezTHEManez,11,Sat Jun 13 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair, as long as you look after it and replace the head gasket when it starts showing first signs of failure, those things are pretty reliable.   Most people let the head gasket degrade to catastrophic failure and overheat the engine, which deforms the block as it's aluminium, rendering it scrap. They've got a pretty bad record for dying from head gasket failure - yes it will most likely fail, but it's not likely to take the engine with it unless you ignore it."
OSHA,39r1qm,xCP23x,10,Sun Jun 14 08:47:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of cars notorious for being unreliable are more accuretly described as maintenance intensive for common uses. The type of driving can be a big factor, too many people expect all cars to need as much servicing as their toyota camry they drive around the suburbs. Or they wait for catastrophic failures and then the damage compounds (instead of replacing one part early it shatters and wrecks other stuff) itself. They refuse to do anything but the legally required maintenance and then when it goes to hell and they need to replace several parts they complain that it's in the shop for the week and they have no idea what to do. If they addressed the problem 2 months ago then the mechanic could diagnose it, order the part and fit it over a few hours.  Also people who think that a car needing certain compenents replaced a lot automatically means shoddy design, no, making things last for ages isn't always efficient, you replace your tires several times (over the life of the car), same principle. Sure they could spend $2000 on a part and make it last for 10 years or they could spend $100 on it and make it last for 5. Additionally this stuff isn't always predictable, wear patterns can be really weird, do you want to pay twice as much for a part and replace it before it breaks every couple of years OR do you want to just accept that it breaks on average every 8 years? A law of diminishing returns applies to making things durable. If we legislated in more standards to stop this then your car would cost a fucktonne more money and we'd be back where we were 30 years ago when only the super rich families owned 2 cars."

OSHA,39rae8,tenhotuisku,3,Tue Jun 16 17:24:40 2015 UTC,The quality of outside grown weed is nowhere near the stuff you can grow indoors with a controlled light cycle and perfect soil/hydro with a monitored amount of nutrients.  Also since the earth rotates there's only a limited time of year when the day/night cycle is optimal wherever you live.  If you compare the harvests of indoor grown weed and outside grown weed it more than makes up for the electic bill.
OSHA,39rae8,fooliam,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:23:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct insofar as indoor is easier to control, but that doesn't mean outdoor is necessarily lower quality. Most people that grow outdoor don't do it properly and wind up not paying attention to nutrient levels in the soil or conditioning their water, things like that. For those reasons, indoor weed tends to be better, but there is absolutely no reason outdoor can't be as good or superior when it's done correctly."
OSHA,39rae8,tenhotuisku,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:26:37 2015 UTC,Sure but it's a lot harder to control the soil and the nutrient levels etc. in a field than it is in a little box or even a water setup where you can monitor the levels in real time.

That it's satire is very clear once you read it but hearing about it existing is another case entirely.   You could probably ask 10k teens on the streets in Germany, with most of them ofc being at least somewhat decent in English and who also frequently consume English media and I'd gurantee that maybe only 5% know what The Onion is. It's an English news site (satire ofc), but due to this fact many poeple outside of English speaking countries probably haven't heard of it because they don't frequently use regular English news sites either, so something like this flies under their radar as well."

OSHA,39n96o,SplitsAtoms,10,Sat Jun 13 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"I had something similar happen.   I was renting a house and had been there maybe a month. One warm summer day I went to the basement to find a path of water running across my way. I traced it back to a steady trickle coming out of the.... electric panel. The. Electric. Panel. My wife, now behind me, gives me the ""what did you do"" look.   ""I'm not an electrician or plumber, but I'm pretty sure these are two systems that shouldn't be connected. ""  It turns out the old garden hose reel sprang a leak on the outside of the house and water was running down the service drop through the old cracked putty seal into the panel.   Edit: autocowrected."
OSHA,39n96o,SplitsAtoms,2,Sat Jun 13 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"Anecdote 1: I had been in a rental for a few months when the central AC stopped working.  The repairman asked if he could use the hose to spray off some debris.  I remarked that he was using a rather gentle spray, but he explained that he wasn't getting much pressure.  I heard something strange from the basement and discovered where the extra pressure was going.    The previous tenant hadn't disconnected the hose for the winter.  Outside faucets are designed to have the valve inside the house so the pipe doesn't freeze, but that's contingent on the section of pipe between the valve and the outside being able to drain.  Leaving the hose attached meant it couldn't, so the pipe froze and burst inside the house.    I work from home, and the water that was pouring out of the ceiling was only a few feet away from my computers.    Anecdote 2: When I moved into my current place, we replaced the refrigerator.  Both the old and the new had ice makers, so we needed to shut off the saddle valve in the basement.  The valve was old, didn't appreciate being turned off, and proceeded to leak.  I was able to get a large trash can under it, but it was not a happy moment.  When the plumber came out to replace that valve, he noticed that there were two other saddle valves on the pipe.  One was visibly capped off; it had fed the whole-house humidifier when there was one.  The last one was farther down and connected to a black rubber hose.  He followed the hose and discovered that it emptied into the electrical box."

Move in day will be delayed. If that's a concrete sub floor you can put dryer fans under the carpet. Sheet rock and base moulding will need to be replaced. If that's a plywood sub floor you will have insulation below to replace as well. If second floor,well you got all kinds of potential problems. It appears to be a cable TV outlet without the cable. A house we built about 10 years ago we used 2 1/2"" inch trim nails in the gun instead of the 2 inch we always used... hit the water line in two places... it didn't leak like that though, it was slow and steady so we had to replace a bunch of hardwood flooring a few weeks after the people moved in.

OSHA,39lt15,MagJack,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:46:44 2015 UTC,Inspector here...  The majority of extinguishers are not even for employee use. If the employer intends employees to use them they must provide annual training.  So most employers just have them as according to NFPA but everyone evacuates.
OSHA,39lt15,Philanthropiss,-3,Sat Jun 13 01:43:35 2015 UTC,Definitely not in the states. Rarely would you see a foam type extinguisher hanging on a wall. Guess they have ABC covered between the two types.

While playing the tape on a Uher 5000, she answered a phone call. Reaching for the Uher 5000 stop button, she said that she mistakenly hit the button next to it, the record button. For the duration of the phone call, about 5 minutes, she kept her foot on the device's pedal, causing a five-minute portion of the tape to be re-recorded. When she listened to the tape, the gap had grown to 18½ minutes and she later insisted that she was not responsible for the remaining 13 minutes of buzz.

If you can document, concretely, that this is entirely a failing of the company's to address this (whether it's the manager or the owner) you can use it to protect your fellow employees.  If that thing comes down, and there's no evidence to the contrary, the owner could sue the pants off whoever was standing there at the time for damages and lost profit. And that's a lot of booze there. The Smirnoff and the Pinnacle probably go for $15-20 a pop (I'm guessing relative to prices in my state for 1L bottles) but that Ciroc and Grey Goose definitely demands way more. Looks like a lot of them are at least five deep, 26 wide, and six shelves high, that's potentially 780 bottles, and if we assume a mean price of $20 (between the expensive stuff on top and the tiny bottles on the bottom) that's around $15,600 just in damage to booze, not counting the shelves, and time lost in cleanup.

Do that, and send it along with these pictures to the insurance agency when the thing collapses. I'm not sure if they'd be required to show him that your documents and images are why they're denying him, so prepare to be fired if that's the case. But if you can do it so that he can't know it was you and they simply deny him, do it. He totally deserves to have to pay for that himself.

That's a rolling steel door, which means it rolls up like a fruit roll-up, not like that overhead door that killed the dude in the gif in the comments below. You could support the hanging weight of that curtain, in that position, by hand. And if you weren't a wimp, you could probably hold it there with the spring unwound. Those 8-10 exposed slats are only a couple pounds each, because that door isn't very wide. Maybe 8ft wide and 9-10ft tall, unless the OP is standing on a tall step ladder to get this pic.  I would prefer to see ratchet straps, and padding on hard edges, if I had to leave the doorway occupied. Otherwise, I would red tape the kill zone while I was working on it."

OSHA,39chki,sparks277,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"The confusing thing is, this is typically false for non-residential wiring. When you are wiring electronics, typically red is positive/hot and black is neutral/ground. Sometimes you'll end up with a case where yellow is +5V and red is +12V."
OSHA,39chki,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:20:02 2015 UTC,If it was for.am exauhst fan where is the neutral? ??
OSHA,39chki,uberbob102000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:46 2015 UTC,Hard to tell from this pic what's going on. I'm guessing it's something that's been abandon. The only way it could be working otherwise is if the pipe is acting as the neutral.
OSHA,39chki,lookatthatsquirrel,4,Sat Jun 20 01:44:04 2015 UTC,Just 240 doesn't always need a neutral unless there is some controller that needs it.
OSHA,39chki,uberbob102000,0,Wed Jun 10 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"While you're correct, the 120V load DOES need a neutral, as it's only using one leg of 240V split phase system.   So some jackass thought ""Instead of pulling a neutral, I'll just bond to Earth ground as the neutral return path"". This is a terrible idea in about every way possible."
OSHA,39b8kc,AdmiralBuzKillington,16,Wed Jun 10 16:10:08 2015 UTC,That's just a really expensive car hoist.
OSHA,39b8kc,deeferg,9,Wed Jun 10 20:11:36 2015 UTC,I actually use our forklift to change my tires. As far as crouching underneath it? Well that's the real problem here.
OSHA,39b8kc,utopiarywindow,23,Wed Jun 10 20:46:55 2015 UTC,It's pretty safe I'd say.
OSHA,39b8kc,angryratman,20,Wed Jun 10 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, shitty old forklifts never experience sudden hydraulic failure."
OSHA,39b8kc,Canadian_Infidel,8,Wed Jun 10 20:24:47 2015 UTC,how do you know its not fully serviced?
OSHA,39b8kc,angryratman,16,Wed Jun 10 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fully serviced forklifts never experience sudden hydraulic failure.  The only time I've had a hose break personally: I was driving a forklift that was in great condition and looked at by mechanics regularly. The hose just burst in the middle. Fortunately I was going straight on concrete on a flat surface with nobody around, because the bonus was all the oil went in my face so I suddenly couldn't see anything. Yay for safety glasses.  Edit: splling"
OSHA,39b8kc,Canadian_Infidel,4,Wed Jun 10 22:21:56 2015 UTC,Be glad that it's not pneumatic.
OSHA,39b8kc,thrakkerzog,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think they make pneumatic forklifts, and I'd rather have a or in my face then Hydrolic fluid"
OSHA,39b8kc,PushinDonuts,2,Thu Jun 11 01:16:23 2015 UTC,Yeah pneumatics aren't capable of that I don't think.
OSHA,39b8kc,Canadian_Infidel,2,Thu Jun 11 03:16:01 2015 UTC,Hydraulic fluid releases a lot slower than air. You'd at least have a chance at escaping if the hydraulics gave out.
OSHA,39b8kc,thrakkerzog,2,Thu Jun 11 05:38:52 2015 UTC,Honestly though... proper car hoist can fail just as easy...
OSHA,39b8kc,AbsoluteZeroK,5,Thu Jun 11 04:14:06 2015 UTC,But a proper hoist has safety locks that will hold it up when the hydraulics fail.
OSHA,39b8kc,demiknute,3,Thu Jun 11 11:28:45 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'm not a mechanic...
OSHA,39b8kc,AbsoluteZeroK,5,Thu Jun 11 18:45:30 2015 UTC,Would you get under it?
OSHA,39b8kc,stiv2k,7,Wed Jun 10 20:14:07 2015 UTC,Yes
OSHA,39b8kc,LazyTheSloth,2,Thu Jun 11 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"""Probably"" safe I'd say."
OSHA,39b8kc,Red_Apple_Cigs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:22:12 2015 UTC,as safe as a hoist.
OSHA,39b8kc,kidneyshifter,7,Thu Jun 11 10:53:49 2015 UTC,What an idiot.

OSHA,39b8kc,Broduski,2,Wed Jun 10 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"My uncle lost the jack to his T-100 pickup, so he just lifts it up with his backhoe to change the tires."
OSHA,39b8kc,bjacks12,2,Thu Jun 11 19:46:53 2015 UTC,This is why Toyota are a bunch of fucking idiots for putting the engine in the middle of a mini van.
OSHA,39b8kc,iamjomos,11,Wed Jun 10 21:02:29 2015 UTC,Toyota foresaw people using forklifts to lift minivans for maintenance? That's impressive.
OSHA,39b8kc,Davegarski,3,Thu Jun 11 02:26:36 2015 UTC,"You mean that mid-engined, rear wheel drive supercar!!!"
OSHA,39b8kc,kidneyshifter,2,Thu Jun 11 10:54:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he's working on the transmission or some other part of the drivetrain and not the engine because that's not where the engine's located in minivans.  Edit: I stand corrected. That's a Toyota Previa and it is indeed a mid-engined minivan.
OSHA,39b8kc,spurious_interrupt,2,Thu Jun 11 10:22:50 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Previa
OSHA,39b8kc,bjacks12,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Toyota Previa:       The Toyota Previa, also known as the Toyota Estima (エスティマ) in Japan, Toyota Canarado in the Asia Pacific, and Toyota Tarago in Australia, is an MPV or multi-purpose vehicle (known as a minivan in North America) produced by Toyota since 1990. The name ""Previa"" is derived from the Spanish and Italian for ""preview,"" as Toyota saw the first Previa as a vehicle that would preview technologies used in future minivans. Along with the Toyota Sienna, the Previa is the second largest minivan in Toyota's line-up after the bigger and more luxurious Alphard/Vellfire (which is not offered in most Western markets).

OSHA,39b8kc,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:46:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you should do some research
OSHA,39b8kc,iamjomos,2,Thu Jun 11 14:52:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, I stand corrected. Wow, that is really stupid."
OSHA,39b8kc,spurious_interrupt,2,Fri Jun 12 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yea lol. They wanted good weight balance, but forgot about the part where they couldn't add a bigger engine (like they needed to add a v6 to compete but were forced to supercharge the 4)"
