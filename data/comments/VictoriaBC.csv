VictoriaBC,3e3feh,VelvetJustice,24,Tue Jul 21 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"The whole system is messed up. It's no surprise that the few medical students who are graduating in BC have little interest in becoming a GP with their own office. My father is a GP, he switched from working in hospitals about 28 years ago to start his own practice when he realized he needed more time for his family ('more' time isn't quite the right wording, just having more set work hours, Monday-Friday). He had to purchase his practice (yes, with his own money and now when he retires in 5 years won't be able to sell for a penny.) The system was bad then, but it hasn't improved. He has always left home before 8 am, and returns home after 6pm every night. His office hours are 9-5. He spends the first and last hour doing paper work (which he is not paid for), and often spends the majority of his hour lunch break doing paper work. This includes filling out forms that must be filled out by the doctor for patients which each require ridiculous questions to be answered.   He employs a secretary full time. He must pay for his office space, all his computers, offices supplies, etc. A portion of his billing for patients seen in office do go towards covering his overhead, however if he does a house-call, or has to see a patient in the hospital MSP does not include the added fee for his overhead. Locums used to be much easier to find if he wanted to take vacation or needed to be away from the office for a period of time. They are becoming extremely hard to get, as many of them choose to cover doctors in walk-in clinics, where they can make more money by seeing more patients (clinics are structured differently, and allow for a higher flow, however, at the cost of seeing a new doctor every time, and without your medical history being accessible). When he does have a locum covering him, he is still paying his overhead (unlike regular jobs where people have vacation pay, he loses money by taking time off).   Many new graduates are opting to work in hospitals. They do not have overhead to pay there, they can take vacation much easier, the shifts are better now, and there is less time doing paper work due to the nature of their jobs. There's really no surprise that new doctors would chose to do this. GPs are paid very poorly for the work they do. Keep in mind they are the first step for diagnosis for the majority of illnesses, and continue to monitor your health throughout your illness as you go through specialists, surgeries, etc. GPs are helping you with your health issues from birth to death, they keep people out of emergency, and do a great deal to keep our population as healthy as possible. Your doctor may have just told someone they have cancer before seeing you, and they are still expected to come into the room and treat you without having their emotions from the day affect them. All of this and the government is still shitting on them, cutting funding where ever possible, not aiding medical students in the studies, and making the very thought of becoming a GP with their own practice un-appealing.   Edit: formatting"
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,Zheoy,5,Tue Jul 21 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"I wish I could upvote you more than once since you actually understand what's going on. I know several physicians myself, and they have described much the same scenario to me.  The new graduates are - like you wrote - not interested in opening up a practice, for the exact reasons you outlined. They don't want to pay all that overhead and shoulder the responsibility of looking after the long-term care of individual patients (especially ones with complex medical issues). They prefer to either work in hospitals or as locums because they don't have any of that overhead or responsibility to worry about.  Whereas once an established practice was worth a pretty penny, nowadays a retiring doctor can't give their practice away. And a lot of retiring doctors factored in the profit from selling their practices into their retirement plans. This means that there's a lot of older doctors who are short a significant amount of cash for their retirement and who now can't afford to retire. Older, retiring doctors can find themselves in a very unenviable financial position.   The problem is with the manner that the government handles physicians in this province. They are given absolutely zero incentives to open family practices. Until that changes, the ""shortage"" will continue."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,ignore_my_typo,10,Tue Jul 21 23:33:06 2015 UTC,"But the model is the same for practically EVERY business out there, medical or not.   I went to school for 3 years for Graphic Design. Now I could make $75k being an art director at a firm, working for someone else or I could start my own company and work long hours, no holidays, pay staff and rent a brick and mortar store front.   Yes there are problems and we need to get it fixed, but it really isn't any different than opening a store front. We need to change the model in this country. Opening up practices in a hospital might be one way. This way you have a whole multitude of physicians who can rotate.   I truly believe with the way technology and recording keeping has changed and the amount of patients a GP has, keeping the same Dr for your lifetime isn't needed. Most people are fine seeing any MD as long as they have access to one."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,Zheoy,10,Wed Jul 22 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"The difference between opening a practice as a GP and opening your own business is that as a business owner you can change your prices to reflect overhead costs (employees, rent/ mortgages, etc.) to however much the economy will handle. Doctors cannot - they are on a fee schedule which is controlled by MSP (the provincial government). Doctors should not have to take the financial risks of business owner to run their practice on a universal health care system.   The major problem with not having care through one or two GPs throughout your life is that your health records are not accessible between clinics or sometimes even between doctors. The government expects doctors to pay and manage their own patient charts, and with strict (however, fair and needed) privacy laws surrounding access to patient information makes this prohibitive. This will directly affect a patient's care if they are never seeing the same doctor who has access to their patient charts.   Here's an example: you see Dr. X Friday for an infection- they prescribe you an antibiotic and send you on your way. 2 weeks later once you've run the course, you find it hasn't worked. Today, you're seeing Dr. Y, and you've forgotten your prescription bottle at home. You have no idea what the last doctor prescribed you, or even exactly what they thought your infection was. Dr. Y now has to essentially re diagnose you, with none of your past information.   Now, that's a simple example. Imagine if this was a much more complicated and serious case - the patient has had cancer surgeries and treatment. Every time they have to follow up they see a new doctor.   Having one GP who has invested their time into your case is far more beneficial than having multiple doctors who cannot access your entire medical history. As the population gets older having care from one doctor becomes vital: they often require house calls if they are unable to travel. Older patients may forget what medication they are on when it comes time for a refill on their prescription. Having multiple doctors as a young healthy person is an entirely different story than it is for much of the population who rely heavily on their one GP."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,ignore_my_typo,9,Wed Jul 22 04:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, fair enough, but as I said, the model needs to change.   How many single doctor offices do you encounter anymore? Hardly any. Most have multiple doctors sharing office space and equipment reducing overhead costs.   One of the problems I have experienced and heard is that many family doctors don't work 5 days and opt to only do a couple a week. This doesn't help the problem at all.  Thanks for your response."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,ManofManyTalentz,12,Wed Jul 22 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! Here I am, a Canadian citizen who went to medical school abroad. I wanted to practice in Canada but guess what? No graduate residency positions. Like a dummy I applied multiple times here and nothing. I specifically want to be a GP, just like the majority of new doctors do now too. Zilch. Applied in the USA and guess what? It breaks my heart that my home country doesn't want me simply because I wasn't blessed by the CMA.   Things will not change until people call up their MPs and MPPs and demand more residency positions, not medical school spots."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,nrtphotos,11,Wed Jul 22 01:08:46 2015 UTC,it's bad enough if you are a healthy person trying to find a doctor. have health issues or mental health problems? you're basically fucked.
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,Dual45,4,Wed Jul 22 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"The province needs to allow Nurse Practitioners to participate in the MSP rather than demand they work under the Health Authorities, these are the primary care providers of the future alongside physicians"
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,f-a-p,3,Tue Jul 21 20:37:41 2015 UTC,"We need more spaces - way more spaces - in medical schools. It seems to me that there are 1,000's of qualified applicants being rejected annually from medical schools, not because they lack the skills, grades, etc, but simply because there aren't the spaces available.   We should invest more in post-secondary med schools, so that in 5 to 10 yrs, we'll have this shortage sorted out."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,blizzard13,7,Tue Jul 21 18:47:56 2015 UTC,It is unfortunate we did not know this 5 - 10 years ago and this would be sorted....oh wait we did....and we did nothing.  In all seriousness does anyone know why we don't up the number of spots in medical schools?  I find it hard to believe it is just a money thing.
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,thelawnranger,7,Tue Jul 21 18:53:33 2015 UTC,When my last doctor retired more than 15 years ago he told me unless I become pregnant or turn into a small child I was unlikely to find a replacement GP any time soon. I'm still doctor free.
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,Tal-IGN,5,Tue Jul 21 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yet there have also been many news stories about recently graduated specialist physicians who can't find work in their field.  You could use similar logic to extrapolate that we're graduating too many doctors, and need to cut back med school enrollment.  Obviously that's not true, but my point is that the problem is more complicated than just not enough doctors being graduated.  The problem is not a big enough proportion of med school students want to be GP's.  It's not a sexy specialty.  Just adding way more spaces to medical schools alone is not gonna solve everything.  There needs to be more incentives pushing students into being family doctors instead of pursuing other specialties."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,dubbreak,4,Tue Jul 21 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"There needs to be more incentives pushing students into being family doctors instead of pursuing other specialties.   While I agree that it's an issue of too many med students selecting specialities over GP there is one motivating factor: money.  GPs don't make enough relative to specialists (when education time and cost is taken into consideration). ""Sexy"" has nothing to do with it, it's simple economics. Why not do a little more school in order to increase your earning potential double, triple or more? Seems like a no brainer (well.. until there are too many specialists, though with wait times in Victoria I find it difficult to believe we suffer from that locally)."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,f-a-p,4,Tue Jul 21 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are something like 4 cardiologists, and 7 gerontologists serving the capital region. Where / and what specialties are over-serviced? This is news to me."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,Tal-IGN,3,Tue Jul 21 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"http://www.vancouversun.com/business/medical+specialists+struggle+find+work/9018859/story.html  I'm not sure what the numbers would be for Victoria specifically, but those are some numbers for BC.  I don't think it's a matter of specialties being over-serviced, it's a matter of there not being enough budget/time/facilities for multiple surgeons of a certain specialty to have time in the OR for example."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,dubbreak,4,Tue Jul 21 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"Specialists having a difficult time finding jobs is probably not a case of there being too many specialists but rather them being particular about where they want to work. Just a guess, nothing to back that up.  Could also be budget. I had to wait 6 months for an orthopaedic surgery.. or rather was told 6 months, had it schedule at the 6 month point then weeks before the surgery had complications which resulted in an emergency surgery (multiple procedures instead of one). Had the surgery been more timely I wouldn't have needed multiple procedures or the emergency surgery. Busy surgeons, full operating room slates.. it's tough to get a break when you are young and healthy and still working (i.e. low priority). Original surgery was a simple 45 minute procedure (or less), delaying ended up costing a lot more and meant a much longer recovery for me.  I'm grateful I won't go bankrupt from medical expenses, but our system is slow. One of my friends in the US had his choice of dates for a gallbladder removal.  ""What day next week works best for you sir?""  He even cancelled once when he had to take a business trip, and they just rescheduled it asap. No back of the list or anything like that."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,ManofManyTalentz,5,Tue Jul 21 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"WRONG - 100% wrong. We have plenty of medical school spots in Canada. the problem is medical residency: this is governed between the federal government in terms of money, run by the universities, and lobbied on by the Canadian Medical Association. If you want to increase the number of doctors, it's not medical schools: call them to open more residency positions."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,ehManiacal,3,Wed Jul 22 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"I know someone who's helped to put one of his children through medical school, they found a less expensive school on some Caribbean island that was (apparently) better equipped and had a shorter waiting list than Canadian ones, then after that was done there was a school in the USA followed by residency... also in USA.   I don't know all of the details but it's not really helping Canadians if it's more appealing to go to the Caribbean and USA to get med school done."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,moosepile,3,Wed Jul 22 06:12:27 2015 UTC,"We moved to (greater-ish) Victoria eight years ago, family of five. Still no ""family doctor"" when asked at the walk-in.  Spots do seem to open up, but we've never stumbled across a doctor accepting patients that wasn't downtown or far away."
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,dexx4d,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"I usually respond to the question ""Do you have a family doctor?"" with ""Are any of your doctors taking new patients?"""
VictoriaBC,3e3feh,MrYYJ,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"Our family doctor retired last month. He was 78 (I'm in my forties and he delivered me here at Royal Jubilee). My parents, now in their 70's as well, had worried for years what would happen if he retired. Luckily he was able to hand over the practice to two doctors. What motivated him more than anything else was to ensure that the receptionist, a very valuable part of the practice in her own right, would have a job. She has another 10 years or so to go before she can retire.  He also retired quite suddenly after tying up all the loose ends and making sure everyone was taken care of, presumably to avoid ""the long good-bye"" as all of his patients stopped by to say good bye.  He's a great, great man. A true mensch. I will miss him."
VictoriaBC,3e51ti,RocketSpooge,14,Wed Jul 22 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"The terms of any agreement between the landlord and tenant only apply to the property owned by the landlord.  If there are parking restrictions imposed by a separate by-law, that is a matter that involves the city or town that imposed and enforces that by-law, not the landlord.  All parking restrictions on public roads and streets are required to be marked with signs, curb painting, or painted markings on the road surface. But even if painted, it still needs to have signs because snow, ice, and hail, could obscure the marked pavement.  Put a line through that section of the terms, initial it, and ask the landlord to do the same. It's bullshit.   EDIT: I've been a landlord for two multi-unit buildings in Ontario for many years, and I've had to deal with a lot of parking issues. Sure, you can't park a car with no plates on the street, of do an engine rebuild, or leave a car parked for certain amounts of time. But you can definitely have friends over, or even park your own vehicles on the street if you obey the signs and city regulations."
VictoriaBC,3e51ti,Todd66,9,Wed Jul 22 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"The only instance I can think of where a landlord can control street parking in BC is a residential strata planned community. Similar to a condo building in newer neighbourhoods and developments, very common in the West Shore, Gordon Head, Broadmead, and behind the General Hospital are these strata plans for single and multifamily family houses. In this case the common area of the strata plan is the roadway (and occasionally driveways and front lawns), similar to the hallways of a condo building. These common areas are controlled, maintained and governed by the strata association of the particular development and are not public streets although they appear identical to a standard roadway (occasionally they will have a decorative sign in place of a municipal one or interlocking brick in place of asphalt roads). In this type of case, the strata could have rules pertaining to how many cars can be outside of a single unit (each house in this case) weather they are in the driveway or on the street.  In a case such as this a homeowner of a strata titled house with a rental suite in it or someone whom is permitted by the strata to rent a whole home is required to pass on all the rules of the strata to their tenant(s). If found breaking the rules of the strata the owners can be assessed penalties from fines to a court ordered sale of their property. AKA in an instance such as this it may be out of the landlords hands.  I have been in property rentals in BC for over a decade and this is the only case I can think of from my studies for the management licensing process in which any homeowner can control the roadway in front of their home."
VictoriaBC,3e51ti,ejmears,4,Wed Jul 22 02:28:48 2015 UTC,The landlord can't really say shit about the public street.
VictoriaBC,3e51ti,Great68,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"Can you even fit more than 3 cars at the place, including the road? The road in front of the place can hold maybe 2 cars? Doesn't say anything about parking on the road at the neighbours house...  My bet is they don't want you parking cars on the lawn or cramming them in the driveway.  The bylaw certainly doesn't limit you, but I know little about what crazy things can be written into a tenancy agreement."

The phone call yielded $10,000 savings (per year) for the client. Telus has no motivation to notify their customers of rate changes.  Cell phone incumbents, ISPs, and even waste disposal have identical practices."

I was under the impression I'd be grandfathered. What exactly do they change since they don't even offer that service anymore?
VictoriaBC,3e0i3m,gullington,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"You will be rate increased along with everyone else.

We'll see what happens with the rate increase and when it is up later this year, we'll probably end up having to go for the 120, we're not paying the same price for almost half the fucking speed (60 plan is $90 iirc...)."

Aside from not giving you the courtesy of informing you they've done nothing wrong. In fact, they can't just switch you over to that new plan.     As for Telus, we've been with them for ~3 years now and haven't a single issue whatsoever so I do recommend them. But guess what? They'll do the exact same thing that Shaw did. If you do switch to Telus make sure you setup everything over the phone/online and do not go into one of their stores for account creation. I can't stress this enough."
VictoriaBC,3e0i3m,XavierWoodshed,2,Tue Jul 21 06:09:18 2015 UTC,do not go into one of their stores for account creation. I can't stress this enough.   Curious - why not?
VictoriaBC,3e0i3m,nicktheviking27,4,Tue Jul 21 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"This comes from personal experience and from what I've heard from other customers, CS agents, and couple Telus installers. The Tl;dr is that in-store there was next to no care for the customer outside of making the sale. My experience:     Salesman told us that the Telus PVR was not available anywhere but in their stores. Fact was it was on sale for $75 at FS and they wanted $200 for it. We were promised a number of ""rebates"". Only one of the rebates existed and it didn't apply to us. The other two didn't exist. He set us up with two install appointments. Neither of which matched the date/time he told us. He told we had a package included with our TV for free for a year. It was actually 30 days.   Yes, this was all in writing. That being said, Telus CS was beyond helpful. They were able to get us one of the rebates, the TV package, and offset the cost of the PVR. As for the rest they said I'd have to get the sales rep I deal with to fix it. I could not for the life of me get anyone at that store to help. That sales rep was magically never working whenever I called or went in. Eventually I gave all that information to Customer care and they set everything straight. This was the Hillside Mall location."

I'm on Internet 25 which I understood to be what they recommended as a decent speed to run Netflix reliably. I asked if there was anything comparable at a better price and the rep told me for $3 more could upgrade to Internet 30. Uh, not what I asked. Pretty much called it there and stuck with my service.    For what it's worth, if they increased my bill by any amount, even $1, without my permission, as you seem to suggest you would have liked...

I recently had a similar thing happen to me with my cellphone plan with Bell. Thankfully I was able to change my service to a better plan for a much cheaper price. Basically if you are on a contract that is about to run out or if you are getting some service without a contract but you haven't checked the alternatives for years, it is a good idea to set aside some time and explore the current options out on the market. All businesses rely on customers foolishly paying them more money than they need to."

It seems so strange that little kids could die in hotel rooms and despite great efforts to save her life, everyone would just head back to the station for the next call. At the very least, the mother was clearly in distress, not in a long term sort of housing situation, possibly not near her support network (if from out of town) and responsible for another young and vulnerable child.

VictoriaBC,3dyu2b,maxhubris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:48 2015 UTC,Edit:  There's no one answer.   You'll have to try different styles and teachers.  Apparently I like floofy yoga. :)  Moksana is a great space.  I'd recommend buying a 1 month pass and checking out the different styles and teachers.

Funnily enough I am also a 28 yr/old guy looking to improve my flexibility and looking to get back into yoga (I haven't found any that work with my schedule yet though :\ )  That being said Meagan @ Bikram Yoga Saanich, has an intro to flow yoga course next weekend, and lessons following it, if it works with your schedule.  I used to go to hers when she was out in deep cove, and they were awesome.  Flow yoga (or at least hers) I found was a bit more well rounded for all around flexibility than Bikram (hot yoga) where it's the same series of poses every time. (some of the other kinds of yoga are more floofy relaxation meditation, which I don't really gather is what you're looking for?)  If you search ""Intro to Vinyasa Flow Workshop Weekend and Class Series"" on facebook it will come up (it won't let me post a link)"
VictoriaBC,3dyu2b,stevo911_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"Any studio is going to have some classes that are good for beginners. They're all trying to recruit new students. If I were you I'd avoid classes that are vinyasa or flow. In these type of classes one posture flows into the next without a pause in between and personally I find that makes it harder to learn them. I really like hot yoga, the heat adds a challenging and enjoyable dimension,  it's definitely worth trying. I'd recommend against bikrams for a lot of reasons, I found moksha to be a much better hot option (just try to avoid the strictly flow classes)."

VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,wfc2566,15,Mon Jul 20 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the waterfall, though  mystic would be awesome either way.  Wouldn't recommend hiking the tail in the dark.   Maybe camp there?  I have yet to be there when it was overly busy.     There will be some people around but there has always been lots of space."
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,kbunkis,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"I second camping (if OP has the gear).  Last time I was there in the summer it was busy-ish midday ( under 20 people total?), but by dinner pretty much everyone was gone. We were solo until some hikers came through to spend the night as well.   Of course said hikers elected to stay within 20 ft from us. We could have moved, but it seemed pretty strange they would choose to be right beside us when there was so much beach and no other campers (some international students doing the Juan de Fuca trail).  Anyhow, it's a pretty big beach for the number of people that go down there. You could have dozens of tents and not be on top of each other (unless someone is really insistent on camping on top of you). Waterfall or not it's beautiful."
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,dubbreak,13,Mon Jul 20 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"You don't want to hike back at night.   Why don't you bring stuff out to camp the night?   You'll see the sunset, have the beach mostly to yourselves in an incredibly romantic location..  THEN pop the question, and enjoy snuggling in a tent the night.   Watch the sunrise together in the morning, and make her a super special camp breakfast.    Combine a really wonderful experience with the proposal, instead of just doing it at a nice place.   Adding an experience makes it all that more special and memorable.   It would make a nice romantic story, too!"
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,mactac,-2,Mon Jul 20 05:53:51 2015 UTC,I read this in a book once.
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,witty_remark,11,Mon Jul 20 06:34:08 2015 UTC,Lots of people there especially this time of year. It shares a parking lot with China beach (which is just as nice imo and just a short walk down) and there are lots of people there too. There is also a campground at China. Mystic is worth the trek down because its a cool hike down. Stop at Shirley Delicious for a bite on the way!
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,jbarbs8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"much better trail, very doable with a headlamp in the dark"
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,matth3wm,8,Tue Jul 21 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"Went there about a week ago, waterfall is still in operation. As for hiking back, there are loads of tree roots just dying to trip you up, flashlights are a must."
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,hkdalek,4,Mon Jul 20 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Mystic doesn't get a lot of overnight campers, mostly because hikers are passing through on their first or last day. Midweek you might have the place all to yourselves.  It's a bit of a walk there and back. And yes, def. take lights if you do it in the dark."
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,bkplant,3,Mon Jul 20 03:39:43 2015 UTC,You have to plan your trip to Mystic Beach based on the tides for that day as well. There is very little point heading down there at high tide because there is not much room to walk along the beach that way. Check the tides online for Mystic Beach and try and plan to head over at low tide. You can walk the entire beach that way and you will have a wicked experience.
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,PenlessEJ,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"A better idea for this sort of thing would be to go to Botanical Beach at Port Renfrew. It's about 30 minutes past Mystic/China.  The trail down to Botany Bay is a quick walk down from the car park, and it would be easier to navigate in the dark / dusk.  The cove at Botany Bay looks out at the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula and the open Pacific Ocean. Depending on the tide, you can walk right out to the reef and you'll have a reasonable amount of privacy too, compared to Mystic, which is actually pretty crowded at this time of year.  I have actually hiked the trail down to Mystic in the dark. I can't recommend it, although I did end up camping on the beach. This was before it was park, though. But the hike is a long one.  The trail down to Botany Bay at Botanical is straight, wide and short."
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,MrYYJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:00 2015 UTC,"Mystic beach is awesome. China beach is also super nice, pretty secluded little bay at the end of a not too long or difficult hike (1.5km I think)"
VictoriaBC,3dw7ls,NorthSuperior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"Best beach and waterfall by far is the hidden one at Sombrio beach on the east side. The trail down is easy and short. The sunset will be stunning there. It's in a canyon like area.   Go to youtube.com and search for ""discoversooke""   They have a video of it somewhere. I believe it is one of the TSN commercial videos."

VictoriaBC,3dvru9,All_bugs_in_amber,13,Sun Jul 19 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"Two kids, both in that age range, checking in.  Our favourite place to take the kids is actually Pizzaria Prima Strada in Cook Street Village.  I know this sounds weird, but stick with me.  Go before the rush - say 11:30 or 5:30, ish.  High Chairs, colouring, all that jazz.  You'll be seated before the rush and the food is BLAZING fast.  Seriously, you'll order a pizza and it'll be at your table within 4 or 5 minutes.  Appys are even faster.  You'll be in before the rush, so the big bar along the open kitchen and wood-fired oven will be empty.  The kids can sit in the tall stools and watch their food get made.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat with the kids if they're not too busy.  They have a huge variety of pies, and my kids eat anything we get except for the most spicy.  Meatballs are a good kid-friendly appy if they don't mind a little spice.  Get Gelato for dessert.  Cook Street playground (near Dallas Road) is about as fun as they get in the city and just up the road.  Work up an appetite or play off the pizza.  There is another location up near Bridge Street, too, but I actually have never been to that one.  The owners have kids, so they know how to make good food that's actually surprisingly family friendly.  Alternatively, Red Fish Blue Fish isn't bad, but it's a bit of a stressful lunch for me.  A long wait, although there's lot of room for the kids to wander if they're attended to.  Eating is again a little dicey on stools, but it's not a big deal if they drop a fry because the seagulls are there for cleanup duty.  Avoid peak times like the plague this time of year; it's a zoo and probably a 1 hour wait.  You can do so much better than Red Robins, Denny's, Boston Pizza..."

VictoriaBC,3dt3ex,Bitter_Bert,7,Sun Jul 19 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"The parking lot up top fills up fast, so you should be there when they open the gate for a shot at parking otherwise there's quite a few steps from the lower parking lot to the observatory.  There are often a bunch of solar scopes setup to watch the setting sun, although the sun is pretty dull to look at currently with almost no visible activity.  They also will do tours of the big telescope there, and there's a bit of wandering opportunity around the area.  If you have impatient ppl with you, take a snack and a blanket and have a picnic, as there are some great views of the lower peninsula."

VictoriaBC,3dt3ex,3uphony,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"I went last night at 8:30.  The guard said the top had filled up at 6pm.  They will not let you park anywhere and walk up, because they are concerned about people getting hit once it is dark, and the off road path is a pretty steep climb during the day.  At night it would be deadly.     We were very nice to guard at the lower gate, and he let us and a handful of others wait until someone else came down, and we were able to get in after about 20 minutes.  But I would not count on that.  A much less friendly guard showed up shorty after and was turning people away.    Even after the sun goes down, they have to wait for the telescope to cool down and the sky to completely darken.  They turned it on around 9:30 last night, and then had to calibrate for quite some time.    But it is really cool to see the telescope operate.  The people are all volunteers and are quite knowledgeable and friendly."

They have shade tents set up, and many other places round to find some, but nowhere near enough for everyone until around 6pm  How was it without a contained beer garden? Fantastic! This is how it should be done!   Was it total mayhem after the closing band?

My husband and I have a membership for about $120 a year (I think it's less for one person), and it just gives me some peace of mind. I don't have to worry about figuring out the nearest towing company or rates or anything. Bonus: the membership also includes cycling assistance, so if something happens halfway through your ride and you can't fix your bike to get back, they'll help you out.  You may not want/need it, but I thought I'd just throw that out there."

VictoriaBC,3ds553,slothjizz,3,Sun Jul 19 00:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I highly recommend getting the ""Roadside Plus"" coverage through ICBC (if you qualify), especially for those who don't have a BCAA membership or dealership coverage.  Doesn't cost much, like you said, (cheaper than BCAA membership) and you get tow truck coverage/battery boost/flat fixing, plus it makes your regular car insurance automatically apply to rental cars if you're travelling (really handy if you travel/rent cars a lot) as well as lock rekeying/key replacement for lost keys, and a bunch of other stuff.  There's really no reason NOT to get this coverage, people!  It basically pays for itself after, like, the first time you rent a car on vacation and don't need to get insurance for it.  The roadside assistance stuff is basically a huge bonus."
VictoriaBC,3ds553,MommaDerp,3,Sun Jul 19 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely looking into it next week, I had no idea it was something ICBC offered! It'll be especially useful once my manufacturer's roadside assistance expires, too."

This is no longer the case. The staff either came into Kal Tire perametres and values or they were let go.   If you're not sure about the reality of what they're telling you, try asking for a timeline about when work absolutely needs to be done. Often they will bring issues to your attention that you can ignore for 12+ months, but it will eventually be a problem. You want to ask questions of anyone looking at any of your property.

VictoriaBC,3dqbt7,TechnicallyITsCoffee,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:45 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people would think that an amalgated Greater Victoria would somehow be more democratic.  Amalgamation means less democracy. I would also rather see the frankly undemcratic CRD reformed first.  The attempt at a power play against Esquimalt to force 3 sewage treatment plant facilities on the township demonstrates why amalgamation is a good idea.   The only thing that saved Esquimalt is that council was able to firmly prevent the treatment plants from being forced on the community.
VictoriaBC,3dqbt7,MrYYJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:02 2015 UTC,Wow. Did they literally not invite the mayors of two municipalities to a meeting discussing merging with said municipalities?  That takes some damned chutzpah.
VictoriaBC,3dqbt7,Palpz,3,Sat Jul 18 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Well, Oak Bay, at least, had the highest opposition to amalgamation in the 2014 ballot question. Their participation at this point could well just be counterproductive, and making amalgamation happen would ultimately be up to the province anyway, so as a practical matter it makes perfect sense to leave them out."
VictoriaBC,3dqbt7,dentonite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:25:30 2015 UTC,Can't blame them. Highest property prices in the region leads me to suspect that the other current municipalities in the area would treat Oak Bay as a cash cow post amalgamation. They're not very likely to come out of it ahead.
VictoriaBC,3dqbt7,Palpz,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:34:28 2015 UTC,No to this amalgamation nonsense.  Each municipality should have its own rules.

Maybe a little overused these days, but little harm in that. I know I default to it.  I think Massimo Vignelli was right with his 5 essential typefaces. All you need are a few basic ones. His 5 were:   Helvetica Century Times New Roman Futura Bodini   ""DESIGN IS ONE: LELLA & MASSIMO VIGNELLI"" is on Netflix, and if you are even marginally into design (modern) it's well worth the watch. They are an interesting couple and their design aesthetic is pretty amazing."

Government street cries out to be pedestrian only, with businesses licensed to extend their operations into the street. Restaurant tables, cafe tables, store displays, you name it. It would be awesome.  Ever been to a city square in Amsterdam?  In the winter the whole damn thing will be tented with heaters, packed to the nuts with people. It's awesome!  They could still open the street to cars until noon for deliveries and such.  Anyone who thinks that business will dip if people can't drive up government are on crack."

Look around at other online ads for similar cars in similar condition to get an idea of what you should be asking for it. There are other things that have totally put me off even contacting a seller about a car, such as a lack of insurance for a test drive, dead battery, if the ad says something like, ""runs and drives but has a few issues,"" or ""good car to get you from A to B.""

VictoriaBC,3dpdj7,TechnicallyITsCoffee,2,Sat Jul 18 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"That's definitely it. You're selling a car 8 years older than mine, with 30,000 more Km on it, for almost 3X the price of mine.  These days you can buy a new, off-the-lot Fiat 300 starting at $16k.  Yes it is a Toyota, and yes it should live to 1/4 million Km, but not without investing.  Parts start needing replacement right around 150Km on those.  Early 90's Corolla's and Camry's like to start burning a lot of oil later in life too.  You might be able to get a little more if you're patient, but I wouldn't pay more than $1,000 for it.  That's assuming there's no wobble at higher speeds and braking, front end is tight and aligned, no smoke, etc...  I get that you priced comparable to other cars of similar year/Km, unfortunately they are either on used car lots -notorious for unreasonable mark-ups- or they're simply doing the same as you and grossly over-estimating their vehicles ability to sell."

It turns into a mini bidding war where the seller picks the final price.

Add $1000 on a low km vehicle. ($3500 on a new vehicle)  Double everything because it is in a lot makes $10,000.  Would I  pay that for a 1994 4-Runner? FUCK NO."

Finding a $500 car that runs is a pretty good deal these days.  If you want something that will end up being reliable unless you get super lucky, you're looking at 1200-1500 minimum"
VictoriaBC,3dik7a,rachael_bee,0,Thu Jul 16 21:11:47 2015 UTC,Our budget is $2500.
VictoriaBC,3dik7a,dubbreak,3,Thu Jul 16 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"And what's your yearly budget for maintenance?   In that price range I'd go small and either Toyota or Honda (leaning towards Toyota, since Honda/Acura tend to get money put towards aftermarket parts but no maintenance.. in general I'd avoid anything owned by someone young as oil changes often get put off in favour of other things....).   Early 90s stuff is really easy to wrench on yourself and parts are cheap. I had a 1992 Accord 2dr. Great car (good power, comfortable) plus it was cheap and easy to maintain. Wife (gf at the time) had a 90 Corolla, same deal. Cheap and easy. Tercels seem to go forever and are not very popular. Neighbour has a mid 90s example with the usual paint peel and fade. Never had a problem with it. Worth very little, so they'll probably just run it into the ground. Paseo is a reliable yet unpopular car.  The biggest benefit of small Japanese cars are consumables are cheap. Brake rotors for $30/piece (cheaper than machining), pads are dirt cheap, they don't take much oil (i.e. oil changes are cheap), small tires are cheap ($60/tire for 13"" or 14"" tires... my truck just cost me >$250 a tire out the door).  Stay away from 99-01 Hondas that are auto. Bad transmissions those years (Civic, Accord, Odyssey). Out of your price range, but if you are thinking of spending more for a more reliable vehicle, skip those."

I won't need it inspected until I bring it to the shop to see what we're looking at price wise. If it's more than $2000, I'll just toss it. for $500, I won't be affected really.  If it comes ready to go, no fix ups, I will pay $2500 for it. But I will get it inspected and I will need to test drive it.   I just want a car, but apparently victoria is unreasonable.

VictoriaBC,3dik7a,mrtherapist,7,Thu Jul 16 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am one of the only people that thinks breeding purebred animals is unethical. The animals are inbred so far to get a genetic trait that they have tons of health problems.  Take pugs for example. http://www.pugvillage.com/pug-health/pug-genetic-issues  There are whole databases that outline the health problems. http://ic.upei.ca/cidd/breeds/overview  Instead of letting a bit of cross breeding happen, breeders are required to keep ""the bloodlines pure."" There are ways to mitigate genetic problems as a breeder, but for most purebred animals it is going to be too little too late in regards to health.  The ethical issue is not in the buying and selling of the animal for me."
VictoriaBC,3dik7a,stevo911_,5,Thu Jul 16 16:52:40 2015 UTC,Would they keep breeding them if there were no people buying?

VictoriaBC,3dik7a,damendred,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Yep. We have a whole sub culture around dog shows and dog breeding. If the demand for purebred dogs dropped breeders would continue on.  I had friends that bred purebred dogs. They would have done it whether there was money involved or not.  Rabbits and cats also have a heavy breeding culture that would go on even if there wasn't financial incentives.
VictoriaBC,3dik7a,mrtherapist,5,Fri Jul 17 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my French bull dog puppy (I know, I know, I'm Hitler) is supposed to be pure bred, I know her parents and everything, but she's slightly longer than typical, probably due to some recent infusion of ('unpure') terrier in her recent lineage, and that's made her less likely to develop hip/spine issues, and she has no palate issues at all (which is common).  Not perfect to breed standards, but I'll take a healthier dog to being 15% stockier.  (inb4 ""you could just rescue a dog and it'd be healthier and cheaper"" I know  )"
VictoriaBC,3dik7a,TechnicallyITsCoffee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"Your dog is your dog. Doesn't matter if you paid or it is purebred. There are a lot of rescue dogs that are unwanted because of unusual behavioural trait combinations associated with their breeds. In your case you got a good mix. Awesome.  A French Bulldog, as a purebred, actually is has a reasonably large genetic pool to draw from right now. Palate issues in a french bulldog are significantly much less common than common genetic issues in a lot of other breeds. It isn't as healthy as full mutt, but it is pretty good as a purebred dog.  Take the english bulldog for example as a problem breed. They have high likelihood of having brachycephalic syndrome, hip dysplasia, ""dry eye"", pulmonic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. Then on top of all of those they have the same uncommon ones that the french bulldogs have.  The issue is that current breeders are not using the original template traits that define the breed. They are using the existing gene-pool to produce more similar dogs. The original breeders of those breeds drew from a wide variety of dogs to make up the original breed's traits."

Cars debates here ;) so, when the BCTransit job came up I couldn't pass it up. I'll still be here as /u/CommunityMike and have really appreciated everything reddit has given us as /u/VicPDCanada. The organization will still be here tho... It'll just be a different 'voice' as of Aug 10."
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,CommunityMike,4,Wed Jul 15 23:56:27 2015 UTC,Are you going to get a new reddit handle as an official BC Transit spokesperson?
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,Tweeeked,10,Thu Jul 16 00:55:34 2015 UTC,That is yet to be seen... First step is walk through the door ;-)
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,CommunityMike,23,Thu Jul 16 01:05:23 2015 UTC,wouldn't the first step be to safely wait for the bus to come to a compete stop and the door to open?
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,Jthallman,11,Thu Jul 16 01:42:23 2015 UTC,Hey-o!
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,CommunityMike,3,Thu Jul 16 01:49:31 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, aren't you excited for all the fun a BC Transit Reddit account could bring?     Hey Mike, my bus driver stole my dog and baby and sold them for crack on Pandora. Why do we let these things happen here but not in Ontario? I think the millennials must be running BC Transit"
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,SecretsoftheState,48,Thu Jul 16 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's a huge gain for BC Transit and a huge loss for VicPD. He was certainly the most visible and engaging police spokesperson I've ever encountered and I think the fact that Victorians have a generally favourable impression of VicPD is in no small part due to his interaction with the public. He is not a ""cop's cop"", and that's a good thing in this role."
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,CommunityMike,18,Wed Jul 15 23:42:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. There's A LOT of folks who walk the talk when it comes to community involvement in VicPD... I'm just active on social and discuss it with folks :)
VictoriaBC,3dfsh1,SecretsoftheState,7,Thu Jul 16 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"No doubt there are! I just hope that the next person in your role has the same appreciation for and understanding of the power of social media as a community engagement and trust-building tool when done right.   I don't know what your long term careers aspirations are, but I sincerely hope that you run for office one day. I think you'd make a fantastic city councillor or MLA.   Best of luck at BC Transit!"

He seemed like a great guy, and it's gonna be a big shame to VicPD that someone who took the initiative like he did is going to step down.  That said, I sincerely hope he enjoys the hell out of his new job."

VictoriaBC,3dh04f,typhereon,4,Thu Jul 16 05:03:54 2015 UTC,The Sooke Sailing Club does rentals for members I believe. The same with RVYC.   You'd probably have good luck getting on a boat by showing a good deal of interest down at RVYC. Most of the dinghy sailors from my experience seem pretty keen to get more people out on the water and racing.

VictoriaBC,3dejty,DeepThrust,5,Wed Jul 15 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"I've been up there twice and I absolutely love it. Normally it is pretty wet and muddy up there. However, you're right,  it's been pretty dry this year, so I would assume it wouldn't be too bad. . Its about 16km of mud and roots,  not much in the way of 'mountains' but the beach is breathtaking once you get up there. Apparently my uncle says there is also a lighthouse you can visit that has ice cold coca Colas! We were pretty tired when we made it up, so we didn't see that. But there a little shack there with some skim boards and maybe some other things (I can't remember). Took us around 8 hours to make it in. If it's dry and you keep a decent pace you can probably do it in 6.  Pretty fun overall. If there was any specific questions you had, feel free to ask!"
VictoriaBC,3dejty,ImOnTheWeed,4,Wed Jul 15 17:48:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for that info! When did you go? How was the drive on the logging road from Port Hardy? What time of year did you go and were mosquitoes an issue?
VictoriaBC,3dejty,ImOnTheWeed,6,Wed Jul 15 17:51:00 2015 UTC,"I went in August 2 years ago, and again in August last year.   The logging road in/out is not too bad (we took a Dodge van the first time and a Mazda mx3 the second time, so if you have a 4x4 you're golden.) just be wary of cougars if you need to get out to pee along the way.   I don't remember there being much in the way of mosquitoes. (but they don't really like the taste of me so I may be bias)   It's definitely a cool hike if you like a sorta jungle feel. And on top of that they have old pilgrimage stuff along the trail for you to see, like old saws and tools and stuff (it used to be a trail to get supplies from the beach to the town, the place you start). There's even this huge field right before you get to the beach that was clear cut by hand. It's insane to see how much they were able to do with so little."
VictoriaBC,3dejty,ImOnTheWeed,4,Wed Jul 15 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It sounds like an incredible place. I love looking at old stuff like that. One area I frequent in the Appalachian Mountains was purchased by the government in the 1930s. They made all the people there leave, so there is still a lot of old barns, sheds, etc. with old tools. They don't make them like the used to! I love exploring that kind of thing. I've never been in any sort of jungle/rainforest, so I can't wait to see it.   Normally I keep my eyes peeled for cougars at the bars. I'll keep that in mind if I step off the road for sure. Thanks again."

VictoriaBC,3dejty,bkplant,3,Thu Jul 16 02:57:23 2015 UTC,I hiked it when I was much younger with an uncle and totally didn't appreciate how cool it was. Neat to read more now...
VictoriaBC,3dejty,radihimi,3,Thu Jul 16 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"It's worth the drive IMO. But if you want solitude, camp at Guise or Nissen as Nels can get really busy in the summer. You can do the lighthouse as a day trip."
VictoriaBC,3dejty,radihimi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the tip. Are there other camp areas that are less crowded? We'll backpack and stay in the wilderness for a night or two, but the first night we'll probably have to camp by our car."
VictoriaBC,3dejty,spacegirl_spiff,2,Thu Jul 16 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"Close to the parking lot is San Josef Bay - so I'd def. do the short hike there for the first night rather than sleep in the parking lot. Or you can camp at Eric Lake not too far in on the main trail. It is not nearly as nice as San Jo, but it makes for a shorter hike to Cape Scott on the second day.   I'd try for Guise Bay the second night, or Experimental Bight which is a bit closer. Note the latter has no water supply, so you'll need to fill up at Nels. Guise Bay has a small creek at the southern end but you might need to climb the rocks to get at it. Both are beautiful and going to be more private than Nels, especially on a weekend this time of year.  If you only have two nights, you could hike to the lighthouse on the next day and return to the car, but that'll be a long day of hiking. Better to spend an extra night to allow a day trip to the lighthouse; you could move camp to Nissen for the last night, which would make for a shorter hike back to the car."
VictoriaBC,3dejty,spacegirl_spiff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:49 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll take all of this into consideration as we figure out what to do. This is helpful.

A few points:   I've talked to a few people more recently and they've there's a lot more boardwalk now. But expect to be walking on a road made of logs at some point. And it should be dry, but if it does rain expect some mud and some slick trail. I can't remember how far up the trail this is, but off the main trail there's a ruin of house where a family tried to settle up there. I won't give it away, but there is a monument that is also on the site that is quite impressive when you realize where you are.  If you make the day trip out to the light house and feel like packing one or two extra things, take some jelly bellys and/or jerky. There's a few things that the keepers can't order every month for their air shipment. I don't know how much that's changed over the years, but the thought would be nice.   If I remember anything else I'll post it!  Have fun! Hope the weather is kind to you!"

If you're unsure, did you take a water taxi or drive to the trailhead?   ""there is a monument that is also on the site that is quite impressive when you realize where you are."" I admit I just spent 45 minutes googling trying to figure out what you're talking about. Is it a grave? That's the only lead I found. Is it the old Danish settlement? Tell me dude!

I've also worked for ""bro culture"" organizations, and I have to say that it's lower stress when there is gender parity.

If you like the outdoors Victoria has quite a bit to offer. It's just not a big city, so it doesn't have the usual city attractions.  I love Victoria (lived here, lower mainland, US, elsewhere), but it's not for everyone. Just as Vancouver isn't for everyone (there are areas of the lower mainland I can't stand).  In both cities your budget is pretty meagre. Rental vacancy is quite low and housing is quite expensive to purchase (which is reflected in rental costs)."

VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,samuraipizzacat71,5,Wed Jul 15 03:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they did a similar deal for me. Offered me $5 off my $70 internet. It was a pretty easy decision to go with Juce."
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,zariczky,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"Same with me. I actually called and asked what they would offer me if I told them I was cancelling and they offered me $5 off TV and $5 off internet. I ended up taking my modem back to Shaw and asked to cancel internet and they didn't even ask me why or any questions. This was in May, though. As long as Juce is still around I'll be with them. Very impressed with their service and pricing."
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,RyanKeslerSucks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:58:34 2015 UTC,Same here too.  Slap in the face when you consider that is still more than what Juce is offering...    They must be taking them more seriously now!
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,Fe02c,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:59:49 2015 UTC,I just told them I wanted to end my service and I didn't get offered anything. I also didn't get nagged about paying anything. But they did insist on getting that crusty old modem back.
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,MandelBra,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:56 2015 UTC,Shaw still owes me $49. They said they were going to mail me a cheque. When it's you who owes them money they're on you like crazy but when it's the other way around - oh better take my sweet ass time.
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,samuraipizzacat71,8,Thu Jul 16 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"I switched as well, don't bother calling Shaw, bring your equipment into the store and cancel there."
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,Greatdeadeye,4,Wed Jul 15 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"I am considering Juce as well, my concern would be losing wifi access around the city because I use it a lot."
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,wrgrant,3,Wed Jul 15 03:02:19 2015 UTC,With shaw go Wifi you can add up to 6 devices (i think) to your account. find a friend/relative who has shaw and ask them if they can add your device.
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,iphoneit,3,Wed Jul 15 03:28:31 2015 UTC,I did exactly this.
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,samuraipizzacat71,2,Wed Jul 15 04:11:49 2015 UTC,i'm still using the account of a job i quit months ago.  kinda dreading the day they figure that one out.
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,cptpedantic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:01:20 2015 UTC,The number of devices allowed depends on which internet package you have. And I've already got my family on my Shaw Wifi list so there'd be a bunch of us needing to leverage somebody else's account...
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,ThreeEasyPayments,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:36:45 2015 UTC,"I plan on asking Juce what happens with regards to this but I will look at ""borrowing"" wifi listings as well. Although I think you can connect as a Guest on Shaw Wifi as well, not sure."
VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,wrgrant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:03:48 2015 UTC,Some you can some you can't.  I believe it's mostly just the parks that are free shaw wifi.  Great feature from shaw though.  Wish pricing was a bit lower still.

VictoriaBC,3dbtvm,Fiduciary_One,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Same here on both counts.  The issues were only there for 2 or 3 days for me and ever since then it's been smooth sailing.  THe only differences I notice vs shaw now is my downloads/streaming are faster and my bill is smaller. (I do mooch off my parent's shawOpen since they don't have any devices to register)

VictoriaBC,3dcxxw,VicCity,4,Wed Jul 15 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"I empathize with you and I think that you deserve medical coverage, however, I don't think cooks should be punished because your employer does not give servers better benefits."

VictoriaBC,3dcxxw,bubongo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:50:49 2015 UTC,$3 more than the servers is how much? Maybe $13/hour? I'm not saying servers don't work hard but that wage gap is terrible. In the article the guy from the restaurant association says with tips factored in servers are making $25/hour.

There are some nights where I've seen girls take home tonnes of money, and other nights where they've made less than minimum wage WITH their tips.   You can't really guarantee your income as a server.  I'm not saying kitchen should not receive a tip out, it's that servers are not the money bags you insist they are.  This is a very expensive city to live in, serving is the first job I've ever worked where my family has been able to both make ends meet and save a little bit, but it's not like we're 'rich', but this is the first time neither me or my husband have had to work 2 jobs.

If restaurants can have their pick of people willing to cook for a low wage, why invest in a career chef?  There are tourists to fleece in the summer, so the pressure to offer a quality product is pretty low compared to other markets I bet.  Easy if you don't need to care about repeat business.

A few things I'd like to see:   Inter-agency sharing of stolen/found bikes using a cross province / cross Canada standard Online method for anyone to search on a serial number to see if it is lost / found Online method for people to self-report bikes they own. Update contact details. Records should also include a picture of the bike.   Privacy / Security Controls:   Citizens can't view contact details, only update them Citizens can't mark a bike as stolen/found, must be done via police Logging of all requests / changes kept against each bike serial number When police find a bike, they don't assume last submitted address is correct.

Their son phoned the cops and a dog team was called. The thieves couldn't get the bike, so instead removed the handlebars and so on.  Yes! For once the bike thieves had been caught in the act, with a dog team, no less!  We immediately phoned the cops to get the handlebar, only to learn the officer in charge was away on vacation for a week. It would cost about a hundred dollars to replaces the handlebars and brake levers (it was a fairly nice bike that we had gotten used) so we were hoping the cop would allow us to reclaim the stolen bars.  A week went by, and the cop called us back.  ""Can we get our handlbars back?"" I asked.  ""Oh, those were your handlebars? The two guys were carrying some handlebars but they said they belonged to them, so we had to give them back.""  Not a big deal, but my son was 11 at the time.  It might be a better idea to figure out who the hell is buying stolen bikes and bike parts and then selling them.  My son's bike would be stolen anyway. They probably got five hits of crack for it.

A bar in Vancouver is hosting one and 3 bars in Toronto so far, was hoping Victoria would as well.  To the people who don't like video games it seems like a weird thing to attend (watching other people play video games) but its very similar to watching any other major sporting event (people rooting for teams/players big plays etc).

Friend of mine makes ice cream for a living. He said the reason we get so much fluffy gross ice cream these days is because ice cream is sold by volume not by weight. Ingredients go up in price, they just add more air to make it fill the tub.  Also, for the purposes of making ice cream, skim milk with butter added can be labelled as cream. So they can get skim milk that was on shelves back, re-pasteurize, add butter to bring the fat up to 3.25% then call it cream. In my books that ain't cream. That's gross old milk with butter in it."

The product is created and funded by professionals in association with the University of British Columbia and it was an incredibly fascinating dataset to work with. We built a ""calculator"" that more or less walks you through a set of questions and provides a number as to how screwed you are. I was only involved in prototype stage so I only had an example dataset to work with, but it was incredibly enlightening to read about the facets of earthquake protection.  Some of the things that go into the safety assessment are:   Type of soil your property is on What kind of roofing it has What kind of floor your basement has Exterior sheathing Window size Interior finish   The service can also estimate your annualized repair cost, or what I assume to be how much you might have to budget to repair your house over a few years if some seismic event happens (it's a little ambiguous, gives the readout in points not dollars). This product is set up to be administered by registered engineers so there's some interpretation that needs to happen, which is why it's not available to the general public.  If you have questions, I might be able to answer them... and I can definitely put you in touch with the lead engineer on the product! Sorry for the spam, it just seemed relevant."

VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,cashewbutts,12,Tue Jul 14 00:29:44 2015 UTC,"edit: read Both_Whynotboth's comment below about the elevation of our area ""subsiding"" i.e., DROPPING by as much as 8 ft. Apparently this is a big concern! Factor that into your planning.  I have also heard that in a megathrust quake the island's elevation could be raised or lowered by as much as 150 ft. Scary!  don't be in an old brick building whose structural strength is in the masonry. ""old town"" in general is a bad place to be.  after wellington NZ's last serious quake they abandoned their heritage preservation focus (like what we still have) and focused on seismic codes. much more important IMO.  victoria has a wide range of places that would be safe or unsafe in a massive quake. google the crd composite earthquake hazard map. it will show you where to expect liquefaction and slope instability. in general, if you're in a building newer than 30 years old, on bedrock, 30m above sea level, you're probably OK. unless you have natural gas and your house starts burning...  it's definitely a good idea to have a rifle for hunting and a week's worth of calories and water to consume.  stay away from the shore after a quake, but remember tsunamis don't turn corners.   the risks are there, but realistically it's not that bad unless you're in a building that's gonna collapse. the chances of a massive quake's epicentre striking exactly under victoria are pretty slim. we'll surely be affected seriously by a megaquake at some point, but chances are it won't kill you."
VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,Both_WhyNotBoth,9,Tue Jul 14 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"remember tsunamis don't turn corners   There's a really important idea that they touch on in this article, that I would like to see more attention on because most people miss the importance of it. When the tsunami arrives in Japan, it'll be just a big wave, but what will happen here is different. When this big event happens, our entire region will subside, possibly as much as 8 feet. Think about pushing an empty bowl into water and how the water rushes in. Now think about Puget Sound, the Georgia straight, Burrard inlet. All these areas will suddenly drop significantly, and ocean water will come rushing in to fill it, as well as the quake-caused wave. The are some videos from Japan showing an entire harbor area filling like a bathtub. Here. It's not a wave. It's a tidal surge."

VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,dabears1020,3,Tue Jul 14 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"The video you linked is just showing a pretty standard tsunami. Not saying subsidence wont happen, but what you linked as an example is not that. A tsunami will never really be observed as a single wave, but rather the entire sea lifting up and filling in the whole area. This can easily be misinterpreted as the whole earth sinking into the ocean, when it's really just that the period of the wave is so large that it stretches further than you can reasonably see and a single ""wave"" from the tsunami can take 20 minutes before it reaches its crest."
VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,Both_WhyNotBoth,3,Tue Jul 14 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you've determined that subsidence was not a factor in that video. There a number of articles discussing the subsidence that occurred at that earthquake. For example. It is expected, as was mentioned in this New Yorker article, that there will be significant subsidence along the Cascadia fault. As there was in the event in 1700. Regardless, My point was dispel the idea that tsunamis ""don't turn corners"".  This is the video that I had been looking for yesterday I don't want to get dragged into a debate about the specific mechanisms at work, I want people to understand that no part of the coast can be considered safe. A tidal surge is not a wave and cannot be dodged. Yes, it will take a right at Neah Bay, and a left at Race Rocks etc, etc. It will fill every space, every bay, every harbor along the way, and then slosh around like a bathtub."
VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,blazeofgloreee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"We are still likely to be protected from the full force of the tsunami though, at least based on the predictions I've been reading. 1-5 meter surge is what is predicted, as opposed to up to 15m on the west coast. Of course that could be wrong though.  http://www.geomika.com/blog/2011/03/12/tsunami-on-the-west-coast/tsunami_bc/"
VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,Both_WhyNotBoth,2,Tue Jul 14 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think that Victoria is generally going to be fairly ok, because of the rocks and the elevation. (God help the poor schmucks in Richmond.) I also think that being a peninsula will likely help as well. A trapped tsunami will raise up like it did in Port Alberni in 1964. It just bothers me when people use bad science. I've talked to several people that live on the water on the west side of the island that think they are under zero risk from tsunami because of the ""waves can't turn corners"" BS."
VictoriaBC,3d6ypt,blazeofgloreee,2,Tue Jul 14 21:24:19 2015 UTC,Ah yeah I see what you mean. Yes the west coast of the island is a big risk for anyone down near water level.

VictoriaBC,3d6leh,spacegirl_spiff,3,Tue Jul 14 04:46:07 2015 UTC,"Vancouver is already fine to bike down minus the clusterfuck around the Caledonia crossing. drivers turning left will forever ignore the cyclists going straight, drivers going straight will stop for cyclists even though they have right of way - I understand they're trying to be courteous but that's what leads to accidents! Caledonia to Pandora is very narrow but then widens up to a good bike route. I don't know if Vancouver needs protected lanes at the highest priority, the bulk of it is low traffic, nice and wide.   The bike lane on Pandora will be nice - as you get into downtown the right lane keeps becoming right-turn only and as a cyclist switching between that and the straight-thru lanes it's hard to be predictable for cars. In my experience."

I never have issues biking down pandora during rush hour.   JOHNSON, on the other hand, is up hill from store to cook.  i can't keep up with traffic, i get overtaken in reckless ways almost everyday (cars coming into my lane) and i've experience more car on bike road rage on my ride back to home from the office. this is where we need dedicated bike lanes, not pandora.

VictoriaBC,3d6leh,james121345,-4,Tue Jul 14 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, make it bike friendly down town, just don't create problems while trying to solve a problem, plan ahead.  Removing even more parking from the downtown area is a terrible idea and the fact that nobody can see that is laughable.  Downtown is dying a slow painful death and nobody seems to be doing anything about it except proposing idiotic idea's that will only further hurt our city.  Tourists get downtown five ways, they drive, they bike, they walk, they ride the bus or they come in on the Clipper (no problem with that currently), our goal should be making it as accessible as possible for all of those five ways not just one or two to maximize the amount of people we entertain during the tourism season."
VictoriaBC,3d6leh,GameAddikt,9,Tue Jul 14 06:21:36 2015 UTC,"If you look at why the top cyclist friendly cities are the top cyclist friendly cities, it's because they ""limit the amount and speed of cars in city centers."" Making it more convienent to bike/bus/walk is HOW you get more people to use those forms of transportation. Make streets ped/cyclist only is one way. Larger bike lanes, instead of the puny single bike lanes we use. Not only does it improve health, but improves pollution. Attracting more tourists.  The North American mentality of motorists first needs to be scrapped to really accommodate a ""cyclist friendly"" environment. The arguement that ""if you make it harder for cars to use downtown tourist centers, you make it harder for tourists to get in"" doesn't hold up. You compare it to tourist centers in Europe and you can see the example of why its wrong."

As it says in the article, she was one of two councilors who voted against the project in the first place.   The reality is that if the team of project managers and engineers tell  council they need more money to get this thing done properly, the city has to agree. What are they supposed to do, say no and have them cut corners on a piece of major infrastructure? What good would that do other than appease public opinion?"

VictoriaBC,3cy3ub,NutellaMonger,14,Sat Jul 11 20:52:17 2015 UTC,That's most likely Petrichor!
VictoriaBC,3cy3ub,AdmiralJuz,6,Sat Jul 11 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"Petrichor:       Petrichor (/ˈpɛtrɨkɔər/) is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. The word is constructed from Greek, petra, meaning ‘stone’, + ichor, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.  The term was coined in 1964 by two researchers, Isabel Joy Bear (Australian) and Roderick G. Thomas (British), for an article in the journal Nature.   In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay-based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin, a metabolic by-product of certain Actinobacteria, which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning.  In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil retards seed germination and early plant growth.  This would indicate that the plants exude the oil in order to safeguard the seeds from germination under duress.  In 2015, MIT scientists used high-speed cameras to record how the scent moves into the air.  The tests involved approximately 600 experiments on 28 different surfaces, including engineered materials and soil samples.  When a raindrop hits a porous surface, small bubbles form that float to the surface and release aerosols.  Such aerosols carry the scent as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil.  Raindrops that move at a slower rate tend to produce more aerosols; this serves as an explanation for why the petrichor is more common after light rains.

VictoriaBC,3d0zsk,ILoveBabyBats,2,Sun Jul 12 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"This is not really true. Wine requires new oak and so each winery produces hundreds (or thousands) of barrels every year.  When  I worked at a winery (in the Okanagan) we sold the barrels for $100 but that they were fancy and branded.  Staff could take them home for free.   You are correct in that some barrels are more expensive. The increased demand on Bourbon barrels means that the price has tripled in the last few years, and sherry casks (which are larger and massively in demand) can be thousands of dollars. However their value comes from the liquid that was inside them, not the oak itself. Red wine aging is not used in much commercial spirit production so their value is significantly reduced."

He said they're not very effective and that's why they signed a contract to use something better.  Probably good for sprout lake fire as its right beside a lake....  The guy basically said in most fires the distance between the fire and a suitable lake for them is so great that you end up spending a ton of time flying and refueling.  Then they don't deal well with smoke so its hard to drop accurately.  Plus they can't carry fire retardant.  Can't find the article now though if anyone wants to help

VictoriaBC,3ctc55,stevo911_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"Fires are actually an important part of a forests lifecycle (pulled from a quick web search): They return nutrients to the soil by burning dead or decaying matter.  They also act as a disinfectant, removing disease-ridden plants and harmful insects from a forest ecosystem.  And by burning through thick canopies and brushy undergrowth, wildfires allow sunlight to reach the forest floor, enabling a new generation of seedlings to grow. (If you've ever walked through really old forests, there's not a lot of undergrowth which results in little food for wildlife)  If we were living in a land of endless financial resources, having the bomber might make sense. In a province of budgetary constraints spending lots of money on an outdated/unreliable piece of equipment, that costs lots to operate, and doesn't do as effective a job as the alternatives (except in very specific situations), we're better off without the bomber.  If you own a cabin in the woods, fires are a risk, that's what insurance is for.  Another note: Airplanes aren't like cars, they can't just sit there for a while and then fire up right away.  There's lots of (costly) maintenance that needs to be done, so it couldn't just fly ""at will"" it's been grounded for a couple years in lieu of better alternative equipment."
VictoriaBC,3ctc55,stevo911_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"A) Coastal doug fir forest regens with fire events. No on is arguing about that.   B) If the province can't protect it's citizens assets, perhaps it should reconsider it's priorities.  Unless you live in a city, you don't have much of a choice whether or not you live in / near a forest. Saying 'tough luck' is not acceptable imho."
VictoriaBC,3ctc55,kirijo,0,Tue Jul 14 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"1) Never said anyone was arguing that, just pointing it out because lots of people are unaware fires (away from homes) are a good thing.  B) Wasting a bunch of money on a piece of crap that that can't do it's job properly and belongs in a museum  ""just in case"" a very specific long-shot scenario unfolds doesn't make fiscal sense.  These weren't primary residences at risk, they were recreational properties, that were literally out in the woods.  And they've been doing a good job of protecting assets in an unusually bad fire year, ONE cabin was lost in the whole ordeal, without the mars bomber ever getting involved.  With that logic, the we should also put in twice as many fire halls, hospitals, and police stations, hell let's put one on every 5 blocks, because cost is no object right when it comes to protecting it's citizens and their assets?   This is the real world where real world decisions need to be made, and the Mars isn't a practical solution."

VictoriaBC,3cqpcr,theanzie,14,Fri Jul 10 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"Busking in Victoria requires a license. There are two different busking licenses in Victoria. The first license costs something like $10 or $20 per year and is issued by the city of Victoria. It covers all permitted busking locations except for the Inner Harbour. No audition required. The second busking license costs around $200 per year (including liability insurance coverage) and is issued by the Greater Victoria Harbour Authority (GVHA). This is the license you need if you plan to busk at the Inner Harbour. This license requires an audition. Some people do busk throughout the year. Not many do so at the Inner Harbour, which is really quiet in winter, but on Government St., or at the central library courtyard, and of course, in front of liquor stores.  I don't believe electronic amplification is permitted. There may be exceptions. Contact the city for clarification. I would link to their website and the appropriate page but it's recently been updated so unfortunately this would not be helpful. Here is the GVHA busking page for busking at the Inner Harbour: http://www.victoriaharbour.org/f_licensee.php   Victoria long-time busker Country Dave Ryerson's blog. He has a wealth of information regarding busking in the city. Contact him through his blog for further questions: http://countrydave.blogspot.ca/"

BUT after about 7pm they don't patrol it anymore so I can busk without hassle and without a licesne from 7pm till late at night.... is there anything like that in Vic? :)   The same is true in Victoria. The commissionaires are finished work in the early evening. (I think they're done at 6 pm - except the library courtyard, which is monitored 24/7.) At the Inner Harbour, in the summer months, there are buskers who play late into the night and if you are playing there with amplification and without a license you're going to be politely hassled. Once you're deep into the month of October it's more or less pointless to play at the Inner Harbour, at least financially. For the other locations in the city, a $20 license is a trivial cost for remaining hassle free.   I am not trying to subtly dissuade you from Victoria, but just keep in mind that there are quite a few Gulf Islands in the region too. The Gulf Islands are typically very welcoming of musicians and artists, many inhabitants being artists and musicians themselves. They are all easy to get to with a bicycle via ferry. Also, you can cycle up most of the eastern side of Vancouver Island and never be very far from a city or small community where you might want to play. I'm thinking between Victoria and the city of Courtenay. I wouldn't suggest going as far north as Campbell River on the east side, and you should not ride to Tofino on the west coast of Vancouver Island as the road and traffic is not safe for cyclists."

That is also found mostly on women, is why they would be good at cutting it. Because that's their job, is to cut women's hair all day. Women have long hair usually. Some don't I guess but even the ones that have short hair never go to a barber. That's weird right? I mean, If I were a lady and I had short hair I'd definitely go to a barber. Because a barber is like 10 bucks and a lady hair salon is probably a lot more. I don't really know how much more though, because I've never been to one. For a haircut. I mean I've obviously been to one, but just with a girlfriend or whatever, I wouldn't just go hang around one for no reason. Although you could probably meet a lot of nice women there. Is that why you grew your hair long? To meet nice women at the hair salon? That's a pretty good plan."

Even in a survival suit you only have a few hours of survivability in the ocean here and his army experience wont help him with that. The currents around Race Rocks hits 20+ knots and so I am making a guess that he got caught n one of these currents and was sucked out into the strait.   I am a diver myself with the exception that I don't dive in Canada due to the myriad of reasons that compound the risk of accidents like this, cold water, murky water, strong currents all make for a complicated dive.

VictoriaBC,3cfrih,bendershead,4,Tue Jul 7 19:14:37 2015 UTC,How do you force deer to move back to the (continually smaller and smaller) woods?
VictoriaBC,3cfrih,bendershead,3,Tue Jul 7 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"While human encroachment is an issue, there is still a lot of wilderness for deer to live in. However, a more significant factor in deer moving into urban areas is that they have come to associate the city with safety--safety from cougars and anything else that might hunt them. The obvious solution then is to take that safety away. Make the cities too dangerous for deer to live in. Cars can't do it all and humane culling is too controversial, so we would have to either introduce cougars or hunters. If we don't want to introduce natural predators who might decide to raid schoolyards or allow drunken hunters to fire their guns in densely populated neighbourhoods, a good alternative would be to feed all the Bambi-lovers to the starving cougars."

The newer Canon rebels are generally good. For what she wants to do, I don't think you can really go wrong with any Canon or Nikon DSLR, but the newer ones are always improving.   Just a note that some of the cheaper Nikon lenses won't work properly on lower end Nikon DSLRs (no autofocus), so Canon might be cheaper to get decent lenses for.   I highly recommend the Canon 50mm 1.8 lens or Nikon 50mm 1.8G (I think that's the letter - it's the more expensive of the D and G) if she wants to do any portraits or photos in dimly lit situations."

VictoriaBC,3cbyhb,dubbreak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Yup just with the 18-135 STM. I like the lens. I can't afford much more so I make do with what I have. I quite like the lens. It's better than my old 18-55 with my old Canon XTI  Thanks for the positive feedback!
VictoriaBC,3cbyhb,lorem_-ipsum,2,Tue Jul 7 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely a nicer lens than the kit 18-55. I have one of those without OIS (so probably the same one). The 18-135mm actually has a usable focus ring and is much better built, which makes sense since it's actually a $600+ lens outside a kit.  It has been said a million times, but gear has very little to do with good shots. You can take a great photo with a smart phone or a point and shoot. Composition is way more important.  One of my favorite lenses is the ""nifty fifty"" 50mm 1.8F Canon, which are dirt cheap (and feel like a plastic toy). They now make an STM version that is about $30 more and looks a lot better built. You can get some great short DoF shots with it and it's great for doing flash-less photography indoors. A few of my friends have the 40mm pancake lens. Another great bang for the buck."
VictoriaBC,3cbyhb,dronehero,2,Tue Jul 7 17:18:42 2015 UTC,I'm going to be getting the 50mm STM one day soon. I think first I'll be getting the 55-250 STM telephoto.

VictoriaBC,3ceagc,KitAFD,4,Tue Jul 7 06:11:23 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind James Bay is kind of isolated from the rest of Victoria, and significantly colder (Like 5 degrees due to the constant wind), and would be a pain to get to-from UVic"
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,stevo911_,5,Tue Jul 7 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"The first time I rented with Brown Bros., it was great.  The second time I rented with Brown Bros. a year later, same building, same manager, they fucked me over, hard.  I will never rent with them again, and I would not have considered buying a place that was managed by a Brown Bros. agent.  The only other friend I know who has rented with Brown Bros. also had a bad experience and wouldn't rent with them again, but didn't want to get into it when I asked.    The only specific place I'd avoid is crack towers (View Towers, downtown).  Not only for the obvious reasons (crack towers, c'mon) but for their shitty management and how they treated residents affected by the fire a few years back (2014, 2013?).  All the bus lines here are meh.  BCtransit will do a thing and say it's for increased ridership and reliability or something, but it will always end up making things worse.  Just plan to catch a bus or two earlier than the one you'd need, so that you'll still be on time if you end up with late busses or a route just being skipped.  You'd be most affected by traffic if you were bussing in from Langford (the 'Colwood Crawl') but it shouldn't be a big issue, unless you live closer to UVic where you're more likely to get passed up by a full bus or two, mostly just during the first two weeks of the semester or so ;)  It depends on how you eat (lots of frozen, convenience foods?  Lots of fresh meats, produce?) for what stores you'll want to shop at!  Fairways is usually pretty decent for prices, because they are the ""B quality"" place for ugly produce and slightly-less quality meat rejected by ""A quality"" retailers.  If you're okay with going out of your way to different places, Root Cellar has great deals on produce in the summer (but price-checking against other places is a must) and I've found better deals at places like Market on Yates and Wellburn's when I was living downtown.  Thrifty Foods has great online ordering and delivery if you don't have a car.  Save-on recently started a promotion of having the best prices on ""hundreds of everyday items"" or whatever, so even if they had cucumbers sale priced at 1.25 in the flyer, they might be down to 99c in stores to match the sale price of other major grocery retailers.  There's also a bunch of CSA's here, and the Good Food Box is a good one that you can pick up every other week in the SUB at UVic if you're interested in that :)  I've used Pad Mapper to find my previous apartments."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,sotepetsenu,5,Tue Jul 7 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"Been dealing with Equitex in a very nice building in Chinatown and I have no complaints. Sadly, Walmart is pretty much the best overall deal for groceries in town. I came here from Ontario, where there's not just No Frills but also Food Basics and Freshco in the same discount-grocery-staples model, and food prices here were a shock. You're probably going to find that queer life here is pretty quiet no matter where you live."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,dentonite,6,Tue Jul 7 16:31:56 2015 UTC,stay the fuck away from apartments r us.
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,nrtphotos,3,Wed Jul 8 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in a Devon Properties, they seem well organised/well run/fair prices.  I suspect a lot depends on the building manager they have running each place.  Fairways and Country Grocer (and Walmart) tend to be the cheapest, there are probably some one-off smaller stores around that are competitive too.  I'm partial to Country Grocer.  Save-On has some good sales, and I think is typically a bit cheaper than Thriftys/Safeway  Any bus lines that run down Quadra near McKenzie I suspect will be pretty unreliable due to all the road construction going on for the next who knows how long (3-6 months+)"
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,stevo911_,2,Tue Jul 7 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"Me and my SO are shopping around right now, and I just wanted to point out that several of the China Town apartments were listed when we moved into our current place (1 year ago) and when we moved into our previous place (exactly 2 years ago).  Could just be lease timing, but thought I should pass that caveat along.   Best of luck with your search."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,The_Thresh_Prince,2,Tue Jul 7 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"If you don't have wheels, you could find someone that goes to Costco now and then; that will be the cheapest food, but you have to watch the quantities you buy obviously. Otherwise, Fairway Market has great prices. Avoid their meats though as they are not very good quality."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,canadianpastafarian,2,Tue Jul 7 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"If you're going to UVic, buy your food at the Rootcellar. Their produce is the freshest, and there's a full butcher/deli instore."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,chroneliu5,6,Tue Jul 7 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"Red Barn is better and cheaper, IMO."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,canadianpastafarian,3,Tue Jul 7 15:24:12 2015 UTC,agreed
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,TechnicallyITsCoffee,2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:30 2015 UTC,They can be super expensive though (OP asked for cheap)
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,stevo911_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"produce, yes, but as previously mentioned, know comparable prices.  Meat is crazy expensive.  Pepper's in Cadboro Bay is convenient to UVic, and often has good local chicken on sale for around $10/whole bird.  However, their staple prices can be really high, and veggies aren't well priced.  They offer 10% discount with student id."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,orangeisthebestcolor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:29 2015 UTC,I drive from across town to buy produce from the root cellar. They have the best selection and reasonably priced. Staples and meats are expensive though.  Chinatown produce is also cheap.
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,cranberryjello,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Vic West or anything on the 14 bus route, it's the start of the route to UVIC so you'd be less affected by ""pass by's"" on busy days. Great access to the Galloping Goose trail for bike commuting and less popular than Fernwood. The area is on the come-up, lots of folks seem to be moving from Fernwood to Vic West/Esquimalt to save/get more for their $$$."
VictoriaBC,3ceagc,ejmears,0,Wed Jul 8 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Fernwood I think sounds like it would be good for you.  Cheaper then James bay and a similar vibe.  Close to uvic.  Fun street to hang out on with most amenities in walking distance.  Only downside is you're a bit further from the ocean then other areas.

VictoriaBC,3cdfei,anurag992,7,Tue Jul 7 01:23:34 2015 UTC,"The nearest bus stop to Leechtown along the Galloping Goose is for the #61 in Saseenos, at about the km 41 marker. Once you reach the end, you'll need to turn around and come back about 15 km, but the nice thing is that it's mostly downhill on the way back. Sometimes bike racks fill up in Sooke, so you might be waiting a couple of buses to find one with an empty spot. Also some #61 buses change to #50 and continue downtown, others do a short turn in Langford and head back out to Sooke, it's best to ask the bus driver or transfer at Langford Exchange.  A rough list of kilometer posts on the Goose:    0 - Downtown Victoria 1 -Vic West 4 - Uptown 8 - Vic General Hospital 13 - Colwood Corners 17 - Langford (Belmont) 19 - Happy Valley 25 - Metchosin 31 - Matheson Lake 35 - Roche Cove (big hill here at Grouse Nest where a trestle was removed, plus another one a couple of km up the line at Veitch Creek) 41 - Saseenos 44 - Milne's Landing - a couple of original trestles are still used between here and Deer Trails 48 - Deer Trails Resort / Sooke Potholes - a timber resort lodge that was never completed in the eighties, only the foundation remains. An old rail station converted to a shelter is a little further up the line too. 56 - Leechtown - there's some old mining equipment and the remains of an old bus here. Not too much else. The Wolf Creek trestle was removed about twelve years ago and the Sooke Lake watershed fenced off; prior to this it was possible to continue up past Sooke Lake to Shawnigan Lake.   Take care, and have spare tire tubes and tools for repairs with you - after Milne's Landing there are no houses except for Deer Trails, and it sucks to get stranded in Leechtown and have to walk the bike back."
VictoriaBC,3cdfei,emilydm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:10 2015 UTC,Super informative post!
VictoriaBC,3cdfei,MoonDaddy,3,Sun Jul 12 09:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think you should call BC Transit and be absolutely sure that Sooke buses have bike racks. I know lots of city buses have racks but it doesn't seem likely to me that the Sooke buses would. Most people that would ride the Goose to Sooke would ride both ways.  All I could find on the BC Transit site was this, and it wasn't very helpful: http://bctransit.com/victoria/riderinfo/bike-racks-and-lockers  As far as how long it takes, it's mostly flat. Only you know how fast you can ride on flat roads but at least you don't have to take any big hills into account. If I was you I'd leave as early as possible since it's pretty hot and hazy right now (hot by Victoria standards, maybe not if you're from Texas or something).  One of my favourite places on the Island is Roche Cove which is right beside the Goose."
VictoriaBC,3cdfei,Sasken,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:41:48 2015 UTC,I haven't seen a bc transit bus in Victoria without racks.   I'd get off the trail at the Sooke rd crossing in Saseenos. you can go 6km from there into Sooke riding on sooke rd (there's ample shoulder) where there's some strip mall plazas. you'll probably want a real bathroom or a treat after that ride instead of going straight onto a bus. It's a little uphill after traversing the flat goose but nothing terrible.
VictoriaBC,3cdfei,capslox,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"It's a really nice ride,  lots of water and snacks plus a towel to swim at Matheson Lake.  Last time I did it on a slow full suspension mountain bike and wished I had my cyclecross bike  instead."

VictoriaBC,3cd6on,XavierWoodshed,2,Tue Jul 7 01:11:11 2015 UTC,It can absolutely be an issue in Victoria. I've boarded at Swartz many times and have seen people turned away due to high volume and nowhere to put luggage.

VictoriaBC,3cbali,evabean,3,Mon Jul 6 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"Homemade isn't bad. It's nice to get some control over it since some of the 'brands' are terribly inconsistent with flavors/quality.  Heck I've even had 'regular' jerky with issues where it will be too sweet/spicy, almost like they cross contaminated with other flavors and didn't care.  Plus if you get good with beef you can try fish. Trout makes really good smokey 'candy'."
VictoriaBC,3cc7ry,nofoullanguage,2,Mon Jul 6 19:52:33 2015 UTC,It's called the Bay Cafe and it's on the 5th floor of the Bay Centre  :)  It doesn't seem like they have a direct number but you can reach them through the main number: (250) 385-1311

VictoriaBC,3cc7ry,JabbaTheWock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:00:39 2015 UTC,So is it still open or closed for renos or closed permanently?  Do you know? I just head a rumor that it was closed
VictoriaBC,3cc7ry,mjw11,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"It's still there, and it's definitely still open! Our book club meets there once a month. We don't usually order food so i don't know how good it is, but the tea and coffee is cheap and it has a great view of the harbour. The easiest way to find it is to take the elevator instead of the escalator, and look for the marlin travel sign. The cafe itself is not advertised very well."

VictoriaBC,3ccb94,ninethreeseven,2,Mon Jul 6 22:19:13 2015 UTC,The best pork belly I've ever had. And he caramel chicken is soo good too.
VictoriaBC,3ccb94,BigFuckinHammer,3,Mon Jul 6 22:26:13 2015 UTC,"Tacofino near the corner of Fort and Blanshard - Best nacho's in town imo, and they have amazing burritos and tacos.  Pig for their delicious BBQ, you can't go wrong with a Pulled Pork Poutine  La Authentique parks outside The Duke on the weekend evenings sometimes, also really good food for a decent price, and those dudes are nice as hell, hook it up pretty good - Burgers, Poutine  La Fiesta on Broughton and Douglas - Huge burritos and pretty tasty, I like getting them Chimichanga'd :D  The Pink Bicycle has some great burgers you can get for takeout  And if your up for a good priced, huge meal, sit down restaurant, hit up Floyd's on Yates & Quadra - Great breakfast/lunch for those after-partying nights  That's all I can think of right now off the top of my head - Victoria has so many places, it does take time and money to find the good spots"
VictoriaBC,3ccb94,canuckley,5,Tue Jul 7 17:15:47 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of La Taquisa.  Someone else mentioned Italian Food Imports.  I forgot about them.  Sandwiches so good.
VictoriaBC,3ccb94,EskimoDave,6,Tue Jul 7 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"There are so many, I wouldn't know where to start. One that not a lot of people frequent (or used to be the case) is the Italian Food Import deli. It's on Blanshard, between Fort and View if memory serves.   If you feel like a trek across the Johnson St. bridge, La Belle Patate serves excellent poutine in massive portions.  Good luck on your hunt."
VictoriaBC,3ccb94,Cyborgazm,5,Mon Jul 6 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"I'll second the Italian Food Imports. Their meatball sandwich is $5.75 (I think), and it always leaves me stuffed!    Another good place that's resonantly close to downtown is Fairfield Fish & Chips. Their chips are very cheap and very filling. I usually get a burger meal, which will set you back under $10, and is more than enough to fill you up."
VictoriaBC,3ccb94,FRABAR,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"FYI Italian is only for lunch. They sometimes have a few pastas left at 3, but not much."

It's a ""fallout social taboo"" :)  Personally I've been a fan since its first installment in 1997 and as many fan of the series I followed through the franchise's tribulations.

VictoriaBC,3c9i2l,Sasken,2,Mon Jul 6 04:06:58 2015 UTC,"Supposed to be a wind coming from the west. It probably won't help overall with the fires, but it'll blow the smoke away from the coast at least."
VictoriaBC,3c9i2l,TemplesOfSyrinx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:56:27 2015 UTC,Last night (the 5th) I'd heard that it was meant to clear up somewhat by tonight (the 6th) but this morning I read reports that it might be around most of today and this evening.  Fires in the summer time are pretty normal. It's just a bit early this year because of the recent heat wave. The fact that the smoke is contained around the lower mainland and Victoria is something of a fluke.
VictoriaBC,3c9i2l,iSpeezy,0,Mon Jul 6 14:28:05 2015 UTC,It will probably get worst sooner then get better later. There seems to be a wildfire popping up every hour somewhere in BC. Too dry

I love food trucks and didn't even know this was happening until I randomly walked past the museum yesterday and saw the signs. (Ironically, I'd walked down there from the Food Truck-Up event in Centennial Square, which was pretty disappointing -- went during the lunch hour and there were only about 12 trucks there, nothing like the 25+ boasted by the Truck-Up organizers.)  Was totally stoked to find Love Perogy at the museum's event, I've been wanting to try them for ages. The sliders were amaaaazing."

Yes, I get it, Mr and Mrs Municipal Councilperson, growth is great for your budget bottom line but really let's talk about how much water and other resources this region can sustain."
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,ClubSoda,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:49:06 2015 UTC,To be fair Victoria for example has no water issues / no current water restrictions.
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,TechnicallyITsCoffee,12,Mon Jul 6 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - we are now facing level 4 drought conditions. These conditions have led to low water levels in streams, rivers, and lakes. Because of these low water levels, and the increased Temperature of the water due to the heat, the fish stocks aren't doing well and as a result, to protect them, their harvest has been banned for large parts of the island.  Level 4 drought is different from Level 3 drought in a few ways:  Level 3 drought means that there is serious potential for there to be insufficient water for the ecosystem and the humans living off of it. Level 4 drought means that the potential has been reached and the water level is insufficient.  level 4 still only requires Voluntary conservation, restrictions, and controls - nobody is going to force you to do anything just yet (i'm pretty sure, i'm definitely not an expert on that sort of thing, just taking this off of the watersmart page).  The only thing past level 4 is ""Loss of Supply"", which is what happened to Tofino when they had to evacuate. No water to drink or fight fires.  One question I had when I read this was, how exactly does a low water level affect fish?  I found some answers here. Definitely not the most rigorous sourcing, but they seem legit. It's actually a combination of several factors.   High water temperatures can harm or kill the fish directly. Fish are very sensitive to temperature and salinity changes. The low flow means that there are less deep pools to shelter in during these times of high temperature - a loss of habitat the fish are waaaay easier to catch because of this loss of habitat, they all have to cluster in these deep pools to hide away and then they're easily caught all these stresses on top of the stress of being caught and released can be enough to kill the fish as well.   Silver Lining - for most of us, anyways -   residential, agricultural and industrial users within municipalities and regional districts backed by reservoir storage are less vulnerable to water supply shortages than water users served by smaller water systems from streams, lakes and wells.   All the above is fact, or I've tried to make it as factual and unbiased as I can. Below is my opinion. My opinion might be right, it might be wrong -   Climate change is becoming more and more visible, this is just one more example on the mountain of examples and evidence that has been collected and reported on in the last few decades to do with global warming and climate change. It is real, this drought is directly related to global warming from increased greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, and it's only going to get worse. I think these issues are more important than any issues ever faced by the human race. Politics, countries, borders, religions, fucking everything should be set aside to solve global warming, it's the only problem that matters in the 21st century."
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,TechnicallyITsCoffee,-2,Fri Jul 3 22:46:52 2015 UTC,If we have a big snow storm next year will that be proof that global warming isn't real?  This drought isn't likely directly caused by global warming.
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,TechnicallyITsCoffee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"extreme weather conditions are linked to global warming from anthropogenic climate change, not necessarily warm or hot conditions. Drought is an extreme weather condition. A big snow storm would be too actually, like the snowstorms experienced on the east coast this winter.   More energy being trapped by the atmosphere means more energy being input into the systems that govern the weather.   That particular argument you just used is a fairly toxic one as well. It implies that you only consider local events in your consideration of a global problem. We've enjoyed a nice temperate climate here in Victoria over the last decade, but averaged globally, we've experienced 7/10 of the warmest years on record. None of the top ten are before 1998.  This drought is caused by a lack of snowpack, which is due to an abnormally warm winter, caused by a large blob of abnormally warm air sitting over top of the pacific ocean for the majority of the season. Pretty directly linked to global warming."
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,GameAddikt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"Climate scientists and meteorologists are saying that this particular drought (referring to California, but the west coast in general) isn't likely related to global warming.  Although it is possible they don't believe it is likely.  Also based on weather patterns they think there is going to be extreme droughts in 2050 as a reoccurring pattern that happens every few hundred years.  I fully believe in climate change, just don't think you should blame individual weather events such as this on climate change.    More efforts should be made to lower the amount of water we use as that in itself can have a big impact on creating droughts.  But we should also be lowering emissions..."
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,Tweeeked,3,Mon Jul 6 04:44:02 2015 UTC,I was just about to panic about global warming and how much has changed since I was a child but I remember a summer 11-12 years ago in which we weren't allowed to waste water and you could be fined for it.  Got a scolding from a police officer for wasting water by jumping through my families sprinkler to cool down.  Don't remember ever having problems since.
VictoriaBC,3c10v9,mimetic-polyalloy,11,Sat Jul 4 01:16:26 2015 UTC,In Victoria we've actually become so good at conserving water that the CRD now has to charge us more in order to maintain normal levels of funding.

It's a beautiful walk, great views across the water. You can also detour through Beacon Hill Park. One thing you shouldn't miss is the Beacon Hill Drive-Thru on Douglas across from the park, they have the best vanilla softserve ice cream ever created."

VictoriaBC,3c16aa,robohymn,6,Sat Jul 4 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"If you are fit I would recommend hiking up Mount Doug on a clear day, it gives the best possible view of the city and the surrounding islands and has a ton of different trails of different difficulties to get to the top, plus there is a nice beach as part of the park where you can relax afterward. If you want a more challenging hike there is Mount Finlayson in Goldstream Park just outside the city, it also has a great view.  If you have a car the drive to Port Renfrew is beautiful and not too long with lots of nice stops along the way. There is a place called botanical beach in Port Renfrew where you can see some pretty amazing sea life in the tide pools (check the tide schedule and go at low tide for the best experience the hike through the woods from the parking lot can take 45 mins to an hour so take that into account) plus its near the trailhead for the Juan de Fuca trail and the forests in the area are incredible.   Hatley Castle on the west shore is pretty cool, it was built by a coal baron, turned into a military college and is now a public university. There is a beautiful garden and a huge old growth forest on the grounds with waterfalls and a bird sanctuary. It was the filming location for the mutant school in the Xmen movies and It was planned to be the new seat of the British Empire if England was successfully invaded by Germany in WWII.  If you like Beer there is the Philips Brewery downtown and a ton of nice British style pubs Like the Bard and Banker, Swans, Irish Times, the Sticky Wicket and lots more. There is a pub crawl where you take a little harbor ferry between different pubs which is fun.   Wittys Lagoon is a nice sandy beach just outside of the city. If you want to stay in the city the beaches along Dallas road are nice. Renting a bike and biking along Dallas road or checking out the galloping goose trail would be nice too."

This may be a grim reminder to put on a seat belt even when you're in a cab.  Road was closed from around 2:30 am to just after 9:30 am.

If you need 24 hour parking the parkades allow you to park there for that long but you'll need to pay when you leave. Also there is a number of unregulated streets on the other side of the bridge in Vicwest that aren't too far to walk. That would be free but not as close. There is also a private Robbins lot right by there that has extended parking. Just don't park at a metre on the street those spaces are only intended for short term parking.
VictoriaBC,3bymyp,70sJesus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:06:23 2015 UTC,Have you looked at parkades? I park under the library off of Broughton (quite a few blocks from Mermaids' Wharf so not ideal) and I've left my car there for days at a time. The security seems good and the rates are fair. It's a city parkade so rates and policy must be different than private lots and parkades.

Canadian laws don't allow restaurants to do this due to different food regulations.  I had never had a medium rare burger before and now.....now I'm no longer satisfied with local offerings.

VictoriaBC,3bntqf,VicPDCanada,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the reply. I gotta be honest and say that I haven't ventured downtown nor taken public transport on Canada Day in a couple/few years. I went downtown this year and was very impressed by both the police presence and the behavior of the crowd. There were seemingly hundreds of reserve constables on site being Mother Goosed around by actual Vic PD officers and I was neither personally harassed nor did I witness any harassment nor violation of anybodies rights (as per the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms).   Another admission: the only reason why I agreed to go into the downtown core this year is becausey wife has a fancy phone that will record onto ""the cloud"". The two of us agreed that I wouldn't ""push"" any interactions with the police and we rehearsed some of the different ways that I could resist any violations of my rights (verbally) if any encounter with a Vic PD officer was pushed upon me.   This year the Vic PD seemed to be maintaining the peace by their presence (rather than their ""force"") in the downtown core and the RCMP were the ones doing the checkstops on the perimeter.   My personal perception of this (obviously biased due to several bad experiences in the past) was this: the actual professionals were on the perimeter keeping the bad-guys out while the thugs with guns were on the inside under explicit orders to not harass anybody unless they actually see a clear violation of the law.   I wish I could say ""good job"", but that's just really how it should be... So I guess ""thanks for not being a bunch of fucking assholes (this year)"" is more in order than anything else."
VictoriaBC,3bntqf,Couchtiger23,-9,Fri Jul 3 02:19:07 2015 UTC,don't keep anything you're not allowed in your bag

VictoriaBC,3bntqf,witty_remark,2,Wed Jul 1 07:45:10 2015 UTC,Are your rights violated every time you enter a sporting event and they search you?  It happens to me every time I go to a canucks game.  They don't search your bag unless you want to enter a specific area for an event.   It is done because there have been issues in the past...  If you feel you must sneak some liquor downtown use some common sense and hide a flask on your person or fill a water bottle with some vodka.  If its a knife or something you feel you need to bring maybe stay home...  I would assume searching someone entering an event is not a breach of freedoms.  Also do they search everyone or just people they have cause to thing are carrying banned substance?  Such as drunk\young people with a backpack.
VictoriaBC,3bntqf,TechnicallyITsCoffee,3,Wed Jul 1 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Entering a private establishment? Yes, search away - walking around in public? Nope, not cool. That's my take anyway, bit then it also bothers me when I get pulled over on my bike for no reason other than being profiled because im a bike rider. Which any biker is aware of in spring. Zee documents!"
VictoriaBC,3bntqf,just_quit_smoking,3,Wed Jul 1 18:23:06 2015 UTC,I didn't think they searched except when using BC Transit.  Had not seen them searching random people walking unless those people are making a nuisance.    I saw plenty of pretty obviously under age kids fairly drunk having a good time downtown without issue.  Seems the police were fairly reasonable in response.  Mind you I left downtown around 10:45.   I hadn't heard of them confiscating liquor from a bag from adults ever except on the bus... where they clearly post ahead of time that you cannot have liquor.   Also the searches only happen because a few screwed it up for the rest of us...  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/victoria-police-planning-illegal-canada-day-searches-bccla-charges/article1374368/

Go into either of those places with a clear style in mind and I'm certain they can help you into a suit. Don't be afraid to bring in a magazine or an image off the internet to help you explain what you want, its going to help everyone to have a clear understanding of what you're looking for.

Actually, if it were due to injury that should be covered by other insurance (ICBC, WCB etc) it would not be covered. Check your specific wordings. One Blue Cross plan will not be the same as another, the employer selects a package or larger ones negotiate a particular plan (e.g. VIHA). The wordings will clearly state how often, per treatment time and what $ amount they cover per treatment (might be $60 for a 60 minute treatment max, but the particular RMT you want to visit is $80/hr, so you end up $20 out of pocket after the reimbursement).  Anyhow, I've gone to Method near Hillside and Quadra. Matt is quite professional and it's a calm clean little private studio. I pay in full then claim online.  My wife goes to Calm on Fisgard. Nice studio with a few rooms. They have a therapist that specializes in pregnant women who she visited while pregnant. My wife liked her so much she has now stayed with her for massage.

They looked like a pack of wolves on the hunt.  I googled a police scanner stream online after I heard the 3rd car go by. And most of it was just regular chatter, until at one point I heard someone give a bit of a description of who they were looking for. They said that they were on scene at a McDonalds, talking to a witness who said that a suspect ""handed the hatchet off to a girl on a skateboard who fled the scene"", and that ""she has a history of mental illness"".

VictoriaBC,3bftbq,dubbreak,0,Mon Jun 29 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"It's more of a trailer, but like it or not it is by definition and overview."
VictoriaBC,3bftbq,dubbreak,0,Mon Jun 29 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it wasn't an overview. But if you want to get technical..   Overview (n): a general explanation or description of something   What I got from this:   There is an existing system called CREST It is being upgraded and ""expanded"" (more features? Larger coverage area? Expanded is ambiguous in this context.. ergo meaningless). Upgrade is a ""p-25 standard"" (meaningless technospeak as very few people will know what p25 is.. apparently it's a TDMA voice standard) hand waving DIGITAL!   Nothing along the lines of ""this is why we need to upgrade, here are the features and benefits of an upgrade"".  Basically it did an overview of the existing system (what CREST is) but horribly failed on giving any useful information about the upgrade other than the timeline.   2 years to upgrade?! Sounds like a serious upgrade. Does it mean new handhelds in all vehicles? New infrastructure? New dispatch integration?"
VictoriaBC,3bftbq,dubbreak,2,Mon Jun 29 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"Under the definition you posted it's still an overview. Albeit a rather vague one. I guess it's meant to be more public and easy to digest than the technical details they released earlier in the year. It's sounding more like 3 years at this point, so who know how long it will actually be.     Does it mean new handhelds in all vehicles? New infrastructure? New dispatch integration?     Likely yes to all the 3 and they are currently erecting new towers.     hand waving DIGITAL!     Just you wait until we start hearing more of the ""Digital is bad for emergency services"" argument, which I would completely agree with. What actually irked me about this video was the mention of September 11th, not only was it in very poor taste but it was completely off-topic and just designed to tug at one's heartstrings."
VictoriaBC,3bftbq,ssbtech,0,Mon Jun 29 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"Again, I didn't claim it wasn't an overview in my original comment. By the definition it is a weak overview of the new system (as it really doesn't try to explain anything). Completely agree it's geared towards the general public (in a positive spin, which would make it border on propaganda, but I digress).   Just you wait until we start hearing more of the ""Digital is bad for emergency services"" argument, which I would completely agree with.   Depends on the frequency and other factors. In general I'd agree analog is more reliable for voice. It's not secure, but it is usable even when degraded.  The problem is they need data as well. You can do data over analog, but not much. The lack of bandwidth means proper error correction is difficult (eats into the small amount amount of bandwidth you have). Anyhow, digital is definitely required for the amount of data they want to be able to push and pull directly to/from emergency vehicles. Digital is also required for secure communications. Hopefully they'll have analog fallback for voice.  Off topic, but to the best of my knowledge ambulances around the province were using some kind of data over analog to send small amounts of data.. albeit unreliably.   What actually irked me about this video was the mention of September 11th, not only was it in very poor taste but it was completely off-topic and just designed to tug at one's heartstrings.   Well they aren't the first ones and won't be the last to use such techniques. Tasteless and really pushes it that much further towards being propaganda, not information. THINK OF THE CHILDREN!

There have been cases where scanner hobbyists have assisted in the capture of a suspect or have been able to broadcast areas to avoid due to crash, fire, etc...   There's no reason to secure the standard dispatch channels."
VictoriaBC,3bftbq,Bitter_Bert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"There are benefits to having your secure comms centrally controlled (e.g. logging all communication). Can't do that with cell phones. That benefit will be touted as public safety, but of course it's CYA (just like cameras on cops, good to prove they didn't beat a suspect, but good luck getting footage if they did something wrong).  Won't disagree that most communication should be public. MVA, fire and even most ambulance calls should be publicly broadcasted. There are legitimate cases where they should be private, but also available to many officers and also logged centrally (e.g. drug bust).  Are the benefits worth the cost? Doubtful.   That being said an OTS system would probably be as bad or worse than the current CREST system. Custom is pricey to build, OTS is cheap to buy, but expensive and difficult (if not impossible) to integrate. Software/IT projects of this size are prone to failure and essentially by rule are over budget and not on schedule. Here's a link if you are interested in the plethora of studies showing how badly IT projects go..."

VictoriaBC,3bb7ie,rxm2015,3,Sat Jun 27 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hi quiettime,  For people who are new to swing dancing, I recommend coming to try out the drop-in beginner lesson that we teach at the start of our weekly Friday night dance.  It's meant for people who have never danced before to get a fun and easy introduction to swing dancing, so you need neither a partner nor dance experience to give it a whirl!  We have a huge, gorgeous space with air conditioning, which makes a big difference when you're dancing during these hot summer months.  There's also a large enough crowd that you can blend in easily - a nice feature while you're learning your first steps.  We've been running Red Hot Swing for eleven years and teaching for even longer, so you'll get the benefit of the most experienced and the only professional lindy hop instructors in Victoria.  If you enjoy yourself at our dance on Friday night, you can expand your dance vocabulary in our series of progressive classes.  They start up regularly, with the next Swing 1 session (our beginner track) set to begin on Thursday July 9th at 8pm.  If you'd like more information about any of this, feel free to give me a shout: (250) 885-4639.  I hope this helps! :) -Kevin"

VictoriaBC,3bank0,ehManiacal,5,Sat Jun 27 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Every November there is a big charity game stream put on by the Loading Ready Run guys in Victoria which is pretty big. It also raises money for Child's Play and last year they raised $640,000 after 6 days and 14 hours of streaming. They make it extremely entertaining and the focus has been less and less on the most boring video game (Desertbus) they are playing and more on all the other antics, auctions and things they do to raise donations.  https://desertbus.org/  There is also Awesome Games Done Quick which streams live speed runs of games for charity donations which is pretty big too (I don't know how much they raise though as I'm not aprticularly interested in speed running). https://gamesdonequick.com/  There have been a number of smaller ones (like the one OP is posting about), sometimes focused on one game or a variety of them but I've never really watched those. Hard to compete with the amount of effort that goes into Desertbus."

We take precautions to make sure that he doesn't get carried away. If this woman thought her dog was hurting/had hurt your dog, she should have apologized,given you her name and contact number,  leashed her dog, and left the park. I'm so sorry this happened to you.

Probably was at least somewhat my fault, was a couple month old great dane.  my dog and my friends dog ran up and started sniffing it and it kinda stuck its tail between its leg.  Then a third dog ran up kind of behind it and the little guy panicked and bit my dog on the face and then ran away.  My dog chased it around kind of aggressively after he got bit, I didn't see him get bit at first and wondered why he went nuts.    In the end nothing too bad but I have learned to make sure if a dog looks uncomfortable I keep my dog away from it :p (which shouldn't really be a lesson I needed, but a few hundred dollars to the vet got the point across :()  There is always some risk to the dog park but in 6-7 years going to the dog park I have only had a couple incidents and 2 stitches was the worst of it."

VictoriaBC,3b8ibt,Elliot82,0,Sat Jun 27 15:44:36 2015 UTC,Dallas Road from the end of Ross Bay Cemetery all the way to the Ogden Pt breakwater and back is 8km. Add another km if you do the breakwater loop. That is definitely a good stretch (unless you're a distance runner). If you want to avoid the off-leash area you have to make a detour.

VictoriaBC,3b5e5t,DforDrew,2,Mon Jun 29 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I have my baby nymphs in a terrarium. We have a LOT of them, so I'll keep a couple as pets and release the rest into my garden.  Basically, we have an glass tank with a mesh lid. It's full of branches for the babies to climb on. I feed them flightless fruit flies (you can buy a colony of fruit flies at the Bug Zoo downtown). Since you'd only have a couple of babies you'd probably be fine carching fruit flies to feed to your mantises. When they're a bit bigger, give them ants, etc.  They are tiny, so they'll drown in water. I have a little water dish with a wet paper towel in it for them to drink from. You can also use a wet sponge.  Is some infomation on mantis care.  I'll be home tonight after 7:30 if you'd like to come pick a couple up. If that doesn't work we can figure out another time, let me know.  Katie."

The very next day, I caught the guy downtown with my bike.  I managed to get my bike back, plus I managed to hold on to the guy until I could get someone to get the police show up. They took him away.  I called insurance & let them know what happened & dropped my claim.  A week later, my insurance was up for renewal & they wouldn't renew it.  ""We don't insure people who make claims"".    Aside from ""Isn't that what insurance is for??!!"", I'm clearly a trustworthy person - I made a claim, then called them & told them I recovered my bike.  I'm exactly the client they WANT.  I know a lot of people who never would have made that second call.  What's the lesson from this?  Don't get your bike stolen?"

VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,bugcrusher,5,Thu Jun 25 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  My commuting bike was stolen from Fairfield last March.   I reported it the same day, had one possible candidate bike callback about 2 weeks later, but it was determined not to be mine.  I am the sole bread winner in my house, and haven't been able to replace it, so that sucks. Here's my comments.   The website I filled out my stolen bike report on was pretty good.  I score it 8/10. The officer who I spoke to was also great. I think there should be a permanent website, like dropbox or something, open to everyone where you put all photos of recovered bikes.  Just the photos.  No need to hire a web developer, just drop the photos into the dropbox site, you can hook this up automatically with any modern mobile phone.  Until today I had no idea you posted to Used Victoria and Pinterest, 2 sites I NEVER go to.  Poor communication there. 2/10. Do you have information on the auction? At least this would have been an opportunity for me to see what bikes you had recovered, and see if mine was there.  Can you hold the auction more frequently? The bike auction would also probably be the only place I can afford a new bike right now.  My wife says I'm getting fatter.   Take these comments as constructive criticism.  Like you, I just want to see bikes returned to their owners. Edit:Line breaks"
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,bugcrusher,2,Thu Jun 25 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a dropbox, or something more web-based. When we initially went with Pinterest you didn't have to have an account to view it (2012) but it, and the UsedVictoria were in the news and routinely on Twitter / FB (admittedly not on reddit). We don't do the auctions, as the bikes go to bc auctions (www.bcauction.ca) for sales. Hope that hit all the points. Thanks for the feedback."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,2,Thu Jun 25 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. Dropbox is free, and takes minutes to set up, and can be open to the world, without nagging for a login the way the pinterest site does.  Secondly, go to the vicpd site.  Type in ""auction"" in to the search, and you'll get no returns.  I suggest you take your post from above, edit a bit, add a section with links to the auction site, and then add it to the site.  Then you won't have people like me saying they don't know about the stolen bike intake, the investigative process, where to look for it, what to expect or the auction.  You folks provide a service, and educating the public on that service is likely why you're taking to social media, but cover the obvious bases too."

VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,GrumpaDirt,4,Thu Jun 25 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Was just coming in to talk about that :) VicPD was great. I only had the bike make, model, colour and some of the accessories to tell them about but /u/vicpd gave me Constable Millards contact info when they think they found my bike less than 24 hours later. I made the post and the same day they had my bike at vicpd headquarters. And I did all the right things. I live at the end of a cul de sac and then on a pan handled private drive way and my bike was locked up behind my house on my deck with a very sturdy lock but the thief just busted the deck post and ran off with the bike.  Shit happens, especially in Victoria when it comes to bikes because we are a very bike friendly community and so they are in high demand and there are plenty of opportunities."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,RalphHinkley,17,Thu Jun 25 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, so my friend was at Target on Hillside at the mall, and has her bike trailer (trailer for kids) stolen. She had a cart full of groceries and several kids with her. The theft was on camera and the thief was supposed to be known in the area. She called you guys, and waited  an hour for someone to show up and take her statement. After an hour she was called and told nobody could make it out. She juggled a cart, bicycle, and children home, and waited for help. When nobody contacted her again she called the dept. and was told the officer in charge of her case was on vacation and to leave a message. Never heard back. Has photos, video of the theft, etc etc and nothing. Explain that one. This was last year and she has since bought a new trailer and no longer requires your help but still, explain that."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,16,Thu Jun 25 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a mess up on our part. Maybe not the 'being there immediately' as I don't know what was occurring in the city at that time, but there should have been follow up to it. I'm sorry that didn't happen."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Shawn68z,4,Thu Jun 25 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. It's nice to be heard and get a reply. I won't pretend you guys are horrible, I know VicPD does a lot of good in the community, however I have witnessed a few crummy moments, and experienced a couple myself. I'm baffled that a police bicycle wouldn't have some sort of tracking chip.   Good luck in your search."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,3,Fri Jun 26 02:19:21 2015 UTC,If they didn't make mistakes we'd have to get them checked to make sure they are still real humans. It's good that people stay on issues too because that's how organizations like this learn to find/fix loopholes where mistakes can occur.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Shawn68z,2,Fri Jun 26 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Chappie police wouldn't be so bad :)"
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,2,Fri Jun 26 05:28:34 2015 UTC,"I can explain that one. Was anyone in immediate danger? No.  Is evidence going to be lost/destroyed if the arrival is delayed? No. Its on film, stolen by a known thief.   Its just property. Sucks when it gets stolen or damaged, but thats why we have insurance."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,ehManiacal,5,Thu Jun 25 22:12:39 2015 UTC,Nice try. Insurance for bicycles is rare and incomplete in Canada. No way they would cover a trailer for anyone who is just a renter.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Shawn68z,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:29:32 2015 UTC,Renters should have insurance. If they don't then that's their own stupidity.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,5,Fri Jun 26 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Renter's insurance (called tenant insurance) seldom applies to bicycles, and the bicycle in question needs to have a high value. BCAA for example requires it to be valued at more than $1000, which means a trailer is not covered.  The only stupidity here is your lack of insight into a problem you speak so judgmentally on."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Shawn68z,2,Sat Jun 27 00:34:20 2015 UTC,Which they don't evne offer to people who aren't families or older adults in a relationship. I asked about it once as Megson Fitzpatrick and might as well have been laughed at and told to fuck off from the way the woman there replied.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,jibini,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"My insurance covers my bikes just fine. Even when I had Renters insurance.    And I agree that the bike or  property needs to be a high value to make claiming on insurance worth while.   Having property stolen sucks, but to expect the police to magically drop whatever they are doing for a trailer that you admit has little value, is ridiculous.   No person was hurt, or in danger.  File a report and move on."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Shawn68z,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"The issue was that the police failed to follow up on the report. The hurt was that the trailer could not easily be replaced and that its missing made getting home with kids really difficult. The police dropped the ball on this one, that is the core issue."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,CE2JRH,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:51:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. The police should have followed upon the report at some point in the future. Would it ha be changed anything? Not likely.

VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,thenaughtyfile,2,Sun Jun 28 17:45:10 2015 UTC,It's basically impossible in BC for numerous (4+) unrelated people living together to get tenants insurance. That rules out a large segment of renters.

Are there many instances where all the pertinent information is received, however the item is never recovered?  I submitted a report many months ago, however my bike has not yet turned up. I am still hopeful though. Thank you VicPD for your continued assistance and active social media team."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,evade16,2,Sun Jun 28 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"We're up to about 150 of 370 (reported) stolen bikes being returned this year so far, so chances are good. The more info the better, but if you don't have a ton, even make and model helps us search."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,-4,Mon Jun 29 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"This answer seems to avoid the question put forth by /u/mr_unhelpful:     Can someone explain to me why the Victoria Police are prioritizing their stolen bike over all other stolen bikes?     Sure, it's a bit of snap judgement to say Victoria Police prioritized themselves over others. But there's no denying that the way this was handled on social media could be perceived as such.    One could argue that the social media posts alone don't actually expend that many resources. But what, aside from personal, made this worth posting over all the other stolen bikes and other property out there? It doesn't stop at interests of a personal matter. The real issue isn't just this specific stolen bike, but rather why are some stolen goods, lost pets (that fucking snake), etc. taking priority on social media over other identical cases?"
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,evade16,4,Thu Jun 25 19:01:36 2015 UTC,Would you criticize any other bike owner this much after posting it to reddit or other social media? In this case vicpd is the owner of a stolen bike and posting it here with the information that they have. They do happen to be the same people that investigate other stolen bikes so it may seem different but they are still the owner of a stolen bike here.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,evade16,-5,Thu Jun 25 23:19:13 2015 UTC,Terrible comparison. As I've mentioned over and over this isn't simply the matter of one stolen bike.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,10,Thu Jun 25 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"The social media push for this was admittedly heavy, but we have done similar pushes (and very recently) for other stolen bikes. There are a couple factors that dictate how much we can get out and how fast. First is time delay. If an investigator gets us the information quickly and with a picture it helps us get the information out in a timely manner and lets it be shared. The other factor that plays into that is the availability of someone to actually post that information. We are here as a resource on dayshift, but after we're gone (as you may have noticed) there's not a lot of social media activity. I can firmly state that we actually had more officers out looking for prolific bike thieves than our bike. As for what 'makes it' or not onto our social we weigh a few factors. The first is public safety (ie: snake with a bad bite) and the second is what information is provided to us. Hope that helps clarify."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,evade16,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:48:31 2015 UTC,I would also say that people here if their bike is stolen would have made the post here already anyways and so VicPD doubling up is a little unnecessary plus if VicPD posted every stolen bike report that is all this subreddit would be...
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"This goes beyond the scope of reddit, though. Criticism of their handling of this specific bike theft came from all over. Nobody expects every. single. theft. to be shared over social media. What people want to know is how it's prioritized."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,2,Thu Jun 25 20:20:19 2015 UTC,the police use public sightings to help find stolen property that is the publics. why can't they leverage the same ability to help find their own stolen property? I haven't had many bikes stolen but 100% of the ones that have been have been spotted by somebody who saw an alert and reported it to the police. Its not as though they put VIMCU on the case...
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,diejetty,-2,Thu Jun 25 20:25:39 2015 UTC,why can't they leverage the same ability to help find their own stolen property?     For starters the media push for this was much heavier than other cases. This situation was no doubt more of a catalyst than anything. Criticism of VicPD's handling of this case brings forth the question of how and why their social media is handled.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,lavaslippers,8,Thu Jun 25 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"All I am hearing from complainers is that when VicPD has positive results from their social media actions or they update reddit posts with the found missing person or snake recently they are met with praise but ""damn them for posting something of theirs that was stolen damn them all."""
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,4,Thu Jun 25 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"they made a post on reddit and a post on their facebook just like they do for other crimes in the area. the snake, missing people, bank robberies."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,rgsteele,-2,Thu Jun 25 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"What's your point? First off, it was much farther reaching that reddit and facebook. Second, /u/vicpdcanada admitted this push on this one was heavy."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,diejetty,2,Thu Jun 25 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"sending out a little extra social media effort takes essentially no extra effort. could vicpd do this for other cases, sure, but they don't because it would swamp everything. plus its our tax dollars that bought that bike. why shouldn't we be concerned that it gets found."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,XavierWoodshed,-3,Thu Jun 25 21:04:20 2015 UTC,I fully understand what you're saying and agree with you. Trust me. But as I've said in other comments it's not as simple as this one case.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,clarkster,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"Let's play out a scenario. You're at the office, with nothing restricting you from making a media release. My bikes gets stolen. Information gets to an investigator right away. They know where it was stolen from, they have an accurate description of the soc, there's surveilance footage, and I've provided them with recent photos of the bike and serial #s. They pass this information onto you. I'm guaranteed to have that information spread via VicPDCanada over social media?"
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Jimmy6shoes,2,Thu Jun 25 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"Is it extremely likely, absolutely, but I can't 'guarantee' a theoretical situation."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,Jimmy6shoes,12,Thu Jun 25 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'll say what vicpd can't. Their bike is more important than yours. Period. This bike gets an officer on scene to deal with police business. If you lost a bike and had to carry groceries home, that sucks, but you lived.  This bike could have been the difference between an officer showing up late or early to help you.  Everyone in this town is so quick to dump on the police but I don't see anyone here signing up to be a cop. Its a thankless job. Just be thankful someone did step up to protect you.   Let the downvotes rain upon me."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,nrtphotos,4,Thu Jun 25 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Plus, if they find the thief, it very well may lead to other bikes and or thieves."
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,wearecode,-3,Fri Jun 26 05:22:58 2015 UTC,You're pretending like this is a one time thing when it isn't. /u/VicPDCanada's social media presence has been very questionable at times. It just so happens this gave people an opening to discuss how they feel about it.
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,GrumpaDirt,6,Thu Jun 25 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""questionable""? I fail to see how VicPD's social media presence has been anything but positive. It's not like they are just blasting out press releases -- they actually engage with us, and it's clear that the people managing the accounts don't have to run their responses by a committee or anything.   What would you change? Do you think VicPD shouldn't have posted about their stolen bike? If they didn't, wouldn't people argue that they were trying to hide the theft from the public?"
VictoriaBC,3b3d5r,wearecode,2,Thu Jun 25 22:40:09 2015 UTC,I'm not pretending about anything. Its just a hard fact. Their bike and property are worth more than yours. This is me discussing openly. Most people in here have pitchforks in hand.

VictoriaBC,3b3orf,Tweeeked,8,Thu Jun 25 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"This makes literally no sense at all.  They had two options:  1) Host it at the Panorama which won the competition, and if they can't do that then;  2) Host it at the best available venue in the city.  Which is the Save on Arena.  Since they already decided they can't have it at the Panorama then there is no reason not to host it at Save On."
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,vrnate,4,Thu Jun 25 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Seems like a weird choice. Not only is it fairly far from North Saanich, but it has 2781 seats compared to Save-on-Foods Arena which has 7006 seats."
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,XavierWoodshed,6,Thu Jun 25 18:35:44 2015 UTC,I wonder why they chose The Q Centre (approx. 2781 seats) over Save-On Foods Arena (approx. 7400 seats). Cost or scheduling conflict? Save-On seemed like a no-brainer given this is a guaranteed sell out.
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,clevernothings,5,Thu Jun 25 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"I also think the idea of the whole contest is to provide arena improvements and hockey promotion in smaller towns.

VictoriaBC,3b3orf,XavierWoodshed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. I'm also wondering if it has to do with some deal they've struck with The Q. I know The Zone does radio coverage for the Royals, so maybe that's been extending to them for this game."
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,jordoonearth,2,Thu Jun 25 21:03:46 2015 UTC,If they're trying to sell this to the rest of Canada as if its happening in Panorama Centre - Maybe it's part of the smoke and mirrors of showbiz to have the game in a smaller and less equipped arena.
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,XavierWoodshed,2,Thu Jun 25 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, they won't be selling it as such. It's made very clearly that if the facility isn't appropriate another nearby will suffice."
VictoriaBC,3b3orf,jordoonearth,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm out of ideas then. Dumb choice."

VictoriaBC,3b3orf,XavierWoodshed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:58:11 2015 UTC,Different type of crowd I'd imagine. You'd also being seeing a lot more people coming from outside the city than you would for a Royals game.

If they don't, a new one isn't far away.   What would you like us to do? Offer you the same bullshit advice you give us when something of low value is stolen? Did you leave it in a well lit area? Did you use a good quality lock? Did you take pictures and record the serial number?  See how that doesn't help? How you're kind of offended I even mentioned it? Yeah. We feel the same thing when you say it to us.  I'm just surprised that the same department who couldn't be bothered to even show up when most bikes are reported stolen would expect the public to assist in recovering one of their own bikes from the same crackheads we live with every day.

The owner of the bike saw and ran outside to confront the thief... who then had the gigantic cojones to proceed to lecture the owner about leaving his bike locked up where it could be stolen. And then the thief rode away scot-free on the BMX. With the boltcutters. And the whole time the security guard did nothing.  Riding my bike is now an end unto itself for me.

For toilets it's just outhouses.    I'm not sure about going by bicycle, but it was maybe a 10 minute drive from the ferry to pulling into a parking spot at the group sites, so it might not be a massive inconvenience to leave the site for laundry if necessary.

The area was closed for car-free day so you're not even paying for traffic control either."

There were at leat 3 people on the team as you can see on the video, there were 9 empty 5 gal paint buckets. and one large truck in the middle of the intersection. There was caution tape all around and it wasn't closed to traffic when they did it - I wasn't there but there are parked cars all around the caution tape.  DOes it cost money to permit the closure of the street? They had to mask and paint 7 colours on each cross walk. Also there was the planning, approval, design, reports to convince stakeholders, logistics, scheduling and maybe breaks too.  I think it might take longer than 4 hours each too because of the complexity of the colours. But what do i know?"
VictoriaBC,3avk08,murfburffle,9,Tue Jun 23 23:29:55 2015 UTC,"Chek News said they did it while the roads were closed for car free day.

I wouldn't call one post on Reddit a lot of resources, especially considering it's presumably by an officer who's job already includes monitoring social media and engaging with the public.  It's the same as anyone else would do for their own bike if it were stolen.

Do you know for a fact that officers are assigned to the case and are actively following up on leads? All I'm sure of at present is that the vicpd social media staffer is actively discussing the issue on social media but I have to confess that this seems to be his primary function with the PD and thus I don't want to be too quick to assume that just because he's posting about the bike on reddit that there is a squad car of officers driving around trying to track down this bike when there are quite certainly better things they could be doing.  If it is a fact that they are actively pursuing this investigation with resources that they would not afford a similar case from another owner, then it would sure seem to me (as a random civilian and not a lawyer or anything remotely close to it) that this is a misappropriation of public resources."

VictoriaBC,3b08vg,GiBear,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"As far as overall manpower/resources are concerned it's hard to say how much they are actually prioritizing this over other lost/stolen items. However there's no denying that as far as social media is concern this has certainly been received a high priority. Sure, there's far too many stolen bikes for them to post on social media about each one, but since it's one of their own this is getting special treatment. Which is questionable. That being said, it's not uncommon for people to post lost/stolen items here and nobody questions it. edit: not trying to steer off topic, but the quality of VicPD's social media presence becomes very inconsistent at times and when it does it never goes unnoticed. It's also worth keeping in mind other items that seem to take priority such as that lost snake, when there's plenty of other missing pets out there. And that wasn't a police-issue snake. And nobody was crying foul on that."

VictoriaBC,3ayclj,velowallah,6,Wed Jun 24 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"The city that you seem to want (multicultural, vibrant arts scene, lots of asian restaurants) is Vancouver, not Victoria. Vancouver has much better venues for music. Victoria lacks a place for concerts from 300-800 people. Asian restaurants here tend to sell 'western' Asian food, there is much more variety and authenticity in Vancouver for that. All of the public transit here focuses on the actual city, in Vancouver transit is designed to take people to all of the suburbs and transportation hubs (airport and ferry). Cycling is common here, but Vancouver has much more of a bicycle scene.  Of the two I prefer Victoria, but based on what you said you are looking for, Vancouver sounds like a much better destination. If you are going to move thousands of kms you should find what you want."

VictoriaBC,3ayclj,aboba_,3,Wed Jun 24 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"Both Ottawa and Victoria are government/univeristy/tourist cities which hugely influences their culture. I found more similarities than differences.  Victoria is much smaller and geographically isolated which causes a few problems.   Daytrips to bigger cities like Vancouver/Seattle are costly  Bands counting their pennies may skip the island due to ferry costs Victoria shuts down more during the winter months   As to your specific issues:   Restaurants? There is plenty of good food here. Car free / Cycling? Good if you live in the city. BC Transit is decent, but the schedule is spotty. Lots of people cycle. Cycle paths can be spotty, but are getting better. Maps exist. Multicultural? Mostly white, but welcoming. Several community associations exist for various cultures.  Friendlyness? Sure. Just make the effort to get out and meet people. Use meetup.com."
VictoriaBC,3ayclj,swabbie,3,Wed Jun 24 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Just moved to Ottawa last year after 10 years in Victoria.   Victoria is better IMHO. It's cleaner, greener and more grassroots than Ottawa. There are only a few disadvantages:   car free living - Vic transit isnt as good. Recreational bike paths are good, but urban bike corridors aren't as well developed. Still adequate though. music - there are some good locals, but most a lot of the talent finds more opportunity in Vanc. major events - I've been to more pro-sports games and concerts in 10 months in Ottawa than the last 10 years in Vic.   What Vic has that's far superior:   weather - seems minor, but biking, hiking, paddling 12 months a year is a huge lifestyle advantage. the ocean!! - miss it terribly micro brew - The Ontario scene is up and coming, but the craft beer and brew pub culture in Vic is second only to Portland IMNSHO.   If I had the option, I'd make the move back in a second."
VictoriaBC,3ayclj,loteknik,3,Wed Jun 24 16:25:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in & around Ottawa for 20 years and Victoria for 20 years.  If you discount the size, the ""feel"" of the cities is very similar.  There is more diversity (and culture) in Ottawa, but in Victoria it's more visible.  They are both clean cities, and lots of tourists.  Both government towns.  Here is what I would consider to be the biggest difference:  In Ottawa, you are close to other large cities & you can drive & see a LOT of different things.  In the 500KM surrounding Ottawa, there are endless things to see & do.  In Victoria, It's tough to really get off the island for a short period of time because you have to take a ferry (money and lots of time).  BUT, there is rainforest, mountains, beaches, endless coastline, lots of amazing camping and hiking all very close.  So, if you like the outdoors & like to stay fairly close to home, Victoria is for you.   If you like to do lots of DIFFERENT things & like to get away, Ottawa is for you."
VictoriaBC,3ayclj,mactac,3,Wed Jun 24 17:57:54 2015 UTC,You just described Victoria. But at least we got the ocean.
VictoriaBC,3ayclj,diejetty,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"Ottawa and Victoria are very similar. Both have decent local arts scenes that can be intimidating to outsiders. We get slightly fewer out of town bands playing in Victoria, and if you are going to Vancouver for a show you are going to need a place to stay for at least one night.  We have good food, but there is more variety in the restaurants in Ottawa. Neither city has great asian food.   Both cities are good for cycling and have tons of bike paths. As far as biking on roads, Ottawa is killing it with well thought out infrastructure and safe bike lanes. Victoria makes up for that with mostly snow free winters.   I never wanted a car while living in Ottawa. Everything I wanted to visit was easily accessible with public transportation. I find making it farther up the island, even just a couple hours, a huge chore without a car.  I guess Victoria is a bit less ""conservative and straight"" but that's hard to quantify. A lot of Victoria has the same rich hippie feel of the Glebe.   Victoria is really beautiful and has a lot to offer, but I think you would be better off moving to a larger city."

Oh, and of course Victoria blows almost any other city away in terms of cycling."
VictoriaBC,3ayclj,Sasken,2,Wed Jun 24 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty okay Asian food scene here. I mean, if you want Asian food you go to Vancouver or Richmond. The mall food courts at Aberdeen Mall or Yaohan are amazing in terms of quality and variety.  Back in Victoria, thanks to a large number of EFL students there are some great Korean restaurants. Japanese restaurants are a little more iffy (but still pretty good) mostly because the people running them aren't Japanese. But in terms of Japanese restaurants there are couple of gems, and there's also an organic farm in Metchosin that grows Japanese vegetables. There's also Fujiya, a great store for buying ready-to-eat sushi, and staples of Japanese cooking.  Fujiya is near the University of Victoria in East Saanich. A lot of Asian folks have settled up there, so basically all of northern Shelbourne street has some great restaurants with authentic food, plus two Fairways Markets. Fairways has great Asian staples, including vegetables, and it's cheaper than the Thrify's or Save-On chains.  Back in downtown Victoria, Chinatown is mostly Cantonese food, and there are also a couple of great Dim Sum restaurants. But it's not like Vancouver.  There used to be a Filipino restaurant but it closed earlier this year. Mama Rosie's is a Filipino food truck, and there is also a Filipino cultural association that offers meals on Friday evenings.  There are also a ton of Pho restaurants in Victoria.  And Richmond is just a ferry trip away. Amazing food there."

VictoriaBC,3ayclj,beboe_lv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"so called ""asian food"" is better in Ottawa.  Ottawa is dominated by quite good pho (Victoria's pho sucks balls, in comparison) and for some reason is home to a decent selection of Hong Kong style restaurants. Victoria's Chinatown is quite lame with very few decent food options.  I'd wager that Indian food is even better in Ottawa than Victoria, although there are a few great spots. Concerning ""asian food"" Victoria's Japanese food trumps Ottawa, hands down.    Victoria's music scene is small and insular, but there are great underground bands.  A lot of bands bypass the city for neighboring Seattle and Vancouver, because it is not a major hub and it is expensive to get to. Although when the planets align just so, Victoria does host some fantastic acts (Acid Mother's Temple.  Sun Araw... etc).  Bicycling is great all year round as the climate is very forgiving.  I cycled everyday from January until the end of March (threw my back out).  The scenery is fantastic which makes cycling that much more enjoyable.  Unfortunately the city is very much at the mercy of terrible motorists and dumn fuck cyclists who use the sidewalk and go (in bike-lanes) the wrong way down 1-way streets.  As far as multiculturalism, Victoria is very euro-centric white but open.  The university is quite diverse.    Leave that crusty shithole and move to Victoria.  There's mountains AND an ocean."

I also lived in Vancouver for a year before coming to Victoria.   I LOVE Victoria. It's got a similar feel to Ottawa with respect to it being a government town, but there's so much more to do here, especially if you enjoy the outdoors (beaches, hiking, camping, surfing (only an hour a away), biking, walking, the ocean, the trees... you get it...)   Food and beer here is excellent, albeit more expensive than Ottawa (almost everything here is more expensive than Ottawa, especially housing, from my experience anyway).   Public transportation sucks, but if you have a car it's easy to get around the island and a bike is a great way to commute in Vic. Lots of bike lanes and trails, it's a very bike-friendly city.   In terms of size, it feels a lot smaller than Ottawa to me, but I like that. More of a community vibe to it (I live in Fernwood and I love it).   The people are great, although I do find the younger crowds here very ""clicky"". It's been hard to make friends, but I've met a wonderful woman and my coworkers are fantastic.   In terms of art, I can only really speak for the music scene. It's decent. A lot of ""indie"" bands that play in clubs and dive bars. It's starting to pick up now, although the winter was tough as everything seems to shut down pretty early here.   Anyways, I could go on, but I love Vic. The weather is amazing and it has to be, by far, the most beautiful city I've ever lived in. Culture, history, the outdoors and community is how I'd describe it in a few words.

There are great restaurants in Victoria with a strong focus on super local, fresh, amazing flavors and with such a crazily long growing season here it really is pretty amazing. I have to disagree about the Ottawa food scene (I was a chef there for years so I may be biased) but I think the food scene there has grown in leaps and bounds in the last few years... that being said it could grow a little more lol. One of the amazing things is in Victoria there really is no winter (at least not the way you get it in Ottawa by a LONG shot)  I love it here. more affordable than Vancouver, more relaxed, gorgeous."

VictoriaBC,3asuov,magmazing,0,Tue Jun 23 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of work with Custom Colour Professional Labs out of Vancouver -- they're the parent company, if you want to call it that, of the Lens and Shutter retail outlet across BC, so if you absolutely need to talk to a person, L&S is a good place to start.  I was quite happy with their services: they were responsive, easy to communicate with, and fairly priced given the quality of their product.  (I would not call them cheap.)  Sending them film originals, they never damaged a slide or a negative and often sent stuff back packed better than I shipped it. When I wasn't happy, they worked hard to try and fix whatever problem I had, and that's about all you can ask for in a lab. Having a good relationship was probably more important in the film days, especially when you needed someone to work with you on a complex B&W print, and Custom was more than happy to indulge me on that, so I like them.   When I didn't want to ship originals and work locally instead, I had fairly good results working with Prism.  Their giclee printing is excellent, maybe better than some of the on-line-only specialists, and their standard printing prices aren't awful. I don't know who does their printing -- whether they send them out, do them in-house or what. I never asked them for anything complicated, though, so I can't speak to much more than basic digital prints and the aforementioned giclee stuff.   A friend of mine who is a professional wedding photographer here in town (who shall remain nameless at her request) says that most of the printing she does is through London Drugs.  It's hard to argue with the logic: the price is right, the product is pretty good, and you can't beat the convenience.    I cannot, however, honestly say that I had dramatically better results from any one of these providers than the others.  You'll probably spend way more on framing anyway, so don't get too hung up on who does your printing."

VictoriaBC,3aocfq,dubbreak,3,Wed Jun 24 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"The ""village"" is pretty clean now. It used to be comparable to the crap that spawns up in small towns built up around a highway (e.g. kelowna is a huge mess by comparison, or any little town I've driven through in California).  Canwest is no worse than any other mall. Tillicum or mayfair arent any better aesthetically. It's not a strip mall. Try driving through Florida some time if you want to see some true strip malls. Sketchy as can be. Closest we have is the old building where Mr tubbs is (near Tillicum). It's missing some key ingredients though. It is a strip and has a bingo hall (which is key), but it needs boarded up windows, day glow sales signs, a dollar store, some hole in the wall food joints (as in sketchier than sabri's) and resident meth heads. Laundry mat optional. In Florida or Cali there would probably be a fly by night window tint place. Interior BC you can substitute a tiny dingy bowling alley for the bingo joint.  Langford has cleaned up a lot since the 90s. I wouldn't live there, but that's for other reasons. I used to work in Langford. The commute out there was great. Fly along at full highway speeds past people sitting bumper to bumper trying to get into town."

I can honestly say that there is no other place in Canada I would rather live. There are parks and ocean within a few minutes of anywhere. There are music, arts and food festivals throughout the year. We have tons of restaurants that serve a variety of different foods, quite a few of which have been featured on You Gotta Eat Here.  As for specific places to visit? Climb Mt Finlayson. Go visit the trestle bridge (opposite side of the road from Mt Finlayson). Go to Sooke Potholes for a dip. Visit East Sooke Park for a nice hike. Swim in one of several lakes. Go to Rock the Shores in July (Whoops! Just noticed you won't be here until end of July. Then I suggest Rifflandia in September as a great local music festival to attend.). Have several samples of craft beer at the Great Canadian Beer Fest in September. Go to Hecklers comedy club on Friday or Saturday night, or attend one of several amateur shows. Go watch the many talented buskers on the Cosway downtown on Government St. There's a petting zoo in Beacon Hill Park, and speaking of Beacon Hill Park, go to Beacon Hill Park. Beautiful flowers and shade a few minutes walk from downtown. Then get an ice cream cone at Beacon Drive-In.  Sheesh! I don't even work in tourism, haha. There's lots to do and see, and I'm sure you'll find lots to love and do. Welcome to the island."

Canoe, SUP and kayak rentals in Sooke basin, by Brentwood Bay, Sidney or Downtown in the Gorge are all easily found and all delightful. The hiking is really extensive, and there's a ton of excellent trails throughout the region.  Summer festivals in Victoria are pretty great, there's always stuff happening downtown, Saanich or the West Shore every weekend in the summer.   In the fall, check out salmon spawning in Goldstream Park, as it's really pretty amazing stuff.  Foodwise -- Compared to Calgary: Beer is definitely better; Chinese food is worse.

VictoriaBC,3aocfq,aboba_,0,Mon Jun 22 09:48:12 2015 UTC,"Except it doesn't suck, it's a perfectly fine place to live. It's safe, has all the non-clothing stores you need and even has some good restaurants."

VictoriaBC,3aocfq,aboba_,5,Mon Jun 22 14:25:02 2015 UTC,My ex lived in Langford and worked downtown - if you start work at 7 then it really does take only 15 minutes.
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,danma,3,Mon Jun 22 16:40:55 2015 UTC,You're thinking of Sooke or deep Colwood. Langford isn't too bad.
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,mr_burrito,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know anyone in Langford with an hour long commute, mine is 35 minutes. Without traffic, it's still over 20."
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,the_hardest_part,5,Mon Jun 22 14:29:47 2015 UTC,I've certainly waited in rush hour traffic for upwards of an hour to get into town.
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,DRAWKWARD79,3,Mon Jun 22 14:51:37 2015 UTC,Maybe if there is an accident or bad weather at peak times. I commute from behind Costco area to Hillside Mall area (via douglas and hillside) every day in ~35 minutes arriving around 8:30am. I think most people make the commute out to be worse than it really is or only remember bad days.
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,ImOnTheWeed,4,Mon Jun 22 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"Before I moved out here I lived in Toronto and had to take public transit to the heart of the city back to the outskirts.  It took me 1.5 hrs to get back home and it wouldn't have been much better by car with all the stress.  Being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic sucks and I'd rather avoid that even if I'm ""used to it"""
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,moral_mercenary,3,Mon Jun 22 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"As long as you can afford to live in town, go ahead. If you are buying a house though, unless you are very well off, you will be looking further out. Our housing isn't quite as bad as Vancouver, but it's not good either. 900k+ for a 4 bedroom home (something built in the last 30 years) is quite common in the areas closer to ""town."""
VictoriaBC,3aocfq,VicRobTheGob,3,Mon Jun 22 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"I also agree that Langford isn't a bad spot at all. I agree that the west shore commute kind of sucks (comparatively to the rest of the region)  but it makes up for it in proximity to some of the best hiking in the region, lots of great outdoors activities and recreational facilities (especially if you have kids) and as much as everyone seems to complain about it, Langford is overrun on the weekends by Victoria, Saanich and Oak Bay folks who have an insatiable lust for Superstore and Costco.  As someone who moved from Calgary out to Langford, I quickly discovered that the concept of distance is different out here..."

Edit: The page I linked leads to info for for the YVR -> Victoria route including the schedule"
VictoriaBC,3aoiwt,Munnoaster,2,Mon Jun 22 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. Public transit is feasible but to be honest, it's pretty uncomfortable with luggage. If travelling during peak times, it is crowded and no fun at all."

VictoriaBC,3aoiwt,tobiascaden,4,Mon Jun 22 14:31:23 2015 UTC,Harbour Air from YVR South Terminal river landing to downtown Victoria via float plane. Fast but will cost a bit. Also luggage weight is limited. This would be the luxury option if work is paying for the trip.
VictoriaBC,3aoiwt,TimMc56,3,Mon Jun 22 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"Pacific coach is easy, but very time consuming because of the ferry. I personally use harbour air. Lands you right in the inner harbour and pretty reasonably priced when compared to the alternative. Don't rely on public transit thought. Getting there on the Vancouver side is easy enough, but Victoria transit is terrible."

VictoriaBC,3aoiwt,vicgeo,2,Mon Jun 22 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"It's probably too late now, but adding the yvr to yyj flight to a larger itinerary doesn't usually cost a lot extra.  That saves you the time consuming (but beautiful) ferry ride.  Then you take a shuttle into downtown.  Buying the flight separately is usually more painfully expensive."

VictoriaBC,3aoiwt,TimMc56,2,Mon Jun 22 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"I have travelled with a large suitcase, as have many people on the island (one girl had 3 suitcases herself!) and this was during Christmas/New Years so probably it wouldn't be that bad as there will be less people with luggage.

If you go up to Nanaimo, Calder Road off Jingle Pot near exit 18 of the Nanaimo Bypass is the only hill I've had to give up and walk up because the bike's front tire kept lifting off the road - the sign at the top reads either 26 or 28 percent grade according to street view."

I'm a bike packing rider and enjoy longer rides and have to say this book is amazing.  Massive cuesheet lists with maps and ride descriptions.  Also try looking into the Rotary ride on the island here.  Depending on your pace it's a good couple days if you want.    For more gravel and logging road the options get even better.  Look up vikapproved and the missing link ride as well as his mapping of a transcanada esq ride from tip to tip of the island.

It's close-knit as well and I consider some of the regulars like a second family. Everybody is really friendly and welcoming!    Although it will be less empty on weekdays they are open 7 days a week and have wicked drink specials.  They do a decent amount of drag events year round and are about to kick it into high gear for the Victoria pride parade!   Monday nights are karaoke and an absolute  blast if that's your type of thing. Great selection and you're able to get a lot of songs in. I started out just going to karaoke every week and never looked back!   Hope you have a great time!

I just moved into Victoria because of this. I know they wanna build a tech park and stuff but look, do you really think Langford will be able to attract High tech companies to there overpriced tech park when in Victoria you can get office space for dirt cheap.

VictoriaBC,3ajqej,th3fiddy,-3,Sun Jun 21 05:49:14 2015 UTC,No that's Bradys fish and chips.. Won't eat there again. They use very very thin halibut or cod and triple batter it over and over to give it the appearance it is a nice big piece like you would get at Haultains. Bradys also had horrible customer service ie two or 3 staff working nearly empty maybe 1 or 2 walk ins and took over 20min uber slow. Haultains great service not ignored and orders delt with promptly and with out to long to wait. They (Bradys) were also telling a employee once not to use whatever it was to clean a mess but use paper towels cause of the cost etc in front of customers awhile back.. Really ..They (Bradys) were also over cooked to beyond chewy and fish the size of a female with small hands.. Ive had the same quality for years at Haultains with nice size portions . Bradys it was always hit and miss. Haultains only batters it once or twice and doesn't try and hide the fact they use large thick portions of fish. James Bay fish and chips is also good but not nearly as enjoyable as Haultains.

VictoriaBC,3aikdv,AcidicAndHostile,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you. My guide book (by, Tim Leaden) strongly recommends this one. It looks like the whole trail is 47km/29mi and would take 4-5 days to hike. We will only have 3 days and will probably have to do a out-and-back in order to get back to our vehicle. Is there a particular section that you like best?"
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,SuperisSteven,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"I did it in two days, so depending on your fitness you could potentially do it that quickly too. If you're not interested the southern half is definitely the better bit. Camping right on the beach. Also hitchhiking back or grabbing a ride on the trail bus are both good options to save an out and back."
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,toseeg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Was it a real ball buster to manage it in two days? We're in good shape (train for powerlifting and also run/hike throughout the year) but as I mentioned, I've never hiked on a beach so I'm having trouble judging time/distances. I didn't know about the trail bus and had considered hitch hiking, but my wife is hesitant to hitch hike. I've done it a number of times to get back to trail heads and have always met cool people doing it. The trail bus is a game changer.   I found this: http://www.trailbus.com/Schedule_jdft.html  Do you find it necessary to make reservations in advance? Is there cell service out there?"
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,SuperisSteven,3,Sun Jun 21 05:35:16 2015 UTC,"The record for JDF in its entirety is about 5.5 hrs, wink wink  There will be no cell service for most/all of the trail. I'd recommend to do it starting from China beach going towards Port Renfrew as you would be done with the difficult bit earlier. Overall, it's a fantastic trail and I cast my vote in with others for it."
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,AcidicAndHostile,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm going to plan to do this exact hike, unless we're burned out from hiking after Olympic National Park and decide we just need to take it easy, in which case we'll go to the North Coast and just hang out and do day hikes.   Question: Am I correct in reading the bus schedule as only doing one trip per day, so we'll need to catch that 5:45 bus back south from Port Renfrew in order to return to our vehicle at the Chin Beach trailhead?"
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,hippopatimus,2,Sun Jun 21 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"I was in ok, but not amazing, shape and it was a bit of a challenge but completely doable.

I think the other replies here will probably be of more help to you.

VictoriaBC,3aikdv,iknowwhereiam,2,Sun Jun 21 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"I have not, but I do know that it is very well organized. Do you have any specific questions about the trail bus?  Anyway, the trail starts at China Beach / Mystic Beach. It ends at Botanical Beach in Port Renfrew. Port Renfrew is also the start of the West Coast Trail.  Once you have finished the Juan de Fuca Trail at Botanical, you'll need to walk about 2 km down the road to the hotel and backpacker hostel. That's the bus stop for the bus going back into Victoria.  I've given rides to backpackers from Botanical into Victoria, so you may get lucky.  We go camping at China Beach once or twice a summer (we'll be there in a couple of weeks) at the drive-in campground. That section of the coast is really great.  Let me know what your plans are and I'll be happy to provide info if you like."
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,UyhAEqbnp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. We'll have a rental SUV that we'll park at whichever trailhead we begin at. Based on some of the other suggestions here and my guide book, I think we'll park at Chin beach and hike to Port Renfrew over two or three days. We'll have already done a pretty major hike in Olympic National Park before coming here, and in an effort to not find myself divorced at the end of our journey, we might want to take it easier on this hike. So I'm thinking 10km/day hiking so we can rest/enjoy the beach etc along the way.  Looking at the bus schedule, it seems like it just makes one trip a day--so I'll need to be at the Port Renfrew bus stop at 5:45pm on the day I want to ride back to our vehicle at the Chin beach trail head. Is that accurate?"
VictoriaBC,3aikdv,teamleda,2,Mon Jun 22 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the bus departure time from Port Renfrew, but if it leaves at 5:45PM you may want to plan to arrive at Botanical Beach parking lot by 3PM or so, to give you time to walk down to the bus stop (assuming the busstop is at the hotel). Botanical Beach itself is pretty fantastic and is a daytrip in its own right, with 3 separate and distinctive beaches included in the park. We go there every year, although we usually rent a cabin in Port Renfrew. This year we'll be there over Labour Day.  As for your SUV although it's probably fine be aware that vandals do break into cars along that section of West Coast Road, including sometimes in the trailhead parking lot at Mystic Beach. So make sure you take anything valuable with you. There is a volunteer group that watches over the parking lot, and most hikers park at the trailhead anyway, but it's still something to be aware of."

The 'science' based stuff has, so far, failed me with, at best, short term results lasting only a day or two before things return, and at the other end, causing me more irritation.    Taking a position to an extreme (e.g., mocking anything that has an 'organic' label, which I agree doesn't tell us much at all or have too much meaning)  fails regardless of which extreme you take (e.g., following the 'science' approach dogmatically).

I'm going to babble a bit here, so feel free to ignore and no need to reply. I'm just trying to find this skin cream to try and see if it works for me.  I'm glad you can rule out so many things as Western Science has done without error or mistake for so long; thank goodness that they had 'deep breathing' for health/relaxation, meditation, what to do about H.pylori, leaches (now cupping, vacuum pressure in local areas to speed healing), use of psychedelics to treat addictions and mental issues, putting the feces of a healthy person up the arse of one who's digestive systems are fubar, all the animals dying around Cherynobyl, use of marijuana for a billion things, research into electric cars, that over 30 years we've gone from thinking the Universe will start contracting back to a single point and repeat the big-bang process to learning it's still accelerating in it's expansion, etc etc etc. Hell, even the sci-fi writers positing the most mocked of ideas have been finding themselves vindicated by scientists decades later actually testing their idea instead of writing it off. Sunscreen/sunglasses to wear or not? Red wine? Eggs? Turns out both sides have been right about aspects of many of these last few, but also wrong in the mechanisms and contects their assumptions are true...kinda...  it's the wave/particle models of light sorta situation - both aren't right, both aren't wrong, but parts of both apply in different contexts and combined have allowed more accurate predictions of the behaviors of light in both 'regular' and extreme situations; both groups had to take their heads out of their asses, stop defending their 'turf' and go back to being scientists who are looking for the best theories/predictive measures not for THEIRS to be the best.     Some stuff doesn't work.   Some stuff works in mechanisms or for reasons that are just convoluted, not clear, confusing, or obfuscated by other variables.    Some works with a portion of the people but not another (genetic, other interactions?).    Anyway, I'm in babble mode...but the point is, a real doesn't fight to defend their theory, the excitedly look for new ways to test it, or contradictory theories that can better predict or explain the world.     For the last few decades, big pharma, as one example, has been scouring the world for any ancient texts/codexes - the older the better - all for hints as to which uses flaura/fauna have been put to use in traditional medicine aroudn the world - because they are finding clues for research everywhere.    If I hear that a culture has 1000s of years of history using a natural product to do X - I may just give that a shot.   Sure this product isn't 1000 years old, but I'm willing to spend $20 to TEST it on myself based on the anecdotal evidence of a few individuals - especially when they found some success where other products suggested by Western Medicine have failed to help after $100's of dollars. If it works, yey - regardless of mechanism (mental or chemical), and if it doesn't - regardless of mechanism - I will have tested this product in a very simple experiment on one subject - me. Seems a lot more scientific to me than ruling out something because, on principal, anything 'organic' is bad/hookum/fake/no working etc.      Organic as a label is broad and meaningless - just like GMO - it's the inidivdual product and how it's used that should help make a decision and just as if I found this one product worked I wouldn't thereafter swear to only use organic everything, I don't make all seed choices for my garden based on GMO status, 'heirloom' status, etc - I do it after testing a product, usually based on recommendations and research, and then make a decision.  I've no idea if this will actually work for me - but I'm willing to experiment and try.    The results, though, won't apply to any other products put out by 'Organic Doctor', labeled organic, etc - whether this product works for me or not."

Pointing to past mistakes (or still-unclear hypotheses) only shows the development we've achieved, not failures we should be ashamed of. Progress often comes hand in hand with failure.   If I hear that a culture has 1000s of years of history using a natural product to do X  a very simple experiment on one subject - me. Seems a lot more scientific to me than ruling out something because, on principal, anything 'organic' is bad/hookum/fake/no working etc.    As I said before, feel free to use products that work for you. I choose to avoid organic because it encourages the use of pesticides which are dangerous to human health and the environment, while providing no extra nutrition. I chose that belief because the majority of evidence seems to point that way, but I am happy to review any additional evidence you wish to present.  But when it comes to regulations and medical advice, we need to look at scientific studies - not personal or historical anecdotes. As you said, pharmaceutical companies are constantly looking for new compounds (although most new drugs are developed using modern methods in combinatorial or rational-design organic or biochemical synthesis, not by scouring the world for ancient texts)."

If it was made of something neat, like local sand washed driftwood or something more eco-friendly/less sharp looking, and it wasn't using a parking space, most people would ask for more of these to be built vs. complain. Honestly.   I personally think that the downtown area should be riddled with benches/seating options that are maintained/kept clean. Parents, elderly, and people with disabilities all rely on amenities like benches/bathrooms/parking when planning out a day's activities.

I don't think the concept is a bad one, but I'm pretty sure the execution is going leave a lot to be desired. The city's been getting worse at infrastructure maintenance over the years too, not better.    I mean, they haven't even finished repainting all the light poles in the city from years ago, even in the most tourist-heavy parts of the city!

VictoriaBC,3acm93,FredThe12th,2,Fri Jun 19 06:21:50 2015 UTC,Wow that is a blast from the past.  I remember making the trek there from McMaster Uni for the cheap beer.  Not the best beer but drinkable when cold and it sure is/was cheap.

VictoriaBC,3acm93,samuraipizzacat71,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'll be sure to ask for it, though I'm sure it'll be prohibitively expensive.  I checked the lcbo site(there are no local liquor stores in Ontario. Only a crown corp that sells liquor and beer and a foreign corporation given a legal monopoly on larger cases of beer. Nobody else can sell alcohol) and what is available from around here is pretty damn expensive. A bottle of Electric Unicorn by Phillips is $6.25, and a tallboy of Blue Buck is $2.75.   I've been here for over a month now and I got to try almost every single local beer, and I have to say what's available here is some of the best I've ever tried. At least La Fin Du Monde is available in Ontario, which is my favourite beer anyway. But even then it isn't available in the 750ml bottles that I prefer! Ontario just sucks for beer lovers as every store has the exact same thing and there's no mystery in going to a new store and seeing what's there."
VictoriaBC,3acm93,samuraipizzacat71,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:11:00 2015 UTC,Damn that sucks. The BCL stores don't carry that much craft beer compared to the private ones but they're more expensive in general  I like going to the breweries and filing up my growlers.

But in 2010 they broke up AJ and Crash in the morning.    They had a good system.  They'd do the show but Pat would do the news. Also they had tons of prizes for Jackaholic points.  I got a lot of neat stuff with them.  Now it's next to nothing.  Then it was just a slow decline.  Dene and her stupid Gutair, no longer playing what they want.  Tarzan Dan (didn't mind him so much)   but now as Kiss it's just  that awful ""Take me to church"" song  and a few others on repeat."

When you drive to work with a song playing then drive home with the same song it's a bit annoying.  I've actually swapped stations and all of them were playing the same song all at the same time.
VictoriaBC,3aahn1,na85,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:46:07 2015 UTC,"Kiss FM and Jack FM and most other radio stations are all owned by one or two big conglomerates.  In this case both Kiss and Jack are Rogers, and Kool FM is Bell.  You can usually tell if the radio station is a corporate piece of shit because they tend to leave out the ""point"".  They say shit like ""One Oh Three One.... Jack FM"" or whatever, because some corporate sleaze decided leaving out the decimal was cool.  I remember when this happened, pretty much across the country:  I was in high school at the time and this awesome radio station got bought out by Corus (which is Shaw) and they changed from saying ""one oh three point one"" to ""one oh three one"".  That's been my identification scheme for radio cesspools ever since, and it's never let me down."

VictoriaBC,3abrft,You_Dont_Nomi,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Canadian food is pretty similar to the States, but another person mentioned poutine which is pretty iconic. I personally really like the poutine at Garrick's Head Bar- and I like the bar too- if you sit in the way back away from the street it's not as noisy.  Nanaimo bars are from close to here and incredibly good but rich. You can get them at coffee shops or bakeries. I think Murchies on Gov does an okay one- but if anyone has some standout recommendations they should let us know. Ketchup flavoured potato chips are pretty Canadian and amazing tasting.Smarties chocolate candies too- I’ve heard you can’t get in the states. Yum. Kind of a sweet M&M?    The seafood on the island is pretty outstanding, and I would recommend trying Ferris's Oyster bar and Grill (they have other great stuff- Not Just Oysters!), Red Fish, Blue Fish, and the Tapa Bar or Bodega in Trounce Alley. Breakfast is BIG in Victoria, everyone has their favourites but I like Jam, Shine, Mole and Avalon. Everywhere will have a lineup on the weekend if you don’t get down there before nine.   Downtown has a ton of bars, and honestly it's all about what you enjoy. There are louder, larger places like those in the Strathcona Hotel, generic solid pubs like Smiths, Lounge-y cocktail centric places like Little Jumbo, Veneto or The Mint. I like Bart’s(Bartholomew’s)  or Garrick’s because it's a range of ages and varied crowd. Tourists seem to love Irish Times and The Bard and Banker (same family runs both) but while I agree they're beautiful buildings and lovely places- they're a bit pricey for my budget.    As cheesy as it is, I love Craigdarroch Castle. A coal baron on the island, Robert Dunsmuir had it built and the stories about him are just crazy. It’s also close to government house which is the property of our lieutenant Governor and is honestly just a great vantage point to walk around. You’re allowed to wander as it’s crown land. Anywhere along Dallas road is beautiful and Macaulay point park in Esquimalt has all of these great views and fun old cement bunker/gunning stations/lookouts from when things weren’t quite so rosy with the Americans.   Prices and animal rights aside, avoid the carriage tours and the pedi cabs.  I’m constantly walking past or behind these tours and hearing all of the bullshit that they make up. Some things I’ve heard are just plain wrong, over embellished or accurate perhaps to somewhere else- further that they won’t reach with their tour- so they lie and say it was on the route they’re taking. The pedi cabs aren’t quite as bad, but they are definitely trying to fleece the tourists.   There are some great furniture spots, but if you’re looking for clothing I’m not too sure.   No really bad parts in Victoria, though there are in Vancouver. Be more careful there."
VictoriaBC,3abrft,spammyjoe,2,Sat Jun 20 00:01:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for all of the information!  I have Craigdarroch castle on my list so I'm glad it got a recommendation. :)  And I can not WAIT to check out that seafood.......it's not the same here in good ol' potato land!
VictoriaBC,3abrft,sideways8,2,Sat Jun 20 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"Victoria has festivals and events basically nonstop all summer long. If you're into cars, there will likely be a car show, if you're into music, there will likely be a music festival. This weekend, for example, is FernFest, which is a huge block party in Fernwood that involves a children's bicycle parade, local artisans on display, and a beer garden with tons of great local bands, for three evenings in a row. On Sunday there will be a huge Japanese car show in one of the far out neighborhoods, and they'll be closing the main drag downtown to car traffic for a street party.  Don't know which weekend you will be here, but check Monday Magazine, Snap Magazine and the local radio stations, which all have lots of event listings. Here too: http://downtownvictoria.ca/events.  Supermoto racing is on at Western Speedway on Tuesday nights (4-7pm), bike polo is at Fernwood Community Center on Wednesday nights (8-11pm), and Durrance Lake is great for getting wet.  Flavour Upstairs on Johnson St is good for thrift shopping."

VictoriaBC,3abrft,kodawari,2,Sat Jun 20 18:27:51 2015 UTC,I believe nobody mentioned the ferries. A tour of the harbour and Gorge with http://www.victoriaharbourferry.com is always nice.

VictoriaBC,3abrft,evade16,2,Wed Jun 24 02:58:50 2015 UTC,Yep! You watch it from the dock in front of The Empress on Government St. It lasts some 15' to classical music and it's meant to show the amazing maneuverability of the little ferries and the talent of their captains.  It's cool to have some good breakfast downtown in one of the traditional places and then go watch the guys do their thing.

VictoriaBC,3abrft,ignore_my_typo,5,Sun Jun 21 04:57:42 2015 UTC,"Canadian Snacks: Poutine (La Belle Patate or Flying Otter in my opinion), Fresh Seafood Finest At Sea Seafood has some amazing fresh and prepared seafood, I recommend their cold smoked tuna, smoked salmon or smoked oysters before going down to fisherman's wharf for Barbs fish and chips.  Best restaurants, For casual I like Flying Otter because it is relativly cheap and provides great atmosphere, for some higher class Brasserie L'école is also nice. I went there for my anniversary and then went to the Bengal Lounge for drinks afterwards which is nice to do.  Cool bars, Big Bad John, Yates Street, Canoe, Smiths, Roof Top to name a few.  Cool Things to do, Maritime Museum is pretty cool to see plus the Royal BC Museum is having a Gold Rush exhibit on when you are in town. Check out the Empress Hotel for some fancy old style experience but just walking around downtown you will see a bunch of cool old things like there are purple tiles in the sidewalk which are ""skylights"" for tunnels that used to be used by shop owners in the 1800s or waddington ally still has original wooden cobble stones. I recommend you find a walking tour of the city or a haunted ghost tour and you will learn a lot of cool pieces of history.   Things you need to do and forget the costs or crowds. Whale Watching is top of the list. I have lived on the Island since I was a kid and never went whale watching until a few weeks ago and it was by far one of the best experiences. Buchart Gardens is also really cool to check out as it is a national heritage site and really is amazing. Those are the two big touristy traps we had but there are others.  I don't do a lot of thrift shopping but Victoria has a ton of vintage shops you should check out. Vintage Funk has everything from cloths to memorabilia and accessories and trinkets, The Patch is another great vintage store but walk around downtown on Johnson Street and the surrounding streets and you will find something you will like.   In terms of neighborhoods to avoid there aren't any in Victoria that are super ghetto or sketchy like you have in Vancouver. Personally I would avoid esquimalt because it has a rep of being bad but even then it is fine overall. For things to do though stick to finding an Air BnB somewhere in the downtown core, james bay, fernwood, cook street village area.  Let me know if I missed anything.   Also my body is ready for other victorians to say my suggestions are crap and her are better bar :P"

If you do come to Sooke, which is about 45 minutes driving from Victoria you should make a point of spending an afternoon outdoors here. Ziplining at Adrenaline Is really fun. But if you want a fantastic hike I would suggest heading to East Sooke Park. I personally would head for Iron Mine Bay location. It's about 1km easy walk in but its through the rainforest.

VictoriaBC,3a6vry,MrYYJ,14,Wed Jun 17 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"Here are the details:  This year we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the School-Based weather station network. Since the first station was installed on Strawberry Vale Elementary in March, 2005 the network has expanded to 165 different locations, including schools in all school districts on Vancouver and the Gulf Islands.  Averaging 600 000 visits per month, the weather station network and its maintenance have been funded exclusively from external funds I received from a number of granting councils, together with a lot of volunteer hours. Unfortunately, since getting elected as the BC Green MLA for Oak Bay Gordon Head, I no longer have access to these external funds. As a consequence, the Weather Station network will be unsupported effective June 30, 2016 and will have to shut down then.  In an attempt to secure a more sustainable long-term solution I approached UVic senior administration for support. But none was forthcoming.  If this service is valuable to you, please consider writing to UVic's senior administration: vpr@uvic.ca, provost@uvic.ca, president@uvic.ca, with a copy to weather@uvic.ca.  In doing so, please consider sharing any stories you might have with respect to how you have used the weather station data.  Thank-you for your support over the years.  Andrew Weaver"

VictoriaBC,3a7acx,addi00,7,Wed Jun 17 20:01:07 2015 UTC,Aren't they a shaw reseller?
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,james121345,7,Wed Jun 17 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"I believe Reseller is inaccurate - Shaw owns the ""last mile"" lines to residential (and commericial?) properties. There is no other way to get cable internet unless you go through Shaw's last mile infrastructure.  I believe Juce owns and operates their own network infrastructure, they just hitch a ride on the tail end via Shaw to get to your house.  It's the rates that Shaw charges for that last mile ""tail end"" that are oppressive to competition. You can look up TPIA (Third Party ISP Access) for related 'reseller' regulation and commentary. If you're the petitioning type, check out https://unblockcanada.ca/ for some more actionable information.  I don't know the history, but presumably Shaw paid with their own coin to lay the lines down, so they own them outright. If so, then in a free market, they should be able to charge whatever they like (which is obviously what they'd like to be doing) - but CRTC is supposed to a) regulate prices and b) ensure market competition. I'm not sure how well CRTC is doing on either of those points - the incumbents seem to be doing a good job of finding loopholes, from the little I've read.  From the Juce FAQ:   How does JUCE internet work? We run our own network connecting to internet core, and we use high capacity fiber links to connect to areas where our services are available. We rely on incumbent's cable network for ""last-mile"" connectivity to end-users' homes. This is why you will see a technician from incumbent carrier come to your home to do installations etc.   I think my understanding of the situation is fairly accurate... but feel free to correct me!"

VictoriaBC,3a7acx,FredThe12th,2,Thu Jun 18 17:38:48 2015 UTC,From my understanding there's no data transfer being done by any of Shaw's servers on the 'last mile' so that makes sense.

VictoriaBC,3a7acx,ionsquare,0,Thu Jun 18 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"That's the complete opposite of what my understand was. I follow what goes on in the states all the time so, I'm used to the big guy owns the infra- and the smaller deals the last mile.   If juce is using Shaw's last mile, that is incredibly un-smart of them. The last mile isn't the expensive part of the infrastructure, from my understanding."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,Decapentaplegia,3,Wed Jun 17 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see how else they would be a new business and get internet into people's homes. It's probably the easiest, quickest and cheapest (I'd think) way.  I'm sure they could lay their own lines if they were incredibly well funded - but I don't think I'd trivialize the expense (money, time, manpower) of doing so.  But then, by your understanding, leasing the last mile from Shaw should be really cheap... but it's so very not, looking at Shaw's TPIA rate sheet."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,wrainedaxx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"The last mile might be the cheapest infrastructure, but there's an incredible amount of area to cover. Think of the cost of laying lines to thousands of homes on thousands of streets."

VictoriaBC,3a7acx,james121345,11,Wed Jun 17 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"I've had my Shaw 25Mbps plan for a quite a few years, and the rates still seem to go up all the time. Grandfathering is a loose term around Shaw, I think."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,james121345,3,Wed Jun 17 22:16:54 2015 UTC,This. I've been using Shaw since 2005 and they have consistently raised my rates. No loyalty among thieves.
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,james121345,3,Wed Jun 24 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"For people such as myself who just signed up with shaw recently, and don't have any grandfathered rate, it's beneficial to switch. All I need is for Juce to last a couple months and I'll be saving 30% a month."

VictoriaBC,3a7acx,jeffdsfc,6,Wed Jun 17 21:05:05 2015 UTC,It's not profitable or sustainable to undercut shaw since it's not like shaw is offering them a massive deal for running the last mile.

In Canada particularly, since we seem to like our monopolies, duopolies, etc so much, it would likely need to be some government body interested in introducing market competition - they'd need to co-invest with New Big Company to do so, offsetting some of the initiative's risk."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,ionsquare,5,Thu Jun 18 03:49:01 2015 UTC,My grandfathered rates at Shaw kept going up regardless.  Even if Juce are only around for just a few months/years that's a bit of respite considering I'm now paying $44/month instead of $75/month for the same speed but no data caps.
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,samuraipizzacat71,3,Wed Jun 17 22:04:17 2015 UTC,This has been my experience as well. I'd advise anyone with Shaw to take anything relating to 'grandfathering with Shaw' out of your decision making if looking to move to another provider. It's a load of BS.
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,RyanKeslerSucks,3,Wed Jun 17 22:27:59 2015 UTC,"Juce becomes popular, so Shaw jacks up the price for using their architecture     Shaw is currently petitioning the CRTC to see wholesale rates raised.    From Juce.ca:     *The incumbent cable carrier filed to CRTC to withdraw Cable 25 (25Mbps) plan to new customers on July 3rd, 2015. If approved, we will not be able to sell Cable 25 to new customers after July 3rd, 2015. Customers who subscribes to Cable 25 before July 3rd 2015 will be grandfathered and will keep $39.95/month price going forward and they will not be affected in anyway. In separate CRTC application, the incumbent cable carrier is seeking to set our cost for the new 30Mbps plan at 127% higher than existing 25Mbps plan. Therefore the new 30Mbps maybe priced much higher if this application is approved by CRTC. We recommend that customers wishing to purchase Cable 25 do so before July 3rd, 2015 to qualify for grandfathered status and pricing."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,TechnicallyITsCoffee,2,Wed Jun 17 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating how they talk about grandfathering rates as if it is a courtesy or a privilege for longtime customers, when really it is just a chokehold. If you change your address you lose the rates."
VictoriaBC,3a7acx,ElMorono,4,Wed Jun 17 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's not like Juce wants to raise the rates on July 3rd.  Shaw is forcing their hand - if anything, you could see this as a play by Shaw to make small players look bad. It essentially is a chokehold move on Shaw's part to the TPIA 'resellers' like Juce.  Juce 'grandfathering' the 25Mbps plan customers is just a way to respect people who signed up before that date. And while I don't know this for sure, I think it's Shaw who would force the removal of any grandfathered rate upon moving - I see no mention of that on Juce's website."

So much better than the $75 I was paying with Shaw.  Got the $50 modem to minimize congestion during peak times because we do a lot of downloading.  Closed out my Shaw account on Sunday. Went into the Uptown location and a lady was in there with her son trying to close one account and open another, I'm assuming to get introductory rates. She absolutely went berserk on the CSR there.

Of the almost 30 channels that come with their basic cable package, 5 are simply advertising channels for their other subscription packages, which you of course have to pay for. (Channel 5: Crave TV, only for a low price amount! Channel 10: See what's on Telus Optic TV! Channel 15: Crave Deals of the week channel! And so on.)  The internet seems pretty damn slow as well. I moved last month, and went with Shaw again, (I had them at an old apartment) and I found the deal they offered me was great, and the cable package is quite good too.

There's some big ass trees I'm supposed to check out. Driving up and west to tofino I'm told is an experience.  Thank you for your reply, Mr unhelpful."
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,stevo911_,5,Wed Jun 17 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"Mr. Unhelpfuls most helpful post! (kind of) If you've never been on the coast Tofino is totally worthwhile, or if you don't want to do as much of a drive (it's going to be close to 5 hours each way), Botanical Beach,  and China Beach or Sombrio, are all beautiful (You could do the pacific marine circle route, there's a big ass tree on that).  Though cathedral grove is pretty spectacular too. No experience with that rental company, so I'm just as unhelpful :)"
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,KittyMonster,3,Wed Jun 17 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Mile 0 of the Trans Canada highway (""the edge of the country"") is just south of downtown. You don't need a car to get there, but of course it makes things easier.   I realize you're not asking for advice on this, but a really great drive if you want to go then whole day is out through Sooke,  up to Port Renfrew, in through the Pacific Marine Rd to Lake Cowichan and then down through Duncan back to Vic. Detour through Cobble Hill or out to Cowichan Bay if you want a taste of our farm land."
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,KittyMonster,0,Wed Jun 17 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"Mile 0 sounds like it would definitely be worth visiting and getting a photo. I may not have made the post with wanting to hear about places to see/visit. But the gesture and ideas are welcomed. Once I leave the city on the second, I'm basically winging it.  Thank you."
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,ninjatune,3,Thu Jun 18 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly in only two days I wouldn't go up to Tofino.  It is absolutely gorgeous but it's a 4.5 hour drive each way, so you basically lose a day in transit.   Going up and around Port Ren allows you to see a very similar environment as well as allows time to really explore treasures like Sombrio,  Botanical Beach and Pacheedaht Bay.   You can camp overnight in Sombrio or Pacheedaht or Lake Cowichan or wherever along the way"
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,SuperisSteven,2,Thu Jun 18 02:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah? Hmm. Folks I work with keep saying the drive there is worth. It's not like the 5 hours from Edmonton to the Rockies. But I gather I should listen more so to a local. My one argument with the folks I work with is tofino is a big tourist attraction. Nice, but lots of people especially around Canada day I'd imagine. I'll take your input and look over a map tonight after my shift."
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,TylerrelyT,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:55:45 2015 UTC,There and back driving wise in a day you're looking at 8 hours.
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,KittyMonster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"Which isn't really that bad. Up at 6am, you're there by 10:30am driving with light the whole time. Lounge on the beach for a few hours, go for a hike, have a couple meals and you can still be back in Victoria just as the sun goes down. Maybe I'm a sadist because I do similar drives, and 14 hour driving days sometimes, but I'd say it's worth the adventure. It's a nice drive through Coombs, Ladysmith and all that."
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,TylerrelyT,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:14:56 2015 UTC,Do it.   The drive to Tofino is nicer than the drive to port Renfrew and to be fair the loop around cowichan is nearly the length of the drive to Tofino.
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,KittyMonster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:59:59 2015 UTC,Yes so the total travel time is half that to Tofino and back.
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,Vic2013,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:27:07 2015 UTC,For a drive that is far superior.
VictoriaBC,3a7ski,Vic2013,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:52:00 2015 UTC,It is a huge tourist attraction and summer is peak season. There is no free camping (or if there is it's booked up waaaay in advance) so you have to budget a stay in a hotel/motel   I understand the love for Tofino but personally I would rather have quality time exploring a closer area vs losing a day in transit to get somewhere 30% more aesthetically pleasing hahaha. They're all on the same coast after all so it's very similar scenery.   The drive up to Tofino is honestly pretty boring (you're on a major highway) until you hit Port Alberni and then it gets really nice (cathedral grove etc)

VictoriaBC,3a4a1i,matth3wm,2,Wed Jun 17 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"So, I Google searched ""Prior Lake Victoria"" after reading this. I wanted to know where Prior Lake was, I don't think I've ever been there.  This is the first thing I saw: http://www.mondaymag.com/news/153248225.html  For those who don't want to click, here's some copy/paste:  ""Naturists shed societal layers at Prior Lake  I stand at the edge of the long, narrow dock jutting into the pristine lake cocooned in a forest, and a feeling of awkwardness washes over me. Maybe it’s the years of social conditioning, or the unfamiliar feeling of being exposed in a public setting that has me on edge — after all, some of my worst dreams are those when I suddenly realize I am naked in a public place.  And now I am.  It’s a typical day at Prior Lake, the only location in Greater Victoria that is officially clothing-optional. The dock, and the tiny 10-foot-wide adjacent beach, is jam-packed with sunbathers. My discomfort isn’t due to the skin around me, though, but rather the impending removal of the last remnants of my own clothing: a bikini top and bottom. I hadn’t anticipated this.  The crowd seems perfectly at ease in varying shapes and sizes: from saggy, plump and aged, to thin and toned. My own friends, who are regulars of the lake, liberate themselves of their clothing within seconds of claiming their spot on the dock. What am I missing that seems so appealing to this oddly diverse mix of nude people?""  There's more... but TL;DR = Prior Lake has a nude beach."

Sometimes a bit of a shocker upon initial dive in, but the body acclimatizes quite quickly. Matheson is also lovely and secluded, but it can be a tad chilly due to tree coverage. I know contact to sunlight doesn't affect the water temp too much beyond the first few inches, but often times it's just nice to have some sun on your back."
VictoriaBC,3a4a1i,danamal,3,Wed Jun 17 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"I went out to Thetis with my family the other day when it was super hot, and we found the bigger beach access area to be very pleasant. My kids were all the way in within moments, and they're pretty wary of the cold."

The next day I had some guy pounding on my door saying he found my trash in his company dumpster bin and threatened to call the police if I didn't get it out of there ASAP. One of the boxes had my address on it. ""Mr. Steve"" did a midnight drop in this guys bin and pocketed all of his fee.

VictoriaBC,3a0fq5,ziggg76,5,Tue Jun 16 07:07:39 2015 UTC,Juan DE fuca has a pitch and putt

VictoriaBC,3a0fq5,danma,3,Wed Jun 17 16:26:06 2015 UTC,I worked for Prospect Lake Golf COurse for a few summers. Favourite quick course to play in the city. Its a par 4 with the longest hole being around 350-400 yards but nothing too hard. I highly recomend going as it is closing for good at the end of this season

VictoriaBC,3a0fq5,MileZeroC,2,Tue Jun 16 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Longest hole at Henderson is 100 yards.  They have really cheap rates after 6pm (think $6).  Normal is $12 I believe.  Play takes about 1 hour in a group of 4.  Free round on fathers day, although it might be busy. https://www.oakbay.ca/parks-recreation/facilities-rentals/recreation-centres/henderson-recreation-centre/golf-course  Mount doug is a 9 hole, longest is 220 I think.  Also quite affordable but you will need a few more clubs. http://www.mtdouggolfvictoria.ca/course-info/"

His first time at a Golf course, he had a blast and can't wait to do it again.  I was originally thinking Green Acres in Metchosin as it's nice and short but, we never made it out that far.  Royal Oak was more expensive than Prospect lake. Henderson is nice, I've played there before as well."

They are selling or have already sold but have a stipulation that the land be a community gathering point like the golf course is so either maintain the course open or redevelop it with some form of community centered area.

VictoriaBC,39xpdo,ThomsonSyndrome,3,Mon Jun 15 19:16:28 2015 UTC,"How far in the process are you?  My advice, get a lawyer, have him postpone the dispute court date until after your class 5 date. Then just pay the ticket.   The lawyer's retainer will be cheaper than losing your license, getting it back, and all the fees and fines associated with it.   And that's assuming that you don't get a ticket after, because once you get your license back you're right back on probation for the 2 years your N is reset for, so only one other ticket will cost you your license a second time."

If so sell it and get something plain looking.

VictoriaBC,39xpdo,DoubleExposure,2,Tue Jun 16 18:10:53 2015 UTC,Guessing the exhaust is louder? Odds are you just sound like you're going a lot faster than you actually are. Combine that with a late shift and it sounds like you're really ripping.   $10 says if you accelerated the same in a stock Corolla nobody would even look at you.
VictoriaBC,39xpdo,stevo911_,2,Tue Jun 16 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"All the aftermarket exhaust does is call attention to you like a big neon arrow pointing to you saying ""Look at me, I'm a teenager/new driver and am probably going to do something stupid"".  I used to drive a modified civic, that wasn't very obviously modified and only a little louder than stock (had a higher flow exhaust to let the motor swap breathe, but was still full cat/resonator/muffler) when I used to race AutoX at western speedway.  I would get tailed frequently when I drove past a cop, and was stopped at most roadblocks,etc...  I switched to a forester (I put a ton of miles on logging roads every year) and have been waived through every road block without them batting an eyelash, and haven't noticed being tailed by a cop since.   I always drove the civic responsibly on the streets (no tickets in the 12 years I've had my licence), but it made it really easy for them to profile me.  The thing about stereotypes/profiling, is most of the time it's a pretty efficient way of narrowing down the search for offenders."

Make no mistake, Victoria has the worst bloody drivers in Canada. And it's all over the map; too slow, clueless, terrified, discourteous, aggressive, too passive, confused, distracted, inexperienced, ignorant, and a general lack of 'rules of the road' understanding.

Is there a set limit for how long you can be in the left lane or how far you are from your left turn before you can be in the lane?

VictoriaBC,39px1p,onemorepost,39,Sat Jun 13 16:38:12 2015 UTC,I think part of the problem is police can't be everywhere or stop everyone.   I see drivers breaking rules every single day. It is no different with cyclists.
VictoriaBC,39px1p,micredable,-8,Sat Jun 13 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"this.. If VicPD is too understaffed to investigate child rape cases, they are probably too understaffed to enforce other laws as well."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,Numerolophile,28,Sat Jun 13 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"Probably for the same reason you don't see a lot of jaywalking tickets handed out.  A cyclist/pedestrian/skateboarder/etc who is breaking the rules of the road is likely to end up injuring only themselves, like in the example you cited.    Enforcement is stricter on motor vehicles because not following the rules is far more likely to injure or kill other people and/or cause large amounts of property damage.   And even for motor vehicles there are varying degrees of enforcement;  operating a semi-truck for example requires a higher standard of licensing and inspection than a sedan."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,Frosc,2,Sat Jun 13 17:12:46 2015 UTC,Jaywalking isn't strictly prohibited though and and has a lot of lenient conditions. See 179 and 180 of the MVA and section 10 of the Streets and Traffic Bylaws.
VictoriaBC,39px1p,Stormkiko,14,Sun Jun 14 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Tickets just deter riding in general. I think it's about creating a culture of accountability by cyclists that they have to obey the laws, but that the laws are looking out for them.   I am moving soon to Victoria from Amsterdam in the Netherlands where there are more bikes than people. It is surprisingly safe biking around the city here. You only see helmets on small children riding with their parents or on the occasional long distance cyclist. It works for a few reasons:   The concept of ""At Risk"" which is to say that as a cyclist your are more at risk than a car. As a pedestrian you are more at risk than a cyclist. If a pedestrian walks into a cyclist or a cyclist runs into a car, even if it is specifically their fault, then the less at risk party is 100% liable. This means that cars are always watching out for bikes (and bikes, pedestrians) and through the transitive property of karma, everybody seems pretty mellow. Serious, the most road range I've ever witnessed is a soft sigh from a cyclist when a car cut them off. Bike lanes everywhere and relatively few hard stop signs (even for cars). They do this through roundabouts and markings that tell you to yield. There are lights but everybody must stop at them or you'll get hit by the crossing bikes, cars, trains, or buses. Very high awareness that you must always look both ways as you are traveling, in whatever mode you're travelling in. I've seen toddlers who couldn't even form sentences looking both ways.   The most dangerous place to cycle is where there are a lot of foreign tourists because they're not looking both ways and not observing the rules."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,DonBungalow,7,Sat Jun 13 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that in a city and culture that has been designed with bike traffic in mind, it works really well.   Victoria is not like that at all."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,PixelCanuck,3,Sat Jun 13 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"Amsterdam wasn't designed with bike traffic in mind. They've adopted pragmatic rules to promote biking (including tax incentives rather than tickets) and improve safety for everyone. They've done this in a way that completely eliminates the ""us versus them"" mentality that you see in cars and bikers in North America. It's not something that happens over night, but something that takes long term planning to be able to execute."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,DonBungalow,4,Sun Jun 14 07:17:03 2015 UTC,"Moved here from Kelowna, expecting to bike absolutely everywhere. Except Kelowna, from my view, seems to be way more bike friendly.

A friend of mine got a ticket a couple of years ago - $30 for not wearing a helmet - during ""cycling safety enforcement week."" Posthumously awarding them a penalty seems a little cold - like being convicted of suicide.  Cops don't seem to enforce infractions for cyclists on a sidewalk, as long as the cyclist is going fairly slow (under 15km/hr) and isn't causing accidents. Getting to and from trails requires riding on a sidewalk sometimes, and they're not going to bust kids playing with their bikes.  Edit: wording."

I was too lazy though and just kept cycling without a helmet"
VictoriaBC,39px1p,TechnicallyITsCoffee,6,Mon Jun 15 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"The level of traffic enforcement is probably a function of available police resources and priorities. Government services are strapped these days. When that happens, you have to assign your limited resources to the highest risk issues and priorities. I believe VicPD does their best to enforce traffic laws but more often than not are probably attending to more pressing matters and investigations (domestic violence calls, mental health issues, fights, burglaries/robberies in progress, homeless issues, etc...). While most people say they would like to see more enforcement of existing laws, I would bet those same people don't want to pay more in taxes for those services. Something has to give. I do agree with your observations however. Personally I'm happy with the level of traffic enforcement...Victoria is mostly gridlocked by slow drivers anyway, and I've been quite successful at avoiding the other weirdos on the road."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,chinbeardsareover,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"Government services are strapped these days. When that happens, you have to assign your limited resources to the highest risk issues and priorities.   Traffic crashes and casualties have been steadily dropping for years, so it makes sense to reassign police to enforcing other laws."
VictoriaBC,39px1p,HotterRod,7,Mon Jun 15 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"A few points you should consider:  1) If helmet laws were based on danger, occupants of vehicles would have to wear them before cyclist would.   This is a good article on how bicyclist shouldn't have to wear helmets. In it there is stats showing 58% of head injuries occurred to motorist, compared 6% for cyclists. So if we want RATIONAL laws, you should have to buckle up and wear a helmet while driving.   2) You complain about cyclists not following the rules and no enforcement, but I see it the other way. As a motorcyclist, cyclist and car driver, I think car drivers are the most dangerous people on the road.   Why? Because they are piloting a huge machine that is likely to cause damage to others. Why do you care if someone isn't wearing a helmet when it seems like every other person is driving through busy traffic while playing on their phones. I'd say at least 30% of drivers I see are touching their phone in some way when I pull up beside them.  Compare the consequences of texting while driving to riding without a helmet and I'd rather the enforcement was focussed on the activity that can kill other people, not just personal risk taking.   Finally, you complain about bikes almost hitting you, and while I agree that can be frustrating, it's not really putting you in the same danger as the same irresponsible person behind the wheel of a car. Maybe just be thankful for that?  Cheers,"
VictoriaBC,39px1p,sorss,5,Sun Jun 14 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"As a fellow motorcycle, car, cyclist traveler I agree entirely.  Although I do wear a helmet, if I didn't and ran into your car I may suffer and that's my problem.  If you're car meanders while eating a donut, drinking a coffee and rushing to get to your meeting and hits me, I'm dead.  I want law enforcement watching for the inattentive driver more than the ""un-helmeted"" cyclist."

VictoriaBC,39px1p,FigBug,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll bite. The police don't generally enforce the law because they have ""higher priorities"" - like catching actual criminals. For the same reason they don't ticket you doing 105 in 100 zone, it's counterproductive, and the police ( at least here ) aren't steaming vindictive morons. They have the support of the public, but robbing them over trivialities is good way to lose it and more importantly destroy public trust. The helmet law is a ""pretend"" solution - it does nothing useful, but was easy to legislate, and the government could give themselves a pat on the back for ""doing something"". Rigid enforcement would have one clear effect: a reduction in cycling. Public support for cycling improvements is then eroded, as a big chunk of ""the public"" -note not ""cyclists""  just won't wear them, they will just stop riding. I speak from experience, in Australia the participation rate for children pre-law was 80%. It's now 5%. Cycling dropped by 36% on average with enforcement. With a 90% drop in women under 20. Cyclists are now a hated ""subculture"" that get run off the road for fun. The rules of the road are written for motor vehicles, not bicycles. Any laws about bikes are an afterthought. Usually drawn up by those who don't ride. Writing legislation is hard enough without trying to predict every sensible exception, so we don't. We allow people to break them if harmless, and start enforcing them when problems arise. I ride to work several days a week. I break the law every time by riding on the footpath. I do this because it's a steep uphill with no shoulder and lots of traffic. Legally I'm supposed to be on the road. Legally, I'm allowed to be in the middle of the lane, pissing off hundreds of people. I don't do this because   1. it's dangerous  2. It's inconsiderate. Life requires us to be a little flexible, even when it comes to rules."

VictoriaBC,39px1p,Shawn68z,-1,Sat Jun 13 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely zero requirement for cyclists to be licensed.   They are expected to follow the rules of the road, but at no point does anyone actually ensure that they KNOW them.   At least drivers have to pretend."

VictoriaBC,39px1p,Shawn68z,2,Sat Jun 13 21:58:27 2015 UTC,That's a terrible assumption. A lot of people DON'T have licenses nowadays.
VictoriaBC,39px1p,PixelCanuck,2,Sun Jun 14 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"Icbc puts the number of cyclists that have a drivers licence at 83% for men, and low 70's for women.  Do a quick Google search, and most other countries are in the same range.  Found this too. I know its Alberta buts its a nice write up. http://bikecalgary.org/licensing"
VictoriaBC,39px1p,Shawn68z,-2,Sun Jun 14 03:53:53 2015 UTC,"How about teach kids in PE, I learned when I was a kid living in Ontario how to use a bike in traffic, its much safer here and no one gets on the road properly. People should know the roads are safe for them, I drive and bike. I'm more pissed with the cyclists in Victoria, any city driving a car is stupid and slow. That makes cars predictable and safer, our cyclists like to use the side walk and surprise traffic. Just include a bike ridding program in school, I had to take ultimate Frisbee as an elective, they wouldn't let me take any thing else. Frisbee doesn't save lives in traffic, can't we just teach kids how to ride there bikes! We would save lives, not the baby boomers, they made there choice, now there out of shape and that's too bad. I couldn't care less about helmet laws, I would just like to see adults riding in traffic, I would like too hear them actively choose that, so they can never ever own minivans or SUVs, every day at 4pm the road fills up with them and the traffic haults to a stop, meanwhile you'll have people ringing there bell to get you out of there way when your walking and they have a freaking bike, it should be treated like driving a motor scooter on the side walk. Hey at least scooters make enough sound to anouce them self's, you can't be on the side walk with a bike, its for drunk, high and the blind or disabled, its for walking. Years ago a mountain biker hit a woman who died in front of her grand kid, for what? To rip around the side walk like its a mountain, "" woooh major off roading bro! Get that walker out of the way I've got crack to deliver"""

I think if police started to actually crack down on side walk cyclists I would be vary vary happy. The issue is they don't want to have a police station full of street people and spoiled people.  I would be so happy if they figured out any one riding a bmx or mountain bike on the side walk is a drug dealer. But then we would need to take care of all those people, and we can't do that. I think they should just take all those bikes away, most people don't care about the laws here because they don't really apply to them. If you don't want a drivers license you don't have to pay a ticket for no helmet.... sorry for the tangent I just get really bothered that adults still can't bike for them self's and end up teaching there kids to be lazy useless things. Just take the bikes and sell them f they don't pay there ticket. Short of that, call people on there shit, this town is far to disconcerting."

VictoriaBC,39lo3d,f-a-p,2,Sun Jun 14 01:57:45 2015 UTC,"Ha, I completely agree with you. I always feel a bit bad about it, but I often launch into a rant when I walk around downtown and I see cool looking buildings in awesome spots that turn out to be senior's residences.  Why do they have to in the heart of the city? Isn't that less convenient for everyone? The seniors have to put up with the noise and bustle of the city... their families have to travel through downtown to get to them... and it's a lost opportunity to maybe add rental apartments for people who live and work in the city.  Maybe I'm wrong, and seniors LOVE being in the heart of the action. In which case, I'm an idiot and I'll shut up. But I'm not convinced.  Otherwise, I have no problem with the shape or size of this building. BUT it could look better. It seems pretty bland. I think it should either really emulate the historic architecture around it (it's a very different scope, but just up the street at Douglas and Superior there's a new set of townhouses that look like cool Victorian era row-houses. Why not something like that?)... or maybe this is Victoria's chance to put a crazy, bold, modern building up?"

You almost never get proper hot summer days in Victoria because there is always a breeze.  This is good for sleeping and just hanging out, but I miss the hot days when I am in Victoria.  Vancouver gets a shitton of rain.  There are many days each year where I wake up in the dark and it's raining.  I go to work and it's raining.  I come home in the dark and it's raining.

VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Brocket-99,7,Fri Jun 12 07:24:47 2015 UTC,Having a vasectomy doesn't lower testosterone levels.  Why would you think it does?
VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Bitter_Bert,-12,Fri Jun 12 07:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would think having your balls no longer producing testosterone for you would impact them, no?"
VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Brocket-99,8,Fri Jun 12 08:16:37 2015 UTC,Ah. You don't know what a vasectomy is.  Testes still produce testosterone.  They still make sperm too.  Only thing different is the tubes the sperm move through (vas deferens) are cut (or plugged) so they don't make it into the ejaculate.  After a vasectomy a man still ejaculates normally.  No noticeable difference in ejaculate quantity or quality.   Testosterone actually goes up slightly after.
VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Bitter_Bert,-11,Fri Jun 12 08:26:13 2015 UTC,"So a vasectomy manages to cut those tubes, but still have testosterone produced by the testes how?  Aren't there also different types of vasectomies? Some which replace the testicles with a prosthesis altogether, also?  The claim that testosterone goes up with a vasectomy should be met with some scepticism."
VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Brocket-99,11,Fri Jun 12 08:47:00 2015 UTC,I'm sorry that your sex education was obviously so lacking. There are many resources available on the internet. You really should know how the male body works better.
VictoriaBC,39j1bc,Bitter_Bert,6,Fri Jun 12 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"The delivery tubes (vas deferens) are cut, therefore, nothing in the production changes there is just a break in the delivery so you don't have sperm in your ejaculate. Everything else functions as per usual.   As the other posters mentioned, you should probably know a bit more about how this entire system works. Here is a link about vasectomies http://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy . You can always Google how the entire system works."

We aren't comparing negative effects as if they balance, we're comparing negative effects because it's inconsistent for government to police a substance due to its purported negative effects (of which many are unsubstantiated) and not police another despite volumes of substantiated negative effects."
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,Phruizler,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Not what I expected, you sound like a commendable person.  Politics is a game of compromises with messy inconsistent results- I do not consider it inconsistent to police cannabis if we understand alcohol itself would be better controlled but popularity prevents serious opposition to it"
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,UyhAEqbnp,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"You seriously want to make it so that when someone finishes their hard day's work, they can't come home to a beer if that's what they want to do?  Quit trying to control what people do with their body, if it does not affect you physically. Your right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose - should be the mentality.  If someone wants to drink beer because they like beer - let them drink it.  Beer is healthy in many respects, I think you are forgetting this.  BC has a bunch of binge drinking losers that can't handle their booze - they can't just have one drink - you guys are the worst province when it comes to holding your liquor."

The concept of ""a man as an island"" is in my opinion simply naive. Dealcoholized beer is actually significantly healthier for a person, and in my opinion the negative costs of alcohol almost certainly outweigh rather fleeting positives."
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,UyhAEqbnp,-3,Fri Jun 12 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"Have they done studies to measure what the effects of eating marijuana are on the brain vs. smoking?  I would also be interested to know what these studies say about marijuana and the supposed benefits to the brain it was alleged to have by other studies.  I would not be surprised if the study group was a bit small - wasn't it a comparison of 40 people total? 20 smokers, 20 non? and the changes in these people's brains could be accounted for perhaps due to use of other drugs - like mdma, cocaine, etc.  Or are they explicitly testing only users of marijuana?  Why did they decide to test these people at the 18-25 age group range? Isn't that kind of a sporadic, and less predictable age group, which still often has many changes occurring in their brain - many men aren't fully grown in height until their early 20s."
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,Brocket-99,-1,Thu Jun 11 08:55:29 2015 UTC,so you are essentially just second-guessing based on unverified assumptions and coloring it with bias
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,UyhAEqbnp,-5,Thu Jun 11 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just pointing out where the study could be flawed.  We do know it's a rather small group of people they studied, that's not unverified. We do know they were young, and we do know that many men don't mature fully at some of the ages tested.  We don't know if the test subjects are purely marijuana smokers, or their lifestyle habits.  I wouldn't say that the test was biased, but perhaps it wasn't funded enough? As the number of people studied was quite small.  Do you know the specifics of the study, and whether or not the marijuana smokers in the study also used other drugs? Because it is crucial in determining this studies validity - albeit just one component of determining this."

I'd prefer if they had used a larger sample group, and one that wasn't at such a young age - when changes are still going on in the brain.  I still have yet to be answered as to whether or not the marijuana test subjects used other drugs."
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,Brocket-99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the entire study so I don't know what they took into account (reducing other dependent variables). If you are doing statistics on a sample of a normally distributed population, you need a minimum of 30 to do a p-test. However, if you have a smaller sample of a normal distributed population, you can do an alternate test called the t-test. With the t-test, you have to look into whether it is a single tailed or double tailed t-test, which is excluding the ends of one or both sides of the bell curve.   tl/dr minimum 30 sample size for normal distributed population. Less than 30 uses a t-test."
VictoriaBC,39c9tl,tael89,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:43:05 2015 UTC,"I find the criteria for how many people are required to do a study, fairly low.  Should we not be monitoring larger groups of people, if we want to see a more accurate picture of our population?   The results you can get when choosing 30 people total can just be so skewed. In my experience, ""random"" selection, still has its flaws, making it not so random all the time.   As you can tell, I did not hang around for statistics 101 at uvic, dropping the course early, as I did not agree with the conclusions they were arriving at, nor did I agree with their methods of analysis. :P  I think they were always too keen to arrive at the conclusion they wanted, and subconsciously allowed this to influence their conclusions - when their results could actually have a myriad of reasons as to why the subjects answered the way they did, or how they did. And their subsequent behaviour may or may not be influenced by the statistic in analysis.  In short I found their conclusions contrived, and self-serving, using methods that were in my view ""the easy way"" to find what they wanted to, but make it look scientific.  You should read ""How To Lie With Statistics""."

When you see the cops parked on the side of the road, I think some of the time they are just scanning all the plates that go by.  They stated they have only 2 cars but I suspect its more than that."

I was very thankful, he still gave me the $109 fine but said if it's within a few days and it seems like an honest mistake they generally attempt to give benefit of the doubt.

VictoriaBC,398dev,VelvetJustice,8,Wed Jun 10 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"Just so it's clear the mayor isn't fibbing, here are the relevant sections from the current Victoria parks bylaw.   Definition of ""homeless person""   means a person who has neither a fixed address nor a predictable safe residence to return to on a daily basis;  14.1 A person must not do any of the following activities in a  park:   (d) take up a temporary abode over night;  16.1 A person may erect or construct, or cause to be erected or constructed, a tent, building or structure, including a temporary structure such as a tent, in a park only as permitted under this Bylaw, or with the express prior permission of the Council, 16A.1 Sub-section (2) applies despite the general prohibitions under section 14(1)(d) and section 16(1) of this Bylaw 16A.2 A homeless person must not place, secure, erect, use, or maintain in place, in a park, a structure, improvement or overhead shelter, including a tent, lean-to, or other form of overhead shelter constructed from a tarpaulin, plastic, cardboard or other rigid or non-rigid material:   (a) subject to sub-section (b), except between the hours of: (i) 7:00 o’clock p.m. of one day and 7:00 o’clock a.m. of the next day when Daylight Saving time is not in effect; and (ii) 8:00 o’clock p.m. of one day and 7:00 o’clock a.m. of the next day when Daylight Saving time is in effect, (b) at any time, in a playground, sports field, footpath, a road within a park, Bastion Square, environmentally sensitive area, or any area within a park that has been designated for an event or activity under a valid and subsisting permit issued under the authority of this Bylaw."
VictoriaBC,398dev,swabbie,8,Wed Jun 10 00:34:30 2015 UTC,TL;DR: The homeless really don't have a legal right to be using the parks because the shelters are not full.  The real problem is that the shelters mingle all walks of life together to deliver maximum resources at minimum cost. The expense of doing this is that some feel so unhappy about the mingling that they would rather not use the shelters.  I bet if you asked the public to get together to raise some money for building a 'drug free' transitional shelter for homeless that it would be a faster solution than a shanty town full of garden sheds.
VictoriaBC,398dev,RalphHinkley,5,Wed Jun 10 01:53:59 2015 UTC,We don't have to raise anything. Not having to pay the estimated $600k/yr for wakeup calls would pay off the cost of building housing.
VictoriaBC,398dev,elliam,2,Wed Jun 10 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"It's more than the wake-up service even. If a transitional housing facility can help target injured/disabled homeless, some who've sold/stored most of their possessions/stopped paying rent to get through treatment faster, we all win.   Ideally all the housing should be risk-free and feel safe, but I can empathize with the combination of mentally ill, drug users, and other folks all mingling about. Plus you have different goals for providing housing, especially if some people need job training to acquire a career they can tackle even with an injury or long term disability.   The statement, ""To really change, you need to really want to change."", probably applies more to people who see reasons to want to change. The option for improved housing/enhanced job training programs might be good incentive to stay sober/clean?  I am sure there is something that has been done and there is probably something planned, but this press is pointing out the need to hurry things up at the very least."
VictoriaBC,398dev,RalphHinkley,-1,Wed Jun 10 05:42:42 2015 UTC,? That's awkward but correct..?  It's saying homeless*(when the shelters are full) get the boot at 7am and likewise if they try to go snuggle in prior to 7pm they may get disturbed.
VictoriaBC,398dev,RalphHinkley,4,Wed Jun 10 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"I believe your TL;DR is incorrect.  There is nothing in the bylaw tying the legality of homeless camping in the park to the status of the shelters.  While the city was, in 2008, ordered by the BC Supreme Court to allow homeless to camp in parks if shelters are full, they opted go beyond that."
VictoriaBC,398dev,swabbie,3,Wed Jun 10 04:23:09 2015 UTC,"You aren't homeless if someone's offering you a dry warm bed for free.  Ergo if the law is that homeless are allowed, then the status of shelters are relevant.  In the case of several people interviewed they made the excellent point that the shelters are not really 'free' because you trade your dignity and peace of mind for a spot in a shelter with drug addicts and mentally ill strangers.  I just didn't get into it when summarizing, but have discussed it lower down."
VictoriaBC,398dev,RalphHinkley,2,Wed Jun 10 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"I have issues with you equating having a shelter bed for a night with having a home.  Generally transitory housing doesn't count.

Rather than argue what is, argue what should be."
VictoriaBC,398dev,swabbie,0,Wed Jun 10 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"Ahh I personally don't live that fancy and have a very simple set of belongings outside of work/frivolous toys. The idea of living under a tree rent-free is actually surprisingly appealing but I'm getting too old for it.  I know that a shelter would be a step down from the park life for me personally, at least in good weather with no insects. That's why I've been saying that I sympathize with people saying they don't have a home even with empty beds in shelters."
VictoriaBC,398dev,RalphHinkley,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think the perception among homeless people is that you, and your belongings are safer in the park than at the shelter.  Another reason shelters are disliked is that they have judgemental staff often that treat them like shit. They'd rather sleep in the park with some peace and quiet, than be crammed into a hospital like surrounding, with many other sick people.   Usually there is about a half an hour line to use the washroom at shelters.   So you can see why it isn't exactly the same ""warm bed"" that the connotation brings to mind.  If I had the choice, to be homeless for one night, in the shelter, or beacon hill park - I'd choose beacon hill park."

VictoriaBC,398dev,evade16,3,Wed Jun 10 22:50:22 2015 UTC,"So, in order to be able to afford a home we should have to share part of the domicile? I think you are missing the principle of the matter."
VictoriaBC,398dev,Caledonius,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:55:02 2015 UTC,first homes aren't easy to afford these days but I would rather be the landlord than the tenant. Plus if you get the right layout with a separate entrance non shred laundry its as though they are not even there. My point was that you dont need a 80k income to afford a house but to afford a house without 80k a year you have to make compromises.
VictoriaBC,398dev,evade16,2,Fri Jun 12 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"Again, you are dancing around the issue you know I am right about. The housing market is blown wayyyy out of proportion in this city making getting into a home exceptionally difficult for younger people. Especially given the job market. You can go to Alberta and work an entry level job and be able to afford a home, but in the city I was raised in I can not."
VictoriaBC,398dev,Caledonius,0,Wed Jun 10 01:19:34 2015 UTC,Such is the cost of living in one of the most desirable places in Canada. If you think victoria is expensive look at San Francisco.   Yes the market is over inflated but you need to find ways to get into the market so that the money you are spending on rent is money you are investing in your house and at the moment the best way to do that is find a property with rental income. Does it make the market fair that this is an option? No. But it is a way to get in the game and from there you can leverage the equity you have in your first house to buy a second house that doesn't need the rental income when able to.   You are saying you would rather not play the game and rent until the market changes to fit your economic situation allowing you to buy a house on your average income which is way more unreasonable than what I am saying.  The Alberta job market is insanely good. Go to VIU and get your certs to drive a dump truck and go there and make 100k a year but that is like comparing apples to oranges. Why does my neighbor get a porche 911 when all I can afford is a Honda civic.

We are a collection of particles that have achieved sentience; in that sentience we search for place and purpose. As a result of this we have built a society where everyone tries to look like they know what they're doing when in REALITY we are all just a few years away from dying and losing said sentience. Everything you have achieved is meaningless and everyone you ever cared about will die.

The two local environment canada sites are UVic http://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-66_metric_e.html and the Airport http://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-85_metric_e.html  There is also this for one brand of home weather stations. https://www.netatmo.com/weathermap
VictoriaBC,3976xz,jjc551,4,Tue Jun 9 19:45:24 2015 UTC,The schoolnet sensors are really helpful as Victoria has a ridiculous amount of microclimates.  I've experienced being snowed in when other areas didn't even get a dusting.  It's very normal for summer temperature at your home to exceed the measured official weathernetwork type reported high.
VictoriaBC,3976xz,orangeisthebestcolor,3,Tue Jun 9 22:05:53 2015 UTC,Yeah the school based weather system is by far the most accurate way for your specific area. as i think the major ones are all near water/out at the airport which doesn't really 'help' as they are quite removed/exposed to other factors.
VictoriaBC,3976xz,bntly,5,Tue Jun 9 20:22:37 2015 UTC,Official weather stations are enclosed and in the shade which is why they are so much lower than what we expect.
VictoriaBC,3976xz,doggyStile,5,Tue Jun 9 19:44:41 2015 UTC,This. Weather stations are designed to a scientific standard. Using them for casual personal use is a byproduct not the design intent.  Standing in the full sun on concrete will feel way hotter than reported by a station.

VictoriaBC,396r7r,NWSanta,14,Tue Jun 9 17:37:48 2015 UTC,I think one contibuting factor is the lack of a third lane.  Your either in the right lane with people who stop to turn right.  Or you have people turning left later on down the road (pat bay for example)  there's no true travel lane.
VictoriaBC,396r7r,Sunray21A,8,Tue Jun 9 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"this is absolutely true on the Pat Bay, there are a ton of left exits that cause a LOT of slow traffic in what would otherwise be the passing lane"
VictoriaBC,396r7r,nessman69,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"The lack of left and right turn lanes on many roads crossing Mackenzie can really slow down traffic there too, and it is already bad within a few blocks of Quadra as it is."

VictoriaBC,396r7r,wrgrant,5,Tue Jun 9 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"Sadly, a lot of places in Victoria that had a third lane are losing it, and those that had two are going down to one. Look at the recent changes to Cook St (or the Cook St Highway as I call it). From Finlayson down to Quadra it used to be 2 lanes, now its one broad lane with very weir raised curbs/sides.

The single laneing has caused alot of congestion in the area between Maplewood and Finlayson on Cook.

The 3 lanes have very little to do with it, as most vehicles will either go to the left lane, or the middle leaving the right lane mostly empty. Then just before memorial/langford exit, vehicles will then cut accross 2-3 lanes of traffic and slam on their brakes to make the exit.  There has acouple of accidents lately because of this behavour."

VictoriaBC,396r7r,rednightmare,2,Tue Jun 9 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"3 lane highways are a different beast, but the Deerfoot has way too many exits crammed together, and nobody can merge properly.  On the #1 outside of the city, and even Stoney Trail, people consistently just hang out in the left lane. Heck, it wasn't until 2010 that they even got the ""Keep Right Unless Passing Lane"" signs.  I will GLADLY drive in any other city I've been to over Calgary. I hate that place."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,wrgrant,12,Tue Jun 9 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Victoria's highways are a clusterfuck in general. Think about the Pat Bay and how there are so many left turns off of it going in either direction. People don't want to miss their turn, so they get in early or when it is safe to do so and then they don't maintain a passing speed on their way to the turn."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,Numerolophile,3,Tue Jun 9 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, and sometimes people are dicks about letting you merge. If we had a consistent 3 lanes everywhere and good exits everywhere we could have a smoother flow."

VictoriaBC,396r7r,_Sinusoidal,5,Tue Jun 9 18:39:15 2015 UTC,"I drive above the speed limit, but often people go faster than me - I ALWAYS notice them gaining speed and try to get over to the right lane. But the people in the right lane are oblivious, and it takes me forever to get over (I'm probably more cautious than average with finding a big enough gap).  But when the gap comes, before I get the chance, the person behind me moves to the right lane and speeds up to pass me that way -- because they are behind, the gap sometimes reaches them before me. So I still can't move over!  I wish we could talk to each other, so I can say ""hey I'm going to move, hang on""...."

""I don't know the high traffic act in every province""  and.. ""unless preparing to turn left."" which is how victoria's highways are built dipshit.  If you want to act aggressive about this, I bet you're one of the types of drivers that enters a crosswalk when there is still a pedestrian in it? That's against the law, but I bet you still do it. Should I curse and swear you out for it? It's sure as hell a more dangerous habit than driving in the left lane, when our highways have left turns."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,james121345,2,Wed Jun 10 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"^ Bad example, it's actually not against the law. As long as the pedestrian is not near your side of the road it's perfectly legal to enter the crosswalk."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,stevo911_,-1,Wed Jun 10 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"I was taught it was against the law. I guess I was taught wrong. However it's still a bad and more dangerous driving habit. When you start moving from a crosswalk you are indirectly telling other drivers that the crosswalk is clear even if it's not.  How about inching your way thru a right turn because you're waiting for a pedestrian. Your entering the intersection when it is not clear to do so. ""Owning"" the intersection for a left turn is also illegal. You are stopped in the middle of an intersection. And entered it when it was not clear to do so."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,james121345,3,Wed Jun 10 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"Inching through intersection while waiting on pedestrians no.  Pulling into an intersection to make a left turn, before it's clear to turn is totally legal and the correct way to turn, providing you're not impeding traffic from any other direction.  If there's another car in the intersection ahead of you waiting to turn left you have to wait behind the stop line.  Once there is a gap to turn, or the light turns yellow or red, you complete your turn.   Sounds like your teacher needs a little review"

VictoriaBC,396r7r,chinbeardsareover,-4,Wed Jun 10 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"And again, I said it doesn't apply here because his argument is based off of the ontario traffic act, which the BC traffic act has yet to be brought up, or even cited. So until then, the videos are more ""informational when travelling to ontario,"" than this is the law in BC.  It's not impeding traffic. Why are you in the left lane, if there is no one on the road, or to the right? You're using the left lane as a travel lane if you're in it, when there is no reason for you to be. You would be just as wrong.  As well, as getting angry over such a petty thing is more dangerous than travelling in the left lane. http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun05/anger.aspx  http://www.dmv.org/how-to-guides/driving-and-emotions.php  http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/gju/Underwood_Papers/transres.1999.pdf  As I said to another commenter, you're getting your panties in a bunch about someone else's, non-dangerous, driving habits.

We all have a responsibility to look out for each other on the road and to drive in a safe and efficient manner.

You are not blocking the normal flow of traffic by driving in the left lane. Especially if the only traffic you're blocking, is going well over the posted speed limit.   The laws of physics apply in all provinces    Nobody said anything about the laws of physics, so what does that have to do with anything?   the intent of the laws are exactly the same. BC isn't special   Actually, you are either completely misinformed, or blatantly lying. Traffic laws vary from province to province - it is not exactly the same across all provinces.   No one is getting angry,   and i quote you right here: "" GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAYYY!""   Edit: And to add on even further. It's not impeding traffic if you are going the maximum speed allowed on the road, and buddy behind you gets pissed off because he wants to go the speed limit. If it's such an annoyance, pass on the right. It'll be just another ticket added on top of your speeding ticket."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,james121345,4,Wed Jun 10 04:26:40 2015 UTC,"You are not the police. It is not your job to enforce the speed limit.

It's very simple."

VictoriaBC,396r7r,nrtphotos,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"IMO that's much too long to wait, if the highway isn't congested and they aren't passing the right lane with a decent speed difference then it's time to start honking. One of the first rules of multi-lane highways is don't go the same speed as the lane beside you."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,just_quit_smoking,6,Thu Jun 11 22:59:03 2015 UTC,no surprises that you are getting downvoted on this subject. the pat bay is full of airheads who cruise in the left lane at the speed limit or below while talking on their cellphones or daydreaming. the space cadets that do this should take a trip to europe and see what happens when you act like a self entitled cunt on the highway.

VictoriaBC,396r7r,stevo911_,-3,Tue Jun 9 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, what I am getting really sick of is being in the right lane behind multiple cars/trucks doing 60 in an eighty zone, pulling out to pass them and accelerating to 80 (the speed limit) and some dillweed behind me that comes up behind me doing a hundred, and rides my ass while honking at me while I'm in the left lane trying to pass.  The left lane is not for speeding, speeding is against the law, this should be common sense.  EDIT: Boy, a lot of you really hate following the rules of the road.  I hope you learn how to drive properly before you hurt yourself or others."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,Tal-IGN,4,Thu Jun 11 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"It may not be for speeding, but if you're impeding the flow of traffic in the passing lane, you should probably speed up more, or move over:  Copied directly from drivesmartbc: ""If you are driving in the left hand lane and you are driving at a speed less than normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing, you must drive in the right hand lane if it is practical to do so. It is important to note that the words speed limit do not appear anywhere in the last sentence. If you are slower, move over. If you choose not to, you are at risk of being ticketed for failing to keep to the right unless it is unreasonable to do so.""  If you pulled out in front of a car doing more than the speedlimit who ""zips up behind you"", you just performed an unsafe manoever, speed up more, or stay out of the way."

VictoriaBC,396r7r,GameAddikt,2,Wed Jun 10 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, because I knew people defending their actions would latch on to that little bit.  It's pass someone slower than you.  Not pull out, pass a whole bunch of people going 2kph slower than you, and let a parade of traffic behind you build up, while you impede the flow of traffic.  If you're passing more than a couple cars your travelling in the passing lane while impeding traffic."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,stevo911_,-1,Wed Jun 10 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"It is, in no way an unsafe maneuver because I'm not just winging out in front of them and cutting them off, I am putting my signal on, checking my mirror, shoulder checking and, seeing that there are no cars in close or unsafe proximity to the area in which I plan on occupying, I am pulling out into the lane which is open and unoccupied and perfectly safe, then, maintaining my speed, which is at the lawful limit, I pass the slower traffic and then maneuver back into the right lane when it is safe to do so.  The fact that these people come speeding down the highway doing 100+ km/h when I've already made my perfectly safe maneuver is not my fault nor is it my problem, I'm lawfully occupying the left hand lane with the intent to pass, which I do, it just takes a couple of seconds and these people, who are an exception and in no way are the definition of the ""normal speed of traffic"" decide that they don't want to drive the proper limit for any matter of seconds and think that by honking at me and maintaining an unsafe distance between my rear and their front bumper that this will then in turn force me to then mimic their actions and drive in an unsafe manner, which it will not, all they are doing is endangering themselves and anybody else around them on the highway.   Also, since I clearly stated, in all of my comments, that the reason for me being in the left hand lane is that I am passing another driver, who is, assumably, occupying some form of highway legal transportation, is it not safe to assume that it would, therefore, be unsafe for me to return to occupying the right hand lane while they are still occupying it beside me?   Speed up more, or stay out of the way.   You should not be driving."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,pixelwork,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, the way it reads I pictured one of the dweebs who just pulls out in front of 100kph traffic, going 60, and creeps up to the speed limit, and stays there , while traffic piles up behind them, and is ""passing"" traffic on their right, going MAYBE 5kph faster than the slow lane."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,GameAddikt,2,Wed Jun 10 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"You're trying to pass people by staying under the speed limit...  You're upset at people going 100 on an 80 highway in the left lane...

VictoriaBC,396r7r,GameAddikt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"Passing someone by going 80 is unsafe, takes way too long, and impedes the normal flow of traffic. If you can't pass properly then stay in the right lane."

If you're speeding and passing people constantly you're not in the normal flow of traffic.

If there are 50 cars behind you wanting to go 100, you're impeding the normal flow of traffic, regardless of if they're speeding or not.  PS.

VictoriaBC,396r7r,GameAddikt,-1,Tue Jun 9 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Had this happen on my way back from nanaimo a couple weeks ago. There is usually no need to bitch about people going ""too slow"" in the passing lane because they're going the speed limit."

If you are that easy to anger behind the wheel of a killing machine going 100kmh, you need help. I don't care whether someone is going to slow for you or in the wrong lane.

VictoriaBC,396r7r,james121345,3,Tue Jun 9 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"Whereas endangering others by parking in the passing lane is OK? Some people have short fuses, that's a fact of life. If you're sitting in the passing lane for 15km, doing 70kph in a 90 zone (like some knob did this AM on the pat bay), effectively turning the highway into 1 lane (as they filter around you on the right) obviously people are going to get rattled. I'm a pretty calm person but I was pretty annoyed this morning, if you can't drive the speed limit (at the very least) for the love of god, take the backroads, or get in the slow lane."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,stevo911_,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:09:08 2015 UTC,Nobody said anything about parking in the passing lane. Or going under the speed limit. Go take your argument to someone who cares

VictoriaBC,396r7r,GameAddikt,-2,Wed Jun 10 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"You take it out of context. Why is buddy in the left lane if no one is the right? No reason for either of them to be in the left lane, you have no reason to bitch if you're doing the same thing. As well its not endangering anyone, it's not dangerous driving. It's just bad driving.

I've seen people run red lights in the opposite direction lanes because they were pissed.  You never know when you're slowing down a crazy idiot, and it's better, IMO, to just take the necessary precautions to not make these people any crazier than they already are."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,Great68,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"So much this.  If I'm continually passing people, I do not have to get out of the left lane to let you speed up to 130 km/h.  Many drivers don't seem to understand this and honestly in my experience it's just as much a problem as people occupying the left lane for no reason.   The left lane does not equal ""go my speed or get out of my way""    edit: since I don't think i was clear enough in my original post and I'm getting downvoted because people think i'm endorsing a certain behaviour that I did not intend to endorse, I'll try and clarify what I was referring to:  I'm not talking about chilling in the left lane when it's possible to be in the right lane, while a line of cars accumulates behind you. I'm talking about a very specific situation that has happened to me multiple times where I'm speeding myself and I'm passing a line of cars (and thus couldn't even safely get back into the right lane even if I wanted to), and then ONE car comes out of nowhere and tailgates the shit out of me because they want to go 130, and me and all the cars in front of me are only going 100.  If you are one car, and the entire left lane needs to get out of your way to let you pass, then you are the one who is not following the flow of traffic."
VictoriaBC,396r7r,Tal-IGN,3,Tue Jun 9 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"The left lane does not equal ""go my speed or get out of my way""    Yes it can.  If you are travelling in the left lane at what is considered less than ""normal"" speed of traffic at the time, that does NOT necessarily equal the speed limit of the highway. IE:  If everyone else in the left lane is doing 100, and you pull out doing 80, you need to move over if there is room in the right lane to do so.    Basically, if you're in the left lane with clear road ahead of you and a line of cars behind you, you are going too slow in the left so move the fuck over.

I don't know why I'm getting downvoted and you're getting upvoted.  The article literally confirms my post.  It says people in the process of passing are exempt from having to give way to drivers behind them!  Which is kind of self-evident as you can't change lanes while you're passing a car, can you?  But regardless, I'm not talking about chilling in the left lane while a line of cars accumulates behind you.

It's even worse when that person waits for an insanely small gap and passes you on the right, almost killing everyone, just to tailgate the car in front of you.

It mostly lists the various peaks to climb, but the routes to lots of them lead past excellent lakes where there is some camping available.  Search around through the route listings for Grassie Lake, Peden Lake, and Sheilds Lake.  Peden Lake has a small cabin on it that's pretty run down but you can sleep in it.  You could also pitch a tent right next to it.  Beautiful spot with only like a 90 minute hike.  Grassie Lake has a spot of land that you could put one or two tents on and it's quite nice.  Couple hours of hiking to get there.  Sheilds Lake is a bit of a longer walk, but it's a pretty big lake and there's at least 2 spots that I've hiked by that could easily accomodate multiple tents.  Some people will tell you that formally speaking, the area is off limits to everyone.  But there's hundreds of well-worn and decently marked trails in there, so it's actually fine to hike and camp in there.  Be respectful of the environment, and leave a good plan with someone.  I volunteer with the Search and Rescue in the area, and if you don't come home and no one knows where you were, it's a big area to search.  Cheers!"

VictoriaBC,396fjt,mikeball,0,Tue Jun 9 17:29:42 2015 UTC,My only comment would be that central saanich is more like a 30-35 minute commute if leaving between 6:30-8am and returning between 4 and 5 pm.  during slower times more like 20 minutes.  Gordenhead / McKenzie area of saanich is 15 minutes to downtown
VictoriaBC,396fjt,TechnicallyITsCoffee,13,Tue Jun 9 17:31:08 2015 UTC,If you don't work in Langford stay away from it. The commute into Victoria gets worse by the day. Every new development is cramming thousands of news houses into that area with no responsibility to the infrastructure. I lived in Langford for 3 years and just moved to saanich. I'll never go back.

VictoriaBC,396fjt,danma,7,Thu Jun 11 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"at $450,000 I would go south Esquimalt unless something really jumped out.  6-7 minutes drive to downtown 5 minute walk to the ocean. nearby grocery and decent schools. that house on gore street is a 5 minute walk to the grocery\liquor\dry cleaners\bakery\rec centre with pool\, 2 minute walk to an elementary school and a couple minutes to the ocean.  6 minutes driving to downtown.  Can't tell garage situation but yard looks fenced. Likely needs some love. Has a 1 bedroom suite plus 3 bedrooms uptop.  If you don't want the rental income it's great for guests coming to visit from terrible Saskatchewan :)  http://www.century21.ca/dreams/Property/BC/V9A5B4/Victoria/510_Gore_St  Some places along the gorge/Tillicum area are pretty nice but the area is a bit less friendly in my experience.(I'm not a huge fan of the schools in this area but thought I'd put an example down)  http://www.realtor.ca/Residential/Single-Family/15632380/590-Vincent-Ave-Victoria-British-Columbia-V9A2G9    You can find the odd place in oaklands\fernwood near 450k with 3 bedroom 2 bath and a decent sized fence yard ~5000-6000 sqft.  The house will be a 50's place most likely, so kind of closed floor plan and not a ton of storage, very practical houses built in that era. The double garage is likely the biggest limiting factor in your search if oaklands/fernwood is desired, it rarely gets to 0 degrees here so if you think you can live without the garage that could help quite a bit kind of a busy street http://www.realtor.ca/Residential/Single-Family/15340119/1430-Bay-St-Victoria-British-Columbia-V8R2A8  I presume all these places need a little love but just kind of an example of something in each area currently available Langford is great if you are able to work from home.  Otherwise the rush hour commute can be an hour each way.  Sidney/central saanich the commute is more like 30 minutes in rush hour.  I haven't lived that way so can't speak much for it."

Next to downtown, next to the ocean, nice parks and facilities. Yeah it's right beside the navy base but that doesn't bother me.  I guess stigma around Esquimalt as the wrong side of the tracks is still strong... but I've never had a problem.  Granted, the main road is still ugly as fuck... but I think it's in the process of gentrification.  Also, I grew up on the Saanich Peninsula and it was a fantastic place to be a kid.

VictoriaBC,396fjt,moral_mercenary,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:07:54 2015 UTC,I'll chime in again and say South-West Saanich is also a good place to focus on (IMO). It's one of those places I also would have discounted until I rented there. We ended up buying a house about three minutes from where we rented. To me being able to avoid Hwy One is huge! Interurban/Burnside East doesn't get near the amount of traffic. Wilkinson can get a bit backed up in the afternoon though.
VictoriaBC,396fjt,Iamonabike,2,Tue Jun 9 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"Wilkinson can get a bit backed up in the afternoon though.   That's an understatement.    South West Saanich is my top pick for sure, it's just not a lot is available in that price range."
VictoriaBC,396fjt,BarkingOven,2,Tue Jun 9 21:29:50 2015 UTC,"I've lived in View Royal my whole life and love it. It's between Langford/Colwood and Esquimalt and more residential (so no nearby restaurants really, or at least they are few are far between) but it's always felt safe and quiet, especially by the water. You still get stuck in the Colwood crawl, but there are more alternative routes than you could take from Langford (ie the Gorge waterway which is rather pretty to drive by) and you skip out the majority of the crawl anyways just because you're closer to town.  There's a elementary and middle school in the middle of View Royal, but the highschools require driving/bussing/biking(on a bike path potentially). There's not a fitness centre in View Royal that I know of (unless they're small), but the Juan de Fuca rec center is very close and along the bike trail (the Galloping Goose). They're also building a new shopping centre by the Victoria hospital which could possibly have a gym (?). And there is a local business in town which teaches rhythmic gymnastics, if that's something you're interested in (?). I don't think there's any dedicated gymnastics in town. The house I live in is across the street from the water with everything you want for ~$500000 so I'm guessing you could find something for your price range. The things I love about View Royal in particular is how quiet it is, how close it is to the ocean and Thetis lake (I can walk from my house and around the lake with my dogs no problem), and how close it is to the bike trail (and they're building a new trail, the Rail Trail, through View Royal right now). The Galloping Goose goes downtown and let's you skip the traffic, or out to Sooke along the coast which is a beautiful ride. I know it's maybe not what you were thinking of in terms of area, but it could be a possibility."

For example, within Victoria proper, there are tons of small post-war 2 bed + 1 bath houses; the size of place you typically wouldn't see in SK.

James Bay is about as comfortable as Sidney, and it's in easy range to downtown where most things are. James Bay has some very nice old houses, is more safe and peaceful that most areas, and is a bit higher class. It's got cozy corner stores and relaxing beaches.  Sidney is more quite, and by my tastes a bit more comfortable. It takes more time to get to the convenience of downtown of course, but not too long since the highway is right there heading straight where you want to go. Sidney is very safe and quiet, has better beaches, more receptive people due to the sparsity, and it's arguably a better to start a family. It has most things you'd need in its stores, and some entertainment such as bowling and a little theatre. Better view of the sky, less people, more places to explore, good range of houses from big to small; inexpensive(ish) to overly fancy."

VictoriaBC,393ebo,RalphHinkley,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:15:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly.. As I recall there's an overhead for getting into old growth areas + problems with the timber that relegate it to waste uses. I'm sure they would rather go after a replanted zone than old growth for several reasons, including negative press.  I'm sure there will be some more press feeding off the story for money, and more protesting out of lack of knowledge, but ultimately there will be some fact delivery and the work will get done in a managed fashion with way too many eyes overseeing it."
VictoriaBC,393ebo,Ikeren,0,Wed Jun 10 00:44:12 2015 UTC,It's cheaper (and thus more profitable) to cut down and remove fewer larger trees as opposed to more numerous smaller trees. That's why old growth gets logged.
VictoriaBC,393ebo,RalphHinkley,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've only grown up with a logger as my source. He didn't own the company or balance the books. That said you have access roads and skid lines that make access easier, more consistent tree size/quality(easier to mark/limb/sort), and lot less chance of hitting something that requires you to stop and move around it. I've heard so many stories of crazy things that have kept crews grounded for a week+ waiting to get back on the job. Usually bones/burials that look native so you can't disturb them until they are checked. Even coming across a bear den with a pregnant/new mom can be a long-delay show stopper to properly plan out."
VictoriaBC,393ebo,Ikeren,2,Wed Jun 10 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"I work in forestry too, and it's true. It's easier to log second growth, and there is always a risk of a slow down. But minute/profit ratio for old growth is higher, which is why companies go after it. I don't think it's good either, just explaining why."
VictoriaBC,393ebo,RalphHinkley,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm wallowing in the virtual points penalty box because I made it clear that with the right approval, following the necessary planning/environmental reviews including some 3rd party oversight, the company should be allowed to remove the old-growth timber from the non-protected zones.   I'd expect these areas to come at an increased cost to pay for additional land management and oversight of the operations too. It's easier to collect on fines/prevent further problems before the logging is completed.   If we want to back out on the decision to permit the logging we'd need to do so with some concessions that I don't think anyone wants to make.   Heck while we're throwing around possible scenarios, for all we know some of the key protesters/media are paid for by the logging company so that they can get bought out of the permit vs. do the work! The idea that the logging companies are evil is really popular so nobody would put it past them to realize they can make more money and save time/resources with fake protesting!  It could even be an insurance scam! Tow in a bunch of equipment with mechanical issues, set fire to it all, blame the pesky protesters! Those evil logging companies! We can't pay them anything!

VictoriaBC,393ebo,iknowwhereiam,2,Tue Jun 9 06:16:32 2015 UTC,"Vancouver Island is a bit weird when it comes to logging/ forest practices. From what I understand, a huge part of this goes back to the days of Coal Mining/Robert Dunsmuir who bought up a ton of land surrounding his many extensive railways. Over the years, the land was sold off privately to forest companies.   As a result there is very little ""Crown Land"" on Vancouver Island. In most of the province, forest companies have to apply for and pay a fee to lease a plot of land an cut down the trees. On Vancouver Island companies in the past such as MacMillan Bloedel bought up huge chunks of forested land. Over the years, these companies have been bought and sold and merged, and split into all sorts of companies (there are dozens, you can google it).   So, now if one of these companies wants to log a chunk of their land, they are completely within their rights to do so, and as long as they are following government approved forest practices (ie. protecting creeks with riparian management etc.), then they can really do whatever the heck they want.   The ONLY way around this, as far as I can see, is for a group of people to get together, raise some money, and buy back the land from the forest companies. Unfortunately, you would probably have to pay more than the company stands to make through logging."

You have to use Internet Explorer and download Silverlight if you haven't got it.  You'd probably have to go through the provincial government (Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations) to find property information. The DataBC Data Distribution Service is where people download government spatial data (GIS Data) but you would need a GIS program such as ArcGIS to read the data as I think its only available as Geodatabase, Shapefile, or Coverage.

VictoriaBC,392b6f,Kaffarov,14,Mon Jun 8 19:13:23 2015 UTC,What a bunch of little cunts.
VictoriaBC,392b6f,lemonp0p,29,Mon Jun 8 20:15:07 2015 UTC,Its a shame the police aren't going to follow up on this one.  I thought all the buses had cameras on them?  No wonder half the transit staff are so miserable.
VictoriaBC,392b6f,hatmatter,92,Mon Jun 8 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"First off, this whole incident is despicable.  There is, however, some misinformation being bandied about.  Part of the challenge with this story is that Global started reporting on it without confirming any details with us, or with BC Transit.   The youths who are alleged to have committed this act were not ""put on the bus"" by us. The bus in question was a 72, headed southbound into Victoria. It is not, as reported, common practice for police to put 30-40 intoxicated youth on a bus.   Secondly, Global initially reported that ""police were investigating"" without talking to us. From talking to BC Transit, the driver discovered the horror after crossing over into our jurisdiction after the youth left the bus. My understanding is that she wisely sought medical attention, and then went home, likely to shower.   The driver did not file a report with us at the time.   We cannot investigate a complaint without someone making a complaint first. If she does make a complaint, we'll investigate, because that's really, really gross. But to claim that we ""won't investigate"" is simply not accurate.  Dislcaimer: /u/osoko here. Cst. Mike Russell, our regularly scheduled redditor, is off."
VictoriaBC,392b6f,VicPDCanada,23,Mon Jun 8 20:53:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment. It's a shame journalists can't communicate as effectively as you can.
VictoriaBC,392b6f,hatmatter,15,Mon Jun 8 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"I was surprised that they would make a statement like that, it really makes VicPD look bad, but I guess Global isn't exactly known for good journalism.  I hope she files a formal complaint and gets the ball rolling on finding these little shits.  I think most people in this town greatly appreciate the solid work that Transit drivers do, which is why this city is the only one I've ever seen to have passengers thank the driver when they exit.  Thank your drivers!  They're doing a thankless job"

VictoriaBC,392b6f,perogies,5,Tue Jun 9 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I suspect a bus driver (even a male one) would have little chance against 40 drunk douchebags.

Watching the sun set into the Pacific isn't something you get to see from Victoria, with the hills to the West. Do note that it's often cooler in that area that other site on the Eastern side of Vancouver Island.  MacDonald Park near Sidney is too close to the Pat Bay and road noise for my tastes.  EDIT: re-read you question and caught the bit about showers. Pretty sure Goldstream has showers. But I don't think China of French Beach do."

VictoriaBC,3923o0,TechnicallyITsCoffee,3,Mon Jun 8 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a boat yet. You clearly aren't ready. Cruising around the islands isn't cruising around a lake and you will die if you're not prepared.  Take some lessons. Go to power squadron and take their introductory coursing.  After that, if you still want a boat take their intermediate coursing.  After that, if you still want a boat get your radio operators certificate.  After that, if you feel you're qualified to skipper a vessel come back we'll talk specifics (Though I'd recommend their advanced seamanship courses first).  I'm serious, this is the basics, for 'cruising around', don't be one of 'those guys'.   http://www.victoriasquadron.ca/"
VictoriaBC,3923o0,actuallychrisgillen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, those had been recommended to me already.  I was planning on taking http://www.victoriasquadron.ca/courses/introductory-courses/boating-essentials.html  I presume when taking the course I'll be able to talk to them about other safety related topics and they can provide further recommendations.  I hadn't even thought about having a boat with a radio but that probably makes sense.  Was more trying to decide of a 12-18 foot aluminum boat vs a 16 foot-18 foot fibreglass boat.  I had been leaning towards a more basic aluminum boat so less could break but wasn't sure how much that would limit what I could do as far as: a) visiting the gulf islands b) fishing \ sight seeing a long the coasts around Victoria  I think primarily we would just be fishing around Esquimalt, there is that kind of bay between Esquimalt and Metchosin.  I mostly wanted to be able to go and there and fish (hopefully there is fish in that area).  The two biggest trips I would like to be able to do as an added bonus would be from the Swartz bay area to saltspring, and from crofton to saltspring."
VictoriaBC,3923o0,actuallychrisgillen,2,Tue Jun 9 00:00:05 2015 UTC,"Well both of those are very basic as far as boats go. Certainly for bobbing around in the bay they'll be adequate. You mention a bay around Esquimalt and Metchosin, I assume you're referring to Esquimalt harbour. It's a very sheltered bay, but it's a controlled access zone under military rules (check the applicable chart for specifics). Of course you can contact QHM on channel 10 to arrange transit, but that requires you having a ROC(M). It also can have a fair bit of traffic, so keeping your head up is advised.  Realistically, on a calm day you could drive a boat to Saltspring or other Gulf Islands, but it would be a couple of hours on the water on an uncovered boat. Can get unpleasant fast.  have a suspicion you'd be looking for a cruiser (what most people drive around here), before long. Before driving to Saltspring you need some serious experience in these waters, those are some heavily travelled waters including multiple ferry routes that you are crossing.   Also you are required to carry the appropriate charts at all times, and if you don't know how to read them... well I'm not joking in my opening post. Discussing boats right now is like discussing wedding plans while still single. Fun, but ultimately pointless."
VictoriaBC,3923o0,Iamonabike,3,Tue Jun 9 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're only going out in good conditions (and check the marine forecast ahead of time, and continuously!), you can get away with a simple 10'-12' open ""rowboat"" style boat with a 9.9hp engine. You can do everything you want in that in calm weather.  Don't worry about fiberglass vs. aluminum, either will be fine if you maintain it. When you get into bigger boats, then the price gap starts to widen, but you'll have many other things by that point you'll want to take into consideration.  Keep in mind how many people will be going out in it, and that will be one starting factor in determining how big of a boat you need.  People will inevitably say that boats are a big hole in the water you throw money into, and that can be very true. Keep up with regualr maintenance, flush the salt water out of the engine after every use, clean the boat hull and interior after use (see a trend here), and it won't be too bad. Sometimes you just get unlucky though.  Edit: Oh, and take a proper marine safety and navigation course."
VictoriaBC,3923o0,Iamonabike,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"Most of my experience boating is on a lake with a aluminum boat probably around that 12 foot mark and a 6hp engine.  I think to start anyways we would be looking for something similar but maybe bigger.  We had kind of just wanted to fish around the coast of the island near Esquimalt area.    But then it might make sense to get something a little fancier if it could get us from Vancouver island to saltspring.  Although I think we would likely be going from Crofton to the Vesuvius side.    I kind of like just the outboard on the back that you control from there since it seems like it really limits what can ""break"" on the boat.  Although it would be nice to have 2 motors, like a 4-10hp and a 40-70hp so you can get around a bit quicker when using the boat on the lake \ for redundancy if we run into trouble.  Having rowed a boat a couple kilometers on a lake I cannot imagine trying to do it in the ocean."
VictoriaBC,3923o0,Great68,3,Mon Jun 8 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"I personally won't go smaller than 16'. If your venturing any sort of distance, get a boat that you can mount a kicker on. There're good for fishing, as they use less gas, and will keep your speed down if you have a larger engine. They will also bail you out if you break down. It's happened to me a couple times, and it's happened once to almost almost everyone I know. You think it's hard paddling a boat a couple km's in lake? Try doing it against the wind/currents in the ocean. You can't. You pull out your VHF that you always have with you and start calling for a tow. I've done that once too when both motors died. I was only 500m from the marina, could have paddled, but a strong wind said it was going to push me away from it instead."

Victoria and Esquimalt are certainly far safer than Winnipeg. Victoria does face large amounts of social welfare issues on our streets, and we do get our fair share of low-level property crime that are often associated with this type of social disorder. If you're concerned about what crime is actually here, we have a crime map you can subscribe to:  https://vicpd.ca/public-safety/crime-prevention/crime-reports/"
VictoriaBC,38u96b,VicPDCanada,0,Sun Jun 7 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"I've got an unrelated question for you. Going down Government from downtown towards Gorge/Hillside, there is a sign at Chatham that says ""NEW...end 40 km/h"". Gorge/Hillside are 40 zones, before Chatham is 40, and the new rules state that 40 is the limit unless otherwise specified...what is the speed limit between gorge and Chatham. It doesn't explicitly state what the speed limit is (there are no speed limit signs), so the new rules would mean that it's a 40 zone... But the sign at Chatham states that the 40 ends (but it doesn't tell you what the limit is), so does that mean it's a 50 zone?  Is this area not actually part of Vic proper, even though it is surrounded by Vic Proper. The new limit goes up gorge all the way to Harriet, so gorge sure feels like it is in Vic.   I know that you don't actually hang the signs yourself but wouldn't it be a lot easier to have a sign that tells you what the actual speed limit is rather than a sign that tells you what the speed limit used to be?  I know it's a bit of a rant but it would be super unfair to get a speeding ticket along a stretch of road that is deceptively marked like government may very well be. I know that those new signs have to be paid for somehow and that Vic PD are eventually going to start handing out tickets enforcing the new speed limits but, like I said, the area isn't clearly marked in such a way that a reasonable person would be able to determine what the limit actually is."
VictoriaBC,38u96b,Couchtiger23,2,Sun Jun 7 05:44:58 2015 UTC,"I just drive whatever speed I feel is safe...so I don't pay much attention to all the shiny new signage...but in BC municipalities it's 50 unless otherwise posted. Victoria tried to convince the whole province to change it to 40, but everyone else quickly told them to take a hike, that's why the city had to spend all that money putting up the 40 signs."
VictoriaBC,38u96b,chinbeardsareover,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"This doesn't answer the question at all. The new bylaw is ""40 unless otherwise indicated"". The sign says ""end 40 zone"" but there is no signeage saying what the new speed limit is. Does this mean that the speed limit is  still 40 because the limit isn't ""otherwise indicated""   Anyways, a sign that tells you what the speed limit used to be bit doesn't tell you what it actually is isn't helpful at all and it seems as though /u/VicPDCanada doesn't know either (the question might sound complicated but the answer is a simple ""40/50 kph"")   I think the new speed limit is a good idea but it's only within the nebulous borders of Victoria. Does everybody know exactly where the borders are?  How is this new bylaw going to hold up when the police start handing out tickets for going 50 in a 40 zone right down the block from a sign that says ""end 40 zone""?   You can drive whatever speed you feel safe at if you like but I prefer to live in a society where people are allowed to know when they are breaking the law."
VictoriaBC,38u96b,Couchtiger23,4,Sun Jun 7 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"It answers the question perfectly. There is no ""40 unless otherwise indicated"" bylaw that I am aware of, its ""50 unless otherwise posted"" in all of BC. The City's bylaw was to change selected streets to 40. To change all streets to 40 requires province wide ratification and the other municipalities in this province think Victoria is absolutely out to lunch on this issue (as do I). The answer to your question is 50. In fact it's 50 in all of Canada as far as I'm aware. If there is no limit posted, you can go 50 in an urban area. Your speedometer isn't that accurate anyway, so it's almost a moot point to try to distinguish between 40 and 50 anyway.  City of Victoria link"
VictoriaBC,38u96b,chinbeardsareover,2,Sun Jun 7 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, it's helpful. I guess I was misinformed about the new bylaw. I still think that signs that tell you what the speed limit is make more sense than signs that tell you what it used to be."

Someone else pointed out that Vic is still 50 unless otherwise indicated. My point that a sign that tells you what the speed limit is makes more sense than a sign that tells you what the speed limit was still stands.   Thamks for the reply, even though you didn't actually answer the question at all. I pointed out that there is an area where the speed limit isn't posted and you replied ""if the posted sign says...""  I'm not sure if you misunderstood my question or are being sarcastic so, as an act of good faith, why don't you tell me what the speed limit in the unmarked area on Government between Chatham and Gorge is?"
VictoriaBC,38u96b,Couchtiger23,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"No sarcastic intent here at all.  In the link that /u/chinbeardsareover posted there's a PDF of the speed limits as proposed by the City of Victoria. Government, between Chatham and Gorge falls in two zones of 40km/hr. The first is the Downtown Core boundary, where all speed limits are 40km/hr under the new plan. The second are individual stretches which include Gorge Road from Hillside all the way to Harriet St, which is also a 40 km/hr zone. The area you've asked for definition in contains both those zones.   Here's a link directly to the PDF from the City of Victoria: http://www.victoria.ca/assets/Departments/Engineering~Public~Works/Documents/ProposedSpeedLimits.pdf I found it helpful in sorting out where each area is.  If you think there's missing or unclear signage, best to give the City of Victoria Public Works a call: 250.361.0400  Disclaimer: /u/osoko here. Our regular redditor Cst. Mike Russell is away.

But then it's 50 again once you turn left onto any of the cross streets -- unless you're turning left onto Quadra, or making your way to Quadra, then it's still 40.   Got it? No? Me either. I guess we'll just have to keep our eyes off the road and on our speedometers/looking for road signs because the speed limit changes every forty seconds."

VictoriaBC,38u96b,pfk505,17,Sat Jun 6 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"It's because the stats are massively misleading, due to the unique nature of metro Victoria being divided into 13 municipalities. What happens is that people from Langford, Saanich, Esquimalt, etc... commit some crime within the City of Victoria, and it unnaturally drives up the per-capita crime rate within the City of Victoria, because the City of Victoria is only 80,000 people out of a metro population of 360,000 people.    So when someone from Colwood gets in a bar fight downtown, in the City of Victoria, it goes on the record as a violent crime happened in the City of Victoria (population 80,000 people), even though the people might not even be from the City of Victoria.  If the Victoria area amalgamated all the 13 municipalities into one, the per capita stats on things like this would suddenly be a lot lower.    TL;DR - Victoria is not actually dangerous like stats would make it appear, but the quirky political lines of the region result in misleading ideas like this."

VictoriaBC,38u96b,stevo911_,0,Mon Jun 8 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"As stated by others in the thread, the methodology of this report is most certainly dodgy because they are looking at crime in the official city of Victoria only as opposed to Victoria metro region. With that said, Victoria is indeed more dangerous than many locals would like to believe (or at least tell others). I remember there were people on here last year saying how Victoria is safer than literally any place in Ontario and as someone who has spent the majority of their life in the Toronto metro region, I found that comment extremely laughable. Yes, it is undeniable that Victoria has a low homicide rate but that is not the only form of crime/danger. In my three years here, I have had at least a couple of occasions where aggressive (drunk or high) homeless individuals have tried to start a fight with me. There are more potentially violent panhandlers here than what I recall encountering anywhere in Ontario. I sometimes see people here suggesting to out-of-towners that the city is perfectly safe to walk for women at any time of day or night, at any location, which I truly find misleading. Just last week, a female work-colleague of mine was sexually harassed at a parking lot downtown in the middle of the day. I have heard similar stories from tons of other girls here, yet most people still continue to parrot that Victoria is somehow the safest city in the country. I truly wonder what most locals here think the crime situation is like in the rest of Canada. I imagine they think that Toronto is like Baghdad and Mogadishu rolled into one."

VictoriaBC,38rksr,Couchtiger23,2,Sun Jun 7 05:15:26 2015 UTC,Thats why theres a parking lot at that level.

VictoriaBC,38rksr,Chronic8888,2,Sat Jun 6 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"Meh, it's not that I can't afford to shop elsewhere. I just generally choose not to shop elsewhere, because I don't feel it's up to me to try and prop up local businesses that aren't as efficient.   If you're selling staple goods, then really, price is the primary factor that will determine whether or not I purchase something from you. A 2L bottle of Pepsi is the same whether or not I get it for $1.75 at Wal-Mart or $2.75 at Thifty's, or however much some Ma and Pa convenience store might sell it for.   Other than that, the primary market for local businesses should be niche markets that Wal-Mart doesn't cater to."

VictoriaBC,38rksr,Palpz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:24 2015 UTC,Walmart has pro's and con's.  The produce generally seems a bit worst then thrifties for marginally cheaper.  If you're buying soda and chips then it's fine.  The lines and parking are what kill it for me for day to day shopping.  Prices are almost identical at save on foods for a much better shopping experience.

I think the trick there is to hit up a craft fair (which im sure there will be many) and ask someone at the stall. Most people, especially in vic, would love to tell you about their hobbies. For trails, depends on what you are looking for. I think everyone in victoria absolutely loves mt. Doug/pkols trails. Goldstream is absolutely lovely. Theres a nice little lap beside the cedar hill rec center. Im a  big fan of the beach walk - particularly arbutus cove. If you are willing to go for a bit of a drive or do some overnight hikes - renfrew,  china beach, and sombrio beach ( also some of the most pretty places on the south island).

Even the way you replied though, shows my point and the op point.  It's unwelcoming to take someone who is interested in appreciating your city and just boil them down to ""assume they didn't search,  act snarky"""
VictoriaBC,38rksr,wildweeds,-1,Sat Jun 6 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"That's the funny thing about text versus spoken word; the emphasis on 'snarky' is in the mind of the beholder.  I can absolutely take the exact phrase I used and speak it without the slightest hint of snark or sarcasm, which was actually the way it was typed.    Makerspace has been mentioned many times, in many threads, as have a few of the other maker spaces.  There's a lot of discussion about hidden gems for hiking, from the trestle to the old water main, to all of the parks along the coast and up to Nomindo.  The burners are also present and have been discussed here.  In fact, all of your questions are answered on the sub somewhere or rather, but so many people just want to have the answers to their questions aggregated every few months.  The mod team has endeavored to make this information accessable and available through searches and even through aggregation via the 'best of vic' section of the site.  Yet we are frequently vilified, insulted, and have even been stalked, doxxed, and threatened by users.  Several mods have simply quit to keep their family safe.  Our policy is generally 'hands off', and we rarely get involved until there are numerous reports for a user or a post.  We have no shortage of people interested in appreciating our city; we do live in the best place in the world.  I was simply suggesting you try the search function to find some of the answers to your questions if you hadn't already.  I'm sorry that you've taken it as a snarky response, but it was not meant to be offensive."
VictoriaBC,38rksr,witty_remark,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly when moving here I found this sub incredibly unhelpful.   Reading through posts from years ago about neighborhoods, restaurants, etc isn't exactly helpful, and when I posted with specific questions I was either downvoted or my post was deleted.   Maybe a FAQ in the sidebar would be helpful, or expanding the information that is in the sidebar so that some frequently asked questions are listed there.   For example ""Where should I move"" could warrant it's own FAQ section. It wouldn't completely stop the monthly posts on the subject, but at least directing those people to it would be a bit more helpful than directing them to the search."

Like was already stated, most popular online businesses have free shipping in lower 48 states.  Seawings shipping rates are extremely reasonable, customer service is excellent.  To get everything setup, give them a call and set up an ""account"", really just giving them your contact info so when the item arrives at the Blaine depot they can have it properly directed. Item is shipped to YYJ, you get a phone call, go to Seawings warehouse right next to the main terminal, get the customs document from one of the staff, take that with the receipt for what ever you bought to the customs office in the terminal, pay your duties/taxes, bring the stamped document back to Seawings, pay their shipping fees (Minimum cost is around $18 up to a certain weight, then goes up by a few cents per pound.), and receive your package, then walk away smiling because you didn't get bent over by UPS/Fedex."

Have the item shipped to their address in Blaine with your name on it. When it shows up, they call you. You go into their office (which is on the airport property) and they give you a slip of paper which you then have to go and declare yourself at customs. Once you've sorted out the customs clearance you get a slip to bring back to Seawings and then you leave with your stuff (after paying their fee). I don't recall them having any option to handle the customs for you, otherwise they'd just be doing what any UPS or Fedex does. You will still have to pay duty as applicable on the item, but you can often save because of buying in USD and often much cheaper (or free) shipping to US addresses. The seawings price was pretty cheap. I think it was like $10 or $15 for my parcel."

I've used them probably 20 or 30 times and they're fantastic, exactly how a business should be run.  u/irocudont sums it up perfectly, if you don't live near the airport just make sure you call seawings before make the drive out to make sure the customs office is going to be open when you get there.  The officers from the customs office all leave when the anacortes ferry comes in (to go process people at the ferry terminal) and you can't process your stuff without the office open."

Battery warrantee via the manufacturer is generally one year; check the fine print in the Future Shop warranty and/or your credit card plan if you used one as you might have extra coverage.
VictoriaBC,38k16y,RalphHinkley,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"It's roughly 2 years old. It doesn't get a ton of heavy usage, but I have tended to keep it plugged in (though usually take it out once fully charged).   I'll take a look and see about warranty/credit card plan."
VictoriaBC,38k16y,RalphHinkley,4,Thu Jun 4 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Used to do IT consulting for a living and I've seen it many times where a company will get 5-10 laptops, all the same brand/model, and almost all the users refuse to plug them in until the batteries are dead.   If you consult on this the feedback you'll get is, ""This is a laptop, the business paid extra for the total freedom from cords, why would I plug it in?""..  Fast forward 8-12 months and you'll always see the same thing. The users who refuse to plug in, even when there's an outlet nearby/no need to move, need new batteries. The users who have always stayed plugged into power have over 85% original runtime on their batteries and barely notice any wear/aging.  Don't get me wrong, not all laptops have the same batteries and some need discharging, but in most cases you should always try to be on AC power."

He takes a single example of an adjunct professor being let go and extrapolates that to denouncing the entire ""social justice"" movement (which he barely even tries to define).  My experience was that professors were willing to listen to experience of students but were also capable of correcting wrong ideas. I was on the exec of the political science course union and in my 4 years we never received a single complaint about professors ""hurting someone's feelings"".   Furthermore, the article actually makes some good points in identifying that universities have begun treating students like customers, but then goes off the rails and starts blaming social justice and whatnot. Ridiculous. I find much of what he writes hard to believe, and I studied in a very left wing department at a very left wing school."

I was an engineering major but I have a closet obsession with learning about philosophy and psychology, so I get into a lot of arguments about social issues.   I have many friends that behave like this. Some of the irrational, self centered bullshit I've heard, that rejects  scientific consensus, is sad. Especially because it's coming from university educated people who should know how to think critically.  If an argument is based on patriarchy theory, it is always right and never needs evidence to back it up. A white male's viewpoint, even when supported by evidence, is bias. A feminist viewpoint, supported by zero evidence, is not bias.  Feminist viewpoints are always benevolent, always fair and always right, even when they leverage and exploit processes that can be argued to be unethical (like coercion by the State).   In one argument, a group of friends took the position that focusing on wage gaps (for which we can't prove what % is due to discrimination) is a higher priority than preventing child abuse. I think preventing child abuse is also akin to preventing future murder and rape, because abused children are more likely to become violent rapists. You would think feminism would champion this cause, which may be the single most effective way to reduce rape. If only it got half the attention as the ""Ban Bossy"" campaign."

VictoriaBC,38gw7g,samuraipizzacat71,2,Thu Jun 4 19:02:31 2015 UTC,Thanks! Things have been good so far. We launched this as a weekend project back in March and it has taken off pretty quickly in the tech sector. We're currently concentrating on catering more to businesses (eg. we go to Costco every Monday to stock the kitchens of tech offices around town) but we're still doing the on-demand stuff as well. Right now it's completely text based but we will be coming out with a website/app in the future for browsing and purchases. Something similar to Postmates in the US but with a few key differences.
VictoriaBC,38gw7g,manifest23,3,Thu Jun 4 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"I've had great experiences so far. In one case they drove all the way out to langford to find the right office chair for me. I would have spent 2-3 hours researching/driving etc.. I haven't used for food yet, so I can't really comment on that front. However, one thing that has been holding me back from trying it for some take-out is that it always seems quicker to just walk 6 blocks down the road and pick something up myself. For larger services in big cities where they have staff constantly ready and waiting in the busy areas it's a different case. Victoria is a little slower going than those areas. Perhaps /u/manifest23 has some insight into how they are approaching those scenarios."
VictoriaBC,38gw7g,andyjbas,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"Our food delivery times are currently around 45 minutes on average. I think we could probably get this number down, but for the most part it's due to us waiting on the restaurant and not our commute. This obviously changes during times with heavy traffic, but that is to be expected.  Our most popular restaurants are actually Part and Parcel and Relish. These two places have some of the best food in the city, but unfortunately they're a bit too far out of the downtown core for a lot of companies to get to for lunch. Walking a few blocks to grab some food is always going to be better than ordering delivery, but sometimes you're either too busy to leave, or just feeling incredibly lazy. We are also especially useful for people who live a 10-15 minutes drive outside of the city but really like the food options that are available to them downtown.  I don't think we're ever going to make a living just doing on-demand food delivery to people in Victoria. That's why we're currently concentrating on catering more to businesses and trying to get our average order cost up. To help accomplish this we are starting to go to Costco every Monday to stock the kitchens for local (mostly tech) offices. This will also be available to individuals who want to buy from Costco but don't want to go to Langford, don't have a Costco membership, and/or don't have a vehicle."

They are both huge chains of middle class dinning, which gives them the capability to throw money into building a proper kitchen, which in turn allows them to have things like warming drawers where something like rice or mash potatoes are kept. (at the proper temperature). The only things i ever saw microwaved were some appetizers to melt cheese onto it and warm it up. Example the spinach dip at Milestones (which is freaking awesome and made in house) or desserts because it's pretty much impossible to keep them warm without drying them out.

VictoriaBC,38f8pj,ILoveBabyBats,3,Thu Jun 4 11:22:46 2015 UTC,"My restaurant years taught me that specials are almost always...   Someone in the kitchen testing out a new dish or otherwise experimenting. Perishables that won't last another day getting used up.   I kind of like going to late night eateries for that midnight ambiance and people-watching. This is my excuse for being at Denny's a couple of weeks ago and being told by one of the wait staff, ""Don't order the country-fried steak, it's not even real meat."" This, of course, just made me curious."

I took his photo for that comment so I could prove who it was. I was later warned by a busker that watched the whole thing to be careful of that guy he was nuts.  I understand that the bylaw guys have to deal with lots of crap but the police, bylaw and so on are starting to look like a private army and not looking very welcoming. Not that they are not but they don't seem approachable. Victoria has a lot of problems with crime and that street population (IV drug users, drug dealers etc.) So I sort of get the need for the vests."

Americans that dont live in Seattle or near it have no idea about Victoria or Vancouver Island it seems.

Side note: Apparently I have an accent. People notice immediately and think at first I am from Minniapolis or something. I didnt think Victorians had much of a Canadian accent but I guess we do."

VictoriaBC,38do0l,Sasken,6,Wed Jun 3 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"Thats funny, she probably thought Columbia. It is crazy how little the amerage American knows about Canada that is not from a South Park episode.   Likewise, those who have been to Canada, especially the praries, have nothing but great things to say about Canadians. They really seem impressed with Canadian hospitality and general kindness.  Have been told several stories of Americans stranded in the praries with a broken down car asking locals for help, end up staying the night with a Canadian family who feeds them, clothe them, and sends them on their way with snacks on top of helping out the car situation."

He was ranting (mildly) about all the ""foreigners"" at the Grand Canyon. My wife and I finally had to say ""we're Canadian"". He was taken aback for a second then said ""well that doesn't count"".  I don't understand some things about Americans (the over-the-top patriotism especially) but as individuals they are generally really good people.

I'm leaning towards the RAP parking lot as well, with the police station nearby being a good case for it. Also it's a flat, open, vacant area that can be well maintained. Dignity Village in Portland is a good example of a village of a similar fashion that works.   Other than Topaz park, the other two parks are too secluded. People would also be less inclined to use the parks if they were chosen. While Topaz park is more open, there's still a large fence that would make the inhabitants feel enclosed.

There seems to be no middle ground, either good guy cyclist or scumbag steve.   the things that grate on me the most are basic safety stuff   don't pass on the right (in the curb) don't run stop signs and signals don't unnecessarily hold up traffic (the same rules about pulling over to let traffic by also apply to bicycles) do wear you helmet, seriously. do use lights (just say no to ninjacycling) do ride single file   that all being said i also strongly support separate infrastructure for different modes of transport. We don't try sending cars down train tracks for the same reason running bikes on motor vehicle streets is not a great idea either..  edit: also..  Motor Vehicle drivers, don't be a douche..   give cycles as much room as possible when passing  check right mirror twice when turning/changing lanes (three times if there is a bike lane to the right). Its amazing how easily bikes disappear into the background clutter. This is also the reason it grates me when cyclists pass on the right. I give them room when passing, i expect the same from them and not creep up my blind spot in the 6"" between the vehicle and curb."
VictoriaBC,38edfl,sorss,7,Wed Jun 3 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"Good guidelines, to elaborate, here are some tips for motorists driving around cyclists.  -Pass at least 1 meter from cyclist (now law in Ontario)  -Remember to shoulder check as a general rule and especially when bike lane present on right.  -Make eye contact with cyclists whenever possible  -Signal well in advance before crossing bike lane.  -When entering and exiting parked car parallel to bike lane, shoulder check before opening door or pulling car out of parked spot.   -If a cyclist is riding in the middle of a lane on a narrow street, it is because they are practicing good safety. This is legal in B.C., please pass them safely and don't get angry.   If there is no shoulder or bike lane and the curb lane is narrow (i.e. when the right wheel track of most traffic is less than a metre from the curb), cyclists may choose to take the whole lane by riding in the centre of it. This can be safer than riding near the curb, which may encourage motorists to squeeze by where there isn’t sufficient room. You should also consider taking the lane when you are travelling at the same speed as other traffic. This will keep you out of motorists’ blind spots and reduce conflicts with right-turning traffic. Be prepared for the occasional frustrated driver who is not familiar with the safe and legal operation of a bicycle.   -STOP AT ALL STOP SIGNS WHICH INTERSECT WITH LOCHSIDE TRAIL.

If they wait at the end of a line of 20 cars at a red light until it turns green, it'll turn red again before they get up to it. It annoys me too when I drive, but I can understand it.   And I also understand not coming to a full stop, by getting off the seat and putting a foot down, at a stop sign when there are no cars or pedestrians around. They're going like 10k.

(2) Despite subsection (1), a driver of a vehicle must not cause the vehicle to overtake and pass another vehicle on the right  (a) when the movement cannot be made safely, or  (b) by driving the vehicle off the roadway.  i think there is also one about 2 vehicles 1 lane but I can't locate it ATM so i might be mistaken."
VictoriaBC,38edfl,CaptainGo,6,Wed Jun 3 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"Actually it is a bit of a grey area legally and is up to interpretation. It's vague only in an officer to officer sense that they can ticket you if they want to.   Passing on the right: Passing vehicles on the right between intersections, especially in congested city traffic, is a topic of debate, even in the courts. Under appropriate circumstances, case law suggests that cyclists should be able to legally pass slower moving traffic on the right where the curb lane is wide, provided they are cautious. Most often it is best to shoulder check, move into the middle of the lane and line up with the rest of traffic. This will also prevent motorists from making a right turn into you as you enter an intersection. When cycling in narrow-lane traffic where many motorists attempt to squeeze past you before each traffic light, some cycling instructors suggest the following: Rather than moving up to the first car, which will likely re-pass the cyclist, it may be more strategic for the cyclist to proceed   It is legal to pass on the right:  • when you are in a bike lane; or  • when the vehicle is turning left or indicating a left turn.  When NOT to pass on the right:  • when traffic is moving;  • when there is a street, driveway or parking spot a car can turn into; or  • when there is less than 1.5 m between traffic and the curb."
VictoriaBC,38edfl,Shawn68z,2,Wed Jun 3 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"The rule that I follow when I'm on a bike and beside traffic on the right:   Act as if every car is going to veer right without signalling at the worst possible time. If it is physically impossible for such a car to hit me (because it is boxed in by other cars and couldn't move right even if it wanted to), it is safe to pass on the right. If traffic starts moving while I'm to the right of it, choose the right rear corner/bumper of the next car in a position to hit me if it swerved right. Pull up just behind this bumper, and follow it as the car moves, braced to stop if that car does move right. That way, no other cars are in a position to cause problems by moving right (because the car I'm following would be in their way), and I'm watching the only car that could cause a problem."

Slower moving traffic, but traffic that has already passed them is not slower moving is it?  my main reason for disliking this method of passing comes from several close calls. I occasionally drive a transport truck. That thing is one big blind spot on the right. You could hide a tank in there let alone a bicycle.

VictoriaBC,38edfl,Threpid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:39:11 2015 UTC,"By that logic, the defensive driving for motorcycles promoted by the province is pointless.     Defensive lane positioning prevents/deters vehicles from attempting to share the lane with you. It works.     I'm not saying cars and cyclists need to travel at the same speed.     I'm saying cyclists should occupy the full lane, and cars should use an adjacent lane to go around them.     This obviously wouldn't work if there were only one lane going in the intended direction; it would require two.    It is not a far cry from the current system. It just allows vehicles to use the lanes when cyclists aren't in them.     Slowing traffic down just creates more frustration and more smog, while hampering mobility."

Reception is pretty good in town and decent up-island as well.  A nice bonus is their ""member deals"" on their website.

VictoriaBC,38a6os,bangin_corners,19,Wed Jun 3 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"Criminals love prohibition, they thrive on it. The bootleggers in BC made a fortune smuggling liquor into the states back in the day. Now that liquor is legal in the states, you never hear about ciminals dealing in alcohol, unless they rob a liquor store. The bootleggers were cut off from the knees, and their revenue dried up.   Alcohol is legal, and more people die from that than any other additive substance other than cigarettes.  All drugs are a health issue, and need to be treated that way.  Cops bust users, and dealers, they don't care.  Plus..., busting non-violent drug users is safer than going after violent criminal gangs.  Not everyone who uses drugs are addicted to them, not everyone who drinks is a alcoholic. Legalize everything, control it, and sell it like alcohol, and cigerettes, tax the shit out of it, use those taxes for education, rehabilitation, and treatment. The modern day bootleggers (gangs/drugdealers) will lose their cash cow, and have to find something else to do. The jails would stop warehouseing non-violent drug users whose only crime is using, and instead have real options.   You want safety, consider this, drugs are not going away, ever. The war on drugs is a huge failure of epic proportions, and we are not any safer, and the users are not safer, and even the cops are less safe, which makes us less safe. The laws on drugs are based on moral reasons not health reasons, plus the drug companies prefer the status quo, as do the criminals (some of them are billionares, and have private armies because of the drug war), and private prisions (which may open in Canada), and many politicians, and police (because of bugets). All really good reasons to consider rethinking how we approach this issue."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,DoubleExposure,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:51:52 2015 UTC,"I think your argument is relevant to relatively harmless drugs like marijuana and maybe cocaine but sounds a bit ridiculous when it comes to things like methamphetamine or heroin. It sounds like you are saying that there are no health risks associated with drugs. And the police do not see larger budgets because of this. In this incident, all costs came out of current police budgets. With drug trafficking comes all sorts of other issues like sexual assault, theft, violence, etc."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,Surfthecoast,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are saying that there are no health risks associated with drugs.   Then I did not make it clear enough for you. I do think drugs can have serious health risks. I have seen it with my own eyes, 3 of my friends (that I know of) were/are heroin addicts. I have known more alochoics, yet if a drug user is caught with drugs, off to jail they go, while a alochoic can go about their business. Alcohol destroys more lives than heroin, yet it is legal with restrictions, taxed, and it is treated as a health problem.   police do not see larger budgets   I did not say that, that is not how bugets work, if crime drops, and arrests drop so do police bugets, so they have to make quotas, like with traffic violations. The police always deny that quotas are in place, but everyone knows that they have to keep the numbers up to show that they are being effective, and quotas are the only way of doing that. Busting non-violet users is a low risk way of keeping the numbers up, and maintaining their buget."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,DoubleExposure,2,Thu Jun 4 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"I am a police officer and we do not have quotas per se. We do have stats. Like you said, they are easy ways to show we are being effective because you better believe the public would not be too happy if we weren't doing anything. Firefighters and paramedics keep stats as well. But our stats can be anywhere from school visits, traffic warnings, curfew checks, patrols on reserves, etc. And that is in the extremely small amount of ""free"" time we have because 95% of our time is taken up by responding to calls for service and paperwork. We don't bust non-violent users because it is low risk. It is because they are doing something else illegal like stealing, assault, or driving while impaired.   We are not like the states where simple drug possession send you to jail for years. They may get a fine or probation term. If you want to check for yourself, check out the names in the article on court services online. See what their past history is and sentences for previous convictions.  You've seen how drugs destroy lives. Sometimes people don't want treatment or have the willpower to help themselves. Once in a while going through the court system including support from a probation officer or the threat of jail helps. There are also some drug courts in BC, which I think are pretty effective because they deal with the health, socio-economical, and criminal aspects of someone's behaviour."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,Surfthecoast,-1,Fri Jun 5 04:37:16 2015 UTC,should we make all drugs legal?
VictoriaBC,38a6os,TechnicallyITsCoffee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think we should, the positives outweigh the negitives. The money would flow in the direction of taxable goods that can be used for health care, education, and treatment, instead of going to criminal gangs, the over burdened court system, and over-flowing prisons. There would be less drug related deaths from ODs, bad drugs, and from drug bust gone bad."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,DoubleExposure,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"I would be okay with legalizing I suppose.  I think it would have to be very closely monitored, even more so then liquor.    I would think all ""sale locations"" should have to be approved by the local community.  Likely need to have some financial incentives because who wants to live beside a place that sells Chrystal meth.  I think non licensed sellers should continue to be prosecuted  I think it should be fully privatised so anywhere selling is Provincially or federally owned.  We would have to work with the USA first as this policy may hurt our foreign reputation.  Ultimately I am still hesitant I feel some drugs just shouldn't be sold / consumed."

VictoriaBC,38a6os,fruitybubbles11,6,Wed Jun 3 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The government should have built rehab centers (maybe even involuntary ones), increased funding for mental health and addictions services, built more social housing, and launched education programs instead of just building more prisons. Nothing good comes out of prisons.  It costs more to deal with this stuff through the criminal justice system than through the medical system. Think of all the police salaries, and court costs, and incarceration expenses. I think that the mounties might want to focus on harm reduction rather than risking their lives going after gangsters, but of course politicians have to look tough for the papers.  I'm in favour of stuff like safe injection sites and methadone clinics.  If you reduce supply by making a commodity illegal without reducing demand you're only creating a black market. The more the police clamp down on drugs, the more they'll be worth to dealers and users, and the more problems they'll cause.  I hate drugs. I don't do them. They're poison, and anyone who uses them is doing something stupid. But I think drugs should be legalized, and only sold by the government. It'd take away the entire market sector from organized crime, and would be a huge blow to them. The government could restrict the conditions of use so that they're relatively medically safe, like it's legal to use drugs but only under medical supervision in a clinical environment, maybe even under restraint depending on the seriousness of the effects, and offer info and rehab treatment to anyone who comes in to use them.  Anyway, those are just my half-baked opinions on the topic. I haven't kept up with how legalization has gone in Europe."
VictoriaBC,38a6os,Hoblok,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:20:41 2015 UTC,"So what should police do when they get complaints of a drug dealer in a neighbourhood? The downstairs neighbour of one of the houses said on Facebook that she has lived with this for over a year. Constant traffic, noise, violence, and someone even broke down her door. Neighbours were having their belongings stolen. People are driving to and from these locations impaired and with no licences. Police can either spend a ridiculous amount of resources dealing with all these fringe crimes or go to the source.   I totally agree that this is a health and education issue but there will always be drug dealers that prey on the vulnerable of society and we need to protect them the best way we can."

VictoriaBC,3893m7,Holypapalsmear,2,Tue Jun 2 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"I have had it for a month or so.  Zero problems and almost half the price, one just can't complain one bit about that. I own my modem so even including the switch cost, the first month was still cheaper than a month with Shaw."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,RalphHinkley,2,Wed Jun 3 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"Woo.. very nice. Looks like the 25/2.5 users are already getting 30/2.5+!   It's not as 'hiccup' prone as the shaw connection was either, very solid speeds!"
VictoriaBC,3893m7,RalphHinkley,4,Fri Jun 5 06:02:12 2015 UTC,"As the top comment you should edit it to add some points.   The current rates are going up at Juce too thanks to a recent CRTC decision and a pending decision could even end them entirely. Juce is a 2 month pre-pay. You pre-pay the month you're currently using and you've also always got a month pre-paid on top. Strange but confirmed. The initial fees can add up if you don't own your Shaw modem and you don't own a WiFi router and need one. A modem from Juce will run between $20 - $59 *(including $10 shipping)+tax. If you're currently on a Shaw 'free lease' modem like the Motorola SB5102 (very common) you should know that during peak periods you will be sharing channels. The top two modems that Juce sells ($45/$59 w/shipping) have lots more channels allowing you to avoid congestion regardless of Shaw vs. Juce. (It's not a bad investment.) Do you really want a Shaw WiFi router with the Shaw Go WiFi enabled or do you want one with multiple antennas all devoted to your devices to avoid dropouts?  Does the Shaw WiFi have USB3.0/eSata ports to add hard drives/act as a media server? So really the free WiFi is priced well. Juce does not offer Cable 60 because Shaw's charging too much for last-mile service. Juce runs its own connectivity right up to the last mile/Shaw's main junctions, but Shaw wants over %80 of the subscription fees just to provide that last mile service."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,Fiduciary_One,3,Wed Jun 3 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"""Current rates"" being those that new customers pay.  Current customers have been told they will be grandfathered.  Of course if the company folds that's a risk, but I'm ok with the risk given how much I'm saving over Shaw."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,RalphHinkley,3,Wed Jun 3 05:43:27 2015 UTC,"Well that's it in a nutshell. If you play events out it could go like this:   CRTC rules that the 127% fee increase is acceptable JUCE raises rates for new signups After some time passes JUCE signups aren't sufficient to pay costs JUCE raises rates for new signups to nearly match Shaw After some time passes the inability to pay costs forces them to declare they have to shut down... ...Unless grandfathered users would be willing to pay full price vs. go to Shaw and pay full price for worse upstream performance?   So it could mean a voluntary rate increase if Shaw's allowed to hold all of us hostage for the changing demand for CableTV/PPV that Shaw failed to properly anticipate.  I am eager to add my voice to any petition that would clearly speak against the Shaw monopoly/desire to maintain high profits even with poor management/planning in terms of the waning TV business.  Unfortunately, even with multiple posts about the issue, there's nobody linking to an actual CRTC topic that's open for public comment. You can add yourself to a flakey 'general' petition that's trying to assert too wide a range of concerns but I see nothing for this singular issue."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,stevo911_,2,Thu Jun 4 02:13:07 2015 UTC,"^ this, even if Juce only lasts 6 months and folds I'm coming out ahead.  I'll save money in the meantime, and when(if) they fold, I can switch back to telus or shaw and get another intro package (When I signed up for shaw 8 months ago I had the first 6 months for 50% off. If Juce doesn't fold, and keeps me grandfathered, I still win.  The only way I don't come out ahead is if they don't honour what they say about grandfathering in the next few months, or go under before the end of the year.  I'm willing to gamble with that for the savings."

VictoriaBC,3893m7,knottysleeves,0,Thu Jun 4 19:43:54 2015 UTC,The startup costs are holding me back from switching. $22 transfer fee is fine (I'm already with Shaw so it would be an easy switch) but buying a cable modem AND a wireless router on top of that isn't going to save me any money in the long run.
VictoriaBC,3893m7,Trapick,4,Tue Jun 2 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you ignore the cheap intro rate and stupid bundling discounts, Shaw charges $67 for 25Mpbs (source: just checked my bill) compared to $40 at Juce. $27 a month pays for a very nice modem and router in under a year."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,knottysleeves,4,Tue Jun 2 22:31:16 2015 UTC,"But will Juce and other resellers still be around a year from now? Quote from an article written by the founder of Juce earlier this year:   Speaking from the perspective of a new start-up independent ISP (we plan to launch in March 2015), if [Shaw's new proposed] tariff gets approved as-is, we will be forced to shut down business. Simple as that.   Shaw/Telus are doing sneaky & shitty things to their last-mile resellers, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I'm hesitant to invest in buying all my own hardware when the Shaw/Telus reseller landscape is so uncertain right now."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,Trapick,3,Tue Jun 2 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a great point. Hopefully the CRTC won't cave to Shaw/Telus and the resellers can stay alive, but it's a really lousy situation. It's also annoying that going with Juce you still have to give money to Shaw - just slightly less, and indirectly. I wish we had real competition."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,stevo911_,2,Tue Jun 2 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"This, their modems are cheap (you can get a refurb one for like 10-15 bucks from Juce).  I already had a wireless router, but if you shop sales or get  a basic router, you'd break even in 3-4 months and then its all money in your pocket."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,ehManiacal,2,Tue Jun 2 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"Shaw doesn't offer 25mbps anymore, it's 30mbps now for $70 a month. Which is still ridiculous."

On top of this they have 3rd-world upload speeds and now they are increasing prices again. Fucking garbage. The owners of Shaw should be eliminated."
VictoriaBC,3893m7,Galurana,13,Tue Jun 2 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Over all, Shaw lost about 36,000 cable TV customers, 12,000 land-line telephone subscribers and 1,800 Internet customers in the quarter, figures that were all worse than analysts had predicted.  Sales at its consumer division, the company’s largest business unit, declined 0.5 per cent to $937-million while overall revenue was up 4.9 per cent to $1.34-billion.  Shaw said its profit for three months ended Feb. 28 was $168-million, down 24 per cent from a year earlier as a result of restructuring costs as well as a one-time gain recorded on the sale of two specialty channels in the second quarter of 2014.  Aww poor shaw they only made $168 million in profit instead of $221 million how ever will they survive"

We have not been given all of the details about how this increase is going to affect every package. From my understanding so far, the increase will be for $3 plus taxes"
VictoriaBC,3893m7,knottysleeves,6,Tue Jun 2 18:39:31 2015 UTC,Didn't they just effectively increase rates a few months ago when they changed the packages?! Now they do them again?
VictoriaBC,3893m7,Wraith978,4,Tue Jun 2 18:41:28 2015 UTC,They increased the old plan rates about 10% when they intoduced the new plans.

VictoriaBC,3893m7,monkey_monkey_monkey,5,Tue Jun 2 20:12:10 2015 UTC,Give shaw a call and ask to be put through to their customer retention department. Tell the rep you're planning on leaving and they should try to keep you. Last time I did this I was bumped to the intro rate for another 6 months. That ended this month so I think I'll be giving them another call soon.  If they don't offer you anything you can always still go through with it and switch to telus.

It says they use an 'incumbant carrier' to move data from their(Juce's) network to the 'end users'. So they must have some sort of agreement with Shaw/Telus. Would be nice to know a little more about what that entails.
VictoriaBC,3893m7,samuraipizzacat71,2,Tue Jun 2 22:43:30 2015 UTC,They're just a Shaw reseller.
VictoriaBC,3893m7,chinbeardsareover,7,Tue Jun 2 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Got any documentation on that? Be curious to see.  Like I said, they use the 'incumbant carrier' to move the data from their data network to the end user. So I'm sure Shaw/Telus get a hefty cut, it's not really the same as a 'Shaw reseller' though.  Regardless it's cheaper than Shaw (without the 6 month discount) so if you don't want to fight with Shaw every 6 months it may be an option.  Edit: I'm going to take that downvote from whoever to mean you don't really understand how ISPs work. Oh reddit."

VictoriaBC,3893m7,Drakia,3,Tue Jun 2 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"From their site, sounds like you might only have a month to sign up for that  *The incumbent cable carrier filed to CRTC to withdraw Cable 25 (25Mbps) plan to new customers on July 3rd, 2015. If approved, we will not be able to sell Cable 25 to new customers after July 3rd, 2015. Customers who subscribes to Cable 25 before July 3rd 2015 will be grandfathered and will keep $39.95/month price going forward and they will not be affected in anyway. In separate CRTC application, the incumbent cable carrier is seeking to set our cost for the new 30Mbps plan at 127% higher than existing 25Mbps plan. Therefore the new 30Mbps maybe priced much higher if this application is approved by CRTC. We recommend that customers wishing to purchase Cable 25 do so before July 3rd, 2015 to qualify for grandfathered status and pricing."

Sometimes it will be on the honour system (with envelopes and a box).   Management companies don't get the park fees that are paid, it is a flat contract (at least on the newest round on contracts that are being negotiated). There is only one park in the province that generates revenue for the province (in excess of what it costs to manage it).

But if you want to be able to reserve, for a large group of people, ""a day- use area on the beach with a covered, semi-enclosed picnic shelter, picnic tables, change building with flush toilets, an information shelter and a large parking area"", then this might be for you. If you need to find a place to park 25 cars, and grandma can't really hike very well, and you have infants that need change tables, and you want this all to happen at a reserved location where you don't have to bring any garbage out...well, perhaps that's not really a lot of money for an event.   But if you're not wanting to use that facility, just don't use it, and go find a spot on some logs and have a super day :)"
VictoriaBC,38492j,iwasntgoingtocomment,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"The real issue is that having a for profit company run a park is wrong on principle, and because the contracts are given out to the lowest bidder and/or BC Liberal supporters, the parks are horribly run.  On the other hand having a ""personal finance"" type blog complain abut user fees is funny.  The tax evasion and tax cuts the advocate, nevermind the destructive nonsense like TFSA's and harmful tax credits on everything is a big (not the only, but a big one) reason these fees exist in the first place."

They could be reversed overnight and I suspect the people could be found in a matter of months, lots of qualified people would come to work in the parks from abroad, some who used to are still around, even some who work from the private companies are qualified and could do good work if given the right resources, laws and enforcement powers.  I would not be shocked if it even cost less this way but it is too important to matter, people are prepared to fund it, they generally do what the TV tells them to, and if it did have to be sold to them, it does not strike me as a hard one to do.  What may end up happening is tourism companies getting sick of having to deal with failing infrastructure (poo mountains almost reaching the top of outhouses anyone) they get laws passed for the government to raise budgets and take over management."

Beach fires must be at least 10’ from logs and other flammable material and must fully extinguished by midnight.

I wouldn't, and didn't, buy a house without making the sale conditional on the property being thoroughly checked for buried and forgotten tanks, and the removal of said tanks being completed before you take ownership.

I don't know that I'd call it ""good"" though... open late, shitty WiFi connection, all sorts of colourful folks staying until the wee hours of the morning. You may get propositioned by hookers. You may feel obliged to give a really drunk student a lift home. You may even get food poisoning. And yet, for some reason, I loved that place when I was a student."
VictoriaBC,383zr2,MileZeroC,2,Mon Jun 1 20:47:49 2015 UTC,I second this. I used to do the same. I don't think it is open as late as used to be. Ps QV stands for Quan Valdez. the more you know  Edit: someone else said it stands for Quo Vadis. Now I really want to know

The best location, if you are a Uvic student or you have someone to let you in at night is Uvic.  The ECS is open 24/7 if you have a keycard.  You can basically study there as late/early as you want.  The downsides is you can't re-enter after a certain time and there are random bad cell phone reception areas.  You just can't sleep there or they'll kick you out.  If you don't have a techy connection, the Clearihue is a great alternative.  I've been kicked out before I was a Uvic student once because security randomly went around checking rooms after a few high school students vandalized the area after ""studying.""  Timmys is a great choice now because they have WiFi but they cleverly hid all the outlets so power is your greatest concern.  Most Timmys if not all are open 24/7.  An odd choice but I've seen it is Mcdonalds.  All the renovated Mcdonalds now have Wifi.  They probably have outlets that are exposed in there.  I've seen people study there.  If you want a change of scenery, Moka house at Cook Street Village is open really early till Midnight? on most nights.  They have absorbed Black Stilt by Hillside mall.  I believe that location closes pretty early and is patrolled by the nazi Robbins Parking  Shabu Shabu Tea House/Young Youngs (beside 1550's), has open wifi.  They are also open fairly late but their closing hours seem quite random.  Some nights it's 10:30 pm, other nights it's 11:30 pm or 1:00 am or 2:00 am.  Some people study there.  They'll basically leave you alone there.  They always have bad service to everyone including Asians so honestly don't be worried.  Starbucks has free wifi also but most locations close around 10 pm ~ 10:30 pm."
VictoriaBC,383zr2,capslox,2,Wed Jun 3 00:53:15 2015 UTC,UVIC Library is open till 9pm.  I always preferred quiet to a café setting.

Personally, I don't believe we need GMOs in a place where we are able to produce the food we need to survive with responsible farming practices, but in areas where the environment won't support it, GMO is the obvious solution.  Shutting down GMO development and use is unfair and only causes more suffering, starvation, disease, violence, and dependence on aid.     There's also the overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and benefits of GMO crops, but scientific evidence is never convincing for those who make decisions based on emotional triggers.  There is more evidence that GMO crops are safe than there is that cigarettes cause cancer.  Honestly, I thought this was another post about the sewage treatment plant =)"

VictoriaBC,37zfyb,RumSeer,-2,Mon Jun 1 01:36:17 2015 UTC,Food production is not the issue with the starving masses.  It is getting food from the farm to the market to the starving person in a place where people have to walk to transport food.

Quite honestly, demanding labels for crops derived from biotechnology makes about as much scientific sense as demanding labels for crops based on the religious identity of their farmer. Anti-GMO is essentially a religion, your analogy is apt.  I just wish that the leader, a supposed ""lawyer"", was more willing to listen to both sides of the argument."

You are reaching out to the small group of people who are already set on their agenda and as you have shown, lobbying within their own space is somewhat futile when they can remove your posts with impunity. If you feel their their lobbying for policy is a threat, then lobbying similarly with the contrary argument seems to be the path toward reason rather than trying to sway the minds of people who don't really value analytical thought.

Your anger for Christianity is misguided, and your comparison between ALL Christians and the person OP is upset with is not accurate in any way.

VictoriaBC,37zfyb,SallySky,3,Mon Jun 1 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"Hahah that is a common argument from people who follow religion selectively. Having been brought up in the roman catholic church, I'm not exactly a complete outsider who has based all of his views toward religion on hearsay. I've been there, done that, and learned better. Christianity only stands side by side with science if you choose to disregard a great deal of what is actually part of the belief system. I don't buy into the ploy of brushing aside the obvious bullshit as ""interpretive"" or ""it's about the message"" just to try to cherry pick the good parts. We can bee good to each other without a boogeyman scaring us into it.  I'm obviously not here to debate religion with you, especially after I've made it quite clear that I tend to find debating with those who believe is a waste of time.

People go to church to have their beliefs validated, not questioned. Same with anti-anything rallies; most people already have firmly-held convictions and go to a rally for support and validation, not to have ""the other side"" show up and tell them they're idiots.

That's almost certainly a False Black Widow (aka Steatoda). We ran across several in a wood pile earlier this year. They can sometimes have a slight reddish tint to them in full light.    If it were an actual Black Widow, it would have the distinctive ""red hourglass"" on its back. How's that for ominous markings?"
VictoriaBC,37sjtl,Shivnasty,19,Sat May 30 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards true black widow based on the thinness of the last segment of the legs. And, as pointed out, hourglass is on abdomen, not back of latrodectus.  Had them all the time in Kamloops. I love spiders, but with small kids around the house, I couldn't take chances and covered the stairwell (external) with a thick coat of raid. I still watched one climb up the edge of my daughter's hood one day when she put her jacket on. You want to see dad reflexes, a black widow 1.5 cm from a 2 year old's face will cause them to kick in."

The female's body is 14–16 mm (1/2 in) in length and is black, often with an hourglass-shaped red mark on the lower abdomen. This ""hourglass"" mark can be yellow, and on rare occasions, white. The male of the species is around half this length and generally a tan color with lighter striping on the abdomen. The population was previously described as a subspecies of Latrodectus mactans and it is closely related to the northern species Latrodectus variolus. The species, as with others of the genus, build irregular or ""messy"" webs: Unlike the spiral webs or the tunnel-shaped webs of other spiders, the strands of a Latrodectus web have no apparent organization. Female black widows have potent venom composed of neurotoxins. Fatalities usually only happen with children and the elderly, however medical treatment may be required for others as well. However, the male black widow is harmless to humans.

Mac Demarco opened and absolutely killed it, but then we had to wait about 45 minutes before JC got on stage. The band was fine, but JC was facing away from the audience and would crouch everytime he sang, which sounded closer to screaming, so most of the songs weren't even recognizable. It seemed like he was going for some Jim Morrison thing, or maybe it just wasn't a good night. I'd love to see the Strokes play someday, though I don't think I'd pay to see him again, let alone make the trip to Seattle for it."

""How did you get downtown?"" ""Why do you need 20$, I can give you $2.50 to take the bus?""... Yeah, she couldn't answer any of these questions so I recognized the scam."

People aren't gullible. They're kindhearted and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  That said, never give money to anyone on the street.

VictoriaBC,37or6h,hyene,3,Fri May 29 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"Arguing that registered charities could be scammy in the context of a discussion about handing over cash to complete strangers on the street is a bit silly. At least a charity (to be properly registered) has to meet some requirements and maintain them. Sure, there are many cases of untoward dealings by charities and thus I am careful about which ones I will support, and am very selective.  If I was to consider any measure of involvement with any charity the first requirement is that the charity must be entirely secular and have no religious involvement whatsoever.  That is a floppy argument in this discussion, though.   How I feel about cyclists has nothing to do with the price of tea in china."

Is it against the law to ask someone for a handout and misrepresent why you need that handout? Is it against the law?  It is technically illegal to panhandle for money for any reason at all according to victoria bylaws, but you can plainly see that's not enforced, and that's not specifically what we're debating here. We're talking about this being a 'scam' and that the misrepresentation of the need for the money is somehow relevant to this being allowed or not (with which I disagree)."
VictoriaBC,37or6h,ALLCAPITALS,3,Fri May 29 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"Panhandling and scamming people for petty cash are two different things.  Yes, it is technically fraud to misrepresent yourself and take someone's money based on false information. But most people don't press charges against petty fraudsters over twenty bucks. I believe for theft under $5k it falls under summary offense with max 6 months jail time but I'm not so sure the same rules apply to fraud."

She tells you that the police couldn't help her with her stolen purse, and in my case, she really needed help getting to bear mountain to go to her daughter's home. She flashes her diamond ring and tells you that she's Jewish and she will pay you back in the mail. Even pulls out a pencil and paper to write down your address. I felt pretty bad because she looked legit, curse my big heart. She only asked for $20, too. I told her to not worry about paying me back. When I turned around after giving her the money, I saw her sprinting around the corner. Haha."

She was walking from Rockland area, told me she was just coming from VicPD (which wasn't in the direction she was coming from). Said she had to get to Bear Mountain for a conference. I said I didn't have money, and she pointed me in the direction of an ATM (in the opposite direction of where she had just come from, in a city she was 'visiting') - NO WAY she could have known where that ATM was if her story was true.  When I very politely said no, she scoffed so rudely at me ""so you're just not going to help me"" and trotted off. So I felt confident in my decision :-)  Like the police wouldn't bring this tourist who had her purse stolen back to her hotel? They'd just let her on the street with nothing and no way of getting somewhere safe?   This was about 2.5 years ago, so I guess this has been working for her for a while!

VictoriaBC,37q55v,BigC_13,1 point,Fri May 29 16:08:56 2015 UTC,That's standard contract law. If one party changes the terms of the contract the other party can say they don't consent to the change and void the contract.

VictoriaBC,37q55v,IslandHeyst,8,Fri May 29 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. Mistakes get made in contracts all the time. Sometimes it means someone gets a better deal than they bargained for, and someone gets the short end of the stick.  If this were a local business with ties to the community, I'd say play ball and agree to fix the error. However, this is Telus. If the situation were reversed, they'd hold you to the contract and laugh while doing it. Tell them to read their contracts more carefully next time."

If approved, we will not be able to sell Cable 25 to new customers after July 3rd, 2015. Customers who subscribes to Cable 25 before July 3rd 2015 will be grandfathered and will keep $39.95/month price going forward and they will not be affected in anyway. In separate CRTC application, the incumbent cable carrier is seeking to set our cost for the new 30Mbps plan at 127% higher than existing 25Mbps plan. Therefore the new 30Mbps maybe priced much higher if this application is approved by CRTC. We recommend that customers wishing to purchase Cable 25 do so before July 3rd, 2015 to qualify for grandfathered status and pricing."

VictoriaBC,37lh4c,nztraveller,1 point,Thu May 28 17:08:25 2015 UTC,Juce has cheap modems in stock.. The SB5101 (refurbished) is $10 + $10 delivery.  The most expensive is the 8x4 Channel Motorola SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 @ $49!   For most people though a DOCSIS 2.0 modem is just fine.. heck I almost went for the 4x4 channel Motorola SB6120 for $35 but then I thought about the $14 I was saving and the cost of a coffee at Starbucks and splurged on the extra channels.  (I actually dug up an old Terayon TCM200 modem I purchased from Shaw many moons ago and I bet nobody would even pay the shipping for it.)

I live in Black Creek (just north of Courtenay) and they gave me the greenlight for supporting my home.  I have a question about the Wifi Router part.. Does the modem connect to your router via ethernet like the Shaw one does or does it have to be via WIFI? Also am I able to use my router. I have a TP-Link WDR3600
VictoriaBC,37lh4c,ScubaJes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:57:56 2015 UTC,I've been using them for about about two months now and couldn't be happier. I had Shaw's student rate (25 mbps for $35.00) and when that expired it was going to nearly double in price.  I looked for alternatives (Telus) and that was going to cost me $62/month for 15 mbps.  I saw that Juce was new in town and decided to give them a shot.  I paid $10 for the modem and $22 for the transfer.  I now pay $39.95 for unthrottled 25 mbps.  I don't have any problems with hangups or disconnections so far and netflix is usually running and I am also a gamer.

Took 5 minutes to made an over-the-air antenna out of tinfoil and an icecream bucket lid and was able to pick up CityTV in HD.  I was paying about $120/month to Shaw for their broadband 25 plan ($67) plus $39.90 for ""Personal TV"".  New bill from Juce for Cable 25: $44.74."

VictoriaBC,37lh4c,diejetty,4,Fri May 29 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"This is far from accurate. They use shaw for the ""last mile"" but have their own servers, backbone connections and wan interface.  The CRTC is not all over juce, the CRTC is all over shaw/telus for trying to elbow small ISPs out of the market. Do some reading, educate yourself on what the CRTC has ordered shaw/telus/MTS/Rogers to do.  Wonder why telus raised its rates in February? It has everything to do with creating new price brackets that weren't approved by the CRTC's order to supply 25/50MBs at set rates.  Shaw/Telus got rid of their 100MB/s because they claim  ""people don't want high speed internet......""   If you believe that, keep supporting shaw and telus"

VictoriaBC,37luvl,Risiko19,6,Thu May 28 15:54:59 2015 UTC,Try Harbour Air.  I'm not 100% sure about the delivery process however if you get it on a plane early enough today it should be over there within hours.  Canada Post regular Expedited shipping is overnight to Vancouver if you get it in before 3 however they don't always make it overnight and will simply give you your money back if they don't.  I find it to be 70/30 odds in favor of overnight.
VictoriaBC,37luvl,sparcotsi,2,Thu May 28 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"Harbour Air will get the letter to Vancouver that day, so long as the planes aren't socked in with fog. You will need to arrange with another courier to deliver it from the seaplane terminal to its destination."

VictoriaBC,37mbe3,Sasken,4,Sat Jul 4 06:37:00 2015 UTC,"Rent-A-Wreck MIGHT (and I say ""might"" because there's no guarantee).  The big rental chains don't rent manuals because that limits their market: everybody can drive an automatic but not everybody can drive a manual. So why have a car on the lot that you might not be able to rent.  It's tough - I recently traded my car in on a new one and could only get an automatic. I think it's a really important skill to have and was hoping to teach my daughter on it when she was old enough. But now that looks unlikely.  I've always owned manual transmission cars. There are a few times when it was a pain (in long stop-and-go traffic jams) but most of the time it was better.

VictoriaBC,37mbe3,derekja,1 point,Fri May 29 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"Here's my story. We were trading our 2002 Nissan XTerra on a 2014. In order to get a manual transmission (in Canada anyway) you have to get the top of the line Pro-4X model. So that's what we did. We took the car home, and the next day the check engine light came on.  So we took it back, and they ""fixed"" the problem (a loose wire somewhere). Nope, light came back on. Long story short, they had the car almost a month while they worked on it (giving us a rental Silverado in the meantime).  Finally, they gave up and offered to buy the car back. They searched the entire country for a replacement 2014 with a manual transmission with no luck. Xterras are apparently only popular in the West, and it was near the end of the model year and there just were no manuals available. So we finally had to just accept an automatic instead (they absorbed the increase in price of course).  So you and I (and others like us) are apparently a dying breed. There just aren't that many manuals being sold anymore. And apparently the ones that are made are defective (kidding, sorta).  (When I took the car in for its first service a few months later I asked about the original car. They had to replace the entire engine; it was a factory defect of some kind)."

VictoriaBC,37gk4v,hankexfa,4,Wed May 27 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Uchida on Courtney is worth checking out. Only open from 11-2, the menu changes constantly.  Check out fisherman's wharf in James Bay. You can go to Salty's for fish and chips and then feed the seals.  Clive's has the best drinks, Vista 18 has the best night time views, and Discovery has the best donuts."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,spacegirl_spiff,17,Wed May 27 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"Day 1 - breakfast @ Jam Walk to Ocean River Sports & rent a kayak for a bay tour  Back to the car and head over to Cook Street Village to grab a coffee and make your way down to Dallas Road for a walkabout.  If its a Sat morning head Moss Street Market for local eats and buys  Back to the car and grab lunch at any of the nearby food trucks, my recommendation is Tacofino  After lunch I would head over to Oak Bay Ave for another stroll and some sight seeing, maybe duck into Rogers chocolates for a local sweet or maybe a stop in the Penny Farthing for a local pint.  Late afternoon, maybe a drive through the Uplands to see how the other half live and maybe a stop off at Cadboro Bay beach Supper time is a great time downtown and there are many to choose from, I personally like SpiceJammer and Cafe Brio but use the Open Table app and save yourself calling everywhere for a reservation.  Back to the inner harbor for a nice nightcap at the Bengal Lounge  Day 2 - grab an early bite Shine Cafe and maybe a coffee from Discovery Coffee and then head up to Port Renfrew stopping at the various beaches and odd bakery  Day 3\4 - if you have the time, I would highly recommend an overnight in Alert Bay (not much to see there) but the drive is nice and the Wildlife Sailboat Tour is amazing, if that is not your thing, a trip over to Salt Spring for the day is worth it and if its a weekend, you might be able to hit up the farmers market.  If you make your way out towards Salt Spring, you should stop in and check out Sidney, they also have a night market.  Some honourable mentions and activities;  Whale Tours  Victoria Museum  Red Barn Sandwich  Swim\Hang out for the day in the Oak Bay Beach Hotel pool right on the water  Since it is a couples trip, Empress Spa is worth a massage stop in  Inner Harbour Pickle Pub tour to visit several pubs in a unique way  That's all I got for right now, enjoy Vic and the island, its a Pacific paradise."

VictoriaBC,37gk4v,Gmart,2,Wed May 27 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"For parka I recommend walking around Beacon Hill Park near downtown. It is beautiful and there are ducks, turtles and herons there right now (also seagulls and crows but you center find those anywhere).  If you like artsy stuff, try looking for studio tour route. There are lots of artisans near downtown and out in the sticks (Metchosin,  Sooke). For artsy you can also try the Gulf Islands.  Finally, the Bengal Lounge in the Empress Hotel offers a change every go travel back in time to Imperial Britain in the 1920s. Rxcelleng classi  drinks. The prices are very 21st century though."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,drag_free_drift,2,Wed May 27 16:00:29 2015 UTC,Victoria has an amazing coffee culture and breakfast culture! Places to check out:  Coffee: Habit coffee. Discovery coffee. Cafe fantastico.  Breakfast: shine cafe. Jam. The blue fox. Floyd's diner. John's place.
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,JoIIyRanter,2,Wed May 27 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Well, Victoria's not really big enough to hide eateries well. You'll still see them all over Urban Spoon and Trip Advisor. The trick is separating the top tourist places from the actually good places. There already seems to be good advice in this thread. A couple places I don't see mentioned much, but I really like is Nourish, although they're starting to appear more and more on the lists. Otherwise just follow the reat of the advice given out in this thread.  You are a musician, so maybe you're into open mics? There are some good open mics, along with great talent in Victoria. I'm hoping people will chime in with their favorite, but the one I've always gone to is on Thursday evenings at the [Fernwood Inn](www.fernwoodinn.com)."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,Iamonabike,2,Wed May 27 17:08:36 2015 UTC,"Prohibition Era-esque bar: Little Jumbo  http://littlejumbo.ca/  If you didn't know it was there, you'd walk right by it.   The front entrance is indicated by a small nondescript purple neon elephant.  Upon entering the first door off the street, there is a hallway that leads towards what could easily be confused for a broom closet.   Once inside, its one room, with a bar, and a handful of tables along a brick wall. Decorated like its the 1930s. No windows. Very hip. Very hush hush.   Great food. Amazing drink menu.  For Victoria Dining, its on the higher price end.   But based on my prejudices regarding your professions, I'd say this is down your alley.  Easily one of the best places in town."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,Threpid,2,Thu May 28 11:41:13 2015 UTC,"As an artist and a quirky person, I loved Little Jumbo. The atmosphere was fun and unique. The drinks were slightly high but the food was good. You may need to order a few things to be full but small amounts of assorted things gives you options and diversity.  the experience is worth it."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,BeeBuzzzz,0,Sat May 30 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"little jumbo is the worst.    Prices seem okay although drinks are a bit on the high end for what you get.  Food is just average but extremely small portions, good luck getting full without a couple appys and 2 main courses each.  Atmosphere is kinda strange."

Tacos: Hernande'z  Delicious and trendy: Part and Parcel Raw and delicious: Bliss  Coffee: Discovery, Habit, Fantastico  Liquor: Cocktails- Bengal Lounge              Beer: The Drake              Whiskey: The Churchill              Gin: Smiths              Bourbon: The Guild              Cider: Merridale or Sea Cidery          (both orchards out of town) Atmosphere bars: Copper Owl for music and decor, Logans for crustpunk and sunday hootenany, Big Bad Johns for peanut tossing and bra-laden ceilings... Breakfast: Mole, Jam, and Bluefox are trend favourites but I like Cabin 12 for atmosphere, Shine for food, and Floyds for happiness.  Novelty: Beacon Drive In for ice cream to eat while wandering Beacon Hill looking at herons and peacocks and watch for duck poop!  Markets: Moss St market on saturday, Hudson Public Market Sounds like you guys would dig flea market on sunday, ooo then go to the hootenany!  Art: Gorgeous setting in Colwood at Coast Collective beside Esquimalt Lagoon. Moss St Art Gallery, a few places downtown- Couch, Madronas, etc. Favourite collection in a shop is side street studio in oak bay, all local artists lots of pottery, wood pieces, and jewelry. Fifty fifty collective, ministry of casual living, and pedal box gallery are things you should definitely internet.  Thrifting: st Paul de vincent best for price, then salvation army, then value village. Vintage Funk and the Patch are popular too.  Consignment stores nonclothes- super chance in James Bay, good things consignment in oak bay. Fun shop full of mod decor and furniture- easy livin.   The harbour is great to stroll around and people watch, listen to buskers, talk to locals. You'll probably really like Solstice Cafe for hangs and art on the walls, might be some banjo pickin or spoken word there too. Summit park- quiet and beautiful, moss rock park, Gonzales beach- young people and doggies and it's sandy, gyro beach for fun playground stuff, wittys lagoon for waterfall and 1.3 km hike down through trail beside marsh to the ocean.  Ohmygoodness I had no idea I knew this many random things you might like. And there is so much more... find the random pianos around the city. Make a bull kelp xylophone on the beach, build a driftwood fort, climb trees in beacon hill, mini golf (bring your own putters) in beacon, roam russells used bookstore- ooo and grab chocolate from the place across the street, it's the best!"

VictoriaBC,37gk4v,schmuck55,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Secondhand shops: Fort street has a number of vintage/secondhand furniture shops and auction houses. Charmaine's is my favourite. Also, Vintage Funk on Johnson is a great little shop, all kinds of knick knacky stuff and also clothing and shoes. And The Patch for clothes, also it's a bit hipstery/""curated"" (if you know what I mean) so the prices are a little higher.   Fan Tan Alley is touristy enough that you probably know about it already if you've read any tourist guides, but the record shop in there is definitely worth hitting up. Lots of great records and old posters.   Oh, and maybe this is weird but the Value Village in town is one of the best I've ever been to. Not hip or indie by any stretch :) but I always find great stuff there (especially housewares)"

VictoriaBC,37gk4v,schmuck55,1 point,Wed May 27 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"Haha, to each their own I guess. What don't you like about it? It's pricier than it used to be, but that's true of most thrift shops. To be truthful I don't care much about the clothes (and I almost never have the patience to look through them). But I can always find something I want in the dishes/kitchen stuff, the shoes and purses, or the artwork section along the wall, and there's more selection in those sections than most other VVs I've been to. Maybe my personal style just lends itself well to stuff that downsizing retirees give away :)"
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,sometimes_i_work,2,Wed May 27 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Ya the prices really kill me. It's definitely the highest I've seen.

VictoriaBC,37gk4v,schmuck55,2,Wed May 27 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"I get you! But bigger cities are a mixed blessing I find, more competition from other shoppers scooping up the good stuff before you get there! I used to live in Montreal and I found that unless I was very strategic about when I shopped, the stores got pretty picked over."
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,sometimes_i_work,1 point,Wed May 27 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"Check out Olo for a cool, fancy, farm-to-table dinner. All local food, seafood heavy, and will give you a really good idea of Vancouver Island foods.   For Second-hand shops, check out Maven's, it's close to Jam, so make a morning/afternoon of it. The Patch is also pretty cool, but massive and popular so often it's expensive and picked over.   If you like pool, go play a round at Peacock Billiard's. Cool art, all based on James Joyce's writing (check out the hand painted bar).  For fun, romantic, outdoorsy stuff I highly recommend renting a car and checking out Goldstream Park, the Sooke potholes, and beaches along the Juan de Fuca trail, depending on how far you want to drive.   Also, eat sushi. Some of the best you'll have in North America. Ebizo (get their sunamono salad), Sen Zushi (get their special kappa maki - fish or veggie are amazing), and The Next are all top spots.    Fisherman's wharf is a nice little walk to grab lunch (The Fish Store for fish tacos!) and ice cream, feed the seals, and poke around all the cool boat houses.   If your lady's an artist, I'd suggest the Moss St. Art Gallery. They might even have a cool exhibit or event going on while you're here, check the schedule.   Mazel Tov! Enjoy the city :)"
VictoriaBC,37gk4v,hankexfa,1 point,Wed May 27 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"Food: Koto on Fort near Warf St is the best Japanese in town (I've been to many). Big Wheel Burger on Cook Street (in the village) is the place for burgers/fries/onion rings. For appy's and wine, Stage Wine Bar is hard to beat (Veneto was mentioned already). Amazing selections of small plates and wines - great ambiance too. In the heart of Fernwood village on Gladstone.    Pubs: Canoe patio (already mentioned) and Spinnakers.   Edit: as I put it in another comment, everyone's opinion is subjective as to ""best this or best that"". But pretty much everything mentioned in this thread will stand up and not disappoint.

We started at Spinnakers and made our way over the Bay St Bridge (this was the worst part, scenery wise) then hit Moon Under Water, Hoyne, VIB, Phillips, Canoe, and finished at Swans. It was a hilariously good time. By the time you get to Canoe or Swans - it's usually a good time to get some food to try to soak up some of the delicious beer.  Edit** At Breweries like Hoyne that only have a small Growler Station/Tasting Area, be considerate and purchase some bomber bottles to have later."

Twenty years ago, before the park was created, I parked my car on the road and spent the night at Mystic Beach. The next day someone had broken in and had stolen some CD's and clothing. Nothing serious. The road can still get pretty weird sometimes..."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,MrYYJ,2,Tue May 26 17:10:34 2015 UTC,I used to drive through Alaska and saw bullet holes in the highway signs and thought that Canadians were better than that... then I took a drive up past Port Renfrew...
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,nrtphotos,2,Wed May 27 02:33:26 2015 UTC,jordan river and the mainline to bear creek is a hot spot for stolen cars and drinking/partying. it's not a family friendly camping area once you get into some of the recent clear cutting and it become the hydro road. local kids will drive all the way up to the reservoir and get drunk before driving 20+k back on the mainline to get back home.
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,teamleda,3,Tue May 26 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Forebay Rd near the powerlines is now blocked off ( I heard about 10 min off the highway) and they will be installing a gate.. No more getting up to the reservoirs . Never had any issues up there myself. Usually long weekends were to be avoided. Weeks Lake used to have some weird vibes and a bad party spot but CRD has heavily cracked down on that in the last few years.. There is fewer and fewer logging roads to explore as they get shut down due to vandalism, bush parties and the garbage left behind etc."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,nrtphotos,0,Tue May 26 21:58:11 2015 UTC,i'm not familiar with forebay road. i usually take the east main hydro road up to the reservoir. it's a shitty road but it's the only easy access that i'm aware of.
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,teamleda,4,Tue May 26 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Most of the roads off Forebay rd are blocked. Forebay is the road just before you come into Jordan River, it sucks as I just found out through facebook it was shut was going to take a drive up to the reservoir  one of these days. There is a gravel road just past that that dead ends and side roads used to connect to Forebay.  Look up  South Island Motorized Recreation Advisory Council on facebook. I am one of those few who dont cut locks on gates or create ways around. Then again I just have a regular vehicle no 4x4 or lift kit but most of that area WAS easy to access now and it's getting harder and harder to explore on the lower island with out either CRD shutting it down, The logging company gating it due to theft of vandislism or out of control parties, garbage dumping again (  Stop illegal garbage dumping - Vancouver island on facebook)"

VictoriaBC,37a7fc,mimetic-polyalloy,1 point,Wed May 27 02:30:47 2015 UTC,If you go up forebay and take a left at the first intersection you will eventually get to a big open gravel pit area. It has been a popular spot for target shooting.

VictoriaBC,37a7fc,Bender248,1 point,Tue May 26 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"I used to climb Mt. Arrowsmith quite often, first time the group I was with finished the hike a little late so we decided to camp at the makeshift parking lot at the bottom. For some reason I set my tent next to my car almost on the road. Around midnight a bunch of 4x4 and pick-up trucks started rolling by at speeds at least greater than 80km/h, they did a couple drive-by throwing empty cans and blasting music, honking their horns to make sure we were awake and annoyed."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,nrtphotos,-9,Sat May 30 14:31:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, what he did was actually pretty stupid. NO ONE leaves their car on the side of a logging road overnight, it's just plain stupid. It's different if you are parked in a well used campsite with other vehicles, but just pulling over at an access point and leaving it was just stupid. This happens on a regular basis, it just doesn't get reported by the media. I personally found a brand new Tundra that was torched by Burnt Bridge a couple years ago. The owner left it overnight on the road after getting a flat, and local kids came out at night and torched it.   Basically, don't leave your car overnight on logging roads."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,ShiftlessBum,25,Tue May 26 15:54:41 2015 UTC,"No offence intended but it doesn't sound like you're a backpacker/backcountry skiier. I've left my car parked overnight (and for multiple nights) on various logging roads throughout the province, so far (knock on wood) the only time I've had my car vandalized it was in a front country campground parking lot - windows smashed and battery stolen from the vehicle.  Like anything though ""blaming"" the guy for doing nothing wrong is a little strange. Instead we need to target the people that do these kinds of things and see that they are held accountable for what they've done.  Be a shitty way to end a fantastic hike into the backcountry."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,VicCity,9,Tue May 26 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've left my vehicle on logging roads more times than I can count."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,teamleda,6,Tue May 26 17:15:40 2015 UTC,Likewise never had any issues. Also slept in the back of my vehicle on many occasions with out issue. You just keep the window open a crack and your ears open and you'll sleep fine. I have also left my vehicle parked in such a fashion that should I need to leave in the even of an emergency or weirdness I don't have to worry about taking my time to get turned around or backed up. If the road dead ends I just block the road sideways with my vehicle if I am tenting with the tent behind my vehicle to avoid some yahoo running over the tent.  Ive had the local police and fish and game check on me but never had any issues. It just comes down to always being aware of your surroundings and never assuming your alone in the bush.  I think it may also depend on the vehicle parked on the logging road as well
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,nrtphotos,-2,Tue May 26 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"I've spent plenty of time in the woods, it's a terrible idea to leave your car on the side of the road. 4x4 guys will drag their trucks out on the oil pan rather than leave it for someone to torch on the road."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,ShiftlessBum,7,Tue May 26 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"It may be ""terrible"" but if you want to do overnight or multi-night trips than there aren't a lot of other options.   When you think about the sheer number of people out and about in this province the vehicle vandalism isn't that high, but you're right in saying you should be careful where you leave it."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,nrtphotos,1 point,Tue May 26 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"this was a brand new tundra that was torched a few years ago at burnt bridge, the guy made the mistake of leaving his truck with a flat on the road and we woke up to the tires exploding in the early morning as the truck was engulfed in flames.  some areas are worse than others, but any of the mainlines around shawnigan, duncan and jordan river you are asking for trouble if you leave a vehicle overnight unattended. there are some wild parties and lot's of drinking that goes on during the night."
VictoriaBC,37a7fc,teamleda,1 point,Tue May 26 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"Never had issues around Shawnigan or Duncan or Jordan River camping, then again I have my vehicle set up in such a way I can leave at a moment's notice . Just had one really creepy odd experience near the koksliah gated bridge..Other times if you stumble across a bush party camp ABOVE them not on the side of the road below them as in theory you avoid getting disturbed by them and or your vehicle hit by a possible drunk. Also you are not guilty by association if the police show up."

VictoriaBC,37a7fc,teamleda,2,Tue May 26 21:43:59 2015 UTC,Cary a super bright flash light or hit your car alarm a few times right as you hear something or someone right next to your vehicle its good for shits and giggles but it also scares them away.. Yep depending on who it is it's enough to scare the shit out of who ever it is.. They also tend to leave you alone if they notice people sleeping at least in my experience but I do sleep with the window cracked to hear noise on either side of my vehicle.

VictoriaBC,37f7tk,Numerolophile,6,Wed May 27 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"comparing a potential rape case to petty theft in terms of resources is pretty absurd. a rape case would be handled by a very specialized group of officers/resources. it's not something a beat cop would be handling. i'll admit, the officer in the recording used some pretty poor choices of wording to explain the situation to the mother. however, it's completely unrealistic to expect the police to swoop in and arrest the guy or place him on leave from work without a completely thorough investigation that looks at both sides.   i don't blame the mother at all, but i think this could have been handled by both sides a lot better. obviously VICPD won't comment on this due to the sensitive nature of the subject."
VictoriaBC,37f7tk,nrtphotos,8,Wed May 27 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"Mom made an allegation against her ex - who is presently someone who has an allegation of sexual assault made against him, not ""a pedophile"" - and it's been less than two weeks.  Many sexual assaults, where the victims are actually still at risk of being victimized, take months to investigate.  There's no indication the ex has access to the child, or that she's currently in danger.  As the PR officer points out, mom may have actually made it harder to gather evidence for a charge, by giving the alleged offender a giant heads-up of the investigation - surely he's capable of recognizing her voice on TV.   Basically: this is the narcissism of someone who doesn't understand the point of operating procedures, or triaging more urgent matters over less urgent ones - or doesn't care, because other people and their sexual assault cases just aren't real to her. It's also empty fearmongering on the part of CTV, but that's less noteworthy."
VictoriaBC,37f7tk,dentonite,-4,Wed May 27 05:22:44 2015 UTC,on the earlier broadcast they stated he works with children.  perhaps they should keep the victim updated and not tell them they are understaffed and that its not a priority if they don't want the victim to go to the media in desperation.

VictoriaBC,37f7tk,dentonite,3,Wed May 27 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"on the earlier broadcast they stated he works with children.   Funny how they took that out of the later broadcast/web clip then, eh? Almost like they might have learned that might not have been factual enough to repeat.    perhaps they should keep the victim updated and not tell them they are understaffed and that its not a priority if they don't want the victim to go to the media in desperation.   Again: less than two weeks. She records her calls, with the express intent of bringing them to the media. That's not desperation; that's self-centred petulance at not being given priority over things that are, presumably, actually more urgent."

I think its a $500 fine (or was), one time we got fined and they split it amongst the group so it wasn't that bad.

You may end up paying more and often they want a pet deposit on top of the security deposit.  (Generally instead of half a months rent security deposit they require the entire months rent)
VictoriaBC,3784n6,TechnicallyITsCoffee,4,Mon May 25 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"it's not easy with dogs. my old management company pulled the plug because of shitty owners. we had people leaving waste bags at the door, dogs pissing on the floor and basically not taking any responsibility."
VictoriaBC,3784n6,nrtphotos,2,Mon May 25 18:08:35 2015 UTC,Hi so Victoria has gotten much much better for pet friendly places. They are a bit more expensive then usual but that is pretty normal. Look on both craigslist and usedvictoria both have pet filters. I know there are a few apartments on Gorge Road and one giant complex on Cook and Maplewood allows dogs (this one even provides poo bags). I have found it easy to find a place with a small dog however now I have 2 dogs and one is big so it is a lot harder.
VictoriaBC,3784n6,raysmale,2,Mon May 25 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"IIRC, there are only about two or three buildings in the city that are pet-friendly rentals and most have waiting lists. You may have more success renting a suite in a house."

VictoriaBC,374v7l,nordhammer,18,Sun May 24 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Parts of downtown are truly god-awful in terms of everything. The rent is usually very high for a drafty suite that hasn't been through a proper renno in 20 years, or its a new suite and is three times as expensive. Plus parking and driving downtown is only for the truly patient.  Uptown is... Just don't. Some nice neighborhoods around the area, to be sure, and the buses seem to hub up nicely. But aside from shopping at the mall it is a bit of a wasteland for things to do, besides the gentleman's club down the way. Friend of mine lived near there for a while in an apartment, he biked everywhere and seemed to enjoy the locale.   Gordon Head is nice to drive through, but afraid I don't know much more than that.  I'm gonna be super unpopular and say that Oak Bay isn't too bad. Oak Bay Village is pretty swank, nice parks and close to the water, but you'd better off your parents, make it look like an accident, and use your inheritance to pay for the first few months of living there. I got lucky and was sharing a house there for several months with four other people. Nice house, nice neighborhood, but I was definitely the dude with the longest hair on the block.  James Bay has some fun spots, great views, and most of it is close enough to town where you can just jaunt on over. However, my experience with the people living in James Bay is that they are all horrible old people who fear change like the grim aspect of the reaper's scythe that hangs over their wrinkly heads. Friend of mine was living in an apartment out that way for a few years with his lady. We once had the cops called on us while we were waiting for a bus that was super late, so I hate James Bay.  Fernwood, however, is where it is at. I lived there for many years and there is an abundance of parks, pubs, delis, a theater, a kilt store, and all kinds of people just hanging from the rafters. In the summer, we used to play a drinking game when we went walking around in the afternoon. Any time we passed someone playing an acoustic guitar, we hit the flask. It was a very popular game. Fernwood is also well connected to the rest of town, 15 minutes to almost anywhere by bus or car.  Another one is Esquimal. Some good parts, some rough parts, and some parts that just kinda caught fire. There is a lot of new stuff coming up in my area, a few malls, decent regular buses, good restaurants and pubs (Moon Under Water is just a bridge away!), but the problem is the bridges and traffic down Admirals road. There are some times of day when it would probably be quicker to walk... With another person tied to one of your legs like those horrible 3-legged races we did as kids."
VictoriaBC,374v7l,nihilisticzealot,1 point,Mon May 25 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Wow you lucked out on the rent lottery, but yea Oak Bay has some super fun parts. By far, my favorite of all the Bays."
VictoriaBC,374v7l,nihilisticzealot,7,Mon May 25 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"Here are the areas I am most familiar with, besides downtown:  Fernwood is my favourite part of town.  Very relaxed, with lots of cats.  It has a youthful energy.  Great place to walk around at night.  Jubilee is awesome.  It hardly exists at all.  It's the vague area where Oak Bay and Fernwood collide, trending more on the Oak Bay way of things.  Check out the Discovery Coffee (it's on Oak Bay Avenue, but technically in the Jubilee area).  Oak Bay is a very odd place.  Very anachronistic.  The village is nice, and the beaches are great.  The people are typically very nice, but very old.  Check out the Ambrosia deli for an awesome panini (literally called the 'Awesome Panini').  Uplands is half beautiful park and half super rich area.  It's so upper class that they have a deal with BC transit to turn off the interior bus lights as they are driving through the area.  Make sure you check out Cattle Point.  You can the coast down to Willows Beach.  Neither Uplands or Oak Bay are technically part of Victoria, but ""Greater Victoria"" is far more useful a division, including Saanich, Oak Bay, Esquimalt, and Victoria.  Maybe Sidney and North Saanich can come too."
VictoriaBC,374v7l,Radiohead_Riverrun,4,Tue May 26 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"We moved to Cook St village area last year and we love it. Everything is nearby (although not as many choices as Fernwood). You have groceries, pubs, coffee houses, pharmacy, post office, restaurants, medical clinics, etc. Plus, it's close to Beacon Hill, close to Dallas Rd and the ocean, close to downtown. Love it!"
VictoriaBC,374v7l,katto,3,Sun May 24 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the Highrock area of Esquimalt and had a happy childhood there. The houses have good sized yards, the  streets are safe, there a big park to explore and decent schools.  I also lived in James Bay for 10 years and loved it. Close enough to walk downtown and has a great community vibe.  Unfortunately its over run by tourist in the summer which gets a little aggravating and streets get closed down for various events like parades and races but it's not the end of the world. Although getting stuck behind one of those horse carriages can make your blood boil if you're in a hurry.  I now live downtown and quite like it. It is a bit noisy but you get used to it and I lucked out when I bought my condo because I purchased a unit that faces an interior courtyard which cuts down on the noise immensely. Personally, I feel safe downtown at night although I have some friends who don't. I walk my dog before bed and once in a rare while I run into some who makes me uncomfortable enough to turn around and go the other way but not often. I am not saying I am was in imminent danger, I just got a bad vibe and as a single woman, I like to listen to my intuition and not take chances."

Sometimes there are some youths on a Friday or Sat night roaming streets, but they are usually just walking home from a party or something. Lots of parks, 5 mins from the water, 15-20 mins to downtown, 30 mins from ferry. It's just a well-rounded neighbourhood."

At least on your side of the counter you don't have to talk to them."
VictoriaBC,374v7l,FlatteredPawn,8,Mon May 25 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to move there or visit there?  Do you have a job lined up or are you going to look when you get here?  Are you going to UVic or Camosun?  Are you a single person, are you moving with a family?   How old are you, what are your hobbies?   Let me know, I've been here for decades and can give you anything you want to know.  I moved around a lot as a kid so I can fill you in on any neighbourhood.   Our bus service is all right, but frankly embarrassing for a major city.  You can get around, but plan on it taking some time.  I used to run to work downtown, and sometimes it would take me longer to bus home than it did to run in in the morning.  (And it was usually close.)  Biking is probably the sanest way to get around, although there are a handful of drivers that are terrible at sharing.  There's a big trail that links most of Greater Victoria.  (There are actually 13 municipalities (mini-cities) here, all with their own mayor, police, fire, etc.)   Bring money.  Houses start around $400k, condos for about $300k, and they'll go up from there.  Rent will be north of a grand unless you are sharing or find a pretty sweet deal.    Because of that high cost, there aren't really any ""bad"" areas of town.  It gets dark and empty at night, and most of the city shuts down around 6pm on any given day.  The pubs will be open until 2am.    Downside is there isn't a ton of work here.  Our top industry is our tech field, and that's partly because of a few local success stories plus an endless supply of cheap labour from the university.  Once you get some experience though, you're out the door for someone who will work more hours for less pay.   What hobbies do you like?  We've got some of the best diving water in the world, but you'll have to suit up.  There are hiking and biking trails, climbing gyms, mountains, sailing associations, parks, beaches, anything you want to do outdoors, it's here.    The West Shore is where most of the new people to town end up moving to.  They've been expanding in the last few years, lots of new condos, lots of decent restaurants, yoga studios, pubs, that sort of thing.  Most of the night life, such as it is, will be downtown.  Thursdays are the cheaper nights for drinks, so you'll see more students there.  Friday and Saturday will be the usual crowds.  There is a lot of live music going on, but most of the shows will end earlier than you'd expect.  Which is great, because you can go to bed early and get a better start on the next day.    Unless you're sitting on a couple million, you're not getting into Uplands or Oak Bay.  They're totally gentrified, plus most of the people there speak with a fake English accent because they really, really, want to be British.  I don't know why.   The sketchiest places would be in Esquimalt, due mostly to old houses built for Navy folks (although career folks tend to live in West Shore vs. near the base) and right downtown (say hello to my little friends, the bedbugs).  Oh shit, right, and Rock Bay, although if you've living there you're probably sleeping in the industrial park at night and streetwalking during the day.  There might be ... 4, maybe 5 houses there, the rest are businesses.  Don't rent there.  If you're being forced to at gunpoint it'll be easier to just get shot.  Not that anyone has a gun, mind you.  If the police find someone with a gun, they come down like a ton of bricks.  Actually, the opposite, since they deploy helicopters.    There are restaurants to feed any diet; vegan, paleo, gluten-free, etc.    Uptown is the name of a new mall, I haven't heard it used for the name of a place.  It's close to where I live, it's not a bad neighbourhood at all."

Quadra Village - Close to Downtown and close grocery/liquor store, etc but can be a sketchy area at times.  Grocery store isn't the greatest either.  Gordon Head/UVic - Great to be close to school, but quite far from town and pretty much impossible to walk home from the downtown core.  Fairfield - Awesome area, beautiful homes and very nice people.  Close to downtown, easy to walk, nice to be close to the beach.  Gets windy/stormy quite often and the bus service tends to be poor.  Fernwood - My favorite area of town, the perfect mix of convenience, access while still feeling like you're not anywhere near the city.  Very nice community spirit, and easy bus service from Fort Street.  Only downside is there is no close grocery, you'll either have to walk or take your vehicle.  Fernhood for the win!"

VictoriaBC,374v7l,corvus7corax,1 point,Mon May 25 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy walking it's actually quite feasible to walk to Gordon head from downtown Vic. I used to do it every weekend.   Likewise, a 30 minute walk from Fernwood to the ocean should be easy for any healthy human with functional legs.   Maybe I'm bias because I've been living without a car for 10 years, but walking is the most natural way to get around. We live in a time of instant gratification but I think the process of walking to a destination is enjoyable in itself."

He also took to performing a kind of ""talking blues""-style guitar busking on Government St. 4-5 years ago.

VictoriaBC,374v7l,yghgjy,1 point,Sat May 30 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"James Bay, bit of a trek to school if you have kids.  Great walking locations close to the ocean.  Quick and easy drive/walk downtown.  Nice quiet area, gets a bit of cruise ship traffic in the summer but not a big deal.  has a couple okay resturants but for most shopping (other then groceries) you'll be heading into town.  Fortunately its 2 km trip to downtown.  Oak Bay, Its outskirts aren't nearly as nice as James Bay but as you get closer to the water it is very similar, really depends on your price range.  Has one of the best public schools in Victoria. Oak bay village has some cool little specialty shops.  A bit further from downtown then James Bay but also has more amenities itself.  Uptown - I'm not sure of this as a region of the city but if you just mean the uptown shopping center it has some shopping a wallmart and daycare.  Haven't been into any of the condos in the area.  The surrounding neighborhoods are alright.  Not as nice as James bay or Oak bay.  I'm not sure exactly what area you're qualifying as uptown.  I lived in South saanich growing up and it seemed like a nice enough middle class place to raise a kid.  Bit of a further trip to downtown and the ocean.  Gorden Head - very residential, think suburb full of single detached homes, mount doug is a good high school.  Close to uvic so rent can be a bit high.  Lots of houses with basement suites rented to students so there may be the odd annoying neighbour (based on my recollection of going to parties in the area).  Railyards - A collection of condos kind of between Esquimalt and gorge area.  I lived here for a few years and really enjoyed it.  They are mostly smallish condos 600-1000sqft.  Right on bike paths that go downtown and all over.  20 minute walk downtown.  Much quieter then downtown and right near the water.  Esquimalt - I currently live in south Esquimalt.  The further south you get (closer to the ocean) the nicer it is.  Kind of has a feel of an older mount doug that is closer to downtown.  Smaller lots and cheaper so you run into some worst areas.  But anything 2 blocks south of Esquimalt road is really nice, short walk to the beach and only several minute drive to downtown."

VictoriaBC,372ajb,Yangel,3,Sun May 24 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"Chiton:       Chitons /ˈkaɪtənz/ are small to large marine molluscs in the class Polyplacophora, formerly known as Amphineura.  About 940   extant and 430  fossil species are recognized.  They are also sometimes known as sea cradles or ""coat-of-mail shells"", or more formally as loricates, polyplacophorans, and occasionally as polyplacophores.  Chitons have a dorsal shell which is composed of eight separate shell plates or valves. These plates overlap somewhat at the front and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, although the plates provide good protection for impacts from above, they nonetheless permit the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and also allow the animal to slowly curl up into a ball when it is dislodged from the underlying surface.  The shell plates are surrounded by a structure known as a girdle.

VictoriaBC,372p24,vicgeo,7,Sun May 24 09:15:00 2015 UTC,"As a landlord, we always have our tenants sign year long rental agreements that state the contract ends after a year. If we wind up having shitty tenants it's easy to end the lease, if they're good we offer them another year. If it goes month to month at the end of the year then we have no real way to get them to leave without major headaches. We give them notice around two months prior to the end of the year either offering another year or telling them it's over, that way we have time to advertise and get new tenants if they aren't staying. Just thought I'd let you know my end of things."

VictoriaBC,370ot6,Szteto_Anztian,3,Sat May 23 19:45:42 2015 UTC,The best argument is that an upper-tier municipality with thirteen lower-tier ones makes less sense than amalgamation into a single-tier Greater Victoria.
VictoriaBC,370ot6,dentonite,6,Sun May 24 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"The Capital Regional District isn't unusual. Many areas of Vancouver Island and the rest BC use similar bodies.  It's better to think about it more like an extension of municipal government rather than a whole different level. The politicians who sit on the CRD board are just some of the mayors and councillors from around the region. Each of our 13 Greater Victoria municipalities get to appoint a certain number of board members from their councils depending on their size (as in, Victoria gets more than North Saanich and so on).  So, why does it exist and what does it do?  All of these 13 separate cities and towns that make up the Victoria area have to work together for some things. It makes more sense to share services like regional parks, hospitals, sewage treatment, water and watershed management, garbage and recycling collection... etc. So the CRD is a place where the 13 municipalities get together, vote on things of a regional nature and have staff that are dedicated to those issues.  Why do people want to disband it?  I don't know, I'm sure there are lots of reasons. But sometime I believe the anger is misguided. For example, the way the CRD has handled the sewage treatment project has been unpopular. But who is to blame? In my opinion it's the politicians making the decisions. Who are they? Your local mayors and councillors who also sit on the CRD Board.  So I think anger over decisions made by the CRD is best expressed at the ballot box of your local municipal election. I can't help but think one of the reasons long time Saanich mayor Frank Leonard and Victoria Mayor Dean Fortin were voted out of office last year  was anger at how the sewage project was going. Now we have two new mayors -- Saanich's Richard Atwell and Victoria's Lisa Helps -- pushing the project in a new direction.  That got long winded. I don't know if it answers your question. I think a lot of people hate the CRD without a good understanding of what it is."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,PR-Ice,6,Sun May 24 01:06:25 2015 UTC,"They can be rather bureaucratic. Spend public money and annex land that isn't specifically in the majority public interest, usually to benefit what can seem like a private agenda. The CRD as a whole is not necessarily ""terrible"", they do provide a lot of good services, but there has been a history of bureaucratic behaviour coming from an agency that is supposed to serve the public."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,_Sinusoidal,8,Sat May 23 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"Most places have 3 levels of government: municipal, provincial, and federal.   The CRD decided it needed to exist as an additional fourth level of regional government. And our taxes pay for it. And their handling of the sewage treatment planning process has been costly and ineffective.   They generally govern things that a lot of people think don't need governing. Like closing access to the sooke watershed. That's the one I'm most unhappy about."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,cashewbutts,6,Sat May 23 23:50:15 2015 UTC,"The CRD decided it needed to exist as an additional fourth level of regional government.    The Province created the regional government model to allow for coordination of local government issues.  There are many RDs across the province and they generally work well. ""The CRD"" didn't create itself.  I won't get too far into the Sooke watershed access thing but I'll say that there are very few water sources as protected and pristine as ours in North America.  We are extremely lucky to have more water than we need and water that needs minimal treatment.  There are hundreds (maybe thousands) of towns/cities in North America that wish they had our reservoir system."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,PM_UR_YOGA_PANT_PICS,5,Sun May 24 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"This. Every single area of BC is covered by a regional district. They did not create themselves. They also provide governance to all those unincorporated areas in the province who are not formal towns or cities or district municipalities. The regional district model is absolutely essential. If cities within the CRD amalgamate, it will have no impact of the structure of the CRD other than the amount of people on their Board.  People need to learn a bit more about government structure in Canada before they toss things around like ""dismantle the CRD"". Dismantle the municipalities within the CRD sure, but guess what folks, the CRD is here to stay."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,shoeflack,8,Sun May 24 21:31:06 2015 UTC,their handling of the sewage treatment planning process has been costly and ineffective.   I've also heard a large portion of the problem is people not wanting it in their backyard.
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,7,Sun May 24 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"True. Nobody wants a sewage treatment plant in their neighbourhood. But the CRD purchased a site in esquimalt without any community consultation. That enraged people. And then when the site failed community consultation, they had to sell it for a loss of millions. It has been really poorly managed."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,cashewbutts,-2,Sun May 24 01:52:17 2015 UTC,Why do people really give a shit? I went to a high school with one right next to it with no problem. Even on the hottest days in kelowna in or near the 40's it didn't smell. Fuck I'd take one in my backyard over the alternative of this city STILL pumping it straight into the ocean. People in this city are ridiculous.   Do they think it's going to lower their homes value or something? Cause if that's the case I'll go to every buyer when they try to sell and make sure they know that victoria still pumps sewage into the ocean untreated. I wonder how much the value will drop then.
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,14,Sun May 24 01:59:49 2015 UTC,There is no environmental problem with pumping it to sea. We have unique oceanic geography that can handle it just fine. People who don't understand the science get emotional about it. They treatment plant they were proposing to build wouldn't even remove heavy metals and hormonal pollutants. It was a one billion dollar feel-good project.   Source: masters degree in earth and ocean science from uvic.
VictoriaBC,370ot6,cashewbutts,-12,Sun May 24 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"There is no environmental problem with pumping it to sea.   I'm sorry? I call complete bullshit. You are saying that sewage for a population of 340k being dumped, untreated, in a localized area is not going to have an effect. As well as that sewage from cities does not just contain piss and shit.   Is that correct? It was sustainable when Victoria was alot smaller. But as it grows and grows its going to catch up."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,6,Sun May 24 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if I search ""Vancouver Island sewage treatment"" the first hit is this National Post article. It includes quotes from David Anderson, a former federal environment minister, Chris Garrett, a retired University of Victoria oceanographer, and chief health officers for B.C., Vancouver Island and the Victoria region, all speaking against the project.  Gonna have to side with cashewbutts here. Minimal Googling effort shows his claim to be extremely credible."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,Nimnio,-3,Sun May 24 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing against/for the project itself. I'm arguing the idea that there is no environmental problem with pumping untreated sewage into the ocean.   Every day, an estimated 80 million litres of flushed detritus are funnelled through six mm mesh screens   They also go on to say,   the vast majority of the effluent is water.   But water, shit and piss is not the only thing the raw sewage waste contains. And funneling through the mesh does not remove these items. Like household cleaning products, which many are toxic if consumed or just aren't very friendly to wildlife. Bleach, for example, doesn't play well with fish.   As the city grows, the amount of toxic chemicals used through out the city will grow as well (unless, as pointed out later on, it's stopped from entering in the first place).   Nobody denies that Victoria’s sewage is not having some impact, of course, but scientists maintain the harm is simply not worthy of a 10-figure fix.   He/she denied it by saying:   There is no environmental problem with pumping it to sea.   As well, the harm may not be a 10-figure fix right now. But what about the future. Thinking about just ""the now,"" has lead to many mistakes concerning our environment. The impact of fossil fuels and our ozone layer, or fish populations affected by unsustainable fishing practices because of mass yield for ""the now""."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,5,Sun May 24 23:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy to spend millions or billions on environmental stewardship, but here's the part that worries me:   In a 2008 letter, chief health officers for B.C., Vancouver Island and the Victoria region asserted that if Victoria really wanted to clean up the local environment, it should spend its millions on almost literally anything else.   I want that money to have maximum efficacy, and when we have relevant professionals saying the money would be better environmentally spent on ""literally anything else"" that sets off alarm bells for me."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,Nimnio,-3,Mon May 25 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is worrisome. But are they talking about cleaning up our sewage in general, or this specific project. If read one way it could mean this specific proposal is stupid, or it could mean this whole idea that our sewage has that much of an impact is stupid.  Maybe this project/proposal (whatever you want to call it since it hasn't actually started) would cost way too much money. It is like 700m for it. My argument was never what has been going on be the best choice, I'd put money on the idea that there is a cheaper option that would work. It was that cashewbutts said there is no environmental problem with doing what we do now. I was arguing the fact that what we do now has an environmental impact. The article said itself that there was, and cashewbutts denies it. It may not be 700m worth of a problem, but its still a problem. Arguing that it's not a problem is like arguing climate change isn't real.  Victoria is known from outsiders for its practice of dumping raw sewage into the ocean. It's the one thing I knew about it before moving here. On a less serious note I bragged about the beaches to people back home, and get the reply ""at least our beaches aren't filled with shit."" On top of viewing it as an environmental impact, look at what it does for the islands image. Who wants to come to a city that has an ""outdated"" way of dealing with sewage, that has an environmental impact.   Now, as someone who doesn't actually know, what does a chief health officer have to do with our environmental impacts? Is part of their job to help protect the environment or are they just for public health?"
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,10,Mon May 25 02:53:02 2015 UTC,And there's the emotional response I was referring to.   Research it yourself. Hit google or Go ahead and phone uvic's earth science professors and ask them how tidal flushing takes it all to the ocean and sea life in the strait is healthy. Here is a list of faculty with contact Info:  http://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/people/faculty/index.php
VictoriaBC,370ot6,cashewbutts,-1,Sun May 24 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"well sealife in the strait is any thing but healthy. but your right Victoria's crap is just one of many crap producers in the ocean.  the crap outlet pipes makes for some great commercial crabbing grounds too. locals wont set the traps there, and the commys come in and use the chummed waters. off to china it goes!"
VictoriaBC,370ot6,TunguskaEventHorizon,-14,Sun May 24 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"That is not an ""emotional response."" You lack any actual evidence to back up your claim that it has no negative effects and is perfectly fine. That is someone arguing your lack of evidence.   Just because we don't deal with it, doesn't mean its not affecting the ocean negatively, and you know that. Pumping toxic chemicals (aka cleaning products) into the ocean is harmful.  Unless you can prove otherwise, I'm taking whatever you have to say with a grain of salt."
VictoriaBC,370ot6,james121345,7,Sun May 24 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"i'm not the first person to make the argument that we don't need sewage treatment in victoria. it has been studied extensively by professional scientists for over 50 years. i have a masters degree in ocean science. the evidence is out there -- i have actually spent years of my life researching it. you have not. go find the evidence yourself, it's not my job to educate you."

VictoriaBC,36ynl3,Lord_Rat,14,Sat May 23 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"There's also the Shelbourne Street time warp where if you're driving along Shelbourne south of Hillside Mall in October between 2 and 3 am the road may transform into an unpaved, overgrown country road with farms and fields surrounding it.   I actually experienced this. I used to live in Fernwood and often walked between my home and the library at UVic. I was walking home down Shelbourne on the same route I'd taken to the university just hours earlier when the sidewalk abruptly ended and I found myself walking on an unpaved path as it curved around a large tree. That's odd. I stopped to have a look because I assumed they were repairing the sidewalk. But as I'd just walked north along the same route that evening I thought it was a strange time to begin repairs. And no signs warning pedestrians.   It was really dark and the rain was ridiculous, but there were houses much larger than I'd remembered and the properties were quite bigger than I'd remembered. The houses were set far back and far apart from one another. It made a big impression on me -- but only that I had never noticed this small upscale section of Shelbourne, having walked this route so often in the past -- but I continued walking home in the rain and soon the path ended and it was sidewalk again.   Just a week or two later it was nearing Halloween. Monday Magazine used to have an article every year talking about various spooky legends of Victoria in its Halloween issue. That's when I read about the Shelbourne Street ""time warp."""

When I was very young I remember two buildings connected by an elevated walkway and a tunnel but I think there was some sort of open square that even then blocked part of Broad.  Burnside is an interesting one.  I think it counts for this discussion because for no obvious reason it takes a 90 degree turn at an intersection. The section from Tillicum Mall that goes under the highway and then turns left up the hill is ""new"".  Originally Burnside went up the highway off ramp but I believe when they built that part of the TCH they realigned Burnside to avoid the need for an intersection there.  Bonus random fact: Ever wonder why McKenzie suddenly turns into Admirals?  McKenzie used to end near Carey Road.  I forget where Admirals ended but the area between them was houses and trees.  At some point in the early-to-mid 80's they pushed McKenzie through to create a better connection between Pat Bay Highway and TCH.  Back then the intersection of McKenzie and PBH was a 4-way with lights and McKenzie had a bit of a hill to climb up to the elevation of the highway... the interchange was built prior to the Commonwealth Games, I think."

VictoriaBC,36w634,derekja,0,Fri May 22 17:10:56 2015 UTC,Most of Monsanto's 'evils' are based on their legal actions. Either lawsuits or legal loopholes they abuse.

VictoriaBC,36w634,RumSeer,5,Sat May 23 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"Most, if not all, of those legal actions were perfectly justifiable. Monsanto doesn't go around suing farmers willy-nilly. What loopholes are you referring to?"
VictoriaBC,36w634,OutSane,4,Fri May 22 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to be really honest and state my information might be outdated and I haven't bothered to back check it's status. But a while back Monsanto was (apparently)  laying down lawsuits for cross pollination (ie: farmers who ended up with Monsanto GMO crops by simply being next door to a farm who also planted it, thus having a product they did not pay for).  Now for the record again, I'm gonna admit that I'm haivng a hard time finding much info online 1) because I'm not that invested in the topic and 2) I've had a bit to drink and this is far more effort than I'm willing to put in at this hour.  I've peeked at a few sites against Monsanto in this matter and found a bunch of un-cited (for the most part) statements and I'm not even going to bother linking them due to links to anti-vac bullshit they also spew that throws their complaints into heavy skepticism.  However I'd like to point out that other more qualified folks have managed to pull some links out that are more informative than what I can offer at this point. Also, your only link provided is a direct link to Monsanto's website and I'd hardly consider that unbiased (I mean, of course they would paint themselves favorably, who wouldn't?).  Do I agree this entire protest is silly? Yep.  Do I think Monsanto is completely without 'evil'? Fuck no, not a single multi-billion dollar company hasn't got a few skeletons in their closet.  Patent law in the US is a pretty complicated issue and lawsuits tend to be thrown around quite readily in order for the parent company to 'protect' their patent. (Bethesda games raised a bit of a fuss over Notch/Minecrafts creator making a game called ""Scrolls"" due to similarities with ""The Elder Scrolls"".  So as silly as it might seem, there's been plenty of silliness to go around. Would not surprise me one bit if Monsanto didn't have a few cases that got tossed out."

VictoriaBC,36w634,DownboatGoat,-3,Wed May 27 23:15:38 2015 UTC,Monsanto has done some pretty evil things and is a really shady company.   What have they done in the last twenty years
VictoriaBC,36w634,mmeija,5,Fri May 22 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, according to the Environmental Defense Fund Scorecard (2000), in 1990 Calhoun County, the county where Anniston is located, ranked among the worst 20% of all counties in the United States in terms of an average persons added cancer risk from hazardous air pollution (Table 2). It was not until 1993 that the residents of Anniston got their first glimpse of troubles linked to Monsanto and their PCBs (Beiles, 2000).   http://umich.edu/~snre492/Jones/anniston.htm  For decades, Monsanto, the agrochemical company responsible for manufacturing herbicide and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) found in food, had been contaminating the area with toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.  In 2003, residents successfully sued chemical giant, however, veterans who were based at Fort McClellan were prevented from joining this lawsuit.  http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/09/19/ft-mcclellan-health-act-health-hazards-pcbs/  20 years ago?

PCBs http://www.cbsnews.com/news/toxic-secret-07-11-2002/  2,4-D, 2, 4, 5-T and the dioxin debacle of Nitro, WV...   For about two decades, ending in 1971, a former Monsanto chemical plant in West Virginia produced the herbicide 2,4,5-T which was used in ""Agent Orange"" — the defoliant the military sprayed over Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.   http://www.npr.org/2012/02/01/146144078/monsanto-accused-in-suit-tied-to-agent-orange  I'm sure they're giving us the whole story on glyphosate though.  2, 4-D - an agent orange ingredient, has been approved by the EPA. Oh, and glyphosate. Which is most of RoundUp. But, hey, the 2,4-D probably isn't the bad part of A.O.  http://www2.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/registration-enlist-duo"
VictoriaBC,36w634,mmeija,5,Fri May 22 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know exactly where you're finding these links but I'll take a shot at addressing each of them.   PCBs   Monsanto has been very open about their understanding of PCBs since the 1930s, there was no cover-up. The chemical division of Monsanto which produced PCBs pre-1971 no longer exists, and nobody who worked for them then works for them now. The current Monsanto lost the lawsuit, but solely because they kept the same name despite completely reforming the company. Monsanto certainly wasn't the only company pumping out PCBs either - do you boycott GE? You're also likely using a mobile phone or PC with semi-conductors in it produced by companies which have contaminated the environment to a much greater extent.   DDT   Monsanto receives flak for producing DDT, an insecticide first produced in 1874. While DDT is very effective at preventing malaria by killing mosquitos, we now know that large-scale use of DDT for agricultural pest control poses unacceptable risks. Note that more than a dozen agricultural companies produced DDT leading up to its 1972 ban.   2,4-D etc   “Agent Orange, a defoliant used in the Vietnam War, was made with two herbicides: 2,4-D (the one that the new corn tolerates), and 2,4,5-T. The 2,4,5-T was unknowingly contaminated with a dioxin, something that was only later recognized as a significant human safety issue. Yes, 2,4-D was part of Agent Orange, but it wasn’t what made Agent Orange a danger back in the 1960s.”   Glyphosate   The WHO recently released a report declaring glyphosate is a ""probable carcinogen"". That report has recieved a lot of flak from the scientific community: it didn't use any new data, the monograph has not been published yet (just a press release), and it flies in the face of hundreds of independent studies showing that glyphosate is nontoxic. Even taking all that into account, some ""probable carcinogens"" include coffee, pears, alcohol, and sunlight. Glyphosate is safer to ingest than table salt. Here is an excellent series of links which provide evidence for the safety of glyphosate  Here's the real nail in your coffin though: Monsanto allows any researcher worldwide to experiment on their products, with no contract, and publish the results. Literally anyone anywhere can study Monsanto products with no repercussions or fees."

VictoriaBC,36w634,ninjatune,14,Sat May 23 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"I will be handing out flyers with the following text:  I have concerns about... Roundup/glyphosate  • Roundup formulations (aka glyphosate) are the most widely used herbicide worldwide. It works by inactivating an enzyme which plants use to synthesize required amino acids. Crops, both GMO and non-GMO, have been developed to use a different form of the enzyme and are therefore not affected by glyphosate. Animals and insects do not use the same enzyme, so glyphosate does not harm them or us. Typical usage: 0.01grams/sqft  • Glyphosate has been studied intensely by researchers around the world. Overwhelming evidence shows that the levels of glyphosate which consumers are exposed to are safe.   • Herbicide applicators are exposed to a much higher dose of glyphosate than consumers. At these levels, glyphosate is still safe. In fact, glyphosate is safer to ingest than table salt.  • A recent report by the WHO has declared glyphosate a “probable carcinogen” at those ultra-high doses which farmers are exposed to. Note that coffee, alcohol, pears, sunlight, and insomnia are also classified as carcinogens. Furthermore, this report has been heavily criticized in the academic community for misrepresenting evidence.  I have concerns about... GMO effects on human health  • Every scientific body worldwide agrees that modifying crops through genetic engineering does not inherently pose a greater risk than conventional breeding techniques.  • GMOs are extensively tested before public release. Agricultural scientists spend years trying to develop a crop with ideal characteristics and no negative effects. By contrast, crops developed through conventional methods (eg. mutagenesis) are not tested at all.  • American Medical Association: “There is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods. Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature.”  • Royal Society of Medicine: “Foods derived from GM crops have been consumed by hundreds of millions of people across the world for more than 15 years, with no reported ill effects (or legal cases related to human health), despite many of the consumers coming from that most litigious of countries, the USA.”  I have concerns about... insecticides and herbicides  • Ideally, we wouldn’t have to use pesticides. In practice, it is impossible to feed the world (especially in developing countries) without them unless we all become farmers. On a small-scale, going pesticide-free is a great choice – just like buying local!  • Pesticides increase yield by reducing spoilage. Increased yield means that less farmland needs to be used – which means less habitat destruction and fewer carbon emissions.  • Large-scale organic farms use pesticides (atrazine, metalochlor, pendimethalin, metribuzin, copper sulphate, pyrethrins, etc)  which are significantly more harmful to humans and the environment than synthetic pesticides. These compounds are applied more frequently, at a higher dose, and closer to harvest than modern formulations.  I have concerns about... GMO effects on environments  • Adoption of GMO technology has reduced pesticide use while increasing yield  • Using GMOs has also increased biodiversity for all crops except soy, because modern techniques allow researchers to rapidly develop new strains to combat new problems.  • The use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers needs to be regulated to prevent abuse - but both GMO and non-GMO crops should be addressed with the same regulations.  • Increased yield means less farmland needs to be used, which means less habitat destruction, fewer carbon emissions, and less water consumption  • Pesticide resistance is a serious problem that is best addressed using all the tools we have available – GMOs are an ideal way to slow development of resistance (by stacking traits).  • European Commission: “The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.”  I have concerns about... seed contracts and patents  • Both GMO and non-GMO crops are produced by biotech companies such as Monsanto. Farmers overwhelmingly choose to purchase seeds under contract, because the techniques used to develop modern seeds give much higher yields.  • Interestingly, if you plant a normal, non-GMO apple seed from an apple you buy at the grocery store, it will not grow into the same apple tree. Because of a rather complex process, the seeds from most crops cannot be harvested and re-planted. To learn more about why this is, have a look at the Wikipedia page on F1 hybrids.  I have concerns about... the history of Monsanto  • During the Vietnam war, a chemical manufacturing division of Monsanto was contracted by the US government to produce Agent Orange. The use of chemical weapons is not justified, but the choice to produce and use them was made by the government. That division of Monsanto no longer exists and never had ties to the agriculture division.  • Monsanto also receives flak for producing DDT, an insecticide first produced in 1874. While DDT is very effective at preventing malaria by killing mosquitos, we now know that large-scale use of DDT for agricultural pest control poses unacceptable risks. Note that more than a dozen agricultural companies produced DDT leading up to its 1972 ban.  • Perhaps the most common accusation against Monsanto is that they abuse legal loopholes and strong-arm small farmers. Monsanto only pursues legal action against farmers who have wilfully violated contractual obligations. From court transcripts, it is very clear that people such as Percy Schmeiser and Moe Parr engaged in criminally liable practices.  • Monsanto does not control government regulatory agencies. Laws concerning GMOs are drafted by large panels of legal and scientific authorities, and all policies are subject to intense scrutiny before being instituted. Experts often take both public and private sector jobs in their careers; federal laws take conflicts of interest very seriously. Any accusation of a corrupt public servant needs to be backed up with evidence of wrongdoing.  I have concerns about... tampering with nature  • Did you know that kale, broccoli, kohlrabi, and cabbage are all the same plant? Mankind has been interfering with nature to develop crops which are tastier, larger, and healthier for thousands of years. Corn used to be the size of your thumb, bananas were inedible.  • The crops you know and love were very likely produced by mutagenesis breeding. Farmers douse their seeds in highly toxic chemicals, or radiation, to mutate crops until they end up with a profitable strain. Just like your Shih Tzu used to be a wolf, your fruits and veggies used to look a lot different before man intervened for the better.  • USDA certified organic crops can be mutagenized with chemicals/radiation. Recently, a potato and a zucchini were bred using conventional methods and ended up being toxic.  • Although GMO crops are extensively tested before commercial release, conventionally bred crops are not regulated at all. Farmers can mutate their crops and never test them.  • It might seem scary to borrow genes from a different species – you might have heard of a tomato with fish genes. Currently, there are no GMO crops available with animal genes. However, nature loves to swap genes – human DNA, for instance, has lots of genes from viruses, bacteria, and fungi. All DNA is made of the same 4-letter alphabet, and GMO crops are intelligently designed to only use safe and beneficial genes.  • If you are worried about GMOs contaminating the world and ruining heirloom strains, keep in mind the exact same problem is true for conventionally bred crops.  • The same technologies used to develop GMO crops are used in medicine – most insulin for diabetics is produced by genetically engineered microbes. Modern medicine relies on GMO technology to develop treatments for cancers and other serious illnesses.  I have concerns about... my right to know  • Just like “organic” and “kosher”, there are optional “GMO-free” labels to help you make an informed choice. This way, only people who want to know if their food contains GMOs are paying for labelling the developmental technique used.  • Mandatory labels for GMOs would be very expensive – but not because of the paper label: currently, the same silos and threshers and trucks are used to transport non-GE corn and GE corn alike. Forcing companies to label GMOs would significantly increase food prices, hurting people below the poverty line. Who will pay for these costs?  • Many products from GMO crops are identical to products from naturally bred crops. There is no way to test if beet sugar comes from a GE beet or not – labels could not be verified. Some GMOs do not contain any extra compounds, should they be labelled?  • Because each GMO crop has distinct characteristics, there is no reason to use the same label for all GMOs. GE corn and natural corn are much more similar than GE corn and GE soy, so why would the same label be put on both GE crops?"

They don't try and ""up sell"" you a bunch of stuff but they do give your car a once over and let you know things that might need replace/repair in the coming months. They do it in a way that's not a high pressure way, making you feel like you have to get them to do it right away. They just tell you what's up and give you an idea of what kind of costs you'll be looking at when the time comes. I really appreciate it because then I can plan out and budget for it."

Saying half of the positive reviews on the first 2 pages come from reviewers with only 1 rating isn't really egregious. That still leaves a lot of positive reviews from reputable reviewers.  That's not to say that management isn't posting them, but I would want more proof before I started judging them. Maybe they have asked friends and family to rate them (which I would do as a business owner) which could result in a lot of first time reviewers.

I wanted to take up a job in Richmond while studyi g here at UVicand the ONLY reason that stopped me from even applying was that the ferry would take up close to half of what I'd be payed for a full 8 hour shift. If I had a car, more like 80%.   We should just create our own ferry. With blackjack and hookers."
VictoriaBC,36nik5,james121345,1 point,Wed May 20 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I'm not sure how much ferries cost elsewhere (moved here from Ottawa, where we just get screwed over on most other methods of transit). Question is would people be willing to stomach the bill to build a bridge? I found an article from a few years back that has an estimate of $12billion. It also goes into a bit of detail as to why the bridge would be tricky to pull off.  While there is demand, I just don't think there's enough demand to offset the cost of pretty much any solution (a competing ferry company would cost lots to set up, and I just can't see the profits being alluring enough).   We can keep the blackjack and hookers though right?"
VictoriaBC,36nik5,OutSane,4,Wed May 20 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"We can keep blackjack and hookers.   It could be viable if they just had 1 route, let's say similar to swarts-tswaslabfm (fuck that name)  Ive heard that Having to offset the costs of the other routes drives up the price alot."

I'd prefer the one way on Pandora and Johnston as opposed to the two way on Pandora. Mostly because the traffic currently is one way on Pandora for both bikes and cars, having it so that bikes have two way traffic on a one way road.  I just think that would mess with the 'flow' of traffic and possibly cause confusion among the roads users, and confusion tends to be a bad thing."

Taking money that could be invested in the parking problems and spending it on removing parking lanes to increase bike use is a very risky gamble and the best bet is that retail businesses will continue to flee the city core for properly planned spaces with good parking convenience.

VictoriaBC,36jryr,Brocket-99,0,Thu May 21 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on this. Motivations for going into Iraq both times, are widely acknowledged as being false. We know this. The babies being thrown out of incubators was a lie, as was the yellowcake evidence, and the attempts to link Saddam to Al Qaeda. These wars, along with the sanctions that go along with them, have resulted in over a million deaths, many more American deaths than 9/11, and we can agree without any name calling or emotional rhetoric that these wars were constructed upon falsehoods.   Maybe people should not be so quick to ridicule those who point out holes in the story of 9/11 when we know that the US Gov was totally ok with sending an entire country to hell (look at the state of modern Iraq, on every metric so much worse than pre-invasion, ISIS invading it etc) based on LIES that they KNEW were lies. General Wesley Clark admits the wars were pre-planned.  We also have the declassified Operation Northwoods plans to stage false flags to get us into wars with Cuba. I'm not saying I know for a fact 9-11 was a false flag, but it makes more sense to me than men in caves. Go ahead and downvote, all I'm saying is it is good to keep an open mind and not just ridicule other because what they are saying makes you uncomfortable."

Just because someone isn't doing primary research in the field doesn't mean their findings are without merit.  Literally every single person I've ever spoken with who's done any reasonable amount of reading about the events 9/11, the subsequent cleanup, and the official 9/11 commission report has come to the independent conclusion that certain facets of the official story don't add up. I'm not putting forth any conjectures as to exactly what happened, I doubt there are many still alive that really know, but anyone capable of critical thought and who's willing to entertain a narrative other than what's spoon fed to us by the mainstream media should be able to see there are problems with the official story.   Take building 7 for example. There has literally never been a single case of a steel beamed building collapsing from fire, of which there have been many. There have been buildings that we're literally gutted from top to bottom by fires in developing nations where we can only reasonably assume building codes are demonstrably worse but that didn't collapse, yet building 7 collapses from a single floor catching fire from some ""debris?""   It just doesn't add up."

Like me, I would wager that gexor acknowledges there are still questions to be solved around the 9/11 tragedy, but people like you who assume that unanswered questions equate to evidence of the darkest theories are just as ignorant as those you think you're accusing.

VictoriaBC,36jt09,dustymcmusty,8,Tue May 19 22:21:47 2015 UTC,Wellburns tends to have much lower prices for non-staple items and is great for getting non-perishables where you don't have to worry about who packed it. Their weekly specials are also much better.
VictoriaBC,36jt09,Atys,14,Wed May 20 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think the only people who shop at Wellburns are the people who live close to Wellburns. I know my wife got food poisoning from something she bought there (admittedly that was decades ago). It's pretty grubby.  On average though, a cart of groceries at Wellburns is going to cost less than the same cart at the Market. Cherry picking 4L milk isn't really representative."
VictoriaBC,36jt09,Sasken,5,Tue May 19 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, staples like milk are gonna be priced pretty evenly across the board, since they get the customer in the store. So that's not really what you should be comparing.  I personally shop at both because I live pretty equidistant from both. I think of Wellburns as being cheaper but I've never closely compared receipts. I don't think it's really that grubby, it's not like it's Oxford Foods. I wouldn't necessarily do a big grocery shop there, I go to Walmart or Costco to do that, but it's fine for picking up one or two ingredients on the way home from work. It's good for certain asian foods too."

The issue down at Pandora is definitely the drug use; it's sad and unfortunate that there aren't more resources available to help people who are struggling.

VictoriaBC,36dflt,aboba_,1 point,Tue May 19 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for your feedback. I am not going to move as I like the building and the location. The rent for my large 1bdrm is $680/mth and that includes heat and hot water. That price is unheard of in Victoria. I've moved many times in the past and the rents are all at least $200+ more for the same. Also, moving doesn't resolve my concerns and the expense of moving is something I just cannot afford. My sister has suggested to just continue bringing the bike into my apt. (which is on the main floor beside the back door) and when the building manager tries to threaten me that I should respond with, ""please have the building owners (in Red Deer, AB) contact me to discuss my concerns."

Victoria is a fairly small city with a huge restaurant and bar scene. And lots of students coming into the city to look for those jobs. The market is oversaturated.

VictoriaBC,368plf,slobarnuts,4,Sun May 17 08:10:13 2015 UTC,"The problem with highly skilled labor like IT in Victoria is that employers tend to pay new hires about 15-25% lower than what you can get on the mainland/Vancouver, and uses phrases like ""the nice weather"" to justify paying less. Gov't, while big here, doesn't hire much IT anymore - most of it is outsourced to said companies. About 1/3 of companies that are hiring tech workers are startups which are risky ways to get started in this town (I have two friends who were laid off from such companies in the last year) and they usually have a mile high list of qualifications and demands that TL;DR as ""be able to run the entire company yourself"" while being ""competitively compensated"" with a gym membership and foozball table in the lunchroom that nobody has to time to use. There's little demand for other types of engineers (e.g. Mechanical) too, so that puts supply/demand pressure on the few jobs that are available at places like the shipyards.

If the police locate your bike with a known thief they will scan any number they find. This is how Langford PD returned my dirt jumper 18 months after it was stolen beside hillside mall.  Hopefully you find your bike. Go to any bike shop you can think of with a photo of your bike and if it ever goes in there they will let you know.

Be sure to let second hand bike places such as recyclistas and Bicycleitis know, as typically someone looking for a quick flip would enquire there.  Hope this helps, and good luck!"

VictoriaBC,35ysfv,Risiko19,12,Thu May 14 17:20:27 2015 UTC,This was my first time at a political rally.  I guess it was what I expected.  Lots of people with tunnel vision cheering at the end of every sentence no matter who the speaker.    Mulcair did speak well (wish I could say the same for the two MCs at the start) but I think he misunderstands his voters here.  He attacked the Conservatives for 20 minutes and didn't mention the Liberals or Greens once.  It's the left parties that he's got to compete with out here.  The Conservatives are incredibly unpopular out here.  Edit: That was a bit of a hyberbole about the Liberals.  What I meant was he should have spent more time on the Liberals rather than the Conservatives.
VictoriaBC,35ysfv,littlebirds_,3,Fri May 15 02:50:38 2015 UTC,He mentioned the Liberals (and Trudeau) quite a few times...
VictoriaBC,35ysfv,littlebirds_,2,Fri May 15 08:11:16 2015 UTC,"You got that right. The most I took away from it was how much I'd love for him to read me a book. Such a steady, deep and calm voice.   He said nothing of substance all night, pretty much what we should have anticipated."

VictoriaBC,35ysfv,Squidsonthemoon,2,Fri May 15 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In my mind it's as simple as: ""Harper isn't eco friendly and hates #freedom, Trudeu(However it's spelled) is just shadowing in his last name, and May is a nut, who stands for alot that I agree with, is still a nut"""
VictoriaBC,35ysfv,james121345,0,Fri May 15 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"I have met all 3, May certainly is not a nut, she is a very smart lawyer, likely the most inteligent of the 4 leaders. Mulcair is the most delusional, he has surrounded himself with yes men, who have convinced him he will be PM. One day, and c'mon, that will never happen. Trudeau is young, and has not done enough to distance his ideas from the Conservatives, he is also a poor debater."
VictoriaBC,35ysfv,MrYYJ,4,Fri May 15 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"What would you say about May's views on""wifi signals are dangerous"" with no actual scientific proof to back it up. Her phone she uses puts out WAY more signals than the smart meters she was against. I call that a nut, and don't want anyone with that kind of thought process as a leader. That may only be a small fraction of what she is all about, but that alone, is enough to remove her from who I'd be willing to elect.  Who says he is actually delusional about being PM. It is in my mind that with the success in Alberta, you'd use that to your advantage to try to gain as many votes as possible.  I went to see what Mulcair is all about. Even with the lack of actual substance, I was pretty happy with what was said, being out of campaign. Harper has shown a lack of care for further generations, care for the environment, and the focus on the CPC's can raise alot of support for him. ""Vote for me if you're tired of the BS the CPC's have put forth."" Because even if he doesn't get PM, it could still kick the CPC's and Harper out of government. Which seemed to be the main focus."

You get to attend 3 workshops out of five and there is a casual journal workshop during lunch while people can socialize. Each workshop is co-facilitated by both a youth from the cvyc and a professional for each topic. Meaning that, for example, for the money workshop we have a credit union financial planner working with a youth and for the sexual health workshop we have someone from Island Sexual Health working with a youth.   I've had a few people ask about what the difference is between the nutrition and food sustainability work shops. Nutrition is about learning what is good to eat and food sustainability is about how to get good food, like learning about gardening, farmers markets, urban gardens and basically getting the seed planted in your head that it is good to take care of the community as well as yourself.    It being held at city hall as a way of opening up the public and youth to city hall, whereas before it was kind of closed off to the public.   Here is the events page on the cvyc website: http://cvyc.ca/event/6559/view  Do you have any further questions?"

VictoriaBC,35vbfc,didsomebodysaymeow,5,Thu May 14 01:39:33 2015 UTC,How does this work?  I'm assuming you need some sort of government issued card to gain access?  Or is this not a medicinal thing?
VictoriaBC,35vbfc,GameAddikt,7,Thu May 14 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"It is medicinal, but it's not legal, government-sanctioned medicinal.  The dispensary themselves gives access to its members.  Its members are presumably people who the dispensary deems have demonstrated a medical need for marijuana.  Technically, it's just as illegal as any non-medicinal marijuana selling, but VicPD turns a blind eye because they're not hurting anybody and there's really no public will to see these places shut down/prosecuted."

VictoriaBC,35vbfc,slobarnuts,2,Thu May 14 13:25:40 2015 UTC,"A prescription is your doctor's recommendation of a specific drug in a specific quantity. ""I've seen X for Y years and they have condition Z"" isn't a prescription."
VictoriaBC,35vbfc,dentonite,2,Thu May 14 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"There's a difference.  A prescription the doctor knows the treatment and prescribes an appropriate medication.

As far as I'm aware there is no age restriction on medical marijuana. You just need a prescription. AFAIK there's no provision for recreational use in this case.

I actually (safely) went through a yellow but they couldn't, so I had to pull over at a safe spot and wait for them.  Anyway, it's pretty much just a drive. They make you go on the highway. Remember to turn off your turn signal. Make sure to really emphasize your shoulder checks. A guy I took the course with had a really bad neck so couldn't turn his head much and they failed him on it."
VictoriaBC,35scxz,Tweeeked,16,Wed May 13 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"+1 on dramatic shoulder checks... And reme er to look over your shoulder to the right when making right turns. And if you fail, take it in Duncan... The entire test is in a 30km zone lol"
VictoriaBC,35scxz,just_quit_smoking,13,Wed May 13 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"Make sure that when you move within your lane (i.e. adjusting your lane positioning) you shoulder-check. Going too slow is just as bad as going too fast. Don't worry about whether the ICBC car is following you. They will let you know if you need to pull over and wait for them to stop. If they take you down some obscure side street, it's for a reason. There is likely a school zone, roundabout, or something else that they are looking to see that you are aware of. Don't put your foot down when making the u-turn. They don't expect perfection, so don't sweat making small mistakes."
VictoriaBC,35scxz,Panthen,10,Wed May 13 03:32:01 2015 UTC,"Shoulder check or side-to-side scan a lot.  There's one intersection I lost a point on because the stop sign is set back on a hill, almost too far to see what's coming.  I didn't shoulder check again just before entering the intersection.  I was once told if you have a monochromatic helmet, to put a contrasting piece of tape on the back so that your shoulder checks are obvious.  Wasn't necessary for my yellow/black/white striped helmet.  If there is any particular hazard on the road (kid on bike, pedestrian, etc.) make sure you turn your head towards it and hold for a fraction of a second.  By doing that you're proving that you're aware of hazards around you.  If you get separated from the car and pull over (highly probable it will happen, for me it was at a left turn... I was stopped in the intersection when the light went yellow and had to make the turn) make sure when you see them coming that you enter the road properly.  I goofed by accelerating up to 50 in a school zone.  I nailed the brakes and got down to 30 right away.  After the test, the guy says ""is there anything you had problems with?"".  I owned up to the school zone, he laughed and said ""well you caught your mistake... you pass.""  So I think the lesson there is that if you make a mistake, say so at the end if asked.  Make sure you know the difference between playground (30 km/h dawn to dusk) and school zones (30 km/h 8:00-5:00).  So both are in effect during the road test times.  The two zones often overlap so watch the signs carefully.  You will be taken onto the highway, most likely entering and/or exiting somewhere between Quadra and Royal Oak.  There are several pre-planned routes they can use.  In addition to properly signalling and merging they will want to see you accelerate confidently while merging without excessive weaving/wobbling.  One of the posters mentioned exiting the ICBC parking lot.  There was (may still be) a nasty speed bump right there.  Check it out before hand.  You do not want to blow that stop sign there because you lose control/get distracted by the bump.  Pretty sure that's there for a reason.  One last thing... the test isn't over until you turn the bike off and dismount.  I've heard of people that are so relieved that they let out the clutch while the bike is still running in gear or worse, forget to put the kickstand down.  You lose points for that.  My advice is when you park it at the end, ignore the invigilator, put your feet down, relax, breathe a few times then go through your shut down/dismount  routine.  Before getting off, your bike should be in gear (on an incline it will roll in N).  There's lots there but in general, I found the test very fair.  If you know how to handle yourself in traffic, scan for hazards and appear to be in control of your bike, you should pass easily.  Their goal isn't to fail people by one point, it's to weed out the unprepared/dangerous people and pass the people that are prepared."
VictoriaBC,35scxz,isochromanone,2,Wed May 13 04:16:27 2015 UTC,Excellent information! This will be a very helpful thread.
VictoriaBC,35scxz,Panthen,5,Wed May 13 05:53:59 2015 UTC,"Others covered it,   but I'd add don't freak out if they miss parts of the test.    I was convinced I had done something that was an instant fail when I realized we were heading back without a U-turn.    Nope,  just a warning to watch my speed on mckenzie and a pass.  You'd be well advised to go ride around the tiny side streets near the DMV  so you've got an idea of where they are leading you.    Also,  watch out for the stop sign on the way out of the parking lot,   there's no stop line IIRC  but you have to stop before the sidewalk."
VictoriaBC,35scxz,FredThe12th,3,Wed May 13 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"Because they are in a chase car not next to you it ends up being much easier.  Just be confident. Good lane position, watch your speed, shoulder check, and they make you stop on that funny hill intersection on kiwanis way and cook.  Also don't worry if you stall or something minor like that (it happened to me) just be safe most of all and you should be fine. When I passed I had only been riding 2 months"
VictoriaBC,35scxz,Hurst1,2,Wed May 13 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that stop sign is kind of awkward because I think there's also a speed bump? May have more of an effect on tests with regular cars, though."

VictoriaBC,35scxz,andergat,3,Wed May 13 03:46:49 2015 UTC,"To add to the shoulder check advice: put a piece of reflective or electrical tape on the center back of your helmet, that can help them see your checks more clearly.

Luckily the lady doing my test warned me that I was one poor shoulder check away from a fail so I exaggerated them after that and did fine. Good luck, ride safe!"

VictoriaBC,35scxz,thedoorlocker,3,Wed May 13 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"It went well, I passed! Lots of construction zones to watch out for but they didn't mention it after the test. Just stayed slow and cautious through those.  We went through Mckenzie, Blenkinsop and Cedar Hill areas, at least 2 school zones and 2 playgrounds. Did a U-turn around Mcraes, then out to the highway off Mckenzie. On the way back we went down Quadra and through the smaller neighbourhood roads back to ICBC (those ones with lots of speedbumps and roundabouts).   Overall, not bad at all! The U-turn was the only maneuver I had to do, and unlike quite a few people here I didn't have to stop on the big hill at Kiwanis and Cook St. Did a slightly smaller one.   I stopped before the huge speedbump as you leave ICBC and once again afterwards, and he didn't say anything about it afterwards. I remember my driving instructor saying it's okay to stop twice back in the day when I was doing my Class 5 license.   And YES to everyone emphasizing shoulder checks. I essentially did it twice everytime I turned. Once to change my lane positioning and once again right before I turned. Somehow still missed 1 or 2? I also made sure I scanned every single intersection and generally looked around as I drove down side roads. He said before the test it's okay to drive 40km/hr down the side roads if there's lots of parked cars and things, even though the speed limit is 50km/hr.   Thanks again for the tips everyone!"

If you're like me and you'd rather spend the same time travelling a more circuitous route than travelling in stop-and-go traffic on the most direct route, you could take the back way there.

VictoriaBC,35s54x,alligatorcrocs,13,Wed May 13 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"You're outside the cost range for dental tourism, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your perspective.  Camosun is running a pilot project of cheap dentistry (not their dental hygienists program, but actual dentistry) for teaching purposes as well. It's full currently, and they're not sure they'll have funding for the fall  UBC has a low cost dentistry program (found here: http://www.dentistry.ubc.ca/treatment/how-to-become-a-patient/and pay 40-60% ). It books up well in advance.  There is a BC or Canada fee guide for dentistry, and dentists tend to stick to it for the most part. If you call around, you can probably find a dentist willing to do a 20% discount for new clients or people in need --- you'd be looking at ~400$ at that point.  If you're financial situation is sufficiently dire that you'd rather have teeth removed than spend 400$, you might want to look at r/personalfinance, r/personalfinanceCanada, and r/frugal.

VictoriaBC,35s54x,Ikeren,14,Wed May 13 01:38:36 2015 UTC,"The lack of MSP coverage on dental is nothing short of bewildering to me. Dental health is absolutely a fundamental component of general health and it should be covered as part of our standard health care system. I am lucky to now have coverage through mine and my wife's plans which covers most of my costs but not all. For many years I didn't have any coverage and couldn't afford the high cost things they kept telling me I needed. Avoiding these things led to further issues which eventually necessitated more serious work. Something really needs to be done about this. If it requires increasing MSP premiums, so be it. No reasonable person could suggest that dentistry isn't vital to personal health."

Primarily, it's a matter of money. Being a part of MSP would mean provinces would dictate the rates dentists could charge for their services. It would also require adhering to a host of regulations, none of which make the prospect inviting to dentists."
VictoriaBC,35s54x,wrgrant,3,Wed May 13 05:26:58 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't be given the option to say no. You can't operate as a doctor outside of the MSP system can you? They should just legislate the Dentist profession into the system, its ridiculous the way it is.  That said, I think most cosmetic dentistry should not be covered, just the stuff that is needed for your health medically."
VictoriaBC,35s54x,qryCosmos,2,Wed May 13 12:28:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. Proper dental/oral health is no more or less a contributor to overall well-being than any other genuine medical specialty.   Keep in mind, however, MSP does cover some basic preventative care for school-aged children from low-income families and seniors receiving social assistance. And, of course, if any diagnostic, surgical, or emergency dental care requiring hospitalization is needed, this is covered by MSP regardless of age or income.  For most of us, though, we're stuck with the status quo. Dentists and dental hygienists have a well-funded lobby (there are few poor dentists). Furthermore, the political will to press the issue is generally thwarted by the need, if implemented, to raise MSP premiums, which tends to get everyone's knickers in a twist despite the seemingly obvious long-term benefits. Couple that with the fact that many employers provide group dental coverage as part of compensation packages, and you're left with a lack of will at the top (politicians) and little pressure from the bottom (the electorate) to make it happen."

You could sign up for a course at UVic (online if need be) and get dental insurance through the university. Costs around $140 for the year, coverage is 70-90% (depending on which dentist you choose) and covers up to $850/year.

VictoriaBC,35rwyl,thejunt,1 point,Wed May 13 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"I prefer eating real food, like bread made with 4 ingredients, flour, salt, yeast and water. As soon as you want to have the ability to transfer it cheaply to a grocery store for sale and for it to live one someones counter in a plastic bag for days you end up needing a lot of additives and preservatives. I'm a small business owner in Vic and I decided not to use portofino despite the convenience and preferable look of the product because they're sourdough contained an ingredient to make the bread taste 'sour' which is the same ingredient that potato chip companies use (not necessarily an issue with this ingredient, but I didn't come to a sour loaf for the sourness, I came for the health benefits of natural enzymes) and another ingredient azodicarbonamide which is used as a preservative but is banned in the EU and Australia for being a respiratory irritant (connected to asthma) but is apparently a-ok here. No thanks. So my bread is a little firmer the next day, and goes moldy after 3-4, I'll learn to get by."

Then no one wants to be the guy sticking their neck out for those ""Family killing drunk drivers"" even though the legal limit has gotten so low a single beer will earn you a dui, and breathalyzer machine they install in people's cars works terribly and ruins the wiring in your car, I've known a few people who had them, they can't even make it to work in the morning because the shit wiring will kill your battery in 4 hours.   I don't drunk drive personally, but these are the punishments I risk every time I try and have a single beer with dinner as a grown man. But nobody will ever be willing to say ""Maybe this has gone too far"""
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Colonel_Green,4,Tue May 12 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"I don't drunk drive personally, but these are the punishments I risk every time I try and have a single beer with dinner as a grown man.   You'd have to be about 50lbs to blow over .05 after a single beer."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Colonel_Green,2,Tue May 12 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"I was always told 2 beers is about .08, so I guesstimate a 20 ounce pint is about 0.05"
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Colonel_Green,3,Tue May 12 21:26:21 2015 UTC,One 20 oz pint (which very few pubs in Victoria actually serve) consumed on an empty stomach would give 185lb man a peak BAC of 0.032 about 20 minutes after consumption. Check for yourself
VictoriaBC,35pe25,spacepilotblastoff,2,Tue May 12 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"That's my body weight exactly actually, looks like I'm ordering a second beer from now on.   Thanks for the actual source, so many people seem to maintain that it's two beers (and small ones too)."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,PM_Poutine,2,Tue May 12 21:52:58 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.   Elimination rate is where it gets tricky, it can vary from .013 to .018 per hour for an adult male. You'd be amazed how many people party til 3am and then get busted for driving drunk (unknowingly) at 7am the next morning."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Colonel_Green,2,Tue May 12 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm of that school of thought that believes impaired driving should still come with harsh penalties, just not as harsh as the penalties for someone who is willfully endangering others."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,busstopbusstop,2,Tue May 12 14:43:41 2015 UTC,Impaired driving isn't willfully endangering others?
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Risiko19,2,Wed May 13 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the threshold for what constitutes ""impaired driving"" has gotten dangerously low.   And the punishments are pretty solid, that breathalyzer that wrecks your car's electrics is in for a year I think, and costs an extra $1500 for the year. Car is seized and impounded for 30 days, and you have to pay lot fees to get it back (normally over $1000), the actual DUI itself is also over $1000, there's also a license reinstatement fee of about $300.  There's more stuff I'm missing, this is just what I've been told and read, but by the time you've paid for the lawyer, your average DUI costs a person about $10,000 + a ruined car (the way they connect the wires is amateurish, looks like it was wired by a pissed off 14 year old).   Even the leader of MADD left the organization because she thought it had gone too far."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,skeletonwar,8,Tue May 12 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"The threhold for ""impaired"" is the same as it has been for 50 years, 0.08.   There is a separate, lower threshold of 0.05 now, but it comes with correspondingly lower penalties, starting with a 3-day prohibition  and escalating to 7 and the 30-days for repeat offenders, with no mandatory impoundment. You'd need to get three such minor sanctions within a 5 year period to warrant an interlock requirement.   The monetary penalties (and 30-day impoundment) you've described are those of a 90-day Immediate Roadside Prohibtion, which requires a reading of 0.08, just like a criminal charge always has."
VictoriaBC,35pe25,Risiko19,1 point,Tue May 12 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"You don't get interlock for just once incident.... You have to be a repeat offender (unless you were convicted criminally... Which can be a different story) and most people don't get criminal charges,  just immediate roadside prohibitions (IRP)"
VictoriaBC,35pe25,dicer,4,Tue May 12 22:59:53 2015 UTC,I graduated with Randy and played soccer with him growing up.  He was always nice to me but can't say I'm too surprised by all this.

There's the Rooftop Surfclub if you want some drinks and want to watch/play outdoor beach volleyball; The Sticky Wicket if you just want to have a beer a bite to eat; The Clubhouse, which during the day is just part of the restaurant and at night turns into a bit of a dance party; Distrikt which is underground, and more of your EDM type of club; The Games room, which is exactly what it sounds like; and Big Bad John's which is more of your classic dive bar (are there still bra's hanging from the ceiling?).  Failing that just head down to Bastion Square and go to Upstairs (club) or Darcy's (bar, with a decent house band)."

VictoriaBC,35qtkj,skeletonwar,2,Tue May 12 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"Touch is now called ""DéjàVous"" ... I also consider it to be the place where all the 19 year olds (maybe secretly younger) go to grind up on one another.  Is ""Blackout"" what they call Sunday Buckets now?"

VictoriaBC,35q4ky,staticred,6,Tue May 12 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on what age your child is. I just spent 5 months looking for care for my 16 month old daughter. Infant care is difficult to find. There seems to be more options for 2.5 years and up. Worst case, check out Kids and Company at Uptown. It's expensive but it's quality care with lots of flexible options and no waitlists.   You should also consider contacting the Childcare Resource and Referral Centre and joining the FB group Childcare in Greater Victoria.   http://www.childcarevictoria.org"
VictoriaBC,35q4ky,CBMcL,1 point,Tue May 12 18:52:53 2015 UTC,Thanks - we'll most likely be looking for 2-2.5 by the time we get out there.
VictoriaBC,35q4ky,seanboddity,3,Tue May 12 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I am father to two kids, both currently in care.  We're currently looking for new care because our current provider is closing up, so I'm currently in the middle of this in a serious way.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  You have a few options for care:   A ""professional""/corporate facility (Kids and Co., et al) A ""licensed"" facility (up to 7 kids, inspected, registered) A ""license not required"" (LNR) or registered LNR (RLNR) (Two kids or one sibling group) An unlicensed care provider (can be almost anything.  This isn't all that scary - we did this for two years, but you're on your own in terms in inspections and stuff.)   Some thoughts, in no particular order:   As someone mentioned, Kids and Co. at Uptown (also Langford) is an option if you're stuck, but it's about twice as expensive as other solutions out there.  No waiting lists, usually. Used Victoria and Kijiji both have fairly active childcare boards.  You'll need to stay on top of it, though, as spots fill up within a couple of days of posting. There are tons of LNR/RLNR options.  They turn over pretty quickly, there's usually a selection open at any given time, and there's usually some geographic variety. You'll have an easier time for spots 2.5 years (or 3?) and older due to... something to do with licensing. Licensed/corporate places usually do more ""programming"", LNR places are usually more cozy/walks and time outdoors. The Child Care Resource center I find to be totally useless.  Out of date information. If a nanny is an option, join CanadianNanny.ca.  There are dozens of options in Victoria.  All seem to be reasonably well trained.  Seriously, it's a buyers market on there. Some of the smaller corporate places seem to run waitlists in the 6 month range, but not all of them do. Generally there seem to be more openings in Westshore than in Saanich/Victoria.   Good luck!"

VictoriaBC,35oadp,Tal-IGN,2,Tue May 12 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Well a reason may be that the aftermath of this embarrassing moment has largely been about her suitability to be the national leader of a political party, rather than whether she is suitable to be an MP.  I don't think I've seen her riding mentioned once in national coverage.  This story really matters at a national level, not a local one.  You could argue there's two different Elizabeth Mays: there's the MP for Saanich-Gulf Islands and then there's the Green Party Leader. The things that she says/does in her capacity as Green Party Leader may not be particularly important to her constituents who only care about the local MP stuff she gets up to.  But we'll see in a couple months how concerned the people of Saanich are with her behaviour.  Will be an interesting election locally for sure."

All we know is it's registered as a Toyota corolla, the last generation one to be rear wheel drive actually. It's shaping up to be a solid drift vehicle already.   A quick google shows it's a common choice for drifters, and a good platform to build on. There's a shitton of videos and build articles for this very platform.   And drifters don't usually put money into bodywork because it gets beat up anyways, you'll find drift cars with well over $10,000+ in modifications and upgrades not looking much better."

If you beat someone down that is about to use deadly force you're a hero, but if you beat someone down that you think was about to use deadly force and turned out to be doing nothing of the sort, you're a villain.    While this particular case isn't necessarily so close to the line, consideration needs to be made for the unique nature of law enforcement.  Sadly it isn't as black and white as civilian action."

I have many friends who are police, who know who the more violent officers are.  For example, if video evidence provides that you as police lied, or that you weren't in the face of deadly force, you should not be rewarded with further employment as you are now, or placing us as taxpayers on the hook for the trial for your abusiveness.  I fully recognize the incredibly dangerous role policing is, but if police don't move to stopping the abuse, there will be a revolution in time and it won't be pretty. I'd like to know a world where most of my peers don't consider police the biggest risk to their safety, while simultaneously being their biggest protectors. I would prefer it just be the latter."

VictoriaBC,35dlo6,Brocket-99,5,Sat May 9 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, he seems to love the attention."
VictoriaBC,35dlo6,teamleda,4,Sat May 9 14:38:48 2015 UTC,"From his facebook posts, it seems they wrongly seized his Lamborghini under civil forfeiture laws. Then dicked him around to get it back because they ""Wanted to search it for secret compartments"". This was his first day to finally get it back.   They also wrongly charged him for gun charges, all of which were later dropped.  I can see why the guy feels persecuted, he may drive like a dickhead but it seems like he's being fucked around often by the police for random things that don't even stick.   I think the police might be bitter the motorcycle case didn't go their way, I have the same traffic lawyer and he was flabbergasted at the dangerous precedent they wanted to set by selling his motorcycle, over only a speeding ticket (all the other charges were dropped), they also aggressively tried to coax him into signing something that would allow them to sell it and he'd get something like 10% of the sale proceeds. If he didn't sign, he was threatened with additional charges, and a bunch of other fines by the police. All of that bullshit got thrown out, he got his bike back, and only got an excessive speeding ticket because that was the only thing he was guilty of."
VictoriaBC,35dlo6,Brocket-99,17,Sat May 9 14:59:33 2015 UTC,"to be honest he's asking for it, i don't have much sympathy for him."

VictoriaBC,35dlo6,Brocket-99,12,Sat May 9 15:30:33 2015 UTC,I knew before they releashed his name that it was Randy Scott and a quick look at his fb page last night confirmed that.. Ya but if you read his facebook posts further back they also seized his firearm that he kept in said car when he was at the peelers then later gave it back.. This is a douche bag who not only thinks is hard done by but carries a firearm in plain sight in his vehicle and brags about it ..ya ok.. Personally he is just asking for it...When he becomes known again for something he goes into hiding on facebook.. Did this last time as well.
VictoriaBC,35dlo6,MrYYJ,2,Sat May 9 16:55:31 2015 UTC,Why would anyone need a firearm in Victoria?  Can't he just hire a big guy for security?

VictoriaBC,35emqj,teamleda,-6,Sun May 10 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"NEVER buy via a private sale.    Sure, sell private but never private. Buying private adds nothing but risk."
VictoriaBC,35emqj,meat_mate,1 point,Sat May 9 23:24:12 2015 UTC,In theory you can a get a better price in a private sale. That money the realtors make doesn't just magically come out of nowhere. If you know that the seller is not going to have to give a cut to any realtors then they are in a position to sell for less and you may be able to negotiate a better price.
VictoriaBC,35emqj,barfoob,2,Sun May 10 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"In theory but not really. What happens is the private seller expects to pocket the money savings b/c the seller pays for the realtor not the buyer.  Buying a private sale benefits the buyer very little and adds a substantial amount of risk. Disclaimer: I'm not a realtor - I'm a huge housing bear I think buying a house right now is likely pretty stupid, private sale or not."
VictoriaBC,35emqj,meat_mate,-13,Sun May 10 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Working with a REALTOR® is the best way to evaluate as many options as possible. As a Buyer, it costs you nothing because the Seller carries the burden of offering a commission to the Buyer's agent.   The VREB MLS® system is the best way to find your next property.

He was gunning it up the mountain and you could hear his car from a mile away. It's a miracle that he didn't hit another car or someone walking along the sidewalk. He was up and walking after the crash, but was limping and looked very wobbly on his feet. At the time he just looked shaken up from the crash but maybe the alcohol had a part in that.

They are also usually very friendly and won't pressure you into buying anything. Though I would avoid the chubby girl that works weekends as she can be very abrasive and rude to a lot of customers and then talks ahit about them when they leave. Also don't listen to what the half Asian guy says as he doesn't really know to much about vaping and I have found that he talks out his ass a lot and gives a lot of  misinformation. Everyone else there though are really nice and good people who know what they are talking about.  Simmatech is my next favourite as they generally have a little better juice selection but their prices are generally more expensive. Also if you have any serious questions about vaping try to talk to the owner (9 times out of 10 he is there) as he really knows his stuff.  CES downtown should be avoided at all possibilties, the people that work there don't seem to know very much and I find there juice to be very lacking compared to other stores."

Do know that we're looking for your bike and our officers will do their best to find it.  For anyone else reading this post, I cannot recommend enough that you stop Redditing for a moment, and go take a few photos of your bike, and record your serial number.

VictoriaBC,355igp,nrtphotos,2,Thu May 7 13:56:43 2015 UTC,I'm sure they're well aware of the long list of groups that would fill any available time slot possible. They'd be throwing money out the window if they didn't reserve a few days a month for club rentals.

I ride at western every Tuesday and although it's great to have a track in Victoria,  it just isn't capable of being a decent road race track - no matter how hard we try. People will pay a premium to not take a ferry to go to a trackday. If I want to take my track bike down to the ridge that's a 600 dollar minimum weekend. Even if track fees end up in the 300+ dollar range for the cowichan circuit they will have demand. (Track fees for supermoto at western are 30 dollars, track fees at the ridge are ~200)"

VictoriaBC,355igp,nrtphotos,3,Fri May 8 01:32:43 2015 UTC,"We have a gift of a track in Victoria being western speedway not to mention an anomaly where track charges are concerned. (Victoria Supermoto charges 15 for members and 30 for drop in people and an extra 10 bucks on race nights. We make no money at this and depend heavily on sponsorship. Looking at other clubs we are less then 1/4 of what they charge.) No they don't charge an arm and a leg to use it but they do a top job keeping it going If they charged more then we would not be able to make it work. To do a track day off island as Jeff505 stated is a minimum of $600 usually closer to $1000. A lot of people have at a minimum have $5000 invested in their vehicle to complain about track fees well is strange. The Auto cross, Drifting and other groups could easily step up and pay to play. you have to remember its dependent on how you are charged IE is it one flat fee for track rental say 500 bucks for a day meaning more people out cheaper it gets for everyone or is it a per person thing."

It has slightly cheaper food but for the most part it matches Walmart inventory pretty well and the produce and meat lacks the quality of many of the smaller chains like Thrifty's. If I'm going all the way out to Langford it has to be for Costco.
VictoriaBC,352fbp,jordoonearth,1 point,Thu May 7 21:51:59 2015 UTC,I guess it just depends on what your typical grocery lists consist of. I buy a lot of baby products which are significantly cheaper at superstore then Walmart. Usually I do a costco and superstore run together stockpiling household items and non perishable/frozen food. I also really like the PC brand quality is pretty good for the price .  I shop at thriftys/save on for meat and produce as I live across from thriftys so I just buy what I need every day or so.

Canadian Tire has stores in Ontario (including a tiny 50k pop place called Timmins), that would still be a little larger than the space they'll be getting at Hillside. Some stores even carry groceries, which is a bit of a weird concept.  It would be nice to see a full-sized Canadian Tire open up here on the island. Can't wait to see what they do with the location."
VictoriaBC,352fbp,Iamonabike,11,Wed May 6 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with Western Canada vs Eastern Canada. It's simply old stores vs new stores, no matter where they are. One of the largest Canadian Tire locations in Canada, is in Nanaimo. It's 132,000 Square feet. Because it's among the new breed of Canadian Tire stores. I think there's a 145,000 square foot one being built in Edmonton. The old Canadian Tire stores that were built around 30 years ago are more like 50,000 square feet. All the Canadian Tire stores that have been built in the past 10 years are usually over 100,000 square feet.  Source: I'm a commercial real estate investor"
VictoriaBC,352fbp,shloppypop,2,Wed May 6 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, closer to 20,000 square feet for the old stores. Off the top of my head, the existing Shelbourne Street store is about 12,000, Douglas St about 22,000, Royal Oak around 20,000 and View Royal about 40,000. Colwood was about the same as View Royal when it opened but I think with the expansion it's closer to 60,000 sq feet now. When the BC stores were built they were built using a small store/central warehouse model, so they differ a bit in design/organization from the older stores out East  40,000 square feet is probably still a pretty typical size for a new ""B"" build. It's the ""A"" builds which have jumped significantly in size. They used to be 60,000 sq feet, now they're getting up to 140,000 (Edmonton, Sudburry - Nanaimo is close, I didn't realize it was THAT big)."
VictoriaBC,352fbp,jockstewart,10,Wed May 6 17:38:44 2015 UTC,They'll probably put a Marks in there as well. That's what they seem to be doing with all the new stores.

VictoriaBC,352fbp,GameAddikt,-6,Wed May 6 17:45:17 2015 UTC,That's a shame.  I was hoping the store could be turned into the base of a 500 ft statue of Osama bin Laden.
VictoriaBC,352fbp,james121345,-6,Fri May 8 20:31:15 2015 UTC,Just what Victoria needs - another Crappy Tire store for me to never set foot in. The disgrace of Canadian retailing.

VictoriaBC,352fbp,james121345,3,Thu May 7 03:12:14 2015 UTC,And let it go out of business again. Zellers couldn't keep up with the times (or walmart/futureshop/bestbuy/superstore/mom & pop stores)
VictoriaBC,352fbp,GameAddikt,3,Wed May 6 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"Sad to say it but online shopping is killing the physical stores.  It's just so convenient and cheap.  I went into Bolen's Books to buy a book and I found it for 20 dollars cheaper on Amazon with free next day shipping.  That's hard to compete with, and as much as I love Bolen's books and really want to support them and keep them in business I don't have the money to shell out an extra 10 - 20 dollars every time I want to buy a book, plus gas, and/or the time it takes for me to get to and from the store when I could just order it online and continue going about my business.  It depresses the shit out of me because I know in a couple years the only physical stores left will be clothing stores and the odd specialized and niche stores, and there will be a lot fewer jobs, but what can you do?  Should we cough up the extra money, time and inconvenience to keep these stores alive or will they just go out of business or convert to online and fire most of their staff?  I don't know how to fix it, but it's a huge problem that there's really no easy solution to."
VictoriaBC,352fbp,james121345,1 point,Wed May 6 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"Either way I still have the same job.  Convert to a warehouse worker. If it kills off all physical stores, you're gunna need more workers than they have now because of demand. Not the same, but still. Physical stores aren't good business models anymore, and I want them gone. If your profit is removed by paying your employees a living wage, you shouldn't be in business. If you don't pay your employees a living wage because you're greedy as shit (walmart) then I won't support you when you go under (my current place of work). If you can't put stock on the shelves (target) i wont shop there.  And it's still gunna be more than a couple years till most physical stores leave. Not everyone thinks online is more convenient, or cheaper. Until the baby boomers die off, not much will change in a drastic way."

Now is that conducive to them being nice or not?  Giving those people something highly positive to do (helping others) is going to make them much happier. So that makes for attendants that won't be as ""rough"" as they are getting paid more than a minimum wage and get to do something positive. As well we get help for tourists which just makes the city a better place and encourages more people to come back.  I would not be surprised if this model has been done elsewhere with great success."
VictoriaBC,3528ke,Holypapalsmear,1 point,Sat May 9 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"So we now have a Union taking over parking enforcement?? You cant put lipstick on a pig and call it a star good to see the mayor trying but again a bit short sited I wonder who owns this new company and how much they contributed to her campaign I kid.. I kid.. sort of. IMO. The job has always been one of constant stress for the people giving tickets. They have to put up with a lot of shit not saying that its not deserved at times but remember we do have some self important people in this city that don't think the law applies to them and promptly loose all control of their bowel at the slightest bit of confrontation making a world class issue out of next to nothing.  So going by how other unions happen to go I see lots of stress leave, confrontations, complaints and this all being overhauled when it all shits the bed costing the residents of Victoria more money. The current ""parking Nazis"" as people seem to call them are made up by mostly ex military people and have training on how to deal with doing a shitty job. We have Lots and Lots of other things that need to be worked on in this city other then parking enforcement. Crime, business vacancy, drug problems, homeless and so on. Not millions on more bike lanes, studies on shutting down Douglass to cars and so on."
VictoriaBC,3528ke,onemorepost,3,Sat May 9 05:11:16 2015 UTC,"Leading up to the election the issue of trying to (re)attract people downtown was a big theme, especially for downtown businesses.  Parking enforcement was seen as one of the (many) reasons people stopped coming downtown.  As a councillor Helps was always very responsive on Facebook and so on responding to parking complaints. It was no surprise when the Commissionaires lost the contract.  It's also a strange organization and difficult to work with, playing hardball. I think a lot of people at Victoria were sick of being associated with the Commissionaires brand.  My only question is how much of the $12M revenue will be eaten up by additional staff expenses.   And will staff still be able to collect $12M a year?  Could be quite a hit on city revenue."
VictoriaBC,3528ke,MrYYJ,1 point,Sat May 9 06:38:48 2015 UTC,"I see it as a band aid move by Helps parking enforcement is not a pleasant job. Your getting shit on by the city to bring in the Maximum calculated revenue,(when the city went to the current meters the money brought in was something like 70% more then when the previous meters where in use then the parking fees went up to bring in even more money) You get shit on by people because you enforce the city's parking laws because if you do not bring in the expected revenue you will be out of a job. No matter who does the job they will be the bad people. Now we have a union in that will be expected to do the same job. So instead of fixing the problem she just re branded it. The issue of people paying for an hour of parking and using an hour and 20 mins then getting mad for getting a parking ticket will not be going away. We will still have to deal with that issue not just put lipstick on a pig and call it an election promise filled."
VictoriaBC,3528ke,onemorepost,0,Fri May 8 18:46:52 2015 UTC,If you thought things were bad before just wait until we have unionized parking enforcement.

VictoriaBC,3527wy,Crabinmyshoenow,13,Wed May 6 15:24:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. I also think a heavy tax on unoccupied units would ease the tight rental market and bring some life to those 1/2 empty condo buildings all over the lower mainland.

Buying into this inflated market makes me sick and I certainly don't expect to make money on my house as the generations before me have but if there is a hard crash it would pretty quickly destroy so many peoples lives in an instant, my own included. I feel like buying property here is like a game of financial chicken - i was comfortable waiting and renting but at some point i would like the option to paint my walls, select my own kitchen fixtures and fill the useless back lawn with garden boxes and a greenhouse. In the long run I think foreign investment hinders most Canadians more than it helps so I would support some type of mechanism that puts locals first - the idea of a tax on foreign ownership sits well with me Empty rental properties, exorbitantly high rents and homeless or nearly homeless Canadians does not sit well with me."

VictoriaBC,350clo,GrumpaDirt,3,Sat May 9 14:04:05 2015 UTC,I used to live on Cadillac Ave and walked to 711 frequently. That stretch of road was long overdue for upgrading. Only one side of the street has a sidewalk. The other side from Cadillac all the way to Carey is dirt and is very pedestrian unfriendly. I'm glad they are working on it now. It's a nice area to live in.
VictoriaBC,350clo,ehManiacal,1 point,Wed May 6 06:11:06 2015 UTC,I agree. that part of the road could use a sidewalk and perhaps make that 1/2 merge lane into something better.

VictoriaBC,34z956,wildweeds,10,Tue May 5 23:03:37 2015 UTC,"I did some work for a recycling company. For a brief period of time they had a contract with another waste management firm to do ""recovery"". Essentially they would pass on whatever they believe to be returnable containers to us for sorting, with any non-returnable items going back to them. At this point the items had been compacted to a degree. It became apparent at the very start that exactly what you described would be an issue. Bottles would come through, compacted and punctured, full of needles poking out. Needless to say, this program didn't continue. What I'm saying is that just because it's been tossed in the garbage, doesn't mean it isn't going to come into human contact. And a thin plastic bottle is far from puncture proof."
VictoriaBC,34z956,FredThe12th,0,Tue May 5 23:18:18 2015 UTC,Thanks. So what would you advise a person to do if they found a needle in a schoolyard where children are likely to play before a city official is likely to turn up?

I can't even begin to tell you how many times I have been there and the person who arrived after you tries to go before you and yells at you or how confused people are by it.. The right hand turn going down towards the bottle depot is set to far back and even with turn signals on it confuses people either across from you who just go to the intersection.

VictoriaBC,34ubxx,stevo911_,7,Mon May 4 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer would probably be Salt Spring. It's the easiest and quickest to get to from Victoria (especially by bike), has some great hikes with awesome views; the Saturday farmers market will be crazy as per usual; the brewery is pretty great and has a tasting room; and Ruckle Provincial Park has park-and-walk-in tent sites that are right on the ocean.  If you don't mind a drive and are looking for somewhere with mountain bike trails, and a pretty cool laid back atmosphere, I would check out Hornby Island. You have to drive out to Buckley Bay (about an hour north of Nanaimo), and then take 2 ferries (you only pay 1 way) to Denman Island, and then to Hornby Island. Tribune Bay Provincial Park is the largest and most popular spot for camping on that island.   My other suggestions would be Port Renfrew if you want to be on the west coast, or Cowichan Lake has some pretty nice forestry campsites just outside Youbou."

VictoriaBC,34q4p8,danredux,-8,Sun May 3 17:18:45 2015 UTC,"The government should just let him be the landmark he wants to be. He only lashed out because people tried to take his property and he doesn't respect the government's claim of ownership of all things. I mean, it's kind of ironic for the government to deny his claim of ownership because of a little violence, after everything the government has done to claim and steal this land from its previous owners.  They'll put a ring around the tree, and he won't come down for months. He'll become an attraction. He'll be able to get his message across, but he'll appear silly enough that people will ridicule his message. This works in favor of the government, as he's lowering the chance people will think critically about the government's actual power, where it comes from, where the lines are drawn, and when they are overstepping.  I want him let alone in that tree. Unfortunately, the police will always prod him, to get him to lash out. When he lashes out, he hurts his message. If anything, some support might help- See through the crazy person he's being painted as and go down and support his non-violence attempt to have the government face it's own inhumanity.  Before people claim I'm sitting here on reddit talking out my ass- I spent a month keeping that occupy camp, including Lyle, safe at night, and helped him put up his first encampment."
VictoriaBC,34q4p8,nrtphotos,3,Sun May 3 17:18:43 2015 UTC,so because you wasted your time for a month in that dump you can justify him dumping piss on a city worker? i saw it and i don't think it was justified whatsoever.
VictoriaBC,34q4p8,danredux,-3,Mon May 4 05:08:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't justify his actions, I explained them, and compared them to Canada's history of violent colonialism.  In allowing the government to remove him forcefully from the land, we are accepting the government's ownership of the land, which they themselves stole through violence. However, because he's a slight inconvenience to people walking through the square, we will have him forcefully removed. Though not until the government prods him and makes him defend himself, so as to distract from his possibly-valid protest.  I don't have an opinion about whether his message is right or not, simply that what he does shouldn't nullify what he says. When the government can rely on ad hominem judgment from the public, they will provoke the speaker to hide the message."

VictoriaBC,34q4bj,mimetic-polyalloy,-3,Mon May 4 17:45:28 2015 UTC,Lol..if you want to cherry pick dangerous behaviour we can point to motorcyclists riding up the side of the road t get around traffic or  weaving in and out of cars and trucks like its an obstacle course just because they are small enough that they can. Not to mention the retards who travel inbetween lanes to try and beat traffic. You cant just pick a dangerous behaviour and present it as the norm. Thats utterly ridiculous and you should know that. Like a biker never sped through a school zone.. step into reality and join us.  But if you want to talk rationally I just meant its more dangerous because motorbikes ar small and harder to see. Cant possibly argue with that.

VictoriaBC,34q4bj,nrtphotos,3,Tue May 5 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"what a insane waste of taxpayers money for this circle jerk of police resources. these guys don't shit wear they eat, the aren't stupid. a helicopter all the way from naniamo? really? i'd be willing to bet they love the attention, it's a joke after all. personally i think that will be the safest street in the CRD, it's not going to be like something out of SOA where the clubhouse gets shot up every other day.  my mother shared a duplex with bikers years ago and they were great, they treated her with respect and there were NEVER any problems with them. i'm not trying to say they are great guys, they do make a percentage of their income off drugs and prostitution. but giving them these kind of resources for a drunken biker party is hilarious."
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,Shawn68z,9,Mon May 4 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"not going to be like something out of SOA where the clubhouse gets shot up every other day.

VictoriaBC,34q4bj,Brocket-99,0,Mon May 4 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"It's a good use of resources.  The idea that Indo-Canadian Gangs will take over is inherently racist.  It is true that someone will replace them if they are taken out. But their replacement will be another biker gang - not an Asian gang, and their replacement won't be as powerful and allowed to operate as freely.  The idea that an Indo-Canadian, or Asian gang could set up shop in a somewhat blue collar, and very white-bread town like Victoria is laughable. They'd be ran out of town based on the amount of racism here alone - let alone the fact that they'd stick out on the cops' radar like a sore thumb.  I've seen it before - Asian guys try to set up shop at the Peacock Billiard area - get shut down by the locals every time."
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,nrtphotos,2,Mon May 4 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"dude, how old are you? it's not racist that indo canadian gangs will eventually take a hold of the market. they are simply more ruthless and violent than the older gangs like the HA. look at vancouver, the HA has been pushed around by the asian and indo canadian gangs because of this, it's a fact. you clearly have no idea of the east indian population of victoria, it's not hard to imagine it whatsoever. peacocks billboard area? that's small time shit, we are talking about the CRD not some shitty corner."
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,Akon_Wakon,3,Mon May 4 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"they are simply more ruthless and violent than the older gangs like the HA.   Definitely not. The HA, and their affiliated biker gangs, can be just as ruthless.   look at vancouver, the HA has been pushed around by the asian and indo canadian gangs because of this, it's a fact.   No. The Asian and Indo-Canadian gangs control a great deal of Richmind and Surrey, due to the high number of related ethnicities in the area. They've had conflicts with the HA, of course, but they more or less took control of an area that the HA weren't active in to begin with, and the HA hasn't opposed them because nobody wants a drawn-out gang war. They have some influence over the surrounding areas, but they do not control Vancouver. Vancouver isn't really controlled by any one gang or group of gangs, although there is a surprising amount of old skool (read: European, mobsters, etc.) influence in the area. The HA control a lot of nearby areas, like most of Port Coquitlam, some parts of Surrey, and greater regions like Langley, Abbotsford and Mission. There's the occasional Asian or Indo-Canadian gang member in these areas, but they're usually coordinating their business, to some extent anyhow, with the local HA (and similarly, the HA coordinate their business with the Asian and Indo-Canadian gangs when they're working in Richmond or most of Surrey).  The big difference between the HA, their affiliated biker gangs, and the Asian and Indo-Canadian gangs is that the biker gangs tend to move contraband using their own resources (boats they own, or have direct control over, trucking companies they own, etc.) The Asian and Indo-Canadian gangs on the other hand tend to move contraband through Westshore Terminals, where they have people positioned.   you clearly have no idea of the east indian population of victoria, it's not hard to imagine it whatsoever. peacocks billboard area? that's small time shit, we are talking about the CRD not some shitty corner.

VictoriaBC,34q4bj,TylerrelyT,7,Sun May 3 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"i don't think you have a clue what you are talking about. the HA are known as being one of the more ""clean"" gangs in BC. the indo canadian and asian gangs are FAR more ruthless and are involved in far more public violence than the hells angels. you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out, look at all the murders in vancouver and look the family ties and names associated. the guys you see on the street wearing HA gear are not generally the higher ups, the guys that run those shows are often men closely associated within the business community who you wouldn't call a ""greasy fucking biker""."
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,nrtphotos,5,Mon May 4 02:31:03 2015 UTC,So because biker gangs are no longer the worst gang on the block we should welcome them with open arms?
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,TylerrelyT,0,Mon May 4 04:42:02 2015 UTC,"no, but making this big a scene at the cost of the city is absolutely insane. let's be real though, like it or not someone is going to sell drugs and organize prostitution. i'd far rather have it be the hells angels than the un gang or some other clusterfuck of a gang from the mainland doing it."
VictoriaBC,34q4bj,nrtphotos,4,Mon May 4 05:04:08 2015 UTC,I think they kind of asked for it.  A criminal organization who deals in drugs and prostitution opens a home base complete with a billboard and signage off a major street.

The drug stuff is where the Mafia really lost a lot of it's good attributes.  The bikers in Ontario dealt with the mafia occasionally, and had a bit more of a set of ethics than these BC bikers.  I laugh at the notion that there are ""good bikers"" in BC.  They are incredibly shitty compared to the way Italians run things."

VictoriaBC,34q4bj,Brocket-99,-2,Mon May 4 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"There have been mumblings about the Italian mafia having a prescence in Vancouver.  The going theory is that they have kept a low profile - and all the other gangs are drawing all the attention.  For example, if the Hell's Angels are regarded as ""low profile"" compared to the other retards in BC, the Italian mafia would seem non-existent - as they are much smarter than these bikers.  If you stay out of the drug business - and run it old school, just prostitution and gambling, it's pretty hard to end up on the radar.  There is a bit of reverence for the Biker in BC, as it's kind of part of the culture here - I get it.  They think they are their claim to fame, the Hell's Angels, but they are nothing to be proud of - it's  a bunch of unwashed bums pushing meth on kids - and acting as if they have any morals - pretending they have moral higher ground like the Italians - they don't have anything respectable about them."

VictoriaBC,34jsr2,Numerolophile,-1,Fri May 1 19:57:16 2015 UTC,that's what local cops call it when they want to arrest someone but don't actually have a legal reason to arrest them. That or if they need someone drugged up and denied a lawyer for a while so the can manufacture some evidence.   link for the skeptical.
VictoriaBC,34jsr2,MumblesInTheCorner,-2,Sun May 3 09:01:17 2015 UTC,Did you even read the linked article? Vicpd has been abusing the MHA to 'dissapear' people for some time now. It's like their #1 tactic if they can't  manufacture a criminal charge on the spot. Fortuatly they recently had their ass handed to them by opcc for using the mha to deny legal representation.  time will tell if this makes them change But I seriously doubt it.
VictoriaBC,34jsr2,XavierWoodshed,3,Sun May 3 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"Not that this changes any of what you've said, but there seems to be a lot of misinformation being thrown around in this thread.

What I was clarifying for him was that there was some background to this call, and it wasn't just an MHA manufactured for the sake of an arrest (which was his concern). What may seem like a small detail can make a lot difference in perception to some."
VictoriaBC,34jsr2,XavierWoodshed,0,Mon May 4 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, again my apologies."
VictoriaBC,34jsr2,MumblesInTheCorner,0,Mon May 4 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"When they decide to hold you while the police illegally seize your property,  AND actively  deny you any access to a lawyer or advocat  or even a close family member. then once the police are done seizing your property they just let you leave without even so much as a a follow up. Thats not concern, that's abuse.    Then consider further what they did to me. They took everything I said while I was drugged up(completely black out drugged)  and denied a lawyer and attempted to bring a criminal case against me.   Thank god I had the finances to pay a good lawyer for defense  and the judge who ruled the case against me without merit and ordered my property returned immediately.   Even at that the VicPD defied the judges order until he eventually told the chief(after 2 weeks of run around) that he had 15 min to return my property or be held in contempt.   This was not about concern, this was about seizing property on the first excuse they had.  In the 4 years since and especially after the article came out I have spoken to dozens of seemingly perfectly normal people who have had the same experience at the hands of the VicPd.   its been 4 years of hell putting my life back together  after the 'care' I received from VicPd and VIHA. Nightmares, Demophobia, panic attacks any time I so much as see a cop. This was not care in any form, it was mental rape.  The only good that I can see having come out of this is that OPCC ruled that my rights were violated (further affirming the judges ruling) and that police/viha cannot deny you a lawyer. Whether or not they actually follow this ruling is a matter yet to be seen.   I also want to acknowledge Rob Wipond, without his stedfast determination and reporting this abuse would have never seen the light of day. He really deserved the award he got for that article.  I realize its probably not the same in this case(thank you Xavier for setting me straight on that) but I do get very concerned about abuse when the words MHA, police and ERT are put together.

VictoriaBC,34eu9z,iknowwhereiam,12,Thu Apr 30 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Not really in Victoria, but have you gone out to one of the old railway trestles? The Kinsol Trestle in Shawnigan Lake is really quite impressive and the area is quite beautiful. It is part of the Trans Canada Trail, so if you are feeling really ambitious you can hike/cycle there from Victoria. If you just want to do a day trip in a car, it's a pretty short drive out to Shawnigan Lake, and then about a 1.5 km walk along the old rail grade to the trestle (lots of parking). Once you're out that way you could grab lunch somewhere in Shawnigan Lake, and then check out Merridale Cidery (if you're into that sort of thing)."

Just next to Mt. Work is Gowlland Tod Provincial Park. The McKenzie Bight hike is short with a nice waterfall along the way (depending on route). Leads to fairly secluded beach with a great view of Finlayson Arm.  If you are feeling extra hearty, you can do an all-day hike. Park near Hartland.

VictoriaBC,34flac,murfburffle,0,Thu Apr 30 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should have guess it would be a stupid ""Kids will choke on them!"" thing. It's the most ridiculous shit but it comes from the land of ridiculous shit, so not really a surprise. Growing up as a kid, I basically swam in a kiddie pool of lego. Our lego buckets contained enough small parts to murder every small child in western Canada and no one ever called for a ban on that. The kinder egg itself is way too large for anyone to accidentally swallow it, so the argument that being a ""toy within a snack"" is absurd. The choking doesn't occur until the toy has been opened up and played with...  Another fine demonstration of absurd overprotection. I would bet that if Kinder Surprised was ""Made in the USA"", things would have played out differently."

There's just no sense at all to trying to claim it's harmful. Even the UK rejected calls to ban the item because the few ACTUAL cases of choking fatalities occurred DAYS after the chocolate was consumed and were just while the toys were being played with/eaten.  The problem is that the toys are being given to children who are too small for them. Kinder Surprise, like any other small toy, has an age warning on the side. That should be good enough."

According to a 2013 city report, anywhere from 250 to 719 additional units are needed in the city.  “The majority are doing so because they are homeless, and many have mental health and/or substance abuse issues. For many of these people, successful permanent housing opportunities must include on-going support and services. In some cases, shelters are also not an option for individuals who have behavioural issues caused by addictions or mental illness,” the report reads.   http://globalnews.ca/news/1917636/victoria-say-homeless-problem-an-increasing-drain-on-budget/"

VictoriaBC,348nn7,broknbones,3,Wed Apr 29 06:28:56 2015 UTC,based on the breweries I would recommend the guild freehouse on wharf at yates st.  good selection of beers and excellent variety of food
VictoriaBC,348nn7,stwatchman,4,Wed Apr 29 04:33:25 2015 UTC,I'd recommend The Churchill over The Guild. I've never had good service there.
VictoriaBC,348nn7,ultcraka,6,Thu Apr 30 01:51:30 2015 UTC,Walk the inner harbour and go to Red Fish Blue Fish. Great seafood right on the boardwalk.
VictoriaBC,348nn7,iknowwhereiam,5,Wed Apr 29 06:12:30 2015 UTC,"The Drake on Pandora is a great place for a pint. If you don't mind a walk and want to do a self guided brewery tour, I suggest starting at Spinnikers, then crossing the bay St bridge (not very pretty, it's industrial) from there you can hit hoyne, and moon under water, and driftwood (do they even have a tasting room?) then go up to government and hit Vancouver island brewery, and Phillips,  then head down to wharf St, and you'll find Canoe brewpub, and swans brewpub right by the blue bridge. By then you should be good and drunk.   For touristy things, China town is the oldest in Canada, and second oldest in the world behind San Francisco. The parliament and inner harbour are pretty. Fishermans wharf is vibrant and beautiful, James bay in quaint, and th Ogden point breakwater is amazing ( plus Dallas Rd in general is really pretty) then head through cook St village. For food, I always have a great time at The Mint, Tapa Bar can be fun. I love Garrick's, Guild Freehouse, and the Drake for a pint and snack.  The university is also very pretty this time of year, and close to cadboro bay."
VictoriaBC,348nn7,ebbomega,2,Wed Apr 29 05:46:27 2015 UTC,"Ugh, Garrick's. I don't get why everybody is so gaga over a place whose primary selling feature (lots of beers) comes from dirty taps. Every. Time.  The Yates St Taphouse does everything I wish Garrick's did."
VictoriaBC,348nn7,iknowwhereiam,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Noted. I am also a fan of the Taphouse on Yates, I was just thinking that for tourist/convenience sake, Garrick's is in a pretty great location comparatively. I have no allegiance to anywhere, but I do love other people's opinions."
VictoriaBC,348nn7,ebbomega,2,Wed Apr 29 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"True enough, though that strip along Yates is livening up from just The Patch on one end and Foo on the other. Between Meat & Bread, Interactivity, and now finally something decent in what is now Yates St Taphouse, there's more reasons to head there.  If you like Garrick's location, I'd be quicker to go to the Churchill."

I love Swan's it has a special place in my heart from when I was at UVic (I no longer live in Vic). It's as the bottom of my list because it is the last stop of my self guided brewery tour. It's next to the Drake, which makes things even MORE convenient."

VictoriaBC,348nn7,ebbomega,0,Sat May 2 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"If you're checking out beers, also check out the Canoe Brewpub. They have a lot of really good stuff there.   If you can get a bike out here, I recommend checking out the Galloping Goose. It's actually a really nice bike ride through the backalleys of the city. Lots of beautiful spots in there.  A lot of people will tell you Bin4 is the best burger in town, personally I don't see the appeal, especially when Pink Bicycle has TRUFFLE FRIES. Not gonna find any Kintaro-level ramen around here but Foo Ramen Bar has some nice variations, and the main Foo spot is great for boxed asian food. There's Noodle Box too but you have one in Kits too. For lounge, I highly recommend Veneto at the Hotel Rialto (Douglas & Pandora). Sit at the bar, Josh makes a mean rum drink. Also their Duck Poutine is legendary.  While we're on Poutine, if you head over to Esquimalt there's the original La Belle Patate, and they make the most authentic poutine on the western seaboard that I've found.  Most of the Touristy stuff is along the waterfront around Parliament (Inner Harbour) and up Government Street (until you get to Chinatown - oldest Chinatown in Canada, I believe).  Oh, and if you go to Centennial Square (by City hall at Douglas & Pandora) on Friday they have a food truck festival there. Good chance to try some of the street food around here."

VictoriaBC,3463dv,StackLeeAdams,20,Tue Apr 28 16:26:18 2015 UTC,Let's fund the transit system properly first.  Bus lanes without busses to stick on them are useless.  Every day busses are passing up riders because they're too full.  Every day riders are left wondering where their bus went when it doesn't show up.
VictoriaBC,3463dv,ssbtech,6,Tue Apr 28 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"The buses in this city are pretty crappy unless you get on the 27/28 and other buses that run like every 5 minutes - then it doesn't matter if you miss the bus, just wait for the next one.  But yeah, sometimes I've been 10 minutes early for a time posted for the bus and I end up catching the next posted time - I often wonder what happened to the bus I didn't catch."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,euxneks,12,Wed Apr 29 00:29:23 2015 UTC,My first question is: why the hell aren't they doing this to Government Street instead?
VictoriaBC,3463dv,MrYYJ,3,Tue Apr 28 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"Businesses on the street are opposed to closing Government to automobile traffic. I live in James Bay and if I want to travel north I typically take Wharf and then go up Johnson to Government to Douglas, or go over the bridge to Esquimalt Road and out to Colwood or Langford (it's quicker than the highway).   I never take Government Street north, and I only take government street south until Pandora.  So close Government to traffic. Get rid of the t-shirt shops and cheezy souvenir shops. Open shops that local downtown residents like me might want to frequent."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,sometimes_i_work,9,Wed Apr 29 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"It already is pedestrian dominant, and not big enough to serve the purpose of transit/biking/walking combo."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,sometimes_i_work,6,Tue Apr 28 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"But Transit is an important part, and Douglas is the most central downtown route."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,sometimes_i_work,6,Tue Apr 28 18:24:08 2015 UTC,"Reliable transit is integral to any urban centre.   The bigger and better a city becomes, the more it needs to push cars out of the centre, and grow transit and pedestrian traffic support."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,elliam,4,Tue Apr 28 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"Because well implemented transit is the only thing that the city should be focusing on. Cars are a luxury that we are running out of space for. The backups that are everywhere during rush hour are proof of that, and we're adding more high density housing."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,elliam,3,Tue Apr 28 18:35:38 2015 UTC,You asked why transit is important. I answered. Pay attention.
VictoriaBC,3463dv,hatmatter,2,Tue Apr 28 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought as well, since Government is such a tourist walk anyway and basically pointless to drive down."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,Holypapalsmear,0,Tue Apr 28 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"Because that would make sense, cost less and just all round be a good idea. Obviously the smarter idea is to make it even harder for people to get in and out of downtown as that would encourage more people to go there."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,nurdboy42,-1,Tue Apr 28 20:31:48 2015 UTC,Because the people that run this city are morons.
VictoriaBC,3463dv,sometimes_i_work,20,Tue Apr 28 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea. Blanshard is already a main artery to get into town quickly, and if you're coming from the westshore, use Wharf at Hillside to get into town.  I'd love to see a community-centred main drag in Victoria, supporting transit, walking and biking. Suits the city perfectly."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,11fiffty9,10,Wed Apr 29 04:27:40 2015 UTC,I agree it would look nice. But have your driven on Blanshard or Douglas during high traffic times? It can get busy. Now combine them without adding extra lanes to Blanshard and traffic will be hell.
VictoriaBC,3463dv,RoosterGis,5,Tue Apr 28 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Driving downtown already sucks, which is why I bike downtown whenever feasible. When the city expands driving infrastructure it incentivizes driving for the short period of time that congestion is alleviated but before more cars fill up added lanes.   I think downtown should be a place you drive to, rather than a place you drive through."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,sometimes_i_work,3,Tue Apr 28 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do drive during rush hour. As the article states, removing traffic from Douglas would be 10+ years in the future, and would definitely have to be combined with other solutions for alleviating traffic. Personally, I'd like those solutions to include getting people out of their cars (light rail to Langford, better transit support and ridership, better biking infrastructure that doesn't involve crossing highways).   But honestly. Our traffic? Nothing. Frustrating when you're in it, but nothing compared to Vancouver or Toronto. This is the only place I've ever lived where 'rush hour' is literally that. An hour."

VictoriaBC,3463dv,RoosterGis,8,Wed Apr 29 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic about the proposal as well. Victoria is a small city and I think improvements such as this are much needed to expand the urban core. Douglas St as it stands is rather unattractive, which does not promote walking traffic towards its businesses. Nor is it an effective vehicle corridor, the combination of these deficits are an ugly, congested barrier bisecting an otherwise beautiful city."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,ebbomega,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that Blanshard would cease to be an artery to get into town quickly, and will very quickly get congested now.  The reason we need Douglas is the same way why Broadway and 12th in Vancouver work so well in concert with each other. If you're looking to go long distances, keep to 12th, but if you're turning left, running into major transit routes, needing to get to somewhere on the main strip, you go to Broadway.  But if you remove Broadway from the equation, the vast majority of congestion will just bump itself over to 12th.  In Victoria the same thing will happen. Yes, Douglas is a clogged mess, but all you do by eliminating it as an option is turn Blanshard into a clogged mess and then there's no quick way to get in/out of downtown."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,vayposaurus,7,Wed Apr 29 00:26:45 2015 UTC,"Is Douglas St. really the problem here? I don't really see this solving much, and it could easily have the opposite-of-intended effect, where anyone driving just won't bother going downtown unless they have to."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,spergery,5,Tue Apr 28 23:50:49 2015 UTC,"Douglas is already a pain in the ass to drive on so I tend to avoid it anyway.  If we wind up with a more interesting downtown core, I'm fine with that.  But they're going to have to put that traffic somewhere, and that somewhere looks to be Blanshard.  Blanshard's already packed during peak hours; this certainly won't help things.  And it means half the city would be turning left at Hillside/whatever to get to the Malahat, which is an idiotic idea."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,Fleemer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:50:35 2015 UTC,How to kill downtown 101. Make it so no one wants to drive there.
VictoriaBC,3463dv,WithMyLeftHand,2,Wed Apr 29 05:32:39 2015 UTC,"On the contrary. Congestion, which we can all agree is bad on Douglas, affects economics negatively. Pedestrianization done right can be positive."
VictoriaBC,3463dv,spergery,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Making pedestrian-friendly areas is great for shopping, dining, tourism, and culture.  But it's terrible for people who have to go downtown for work.  There needs to be a balance: by all means, create places for people to walk around and enjoy downtown.  But you also need to preserve corridors for people to get into and out of downtown."

VictoriaBC,3489x1,ionsquare,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"My guess would be it's illegal unless they are paying at least minimum wage.  If they're not, I hope you would report them."

You come in for a short shift and they assess your ability to do the job. Your friend will probably be paid minimum wage for the hours worked. This is how the last company I worked for conducted interviews."
VictoriaBC,3489x1,PythonBabysitter,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"A really quick and dirty Google search brought nothing up for me as far as legality is concerned, but trial shifts/working interviews are very common in the food service industry.   Normally you would be invited to come in for a full or half shift, which you would be paid out for at the end of the day. This is to ensure that you actually have the skills to do the job you may be hired for and that you fit in well with the work environment.   I would never agree to do a trial shift for free though and neither should your friend, if that's the situation."

VictoriaBC,3489x1,autowikibot,1 point,Fri May 1 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"At-will employment:       At-will employment is a term used in U.S. labor law for contractual relationships in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish ""just cause"" for termination), and without warning.  When an employee is acknowledged as being hired ""at will"", courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. The rule is justified by its proponents on the basis that an employee may be similarly entitled to leave his or her job without reason or warning.  In contrast, the practice is seen as unjust by those who view the employment relationship as characterized by inequality of bargaining power.

VictoriaBC,3489x1,PythonBabysitter,1 point,Fri May 1 05:16:06 2015 UTC,"Trial shifts are beneficial in a situation where an employer has more than one candidate who might be right for the position. Rather than just straight up hiring five people, you can have each one come in on a different day (usually their day off from their current place of employment) and then have your pick of the litter, so to speak.  Also, most people keep working while they hunt for a different job. It's idiotic to think that you would hire someone based on their resume, wait two weeks for them to start because they need to finish up at their old job, train them, and then it turns out that they can't count past ten or lift anything over two pounds and you have to fire them, starting the hiring process all over again."

Styles, fabrics, colours and patterns are more varied than in most suits; sturdier and thicker fabrics are commonly used, such as corduroy, suede, denim, leather, and tweed.

VictoriaBC,33wwfb,ionsquare,2,Mon Apr 27 17:19:56 2015 UTC,"Roundabouts can be great. IMO one of the problems with the one near the airport is that it's at the crest of a hill (at least when you're coming from the Pat Bay.

VictoriaBC,33xh3c,Boss-1,2,Sun Apr 26 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"We did a full kitchen Reno with them. Overall we were very pleased. The designer was very helpful, the install team was clean and thoughtful, and the end product is pretty good quality for what seemed like a very reasonable cost. The designer in particular made some very thoughtful changes to what we thought we wanted, each of which we have appreciated since. The installers use a ton of little trim pieces that make the kitchen look a lot more custom than I thought it would.   During the process they worry about going back to IKEA to replace broken stuff. They also came back a year later to fix some issues around the dishwasher.   I think the only downside was that because we did our own contracting, there were she additional delays because you're never really sure when to book the sub's. So you lose a bunch of days waiting for plumbers, flooring, electricians, appliances, countertops and tile guys. Annoying, but not impossible."

I tried pulled pork poutine from PIG, and in all honesty I found their portion sizes pretty normal sized, which wasn't what I was expecting. The barbeque sauce was okay but not great, and the pork was in surprisingly large chunks for pulled pork."

So you either have to take the chance and park across the street in that parking lot or drive around the block looking for parking.. Something I hate when I look at places to eat..  Second it was really cold inside as the didn't seem to have any heat, kinda run down feeling and a bit dirty like they only clean the table tops if that.

VictoriaBC,33qzjk,Sasken,55,Fri Apr 24 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Not just international or distant tourism either. I have family on the mainland but I seldom travel over there to have visits because the cost of ferrying back and forth is so expensive that I could just as soon fly to a resort location for a weekend at the same cost. It's insane. It's not that I can't afford to, but I refuse to play their game unless there's something really compelling to travel for.  Nevermind tourists, the LOCALS want to have as little as possible to do with the ferry system here. If prices were reasonable, I would make much more frequent trips off the island but as it stands I probably barely average more than one trip per year and only when really necessary. I'm far more likely to fly off the island than ferry off of it."
VictoriaBC,33qzjk,jrebs,19,Fri Apr 24 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'm the same. I go to the mainland for work a few times a year but I can expense that. Other than that I leave the island maybe once a year.  Most people I know travel off-island less now than they used to and the #1 reason is the cost of the ferry.

VictoriaBC,33qzjk,TotallyOffTopic_,6,Sat Apr 25 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"It's acceptable because there is more volume on the Tsawassen-Swartz Bay route, and because the smaller communities, notably Sunshine Coast, which is totally isolated from the rest of the province by road, could never cover the costs of ferry service.

VictoriaBC,33mbfk,spergery,-6,Fri Apr 24 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"Seems to me if they're innocent until proven, they shouldn't be suspended at all?  Followup bonus question: If found guilty, is the pay taken during suspension reclaimed or does the perpetrator retain those earnings?"
VictoriaBC,33mbfk,jrebs,28,Fri Apr 24 03:20:39 2015 UTC,"Suspending someone with pay is essentially saying, ""there's enough suspicion to warrant removing you from service so as to avoid causing additional harm to the public, but not enough proof at this point to deprive you and your family of your livelihood.""  It's not a punishment, but rather a precaution.  I don't know what happens to back-pay after the investigation concludes.  I suspect they keep it (although legal costs would probably wipe it out in this case)"
VictoriaBC,33mbfk,spergery,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:10:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I get the argument for suspend-with-pay but I would think that pay should be reclaimed if the offences are found to be proven. Otherwise it is quite legitimately paid vacation before being let go.

VictoriaBC,33mbfk,natebx,-9,Thu Apr 23 22:25:32 2015 UTC,Good idea. You should be in charge of overhauling the excessive speeding penalties in our province which severely punish someone for simply driving too fast on our incredibly low-limit highways. Several hundreds of dollars of fines plus well over a thousands dollars in impound fees for getting caught speeding. Compassion indeed.
VictoriaBC,33mbfk,jrebs,3,Thu Apr 23 20:08:58 2015 UTC,I agree with everything except that I should be in charge of overhauling that. I'm no expert in crime and punishment. These fines are outrageous specially because such fines severely punish a poor/lower income person while giving a wealthy/higher income person a near-pass.

They were probably a bit in shock. I really doubt they waited five minutes before doing anything, though.  I mean come on, for all the employees know, she just got a bit of drink spilled on her and it's no big deal. Hard to tell from behind the counter if it's a serious burn issue or if she was just overreacting."

You can end up with a lot of customers who don't want to have workers fawning all over them. I remember one man who spilled his drink on himself back when I worked there and he panicked when we tried to help and ran in embarrassment. Similarly you deal with a lot of people who want you to be there just to serve them their coffee, nothing else.   Somebody wants a free coffee, an apology, and may like to complain more than the average. The situation happened between her and the man, not her and the staff."
VictoriaBC,33nqwz,canehdianchick,8,Fri Apr 24 02:57:06 2015 UTC,Gf worked at sbux up until a few months ago - just confirmed that first-aid kits are sorely lacking in stores and that bad burns are part of the job. Employees with first-aid training are few and far between and poorly scheduled.  The kit in her store was so empty that she stocked her own supplies and gave them to other employees when injuries happened. The manager refused to reimburse her and wouldn't fill the in-store kit.  I'm glad she left.

I can't speak for other stores, but ours always had a first aid kit.  When it comes to the temperatures, I bet you that woman was not burned by regular temperature coffee.  Quite a few customers come in asking for their drink ""extra hot"", which we are able to do, up to around 180-190 degrees F (yes, some people specify that temperature), which can absofuckinglutely leave some burns.  I don't see why this is grounds for a lawsuit though, as this isn't the standard for drinks and it'll always have a warning on the cup; the store isn't responsible for your clumsy ass crashing into people."

The interesting bit of that story is that, indeed, the coffee was being kept WAY to hot, just below boiling. The woman actually had to be hospitalized for a bit (i think some photos of the damage might be floating about, but as I hear it, the burns were a bit more than aloe vera could handle).  Unless she can prove the Starbucks was keeping their coffee hotter than they should (as in the McDicks story), odds are they'll point out the coffee cups these days have ""Warning!

VictoriaBC,33kh3h,bcballer411,21,Thu Apr 23 06:29:40 2015 UTC,"Racing veteran here.  The TC10K is crowded. CROWDED. It's not a great race for a time goal (unless you're an elite or assigned to the first couple of corrals) because there will be 12,000+ runners and several bottlenecks once you hit the residential areas. You're also running alongside a LOT of people who aren't going for time goals, who are just happy to be running at all, who will run slowly in a single horizontal line with their entire friend group and not realize or care that they're blocking your way. But they have as much right to be there as you do. So if a fast time is your goal, be prepared for some frustration.  If running for a goal time, start as close as possible to the front of your assigned corral. (And please start in your assigned corral -- don't crash the next-fastest one thinking it will get you to the finish line faster. It won't. TC10K is chip-timed and your time only starts once you cross the starting mat.)  Don't burn out. Do the first km slower than you feel like going. You'll be full of adrenaline and your pace will be faster than you're used to and it will feel easy. Dial it back a bit and save that energy for the second half of the race, you're going to need it.  Avoid the first water station, it's always too crowded.  At water stations, grab your drink and keep moving (fold your cup to drink without spilling). If you want to walk, move to the outside -- don't just stop in the middle of the road.  Read up on basic race etiquette and have fun!"

Many runners will bunch up on the inside around the corner, slowing down the pack. Even though you may think you're going a longer distance by running on the outside, you'll in fact run it quicker.

VictoriaBC,33jj9b,SlurpeeMoney,22,Thu Apr 23 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'd like to advise extreme caution when considering a private post-secondary school. They have far lower standards, across the board, than public institutions do.  I do not know if the Victoria College of Art has these problems, but it's something to keep in mind when considering any private school.  Lower standards in the private post-secondary sector often include:   Lower application requirements; meaning people who are not ready to study at the post-secondary level are allowed into programs, often against their best interests. Lower standards for teaching staff, meaning you get instructors who can't get into jobs at public colleges/universities because they are unqualified. Stripped down, bare-bones curriculum: People end up with credentials, without actually learning all of the fundamental skills they need to continue their education or enter the workforce. Lack of transferable course credits: I looked at VCA's website. I could find no information stating that their diplomas transfer to universities. This is a major red flag if you ever wish to complete a Bachelor in Fine Arts degree.   The Victoria College of Art is a non-profit school. That's a positive, because it means they probably aren't a diploma mill like certain ""schools"" in that area. For-profit schools are where the lower standards become super common.  Their website makes me nervous. It's cluttered and unprofessional looking. Considering that many prospective students use a website as their first point of contact for a school, it's not something a good institution should skimp on.  Have you considered taking a more general visual arts program for a couple of years? Learning various 2D and 3D mediums can only improve your understanding of movement and proportion for animation.  After that, you could transfer to larger art-focused institution and focus on animation. For example, you could head to Emily Carr to complete a Bachelors of Media Arts in Animation. They accept transfer credits from a wide variety of colleges and unis in BC. Note that the Victoria College of Art is sadly not on the list.  VISA, Camosun, and UVic are on Emily Carr's transfer list. All three offer general visual arts programs.  Good luck with your education. Hope I've been of some help."
VictoriaBC,33jj9b,Honeykill,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:08:06 2015 UTC,Only school near by that I would recommend for any arts program is VFS. I have three friends there now one for Animation (graded last year) and on for Sound Tech (Half Way done) and another for Game Design (half way done) The animator got a job before she even left school working for Nerd Core and then moved to a new company not sure which one. My sound tech friend has had three job offers already and the game design has had 1. An entire year of Game design and animators at VFS a few years ago got picked up by Blizard and all were given jobs with them.   So yeah VFS is pretty much THE ONLY school I would recommend considering for that field of arts

VictoriaBC,33hnjw,Western_Islander,3,Fri Apr 24 01:37:32 2015 UTC,"These communities are cute and all, but you can house significantly more people in the same amount of space with a multi-floor building with common areas and facilities. If the goal is to provide cheap, permanent housing for as many people as possible wouldn't that be a better investment?  That said, I can see some possible benefits to these communities.   Lower startup costs. You can have one of these units built in a day or two and a building could take years (assuming you already have the land available and zoned). More of a neighbourhood, community vibe. Although I have seen co-op apartment buildings that also have that spirit. More of a sense of ownership and personal responsibility for residents. I imagine that could be empowering for people trying to turn their lives around.   I imagine the point is moot, since I doubt you could get one of these built anywhere in Victoria or the surrounding municipalities. Even if you could overcome the NIMBYism, I can't think of any viable locations."

VictoriaBC,33icd3,dentonite,0,Thu Apr 23 06:13:02 2015 UTC,"Taken from a comment on the Saanich Council Watchdogs Facebook Group, which was a response to basically the same thing as you've said.  ""When you say that the PC has already conducted an External Independent review, yes she did to see if there were violations of the privacy laws which Saanich were previously denying to the mayor and the public. There were many violations found by the OIPC! Further Denham verified there was no external recommendation from an external audit company to install spyware. The PC report showed that they broke Privacy Laws and the reasons given for the installation was basically (sorry to say it but it is true) a LIE. Now, because this was not an installation to enhance security? What was it? There can now only be one reason...And to get away from that reason we are now hearing it was a ""mistake"" and various other stories from Councillors to the point they want to conduct their own investigation.  We cannot proceed to criminal prosecution at this time because in criminal law you have to prove the ""act"" and the ""mental intent"" and the balance of probability in a criminal prosecution is 100% (51% in a civil action). The “act” was committed and proved. The “mental intent” of why someone was doing this has not been proved and can only be after every individual who was spying can be identified. Therefore Police cannot do anything at this time so an External Independent Investigation is the only way that we can prove this unless the individual/s responsible owns up and comes forward.  Once identified the Police have no choice to get involved and only job they will really be doing is figuring out what charges to lay and against which individual and hand it over Crown Prosecution with the recommended charges (which can be many). (Most of the investigative work and signed statements will have been done by the External Independent Investigators) . So there is a need for an INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL INVESTIGATION to get to the bottom of this once and for all and I fear the reason why certain Councillors are reluctant to do this. It could become very serious matter if there was one."""

Actually:   You can't proceed to criminal prosecution because this is provincial legislation, which means that offenses under it are by definition not criminal. This is Con Law 101; read s. 91 of the CA, 1867 some time.  Offenses under s. 74-74.1 of FOIPPA are strict liability, like speeding; it doesn't matter if you meant to do it or not.  ""Balance of probabilities"" is a test used only in civil actions; criminal charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and again, this isn't criminal. The mens rea/actus reus evaluation - which is being badly butchered here - isn't required.

They also have the discretion not to, like, for instance, not pulling over and ticketing every single person driving 1 km/h over the limit. The rest of this paragraph is mostly nonsense and tinfoil-hatted paranoia.  Basically: every single person involved in this petition has fundamentally misunderstood what's going on."

There are a lot of weasily turns of phrase in this study as well. This reads with a clear agenda and I would prefer a cost-benefit analysis to be neutral.   That said, there is some stuff in there that might be worth looking at. For example, the author talks about tour buses going directly to the ships and notes the amount of noise, pollution, congestion and wear on the roads they generate. I think he's right about them being too big for JB and it is silly to have direct service when Victoria is a short walk away. More frequent city transit or even a direct run seems like it would be a better fit.   Anyways, everyone should give this thing a skim before passing judgment one way or the other."

Here's a comment, which is basically a TL;DR and sums up the cruise industry, from my business partner (who has many, many years experience with this) on the article,   The big problem with the cruise industry is first of all that it is so huge and has an enormous footprint. But larger than that is the fact that the cruise ships ARE the destination. If it was up to them, even less passengers would disembark at any port..While the pictures and concept of tropical islands or ""foireing"" destinations merely help them sell their packages. Fear mongering news only helps them in pushing uneducated tourists to decide in these options with their endless smorgasbords casinos and the inevitable pressure they place on the destinations with their need for huge and damaging infrastructure requirements among other things.   This is why we need to be cautious, while at the same time recognizing that currently the Cruise industry is having an economic benefit to Greater Victoria."

VictoriaBC,33bs75,gillbilly72,2,Wed Apr 22 03:47:10 2015 UTC,If you drive around the back you can see that the parking lot is full of mail trucks. I never knew what the building behind the liquor store on fort and foul bay was until telus switched all of their vans and trucks to white.
VictoriaBC,33bs75,sorangutan,2,Wed Apr 22 04:27:07 2015 UTC,I think they used to have a small sign on the building that had the BC Mail Plus logo on it as well. Would have been some time between 2006 and 2008 when I had occasion to drive/bus by the building regularly.
VictoriaBC,33bs75,tko78,7,Tue Apr 21 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"Fun fact... that building has been renovated. Many years ago it was the Provincial vehicle inspection station.   As a child, I went through there with my grandfather. They would test headlights, brakes, mechanical inspection, etc. Sort of the Air Care of the late 70s.    It's rare but sometimes you'll still see old vehicles around town with the inspection sticker still on the passenger side of the windshield. It's a coloured decal with the expiry(?) date punched out."

As for the first section of beach: No firepits, no benches, no tables, no fresh water, no garbage, etc...   its a beach...   That's it... (there are some pit toilets and two bear lockers for food however.)  sit in the sand, or on logs... Build a pit out of sand and stones (I would recommend hiking in some local wood (dont import bugs etc), driftwood can be hard to find after busy times so best to bring everything you need. Again there's no water there so you need to hike that in.  The hike is is maybe 15-20 min tops, and although there is a slight hill the trail is totally fit for a wheelbarrow if you feel like being ""that guy.""  As for what to bring, the normal stuff is fine, but if you want to be baller you could consider: -Tarps + rope (for rain cover) -Blanket for sand reduction  Cost: dont remember but its reasonable, maybe $12 ish? Bring cash as its one of those envelope into a strong box things.  The entrance in is really easy to miss and has pretty shitty signage so dont be surprised if you overshoot it. Also the drive down to parking could be considered to be approaching sketchy if your not in a decent vehicle. You could most defiantly bottom out/high center a small car.  good luck!"

Idk how much it costs per night but, if you're drinking and partying, you should make sure to pay. Lock your car because surfer douchebags who think they own the beach steal stuff and vandalize property sometimes.

VictoriaBC,33a8kq,-___--___-___--___-,3,Mon Apr 20 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"I think most institutions have access to a broad range of funds, and these funds should be common to them all. If you're after returns, look at the funds themselves. They are all aimed for particular risks. Just watch the MER (management expense ratio) as it eats your return. If you're young and don't want to pay too much attention to the funds, look at index funds to a particular stock indexes. They buy the basket of funds in an index so it follows the indexes and generally have low MER.   Having said that, you may want service. Go with a bank you think serves you well. See if you can get the funds you're after.   I'm not being condescending in saying this but with that level of investment, you will do most of the work. You'll need to ask them questions.

VictoriaBC,33a8kq,Sunray21A,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"Banks will put you into something decent, a wrap fund with a bunch of mutual funds balanced to your risk, especially if you have only a few thousand to invest and opening a new account. The banks' 'advice' is overrated. They will say what you yourself have already determined, your risk level, and that's pretty much the extent of their advice. I even asked the bank advisor about a few other bank funds and he didn't know much about them. These wrap funds are easy as its a 'one fund' solution, though as others have mentioned the MER is high as you pay for the wrap plus the individual mutual funds.   People have talked about index investing, the most popular way is to buy exchange traded funds, funds on stock exchanges, such as Ishares, Vanguard, BMO, etc. Most people on the subs I've seen are proponents of this and only a few mutual funds beat the index over the long term. The only problem is that to keep a balanced portfolio you need a large portfolio or trading costs will eat through the advantages. I would suggest looking at Tangerine' investment funds, which used to be ING. They follow the indexes of: Canadian bonds, Canadian equity, US equity and international equity. One thing it doesn't have is emerging markets, but as you seem a bit risk adverse this shouldn't be an issue. They have 4 risk levels that adjust the various asset allocation. Also no minimum initial investment or any fees, etc. other than the 1.07% MER which is pretty good.

VictoriaBC,337g3m,gordhed,5,Mon Apr 20 06:06:08 2015 UTC,Is infrastructure really an issue?  It takes like 10 minutes to drive through downtown.  More parking would be nice.  A lot of extra traffic on the road looking for parking on Friday/Saturday/Sunday.  It takes me ten minutes to drive through town but several minutes to find parking sometimes.  Not a big deal really I do more shopping at malls then downtown as parking is easier...  Either way I'm spending money in Victoria.  I'd like to see the city reduce spending.
VictoriaBC,337g3m,jimmyvic,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"I do more shopping at malls then downtown as parking is easier   That's one of the things they want to fix.

VictoriaBC,337g3m,mr_unhelpful,13,Tue Apr 21 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's time to talk about bums.   I understand compassion and the complexity of problems faced when dealing with these issues. That said, I'm getting tired of avoiding parks after 7pm so as not to bother the ""campers"" chugging listerine while setting up for the night.  I can't imagine trying to raise a kid in Victoria proper when every dugout at Central Park is filled with piles of cigarette butts, used needles, and empty bottles of mouthwash.  Pandora and Amelia is turning into the Hastings and Main of Vancouver Island, and that is simply not acceptable. Single women avoid the area specifically when walking in the evening to avoid being harassed by drug dealing tweakers, and as a woman, that should infuriate councillor Lucas. Is there a reason the police aren't just hanging around there 24/7 to maybe upset the vibe these scumbags are looking for?   I'm not talking about a war on the homeless. I'm talking about pushing back against the shitty way the city and it's infrastructure is treated by them. We literally are running out of nice things in town, and I would be interested to see what a local leader has to say besides passing the buck on to the province or the Feds."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,RPGwarrior,8,Mon Apr 20 11:46:35 2015 UTC,"Hey I agree that homelessness is an important and critical issue in Victoria.  But I am probably in the minority of what I would like to see done.  I say get them someplace to live.  I would rather my tax dollars go to providing a house for them rather than to police to rough them up and keep moving them along.   I would rather pay the salary of a nurse to live in the building then for an ambulance to drive around dropping them off at emergency.  I think we need to start investing money into the problem instead of relying on enforcement and pushing them around the city.  I know these are difficult people to deal with.  Rude, often violent, mental health issues, but just out of self interest I think we should change directions how we deal with them.  Get them off the street and into houses!"
VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,0,Mon Apr 20 16:52:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt anyone would disagree with you, in the short term that is unrealistic. For one not all transients and drug users are homeless, some that are do not want to be housed. With a Conservative government, both provincial and federal who is going to pay for that, because neither of those two will, and the city is already paying more than it can afford. Also say you could somehow set up this utopian drug bastion, can you imagine the influx of transients Victoria would incur ? We already get transients from all over north america, word is out on how relatively easy it is to live here'0, climate, little police interference, the incredible infrastructure we have here for the homeless IE clothing programs, meals, showers etc ( all great things that we need more of, but they are already stretched beyond capacity because of all the transients coming and using up the resources )."

VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,4,Mon Apr 20 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"Spot on, if the city is going to allow homeless people to spend the night , to use your example of Central Park fields then they need to be responsible for daily cleaning up after those homeless people since they seem unable to do it for themselves.

Why not acknowledge what they are doing already?  Also: as a neighbourhood resident, please continue to limit automobile access in Beacon Hill Park."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:15:06 2015 UTC,This is part of that.
VictoriaBC,337g3m,proudcanadianeh,2,Mon Apr 20 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"Okay then. I guess my feedback would be: council does not have a lot of levers to pull. There is no budget; council cannot set differential tax rates to promote certain kinds of businesses. Council cannot create demand for a product or a service.  Instead, council can be a cheerleader. Council can promote or provide recognition to certain kinds of businesses.  Look at the vibrancy of 700 block Fort Street. You have an eclectic mix of retailers there. Some have been around for decades.  Restaurants are very much in vogue at the moment in Victoria. You have a ton of restaurants stretching from Pandora to Broughton along Blanshard.  But retail is tougher. The Ditch Records and Russell Books of the world need all the help they can get.  Fabulous Fort is doing great things but too often we hear about how unpleasant downtown Victoria is, when it's just not the case.  It's a very vibrant downtown. I live downtown with my young family. I like the convenience. You don't need a car.  Too often councillors are on the defensive about the downtown streets, but what they need to be doing is highlighting the Lower Johnson Streets and so on.  As for helping businesses succeed, there are a number of programs aimed at fostering entrepreneurs. Highlight those.  But don't pick winners. Businesses should be experts at being businesses. It's ludicrous to expect that municipal politicians are going to help them. They can't. They might be able to make a resolution at UBCM to change the municipal convenant or something.  But councillors have very little control."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,pixelwork,2,Tue Apr 21 00:18:56 2015 UTC,"A focus on improving mass transit especially to the downtown area. Make it easy for people to bus down, improve the roads to make it so people stop avoiding downtown due to hating to drive there.  Even better, get a train service up and running that goes into the downtown core. Preferably one that services up the island. Make downtown Victoria not just for tourists and some locals, make it THE downtown center of the island."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,pixelwork,0,Mon Apr 20 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"The new bridge can not take a train, thanks to the wonderful foresight of our elected officials."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,dexx4d,0,Mon Apr 20 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! What do you hate about driving downtown? Is it parking, stop lights, amount of bus traffic? How do you think it could be improved? Trains are my thing. They have all the infrastructure set up already with the E&N, but they never set it up to do local transit. I wish they'd kept the train section on the new bridge."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,ssbtech,4,Mon Apr 20 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"For me, I can tolerate it but the amount of stop lights combined with the amount of traffic annoys me.  I have heard lots of people at work though who flat out refuse to drive downtown (No reason provided, didn't ask) and as such when I suggest places there they are not interested. I found I can easily convince people to try Bin 4 selling it as not being downtown, but if I try and convince coworkers to try someplace downtown they are just not interested."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,ThatLightingGuy,4,Mon Apr 20 16:27:38 2015 UTC,I have to say that the traffic lights on Blanshard and Douglas through downtown are terrible. They are not coordinated at all and I often find myself getting stuck at a red at every single intersection. This is absurd when the intersections are only 100m apart.
VictoriaBC,337g3m,james121345,2,Mon Apr 20 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about roundabouts? Obviously intersections like Douglas-Fort, Blanshard-Yates are too small with too high flow to accommodate them, but elsewhere like Douglas-Wharf and Government and Fisgard would work. They have been shown to greatly decrease congestion and encourage economic development by increasing traffic flow. Thoughts?"
VictoriaBC,337g3m,ThatLightingGuy,0,Mon Apr 20 22:28:19 2015 UTC,I think roundabouts can be great but not on major thoroughfares here and we need either Douglas or Blanshard to be an actual route to promptly get through/past down town.
VictoriaBC,337g3m,james121345,2,Tue Apr 21 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"I don't go downtown if I can avoid it.  Traffic, lights, random 1-way streets, parking."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,ThatLightingGuy,2,Mon Apr 20 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"Lessen the tax burden on businesses and homeowners by doing away with all the silly little pet projects - speed limits, millions on bike lanes, the Beacon Hill Park closures, etc...  Ease up on the Density Bonus program that has developers paying back significant sums of money when they want to re-zone for increased density.  Stop letting special interest groups get so much airtime at city hall in an attempt to block developments (St. Andrew's school redevelopment, I'm looking at you...)   Figure out a better way to deal with the street/drug problem - businesses are being broken into, drug paraphernalia and human waste is being left all over the place.    Don't reward landlords with tax breaks for leaving their properties vacant, but offer a tax break if they fill the space in the next 6 months.  That's the only way to drive down lease rates.    If you're going to close a road like Government on Sundays, don't just close it - plan festivities for that space."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,MrYYJ,5,Mon Apr 20 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think the issues you want to talk about and the issues I want to talk about are the same things. For example, I don't believe that it's the government's responsibility to actively create jobs outside of itself, and even then, that should be limited. Here's what needs to happen from my perspective:   Infrastructure spending. This doesn't mean making a stupid bus lane on Douglas for a couple blocks to make bad traffic worse. This means fixing roads, approving development permits and actively working to improving access to existing industry.  Job creation happens most at mid-sized, established businesses. Fostering entrepreneurship works if the individuals involved are willing to take the risks, but there is little incentive or necessity to expand their business fast. The city's response to small business (10-50 employees), is to raise taxes, thereby driving them out.  The high vacancy rate downtown is because not many people are willing to pay $45/sqft for retail space. It will self-correct eventually but the city should have no part in forcing that change. That's up to the landlords, and they're perfectly fine sitting on properties until the right buyer comes along.   I want to see the city spend money on fixing roads, approving development, and in certain areas (see the Alpha-Beta-Delta street area for an example), allowing businesses to rezone the pocketed residential to commercial or industrial use. Where our shop is, you can't even drive two cars side by side on the road, because there is such a lack of parking that both sides of the road have parked cars. If there's a semi truck coming your way, you have to back up or get off the road. It's stupid and just makes businesses look for somewhere better."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,mjw11,3,Mon Apr 20 08:25:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think the issues you want to talk about and the issues I want to talk about are the same things.   I think this applies to basically anyone. Which is why i feel OP is reaching out.  I'd rather see emphasis on fixing traffic patterns and the way the roads work themselves, rather than ""fixing roads"""
VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,4,Mon Apr 20 09:24:56 2015 UTC,"If we're being realistic, there isn't much that can happen with traffic patterns, short of seeing what can be done with one way streets. Victoria is old enough that there are no road easements, so expanding streets wider is generally not an option. I can't imagine there is the necessary money available to remove the three major restrictions on Highway 1 (Tillicum, McKenzie, AND the West Shore Parkway ALL have to be overpassed to even think about it working).  Also, in my opinion, the Pat Bay and Highway One need to be joined at Uptown for free-flow. Again, I can't imagine that there will ever be money for that sort of work, considering it would virtually shut down traffic flow for a year or more to build it.  A great deal can be done by allowing a transit hub, which currently doesn't exist, and by allowing or building multi-storey parking. Removing cars from street parking would go a long way to opening up other transit routes."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,3,Mon Apr 20 09:40:26 2015 UTC,"Removing cars from street parking would go a long way to opening up other transit routes.   Which is one example of what I mean by, fixing the traffic flow/patterns."
VictoriaBC,337g3m,Notnoodles,0,Mon Apr 20 10:14:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not the one setting the questions. The meeting is specifically about economic development. That said, many of the things that people are mentioning are subtly tied to economic development; fixing the homeless problem will make people more likely to go out at night, fixing road systems will make it easier for people to come downtown for work, food or shopping."

VictoriaBC,333vlx,greatestape,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:58:07 2015 UTC,Just call Telus. That sounds like a mistake.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,open_water,2,Mon Apr 20 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's not. The Telus' Internet 15 package (internet only) is $63 a month, without tax, once the introductory rate goes away, but yeah I still really need to call and try to haggle them down."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,kingbuns2,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:45:31 2015 UTC,These Juce internet prices have no contract and come with unlimited bandwidth.  The offers from Shaw or Telus lock you in for years and they have introductory 6 month prices which then usually double in price after the 6 months are up.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,B1ackmath,4,Tue Apr 21 00:30:01 2015 UTC,Shaw doesn't have contracts.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,kingbuns2,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:41:54 2015 UTC,They do have the 6 month thing though.

VictoriaBC,333vlx,thetrivialstuff,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:29:30 2015 UTC,Also the fact that it only goes to 3 up with the $80 plan :/ Is that just a Canadian thing or what?    Pretty much. The infrastructure just isn't there to get higher uplink speed than this; in practice you'll only see 512K up on a lot of residential connections in this area anyway.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,3,Mon Apr 20 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"The infrastructure just isn't there to get higher uplink speed than this   Bullshit. The infrastructure is there. If it wasn't basicly a monopoly between shaw and telus, and they had actually competition they could easily boost speeds."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,thetrivialstuff,3,Sun Apr 19 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"I guess what I should've said is, ""the infrastructure is in the hands of people who don't want to do anything about it and there's no easy way to make them get out of the way so anyone else can make use of it"" :P  Shaw and Telus own the only bits of wire that go to all the houses. They also own a lot of the right-of-way that you would need access to even if you had enough money to string your own bits of wire or fibre. So effectively, the infrastructure is blocked."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,2,Sun Apr 19 21:36:23 2015 UTC,Oh okay. I thought you were talking about shaw and telus' infrastructure. So I guess you were right in regards to the infastructure for non-telus/shaw providers.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"They aren't upgrading infastructure when you upgrade from lets say a 25Mbs plan to a 100Mbs plan. That says the infastructure is there. If they had real competition they would be forced to lower prices or upgrade to fiber (simple economics).  Edit: The lack of upload speed is an artificial bottleneck set by ISP's. If they needed/wanted to, they could unlock cap so easily. Copper isn't that slow."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,thetrivialstuff,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"It's not a pricing conspiracy. It's simple economics.    I work in the industry, and it basically is a pricing conspiracy. It does not cost $70/month or even $30/month to provide 25 mbit Internet service to a house. With current levels of technology, in a large city, this should cost around $10-15/month for the consumer, if that.  For comparison, in England landline phone service + 14 Mbit unmetered Internet costs the equivalent of $4/month Canadian. They have a much smaller country, but there's no way that makes up for a $50/month price difference, especially not in cities where the service area (i.e. houses you can reach from a central office) is the same."

We have two providers and I pay $10usd/month (including tax) for unlimited fiber with no contracts or screwing around with modems or other archaic hardware.   I have an ethernet jack in my living room.   The other provider chargers the same.   Both provide free WiFi access (spotty) throughout my city free of charge.  The only other thing I pay for is about 80 cents a month for DNS service for US Netflix and PS4 US store access.
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,3,Wed Apr 22 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"We have two providers and I pay $10usd/month (including tax)   Heres the difference between your service, and our service.

When I lived in BC I still needed hardware from Shaw installed in my house to provide me with Internet access.  How is this still a thing (and I lived at The Juliet, a relatively new complex)?  Here, I can plug in a $20 router from any manufacturer into the wall and I'm done, there is nothing else. No other hardware or the need for an installer.  I am incredibly surprised the CRTC is still allowing all of this to happen.  $80 for access with limits and caps? That's borderline criminal."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:45:10 2015 UTC,"I can plug in a $20 router from any manufacturer into the wall and I'm done, there is nothing else. No other hardware or the need for an installer   You can do that here. You don't need to go with the router from the ISP. Seriously, there's nothing worse than the uninformed. All connect is a modem and you have a connection. Shaw installing it is just ease of use to customers who have know knowledge of what a modem or a router (two different things) does   Shaw installed in my house   Which all they are doing are plugging in a power cord and the data connection.   $80 for access with limits and caps?   If you think that's bad, look at Australia.   Edit: Ill add that:   Why does every house or condo still need a stupid cable modem?   The modem converts the digital signals thru ethernet to analog thru copper/telephone wire. That router you plug into your wall has a built in modem, or else it wouldn't function. The modems provided by shaw also have a built in router in them as well.  If you were running fiber there would be a similar modem which would convert it into a signal that is transferable thru fiber."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,intromatt,2,Mon Apr 20 08:52:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you for the info.  Weirdly, I don't have a modem but only a Linksys router plugged into a wall (power and ethernet)."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:33:57 2015 UTC,"You're Linksys router should either have a built in modem or you have one built into your home. The ethernet connection suggests its preinstalled in your home, since you can't go from copper to ethernet without a modem."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,intromatt,2,Mon Apr 20 10:11:24 2015 UTC,"I live in a condo and my router is a WRT1900AC.  Other than my computers and tablet, I have no other hardware.  There must be something inside the whole building, I know there is a fiber connection going into a big box on the first floor.  I don't know how the rest works."
VictoriaBC,333vlx,james121345,2,Mon Apr 20 10:25:59 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference when you live in a condo as well. The fiber connection gets converted to a signal that can be transfered thru ethernet. The signal then goes to your router which then deals with all your traffic. Your router as well has a wireless access point built in, allowing for wireless internet.  There is also a highly probable chance the owner of the condo building has a deal with the two providers to give essentially an exclusive bulk discount."

VictoriaBC,333vlx,wrgrant,2,Mon Apr 20 10:46:41 2015 UTC,"Its important to note that you have to keep your existing Internet connection through Shaw until after you get them to connect. It will likely be a guy from Shaw who does your install in fact. Then you can  cancel your Shaw connection a few days later. I guess they need the existing system in place to do the install.  Also they only take Credit Cards for payment at the moment, and they want 2 months in advance at the start - so they can avoid problems with missed payments. Its likely going to cost you around $100 to get the installation and their router in place.   However the savings sound like they will be worth it. I expect that I can save around $20 per month for the same service I am receiving at the moment (based on just having done some speedtests on the Internet of my existing connection). So save $240 per year for an initial outlay of $100 or so seems worth it overall."

(taxes included) I have a modem so basically it cost me the same as one month service from shaw for my transfer and month of service, and my speeds are going to be much better."

To be honest I've never hit my data cap with shaw and I pay about the same price, and with them I can at least take advantage of the loyalty department to waive install fees and whatnot.    I'm all for introducing competition into the market but it seems like Juce's biggest selling point is only no data caps. ""Unfiltered"", ""Unthrottled"" and ""Unrestricted"" are pretty meaningless in my opinion.   EDIT: The privacy aspect is nice but I feel like ISPs' role in surveillance is pretty minimal compared to all the other threats to internet/browsing privacy."

Also its not throttled ive tested it and at least mine isent and the lowest ive seen it drop to is 96. And thats all for less than the 50mbps plan from Juce. mine is 60 a month.

[edit] Sorry, I didn't see your description in reply to the deleted comment. Residue sounds like pollen, especially if it's light yellow. Where on the tree the pine needles are turning pale and brown will help a lot with diagnosis - is it on branches closest to the top or bottom? Just the ends of the branches or closest to the base of the tree? This is the kind of information you'll want to bring to a clinic - even a picture if you're uncertain of your ability to provide the information that will help make a good diagnosis.   Nasty fungi or parasites rarely severely affect more than one species, though there are some notable exceptions. It is very likely that whatever is impacting your pines (if it isn't just straight up drought) isn't the same thing that's affecting your maples.  An arborist may be able to help you out, but another great resource is the Master Gardener's Clinics - they won't try to sell you anything, and will have the knowledge or be able to do effective research for you.

VictoriaBC,32tvc0,Decapentaplegia,6,Thu Apr 16 17:51:54 2015 UTC,Good on you mate. One survey/study I really like is this one. GMO's are the divisive topic with regards to scientists vs the general public. 37% of the public vs 88% of  scientists.  I don't even want to know what the public opinion would be on this topic in Victoria. The scientific illiteracy amongst some groups here is astounding.
VictoriaBC,32tvc0,dibadiba,11,Sun Apr 19 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"I firmly support the right to protest, but I believe such protests need to operate on a maxim of education and raising awareness with an open mind to both sides of the debate.   Below is a transcript of my discussion with the organizer of this protest. Several times she makes it clear that she does not want to consider opposing viewpoints. I'll admit that I am poking the bear, especially in the last two emails. Still, I don't feel as though she responded appropriately.  http://imgur.com/VnbSbxN  EDIT: while I was stitching those snips together, looks like one of my emails has the same two paragraphs twice."
VictoriaBC,32tvc0,Notnoodles,-13,Fri Apr 17 17:47:45 2015 UTC,Not all debates deserve another side. Some times there is a right and wrong side to a particular issue. Monsanto has a large hand in the decimation of the worlds honey bees.  http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/aug/08/sweet-victory-beekeepers-monsanto-gm-soybeans http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/15/us-usda-honeybees-report-idUSKBN0DV12120140515
VictoriaBC,32tvc0,Iamonabike,8,Fri Apr 17 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Every debate deserves to hear both sides. Let's talk about the bees... the world's bees aren't dying off (at unprecedented rates). Articles that talk about ""beepocalypse"" are nothing but misinformed fear-mongering (albeit this is a complex issue).  While some species of bees are a very important part of the global ecosystem, reports on the topic of colony collapse disorder (CCD) often do not reflect the scientific evidence. Bee die-offs are the result of complex factors, and I highly encourage anyone very interested in the subject to listen to this podcast.  That said, here are some salient quotes if you don't want to listen to or read all that much. Understanding this issue has critical implications for sustainable agriculture; recent misguided protests by the public leading to bans by governmental bodies highlight the need for clear and accurate discussions among even laymen.  tl;dr: Bee populations are increasing, neonics are not a major issue, GM crops/glyphosate is not an issue. Varroa mites and poor nutrition are the major contributing factors to bee die-offs, which are occurring at more or less the same rate they always have.  ""...data collected by the crop protection industry from the USDA, FAO and StatisticsCanada shows that bee populations even in intensely farmed areas of the world are increasing rather than rapidly decreasing... [in the US] bee population is up nearly 13 percent since 2008... The world’s bee population has been rising almost continuously for the past 50 years""  ""…there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents.""  ""the most likely encountered high range of field doses [of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid] relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines.""  ""the total number of beehives today is higher than it was in 1995 when neonics as they are often called had just come on the market... scientists now believe [CCD] was a short-lived phenomenon that has occurred numerous times over the past few centuries... Even at the highest dose of pesticide exposure, [USDA] researchers found no difference in the performance of the treated and untreated hives. They found no evidence that imidacloprid affected foraging activity during and after exposure in their experiments... In Europe, where neonics were banned 15 months ago after a ferocious lobbying campaign by activists, farmers have begun replacing them with older pesticides phased out years ago precisely because they caused too much collateral damage. So the panic solution—an open-ended moratorium on the use of neonics—has actually led to increased bee deaths."""

I'm convinced that Monsanto is no worse than DuPont, Syngenta, Bayer, etc; in fact they are rather charitable especially towards farmers in developing nations. I could absolutely be wrong about this, but I've yet to see solid evidence of Monsanto being any worse than any company - in fact, I think Whole Foods is more ""evil"".

So procedures should exist to keep anyone from letting their curiosity get the best of them.  Maybe good checks already exist, and these people went above and beyond to snoop. But if it's just ""type in person A's name and see everything about them""...that's something no person in any position should be able to do...  I find this so disconcerting.

They might think that they are a good enough person to not judge the other person for their health records, so that it's okay for them...  I guess, though, that I don't know what information it is that they even wanted. But I'm not in healthcare...maybe they just find blood test results interesting, or something. I really don't know.  Either way, it's totally inexcusable and a total manipulation of power."

Strange how, when we upgraded to a bundle deal of TV, phone and Internet for only $10 more than our regular bill, for six months, our Internet worked pretty much perfectly.

VictoriaBC,32rdp7,TheDiesel28,3,Thu Apr 16 02:30:50 2015 UTC,"A new one is opening on Quadra just near the North Park bike shop. It's around the corner from me and we've been wondering what's going into the empty storefront, hoping for a coffee shop or something nice but joking that it'd be another dispensary... Because my neighbourhood really needs a fourth (fifth?) dispensary. Anyway, saw the sign today, it's a dispensary."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,ninethreeseven,4,Thu Apr 16 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"yeah i've noticed this too, there are a ton of new ones even in the downtown core. i found it funny when it took months for the police to bust the one beside the old pizza zone on quadra, you just had to make some bullshit excuse and the dude would laminate your card in front of you. all the weed in the world and they were literally a block away from the station. was a prime example of how the police are limited by the glacial flow of the legal system."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,nrtphotos,16,Thu Apr 16 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"Or maybe the police just had better things to do. It would be downright shameful if someone got hurt because the police were too busy confiscating weed from a dispensary that had been operating without much incident for months. It's a waste of limited resources that could be used to keep people safe, or at the very least prevent or investigate property-related crimes, anything where there's an actual victim.  Shut them down for evading taxes or skirting labor laws or violating health codes, but I'm perfectly fine if the police decide to take their sweet time busting marijuana shops for nothing more than distribution."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,EnsignRedshirt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:39:22 2015 UTC,Yea they literally told them to move to an area that wasn't so family friendly.
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,ninjatune,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"There are about a dozen. Some of them are seedier than others.   Medical marijuana is a tough area because it does provide relief to so many people who can't access it any other way. Unfortunately most of the dispensaries are frequented by stoners with no license, and that makes it uncomfortable for seniors and sick people. The one on the corner of Rock Bay & Gorge is actually doing things right - I wish more of them could set a good example like that."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,paradigm5H1F7,3,Thu Apr 16 04:37:12 2015 UTC,i was under the impression that the only way you can get LEGAL medical marijuana was through a mail order? i could be wrong though.
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,nrtphotos,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"This is correct,  but there's some current challenges to the law that are working their way through the courts that seem to make the police hesitant to enforce the laws for some reason.  I'm all for legalization, but I really dislike the move to the california model where I have to lie to a doctor and have a false medical condition documented so I can buy weed at a store.  Also I noticed while leaving castle today that the Dank Bank has again rebranded to Trees    Reddit seems to be leaking into the real world again."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,FredThe12th,4,Thu Apr 16 05:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yes you're correct. Delivery services sell out within a few hours, forcing 60% of license holders to wait up to 3 months for a new shipment.  That's the challenge.  Constitutionally as of 2011, users with a medical need are allowed to use marijuana - similar to how you can choose Chinese medicine over Western medicine - it's your right.  This is what causes a legal grey area - dispensaries are providing a need where the government has failed, and the police know this. As soon as the marijuana is in the hands of a person with a license to possess, it's legal.   As you alluded - it'll be legalized within a few years any way. If President Obama can have 2 ounces in the White House, Denver tech companies can offer programmers rooms with hvacs to smoke while coding, and it's 100% legal just a few leagues away from us... how can BC be far behind.  Anyone who has an issue with marijuana, please reference alcohol as a benchmark - and let me know if you support prohibition too.  Would love to know why I got downvoted earlier, I know quite a bit about this because I know people who actually use medical marijuana, and it has saved them from so many horrible prescription drugs that couldn't help them in the same way."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,paradigm5H1F7,3,Thu Apr 16 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"how can BC be far behind.   The difference is that in Canada, provinces don't get to set their own constitutions like states in the USA have to make it legal.  Therefore the only way it'll ever happen here is if it happens federally, which will be never as long as the conservatives are still in power."
VictoriaBC,32rdp7,Great68,-2,Thu Apr 16 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that many (all?)  of the new dispensaries in town are selling to people without a license, hence the goofy forms they have for download on their websites to go get someone to fill out.  Anecdotal evidence seems to show me that more and more people who used to be recreational users are now talking about their medicine   which just seems to be a way to access the weed store.    I really worry that legalization will slow down by this.     I'm also sick of having to have the same conversations with tenants ""I don't give a shit if it's medicine or not,  you are making the hallways stink of weed and your neighbours don't appreciate it,  stop it""  Yes it has legitimate medical uses,  but it's getting extended a lot beyond what the law allows.    I have no problem with legitimate medical uses, or recreational use, but confounding the two is not great.       I mean I'd be more focused  and have more energy at work if I could go down to the local adderall compassion club and get some amphetamines.  I'll bring a note from a ND or Dr of TCM stating that I've used it and found it provides relief to my symptoms  would be required, that's should be enough."

You will have to configure it yourself but its very easy. I think it costs us around $100 a year or so. This also lets you set up your own email addresses, email forwarders, message boards, wiki, etc. They will do domain name registration for you as well (another $20 per year for a .ca address, more for a .com/.net/.org of course) and you can set up subdomains if needed as well."

District (club 919) has live music sometimes, but primarily it's a nightclub (lucky bar could be in this category, i'll admit i've only gone twice).  What venues do you think got left out?

Sort of just mentions those in passing. Obviously the article isn't written by someone in the electronic scene so that's probably not their main focus, but the scene here is really big, much larger than one might expect for a place the size of Vic.  So far this year we've had A Skillz, Zed's Dead, Longwalk Shortdalk, Excision, Datsik, Metrik (and more) and later this month Dieselboy. Not to mention Netsky & Kissy Sell-Out that came here just a few months ago.  There are a ton of local DJ's that contribute to a very vibrant and diverse dance music scene.  As for the rest of the article I can't really comment because I haven't heard of any of those bands hahaha :)  Edit: Also I should mention I think it is great that someone took the time to write the article ;)"

VictoriaBC,32n87q,Incompatibert,7,Wed Apr 15 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"And then, even if you somehow manage to do it, there has to have been a chance for them to get onto the shoulder if not U-turn.

If it's a signature witnessed, you're looking for someone who is a designated ""Commissioner for taking Oaths in the Province of British Columbia"". The courthouse has at least one or two on staff and they do it for no cost. These guys can't make make notarized/certified copies of documents but they are able to witness your signature in an ""official"" capacity.  I don't know what part of town you are in but downtown there are some firms who do it for free (it's considered a goodwill thing, they hope if you need legal help later you'll come to them) and there's at least one law firm in Bastion Square (can't remember the name but they are near Darcys and the Maritime Museum) who do it by donation, they donate the money to sponsor a family at xmas."

VictoriaBC,32mg09,thetrivialstuff,2,Wed Apr 15 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"Depending on what it's for, also consider the place you need the notarized document for. A lot of government departments will trust their own staff to make authentic copies of documents. For example, every time I've gotten a passport renewal, I go to the passport office with my originals and let the counter staff make the photocopies.  Same deal when I had to send a ""notarized photocopy"" of my birth certificate to Service Canada -- I walked into the office here, gave them my original to photocopy, they did it, handed me back the original, put an official ""copied in our office"" stamp on the copy and used their inter-office mail system to forward that copy to their Ottawa office where my case file was.  This completely bypasses the need for notarization, because they've handled the originals, and they trust their internal filing system."

VictoriaBC,32iyub,samaritansays,20,Tue Apr 14 04:07:19 2015 UTC,"Gulf islander here, been heating with wood all my life, so I can't offer much on the wood vs. electricity front, and I get my own, so no use on suppliers.  But for the ""Any other advice"",  here goes:  First off, if you are trying to reduce heating bills, seal your doors and windows.  Vinyl spring-loaded door seals are cheap and easy to install.  Sealant around the outside of the inside trim if there is a gap between that and the wall.  Any room that is colder on a windy day, but not so bad on a calm day, can really benefit from this. If you can see any daylight at all from any angle around your door you need this.  Next, arbutus is best, fir is next best, maple is OK but not as good as fir, and alder is not good.  But cheap dry alder will still keep you warm.  Garry Oak is awesome, but very hard to get and kind of illegal.  Yew is incredible but unless you regularly cruise old-growth clear cuts you aren't getting any. Cedar is great for hot and quick heat / kindling but terrible for long-term heat.  Even alder is better. Also old-growth fir is much better than second growth.  2 or 3 growth rings per cm? second growth.  10 or more per cm? really good old growth. Those prices sound OK, but late winter / early spring can be a bad time to buy wood, as folks who haven't laid in enough.  I sometimes sell a surplus this time of year, ask for $400, and get it.  If you can store your wood for an extra year in a dry place it will burn way better. Even a little moisture in wood can make it much less efficient. If it feels at all wet to the touch, bargain it down and burn it next year.  If you can let it dry in the sun all summer, it will be awesome in the winter.  If you store it in a moist place, it will soak up the moisture.  My woodshed has lots of ventilation and a big skylight for passive solar heating / dry air. Seasoned wood from a supplier just means that it's not soaking wet or totally green.  A stacked cord has 30 to 50 % more wood than a jumbled cord.  For free wood: get yourself a cheap little electric chainsaw ($50 to 100) and keep your eyes open. Become a wood hound. Anything thicker than an inch is worth burning.  Doug fir branches are pound for pound the best firewood on the tree. And don't burn driftwood, the salt will rot your stovepipes.  A little cedar kindling from the beach is fine. The big problem with any chainsaw is sharpening.  It's not hard unless you've been cutting dirt. Never let a chain touch dirt.  Burning it:  Burn it hot, in smaller pieces.  Only burn bigger pieces for overnight burns, and make sure the whole log is burning well before you shut the stove down.  You'll have to load more often, but you'll get more heat.  You'll have to find locals for your first two questions."

VictoriaBC,32iyub,Notnoodles,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you so much for all your advice. This is a big help.

VictoriaBC,32iyub,sprocket,2,Wed Apr 15 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"That's a reasonable price for a cord of fir.    We heat 95% of the year with just wood, only turning on the oil furnace when temperatures really take a sustained sub-zero dip.  We live in an old house (built in the early 1900's) with terrible insulation, and usually budget about 3 cords for a winter.  We start burning early October and aim to finish by mid-April."
VictoriaBC,32iyub,sprocket,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:51:04 2015 UTC,When do you find is the best time to buy? What questions should I ask my supplier?   Thanks for the advice.
VictoriaBC,32iyub,ninethreeseven,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"In our area (we're up in the Cowichan Valley), I don't see too much variation in prices throughout the year.  I believe there are some times that some of the firewood guys aren't permitted to operate in the wood lots (I'm unclear if that's because of a perceived fire hazard or because they're being worked by the logging companies.), so you may want to check when you're able to purchase from whomever you're going with.  We're probably going to get another couple cords in the next month or so to put away over the summer, so that it's had time to further dry out by fall.  I'd ask questions along the lines of:   How long the wood has been cut and split and how it has been stored. Some places can have wood cut to a length to fit in your stove, and can split into large/medium/small pieces. It's not a bad idea once the wood is stacked to measure things up and ensure you actually received a cord of wood.  Some places, should you come up short, will fix that problem for you by bringing more wood in.   It'd also be really nice to get a bit of cedar in with your fir or whatever sort you'll be burning.

I do scrounge up some easy wood now and again, but the bulk of our is split and delivered to us."
VictoriaBC,32iyub,Notnoodles,3,Fri Apr 17 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"environmentally burning wood is generally not great and is slowly being banned in bigger cities to reduce smog / increase air quality.  I doubt it will be banned in Victoria in the next 10 years so you're probably good on that front.  It is sad that they banned having firepits outdoors for the environmental issues :(   If you have a wood stove its pretty good for keeping you warm, shouldn't have any issues keeping all 1200 square feet warm.  In my experience if you wanted to heat your bedroom with the wood stove you could, but the room the wood stove is in would be quite uncomfortably warm."

Car 87 – Mental Health Car  Car 87 teams a Vancouver Police constable with a registered nurse or a registered psychiatric nurse to provide on-site assessments and intervention for people with psychiatric problems. The nurse and the police officer work as a team in assessing, managing and deciding about the most appropriate action.  The Car 87 program is a partnership between the Vancouver Police Department and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority – Mental Health Emergency Services (MHES). The MHES / Car 87 program started on a trial basis in 1984 and was formalized in 1987. In 2002, MHES logged approximately 13,000 calls and conducted approximately 1,850 outreach calls which resulted in 382 hospitalizations.  In addition to Car 87, MHES operates a telephone crisis line where nurses assist callers in crisis, provide information pertaining to resources and triage situations to the appropriate resources: Car 87, ambulance or police as required.  Car 87 can be reached via the Mental Health Emergency Services (MHES) 24-hour crisis line at (604) 874-7307 or via 911."

They are also somewhat full of shit in their descriptions of the programs.  They're still teaching Macromedia Flash and suggest that it's the 'industry leading authoring environment' when it's been depreciated for years, for example.  Their website is full of fallacies such as that.    You will have far better luck getting trade certification in a recognizable field and taking technology on the side in some form of self directed learning situation (MIT offers hundreds of courses freely online, for instance).  James, who's responded in this thread, is exactly right... your own proven and demonstrated skills are far more valuable than is a certification from a school which may not be around in 5 years.  If you want to work in the web design world, for instance, start making websites that show off technical skills; have a few database schema to demonstrate, show off some apps you've made, etc etc.  These are far more likely to get you hired than is a certificate from a school that no-one's heard of.    source : I got top marks at CDI college for novell networking and an MSCE, the best job offer I got was from CDI college to teach the course I'd just finished.  Was taught almost exclusively by previous graduates.  I now do quite well in a completely unrelated field."

Personally, I'm a software developer who learnt his trade through self-study. About three years ago I was scrubbing toilets. Today I help to manage a well-known international software development firm and make about ~150k/year. What got me from there to here is a passion for technology and software development, and a willingness to spend many hours studying on my own. And of course spend many more hours toiling away on complicated projects for crappy pay, to increase my experience in a number of areas.  Not saying I have some sort of trick to being successful.

I've chosen to work in a different field where I have no certifications, I've done all my learning online, and I have more freedom, fulfillment and profit potential than if I was practicing as a licensed professional engineer.

I often see the issue where the lane is not quite wide enough for cars to pass cyclists safely (there is no shoulder or bike lane), but the cars are going quite fast because it is a main road, cars can often pass way too close to cyclists because they didn't want to slow down and move over to the next lane. If cars were driving slower and were less impatient in this case they would have more time to give the cyclists proper passing room. I don't know how much lowering the speed limit would help this though. I think a better solution would be proper bike infrastructure, but that costs a lot more money than a few speed limit changes  Often silly low speed limits in areas where it is safe to go faster can be abused by law enforcement as a cash grab.

VictoriaBC,328r24,Lord_Rat,7,Tue Apr 14 01:21:34 2015 UTC,".  The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), the international association that represents traffic engineers, transportation planners and similar professionals who plan and design roads and neighborhoods, has defined traffic calming as the installation of measures designed ""to reduce traffic speeds and/or cut-through volumes, in the interest of street safety, livability, and other public purposes.""  Traffic calming is the installation of safety solutions such as radar speed signs or speed humps to slow or reduce traffic in order to enhance safety for pedestrians and motorists. Already used effectively in Europe for decades, traffic calming is becoming more and more popular in communities throughout North America. It is the most effective way to reduce speeding on residential streets, avoid traffic accidents and prevent fatalities. Traffic calming programs begin either with the vision of progressive municipalities, with the knowledge of traffic engineers or public works officials, or at the request of concerned residents.  Preventing accidents, improving life  The purpose of traffic calming is to make neighborhoods safer, more pleasant, and more livable. Reducing the speed and volume of traffic to acceptable levels helps to achieve these goals. Traffic calming reduces accidents, collisions, noise, vibration, pollution, and crime.  Over decades of use, traffic calming solutions have proven to reduce both the number and severity of pedestrian crashes. Traffic calming measures such as ""Your Speed"" radar signs and dynamic messaging radar speed signs alert drivers to the speed they are driving at while reminding them of the posted speed limit. They have been shown to exert positive changes in driver behavior even over an extended period of time. Physical solutions, such as speed tables or speed humps, compel drivers to slow down to speeds at which they are better able to react to unexpected situations such as a child darting across the street.  Slower cars do save lives  In the event that a crash does occur, lower speeds significantly lower the probability of a fatality or serious injury. Each 1 mph reduction in traffic speed reduces vehicle collisions by 5% and fatalities by more than 5%. A driver travelling at 40 mph who sees a pedestrian 100 feet ahead will be traveling 38 mph on impact. If a driver was instead driving at 25 mph, he would have enough time to stop before ever reaching the pedestrian. Slowing traffic saves lives. Traffic calming measures have been called ""the only antidote for the malady of child pedestrian accidents."" (Transportation Alternatives Magazine)  Solution types  In recent years traffic calming has become increasingly popular in North America. Radar speed signs are a versatile solution used in a variety of situations and environments such as residential streets, private communities, industrial settings, and military bases. Rubber traffic calming solutions are often used in place of asphalt speed humps or speed cushions as a more visible, easier to transport, and often cost-effective alternative. They are an aesthetically pleasing way to slow vehicles while the premolded shape encourages driver acceptance.

You can also learn more about specific calming measures at the Federal Highway Administration's traffic calming section. http://trafficlogix.com/trafficcalming/trafficcalming  .  Speed Relation to Travel Time, Pedestrian Death  .   canadianrastafarian: I would ask this: Is there any actual EVIDENCE that lowering the speed limits creates a safer community? If yes, provide sources.    Ontario coroner urges city speed limits be cut to 40 km/h when not otherwise posted - Link to Coroner's Report at bottom of article In a 2010 study conducted by the Deputy Chief Coroner of Ontario, Dr. Bert Lauwers, said that speed kills, and it is an inescapable fact, citing that statistics show a pedestrian struck by a vehicle travelling 50 km/hr is FIVE TIMES more likely to die than if struck at 30 km/hr. “The data are irrefutable. The higher the rate of speed at which a pedestrian is struck, the greater the chance of death.” Vehicle Travel Speeds and The Incidence of Fatal Pedestrian Collisions – NHMRC Road Accident Research Unite – The University of Adelaide The Finish study found that by lowering the speed limit to 30 km/hr on residential streets, COMBINED with effective speed camera enforcement, would reduce the pedestrian accident costs by 70 percent. The report concludes that 30km/hr in residential communities combined with speed-camera enforcement is the “cheapest and only quick measure to strongly reduce the number of serious pedestrian accidents in wide urban areas.” – source: Helsinki City Planning Department Traffic Planning Division.pdf) Graph from Helsinki Study: Speed relation to travel time, pedestrian death Pedestrian Death – Pedestrian Injury Severity and Impact Speed U. S. Department of Transportation  – National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Traffic / Pedestrian Fatality Review A report published by the United States Department of Transportation in October of 1999, stated that its findings were similar to what was determined by a UK report, which are as follows. • 20 mph (32 km per hour) impact speeds: 5 percent death, 65 percent injured, and 30 percent uninjured • 30 mph (48 km per hour) impact speeds: 45 percent death, 50 percent injured, and 5 percent uninjured • 40 mph (64 km per hour) impact speeds: 85 percent death and 15 percent injured.

E.g. NS recently dropped some speed limits in school zones to 30km/h when children are present. In this instance it feels very uncomfortable to drive 30km/h on a main highway (where many elementary schools are). There is a lot of tire screeching and aggressive driving after motorists get out of the zones, as might be the case from drivers exiting a 40km/h road and entering one with a higher speed limit.  I would be in favour of all dead end streets having 30-40km/h speed limits, but if care is not taken to ensure that through-streets still have a reasonable speed limit then I would expect this to be a very frustrating change."

Your source lacks to mention the correlation between what was solely over speed, solely dry conditions and solely because of dark clothing. How many over speed accidents resulted in minor injuries/major injuries/ fatal injuries?   What about the 40 percent of accidents who were speeding. How many of those could've prevented death by having been at a slower speed? How many could've been prevented completely? How many were speeding in wet conditions?   You can't source 3 relations betwen the data and say you know the bigger picture."

VictoriaBC,328r24,mikeball,-3,Mon Apr 13 06:14:38 2015 UTC,"One more:  ""According to B.C. Coroner statistics, since January 1, 2006, in Victoria proper, there were no pedestrian or cyclist deaths on residential roads. The limited study did not consider morbidity, which could decrease if the speed is reduced. Reduced speed limits will result in more cyclists and more cyclists could result in less crashes."""
VictoriaBC,328r24,slackshack,-2,Mon Apr 13 06:08:56 2015 UTC,That limitation shows me that more in depth study needs to be done to see the bigger picture.

VictoriaBC,328r24,slobarnuts,0,Tue Apr 14 01:25:37 2015 UTC,"That assumes constant speed for the whole trip. In reality, traffic and traffic lights exist and further increase these times. My commute is 12km, but it takes 30mins usually. This would be made much worse if every drove at 80% of their current speed."
VictoriaBC,328r24,VicVine,3,Tue Apr 14 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"So I basically typed out a massive explanation and then chrome crashed. So ill try to redo it as best i can.  There is a reason it assumes constant speed. Because speed is the independent variable here. Not frequency of lights, length of time you wait at them, traffic density/patterns. If you travel a trip twice - and you are waiting in traffic/at a light the same amount of time for both trips, but travel slower during one than the other. The independent variable is the speed at which you are travelling at. If you make the same trip twice again, but travel at the same speed, and wait at lights for a different amount of time than the independent variable is the time at which you wait in traffic.  If your 12km commute take 30 mins usually. Hypothetically if the speed at which you are in movement for your entire trip is 70km/h. You travelling for 10.2 mins and waiting for 19.8 minutes. Now lets say you travel that same trip at 50km/h, and wait at the same lights for the same time.You are now travelling for 14.4 minutes and waiting for 19.8, which gives a total travel time of 34.2 minutes.  Difference of 4.2 minutes between trips. This difference is negligible because you may wait more/ or wait less at lights. The difference from speed alone is very minor, in comparison to the overall trip; it only adds 14% time to the trip.  This 14% is a large amount of time if you are already travelling for a large amount of time. However, if you are travelling a smaller amount of time - the added time to the trip is significantly less.  Edit: Typos"

I wouldn't say the redneck stigma is gone, there are many MANY very narrow-minded, selfish dimwits we meet almost daily and if you are a person who cares to follow rules(such as bylaws) and expect the same from your fellow citizens, don't move here. Dogs are everywhere, most often unleashed, and use the entire town as their toilet, including kids playgrounds and all the other places where they are not supposed to be(the signs are everywhere, nobody cares). The Ruth King Elementary(which we unfortunately live close to) school's soccer fields and playground looks like a garbage dump and despite of the complaints, nothing is being done to improve it. The crime rate is going up and I don't like that Devil's Army has just opened a clubhouse here in Langford very much either.

I neither bus nor drive a Prius, nor do I feel there is an ""epidemic"" of cellphone use while driving.  I feel like road rage is a decently big problem here, and pickup truck drivers seem to exhibit the worst traits of all drivers on the road - coming from the fact that they have a big truck to use to their advantage, and a blue collar attitude.

VictoriaBC,324wba,pilo90r,15,Fri Apr 10 16:35:25 2015 UTC,My unhelpful input: Victoria public transport sucks. Buses are rarely on time I find.
VictoriaBC,324wba,Wraith978,2,Fri Apr 10 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. But I take the 27x in the morning and usually the 27 or 28x in the afternoon and they are almost always on time (maybe because a lot of work people rely on them so they have to be?), but this has been unusual. In fact, the driver changes at my stop and the driver is always waiting too and he is trying to get on the 28 and the 28 bus driver says it's not his bus. So the new driver is confused as well!"
VictoriaBC,324wba,threelinestory,6,Fri Apr 10 20:45:45 2015 UTC,Is a new schedule in effect?
VictoriaBC,324wba,Reeve1,6,Fri Apr 10 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, routes changed to the summer schedule on April 6th so that is probably the answer."
VictoriaBC,324wba,skeletonwar,0,Fri Apr 10 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"No, its not a service change. Service change for the 27 and 28 are rarely to never affected as they are not affected by seasonal changes (school being out etc.).   Edit: As far as my research goes..."
VictoriaBC,324wba,jdrr22,3,Fri Apr 10 20:41:12 2015 UTC,"You could try phoning BC Transit and asking? I find the 27, 28, 28x to be packed with people after school is out so maybe that's why. Also I think summer bus schedule may have began so maybe that affected it?"
VictoriaBC,324wba,jdrr22,2,Fri Apr 10 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks. If it doesn't come today, I will call them.  To my knoweldge, the 27 and 28 routes have no service change with the new schedule.   Normally, the 28x at 4:10 Johnson @ Douglas isn't overly packed. There aren't many stops and its usually just taking work people home. Not sure!"
VictoriaBC,324wba,kdeanna,2,Fri Apr 10 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"Regarding all buses and scheduling - keep in mind that, whoever is designing the schedule is building in small blocks of time for drivers to have their breaks.  However, these blocks of time do not account for the people actually using the routes, and things like, people asking questions, wheelchairs, strollers, scooters, etc. needing the ramps lowered, taking time to load on and off.  When this happens, and the driver gets to the end of the route, needing to take a break, bathroom or food, they have to take their breaks (I know I wouldn't be too happy if I were forced to work straight through my shift without a food or bathroom break!)... and sometimes, they are so far behind, they have to call in to transit, and the bus then gets pulled off the road.  Please, don't gripe to drivers about this kind of thing.  It's up to transit to get their shit straight and do a better job with creating the schedules!"
VictoriaBC,324wba,jimmyvic,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this!   Ya I just was wondering since the schedule says 4:10 at Johnson and Douglas and I have been taking it for a very long time. And now it comes at 4:20, every single day, with no explanation. Sooo I just found it bizarre!"
VictoriaBC,324wba,derekja,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Don't get me wrong, there are some very rude and angry drivers out there, and always have been (some that were road rage angry, getting off their buses at red lights to yell at drivers in their cars), doing whatever they want, but a lot of them are trying to do their best within a crappy schedule that doesn't seem to get any better, especially with the newest person working on it.  The drivers have the option of giving up their legally mandated breaks to keep riders happy, and some do, but sometimes, even doing that doesn't make up enough time.  If they are more than 20 minutes behind schedule, they get pulled off the road, or if the next bus is minutes behind them (that's why, if you take the #6, you'll see no bus for about 15 minutes, then three in a row - they are only scheduled about 8 minutes apart).  I have been riding the bus since I was in elementary school, and made friends with a couple of drivers, who went well above and beyond their jobs, and were really there for me and my family at times... but, I have also seen some really gross attitudes and behaviours (like shutting the back doors on my pregnant belly when I was only half out the doors, like closing the door before I was all the way on the bus, and catching my foot out the door... with the driver starting to drive with me stuck like that, etc.)...   I would, however, call transit, even though that's usually a pointless waste of time, and ask why this is happening on a consistent basis.  Sometimes, calling - or even making a complaint through the website - DOES get results.  I know of a couple of drivers that had to suffer re-training as a result of complaints I made (not enough over the years, but it's something) - I have a bus driver friend who hears of things when consequences are doled out, most of the time :)"

The Comox Valley bus system goes as far south as Fanny Bay, so you could take a private bus there and then jump on a public bus. I took the IslandLink bus as far as Buckley Bay one time. It transferred once, in Nanaimo, it wasn't a big deal.  Usedvictoria has rideshare listings, see if you can find something there."

However, if it's just the digital source files you are interested in, I would be happy to make them available to you on a by-donation basis. I loathe to ask for money at all, but I recently left my job to focus on art & design full-time, and to be honest I could really use the support :P Even just a couple of bucks would be greatly appreciated, and I will send the files as a .zip to your email address.  The poster measures 12x18 inches and looks great on high-gloss paper or in a frame, but you can probably get pretty good results on basic 11x17 tabloid paper on your home printer too.  Thanks again for all your positive feedback :)  EDIT: A few people have asked for a larger size, so for anyone thinking of picking up the digital files, I have since amended them to include 18x27 inch prints."

I love living on the Saanich Peninsula. I think it's worthwhile to consider anything between here and Sidney. Incidentally, there is a small ferry running between Brentwood Bay and Mill Bay.   I've also lived on Salt Spring, by the way. It's a great community. Very friendly. It's also not the only Gulf island too. If you're in to living on a small island, you could visit several before deciding."

No zoning concerns for the business, but we will need Internet access and a post office.  I'll be looking for work when we get there (massage/acupuncture) so there is also a question of getting a property somewhere like salt spring where I could potentially bike to ""downtown"" or whether I will have better prospects commuting farther (cobble hill) to victoria.  I'm commuting an hour right now, so it doesn't seem so bad, but still.  We're also artsy people, so there is a question of the arts community (and market) on salt spring vs the island proper.

(Read up on BC ferries gulf island)  -> If you want to actually run a hobby farm i would look on the Vancouver island proper and try and find something in the ALR (Agricultural Land Reserve) as you will get a.) property  b.) zoning and no NIMBY aspects to it c.) tax breaks due to farming.

You are going to spend a lot of time at the college working your butt off, so proper selection of housing is useful. Be aware that you are going to be moving to the university in 6 months, so your place should be accessible to both so you do not need to do a christmas move.  Look up bus routes using google maps for place you are looking at, as it can give you an idea of where is good to live. In general, the corridor between the college and the University is pretty good, and should be easy enough to get a ride with new friends if need be for late night study sessions."
VictoriaBC,31zfix,MrPrime,5,Thu Apr 9 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"As someone who went through the engineering program at UVic but did not bridge... damn I'm glad I did not have to do the bridge. Instead of doing the insanity method I spread my courses out and took an extra semester.   If you're going into a major that weeds out 3/4 of the students and you're not at the very top of the pack, may as well look for opportunities to lighten the load. It certainly payed off in the long run as I was able to learn subjects in greater depth, resulting in higher fulfillment and competence (and grades) than I would have gotten by rushing through in insanity mode.  A lot of brilliant students who start at UVic don't make it into 3rd year. Second year at UVic is brutal... and I expect they make the bridge even more brutal, so I definitely respect the students who go through it. If you get to the other side of the bridge, you've earned it and deserve to reap the spoils of your reward... which is to take even harder courses in 3rd year, surrounded by nerdy males. :-)  P.S. An insane course load may look impressive but a lighter course load with deeper learning wins in the end. If you can spread out your courses in 3rd year, you can have a more enriching experience and get better grades while others around you struggle to breath. Don't try to just skim by in 3rd year. If you're paying to spend years of your life learning stuff, you may as well learn it right."
VictoriaBC,31zfix,VicVine,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:31:21 2015 UTC,An insane course load may look impressive but a lighter course load with deeper learning wins in the end.

VictoriaBC,31zfix,HotterRod,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, in general. Some students who went straight into engineering already have a lot of practical knowledge (through work and hobbies), but most of the bridge students are superior in this area."

I am someone that isn't necessarily naturally smart, I work really hard for my 4.0 and thus have developed pretty good work ethic.  What do you think is the main factor in being successful in the bridge and in engineering?"
VictoriaBC,31zfix,MrPrime,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Its going to be hard. Thats about the only way to put it.  You do have an advantage in the fact that you have study habits. I didnt, I waltzed through my tech program and then worked for 2 years after the fact. That bit me hard. Make friends and work as teams, get your assignments done on time and make sure you understand things. Material comes fast, and you do not get time to study for finals. Classes end on Friday, first exam is that Saturday morning. Then you get another final every morning the following week. (6 Exam, 7 days). They front load the harder exams (Hard, hard, easy, hard, easy, easy, easy) so that you do okay when you burn out.  Thankfully, you do have lots of good resources to help you. Camosun offers the Math Help room for the bridge program, which is a dedicated math tutor for the program.  Your goal for the bridge is to pass things, they come in as completes on your transcripts, so gettings A's is not required.   Once at UVic, look at your schedule, and if 6 courses is going to be too much, drop some and do something that is manageable (talk with your academic advisor). I had better luck, and learned more things that I remember doing 4 courses than I did when I did 6. The scheduling allows for this flexibility, and getting good grades, remembering things, and enjoying your life is more important than getting through the course work fast. Also, do not be afraid to ask professors for prerequisite modifications   Let me know if you have any questions, and I can try to answer them"

I can't believe that last day of classes ends Friday and first exam is saturday morning. that's insanity. I'm excited but scared ! I have a friend in the bridge right now and he says there's only one girl in his classes.

The group does well for itself, because everyone that wants to be there works like they want to be there.  Fun Story time: We had a gal in one of our classes get through everything and into UVic.

VictoriaBC,31ss12,castlite,33,Tue Apr 7 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"First off, government and education jobs are declining (hiring freezes and budget cuts) but don't despair because the people saying those are the only jobs are wrong. Tech is the largest industry in Victoria by a lot and here are 18 jobs related to marketing that are currently posted. There are currently 80 job openings in tech on that job board alone.   Tourism is also enjoying a rebound and worth looking at thanks to the weak Canadian dollar and a lot of marketing effort.  There are 15,000 employees working directly for local tech companies (plus 3,000 freelancers and an estimated 5,000 more tech jobs in government and education). Tourism/Hospitality is our largest employer with estimates as high as 40,000 jobs but the knock on those is that they are more seasonal and pay less. By contrast, the Provincial government employs 12,000 people in Victoria, UVic employs 4,000.  As for your question, many of us were not born here but found a job. The challenge is that Victoria has one of the best lifestyles possible and as such a lot more people than 370,000 want to live here so it's competitive.   On top of that, with most of us coming from elsewhere we left places like Calgary and Toronto for a reason. The biggest mistake I see people make is showing up here and talking about what a big deal they are wherever they just came from. First, Victorian's tend to boast less and prove their worth rather than hype themselves and second, if you were drowning in opportunity where you left, why are you here? Nothing turns a local network off like someone talking about how much better somewhere else is.  The second biggest mistake people make is not giving themselves enough time. I was told in 2001 (never been able to confirm) that only 1/19 jobs are advertised in Victoria. I'm not sure how accurate that is today but I do know that Victorians would much rather hire someone based on a connection or a recommendation and building a network is vital to finding a rewarding job here.   Standing out and building a network takes time and quite often I see people simply without enough financial resources to stick it out. Further, building a network can be exhausting and some people just pack it in rather than put in the time. In the end, if you think counting resumes and applications submitted is your key metric you're gonna have a bad time. On the other hand, if you are willing to hustle and get out and meet people over a number of months (no less than 4 and up to 8) you have a good shot.  The third biggest mistake is believing everything you read on the Internet. Seek people that give you facts and avoid the opinions of those that lean on generalizations and anecdotes. Nothing turns me off faster than a job hunter that starts trying to blame the place for their lack of success.   If you make the leap, send me a DM and I'll make three intros to people that can help start building your network.  It may not be the easiest place to move to but it is worth it."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,70sJesus,40,Tue Apr 7 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"The VAST majority of people in Victoria came here from somewhere else. There's no prejudice against ""out of towners"", it's just that jobs are hard to find. Especially in a city where a large part of the work force works in a government-funded area (university, navy, or provincial government)."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,Sasken,15,Tue Apr 7 22:14:07 2015 UTC,Also with this Victoria is a desirable place to live. With that in mind you end up with more people wanting to move here than the local economy can support.
VictoriaBC,31ss12,Dravos82,4,Tue Apr 7 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say there is plenty of snark for out of towners, but it all comes from people who thought they could be the last person to move there from somewhere else before they raised the drawbridge. Same shit you see in Whistler or Banff or Tofino.  Don't let it bug you."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,TroAhWei,8,Wed Apr 8 07:26:48 2015 UTC,"In my experience, who you know is better than a resume. So, if you don't know anybody, then you're already at a disadvantage."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,EskimoDave,14,Wed Apr 8 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"There is a ""who you know"" culture here. Getting interviews usually happens by a referral or knowing someone inside. And as many have pointed out its very competitive. Everyone continues to flock to The Garden City which means a line of 50-100 deep of every $50K a year job with benefits. The classic tale of the Albertan or Ontarian with an MBA leaving a $100K annual job to come to paradise and take a massive pay cut because ""it's worth it"". You end up with employers getting the pick of the litter and being able to pass over perfectly qualified people for the more educated/qualified/experienced. Also, while it is government jobs (provincial, municipal and some federal), there is a tech industry but mostly we are a service and tourism economy here. Add lower wages (comparatively to Alberta and Ontario), much higher cost of goods and services, 2nd most expensive real estate market in Canada, fewer jobs, and steep competition for all those trying to move up who are already here and all the influx of people moving here, and you get a cocktail of a very discouraging market for job seekers."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,hankexfa,2,Wed Apr 8 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"But it's not the second most expensive real estate market.  Toronto, Vancouver, Richmond, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, and Vaughan are all higher (mostly much higher) and Calgary+Hamilton are quite close.   Granted this features 4 municipalities from the Lower Mainland and 3 from the GTA but if this data took into account our entire region I think we would find the West Shore, Sooke, Esquimalt and much of the Peninsula in Greater Victoria below other municipalities like Edmonton, Ottawa, Saskatoon, Regina, Waterloo, and Montreal.  Sooke is less than a 45 minute drive from downtown Victoria and has homes in the mid 300's and low 400's...you won't find brand new homes that close to many other major urban centres for much less.  Plus everywhere else has either cold winters or a hell of a lot more rain, less parkland, lower life expectancy, longer commutes etc.  At the end of the day, a place this good should cost more and you will have to hustle to stand out but that's unavoidable when you have so many superior lifestyle characteristics. Even then, we are not outside the norms of places much less desirable."

It's bullshit.  An over-the-phone interview with someone who, honestly, not only asked me a question, but asked me the question three times, got the same answer, three times in a row, then asked me it yet again... telling me they aren't the brightest, or not even bothering to really pay attention and do a good job - plus I know people who work there... and I still couldn't get hired.

I would suggest doing your research and try and find work before you move, as waiting tables really isn’t a career that will let you buy a house.  Also living downtown is very expensive, look around for a place that you like the municipalities all have their charm."

In my opinion it's largely an infrastructure issue (like an overpass at McKenzie Rd off of the highway that's been needed for YEARS). There HAS been a population increase but the roads and public transit have not been altered accordingly."

VictoriaBC,31ss12,Danasaurus_Rex,2,Wed Apr 8 01:15:15 2015 UTC,I think the job market in Victoria is generally very difficult.  Without 'local insider' information regarding non-advertised jobs a search can be much more challenging. I think also it really depends on the industry you are looking to enter.
VictoriaBC,31ss12,erikmio,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Alberta 10 years ago. The culture is not anti-out-of-towners, it's just a lack of jobs in general."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,ironbritt,2,Thu Apr 9 04:40:19 2015 UTC,I agree. It's more of a supply and demand equation. Will ultimately depend on your skills/experience and what you are looking for. A few details on what your background is and what sort of work you're looking for will provide some context.
VictoriaBC,31ss12,f-a-p,4,Fri Apr 10 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"You just need to understand that the only ""industries"" to work in here are either the University of the provincial government. Outside of that the employment situation tends to be in service industries for those that work (or even go to) the University or work for the government.  Besides that there isn't a lot of work here to be had and like most places who you know is as important (if not more important) than what you know. So it definitely feels like it's harder for ""outsiders"" to land a job here (and in some respects it is) but the other larger part is that there isn't a whole lot of work here to be had."

VictoriaBC,31ss12,PixelCanuck,2,Tue Apr 7 22:59:50 2015 UTC,I recall reading like 5years ago that tech took over tourism as the number one industry.ಠ_ಠ
VictoriaBC,31ss12,MisguidedSoul,5,Tue Apr 7 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"Really? I had no idea.  I wonder how they're measuring that. Certainly not in terms of total employment, but I guess in terms of dollars it could be. IBM and Sierra certainly rake in a ton of money considering how many of their guys they bring to the average design meeting."
VictoriaBC,31ss12,Sasken,3,Tue Apr 7 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"This is how it was measured  It's based on revenue not total jobs. Last I heard, tourism/hospitality employed more than double the number of people than tech but tourism has half the economic impact.  It's also a common misconception that local tech is focused on working on Provincial government contracts but even in it's heyday (before big cuts started in 2008) local government work accounted for less than a third of revenues. Today it's 10% in a good year.  With 880+ tech companies selling around the world it is a very diverse, stable and growing industry. For some reason, many locals parrot compounded fictions and assumptions even after many studies have revealed how fast the tech sector is growing and the impact it has on the local economy.   One of the key contributing factors to this misunderstanding is the fact that most local tech companies sell globally and may not sell anything in Victoria. They are located here due to a history with one of the schools or research labs and for the lifestyle not for the customer base. As such, most have little reason to promote locally and are invisible to outsiders...most don't even have a sign!"
VictoriaBC,31ss12,70sJesus,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"You're right. I think it must be revenue.

My SO and I have  always had good jobs but would walk the streets and look at a 1930s 3br shithole and say ""just think, in 30 years of hard work maybe we could own that."""

VictoriaBC,31ss12,canucksrule,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:36:58 2015 UTC,Marketing and Advertising.
VictoriaBC,31ss12,MrYYJ,4,Tue Apr 7 21:52:33 2015 UTC,"I am a marketing specialist. I work with Victoria companies, but about half of my clients are in the US.   Victoria is a hub for performance marketing and online marketing and programmatic marketing and ecommerce. We rank among the very best. Check out RevenueWire and Neverblue. Also Go2mobi, Red Brick Media, Ring Partner, Pretio. CheckFront just landed a sizable funding deal.  Most of these companies want marketers with very strong performance marketing skills. If you can get results from paid advertising while optimizing and reducing costs, you will do fine.  All of the big ""ad agencies"" here folded in about 2010 in the aftermath of the recession, as businesses and government (which was the big local buyer of tradtional  advertising) stopped buying ads on the sides of buses.  What's left are smaller shops that focus on elegant web design.   For sales, I'm not so sure. What is your vertical? Because the tech scene has a number of them - renewable energy, ecommerce, mapping/GIS, gaming, building controls, remote sensing, aerospace (although Viking just laid off 1/4 of its staff) rail...  But in regards to sales, each of these verticals speaks its own language.  Outside of the tech scene, Victoria businesses can be pretty cheap. I've worked with law, tourism, and health clients (besides tech).  But the question is, what is your vertical?"

Its a little tricky over the winter but a great deal of small business owners and managers in this town are from elsewhere, so it would be silly of them to exclude new people.  Don't be afraid to pull out the yellowpages and start making cold-calls, I've gotten a number of great jobs that way.  If all else fails then go to Rhino Labour or Labour Unlimited (both of them are on Douglas Street) with steel toed boots and work gloves at five thirty in the morning and they'll put you to work somewhere on a temporary basis. I know a bunch of guys that did this and worked at a bunch of different places as a temp until they found something that fit and wound up getting taken on full time. If you're willing to show up on time and sober and you work like you actually care about getting the job done and learning how to do it right then finding a full time job through the temp agencies is pretty easy.   If you're looking for a short term sublet for the summer you'll have an easy time finding them since you get students moving away and the treeplanters and other bush workers going away to work.  This town is all around pretty great to new people, go to shows and community events and you'll find people are willing to make friends quickly."

I was even looking at the worst time of year (August/September) but there were a few options and I wound up taking the second one I viewed.  Seconding Fernwood as a recommendation, both for proximity to the hospitality and for overall dog-friendliness."
VictoriaBC,31r7jx,skyscraper-submarine,7,Tue Apr 7 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd maybe try to go the airbnb route or check out summer sublets or something similar for a short time( while maybe keeping your stuff in a storage locker, assuming you're driving out and bringing your stuff), and then looking for a place you both enjoy while you're here. I've lived in a fair few places all over Victoria, and can safely say that what you see is not always what you get. It would also be nice to have a look around the different neighbourhoods and see what you like.   James bay and Cook street village are both quite nice, and are a little closer to the water, but you do end up paying a premium for that, and in my time there I can't say I felt a whole lot of community. However, I've lived in Fernwood for the last few years, and it's a lovely, vibrant, and friendly community, with a whole lot of character. There's a nice little public square, coffee shop, pub, community center, yoga studio, and lots more good stuff. I myself was living in a very cool 100 year old brick apartment building in the heart of the fernwood village for a couple years, and am now living in a nice little carriage house behind a friend's place, one of whom works at the Royal Jubilee, which is conveniently about a 7 minute walk from here.   Though not a bad fallback plan that someone else suggested, I myself have been inside many devon properties and brown bros apartments for work purposes, and can honestly say I would never choose to live in one. They are all very cookie-cutter bland, beige, and not without their fair-share of problems. Also, far more expensive than they should be in comparison to some of the other cute and/or funky places you can find in an neat old city like this.  Anywho, best of luck!

VictoriaBC,31r7jx,Jemma6,2,Tue Apr 7 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"Don't give up! It's tough to find a place with a dog, especially when you're not here, but I've lived in SOOOO many places around town (mostly in the areas you described) and they do exist!  I would use padmapper. You can choose 'pets allowed' option, and customize your search based on the map of Victoria.   Check with Apartments R Us. I have lived in two of their places and they both are apartments downtown that allow pets (even large sized dogs).  They tend to be more expensive on average because they buy up old buildings and renovate to make nicer looking apartments, but so far I've had no complaints (and I really prefer the idea of a manager who is not always in my business, so it works really well for us.)   Other main property management companies to check with are: Duttons (don't allow pets to my knowledge), Brown Bros, Capreit (or caprent, but locally it's Capreit), Devon, Proline, Complete Residential, Pemberton Homes, and David Burr.  http://www.apartmentsrus.ca/"
VictoriaBC,31r7jx,knottysleeves,3,Tue Apr 7 20:50:25 2015 UTC,I think that's the first positive review of Apartments R Us I've ever heard. :-) They don't have a great reputation.
VictoriaBC,31r7jx,Jemma6,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"I was so nervous when I was thinking about going with them. They have a HORRIBLE reputation.  I did my research for sure, and called the company and grilled them about it.     I can see why people were upset, as most of the people writing those reviews were ones that had been 'evicted' after renovations were done and rent was raised. Most of these problems were on the East coast but it did happen locally. (It sounds like they buy a building, renovate, get a property assessment, and then up the rent. Sounds like if tenants couldn't afford the increase, they were evicted. Pretty shitty!)   Considering both my places were POST reno., I don't have much to complain about.  My apartment is expensive but it's nice looking and it's in a good area. My manager is there if I need her, and otherwise leaves us entirely alone.  It's easy to pay rent (I can pay online using debit), and the building is full of great tenants.  Also, people with large breed dogs can't be too choosy... so when we found something nice looking in the right area we jumped on it.   So far, no complaints what-so-ever! (It's been a year)  :)"
VictoriaBC,31r7jx,ILoveBabyBats,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:10:17 2015 UTC,In BC it is illegal to raise the rent more than 2% plus inflation per year.
VictoriaBC,31r7jx,knottysleeves,2,Wed Apr 8 05:41:57 2015 UTC,"True, but what Apartments R Us did is serve tenants with eviction notices due to major renovations (which is legal under the Residential Tenancy Act), but then apparently did mostly minor renovations yet still jacked up the rent significantly. It's a loophole in BC, and they took full advantage of it.  Some ""renoviction"" cases have been fought successfully (especially in Vancouver) but most tenants either cannot afford or can't be bothered to fight it."

This is an important factor. We are leaning towards buying a place now as we will have some money for a down payment and what you can get for a monthly mortgage price is way more than you can get when renting it seems PLUS it seems places are WAY more apt to allow dogs if you buy haha.

The thing is to have plenty of off-leash space a short distance away from the apartment and to be willing to invest a lot of time and energy into taking your dog out there to romp around and exercise, which you should be doing even if you live in a house with a yard.  Smaller spaces are often easier to keep clean, you just have to be on top of it.  If I had to pick between a medium sized yard with a house in Esquimalt, away from any large parks or a small apartment a ten minue walk from Beacon Hill Park or Cedar Hill I'd take the small apartment any time."

VictoriaBC,31nvrn,notsewkram,3,Tue Apr 7 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"We have been growing from seeds for a few years so I can offer some advice and information.   Concerning starts, it depends on your resources. If you do have a south-facing window and a bit of extra cash you can start your own plants from seeds now in little organic peat pots. Be sure to have a water-safe surface to keep the surface safe and the plants from getting water-logged and molding (we use flipped-over tupperware lids). It will take some daily TLC (water, mainly) until you need to pot-up to a larger pot. If doing this, I recommend you seed into a starter soil from the garden store, then pot-up into SeaSoil, which is sold by the bag at gardening stores. It is produced up-Island and is wonderful for growing here.  Tomatoes and peppers do grow well here, depending on location. Spinach is a safe bet from Spring through Fall, as are a variety of herbs (mint/ parsley/ sage, etc).

There is the possibility this has happened, but ENE News quotes from an old AP report. So there is nothing new to report.  In practice it doesn't much matter if the corium is still in the containment building or in the ground.   The base of the containment building is cracked, allowing groundwater to enter, circulate around the corium, and then exit, making its way into the ocean.  This problem is mitigated to a certain extent by the cooling system, but that is also creating millions of liters of radioactive cooling water.  Tepco is estimating it will take 40 years to decomission the plant. The question is, can the risk of continued local radioactive contamination be mitigated in the meantime? My answer is ""yes"", but then again Fukushima and Minami Soma are pretty isolated even within Fukushima prefecture, so... out of sight, out of mind."
VictoriaBC,31mp99,MrYYJ,2,Tue Apr 7 07:08:26 2015 UTC,"There is the possibility this has happened, but ENE News quotes from an old AP report. So there is nothing new to report.   I didn't know March 27, 2015 would be considered an 'old' report. A muon test showed there is no fuel left in reactor 1. Apparently it has all gone to the containment vessel. And they don't know the condition of the containment vessel. If groundwater can enter and circulate around the corium, this means the corium itself could have melted through.  Japan Times said of the test: ""But the fuel could possibly have escaped even beyond the containment facility to the outside environment.""   Tepco is estimating it will take 40 years to decomission the plant.   As of end of March, 2015 Tepcos new Decommissioning manager is saying the technologies to clean up and decommission haven't been invented yet and that it may take 200 years.    Akira Ono, chief of Fukushima Daiichi, Mar 28, 2015: “There are so many uncertainties… For removal of the debris, we don’t have accurate information or any viable methodology… I believe human beings have the capability to develop technologies… It may take 200 years.”   Watch the video.   In practice it doesn't much matter if the corium is still in the containment building or in the ground.   Excuse me? Whether the corium is in the containment vessel or has escaped into the ground matters a great deal in the amount of radiation that has escaped into the environment, how to capture it, and the methodology for containment / decommissioning.  For example: If the corium from Chernobyl had not been fully captured by the containment vessel the 'sarcophagus' method of decommissioning would not have worked. Of course the Russians were 'lucky' in that Chernobyl was built on solid rock, while Fukushima was built on sandy, gravel landfill over an underground river leading to the ocean."

Japan Times said of the test:    That's actually an AP article. And the hypothesis that corium escaped outside of containment is made by the writer of the piece, and not by any expert. It is possible.  In regards to Chernobyl, as a matter of fact the reactor in that case was not built on bedrock. If the concrete subbasement had not contained the corium it would have dropped into an underground stream, setting off a massive steam explosion.  As I mentioned, due to cracks in the foundation of the the Fukushima reactor containment building and pervasive groundwater, it doesn't much matter if the corium is inside or outside the containment at this point."

VictoriaBC,31j5wq,phishyfingers,9,Sun Apr 5 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"We replaced our old (1960's) oil furnace with a heat pump and electric furnace. The electric furnace (""supplemental heat"") only comes on a few times a year; the heat pump does all the heating and cooling most of the time.  We've had it about 5 years. I don't remember the name of the company that installed it (""Essential Air"" I think) but they have apparently gone out of business anyway.  Our fan is on all the time, at varying speeds. They told us that was more efficient and less jarring than having it come on and go off. It took a few days to get used to that very quiet background ""shhh"" of air moving all the time but we love it now. The house is the same temperature all the time: no spikes.  It also took a few days to get used to the sound of the heat pump outside the house. It's not noisy at all, it's just different. You hear it start and stop for the first few days. Then you never notice it again.  I don't pay much attention to our hydro bill. It's not small, since everything in our house is now electric (heat as well as everything else) but my guess is that it's less than we paid for oil.  But even if it cost more it's just so much nicer than the oil furnace. It's steady-state temperature instead of spikes, it's not smelly at all, and the modern thermostats are so handy (programmable, etc.). I wouldn't go back if you paid me.   To me it's a no-brainer. And our climate is perfect for a heat pump: it almost never gets cold enough to need the supplemental heat, and while the heat pump CAN do A/C as well it almost never gets hot enough to need it. So most of the time it's just chugging along on low power."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,Sasken,3,Sun Apr 5 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"Victoria has an ideal climate for heat pumps. Simple air to air units can operate year round here. They should almost never use their backup electric heat and will be cheaper to run than your oil furnace. Plus it gives you AC in the summer.  The only place they fall behind an oil or gas furnace is if you have a lot of heating to do quickly, typically the air coming from a heat pump won't get as hot as a furnace.  Every home in Victoria should be using one."

My total bill was $6k net with electrical. This was about 5 years back.   I kept my oil and they put in the heat exchange into the ducting. They upgraded the furnace fan motor because it does run more frequently. The air is not as hot but the house is more consistently 20.5c where I like it.   The aux heat, oil, only comes on a few days a year and last year I had to force the system into air conditioning mode.   I used to pay $2500 a year in oil and now pay around 500 extra in hydro.   I love the heat pump and will go to lengths to use them in the future."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,dicer,2,Sun Apr 5 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"I have a variable speed heat pump, Mitsubishi Mr. Slim (ducted version, not mini-split ductless). We removed a 25 kw electrical furnace and our air handler now has a 5kw backup handler in it.   We went with the variable speed heat pump (Mr. Slim ""zuba central"" in particular) for these reasons: 1. Variable speed is much more efficient than 2-stage as it will move the amount of air that's needed, no more. Also does not require a lot of power to start it unlike single & 2 stage which require a jolt of electricity to start. 2. dB noise: They claim on their site that it's 52db, when I bought it they claimed it was 48db. What I can tell you is it's near silent, this was important to us. 3. Winter weather: It can operate at a very high efficiency down in the -20 C's. Most other heat pumps begin to lose efficiency & stop working once it gets below 3C. My backup heat source (the 5kw inside the handler) has only kicked in a few times since it was installed which has had a big impact on my bills.  At the time there were only 2 companies in YYJ that installed the Mitsubishi Mr. Slim: Foster & WestBay. There may be more as well now. If you have other questions, feel free to ask."

We wanted to make the deadline for all the ""eco"" rebates so we did a bunch of work in a few weeks which all contributed to the reduced energy usage. We had the insulation and windows upgraded, and we disconnected all of our baseboard heaters and now exclusively use our ductless Mr. Slim heat pump. Average Usage I had quotes from 3 companies and ended up going with Servicexcel, they weren't the cheapest but we are extremely happy with the service and product."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,ridelife44,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"I have a heat pump and electric back up furnace, which as sasken noted only comes on a few times a year.  Our house is an early 70s stucco sided house with dual pane windows, new doors, and extra insulation in the attic.  About 2400sqft.   When we bought it about 7 years ago, the price of electricity was much lower.  We bought it to get rid of the old oil furnace.    Our electricity bills are now pushing 800$ for 2 months in the winter.  There are 4 adults in the house.  If I had an option I would NEVER have bought a heat pump.  They aren't super efficient in our climate and with the price of electricity ever on the rise, it costs more each year.  If I had to do it again I'd go with a super high efficiency natural gas furnace.  The price of gas has come down considerably on the island due to fee structuring changes.  We have since installed a wood burning insert.  It is much more cost effective and a much nicer heat.  FYI our bills while burning wood this winter hit 550$/2 months vs 780$/2months the year before when we weren't burning wood."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,z781,6,Sun Apr 5 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"Is your heat pump a 1-stage (on or off), 2-stage (off, low speed, high speed) or variable speed DC heat pump (off,and pump can go at any speed)? Variable speeds typically 1.5 - 2x the cost of a 2-stage heat pump, but they operate more efficiently.  What's the R-value in your attic? If it's not around R40, your heat/cool from your heat pump is just rising and leaving your house.  All that said though, I'd highly recommend getting an air leakage test done on your house. They're not that expensive and with bills that high, I have a feeling your heat is leaving your house quickly.  I have a variable speed heat pump, and it lowered by bill significantly from what it was when it was just an electric furnace.

As far as i know the compressor only runs at one speed, as it always makes the same level of noise.     R value in attic is R30-R40 depending on the area.  I did blown in insulation myself, added about 12-16"" ontop of the R24 that was there... Also in the summer when the heat pump isn't running ( we don't use the AC) our bills are still between 450-550 for 2 months.

Try turning off the main breaker to the house and see if you're still using energy. If so, there's a problem with your meter.  Next go breaker by breaker (with everything unplugged) and monitor your draw. You may want to buy a device so you can see draw while in house. See if one circuit is using a lot of power.

We don't keep the house super warm (sometimes need a sweatshirt in the winter) but it's not cold either. Just comfortable most of the time.

You must have something else that's sucking up a lot of power - dishwasher maybe? We don't have one, although you wouldn't think it would make that huge a difference.  Or do you have baseboard heaters as well?  I think the majority of our power use is the clothes dryer, not heat.  I'd freak if I saw a bill over $500 even in a cold snap in the winter. I wasn't exaggerating about $150 for 2 months in the summer. That's actually rounding up (I think it was $147 exactly)."

VictoriaBC,31j5wq,NOT_A_JABRONI,2,Mon Apr 6 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is that natural gas just wasn't available on the Island years ago, unlike the prairies, where NG is plentiful and cheap, and it's easy to install NG pipes underground over long distances. Oil could be barged over, loaded onto trucks, and distributed to homes, so many early homes used oil. The killer with oil tanks is that many were buried underground or put in basements and they would eventually leak. This can be an unexpected expense for homeowners, - many have been hit with huge remediation bills. A good alternative now are efficient NG furnaces to replace oil. Electric heating is expensive and getting more so. BC utilities commission approved a >25% increase in BCHydro rates over 5 years."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,maurice-san,2,Mon Apr 6 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"No natural gas for a very long time. Only ""recently"" did the island get gas, thus many heating systems were all oil or wood. I am from the Lower mainland and I had never heard of oil furnaces either until coming to Victoria."

Nothing working in the house yet, so I have no idea how it will perform. Ours was installed by Coastal Heat Pumps, I worked with Don. He was a good guy, fun to work with, and his quote much better than several others I spoke with in the business. Our heat pump is a Fujitsu AOU48RLXFZ1  Our system works using small coolant lines being piped around the house, rather than massive ductwork, and the air being handled by individual air handling units in 4 independent zones. I didn't like the look of the wall mounted units,  so I paid extra to hide the air handlers in the ceiling and crawl space, and then had it ducted with very small ducts to where I want the heat/cool pushed.  The actual heat pump is supposed to function well right up until -18C, which shouldn't really happen in Victoria. We also installed a gas fireplace, and another wood burning fireplace.   Our system cost nearly $18K to install. Woof."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,LeftHandedOctopus,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"I was debating this issue for quite a while with an old inefficient electric furnace. Instead of a heat pump I went with a variable gas furnace (96% efficient) and we love it. Because we aren't going from an oil furnace there weren't any rebates and we don't really find the house too hot in the summer to warrant the air conditioning features of the heat pump, we thought we'd save a few thousand dollars and went with gas. Middle of winter it costs us probably an extra $45 a month in gas (I think), but we're saving hundreds a month compared to our old furnace.   We like having the house colder at night and having a heat pump bring up the temp in whole house every morning isn't the best use of a pump. Furnace kicks on silently and heats the house really quickly in the morning and then runs on low off and on throughout the day.  There's not really a wrong answer as to what to go with but our furnace was about 3k installed by Jordie at Red/Blue. Great guy and very fair, came in about $600 cheaper than Westbay."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,bcballer411,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:07:17 2015 UTC,"We went with a 97% efficient gas furnace.  We purchased from a firm called Homeglow Heat Products.

The gas installation was very inexpensive.  You can do your own trenching pretty easily, and we had to pay Fortis about $100 for the meter.  It was very, very cheap.

Our average gas spend is $95 per month.  No upgraded attic insulation.  This includes a lot of fireplace in the winter and a fair bit of BBQ.  We did this right after buying the house so I don't know what the heating costs were using the old oil/electric equipment.  I'm from Alberta, so the gas furnace felt right to me.  On the second stage it takes a couple of hours to get the house from ~6 degrees to 22.  The Nest calls only the low stage every morning, so it takes about 45 minutes to heat the house up but it's warm when we wake up.  It rarely calls the second stage except when coming up to temperature when we've been away, or on cold mornings when the Nest mis-judges the pre-warm time and it misses it's scheduled ""at temperature"" time.  It fires the high stage for 15 or 20 minutes to catch it up.  I sort of miss the chance to have air conditioning, but I like how quiet the solution is overall.  Running the fan for a couple of hours when it's hot out brings the cold air up from the basement, so that works okay, too."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,seanboddity,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:43:26 2015 UTC,"Good point about the electrical - if your house is older, you'll need to upgrade the panel to 200 amp."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,orangeisthebestcolor,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"A heat pump will use a lot more electricity than an oil furnace, but you're not burning any oil of course.  I did the research/pricing for my house last year, and was looking at a return of 10 years.  Since I don't think I'm going to be in the house that long it's been put on the backburner.  I work in a related industry, albeit on commercial projects.  I've hired Red Blue on some of my projects, and they are definitely quality, stand-up guys."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,Great68,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"We have baseboard heating in a big 1912 house.  single pane windows etc.  We still only pay about $2000 a year in heating.  If a heat pump install costs you $10,000 but only saves you 20% on your bill it's going to take 25 years to make your money back.  Unless you're convinced you're going to stay in your house for a very long time I don't think its a worthwhile investment."
VictoriaBC,31j5wq,jimmyvic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:17:51 2015 UTC,Natural gas is so cheap at the moment that having a new efficient gas furnace is much cheaper than a heat pump. We have both. That being said natural gas could always go up... heat pumps have a lot of potential as the technology improves. They also work great in Victoria's climate. So I actually recommend having both since you will need a backup if the temperature drops below 2C or so.

The Good:   Fantastic place to raise kids. A great self contained and safe environment where kids can go and visit neighbours or play outside. Actually get to know neighbours, many becoming good friends. Places are often better maintained then a rental. If you like gardening, many have plots members can use.   The bad:   Everyone is supposed to volunteer, but not everyone does their part. Committees... learn your Robert Rules of Order :) Rules, rules, and more rules. The older the place, the bigger the rule book. Every co-op seems to have someone who is a stickler for every single one. Drama.... The price of knowing neighbours seems to be the drama it can produce. One place it led to threats and cops being called regularly.   Many consider co-ops simply because of the lower rents without thinking of the of responsibilities. For many co-ops, rents (shares) are no longer lower than market.  edit: pets? Waterside was good with cats, while Krisineleos allowed smaller dogs too."
VictoriaBC,319w6i,swabbie,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm good with volunteering, it seems the ones that have  a webpage with some info often only ask for 4-6 hours a month which is easy peasy. I hadn't considered drama..  Cheers!"
VictoriaBC,319w6i,swabbie,2,Fri Apr 3 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"4-6 hours is a pretty standard minimum for most members during most times, but this can increase depending on roles you take or committees you volunteer for. The Board of Directors traditionally takes the most time.  Yard work, cleaning parties, fence repairs and other maintenance all factors in. You may, for instance be assigned a section of lawn or garden to maintain over and above your other obligations."

Some of these are similar to what you might find in a combination between a neighborhood association and a rental apartment.   To get the most out of it, you really have to buy in to the mind set. You have to take ownership of your home like you would with a house. The rules simply make it possible to live with others. This is honestly less of a problem that I have found living in rentals... And you can always work to have the rules changed unlike in a rental."

Store clerks Office workers (incl. government) Tech workers (programmers, computer repair) Trades (electricians, plumbers, welders etc) Retirees Single parents, out of work Disabled   Many co-ops have a certain number of units allotted for low-income members. Often these go to single parents or retirees. Sometimes a current member falls on hard times and can get help too."

The extremely simplified version (as I understood it):   Member went to the Board of Directors (BOD) requesting his backyard be restored due to flooding issues. BOD approved of fixing the flood issues but would not repair deck, due to it being non-standard/installed by previous member. Instead they would put in grass like other units. Cue politics, fracturing, miscommunications, failed appeals Member was popular, and had a number of other members take his side Allegations of personal threats, vandalism, harrassment, and more against the BOD or other members Many letters and reports were distributed to all members The BOD attempted to kick the member out but failed, so they all quit As a new / impartial member with previous co-op experience, I ended up serving as interm president to try to sort mess out   On the plus side, the co-op managed to get through it. During my time on the BOD I had excellent help from almost all the members to get through it and keep the place running.  The one exception which I hope serves as a warning to other co-ops, was our own 'rule lady'. She, and she alone, held the co-op computer files, maintenance records, and some of the financials. After the shit went down she quit the BOD and every other role she held. She refused to return or share co-op files and records saying they were her own property. I had to start fresh... The health of the co-op should never rest on a single individual."

We narrowed the coops we applied to down to just a few as many of them didn't seem very well maintained after scoping them out. We had one interview but weren't selected.

I'm very new to night photography and I'm using a older canon with a standard 18-55 f3.5 lens. The body has low ISO for today's standards so I haven't been able to catch much but I'm trying to learn the ropes!
VictoriaBC,31872q,skizzzer,4,Thu Apr 2 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks man :)  Single image. I borrowed my friend's Tokina 11-16mm lens for this shot. Your lens should be fine but you won't pick up as many stars. Keep your shutter speed between 10-25 seconds, max aperture (f/3.5 in your case), and adjust your iso accordingly. Don't go beyond 30s for shutter speed because you'll start getting star trails. If you want more stars than you can image stack, but you'll need a special program to merge the images and I've never done that so can't really help you there. Oh and you definitely need a tripod in case you didn't know that already.  Keep in mind that you'll be able to bring a lot of stars out and remove most of the noise in post. The milky way was not even visible in my RAW image, for example."

VictoriaBC,31569s,nrtphotos,4,Fri Apr 3 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"True, and the city is fishing for cash from the feds to build some more rooms, but being homeless does not leave you with zero responsibilities. You can not just take a shit on the trail, leave a huge pile of garbage, cigarette buts and needles behind. Maybe enforcing some litter laws would help, and separate the scumbags from the good folks who just needed a place to sleep."

Its not about letting them off the hook for what they've done or punishing the offence, its about looking at the root of what's going on and doing something about it.   Do a little googling and take a look at what happened to addiction rates in Portugal when they stopped using police resources to lock up addicts and started using those resources to fund treatment centers and mental health facilities."

Except that you completely bypass my point, which is that continued policing doesn't do the trick and that those funds are better put towards housing, mental health and addictions counselling by claiming that its up to the provincial or federal government to fund those things.  Whether or not we can use the democratic process to get funding from the province or the federal government is a completely different argument but municipal police services are funded by the city, as are a large proportion of services to the poor and the homeless. Paying attention to municipal politics and voting for the right people can actually influence policy around here, not to mention letter writing campaigns, volunteering with groups which advocate for the mentally ill and the drug addicted (or just people with plain ol' brain injuries if you're too judgemental to want to be anywhere near the other two groups), or just plain not being a dick.  The biggest obstacles towards any of that working include assholes like you who get all negative on the idea of progress and stand up and loudly proclaim that there's nothing to be done about it so we might as well just react out of fear and throw all of the undesireables into jail."

If you know nothing about what its like to try and find a job while homeless, to have to worry about your property still being there when you wake up, to try and find a safe place to stash your things while you go to work, to fight with addiction while sleeping outside, to try and cope with a brain injury or to spend six months on a waiting list so that you can get the mental health support you need in order to function at a workplace then you don't get to say shit about how to ""deal"" with the homeless."

I look forward to it, hopefully she has some other plans for all the open drug dealing going on on Pandora 24-7. Maybe someone can link it?"
VictoriaBC,31569s,Notnoodles,-2,Fri Apr 3 12:24:13 2015 UTC,I'd more focus on cleaning up Douglas and View - areas where normal people go.  I'd like the Whale Wall to not be crackhead central - areas where normal people go.  No one normal is hanging around Pandora and Amelia - period. So why even clean it up if no one cares?  I guess it has a lot of people travelling through on Pandora - so we could move all the crack activity up to Rock Bay. But don't entertain any illusions that drug culture isn't deeply embedded in BC.  Drugs in Ontario are currency.  Drugs in BC are lifestyle.

VictoriaBC,30w9h8,HotterRod,2,Wed Apr 1 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"There are enough people that don't know anything about computers.  They need a new one because their HP crapped out yet again, so they decide to go for the small local store with good personal service and people that can recommend something actually good.  If you're not passionate about computers, the last thing you want to do is scour NCIX's website for 3 hours trying to piece together what everything is and whether it will work."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,Turtlecupcakes,5,Wed Apr 1 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"NCIX, NewEgg, Amazon - anywhere but a big box store like Future Shop. BestBuy or Futureshop are probably the worst place to buy anything gaming. Poor selection, marked up prices."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,3,Tue Mar 31 06:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you got a chance to physically hold the device before placing your NCIX order."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,electron_junkie,8,Tue Mar 31 14:45:34 2015 UTC,Not if you are ordering anything that isn't complete garbage. Try listening to a good quality gaming headset there. Impossible because they carry turtlebeaches and nothing else. Yea it's nice as a showroom for ncix/amazon. But I'd rather just have an ncix
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,2,Tue Mar 31 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"On the other hand if it is something they actually do carry, like Logitech mice or Corsair mechanical keyboards Best Buy does price matching. But yeah I doubt BB's selection of headsets and headphones is any better than FS's was, better going online and looking for them there especially since the prices will more than likely be lower.   EDIT: According to BestBuy.ca they don't sell Corsair products... that seem's weird."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ehManiacal,5,Tue Mar 31 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Last time i visited: Regarding keyboards they sold logitech and razer keyboards. Only one mechanical (razer) with one choice in keyswitch. Which means you don't even get to test the feel of different ones.   Mice wise they usually aren't up to par with recent products and releases, leaving a real lack of selection.   EDIT: According to BestBuy.ca they don't sell Corsair products... that seem's weird.    Ive never actually seen a corsair product in BB or FS or stuff like Tt esports (thermaltake)."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"I assumed they had them because they do in the states, at least I'm pretty sure I've seen them in photos on /r/pcmasterrace. Surprising they don't seeing how Corsair is pushing their lame tramp stamp logo and gaming line to compete more with Razer. Except Corsair uses MX Cherry switches and not the less expensive Khail ones that Razer has changed too."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ehManiacal,6,Wed Apr 1 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"go to FS/BB and see if they have any demo units. Try to get a feel for it, then go home and buy it on NCIX for less."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,spacemoose81,3,Tue Mar 31 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"Except now they price match NCIX, Newegg, and Amazon.. so after saving the shipping, they are actually cheaper."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ItsBrownJamesBrown,4,Tue Mar 31 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"Not if its a limited time offer (sale) and you must include shipping costs   3.The product must be priced in Canadian Dollars and include all environmental fees, shipping costs, and other charges.   5.The product must be in stock, available for sale, and cannot be a limited time offer or available only in limited quantity.    Edit: NCIX also does pricematching at checkout and i think newegg does as well. Been a while since i built my rig so i could be outdated"
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,3,Tue Mar 31 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry to much about the terms. I have got my G500, Siberia V2's, G15 keyboard, Asus 144hz monitor, and a few TB HDD's and 1 SSD from futureshop through the price match system. All purchases were on sale through either NCIX or Newegg and they did not make me pay for any shipping charge, just straight price match to whatever was on the site."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ItsBrownJamesBrown,3,Tue Mar 31 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Even with that selection is pretty poor, and outdated. I will definitely take that into account when window shopping there"
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,3,Tue Mar 31 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Ya its never really that great, but always an added bonus if they have what your looking for.. I basically just have an inventory on pc part picker running all the time and when I find a price I can't pass on I usually check and see if its a stock item at FS or BB before I order"
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ItsBrownJamesBrown,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"Well Amazon is free shipping for gaming (and better quality) stuff since it all costs more than $25, and NCIX seems to be offering a near constant free shipping over $50 or something.  But yes, if BB has it in stock and will price match it, not a bad idea. Especially if you don't have a credit card."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ehManiacal,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"I hate ordering pricey things over the Internet, if it's defective you've got to ship it back instead of just taking it to the store and getting a new one.  I'll take a look though."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,james121345,5,Tue Mar 31 16:28:10 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Though I've had better experience with RMA 's than I have with returns in store. Hell amazon refunded my shipping when I ordered a gift for a friend and got the address wrong.
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ItsBrownJamesBrown,3,Tue Mar 31 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"Since no1 has mentioned it yet, this is what I do for most of my parts. Best Buy and Futureshop will price match any canadian retailing store.. so that means NCIX, Newegg, Tigerdirect, Antec What I do is usually go into futureshop, look at there selection and see if there is anything worth while, and then find it on one of those sites and bring it to the customer service desk. 99% of the time it will be ~20-30 cheaper online ,and you will save yourself the shipping. Good luck! Edit : Futureshop is closed, so Best Buy.."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ItsBrownJamesBrown,2,Tue Mar 31 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I may just wait until Best buy ""reopens"" and then go in there and see what they have, although I was looking on NCIX and they have some really cheap TV mounts, which is refreshing since everything worthwhile at Future Shop was $200+.  I'll definitely try this out, seems like a good plan."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ehManiacal,3,Tue Mar 31 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"You want a cheap mount, I got this one for all 3 rooms.. Won't find a better deal and the build quality is great  http://www.amazon.ca/Cheetah-ALAMLB-Articulating-Extension-Including/dp/B001GTT0VO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427824957&sr=8-2&keywords=cheetah+wall+mount"
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,ehManiacal,2,Tue Mar 31 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, definitely going to order that."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,kingbuns2,2,Tue Mar 31 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"You should also use www.pcpartpicker.com and set it to Canada, it is very good for finding price matches across different sites even for peripherals."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,jimmyvic,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on what it is, BestBuy may carry it and they will price match it, but their selection on their website isn't great and is far less than what they carry in the states (headset/phone selection is rather hodge podged and poor, gaming mice and keyboards seems to only be Razer (which can vary greatly in quality and life span and isn't the best for their regular price) and Logitech (which at least makes some great mice).  It may be possible to go through a local PC store, but unfortunately I'm not familiar with them and they'd probably just order it off NCIX and stuff anyway."
VictoriaBC,30w9h8,Curdur,2,Tue Mar 31 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Not much in town, and the stores that are here have shitty selections.  I'd suggest just reading reviews, then buy from NCIX.  They have online pricematching with any online store in Canada, you just can't beat that.    I find Pricefinder, and shopbot to be the best price comparison sites for electronics. http://www.howtosavemoney.ca/savelog/best-price-comparison-sites-canada"
VictoriaBC,30uo61,Risiko19,16,Mon Mar 30 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"I know, like usual I will be downvoted for my opinion but.... Victoria really needs to clean up its act if it wants to stay on these lists. For example the inner harbour where I spent a lot of time this weekend is a complete mess, the hills that separate downtown from the harbour for two blocks are filled with trash, clothing, blankets, beer cans. The pathway is punctuated with garbage cans that have gone lidless since the harbour authority has taken over management, and the crows and gulls have strewn food waste everywhere, the benches and lamp posts have graffiti on them from the homeless people who sit and drink at them, the asphalt portion of the path is in horrible shape and has not been fixed in years, my dauter took a hard fall stepping into a large hole on the path last week. There is without a word of exaggeration 1.6 billion cigarette buts on the ""grass"" between the  path and the ocean. There has been zero landscaping done since the harbour authority took over and the ""grass"" and plants look like shit. I am not even going to coment on the fact you still use the inner harbour as a parkinglot, that is just unmentionable.  Get on this cityofvictoria , if you can not be bothered to clean it up, and its obvious the harbour authority is incompetent then get some help. Take a look at Sidney and what they have done around their public harbour, outs is disgusting in comparison."
VictoriaBC,30uo61,Notnoodles,2,Mon Mar 30 22:12:24 2015 UTC,"Which hills are you referring to?  Do you mean the slopes that go up from the water to the streets?  While I don't feel as strongly about it as you appear to, I've also noticed an increase in garbage around town in general. I am not sure if there is more garbage or if I've just started noticing it more."
VictoriaBC,30uo61,monkey_monkey_monkey,2,Tue Mar 31 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, the slopes, they are disgusting and plainly visible, but basically the entire path from the park beside the soda building all the way to RedfishBluefish is just dirty, dirty, dirty. Not the way a city built on tourist dollars should look."

VictoriaBC,30t5eh,xzieus,9,Mon Mar 30 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Page 34, the conclusion, is the TL;DR :)  It says, essentially, what you would expect:   The software is needless and does not provide a direct ""preventative"" security benefit. What it does do is concentrate private information in a single area ... a very large target for potential threats and abuse.   ""The level of employee surveillance that results from keystroke logging and screenshot capturing should be restricted to use in specific investigations, based on reasonable grounds for suspicion of wrongdoing, and only when other less privacy intrusive measures have been exhausted.""  ""Above all, this investigation demonstrates the need for public bodies to have an effective privacy management program in place to help avoid instituting practices that will place them in contravention of FIPPA, and waste valuable resources in terms of time and money. ""  I would have made the same complaint as the mayor. But then again, I'm the privacy officer at my company. Funny how people are looked at as paranoid until they push it to this point and the results show that they had a right to be concerned."

VictoriaBC,30t5eh,duplicom,11,Mon Mar 30 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"I think one of the major issues here is that the IT Department's excuse excuse for installing the spyware ended up being a lie.

Public agencies, including municipal governments, have been subject to these comprehensive privacy laws for over 20 years. Yet the District went ahead and installed monitoring software, enabling automated screen shots and keystroke logging and other intrusive monitoring tools, without considering how these actions would measure up to their privacy obligations under the law.

They were really hinting at wanting to play a bigger show in Victoria (although I think they specifically mentioned Rifflandia in the fall), but it fits in their schedule nicely - they've only got one show in July so far.  It's tough when they don't give you any hints. Apparently Rush, Journey, and John Mellencamp are around the west coast at that time."
VictoriaBC,30w3di,nrtphotos,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"I also expect the Arkells at either RTS or Rifflandia this year.   My hope is RTS will come back from the classic rock and put more modern rock on the stage. Last year's attendance was way below capacity so I think the organizers know that another Tom Cochrane/Loverboy year is just not gonna cut it. The younger bands (Bright Light Social Hour, Monster Truck, Jesse Roper, Flash Lightning) were the most enjoyed by the people I was with.  That said, I would lose my mind if RUSH was ever booked to play Victoria. Every time I have seen them it has been an arena show of 17-20,000 seats. Since our arena is too small and I can't think of a time RUSH has played a festival, I'm thinking that's a long shot."

Mother Mother played last year to support the Very God Band Thing album and haven't released anything new since. That said, Mother Mother has appeared often on local festival stages. Given they played The Royal three times in December though, talent bookers have to be thinking about over saturation.  I'm pretty sure Vince is working on some new material but I haven't seen nor heard of a pending album release. That said, RTS typically features somebody local in an early time slot (Acres of Lions and Vince Vaccaro in 2013 and then Jesse Roper and Northcote in 2014) so he very well could be considered for that spot. I'd rather see Band of Rascals or Isobel Trigger in a slot like that."

VictoriaBC,30q2vu,Criminoboy,31,Sun Mar 29 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"I saved this from the TC website comments section so I could verify the sources later. I am not the author.  Username thecalgaryeyeopener wrote:  I am a subscriber to kplu the National Public Radio outlet in Western Washington State. My understanding is that 30% of kplu’s and National Public Radio’s audience and subscribers around Western Washington are Canadians. On Wednesday, kplu News reported that Victoria, is ""pouring its raw sewage"" into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Victoria has had a proper sewage system since 1981. In the 1960s and 70s, Victoria spent $175 Million (in 2015 Dollars) to design and build a state-of-the-art sewage system. Dr. Richard Pomeroy who had designed wastewater systems in California for 35 years; Dr. W.J. Kaufman of the University of California, Berkley and a consultant to the U.S. Public Health Service and National Institute of Health; tidal expert Dr. Robert Selleck; Dr. John Nelson, Professor of Preventative Medicine at the University of British Columbia and Canadian Engineering giant Associated Engineering designed and built the system. Victoria completed the system in 1981. It has functioned perfectly ever since. Every ocean scientist at the University of Victoria believes that the system is completely adequate and does not need to be replaced. A replacement would cost a billion dollars or more. Obviously kplu News based its story on hearsay and has not checked its sources. The source of the story is probably a local environmental cult that staged an uninformed campaign about our sewage system in 2006 --- the ""Mr. Floatie Campaign"".

VictoriaBC,30q2vu,Minicomputer,19,Sun Mar 29 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"This is not wrong.  The CRD used to have these numbers on their website, but it appears they have since taken it down    What has been missing is enough public awareness of the effectiveness of the current deep sea outfalls. Currently the Victoria Core Area sewage (which is really 99.93% water and very little actual solids), is discharged from two deep ocean outfalls more than a kilometer from the shore, after first passing through 6 mm screens. There are no “Floaties”. At the end of the outfalls the effluent passes through diffusers that are 200 meters long and 60 meters (200 feet) below the surface of the ocean. Most of the year, the effluent plume is dispersed well below sea level. In the winter months, the diluted effluent plume (diluted by 1600 times before it reaches the surface) surfaces only 4.8% of the time at the Macaulay outfall and 1.7% at Clover point. Occasional bacterial tests have detected this diluted plume. But there is no evidence that it represents a public health risk – based on a comprehensive study of potential human exposure.  http://www.rstv.ca/is-victoria-dumping-raw-sewage/    This system has proved to be very effective in ensuring the effluent is treated by this oxygen- rich marine environment.  The perceptions of an adverse effect on the marine environment need to be challenged   -Dr Shaun Peck (the Medical Officer of Health for the CRD from 1989-1995)  http://www.rstv.ca/a-plant-we-dont-need/"

Somewhere along the way this just stopped being interesting.  There's a lot of frustrating things about Future Shop, mostly to do with how much their commission system effects the shopping experience there. A few examples:   It's the only store I ever go to where I would see groups of employees standing around socializing in the middle of the store more often than not. If I'm not looking at something expensive I'm basically ignored due to the commission system. Almost every time I'd go to buy something there, a salesman would try to 'help me out on another till' as I walked to checkout. This is obviously someone trying to get commission for a sale and it's a turnoff because it makes the employees seem like vultures, especially after seeing groups of them socializing and ignoring you as mentioned in the previous point. I don't blame the employees for this really. It's a flaw in Future Shop's customer service design which creates a bad experience for customers and they should have addressed it long ago. Even when employees do help you out, it never feels genuine. I'm looking at headphones and I'm ignored. I'm looking at TVs and someone wants to help me. Again, I think this is due to the commission system casting a taint over all of the interactions that I have with staff. Customer service needs to feel genuine. The Brick has this same problem. There's absolutely nothing special about shopping there. Customer service is poor and prices are average/poor. They don't have anything that makes them interesting. If I were them, I'd redesign the method by which I pay my employees and I would invest that $200 million into improving customer service. If they can make people like me enjoy going to Future Shop again, then we'll start buying stuff from Future Shop again."

EVERYONE pushed them, we sold hundreds of them because of it. i remember selling six of them in one day lol. if someone grabbed one and started walking to the door staff would literally trip over each other to try and nab it before they reached checkout.   the guys not helping with headphones are morons, they are pure margin and really helped push your gross margin if you sold them. some had good commission too with company's like bose and beats etc."

Computers are faster but the demo units in stores are often off or have not software worth trying on them. Even Apple stuff is just thinner.   Smaller cameras, MP3 players, and cell phones are all wrapped up into cell phones now, have been for years, and are basically variations on small black rectangles that run the same apps.  PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo stuff all feels very samey to the last generation. And as an avid PS3 owner, I can't help but notice that a lot of Next Gen stuff sounds like its all about over selling DLC and pre-orders (Destiny, Titanfall, Evolve, Battlefield Cops) and then releasing lack luster and buggy product.   The most exciting tech stuff like 3D printers and VR should be heralded by Future Shop/Best Buy. Instead I'm sure they'll sell the same stuff as Walmart when it comes out.   I used to work at Future Shop. Hated selling the warranties. But I'm not surprised its closing. How tech exists in peoples lives, how normal so much of it seems, has changed a lot in 5 years, and FS hasn't.   I just feel sad for the people who are losing their jobs."

The employees at best buy were very friendly but had almost no knowledge of their products. It was annoying. I'll  take someone trying to make a commission if it means they have some insight into what they are selling.   I wasnt surprised best buy failed but i am surprised future shop is switching brands."
VictoriaBC,30lrn8,canucksrule,3,Tue Mar 31 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"I found this as well. Though as a previous FS employee and someone semi-knowledgeable about technology, I often caught FS employees just agreeing with me or telling me what I wanted to hear rather than actually knowing what they were talking about. The art of bullshitting. On more than one occasion I had to call the salesperson out on basically giving false information. Atleast the bestbuy folks arent afraid to admit when they dont know something.  Though to be fair this happens just about everywhere. I recently bought a 120hz tv from visions cause the salesperson said I could connect to my pc thru hdmi and get 120hz. This turned out not to be true at all, since apparently tvs wont accept a signal higher than 60hz even when advertised as higher.   At the end of the day though, I always blame myself for not conducting enough research on the subject."

VictoriaBC,30lrn8,nrtphotos,5,Sat Mar 28 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"i'm honestly a little sad to see this. i worked at the cloverdale store when i was a teenager for about three years and had the time of my life. the money was VERY good, and the environment was always a lot of fun to be in. the commission structure was extremely lucrative if you were strong in sales, and warranty commission and spiffs on certain products were far better than most other sales jobs in the electronics industry.   around the time they made the switch to uptown they made some very poor business decisions. they opened up the best buy across the street, and began laying off or firing some of their strongest staff to try and save money. they also fought tooth and nail to steal sales from best buy through heavy discounting and selling below cost just to move more volume. they also changed the commission structure to a much less profitable system that made it difficult for sales staff to make packages and close sales.   people hated future shop but from a former employee i will never forget my time there. it was a greasy place to work, but we had a very solid team at cloverdale and guys like muhammad were making over 350k a year in commission from electronic sales!

VictoriaBC,30lrn8,copperlight,3,Sat Mar 28 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"Why would they fight 'tooth and nail' against Best Buy? They're the same company since 2001! From a consumer standpoint, the only difference is one is red and one is blue. Not that I'm trying to say you're wrong, but competing with themselves seems kind of stupid.  In fact, it sounds to me like they deliberately moved many of the Future Shops and Best Buys together (Wikipedia notes that many of them were practically right next to each other). That way when one closes people will naturally gravitate to the nearby Best Buy.  Not that there's any real competition these days. Where else are people going to shop for convenient, albeit overpriced and poor selection of electronics?"
VictoriaBC,30lrn8,nrtphotos,3,Sat Mar 28 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"because management was paid bonuses etc with volume sold and a bunch of other different factors. i specifically remember having a big staff meeting when the langford best buy opened about how were were going to ruin them and that we were to close sales no matter what the cost was. the idea with having them close together was that the money was ending up in the same pocket, but greed took over on the store level. the future shop stores were commission and the staff and management didn't want to loose sails to the ""competition""."
VictoriaBC,30lrn8,jimmyvic,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:45:50 2015 UTC,Most electronic prices are reasonable.  The mark up on TV's and Laptops is quite small.  You're paying 2-5% more to shop in a store.  (Some things especially accessories have huge markups) but the big purchases are quite competitive.

VictoriaBC,30hux2,james121345,2,Sat Mar 28 01:37:50 2015 UTC,You're wrong. Cyclists can ONLY pass vehicles on the right side if they are driving in dedicated bicycle lanes. If they are on a normal road they must behave like motor vehicle and obey the rules of the road. Meaning they cannot pass cars on the right side.   Do any internet search on bicycle laws in BC and you'll see you are wrong.

But vehicles can only pass on the left if they're passing with sufficient safe passing distance --- I think it's defined as 2 meters, with motorcycles in mind.

VictoriaBC,30hux2,james121345,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Some injury law from 2008 solidifies this position:   Reasons for judgment were released today finding a Plaintiff cyclist 100% at fault for a 2004 collision between his bicycle and a concrete mixer truck. The collision was significant and resulted in severe injuries. In order for these to be compensable someone needs to be at fault for them. That’s what this trial focused on. Here the Plaintiff was driving on the shoulder of the roadway approaching an intersection. The concrete mixer truck was attempting a right hand turn and the Plaintiff collided with the truck. The court made some useful comments about the duties of cyclists who choose to drive on the shoulder of the road rather than on the roadway itself, namely that: [55] The evidence clearly establishes that Mr. Sivasubramaniam failed to meet the standard of care required of a driver in the circumstances, and that he was negligent. He was driving on the shoulder of the roadway, rather than in the lane marked for vehicle travel. I accept that it would also have been hazardous for Mr. Sivasubramaniam to ride in a driving lane on such a busy street, but having chosen to ride in an area that is not designated for vehicles; and to pass vehicles on the right hand side while travelling in that area, Mr. Sivasubramaniam had a duty to take extra care to ensure that he was visible to drivers, and that he took precautions. This was particularly so as he approached a busy intersection. Options available to him included signalling and moving into the driving lane to his left when it was safe to do so, and proceeding through the intersection in that driving lane; or stopping and dismounting from his bicycle and crossing the intersection in the pedestrian crosswalk and then remounting his vehicle on the other side of Blue Mountain Street. [56] At the very least, he ought to have slowed his bicycle and to have checked carefully for indications that vehicles were intending to turn right from Lougheed Highway onto Blue Mountain Street, before proceeding across the intersection to the right of traffic in the driving lanes...   http://bc-injury-law.com/blog/tag/bicycle-accident  However, as noted below, there are cases where cyclists who are struck by a right-turning vehicle where there are no bike lanes may be considered only partially at fault.  No law relieves a motor vehicle driver of the requirement to ensure that the path is clear prior to putting the wheel over."

If you are going to legally be allowed to roll around in the street with a bunch of death machines you should be required to protect yourself.  Cyclists have to wear helmets and so should skateboarders. If a skateboarder gets in an accident with a car the car will win 100% of the time. And aside from possibly killing the skateboarder, that is a very traumatic thing for the driver as well.  I don't see how it's such an outrageous idea to want people who are riding alongside vehicles to wear a helmet. Is there a valid argument against helmets aside from they don't look cool?"
VictoriaBC,30hux2,who-bah-stank,0,Sat Mar 28 17:50:01 2015 UTC,Mandatory bike helmets don't reduce the number hospital trips for cyclists. They do reduce the number of cyclists though. Not a great example to use.

VictoriaBC,30hux2,who-bah-stank,2,Fri Mar 27 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Did you look at the link?    It is clear that cyclist fatalities did not fall at any greater rate than for other road users after law enforcement in 1994, particularly in view of the reduction in cycling popularity caused by the mandatory helmet legislation."
VictoriaBC,30hux2,NoRegretsCoyote,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"But that means helmets do make it safer because the number of deaths per cyclist went down. If some people chose to stop riding instead of wearing a helmet then that's up to them. If the goal is to get people cycling as much as possible it is a failure. If the goal is safety, then it is a success."
VictoriaBC,30hux2,barfoob,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"No. If the death rate for cyclists is falling at x% per year before the helmet law, and continues falling at that rate (or slower) after the helmet law, then the helmet law is a failure as a public safety policy. Since it discourages cycling it is doubly a failure as public health policy and triply a failure as urban design policy.   Look through the data and the plots there and try to find one that shows a marked increase in cycling safety immediately after 1994.   Edit: Don't trust me, here's the peer reviewed version."
VictoriaBC,30hux2,NoRegretsCoyote,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"There are lots of different types of accidents for cyclists and many of them don't invovle the head hitting the ground, plus if it does they still likely will hurt some other part of their body. The helmuts are a still a HUGE help though. If it wasn't for his helmut my dad could have had a serious head/brain injury from a cycling accident several years ago where he landed head first.

VictoriaBC,30hux2,Ialmostthewholepost,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:33:59 2015 UTC,I agree there as well. It's kind of ridiculous that you can take a driver test once when you're 16 and then legally drive for the next 80 years without some kind of test to make sure you still can safely operate a vehicle.

VictoriaBC,30hux2,Brocket-99,3,Fri Mar 27 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"Half-men are fine.  It's the fact that they all have children of their own, and we have to deal with their satan-spawn acting out in public.  You don't ever have to grow up, until you have kids - then grow the fuck up - fast."
VictoriaBC,30hux2,rednightmare,7,Fri Mar 27 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"not sidewalks like I see often   Well, that's still not actually allowed. This change allows the skateboarders to use the bicycle lane. It also makes it so bylaw enforcers can no longer seize skateboards from offenders (which is actually what started this whole thing 3 years ago)."

VictoriaBC,30ijaz,Drunkturtle,9,Fri Mar 27 17:51:21 2015 UTC,Hank's Untraditional BBQ is my choice for best bbq in town. The name fits though - untraditional food. But damn good.
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,LeftHandedOctopus,2,Fri Mar 27 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"Seconding Hanks. They are fantastic for bbq. Although, sadly, I've not tried ribs there. However, if any of their ribs are anything like their other dishes, they are sure to be awesome."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,monkey_monkey_monkey,3,Sat Mar 28 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Thirding Hank's.  Not many people seem to know about it.  Really great bbq, superior to Pig in my opinion (and I love Pig's sandwiches), although I can't speak to their ribs specifically.  Now I'm curious - This weekend I think I might have to go see if they've got ribs and how good they are.  I also had some great ribs at Brewery and the Beast last summer from local places on the island, but I can't remember the names of the places because let's face it, I was drunk."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,slothjizz,-2,Sat Mar 28 00:47:42 2015 UTC,"He is in a terrible location, hopefully they can make a go of it."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,Notnoodles,2,Sat Mar 28 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"They were packed tonight, with people waiting out on the street. I don't think they're struggling at all, and I wouldn't consider the location to be ""terrible""."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,LeftHandedOctopus,6,Sat Mar 28 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"The unforgettable Cherry Bank Hotel sadly now demolished to make condominiums, regularly would win a venerable international food contest for the unsurpassed quality of their ribs.

Just had dinner at Hank's BBQ - there is a ""brontosaurus beef rib"" on special. It is amazing. It is fantastic. It is as close to a religious experience as I feel like having.   Talking to the owners/chefs there, they don't even make money on things like this - they bring them in for their own pleasure, and cook a few for special lucky folk.  Honestly, just ""unf"". Such a good slab of meat. I am such a happy fat man right now."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,LeftHandedOctopus,3,Sun Mar 29 03:29:36 2015 UTC,I know this doesn't help your current situation but make sure you pencil in rib fest to your calendar.  I go every year and i am never disappointed with any of the rib vendors.

Smoken' Bones used to do half-decent ribs, but they're gone. Pig does okay ribs, but there are better things on their menu. Both Montana's and Earl's do a fairly standard rack of ribs that'll scratch the itch if need be, but they're not proper smoked ribs.   I had to buy a wood-pellet-fired smoker last year because there just isn't anywhere to get a proper rack of slow-smoked BBQ ribs. If anyone finds a new place for ribs, I'd love to know about it.  Keep an eye out for Rib Fest this summer. Good lord, there are some incredible ribs to be found there."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,EnsignRedshirt,3,Fri Mar 27 19:13:45 2015 UTC,The last time I went to Montana's I was not impressed with what was served. Burnt and dry. Not good.

VictoriaBC,30ijaz,KittyMonster,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"Pig's ribs are BS. They don't even peel the membrane off the bone side before cooking, which is just lazy.  Surprisingly, Haro's in Sidney has awesome ribs served with a tasty side of mac & cheese.  Darcy's ribs are good in a pinch."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,marklar2000,-3,Fri Mar 27 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on the style of ribs, Smoke'n Bones and Pig are both good.  Pig is more Kansas style, and Smoken Bones is more jamacian/spicy style."
VictoriaBC,30ijaz,Shawn68z,9,Fri Mar 27 18:21:05 2015 UTC,Except that Smoken Bones has been closed since June 2014. And they went horribly downhill since they moved out of Langford anyways.

The people are so nice from the moment you walk in the door, I really felt like they cared about me and not just my insurance policy. They have an anxiety specialist on site and two therapy dogs. The TLC program is great if you need some time to relax before your dental work. Dr.  Alex is a really nice guy, a bit on the quirky side but a fantastic doctor with a good sense of humour. They are also nonjudgmental."
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,Jenavecia,6,Fri Mar 27 03:08:05 2015 UTC,Seconding. I absolutely love them.
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,rachael_bee,4,Fri Mar 27 03:51:46 2015 UTC,I agree. Dr. Alex even has electric blankets for comfort and Netflix in the ceiling with WiFi headphones (distractions!) and he only charges the minimum amount. They also accept direct billing to your insurance. Good luck!
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,almoststarvingartist,3,Fri Mar 27 03:56:39 2015 UTC,Hmm that look like a really good office! It might be a really good match for me.
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,MarbleNarwhal,3,Fri Mar 27 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"They're wonderful!! Dr. Alex is great; very patient and kind. And they will walk you through everything they do as they do it and go as slowly as you need them to. :) I have realllyyy bad anxiety when i go to the dentist--like, full on hyperventilating and panic attacks--and I was recommended to InHarmony. They specialize in anxious patients--you can even do a counseling appointment beforehand and they have therapy dogs and everything and it's great (costs extra of course).   They're also quite high-tech I think. And if you have the money, I'd really recommend treating yourself to nitrous (laughing gas), especially if you have a hard time at the dentist generally. It is AHMAZING and makes fillings a breeze for me..."
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,Galurana,2,Fri Mar 27 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"Dr Babin and his staff, especially the hygienists are wonderful if you have anxiety. He goes to seminars and conferences several times a year and tends to use very current technology/equipment. I know he has digital x-rays, but I'm not too sure about the ultrasonic cleaning - I just don't pay enough attention to that part of the visit. link   His prices are a bit higher, but I'm pretty sure it's due to him keeping up to date with the latest technology.  I used to be phobic, but can see him without any problems now."
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,Galurana,3,Fri Mar 27 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"I will check out Dr. Babin, thank you!"
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,idlecogz,3,Fri Mar 27 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"My experience with Dr. Babin was negative. His prices are higher, and his ""new tech"" yields sketchy results. Dr. Judith Hooker is the real deal, and has compassion to match her expertise."

The dentist (a lady) that looked at my teeth was so pushy, rude, and condescending my mother ended up cutting the appointment short. Once my mom told the lady we wanted to leave, the dentist started chewing her out and inferred she was a bad parent. We refused to pay that day."

They just moved to a new office so they have lots of shiny new equipment.  http://dentalontheavenue.com/  The only downside is they seem to be more expensive than average (certainly more expensive than my wife's dentist).
VictoriaBC,30g6qg,z781,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:34:31 2015 UTC,Hmm... more expensive than average is a bit of a concern. Is she really nice? Are her hygienists gentle?

VictoriaBC,30f49z,occidental_oriental,23,Thu Mar 26 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"Yes they are expensive, but the selection is also very unique. Lots of healthy fast options in the frozen food section, including lots of vegetarian and vegan products. The deli is mind-blowing, all sorts of crazy things one example is different types of crusted and marinated baked tofu. The wood fired pizza is better than any thin crust pizza in victoria. The cheese section is insane with selections from the world over. A fantastic coffee shop with loads of baked treats that simply put makes starbucks embarrassed . Massive bakery with an astonish selection. My favourite thing by far about Wholefoods though, and this is something nobody in Victoria is even making a half hearted attempt at is the ""salad bar"", 20 different salads, pasta, soups, rice dishes, etc etc."

VictoriaBC,30f49z,Notnoodles,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:59:17 2015 UTC,4? They are supposed to serve with 1 in the middle. You are not paying 14$ for basil leaves!
VictoriaBC,30f49z,gas12n,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:31:10 2015 UTC,"Also if your out in Langford ever, 900 degrees in the millstream mall serves excellent wood fired pizza.  Far superior to prima strada in my opinion.  They also make everything (from pasta to deserts) in house. Though its pretty small and gets extremely busy during regular dinner hours.  Edit:: Quick comment on their menu, it is more Italian in its roots so they may not have many of the ""traditional"" North American toppings."

VictoriaBC,30f49z,mopardriver,9,Sat Mar 28 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Whole Foods only stocks organic and ""natural"" (there is a lot of controversy around their natural marketing, hence the scare quotes) foods. They tend to buy local produce and meats when they can, but they also have very specific requirements on what they stock so places like the Root Cellar, local markets and maybe even Thriftys will still have them beat if you want to buy local. On the other hand, if you care about GMO, ethical meat and that type of thing then you will like WF.  Expect Whole Foods to be priced similar to Market on Yates, maybe even a little more. In other words, they will be more expensive for most things.  Whole Foods will also have a lot of specialty foods that the other stores won't have. If I were Lifestyle Markets, I would be very concerned about Whole Foods coming to town. I imagine they will be cheaper and have greater variety when it comes to that sort of thing because they have a lot more buying power.  The various Whole Foods locations can be quite different. I remember being to on in... Portland, I think, where they would bbq meat for you right there in the store."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,rednightmare,3,Thu Mar 26 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"If I were Lifestyle Markets, I would be very concerned about Whole Foods coming to town. I imagine they will be cheaper and have greater variety when it comes to that sort of thing because they have a lot more buying power.   Lifestyle is surprisingly competitive on most dry goods. For example, they're one of the cheapest sources in town for almond milk, vegan protein powder and gluten-free oats. I haven't costed their produce. I suspect they make most of their profit on vitamins, but then so does every other store that sells vitamins."

The organic trend is incredibly destructive to the environment... for example, organic farms chop down rainforests to grow bananas instead of using a harmless fungicide... GMO crops on average require less biocide application and increase yields and decrease carbon emissions."

VictoriaBC,30f49z,rednightmare,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"Organics require no biocide. They don't require insecticide either, so we don't run into nasty little issues like the resistant corn borers with the GMO corn.   Have you ever heard of the mycelial network? Fungicide isn't harmless when an entire pillar of the ecosystem is the fungal network, both above and below the soil.  For the record, I'm not against GMO's in concept. But our execution in agriculture thus far has been ignorant and dangerous."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,derekja,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:37:29 2015 UTC,"It's very strange, Andy, when I see a comment from myself that I only mostly agree with. I may have to consider logging out from Reddit! In this particular case, I fully agree with the bananas comment that you were replying to. Organic bananas are incredibly destructive. And unfortunately there is an economic incentive for the banana producers to keep taking new land and leaving the old plantations behind since they can then sell that land for other purposes, so being able to claim that they can't use fungicides plays right into that. I would love to see a GMO banana that is black sigatoka resistant. We're not that far from losing commercial banana production altogether if that doesn't happen, but it's sure going to cause devastation along the way."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,derekja,-7,Sat Apr 11 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"Don't go to the Root Cellar, everything is extremely overpriced and Thrifties has the same quality stuff at cheaper prices."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,GameAddikt,5,Fri Mar 27 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"That's amazing to hear someone say that. I find Thrifty's (especially their produce) to be very expensive compared to the root cellar. That being said, I always hit the great mid week sales and watch their weekend deals to get the best price.   The sad thing about grocery shopping now is that you have to hit 2-3 different stores over the weekend to stock up for the week (family of 5). We hit superstore in colwood for the staples and dry goods (typically pretty awful produce), maybe the root cellar if there's some good deals or country grocer for produce and maybe a Costco run every 2 or 3 weeks. I also work next to a Save-on so if there's a deal on something there I'll stop after work and load up.   When the flyers come on Friday we scan each one and make our plan. It sucks but to spend a reasonable amount on groceries it's what we have to do. I miss when I was single and if just got Thriftys after work and get everything I need but I shudder to think what that would cost now.  I can't see myself shopping too much at whole foods but I've been to them in the states and it's pretty fucking awesome. Salad bars and fresh fruit for days and an amazing deli/bakery. I'm near Uptown so I'll stop by for lunch."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,bcballer411,7,Fri Mar 27 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"When you walk in, you notice how shiny and new the building is. Everything is coloured in earth tones, and yet, it's so colourful. Then you notice next that there are a lot of food items in here. Like, a lot, and quite the variety of things too. While you are browsing everything from Whole Foods brand frozen pizza to organic face cream, you notice that you're a little bit lost. You have to take a look around briefly to understand your surroundings. Once again, man, what a nice store. Then you look down at ths frozen pizza again and see that it is $15. You consider this briefly, and decide that based on the plain, unremarkable looks of this pizza and it's pricetag that you won't be buying this particular pizza. As you begin to wrap up your loop of the store, you feel confident that you can find what you need in here as far as groceries go since there are so many things. You leave feeling satisfied knowing that you can find something good quality in this store, but perhaps you're better off at your usual grocery store for most basic grocery items.  That's what it's like for me anyways. I like Whole Foods for quality treats and such, but I don't always choose to go there."

VictoriaBC,30f49z,orangeisthebestcolor,5,Thu Mar 26 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"Whole Foods is an experience in itself, a health food nut's version of an expensive Superstore. As a veggie lover, I'm excited to hear about whole foods coming to Victoria. They tend to have a more expansive selection of consistently fresh, quality veggies, unlike some of the sad Save On's experiences I've had in Vic. Though, they won't beat the Root Cellar's prices. Their bulk section of grains and nuts is decent too. Because it's so expensive, I don't go there for everyday groceries, just once in a while as a treat and to eat from their AMAZING deli."
VictoriaBC,30f49z,Sebastidae,2,Thu Mar 26 23:19:16 2015 UTC,Root cellar for cheaper and better quality veggies etc then any grocery store

They have so many healthy and delicious takeout options in their deli. They also have a lot of neat snacks that you can't find anywhere else. Personally I wouldn't do all of my shopping there because it is too expensive for me, but I think it's a great addition to the city. It's also a good place to go if you have any number of real food allergies or sensitivities."

We are turning the space into one of the premier offices in Victoria, and we'll be there long term—we're not a startup (I.E we actually make money, and have since we started business over 8 years ago.)   Look forward to being a proactive part of solving the downtown Victoria vacancy issue.

I would like to see the city get more proactive downtown, if something is vacant too long force them to sell it or fine them every day it sits empty.   How would that work exactly? The landlords have fee simple ownership, I don't think that would even be constitutional."
VictoriaBC,30aizd,Notnoodles,2,Thu Mar 26 20:39:57 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, write a new city bylaw ? Naybe any building that sits vacant for more than 18 months pays double property tax. The health of downtown relies on it being vibrant and alive, not shuttered and delapitated. I would start with the Cineplex building downtown which Thriftys or its parent company owns, use it as a test, force them to lay out a plan or sell it, if not start the fines."
VictoriaBC,30aizd,HotterRod,4,Thu Mar 26 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"The best solution that I've heard is to institute Land Value Taxation, where the property tax is assessed based on the land's potential revenue rather than actual. Right now a building like the Janion is paying almost no property tax, because it's not worth very much and if they redevelop it the property tax will go up (which decreases the incentive to redevelop it). Under land value taxation the Janion will pay the same property tax regardless of the state of the building, so there will be a strong incentive to develop it to its full revenue potential. Of course zoning also needs to get out of way for that system to work."

VictoriaBC,30aizd,jordoonearth,2,Thu Mar 26 07:35:35 2015 UTC,It's not a very suitable space for a kitchen unfortunately. There are very few fixtures that would allow for a restaurant without drastic and extensive renovations. The area could be used for a retail storefront or possibly something like an office space. Unfortunately that market is somewhat flooded in Victoria at the moment. It is a very nice space though for sure.
VictoriaBC,30aizd,timw11,2,Wed Mar 25 21:04:49 2015 UTC,It would be a pretty difficult space and would require a huge renovation to get a commercial kitchen in there.   That's probably why it's becoming an office space :-) (Source: one of it's owners)

I think if you're asked about credit, just be upfront.

Credit score is definitely a good thing to maintain in life and it sounds like you are getting yours in check.   With ROMS I get to run a credit check for $8.95 each time. For my last run of potential tenants I shortlisted everybody based on their application to 10 (seriously people, fill out the entire application, missing a section or leaving a gap in your residency wont help your cause). From those 10 I call their references taking into account work & past landlord references having more weight than a personal reference.     Once I narrow it down to 3-5 potentials yeah I'll run a credit check on my top pick, if its good il give them a call to let them know the place is theirs, if they have found a place already I more onto the next and rinse & repeat.   However it isnt the be all and end all. If the person is approchable, friendly and comes off as a good person while at the same time having work references that confirm that they are A) employed and B) will be for the foreseeable future those are more important to me than if they don't have a prefect score. Obviously if they have an absolute dreadful credit score as in a fail then there would be some doubt.  If the landlord or rental company is a member of ROMS then request that they go online to TVS (tenant verification services) and update your record of your lease showing that you made your rents payments in full and on time. If they do this then it will help your credit score a lot and when future landlords with ROMS run a check they can see that you made payments on time for X months with this place."

If you are good at chatting with seniors, as well as getting the job done at a reasonable rate, you should have no shortage of customers.  There are a lot of companies though so it is competitive.  Word of mouth works far better than advertising to gain clients.  Garden centre work is seasonal, many lay off their staff in the winter and/or have extended holiday closures.

Then took it to the Supreme Court of Canada and lost again.  I'm not very good at decoding legaleeze, but it looks like it was argued under Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for ""not to be deprived of life, liberty or security of the person""  I think the argument hinges on the illegality of possession and that protected core of provincial power does not override Federal Law on Controlled Drugs and Substances.  Harm reduction should be one of the core values of our healthcare system, it would mitigate so many issues that can be either prevented or reduced.  The InSite program has proven that harm reduction is an effective method of caring for drug users, specifically intravenous users.  To ignore the obvious success of this program and to try to force users back onto the street to shoot up using puddle water and a dirty syringe is evil in my mind.  I can see how people looking at this program from a skewed perspective could see it as encouraging drug use, but this argument is laughable at best.

I'd suggest you read a little about the benefits of harm reduction facilities and programs rather than abstinence based programs. The entire harm reduction article on wikipedia is well worth a read if you're unfamiliar with the principles of harm reduction.  But more specifically, the section on alcohol is particularly illuminating as it relates to your suggestion that individuals only gain access to care services if they are sober. This section is really interesting:   Toronto's Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a ""wet shelter"" on a ""managed alcohol"" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities and a study of Ottawa's ""wet shelter"" found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half.[72] The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006 found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to emergency rooms drop to an average of eight a month from 13.5 while encounters with the police fall to an average of 8.8 from 18.1.   Try to approach this issue from a different perspective and hopefully you'll see that everything is not black and white as you propose."

To me this seems like poor reasoning if you have any interest in greater social well being, because there is no scientifically credible debate about whether the principle of harm reduction is effective in general.  Simply put, harm reduction reduces harm in every situation where it has been employed.  Your views are in line with conservative political philosophies which suggest that because drug users are basically bad folks, assistance to them should come at little to no cost.

This is because landlords usually don't know until the last week of the month if their tenant is moving out. Sept is a bit of a different scenario in Victoria though because there is usually more empty units in the summer & then a big rush to fill them.  There are exceptions where a landlord may hold a unit empty for a month but not often. I'm a landlord with an empty suite ready to rent and someone emailed me a few weeks ago asking if I would hold it until sept 1 which is stupid and wastes everyone's time."

VictoriaBC,305bh7,Violentpurrs,11,Tue Mar 24 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the threat is a reaction or a symptom of the real problem. The homeowner is clearly frustrated with cats crapping in their yard - people are required to clean up after their dogs, but cats are free to destroy property? Perhaps the solution lies in consideration and cooperation.  I'd love to find an excuse to build a curfew pet door. When the cats come in for dinner in the evening, the door could have its one-way latch set and the pets remain indoor for the night. There are many other solutions available as commercial products.  Of course, this kind of solution only solves a piece of the issue and the homeowner will likely still have to chase off other cats if there are any.  We all have responsibilities, gardening citizens and pet owners alike."
VictoriaBC,305bh7,emcniece,9,Tue Mar 24 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"You are assuming the cat owner is not being responsible.

The person who gave the cat an 'unpleasant night' and threatened further harm could have sent a note saying 'I would like to meet to discuss ways we might keep your cat from digging up my garden - please contact soandso' or whatever their issue was. They chose to go to an extreme instead. That makes it the note-writers problem, they went to threats and harm instead of any attempt at cooperation."

They wander through my fenced yard day and night, they crap everywhere in my gardens including the one I eat from. Not even my dog does that.  They leave dead birds or rodents everywhere.  I frequently find them in my yard or worse in my driveway or on my car. Yes, my fucking car.  Thats the same car they hide under in the morning before I leave for work. It's disgusting. And frequently those cats also spend unpleasant nights outside in less than ideal weather. I can hear them meowing for hours. Nothing ominous about that except yet another irresponsible pet owner."

VictoriaBC,305bh7,kittykittychoochoo,19,Sat Mar 28 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"I think the title should read, ""'Your cat has spent an unpleasant night' - ominous note worries irresponsible Vancouver Island pet owners""  If you let your cat roam outside during the day so it can crap in other peoples yards, kill and terrorize the local bird population, fight other cats, and run into the roads to get splattered by a car, then you have absolutely no moral grounds to judge someone who catches it in a cage then delivers it to the local SPCA.  You have already proved that you have no regard for your pet's safety so why should anyone else?  Would I ever confine a cat in cage this way? No - but I do understand why people get frustrated.  People who would deliberately harm a cat are psychos though.  If you are a cat owner you are responsible for it, even when it isn't in your yard.  If you can't accept this responsibility or believe that your cat has a right to roam the neighbourhood at will, then you need to give your cat up for adoption or keep it indoors.  Having the SPCA issue fines is a great way to encourage responsible pet ownership in the community and generate funds to take care of the truly neglected pets that need it."
VictoriaBC,305bh7,Decapentaplegia,-2,Tue Mar 24 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"You have already proved that you have no regard for your pet's safety   Bullshit. Letting a cat go outdoors is an act of compassion, keeping it confined in a cage or even indoors is inhumane. Why do people assume they have a right to an unpooped-upon lawn? Deer, squirrels, raccoons... they do more damage than cats.  Cat poop is part of life, it's not something we should actively work to eradicate. Cats are predatory animals, they deserve to be outdoors. They aren't objects, as you seem to imply by your belief that the threat of being splattered by a car outweighs their right to prowl."
VictoriaBC,305bh7,Pahalial,6,Tue Mar 24 23:01:36 2015 UTC,Bullshit. Outdoor domesticated cats are an indefensible human-inflicted threat to actual wildlife.

VictoriaBC,305bh7,Decapentaplegia,-2,Thu Mar 26 04:44:39 2015 UTC,Comparing cats to dogs is... comparing apples to oranges.
VictoriaBC,305bh7,mopardriver,0,Thu Mar 26 05:35:46 2015 UTC,Both are pets? Check.  Both have bylaw re no roaming in the CRD? Check.  Both will be picked up by animal control if found loose? Check. Both predatory in nature? Check.  Both can be trained? Check.  Cat comes into my dogs yard and gets bitten? And its onlt my dogs fault? Your crazy.  The cat should be indoors or supervised outdoors and not left to wander. Not some irresponsible pet owners idea of taking care of their animals by letting them roam.
VictoriaBC,305bh7,Decapentaplegia,-3,Thu Mar 26 19:30:59 2015 UTC,Animals aren't possessions. You have a very narrow view of what a pet is.  Dogs aren't allowed to roam for obvious reasons - being incapable to survive in the wild is one of the more important reasons - whereas cats are allowed to roam because they can take care of themselves and pose little to no threat. Supervising an outdoor cat? Are you joking?
VictoriaBC,305bh7,mopardriver,-2,Thu Mar 26 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"Bull shit that Dogs can't take care of them selves.  There are feral dogs, and I've seen my dog kill rodents and wouldn't hesitate to kill and eat a rabbit given a chance for that matter.  They would handle themselves just fine if they had to.  The difference is we spend a long time training a dog what they can and cannot eat. A properly trained cat is completely plausible.  My co-workers cat does exactly that.  Goes out side, craps in his yard and immediately comes when called.  I've seen feral and outside cats go after small children no different than a wild dog will.  My cousin is petrified of cats because an outdoor cat attacked her when she was younger and it was in her yard.  Seriously you're the individual here with a narrow view of what you can teach a domesticated animal.    Also, my pet is my family, no different than a child.  However, in the eyes of the law damage that my pet does, excrement or otherwise are my responsibility.  So should it be the same with cats.  The response, ""My cat is an outdoor cat so if it poops in your yard is not my problem"" attitude is ridiculous."

If that pet is given away or euthanized, it becomes much worse. Imagine someone stealing or killing your pet for any reason. It's unacceptable.   I get that some people don't like the fact that cats might poop in their garden. I have a lot of neighbourhood cats (and racoons, and even once a deer) that come through here and like a normal, non-psychotic human being, I let them go their way unharmed. Their poop isn't going to set my house on fire. It's not going to destroy my garden.   If you don't want animals to come into your yard, get a fence, and a big one. Even then it won't keep them all out, because every night and day there are all sorts of animals traipsing through there without you ever being the wiser.

Trying to convince someone to keep their cat on a leash, who think a cat should roam free, is a useless task and will only raise tension within a neighbourhood."
VictoriaBC,305bh7,Great68,-2,Wed Mar 25 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"As a private citizen of course you can take an animal to the pound. Knowingly taking someone else's pet to the pound is another matter entirely. It's like I found your bike on my lawn one day and instead of returning it to your lawn or talking to you about it, I took it to a local lost and found instead, or a thrift store, or a dump.   If you have a problem with cats coming onto your property, talk to your neighbours, and see if you can come to a solution. There are quite a few ways to keep cats out of your yard and you can discuss this with your neighbours.   The best suggestion there - which really works in my experience - is the small sandbox in the cat owner's yard. The cats use it like an outdoor litterbox and the owner cleans it up periodically. Problem solved. We have one in our backyard and we have never had a complaint about our cat using anyone else's yard as a toilet (he's a former stray that freaks out if he can't go outside, he goes once a day for about half an hour and stays almost exclusively in our yard). A lot of people probably don't know about this solution and it really works. I'm certain that most people would build one if the alternative was some crazy neighbour trapping and potentially hurting their pet.   If you really think politely talking to people will only raise tension, what do you think covertly trapping and sending their animals to the pound, where their pet might get given away or euthanized, would accomplish?"
VictoriaBC,305bh7,BusyBeesAreBusy,-2,Wed Mar 25 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the old ""ad hominem"" attack.  Keep track of your property.

VictoriaBC,305bh7,Decapentaplegia,4,Wed Mar 25 10:54:49 2015 UTC,"If you left your bicycle on my lawn, I wouldn't steal it and I wouldn't destroy it. I would move it to the side of the road and leave it there. Similarly, a cat can be discouraged with a motion sensing sprinkler if they bother you so much.   You don't have the right to trap or euthanize someone else's pet simply because it was on your property, that's willfully and knowingly causing harm. Not only are you hurting an animal that doesn't know better, you're traumatizing other people by harming their pet.  If you are so pissed off about your neighbour's cat possibly pooping in your yard, go talk to your neighbour. If it were me, I'd buy you the motion sensing sprinkler to keep my neighbour happy. Because normal people work problems out."
VictoriaBC,305bh7,Great68,-4,Wed Mar 25 15:50:16 2015 UTC,Bullshit.  It's a simple fact that one's persons' possession is trespassing on another's person's private property.    Why should someone else's decision to let their cat roam free become MY problem?
VictoriaBC,305bh7,onemorepost,4,Wed Mar 25 01:01:18 2015 UTC,That is a very presumptive philosophy. You can't assume your neighbours share your values. Raccoons poop in your yard too.

I have a dog who uses my yard as his toilet. I clean up after him as required. I also clean up after my neighbour's cats who crap everywhere and leave dead birds and rodents for me to find.  Irresponsible pet owners that allow their cats to roam so they can offload their responsibility onto their community don't deserve to have a pet. Flat out.

VictoriaBC,304tz4,candrie,12,Tue Mar 24 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"Most of society's rules get enforced by peer pressure rather than police and other professional enforcers because there simply aren't enough enforcers to go around. For example, there's a theory that drivers get mad at cyclists because cyclists break the rules that drivers are enforcing on other drivers. Over time, peer pressure rules get internalized and people police their own activities.  Obviously it's unreasonable to expect that every incidence of public smoking will be enforced by peers at the beginning, but making it illegal empowers people who were near the tipping point of telling people to butt out. Over time, that tipping point will shift so more and more people feel empowered to speak out."

I wasn't even aware of the parks/fields amendment in this update, so that's a pleasant surprise. There will of course be people complaining about ""muh freedoms"" being ""infringed"" upon, but the very act of poisoning the air in close proximity to people that know better and prefer clean air is direct intrusion to their pleasure and well-being. If one insists on maintaining the filthy habit of smoking, at least do so without imposing your carginogenic, toxic, and smelly byproducts unto innocent passersby.  Inconsiderate smokers won't be pleased, but at least more reasonable ones won't mind, and it is beneficial overall for the cleanliness and health of the city and our general hospitality."

VictoriaBC,3033hx,ILoveBabyBats,2,Tue Mar 24 07:31:05 2015 UTC,"I just looked in to a ton of places for my wedding in July  Victoria Golf Club: $1000 venue deposit; $350 setup fee and ridiculously cheap (and delicious) plated meals (this is who we've decided on and so far it's been great!). You don't have to be a member. They also operate as a non-profit, so that is why they have such lower prices.  Our second contender was Sleeping Dog Farm: $1200-2500 depending on if you want a weekend rental/overnight accomodation. No amplified sound systems though.  Other places we looked in to but ultimately ruled out (mostly due to cost)  Bear Mountain  The Beach House Restaurant (this was our third choice)  University Club  Ward Room  Sea Cidery (ruled out only because a good friend got married there)  Old English Inn (ruled out only because a good friend got married there)  Also, I recommend checking out /r/weddingplanning.

VictoriaBC,3033hx,shawnapiranha,2,Tue Mar 24 22:13:09 2015 UTC,"The University Club was very reasonable when I got married there last summer. We had a ceremony on the patio and then moved inside for the cocktail hour and reception.  We provided full meals for 100, as much champagne punch as people could drink (about 2.5 bowls, btw) and two bottles of wine on every table and the whole thing cost about $5.5k, including taxes, gratuity, rental fees, etc, etc.  The food was surprisingly good, but the best part was that we were able to do pretty minimal decorations because the dining room is surrounded by big, lovely windows that look onto trees and bushes and the pond."
VictoriaBC,3033hx,Kathleen_LRR,2,Wed Mar 25 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"http://www.rlcparks.ca/park/Goldstream  You can reserve one or both of the large group campsites, both have lots of room with big grassy areas and the wooden gazebo style structures have water and electricity. If you are having a wedding, book it for the minimum number of people possible because that number is for anyone actually camping overnight, not the total number of wedding guests. Contact the RLC folks first to let them know you want to book it for a wedding and they can let you know the do's and don'ts (e.g if you have tents, don't use longer than 6 inch stakes because of the underground water lines for the sprinklers, they can also make sure the place is spruced up the day before).  If you want tables, chairs, tents, etc (even plates and cutlery), go with Saanich Rentals  http://www.saanichrentals.com/  They are much cheaper than any other place we found, and if you rent on Saturday you don't have to return it til Monday (they don't charge for Sunday because they aren't open for you to return it then so you get a free days rental). They don't deliver or pick up on Saturdays though so we wound up renting the campsite for 2 nights so we got everything set up the night before - you don't want to have to worry about setup on the actual day anyways).  If you are going to serve booze you will need a liquor license (just go to any govt liquor store to get the form, you have to fill it out, then go by a police station to get them to sign a section, then the liquor store signs the last bit - costs 40 bucks I think).   I recommend http://www.bitez.ca/ for food - Doug dropped everything off for us, he's great :)"

Then you can take all the ""wedding tax"" money you saved and rent a venue and throw a party for all your friends. I can see how it would be an issue if you want the nice wedding photos and everything.  The other place that I have heard great things about is Brentwood College just over the Malahat. Great price, great food, and many ways to cut costs. The only thing here is you have to get married when school is out of session (May-August). Maybe that works for you. Also, guests can stay in the dorms for extremely cheap."

We ended up spending more money than I would have liked, and while it was a great wedding and I'm very pleased with how it turned out, I regret spending that much.   If I was doing it over again, I would have a smaller wedding and rent out a rural property somewhere and just do everything ourselves. That, or just do a nice meal at a restaurant (which is cheaper, because you don't have to pay for room rental or staff on top of the food).   We did save money on some things though. We purchased pies from Cascadia Bakery for 70 people instead of cake, and it was much, much cheaper than going the traditional cake route (I think it was about $200). After polling some people, we opted not to do guest favours. Nobody noticed or cared. I didn't spend much at all on decorations or flowers because our location was naturally beautiful.   Congratulations, good luck and happy planning!"

VictoriaBC,2zxybg,nrtphotos,3,Mon Mar 23 03:26:54 2015 UTC,I'd like to see something like the I-5 approach just before the Peace Arch crossing - all the lanes gradually get narrower and then do a gentle S-curve before entering the 20 mph/ 30 km/h section of the park and fanning out at Canada Customs.

Given there has been only a single, MINOR accident in recent years on that stretch of road despite literally hundreds of thousands of motorists using it during that time, it does not mean that those who are traveling 34MH/H over the speed limit should be penalized, it means the speed limit should be increased by 30KM/H."

VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Vic2013,15,Mon Mar 23 06:50:19 2015 UTC,"So what you're recommending then is a drop in speed from 80 straight to the 20 km/h when you reach the terminals? That seems dangerous and would most certainly cause problems.  Plus, as someone else noted, the 84 average was of the ticketed speeders, not all traffic.  I just don't understand the attitude against the police issuing speeding tickets. If you don't like getting them, then don't speed. If you're running late, you should have left earlier. The posted limit is the posted limit, doesn't matter why it is, obey it or risk the consequences. It's not a hard concept."

Further, the individual in the article was concerned about making it for 8:30am for a 9:00am sailing, which indicates he had a reservation, for which you need to arrive 30 minutes prior to sailing for it to remain valid.  For a 9:00am sailing, he almost certainly would still make the sailing if he lost his reservation unless it was preceding a major holiday or event.

Here is the spot where the speed limit becomes 50. This is also the  only place on the highway where there are 4 lanes. It's easy to see why many people would hesitate to halve their speed with 4 wide open lanes on a highway.  I'd honestly feel much less safe travelling here at 50 than 80, especially since some drivers rip through this area at as high as 120kph.  Here is an insightful youtube video from a guy in Vancouver, talking about speed limits on marine drive."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Omnistegan,4,Mon Mar 23 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"Given that speed limits should be set by drivers, that doesn't mean the speed that most drivers drive is always the safe speed. Drivers choose their speed based on the geometry of the road, but intersections and, to a greater extent, driveways don't affect that. The logic here would be to realign the road, as mentioned before, with possibly an S-curve or concrete medians that squeeze the traffic into smaller lanes.  Accelerating into an area where people might get apprehensive while switching lanes is certainly not safe. In this case where drivers might be arriving with only seconds to spare it is fair to say that drivers might be a bit wreckless. To say that it's perfectly fine to accelerate into that area is only true if there are no other vehicles there."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,getefix,0,Mon Mar 23 14:41:26 2015 UTC,"This is totally correct.  The big problem is the road, not the speed limit. People should slow down for the ferry booths, but the geometry of the road is designed like a 110 highway, not a 50.   The fact is, most drivers ignore speed limit signs entirely. If the only clue for slowing down is a speed limit sign, most drivers simply won't."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Omnistegan,9,Mon Mar 23 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"People don't like universal income or property tax, so the shortfall comes from people who ""deserve it.""  I will be ticketed eventually on that one stretch where Douglas turns into the highway at uptown.   There is no public safety reason to put the 70 kph sign that far up yet there are massive speed traps.  It requires no stretch of the imagination to figure out why.  Maybe if the revenue was given to charity instead of diverted to city/police coffers we'd see different behaviour."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Bitter_Bert,8,Mon Mar 23 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"I speed there also, but there are driveways (to the fire hall).  I bet that's the reason it changes where it does.  Same thing in the other direction... it drops just before you get the gas station and gateway centre driveways."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Brethon,3,Mon Mar 23 01:45:38 2015 UTC,Fire apparatus also enter the Southbound lanes just after the speed change.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Tweeeked,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:19:34 2015 UTC,I will be ticketed eventually on that one stretch where Douglas turns into the highway at uptown.   I saw cops there mid-afternoon this past Friday! It goes from highway to Douglas so damn quick most people don't even realize they should slow down.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Noelstaar,5,Mon Mar 23 15:28:16 2015 UTC,I haven't done this road heading to Swartz Bay or Tswassen in ages but I would have been roasted on a spit by the cops. I would have gone to jail for ages... There is something about being stuck behind someone driving 7~10kmph slower than the speed limit in front of you when you are on the verge of catching /missing a ferry that makes you want to kick in the nitro and the afterburners down the last stretch of road.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,5,Sun Mar 22 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"Along with losing his car for seven days, he figures his speeding will cost him close to $800 in total, once towing and impound charges are included.   If you're going 40 over, let alone 65 over, you deserve to be out $800. That's an excessive speeding ticket, and a massive point penalty on your license. Endangering not just yourself but others by doing that."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,VelvetJustice,33,Sun Mar 22 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. There's a very short distance from where the speed limit drops from 80 to 50. Furthermore, the road right there is wide and gently curving. It's very commonplace for people to still be going fast as they slowly decelerate while approaching the terminals.  There are better ways to get people to slow down than to lay in wait and spring upon them with tickets in hand. If they really wanted people to slow down, they could put in any sort of actual measures on the road that would force drivers to slow down.  The cops took advantage of the fact that they did not enforce this speed limit the rest of the year to net themselves a tidy amount of $$$. This had nothing to do with keeping people safe at all."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Glenfiddich_18yr,3,Sun Mar 22 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"Its enforced year round, just not every weekend, and the distance to slow down isn't as short as people make it."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,smallpenisweirdchode,7,Mon Mar 23 03:35:40 2015 UTC,I've done the route weekly and if you're going 80 and lift off when the first warning sign comes up you can drop down to 60 pretty easily by the time you enter the 50 zone. When I'm going more than 80 (I usually go 90) I just ease off a bit earlier and I'm good to go.  It's a short distance but not unfairly short.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,ubersteiny,11,Mon Mar 23 05:25:37 2015 UTC,"The area before Swartz Bay is one of the most heavily ticketed in all of North America. If the average fine they issued on each of those 109 tickets was ~$250, the police increased revenue by ~$27,000 in 7 hours in one location. With the amount that they patrol this area throughout the year, they are pulling in hundreds of thousands annually.   Through my years on the island, nothing has changed about that stretch where the limit goes from 80 to 50. No new signs, no blinking lights telling you to slow down, no radar sign that tells you your speed. It's exactly the same.   To me, it's a huge cash grab. It's a fantastic location for the local government to make money. All in the name of public safety"
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,smallpenisweirdchode,2,Mon Mar 23 02:51:31 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for that claim?
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,_pocket_dogs,2,Mon Mar 23 05:56:40 2015 UTC,"The head coach of my hockey team just retired as one of the higher ups within the police department in Victoria. He wasn't a huge fan of the spot because he thought that a lot of the tickets being handed out were to university students that couldn't really afford the tickets in the first place.   As for a legitimate source, all I've really got is his word. I'm not sure if they would publish those sort of stats anywhere."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Sunray21A,4,Mon Mar 23 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"I would add that this area is far outside of Victoria Police's jurisdiction.  It would be Sidney/North Saanich RCMP, Central Saanich Police or IRSU, so Victoria Police would not really have any intimate knowledge of the area as it is not of their concern."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,-2,Mon Mar 23 16:39:47 2015 UTC,Cops have been using that spot for 20 years to give tickets.  Holla Holla dollars bills.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Misinformed_ideas,2,Mon Mar 23 07:06:10 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? Are you justifying this guy who's going buck 20 in a 50 zone? That's like going 65 over in a residential zone. That's ridiculous. Pegging someone for 65 over is a he'll of a lot different than for 5 over. It is a safety concern and drivers who do that should have their vehicle impounded, suspended license, upped insurance and pay up."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,3,Mon Mar 23 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"Can we keep the discussion to the actual event and not get into ""That's like"" scenarios?"
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Misinformed_ideas,4,Mon Mar 23 02:31:47 2015 UTC,"Okay. He's going buck 20 in a 50 zone. Even if it's a rapid 80 - 50 drop he has NO reason to be going that fast and is endangering other drivers, himself and his family. It is that simple. If I got caught doing that, I'd lose my N instantly. He has no regard for other drivers on the road and should NOT be on the road because of it."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,-2,Mon Mar 23 05:16:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to quote /user/Rdub who has the top comment in this thread   f the average amount motorists we're ""Speeding"" was 34KM/H over the speed limit we can assume that according to any normal statistical distribution model, the majority of ALL other motorists are likely ""Speeding"" at a similar rate. Given there has been only a single, MINOR accident in recent years on that stretch of road despite literally hundreds of thousands of motorists using it during that time, it does not mean that those who are traveling 34MH/H over the speed limit should be penalized, it means the speed limit should be increased by 30KM/H.   So, given what this user said (and feel free to fact check), we can assume that by going this speed there is no endangerment to himself nor other drivers on the road."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Misinformed_ideas,2,Mon Mar 23 05:27:47 2015 UTC,"The average motorist is going 84kmh. So how is him going 115 not endangering others? Why do you think its justifiable that he should be able to go 115, in a 50 zone or even an 80? That is a MASSIVE speed difference."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,3,Mon Mar 23 05:43:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair enough. Good point. For some reason when I was reading that I added the 34 to 84 instead of to 50. I'm gonna chalk that up to being tired."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Misinformed_ideas,2,Mon Mar 23 05:52:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough :) I understand that - okay, we should raise the limit to 80. But he is still going 35 over, and would still be in the wrong."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,11fiffty9,3,Mon Mar 23 05:56:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I see where you're coming from now.

VictoriaBC,2zxybg,elliam,32,Mon Mar 23 05:16:53 2015 UTC,Are you familiar with the area? This is what the highway looks like when it drops from 80km/h to 50km/h - no wonder the average speed was 84km/h - or just 4km/h over the previous speed.  http://i.imgur.com/sjWAMI1.jpg
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,james121345,10,Sun Mar 22 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, you have to pass under a huge sign showing what lane you need to be in for what part of the terminal you're headed to. Big hint that it's close. The 50km/h zone starts 450m from the pull out to go to the walk-on area. You traverse that distance in 32 seconds at the posted speed limit. The gates for vehicles are maybe 700m from the sign. 50 seconds there. How close do you cut things that you can't just do the posted limit?  There's a warning sign about the 50 zone, and by the time the actual 50 zone starts, you can see the foot passenger pull out lane. Natter about cash grabs all you want, but the speed zone is both short and advertised."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,MadePancakesOnce,5,Mon Mar 23 06:22:43 2015 UTC,"That still gives no reasoning to be going 110 or whatever he was clocked at. That is a irresponsible. He wasn't clocked at 80, he was speeding excessively and deserves to pay up for it."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,canadianpastafarian,22,Mon Mar 23 05:18:46 2015 UTC,If only there was some way of warning drivers that the speed limit is dropping. Perhaps a sign of some kind...
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,run31,-7,Sun Mar 22 22:52:34 2015 UTC,Well said.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,mimetic-polyalloy,18,Mon Mar 23 00:32:30 2015 UTC,And then from 50km/h down to 20km/h. It is an unfair place to troll for speeders and certainly shouldn't be making the news.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,RavenOfNod,2,Sun Mar 22 22:29:46 2015 UTC,Except right past those signs is a fucking ferry terminal. The entire reason you need to slow down there
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Brocket-99,2,Mon Mar 23 05:00:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting the picture. I don't think I've ever dropped down to 50 there. Such bullshit.  3 lanes and a pull off lane and you expect me to slow down because there's a gate about a kilometre ahead? Put up a sign explaining why the speed is about to get so low. Unless they have one. It's been a while since I drove on.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,RubiconXJ,8,Mon Mar 23 01:46:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. I went up that route every week for 5.5 years and by the time it turns to 50kph its time to slow down. For the regulars the cops are well known to be waiting there and it's one of the few places where getting drivers to slow down is valuable. I see way too many people blasting through up to the terminal.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,MadePancakesOnce,2,Sun Mar 22 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"What are this sub's thoughts on this:  'Caught at the top speed, Saanich resident Stephen Hodges was rushing to make the 9 a.m. sailing with his 73-year-old mother-in-law, who had an appointment for an arterial scan at Vancouver General Hospital. Hodges was 65 km/h over the limit and the Jaguar he was driving was impounded.  “It was 8:28 and we had to be there for 8:30,” Hodges said. “So yeah, I was speeding.” The officer told him he was going 115 km/h and gave him a ticket for $483.  Hodges said he “pleaded with the officer” to be allowed to drive Carol Ball to Vancouver, but said the sergeant was “totally indifferent.”  Ball had to walk from the kiosk to the terminal alone because her daughter, also in the vehicle, had her ankle in a cast and could not hobble quickly enough to be on time.  “All of which the officer could see. … I thought that officer was callous. He knew we were in distress. He could have let us go onto the ferry.”  '"
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,MadePancakesOnce,44,Sun Mar 22 22:36:55 2015 UTC,Maybe they should leave earlier so that they don't have to rush so much...
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,B1ackmath,33,Sun Mar 22 23:29:27 2015 UTC,I think they shouldn't have done 115 in a 50. That officer probably hears excuses like that on a daily basis.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,the_hardest_part,-9,Sun Mar 22 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"That was a 80 zone 100 meters ago.  Stories like this are commonplace, and yet people wonder why nobody respects or likes police."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,randalgetsdrunk,11,Sun Mar 22 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"shouldn't have done 115 in an 80 zone either. also, the speed limit takes effect when you pass the sign. that's why many limit changes have a warning sign up the road telling you the limit will change soon.  he broke the law and got pissy because he got caught. I feel sorry for his mother-in-law, partly because he made her late, and partly because her son-in-law doesn't give a shit about safety or the law, but I don't feel sorry for him"
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,LlsworthToohey,17,Mon Mar 23 02:51:39 2015 UTC,115 is not 80 and 100 metres back is not where the driver was.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,fotolabman,9,Sun Mar 22 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Regardless of his reasons for speeding, he was hugely per the limit and way past the 80km/hr zone. I can't understand why he is so shocked. If he was doing 60-65 there I'd see his point.   He was so clearly in the wrong here."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Speederino,7,Mon Mar 23 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"How much time does it really save to be doing the extra 50 km/h over a stretch of what, 1 kilometre? For the risk of speeding tickets/dangerous driving, you're not really saving much time."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,KittyMonster,0,Mon Mar 23 05:02:39 2015 UTC,I don't think it's always about being logical. It just sucks to have to go so slow on a 4 lane divided highway.
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,the_hardest_part,18,Mon Mar 23 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's not like the appointment was made last minute  Poor planning on their part isn't the fault of the police  And yes it is arbitrarily lower by 30 km/h in that section that doesn't really make it any safer, but just because you disagree with the posted speed limit doesn't mean you won't suffer the punishment as the law is written"
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Galurana,24,Sun Mar 22 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"This guy is a douche, the only danger his mother-in-law was in was from him doing over twice the speed limit.  Ironically the only reason his mother-in-law even made the ferry was because he got caught, a walk-on can get on at the last minute but if you show up in a car at 8:28 for an 8:30 ferry you will NOT get on.  Holding up everyone on the ferry and the entire sailing schedule because one guy and his in-law can't plan their time effectively, then he has the gall to complain that the officer was 'indifferent' just makes me laugh.."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,KittyMonster,5,Sun Mar 22 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"The ferry leaves at 9am, not 8:30. That route always departs every odd hour (9am, 11am, 1pm, etc). I understand what you're saying but it's not applicable here. He was rushing to make the 8:30 vehicle cut-off."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,Dirkef88,3,Mon Mar 23 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the cutoff for vehicles was something like 5 minutes before the sailing. For foot passengers it's 10 minutes. It seems he probably had a reservation, as I think you need to be there by 30 minutes before the sailing time to be guaranteed boarding."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,samuraipizzacat71,9,Mon Mar 23 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think the reservation cut off is a half hour before so if a person misses it, there's a chance the person will miss the ferry if it's full. IIRC the site's really clear about the cut off and this guy should have left home earlier."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,b10z,2,Mon Mar 23 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right, though I think the ""letting cars on 5 minutes before sailing"" is not a guarantee, even if there's room.   Either way, the ironic thing is that from there he would have made the cut-off no matter what speed he was going."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,b10z,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"Why is this being upvoted? It isn't even true!  From BC Ferries own website: Ticket sales are cut off 10 minutes prior to scheduled sailing time for walk-on passengers, and 5 minutes prior to scheduled sailing time for those driving onto the ferry."
VictoriaBC,2zxybg,freyyr,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:24:54 2015 UTC,When racing for that ferry always check your speed as you come around that last bend - the cops always set up traps there. My roommate was busted last year for going 80 in that 50 zone.

He was a bit if an arrogant shite though (and was pressured by his Dad a lot) and Marty was a whiney cry-baby who both idolized and lived in the shadow of his brother (but was a great soccer player on his own, just not as good as Steven). Of course people change,mand I haven't seen either brother since grade four.  Good for him having such a long and fruitful career though and defying so many odds.

VictoriaBC,2zvfkp,Notnoodles,3,Sun Mar 22 03:38:39 2015 UTC,I think they count the cameras separately from the mounts at intersections. There are quite a few more mounts than cameras.
VictoriaBC,2zvfkp,jjc551,0,Sun Mar 22 04:14:33 2015 UTC,Is it a Provincial or City decision ?
VictoriaBC,2zvfkp,teamleda,4,Sun Mar 22 04:30:18 2015 UTC,They move the cameras around which sit inside the mounts. So often the mounts have no cameras in them.

VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,lagerandlime62,5,Sat Mar 21 06:30:50 2015 UTC,Just like no one is following the new 40km signs around town. I can't see police setting speed traps around these new limit areas.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,hanging_judge,3,Sat Mar 21 13:48:24 2015 UTC,Yes.  Fines.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,Ialmostthewholepost,2,Sat Mar 21 08:57:21 2015 UTC,Yup. Over on the mainland we have a little section of the South Fraser Perimeter Road - a four-lane divided provincial highway - where the limit drops abruptly from 80 to 50 km/h... and they've provided little cut-outs in the shoulder curb just the right size for police cars to park. How convenient.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,emilydm,0,Sat Mar 21 19:02:53 2015 UTC,would be terrible if somebody lost a box of roofing nails off the back of their truck in an area like that.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,Elliot82,4,Sun Mar 22 04:59:31 2015 UTC,I know the one you're talking about - that stretch is absolutely ridiculous. Makes no sense at all.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,chinbeardsareover,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:49:54 2015 UTC,30 is a ridiculous speed to have to drive unless it's a school zone.  There is really no reason to go less than 50 anywhere other than schools.  Victoria is a silly place sometimes
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,who-bah-stank,-5,Mon Mar 23 01:24:10 2015 UTC,And then you have the people who follow the speed limit or do 10 or so under. Or if you get stuck behind an old guy who can't drive and drives stupidly slow with a custom plate SMART. He has also been on Shit Parkers.
VictoriaBC,2zs9nw,teamleda,-1,Sat Mar 21 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"General rule I follow -- if the buses ignore a speed limit, it's safe for you to do so as well.  And Craigflower road is frigging stupid; it's a major thoroughfare and no one obeys that limit. It also has a really weird smattering of signs: 30/40/30/50/40 or some such, so if you do get stopped you can legitimately say you didn't remember which bit you were on / which sign you saw last.  They had one of those ""your speed"" signs at the bottom of the turn after Skinner/Catherine once (in the 30 zone), with a pair of those ""concerned parents""-types in vests that you see near school zones sometimes -- I don't think I saw ever that sign readout dip below 40 :)  And yes, as other posters have said, any 40 speed limit sign that says ""NEW"" beside it is also safe to ignore."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,Herdthegnus,10,Sat Mar 21 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"The reason you got the ticket was because you were breaking the law. The only reason that you would have a ticket dismissed is if you showed that you were not breaking the law. Just because the cops had a speed trap in a spot that has a speed change does not mean that you did not break the law.   They will not dismiss a ticket because the cops were making a ""shitty move"". But if you do decide to fight the ticket on those ground, please let me know, because I'd love to see the look on a judge's face when you say that."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,Stevegap,10,Sat Mar 21 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"""I was going 96 in an 80 zone"" - coming from someone who enjoys going fast you need to take some accountability here and accept that you got busted. the police are always sitting at the bottom of the overpass catching people, it's not a smart place to be speeding and for good reason. i know people who work at the terminal and have almost been killed by morons flying to the gate because they are late."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,nrtphotos,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:43:57 2015 UTC,I'll take my lumps but if they were serious about safety then they should reduce the speed limit further out and add some speed bumps. As it is the police seem content to give out 109 tickets in a day. Thanks u/mcnab for the reference.
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,Sasken,7,Sun Mar 22 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"Everybody speeds there.  BUT, you were 16 over the limit. You have no case. All they have to hear is ""I was speeding"" and the case is closed."

VictoriaBC,2zujjh,mimetic-polyalloy,-1,Sat Mar 21 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Did you even read what I wrote? I accept full responsibility for my actions. What I'm questioning is the validity of the speed trap. It's clearly there to make $$, not to maintain some form of order or safety. Isn't that the point of speed traps? On top of this, I feel they are preying on out of towners who are unfamiliar with the area and would be less likely to dispute a ticket from out of town."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,mimetic-polyalloy,3,Sun Mar 22 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"your basis for fighting the ticket, for the offense which you admit to being guilty of, amounts to ""thats unfair"". like i said: get real"
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,mimetic-polyalloy,0,Sun Mar 22 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Ok let's go beyond me as an individual fighting this ticket. Why as a society are we allowing the police force to tax is in this manner? If there are better ways to make the ferry approach safer, should we not use them? I don't particularly care about my ticket so much as I care that this is a common practice (speed trap) and we should not tolerate it as it serves no purpose other than to line the police coffers."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,nrtphotos,5,Sun Mar 22 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Look, it's extremely simple. Obey the law or face the penalty. This is not some great miscarriage of justice. A way to makethe ferry approach safer is to slow down like signs say to do. I have no idea why you think that any this any thing but your own fault .If you were doing what you were supposed to be doing, you wouldn't have a problem. You can call it a trap like it's some great deception but the reality is that is just enforcement of the law in a place the police know that people are breaking it.. You can also call it a tax if you want but it is nothing but a tax on stupid."

VictoriaBC,2zujjh,nrtphotos,2,Sun Mar 22 06:31:14 2015 UTC,"there is nothing to dispute, you said it yourself you were speeding what do you not understand about this?"
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,FredThe12th,0,Sun Mar 22 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"Ok one last time. The speed limit is reduced rather suddenly at the exact same time as you are reading signs for which exit or which lane to be in. The speed trap is on a straight stretch with plenty of visibility. My whole point is that there isn't a need for a trap in this location. I am not arguing my speed. I am stating that there is a source a revenue that the police are using while serving no real use to the public. If safety were truly a concern here, the fees from 109 tickets that day could surely pay for signage and speedbumps to calm traffic. I doubt very seriously that safety is the prime reasoning for the speed trap. /endrant"
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,nrtphotos,2,Sun Mar 22 03:58:13 2015 UTC,"Seems like a lot of people are missing the point. You are guilty of speeding and you accept that, but you disagree with the law that you broke.  I would say fighting the ticket would be a good step. You could also consider one of those online petition things (not sure how much weight those things carry, though). Maybe door to door collection signatures of people who agree with you about the speed limit on that section of road. You could start sending some letters to your MP and the Mayor of that areas as well. Maybe the best first step is to do a simple Google search for ""Canada change a law"" and see what comes up.  Good luck to you. It's nice to see people take advantage of the processes we have in place to enact change when they disagree with something."
VictoriaBC,2zujjh,FredThe12th,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you for actually reading everything I wrote. I won't be fighting the ticket but I did want to have a conversation about how to stop this sort of thing, or at least what the process might entail.

VictoriaBC,2zujjh,thelawnranger,3,Mon Mar 23 02:24:36 2015 UTC,Looks like you and 108 others that day.  http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/police-nab-109-speeders-en-route-to-ferry-1.1800268  Not sure how much you can do.  Locals know that spot has been their gravy spot for years.  Personally I think if they were so concerned about slowing traffic down there they would build some speed bumps and put tons of signage up warning of them.  Having the 50k zone so far back seems a bit ridiculous.   As far as fighting it your best bet is to pebbly jusy hope the cop doesn't show.  You would have to grt a lawyer involved  to figure out some other way to fight it.

VictoriaBC,2zqo5w,mollycoddles,3,Fri Mar 20 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"You might enjoy taking some pictures of the Johnson street bridge, affectionately known as the ""blue bridge"".  Right downtown, being twinned right now.  You can get some cool shots of it.   Also right up the road from there is a shipyard that is right on the road.  Some big boats out of water only a few feet away for picture taking.   On the downtown side of the bridge is the older part of Victoria, lots of heritage buildings.  Market square is neat.  Check out fan tan alley and China town as well.   All that stuff is within a few hundred meters of each other, including spinnakers mentioned in here, as well as canoe club (harbourside beers, live band Friday, Saturday nights), the drake, swans.  Lots to see!  Have fun!"
VictoriaBC,2zqo5w,Fe02c,3,Sat Mar 21 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"Pubs/restaurants that aren't the top yelp results (I'm on mobile, you can google their websites :)):   Cenote: underground (literally) wine bar with live music. It's downtown The Tartan Toque: ""hipster"" casual pub with excellent burgers and wings, also has tons of board games placed throughout the booths. It's a few minutes up the road from downtown, in Fernwood The Guild: Maritime themed waterfront pub. Delicious deep fried scotch eggs and a great atmosphere. Right downtown!    Sorry, I can't tell you much about any events this weekend except for a cultural show at Alix Golden hall tonight at 7, entry by donation. It's downtown as well. Hope you have a great weekend!"
VictoriaBC,2zqo5w,aheadbyacentury,7,Fri Mar 20 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"Is the Tartan Toque considered 'hipster'? It's not pretentious at all IMO. Good house-made sauces, delicious food, laid-back with a couple of beer taps, a cider tap (not a pub). Oak Bay Junction.  Great staff. Not hipster."

Doug is a little more scenic and less of the city, Mt. Finlayson if you want more of a challenge and its out of town. Sooke Potholes and Thetis Lake. Drive/walk along Dallas Road and check out Ogden Point - it has a nice look out there...  Pub: The Guild and Little Jumbo are for good cocktails.  Bfast: Jam - they have a nice spin on breakfast foods, Blue Fox  Cafe, John's Place, and Sunshine Cafe.  People Watching: Habit Coffee and the Star Bucks inside chapters downtown (you cant miss it).  Good Eats: Red Fish Blue Fish (are they open now?), Sushi Plus (Good Luck), Spinnakers Pub makes their own truffle chocolate I believe."

VictoriaBC,2zp8s0,DonnyDumphy,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"Witnesses told police that Lesage had been drinking with a friend that afternoon on the Galloping Goose Regional Trail. Thorne, who was with a 17-year-old girl and another man, heard Lesage had money and they decided to rob him, Salmond said.  The Crown believes the man who was with Thorne stabbed Lesage, Salmond said. The blade of the knife went into Lesage’s brain. He was permanently disabled and will require treatment for a long time.  “There’s no evidence to link the two females to the stabbing, other than that they were present for the incident. There’s no information that they understood it was going to happen and encouraged it,” Salmond said.  Another youth told police she saw Thorne and the 17-year-old go through Lesage’s backpack and take items out of his pack."

VictoriaBC,2zpjc4,FredThe12th,3,Fri Mar 20 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"Education major here over at UVic - This isn't completely true. While English-only teachers will likely have to spend 7 years on a TOC list before getting a permanent position, french-immersion teachers are MUCH MORE in demand and from what practicum teachers have told me and the other three people in my program that are interested in french immersion is that french immersion teachers often get jobs fairly soon after graduation."
VictoriaBC,2zpjc4,onetwosleep,3,Sat Mar 21 06:11:41 2015 UTC,"My wife is a teacher in SD63. Anyone with  a specialty has a better chance of finding full time teaching work. Everyone teaches Math, English Science etc... Not everyone can teach Drama, foods, French."
VictoriaBC,2zpjc4,moral_mercenary,2,Sat Mar 21 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ok. Thank you FredThe12th. According to what we can read on the web site "" Make a future - careers in BC education"" we thought the chance of having a full-time job was good.  ""With the largest French immersion program per student enrollment in the province, there are many teaching opportunities in Victoria.  The Greater Victoria School District #61, is currently hiring French Immersion teachers at all levels for all subjects for full-time, part-time and on-call positions."""
VictoriaBC,2zpjc4,FredThe12th,3,Fri Mar 20 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"What happens from my understanding is part time teachers get the full time positions,  on call people get part time  and finally people lacking seniority in the district get on the on-call list.  This is a much better situation than many others who wait years to make it to the on-call list, and then barely work at all."

Employees at tillicum have no clue, but they think early may, though they may get folded into hillside at some point.  Employees at hillside have been told mid may.  This store keeps receiving stock from up island and Alberta as most Alberta stores are already out of their buildings.  And are expecting to have tillicum stock brought over in April."
VictoriaBC,2zmq39,Tigrin,2,Sat Mar 21 04:12:56 2015 UTC,No store on the island is still getting replenished from off the island. Hillside is receiving Campbell River's stock and probably Courtenay' soon. The island was cut off from replenishment due to barge costs quite a few weeks ago.
VictoriaBC,2zmq39,ScubaJes,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:03:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the additional info.  I only knew what the employees had told me.  And it seemed strange for them to ship stuff from so far away since their profit on it would then be so low.
VictoriaBC,2zmq39,Tigrin,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:03:33 2015 UTC,Hillside has only received more stock from Campbell River. They stopped receiving trucks from Alberta at the end of February.
VictoriaBC,2zmq39,alittlederp,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:54:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. So whichever is last will probably have all the stock consolidated from the others.
VictoriaBC,2zmq39,ScubaJes,0,Fri Mar 20 18:13:26 2015 UTC,"This. Hillside will probably be the last store standing with all other island stores sending their stock to them. At some point, it will not be cost effective to pay the team members with the amount of stock left in the store so they will close to the public and pack that remaining stock up. It's also how Zellers worked when they closed."

The trouble with Victoria is so many of the Vets work for Shaw and even if the Vets are good, the company they work for nickels and dimes you. I've also found them to be very manipulative and will take serious advantage of you if you have a pet with a chronic condition."
VictoriaBC,2zm8cz,rednightmare,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:03:36 2015 UTC,We have a vehicle so I think our kitty would be alright going over there.

VictoriaBC,2zm8cz,knottysleeves,3,Fri Mar 20 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Check ""vet"" in the search bar, there are lots of previous posts with recommendations.  Also, +1 for avoiding Shaw. My first cat had to be put down a couple weeks after they did a radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroid. The treatment went fine, but she must have gotten shoddy care during the isolation week at the clinic, because she developed a horrible UTI that they didn't even notice (and she'd never had a urinary issue in her entire life). By the time I got her back home and settled and was able to recognize that her litterbox behaviours weren't normal, it was too late, the blockage was so bad that there wasn't anything my vet could do. Shaw refused to accept any responsibility for their shitty post-op care and monitoring. Unfortunately, Shaw is the only vet service on the entire island that offers radioiodine treatment... and my other cat is now hyperthyroid as well. :-("
VictoriaBC,2zm8cz,viress,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:25:56 2015 UTC,I'm sorry that happened to your cat :(  If you need to take your cat to them again give them hell and remind them of what happened to your other cat.

My dog had been suffering from some gastrointestinal problems since he was a puppy and none of the other vets I took him to did much about it.  Patrick got him on a new diet and some medication and he's much better.
VictoriaBC,2zm8cz,lyssavirus,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"That's good to know!  Our cat is a barfer, he throws up and we've tried different foods like the vets told us to but still doesn't seem to make much difference.  Although, I do discourage him from going all bonkers immediately after eating, that could make anyone barf."
VictoriaBC,2zm8cz,jimmyvic,2,Thu Mar 19 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"Check and see if the chemical Ethoxyquin is on the ingredients list. Its very common in pet food and sure had the upchuck effect on my cat. If the first couple of ingredients of his food are grains instead of meats that can also be a problem. Iams chicken flavor in the orange bag is what our cat demands now with varied fancy feast flavors on the side. He's fat now, but at least he stopped throwing up!  If its not an allergy and the cat just has a weak stomach (lots of people and cats do) you could also bring in some grass from the lawn, they like chewing on it and find it soothing. It won't stop the barfing, quite the opposite in fact! At least hes just taking in grass and bringing it up again along with excess acids or whatever is upsetting him, making it more likely to hold onto his food.   Keep in mind that what is showing as a food problem could actually be water related. I lived in Saanich and for 5 years my cat drank from a dripping tub faucet with no issues, now I've moved to James Bay and the pipes that bring the water are 75 years older. The cat will not drink the water in this part of town and was headed for some trouble until I picked up a pet fountain and filtered water.   Judging by the discoloration of my new coffee pot from just a few weeks using this water, I think the cat was really making a good point, yours may be too."

It went up to %15 percent flat tax. I think. This all happened with the HST tax changes.

The document I linked to is the actual Accommodation PST Act Bulletin published by our very own government of BC for the year 2015. I think you are missing the point and the break down of the taxes applied to a room. The conversation is referring to only the PST applied to the room as (in BC) the PST is higher for accommodation than it is for good & services which might give the impression that a hotel is 'ripping someone off' by charging extra tax. It is not a 'Flat Tax' applied to each room, rather the break down looks like :  PST    8% MRDT 2% GST    5%  total   15%  The 2% you are thinking of is called a municipal regional district tax. The bottom of page 4 shows a typical example for our very own city of Victoria. 10% = PST +MRDT  Also, why bring up the HST, we are not talking about the year 2013 are we?  Source: I can read."

Reservations only. That way we know how much staff for the ship.any last minute travelers pay more 2. Fire some of the very top heavy management team. 3. Get more money from the feds even if we have to go to court to get it
VictoriaBC,2zhihf,Mizuno04,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"Not really sure how a reservation only system will actually help reduce labor costs.  The only way to effectively schedule the minimum required staff as per transport Canada regulations would be to have advance notice of the reservations.  Not everyone plans a trip to or from the Mainland a week in advance.  So you would still be, in affect, raising fairs, because most people would fall under the last minute traveler category.  Either way you would still require staff to be on standby, to meet the legal quotas, if your walk on passengers exceeded the number of staff you had scheduled, based on the reservations only.    What are you basing your ""top heavy"" management numbers from?  The latest report from the Commissioner claims that BC Ferries has actually reduced the amount of over time, and Executive compensation.  Course it could all bullshit, I am actually genuinely interested in your source.     I agree with you about the Feds.  They need to start cracking open their wallets a little more, but good luck with that.  Its probably easier getting blood from a rock."

VictoriaBC,2zhihf,ATGGTCGATAATGAATCTTC,4,Wed Mar 18 18:59:44 2015 UTC,Schedules are based both on demand and what communities have said they need after extensive consultations. The ridiculous four hour gaps in the middle of the day on some routes is because local residents made it very clear that early morning and late evening sailings were more important to keep. They can't all be kept as there is often so little demand that it makes no financial sense to run a ferry with 5 cars on it because it is more convenient for those 5 passengers.

VictoriaBC,2zhihf,Dirkef88,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:25:28 2015 UTC,but the horseshoe bay route would be pointless with a bridge. depending on where it was placed you could still drive via bridge quicker than ferry.

I've seen a lot of people homeless in BC, simply because their parents kicked them out the day they turned 18 - but most of them it's due to the fact that they have ripped off, cheated, or screwed over in some way, every person who would normally have their back with a place to stay."
VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,james121345,9,Thu Mar 19 08:49:19 2015 UTC,"But thats not the point i am making. Its that OP and babybats is simply calling anyone who is homeless or using not decent human beings and think they are better then them. Many of our homeless are veterans, disabled, hard working joe who got laid off. While I worked as a manager last year at McDonald's I met a very humble homeless man. He wouldn't even accept a coffee on the house. He wasn't some cracked our weirdo. He was the average joe who ended up having really bad luck and couldnt work. You can not just say lets throw them all in jail, because alot of them if given the social programs would be given another chance that they would not have otherwise. Jail keeps them off the street temporarily and does not help anyone, and harms taxpayers more than OP thinks. Those wasted hours cops spend overpatrolling downtown could be used to help fix the problem. This 5 minute video showcases a team in houston TX who care. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWdlDABmvo&ab_channel=NationSwell We need people to care about the homeless because even if 90% of them are people who deserve jack shit ((which is completely ballparking it)) the other 10% still do deserve it! Why throw 100 people in jail when you could potentially save 10 peoples lives?"
VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,ILoveBabyBats,4,Thu Mar 19 09:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's not the disabled and the veterans we're talking about here... it's the crazy strung out people that make most people really uncomfortable around Douglas street. I can't wait for the 15x or 28 bus without some crazy person screaming and threatening either me or some other poor sap who doesn't want to give them what they want.  I've seen so many drug deals go down outside Mac's, inside Burger King, in and around the Second Slice. I love how beautiful our city is... but damn it can get really fricken seedy.

VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,james121345,4,Fri Mar 20 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Even so policing them out of one area and into another is no solution. That is not fixing the problem, its making it worse. And lumping all the homeless on douglas into one group of ""low-lifes"" doesn't help either."
VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,Notnoodles,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:58:21 2015 UTC,I honestly feel like the solution is raising minimum wage a decent amount; make it easier to earn a living.
VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,james121345,1 point,Fri Mar 20 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"I would love an increase to minimum. But an effect of that is the places who pay minimum usually end up just cutting hours and employees. ""I'm looking at you fast-food."" - Yes you increase the amount of money a given person is being given, but because some CEO of a grocery store now has to pay extra for their employees, and they want to maximize their cut of the revenue they will do whatever they can. It may not be a significant amount, but now someone who is being payed x amount more per hour has to pay some number more for food.   But I could be completely wrong, im not an economist. I don't know what the outcome has been for any place that has raised minimum wage to above a ""living"" wage."

And as someone who's been down and out, I know exactly who on Victoria's Streets is still down and out after years of people trying to help them out, and these people do exactly like Brocket says.  They try to cheat the system, or cheat the people trying to help them, and I personally view it as laziness.  You CAN get help and get back to work if you want to, a lot of people just choose not to.  No a serious disability is another thing, but i'm more referring to the people that choose to hang out on the streets and get high.  My partner worked at a liquor store downtown, you can bet he never hands out spare change…. because he knows almost every single homeless person by name as a regular at the liquor store."

VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,Brocket-99,0,Sat Mar 21 07:48:53 2015 UTC,"But from their perspective, they see cities like New Orleans, where they go on vacation, and aren't asked for spare change once while in the tourist areas.  And then come back here and it's every 10 seconds in our the tourist area.  I agree with everything you are saying, but there's also this.  We don't want people thrown in jail, but it gets ridiculous when homeless people take over your downtown so that no one else can use it. We should all be able to co-exist - but it seems like tourism has made that take a backseat."

Nobody here has condemned homelessness, nor even addiction, it is the public use and everything that comes along with it - ie tagging, public urination, littering, intimidation of residents and shoppers, fighting, broken glass, begging, taking up the entire sidewalk and refusing to move ( outside by chapters and mcdonalds on douglas ) breaking into cars etc etc etc."

And he's right. I would add Aboriginal Canadians, single parent family units, people with disabilities, and seniors to populations more likely to be in poverty.  Have you heard of the poverty cycle? I'd recommend you looking into that, because I think this is an issue that everyone should be more educated on. On the other hand, I've looked through some of your comment history and I think you are clearly biased against homeless people, people with addictions, and people with disabilities.

Thanks for the intelligent reply, but I find it hilarious that you equate not wanting crackheads infesting my town with me being anti-lower class and racist. I'm guessing you aren't from here.  Furthermore, I find your insinuation that there is a direct correlation between being 'poor' and being a drug addict to be objectively wrong and also morally irresponsible.

VictoriaBC,2zjmaa,marlowrt,6,Thu Mar 19 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"It is extremely important to include poverty, class and racism when talking about addiction. A majority of ""crackheads"" suffer both lower-class circumstances and racism or abuse. You cannot know what has caused someone's life to get to that point. If you have a problem with homeless people in Victoria I suggest you move elsewhere.

Because you have an ""in"" to the schools with French, you'll probably get to teach some English, but otherwise we're overflowing with them. There's also some weird rules with ported your seniority over to the district (assuming you have some).  Tourism industry is vague. What specifically are you looking at? Victoria has a very large tourism industry, so jobs are dependant on specifically what you do.  We're overflowing with wedding photographers, don't get your hopes up there for steady work there, even with a good portfolio.

No longer counts as a suite by the city.

VictoriaBC,2zdowl,AppleJuice12,2,Wed Mar 18 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"I know you already called a place, but if you should need a different place, I recommend International Womens Catering Co-op.  I go to farmers markets all summer/fall just to buy their samosas. Seriously the BEST I've had."

VictoriaBC,2zdowl,Elliot82,0,Tue Mar 17 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"lol I'm heating a few up from Thrifty's right now. 99 cents a piece. Vegetable is a little bland with just a little spice but pretty good. Chicken has lots of spice, tastes a lot like the vegetable. Beef doesn't have much spice but has lots of flavor. Now that I think about it they should be baked before serving, so maybe for 300 you should go with a caterer."
VictoriaBC,2zdowl,jimmyvic,5,Tue Mar 17 20:37:41 2015 UTC,No way.  I baked them 15 at a time for like 5-6 minutes on 400.  You should hire me and provide me an oven.  You arrange to pick up 200 from Thrifty foods.  I'll bake as many as I can fit in your provided oven at once for $50/h minimum charge 2 hours.    Looking at $300 for 200 tasty samosas!   I'd like to see a caterer beat that.

Panorama is like 25 min. from downtown Victoria, it's a nice facility, and the area is relatively affluent.  I get that the arena could use some new dressing rooms, but lets compare to the other BC town in this competition, Dawson Creek:  Their entire arena is currently closed due to ammonia contamination ...

At any given time you can see 4 or 5 little signs with various instructions; Don't rest sitting on the machines, clean up after yourself, don't drop weights, Wipe the counter, Don't do x here, No cell phone use, 25 min cardio machine maximum, Hang this up, wipe this down, exit this door. Basic Gym etiquette, I have a regional pass so I go to all the rec centers and Oak Bay has more signs than any other gym. They'd do better off hanging one sign that said ""Don't be a dick"".

VictoriaBC,2zf490,skeletonwar,4,Fri Mar 20 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"Obviously they have to put up these signs because people don't know ""basic gym etiquette"" and they need to be said. Not everyone is familiar with the gym rules such as wiping machines down or don't know how to use equipment properly (OB Rec gets a lot of highschoolers, uni students, and old people)  Unfortunately people still don't listen to them. I go to Oak Bay Rec and there's always old dudes & gym bros that sit on the equipment to watch hockey and it's fucking annoying. And soccer moms who don't sign up for equipment or move when your time starts.

VictoriaBC,2z7psv,Hoblok,2,Mon Mar 16 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"The only leverage the mounties have to get information is appeals to justice and threats of prosecution. A potential informant's fear of reprisals and ostracism will probably outweigh their desire for justice, especially given how alienated from the system they are, not to mention their concern over being caught up in the investigation and suspected of the crime themselves. Add to that the fact that if no one informs in the first place then no one will be prosecuted, so threats might not amount to much. Hopefully the cops get a break somehow, but I doubt anyone who knows anything will have much to say. If this is gang-related then lips will be that much tighter."

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,Brocket-99,5,Sun Mar 15 20:25:14 2015 UTC,I do this at Thetis lake. Parking ticket is good all day but you only spent a couple hours there. Sometimes you can cycle a ticket all day and make it last.
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,Winnie_Cat,2,Sun Mar 15 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Thetis is the best example I have. I always hand the slip to the person walking up to the machine if possible.  Or leave it on top, but I'm sure they get removed often."

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,StackLeeAdams,19,Tue Mar 17 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"They actually have a Downtown Victoria Parking App for iphones and androids. It tells you how much time you have left, and you can end it any time you want and they'll refund your money! You can also conveniently extend your time through the app. I've been using it since it came out and love it so much. I don't need to spend that extra 25 mins walking around because ""I still have time on my parking meter"". Last weekend, we parked near a brunch place we were going to, found out that it would be a 45-minute wait, so we decided to drive somewhere else to eat. I cancelled my parking and was charged just for the 5 minutes that we were parked.  If you pay by credit card, there's a transaction fee, but if you buy money to load your ""wallet"" (like $10), there's no fee."
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,scarletsally,2,Sun Mar 15 04:27:59 2015 UTC,thanks...unfortunately I have to park downtown quite a bit (kids activities) and have been using the parking cards for awhile.

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,Biff_Tannen___,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"Of course. But most people I know would rather wait til their time is up on the meter if they have nothing too important to get to. You do know the meter doesn't refund you your money if you leave early, right?"

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,scarletsally,-1,Sun Mar 15 20:04:48 2015 UTC,"This is the classic sunk cost error.  The money is already gone so really it shouldn't factor into you decision.   It's the same idea of walking out of a bad movie that you paid for. You already paid, let's say you can't get a refund, should you leave? Or, because you paid, should you suffer through the movie even though you are not having fun?  Or putting down a terrible book that you bought? You already paid for it but it's a terrible book- keep reading it or stop?   The rational thing to do is realize that the money is gone and the only decision left to make is stay or go?"
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,kuiper0x2,11,Sun Mar 15 20:13:13 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how much Victoria makes off overlapping parking payments. I wish those machines would let you know how much time they have left but that would benefit the consumer so fuck me right?
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,cerebraldictator,8,Sun Mar 15 23:26:17 2015 UTC,A significant amount. The design isn't by accident.   The only way around it is to go to city hall and get a parking card. That allows you recharge the amount you overpaid before leaving.  Unfortunately the app doesn't do that.
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,actuallychrisgillen,11,Sun Mar 15 02:50:09 2015 UTC,"Q. I still have an hour left on my parking time. Does this mean I'm losing $3?  A. The ParkVictoria app and mobile web application allow you to stop your parking session and only pay for the time you have used --  essentially refunding any unused time. To stop a parking session, open ParkVictoria. On the ""Parking Session"" screen, select the ""Session Options"" tab at the bottom of the screen. Then select the ""Stop Parking"" option. You have stopped your parking session.  From the ParkVictoria App FAQ - http://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/departments/engineering/parking/parkvictoria-mobile-payment/frequently-asked-questions.html"

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,lyssavirus,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:38:11 2015 UTC,its a big flaw that can be used for evil. For example out of town tourist loads up spot with maximum parking time. Tolldude comes along shortly after and puts $0.25 in the meter for that spot. Meter gets reset to very small amount of time. Meter reader scumbag comes along and tickets tourist for expired parking even though they should still have time on the clock.
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,ATGGTCGATAATGAATCTTC,4,Sun Mar 15 16:12:42 2015 UTC,VGH is great for that. If I have some time left I will drive by the machines and if nobody there will leave my ticket sticking out of the ticket printing receptical.
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,notonthisbus,6,Wed Mar 18 19:09:17 2015 UTC,Brilliant! I almost always overpay when I park at street parking (the disproportionate anxiety caused by the unlikely scenario of running out of time is much worse for me than being out a bit of extra pocket change). I'll start carrying tape as well.
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,Subculture1000,6,Sun Mar 15 02:14:14 2015 UTC,I just use the parking app so I can get my money back if I don't use all the time.

VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,czarl13,2,Sun Mar 15 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"one thing I never understood about the parking and ""extending your time""....when you are using the parking card, don't they charge you the full amount automatically, therefore ""topping it up"" is not an option?  is the top up just for people that pay a loonie at a time and then realize they are running late?"
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,wrgrant,2,Sun Mar 15 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"The big thing that has seemingly gone unnoticed by most people is that when they introduced this parking system and removed the meters, the price doubled. You used to get twice the amount of time for the same money if I recall correctly.   I imagine they make a tidy sum off of people paying for the same time due to overlap as well."
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,Shawn68z,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"The price changes had nothing to do with the new meters system.  They did a parking review in late 2013, which if you remember was $2.25/hr for all parking. From the review they changed the prices of the meters to how desirable that parking spot is. Ranges from $1.25 to $3.00/hr.    The amount of time a car can be parked also changed based on the location.    http://www.victoria.ca/assets/Departments/Engineering~Public~Works/Images/Parking%20Map%20and%20Legend.pdf"

Sorry to be that jerk :("
VictoriaBC,2z2ux5,ThreeEasyPayments,6,Mon Mar 16 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"It does help if you're going to be less than that amount of time so you don't have to pay.

VictoriaBC,2z4m04,Honeykill,6,Sun Mar 15 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"When my grandpa couldn't really walk anymore, he always wanted to go to nature. There's more than a few wheelchair friendly parks around town. Here's a few ideas:  Go for a drive around the woods at Royal Roads University. It's beautiful and serene there.  After the drive, you could park down by the water. There's free parking by the boathouse, and I haven't ever gotten in trouble for going down there on a Saturday or Sunday. You could have a little picnic or something. It's a stunning view. Ocean on one side, the castle on the other, flanked by thick forest. You'll likely see swans and all other kinds of beautiful birds, since the water around there is a protected nature sanctuary.  Saxe Point Park and Macauley Point are both in Esquimalt. Both have stunning views of the harbour and Port Angeles.  Saxe Point has a ton of picnic benches and a large, open, relatively flat field. Great for picnics and sun soaking.  Macauley Point has a ton of long, winding, cement paths. You could easily tour your grandma around in a wheelchair. It's an old military base, so there are some really interesting structures around this area.  Finally, I'll suggest Sidney. It's quite a drive from Bear Mountain, but the entire town seems set up for Elderly folk. Benches be everywhere. There's cute cafes, nice restaurants and bakeries, tons of shopping, and an incredible, huge waterfront.  I hope you have fun on your vacation! Thanks for caring about your grandma's needs. :)  Edit: If you go see the swans, do not approach them. They're pretty, but MEAN.  Also, Royal Roads has peacocks! TONS of them!"

VictoriaBC,2z2490,The_Younger_Arouet,6,Sun Mar 15 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"Cheers! It is important that we remain in a culture of mutual respect. As you indeed you know very well, it also is important for there to be a certain degree of solidarity between the community and the Police.  Too often there is divisive actions and words taken by both the people and the police, and that simple fact often does too much to undermine the peaceful and righteous causes that we as a majority stand for.  Just as you are watching us and watching over us.. The people are watching the watchmen too. ;)"

If the people are watching, how come the police keeps telling us bullshit in the press releases.  The RCMP still stick to their theory that the attack on the Songhees Reserve wasn't premeditated."
VictoriaBC,2z2490,The_Younger_Arouet,2,Tue Mar 17 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Any time that there is bullshit in police press releases, that can partially be because we as a collective do not seize stronger oversight and challenge the official story with vigorous conviction. Also, there are still willfully ignorant people who believe all they are told, without a question, and that is shameful in its own right. Certainly however, there are times where people target police with fallacious and accusatory remarks. So that is something we have to be careful of. Because it does do dissent a disservice at times, and it is divisive. But of course it is hard to know what to believe or say when oversight is inadequate and the media(s) can be so easily manipulated from all sides of the argument.  As for what you say about the RCMP and the Songhees, well, I myself am unqualified to speak of that because I have read so little about it but I will have to look into it via multiple different sources when I can."

VictoriaBC,2z2490,The_Younger_Arouet,9,Sun Mar 15 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"Bill C-51 is a controversial and perceivably illegal, and highly unconstitutional,  omni-bus bill which is filled with ambiguities, vagueness, and broadened and dangerous capabilities. This bill was drafted in secret and rushed into the light of day at the last minute, because they knew that we would not like it if we knew the ramifications, and they knew we would so fervently oppose it, and they wanted to stifle the debate.   Many critics are overwhelmingly concerned that such a bill would be utilized to target political opponents of the government (such as protesters, conscientious objectors, activists, dissenting parties, influential individuals, and identifiable groups) and turn them into enemies of the state.  They are right to have such concerns. Other concerns include terrifying and gross infringements upon our collective Chartered Rights and Freedoms, and our privacies, stifling activism, dissent, assembly, protest, expression. Etc.  There are so called provisions in the bill which are supposed to protect activists, lawful dissent, protest, etc, however, this can largely be perceived as a lie because peaceful activists and groups are already spied on and harassed by the RCMP and presumably other agencies within Canada, maybe even in the FVEY.  Such people and groups who have already been spied on and harassed include Cindy Blackstock, The Dogwood Initiative and its members, Idle No More, and undoubtedly any group or individual who has a 'radical' or influential ideology regarding anything of any significance.   People in opposition of this bill include MPs in every political party, multiple former and presumably some current Canadian Supreme Court justices, multiple former Prime-Ministers, hundreds (probably thousands at this point) of scholars, professors, and legal experts, and many thousands of citizens who have been paying attention to what has been happening in our country and abroad.   Some say it is similar to the USA's rather nasty Patriot Act.   It is an enabler of a seemingly imminent witch-hunt. It is an attempt to retro-actively sanction the overwhelmingly perturbing capabilities that already exist within the Prism/Five Eyes surveillance/spying/psychological warfare program."

VictoriaBC,2z5zyg,z781,3,Sun Mar 15 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"Hi, we'd like to point out that the information in the TripAdvisor review is inaccurate. There's no legislation stating there's free camping at Beacon Hill Park.   The bylaw the review refers to is one that allows homeless persons to set up a temporary overhead shelter between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. when Daylight Savings Time is in effect, and 7:00 p.m. and 7 a.m. when it is not.  They are not permitted at any time in a playgrounds, sports fields, footpaths, roads within the park, environmentally sensitive areas, or any area within the park that has been designated for an event or activity by permit.  For more information, click here.  If you are concerned about an activity in the park, please contact City of Victoria Parks Office at 250.361.0600 or the City of Victoria Bylaw Office at 250.361.0215 or bylawenforcement@victoria.ca"

My issue is with the litter, garbage, used condomes, broken bottles, blankets, clothing, cardboard and newspaper tarps and needles left behind by SOME of the "" campers "". Notice I use the term ""campers"" loosely, because Ive camped my entire life and the prerogative has always been take out more than you bring in, and leave a small footprint. Also, I have been told that the bathrooms are not 24 hours ( has this changed  ? ), and city staff have refused to cleanup these ""camp sites "" as they are rife with human waste. Lets add to the fact that the law is the ""campsites"" must be taken down at 7am, so go for a walk in the park any morning around 10 am and you will see more of our taxpayer money being wasted by two police officers having to traverse the entire park rousting the ""campers"" , truly a wonderful and enlightening thing for my 2.5 year old to witness. So in summation, city of victoria, get your shit together, if this is the law, then deal with it appropriately, get these areas cleaned daily, get some bathrooms, start applying fines to those not out by 7 and those littering in our wonderful park."

It's far easier to devote their time to BS fun-time projects like speed limits and roadway gardens.

Also given how much of the municipal time and energy is spent examining the homeless issue and implementing solutions I hardly think it can be argued that they're ignoring it."
VictoriaBC,2z5zyg,actuallychrisgillen,0,Mon Mar 16 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with your expectation of government to be capable of handling a mixture of serious projects and ""face-time"" pursuits. It is politics, after all.  I don't agree that this is a completely false equivalency, in that this city council has proven itself unanimously willing and capable of finding and devoting funding to projects which have questionable public support. Dealing with homelessness and the degradation of our public parks is a contentious issue, but rather than making bold strokes and actually accomplishing anything of note, the council mires itself in endless debate. But perhaps you could show me some of the solutions being implemented?   Spending money to establish 24-hour accessible washroom facilities, or some other appreciable effort, would be a strong move, would alienate and anger some voters, and would actually accomplish something. But this is not done. Spending money on speed limits and other trivial projects had much the same effect, and somehow council managed to get it done.  I would enjoy someone on council actually making effort to affect serious change, rather than worrying more about reelection. But perhaps I've been watching too much House of Cards."
VictoriaBC,2z5zyg,FightingFugu,6,Mon Mar 16 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"Umm how about http://victoriahomelessness.ca/ ?  A large scale multi-governmental project funded through the CRD and private partnerships that covers literally everything to do with homelessness from housing to medical to retraining and has the mandate to end homelessness by 2018. Seriously, pitch in they do amazing work.  The reason that homelessness isn't 'dealt with' is that this is the single hardest issue in municipal politics and requires massive investment and buy in from every service in the city.  With the Coalition they're pretty much there and whatever your feeling on Mayor Helps politics I've seen no evidence that homelessness isn't a major issue to her or this council.  Plus this is municipal politics. Want to be on council? Put your name forward, you have a better than even chance of winning and then you too can revel in the wonders of city politics for less than 40k a year."

Do this for long enough, and I freaking GUA-RAN-TEE, you will see litter decline.

VictoriaBC,2yz2do,Brocket-99,2,Sat Mar 14 10:16:34 2015 UTC,"Here's four reasons:  One: I've known 3 people to work for him. One was several years ago. He owned a restaurant that he knew was going under, and sold it for the new year on October 1st.  He didn't tell any of his employees that it was being sold.  Cook went in to do his New Years Day Brunch shift and found the locks had been changed, and he was out of a job.  Two: I know someone who worked for him a few months ago. She is an amazing fine dining server.  She arranged a meeting with the owner and the manager to discuss how service could be improved, and they fired her on the spot.  The manager ended the meeting with 'I never liked your ugly face anyways.'  Three: Neighbour worked for him. Past his 3 month probationary period.  Slowly taken off the schedule with the sole explanation of 'we just don't have any shifts for you right now'.  Four: The only restaurant open on that side of street is 10 acres pub as the other two are in renovations.  Yet I know people working in the restaurant across the street that have told me the Sysco truck pulls up and makes deliveries daily.  Sysco definitely does not get it's supplies from a 10 acre farm.

If you have the opportunity to sit at the bar and drink her creations, do so.  However, in my opinion it's not worth it to go there in any other case.

I actually thought the staff had mentioned that they would be doing a menu reboot, but as yet I've only seen the drink menu do the seasonal shift - or maybe I'll do as you say and stick to the snacks."
VictoriaBC,2yyjyq,LeftHandedOctopus,2,Sat Mar 14 02:38:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you were down voted, you're right.  I loved little jumbo with its a la carte styled menu.  The quality was top notch, and I loved putting together my own meal.  Last time I went the menu had changed away from a la carte, there was a new chef, and I had the worst quality steak that I've had in years.  The drinks are great though, and so is the staff.  I'll still give it a try, I'm hoping the steak was a one time failure."

VictoriaBC,2yqyxu,Stevegap,5,Thu Mar 12 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"We visited the potholes almost every weekend in the summer. We'd go with anywhere from 3 to 6 people at a given time (a few times it would only be two of us), and we would be very cautious at preliminary attempts. Practice breathing; going into a caves or tunnels only partially, then come back out, go in further on another attempt, and repeat until comfortable. Wetsuits were necessary, because even in mid summer, staying in for hours at a time is quite cold. What's more, some of the deep areas go down 70 feet. When you go that far it's incredibly cold; you can feel 3 different thermal levels.   Scariest part is getting stuck in tunnels, just remember you're only ""temporarily lodged."" Next to that would be returning from the very deep portions after staying down for a while, due to the fact that you don't anticipate how far down you've actually dove; when you start blacking out upon ascent 30 feet from the surface, it gets a bit scary.   Longest we had to hold our breath was just shy of 2 minutes.   My point is, we were super comfortable and familiar with everything when we filmed this."

VictoriaBC,2yr6pr,ninjatune,22,Thu Mar 12 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"Seeing as Health Canada just left all medical MJ patients without a supplier due to the recent changes to the act, that is why you are seeing these dispensaries. It's a natural progression of the health care industry and should not be stopped.    Most of them are low key and don't have a prominent store front and are on side streets etc. This one isn't, as it's at Oak Bay junction and in a medical building, so it will bear the brunt of all the brainwashed nimby's in this city.  You know, the one's that voted for Harper because CBC told them a majority would be better. The independent critical thinkers of our time you could say.  I have to say, as a client of  Leaf they run a tight ship and provide a valuable service.  You have to have an officieal doctors note, a documented conditions, fill out an application and provide picture ID just to apply.  You can't buy in bulk as it's a pharmacy for medicinal use only, not for the general public. It takes a couple of days for them to verify your conditions are legit via your doctor, and it's only for physical, not mental conditions as per Health Canada's guide.   It's great to be able to purchase quality product without the sketchy dealer / don't know where you got your product from kinda situation.  To many years of smoking herb full of fertilizer, grown in someones illegal setup in a rental. Not good for society by the old way.  Gangs, fires, guns and let's not forget the CIA drug runners swapping cocaine for BC bud at the border. It's a big business, and the best way to put crooks out of biz is take away their ability to make $$.  Support your local dispensary!  80 years of brainwashing people that pot is bad is over and it's time to get on with it.  There's a massive liquor store just down the road that has probably been responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of cases of violence / domestic violence over the years so why don't we shut it down first.  NIMBY! : )"

VictoriaBC,2yr6pr,skeletonwar,13,Thu Mar 12 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"You know, they have two massive hepa grade air filters to keep the odor down, they have a no loitering policy out front for obvious reasons.  Same as you can't drink your hooch in front of the liquor store right. Take that shit home. I have a pretty good nose and I don't smell anything in their lobby area, let alone in the building. They are just trying to get some leverage.  Also, complaining about the smell of a medicinal plant is low brow.  I mean, I don't want to smell fast food, but they pump that shit into the air all day, all over town.  I don't want to smell diesel and vehicle exhaust, but every where you go what is in your face?   This is just crap reporting overall, but what do you expect from our owned non independent media.    This is the same station that tried to sink Mayor Atwell by reporting on his private life, (in partnership with the TC rag). The privacy report form the BC Privacy Commissioner is due out in a couple of weeks and everyone will see what a bunch of owned media we have in this city.    Only a baby boomer aged mayor (Leonard), would think sticking spyware on the Mayor elect's PC was a wise move.

IME, going the private route was better for me. I got more for my money that way. What was on the lot in my price range was either a lot older than what I ended up buying or a lower quality brand in the same year (i.e. a 2008 Kia vs. a 2008 Toyota). I arranged with the seller to get the car inspected (went to the Esso station at Hillside and Shellbourne and would definitely recommend them for a pre-purchase inspection, they were fantastic).   Of all the lots I looked at, I was most comfortable with Galaxy Motors. They were the least ""used car salesman"" like. Other lots I felt REALLY pressured both to spend way more than I could afford and to test drive something.  Galaxy was reasonably relaxed although I did feel some pressure from them to look at financing (I had money in the bank to buy something and didn't want to get a loan)."

I lived in Kyoto for a bit in the 90s and then later Tokyo for most of the 00s. Ramen is one of the few meals where it's far too much work to do it right at home, but it's hard to find restaurants that do it right either.   Also...

Kuma ramen is chicken based and Foo downtown they are trying too hard with ingredients that don't match soup and screw up up.  It's ok for what it is.  Foo Ramen.  Depends on the day their tonkotsu soup can be good but it can be bad too.  The consistency of their chashupork is a challenge -- some days great other days not so much.  The soup base can taste pretty good.  Real negative for Foo is trying to hard with toppings that don't match the flavours of tonkotsu ramen -- like tomatoes. Don't try too hard.  Stick to the basics:  green onions, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts.  The acidic taste doesn't match ramen.    The best authentic ramen shop to Victoria is Santouka on Robson street which is actually a chain ramen shop from Japan."

There is a pretty nice course in nanaimo (bower park I believe).  It's an hour and a half or so to get there from victoria.  Pretty nice course, it also serves as a park.  So it's a nice walk, paved paths, and washrooms. Pender is a fantastic course, an the one that got me into the sport.  Ferry ride over but still worth doing from time to time.

I don't believe most arbutus trees are protected.  Garry Oaks are in Victoria proper.  probably worth checking as you need a permit (free) to prune/limb an oak.  Dead Arbutus branches are quite brittle and can fall without much warning, so depending where it is it could be dangerous.  When they do break off they can split down and damage the living part of the tree.  So it's likely a good idea to get the limb off."

Parking situations would be better if people had inventive to pay fines, as they wouldn't want to get fines.  If you're broke why would you take the risk of a bill you cannot afford... Why do broke students even have cars they get a free bus pass!"

Also Fishermans Wharf, like Oakbay you can feed the seals there, but its more charming as your on a floating dock amongst float houses.  Another fun thing to do is hit some of these places via water taxi from the inner harbour, end your journey at Spinakers Brewpub, the water taxi will drop you right at their dock. Another nice ride is down the paths along the Gallaping Goose, and Gorge Waterways. A walk or a ride through Beacon Hill Park, again that will bring you to Dallas Road and the ocean."

VictoriaBC,2yiwyr,adamoo403,6,Wed Mar 11 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"tldr:  The city is rife with rumours of secret tunnels.  At the range of ""a friend of a friend who worked at this place,"" or, ""I talked to this retired construction worker,"" there is a warren of hidden pathways under Old Town.  The dreamers invoke secret Chinatown smuggling and 19th-century construction lost under 21st century infrastructure.  Actually proven with photo evidence is less exciting.  Lots of walled-off doors in basements, supposition that the Wharf St. doorways led to some HBC storage, and the following knowns:    Extensive storm drain network that can be explored (at some serious risk) extending to Ross Bay and Oak Bay;  Tunnels connecting Legislative Assembly building, its Annex, and office building across Government  Laundry tunnels at the Empress"

There used to be ones under Market Square however they will deny that if you ask them. But they are no longer accessible able as the were covered in with store expansions. Or they have huge piles of needles in them. I have also seen rats the size of house cats downtown  so I could only imagine what they might look like if you ran into them in the tunnels

VictoriaBC,2yd6xw,toastycakes,3,Mon Mar 9 04:49:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is the same in both examples, though: representatives are being too risk-averse. On the speeding issue, they ignore the advice of the engineering staff because ""safety"", regardless of the advice of experts. But it probably isn't less safe, and there's the illusion that it could be more safe, so council votes in favor. With this Witty's Lagoon thing, representatives voted for the safest option, regardless of the fact that, yeah, there are plenty of places in the parks system, and elsewhere, that aren't perfectly safe. Most of us accept that risk as the price to pay for leaving the house, but apparently these folks, minus Ben Isitt, decided that leaving the house was still too dangerous, and so they got rid of a perfectly good access point to a nice park that probably just needed a quick repair job, one that likely would have cost no more than the price to remove it altogether.  It is the job of government representatives to navigate the nuances of decision making by balancing the competing needs of the public good. The engineering department can't be the only source of authority on these matters. However, it seems to me that in both of the above examples, the least-risky option was unanimously embraced, while little consideration was given to the nuances in each decision.

VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,rhetoric614,3,Tue Mar 10 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"There are over a dozen good swimming lakes within a 40 minute drive of the city, though many are much closer."
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,connern,4,Mon Mar 9 02:48:47 2015 UTC,The beaches in Parksville (Rathtrevor) are beautiful and warm in the summer.
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,ultcraka,2,Mon Mar 9 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"The water is never warm, that said there are a few spots that are much warmer than others. Wittys lagoon is the warmest ""beach"" in Victoria. Sandspit in Sydney.  Galiano has a cove by the camp grounds that is very warm. Parts of Tofino the sand gets really hot and thus when the tide comes in the water is ""warm""."
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,SirJohnEh,7,Sun Mar 8 20:49:49 2015 UTC,Heard good things about Toffino but want an urban adventure on the island :) thanks for the info though!

VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,ssigal,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:12:48 2015 UTC,"Sandspit in Sydney.    It's Sidney, and its ""Sidney Spit""   Its very warm (ambient temperature) but the water is SHOCKINGLY cold over there, its extremely tidal, and the water never has a chance to warm up."
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,rhetoric614,2,Tue Mar 10 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"My favourite places for swimming are Mount Douglas beach, Elk Lake, Witty's Lagoon, Thetis Lake, Esquimalt Lagoon. Have a quick google to figure out where they are."
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,slackshack,2,Mon Mar 9 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"Because of how the tidal flow works around here, most of the water around Victoria does stay right around that 7-9 degree temperature all year round.  However, if you're willing to make the drive north of Nanaimo, the water in the strait doesn't get mixed in with the open ocean as much, which means in the summer it makes it closer to 12-14 degrees fairly regularly."
VictoriaBC,2yd9jy,nickiday,2,Mon Mar 9 04:23:14 2015 UTC,The ocean is basically never warm enough for a swim. Still gorgeous though!
