miband,3e3pnu,theimmc,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Mine messed up while flashing new firmware. It didn't flash properly, and now when I try to reset the Band to start fresh, the bluetooth connection doesn't last enough to send the reset command. :)"
miband,3e3pnu,ado010,2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"Well it started getting really bad, like needing to charge once a week. Then wouldn't charge or sync. Finally today was vibrating when plugged in non stop or blinking three red, which I've heard it's the ""blue screen of death"". Won't sync to my phone so it's going away into a drawer. :("
miband,3e3pnu,Astra_Starr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:55:38 2015 UTC,"Mine's heading down that path too. Charging more and more frequently, randomly locking up then coming back days later. Now it's locking up almost all the time, not tracking when it is alive and can't send any commands to it with gliderun as it seems to be stuck in some sort of repairing loop."

miband,3e37qw,mariuscole21,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm always back and forth between Mi Band Tools and Mi Band Notify Pro. After a recent update on July 18 in the Play Store that fixed my previous issues, I must say, Mi Band Notify (PRO) is currently my app in use mainly because of the Step Counter widget on the homescreen. Very functional, no need to open and sync Mi Fit. Less time wasted to view a quick stat. There is also a widget to show the battery life and quick disable of notifications. I guess the next step would be to get a sleep widget. But so far Mi Band Notify (PRO) has been working out very well."
miband,3e37qw,theimmc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:54 2015 UTC,Does the widget appear to affect battery drain on either Band or phone?
miband,3e37qw,Tom452820038,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell at an early stage I would say that there is no additional battery drain (so far). The widget itself isn't in real-time and only updates the step/battery status when you press the refresh button on the top right of each widget.  It appears to always be 1:1 on steps (when refreshed) as compared to Mi Fit's count, so its working as designed.  Though its only been a few hours, everything (both notifications and widgets) are working as they should. This is especially useful since Mi Fit seems to take a few tries to sync sometimes."

There are literally dozens of budget smart watches and pedometers that can be had for cheap, however, when you start to use the app and it is total garbage, then the device becomes more of a paper weight.   By no means is the Mi Fit app perfect, but compare it to the knock off versions ""DayDay Band"" for example - grammatical errors, bugs, compatibility, zero updates after launch, and you'll see why the cheaper devices fail. They are in it for the quick buck and not the long term. For example, look at that ad and see it's ""features"": Altitude Meter (you mean altimeter?), Stopmatch (you mean stopwatch?), Burglar alarm (ADT? wth?). I'm scared to see what the app looks like.   Dry specs alone will only get you half way. If the app is complete shyte, then it won't have a long usable life."

miband,3dllo6,slashy1302,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already received multiple requests for these. I'm currently working on more important features than indications that are already part of original Mi Fit application :) I might (and very likely will) add these later, but in my opinion it is better to develop new features first and then replicate something that is already partially available in Mi Fit (battery indication, steps indication). Widget to toggle notifications on/off does not really make any sense in my opinion since there is priority mode support in MBT."
miband,3dllo6,x_minus_one,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:02:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that the toggle doesn't make sense, I was just listing the available ones.

miband,3dllo6,mariuscole21,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:02 2015 UTC,"I bought Mi Band Tools, I like it so far.  It lets me disable notifications when my phone's screen is on and only enable them when the phone is on silent, which is a feature I really wanted.

I also don't recall it updating firmware when I switched to the Play store version.  My motivation for switching is that the tweaked version crashes whenever I look at my daily summary (or whatever that screen is). If you don't encounter any issues, it may be best to leave good enough alone, unless you're prepared to brick it.  If you want to do it, the steps I took - may not be necessary, but I was being extra cautious - was this :   I didn't do this, but someone suggested making sure the app has synced with the server. Not sure how to do this without using another phone. Unpair using app Uninstall app (remember your MIUI login credentials) Reboot the phone (just for the heck of it) Install from Play Store. Run, login. Pair. If this fails, try charging it from your computer while pairing.   I recommend Mi Band Tools for notifications as well. No self interest here : I paid for it, I'm not receiving any kickbacks, I do not know the developer (except for a few discussions here)."

miband,3csrig,mariuscole21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:58 2015 UTC,$14.99 free shipping? I wonder how fast the item would arrive to North America. Keep us posted.
miband,3csrig,theimmc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:16:47 2015 UTC,Actually $3 by air mail to the U.S. Still a few cents cheaper than TinyDeal. Order placed.
miband,3csrig,ladfrombrad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"Ordered one purely out of curiosity (and with Paypal protection), hit me up in a few weeks time and I'll tell ya if it's a POS or not."
miband,3csrig,letsgofightdragons,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:35:11 2015 UTC,Lol I think that's hilarious and ingenious. It might've been TD's handiwork.
miband,3csrig,mariuscole21,2,Tue Jul 14 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to know about the sensor dimensions, mainly to Frankenstein a Mi Band core into that strap."
miband,3csrig,theimmc,3,Fri Jul 10 17:45:51 2015 UTC,When / if mine arrives (hopefully in 2 weeks) I'll let you know.
miband,3csrig,mariuscole21,2,Fri Jul 10 20:26:35 2015 UTC,The sensor is the same size. You can put the Zeaband sensor in a Mi Band strap and vice versa.
miband,3csrig,theimmc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll try to see where we can find the strap only, no luck so far as the product is probably too recent."
miband,3ctvt4,suhrob,3,Fri Jul 10 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"With stock app, 3 alarms. These alarms don't need your phone to be nearby. With 3rd party apps such as Mi Band Tools or Mi Band Notification, yes. In a completely quiet room, someone sitting next to you might hear a very faint buzzing, unless you have it on a table or something that will amplify the vibration. 3rd party apps can control the # of vibrations for notifications."
miband,3ctvt4,theimmc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:11:08 2015 UTC,Thank you very much this is very helpful. I'll order it then!
miband,3ctvt4,ParkingSeal,2,Fri Jul 10 20:57:40 2015 UTC,1) Three alarms are possible and you can set them on daily repeat. 2) Dont know 3) Vibration is not noticeable even when its absolutly quite

miband,3crz7p,fitman_s,2,Fri Jul 10 08:09:47 2015 UTC,I purchased the same one a few weeks ago. It was the cheapest I could find but I'm sure what is earned in savings will be paid back with a longer shipping time.

miband,3cq40r,McGuinness_CGN,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I hope it is not the same as what I observed on mine. I also saw the would not recharge unless on USB and the failure to record. In addition I had an abnormal recording of 28,000 steps before that. It also had repeated failures with connecting. Then it buzzed for a long time, lights flashed in a running pattern (up and down the length of the Band), and died completely."
miband,3cq40r,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"I can't relate as far as not recording activity goes - but I feel like I did experience the same issue when plugging it into an outlet to charge. Lights would come on for a second then go off. I plugged it into a PS4 USB port and it worked just fine. There's something online about how the draw is so low that it might not be charged by things such as the Xiaomi Power Bank, so maybe that occurs with outlets sometimes, as well? Maybe certain power bricks don't recognize enough power draw from the Band and they don't charge it. Just a thought. Good luck."
miband,3cny5k,pabes,2,Thu Jul 9 11:20:52 2015 UTC,"Almost Exactly the same case as mine but my phone is nexus 5. As far as I know from my web searches, it might be about server error."

miband,3cny5k,omgChubbs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:49:16 2015 UTC,Same here. Using a gs4.
miband,3cojp5,thrBladeRunner,4,Thu Jul 9 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"I use it as a necklace (with android app) - as far as steps I can't say there is any big difference, compared to wrist placement.  It seems to be far worse when it comes to sleep tracking though. I found the wrist placement to be pretty accurate but the neck placement has big issues when it comes to sense when I fall asleep and wake up. And sometimes also awake time during the night - and I haven't started sleepwalking."
miband,3cojp5,EagleStClair,3,Fri Jul 10 05:45:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. Doesn't look like I'll end up using it as a necklace. Thank you for your insight!
miband,3cojp5,jazavchar,4,Fri Jul 10 10:57:32 2015 UTC,Why not wear it on your leg in that situation? Just a thought.
miband,3cojp5,mrwomble,3,Thu Jul 9 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"Good idea. I could do that in those situations, for sure. Thanks for the suggestion."
miband,3cnvoc,Mazo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:49:03 2015 UTC,Same here i just order a new miband because it was the same if i get mine with the warenty to China. I hope its firmware problem hehe
miband,3cmnpb,Cam_86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"If you feel like GearBest is giving you the runaround which will result in no action it wouldn't hurt to try Xiaomi Customer Service . I'm not sure if they'll need some sort of product code. Hopefully not give you any fuss about buying from a 3rd party instead of direct from the Mi store.  I doubt they will raise much fuss about needing to receive the damaged piece since the cost of postage is greater than the cost of the part itself, but maybe they will. Wouldn't hurt to send them an email and maybe send some pics to show you have the item in your possession.   Let us know how it works out."
miband,3cmnpb,mariuscole21,2,Thu Jul 9 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"They said they understand how i was screwed over, but as they do not offer warranty service unless the item is bought through their online retailer, they cant offer any help. So yeah, I'm outta luck.  Should add i bought my miband back when they were in the $30 range(late 2014) and figured i had gotten a steal at $25... Seems its less of a deal when the thing breaks(I would guess from getting different firmware updates, all from official mi apk's, mind you)  I guess i'll just rebuy it elsewhere... Gearbest is on my shit-list now :p(I have had other run-ins with dx and focalprice, but if i dig my heels in with them, and provide proof of damage or defectiveness, they usually do the honest thing and replace or refund. Not the case with gearbest. After a dozen messages back and forth, their best answer was to give me a $5 discount if i rebuy it from them)"
miband,3cmnpb,mariuscole21,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:48 2015 UTC,Just saw the part that says they want the return... Postage itself would almost pay for a replacement band. Maybe they did this by design.
miband,3cmnpb,I_can_vouch_for_that,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:43:07 2015 UTC,It is.  Which is why I never expect warranty RMA on overseas online China products.
miband,3cmnpb,mariuscole21,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give it a shot just to see what happens and try to warranty 2 straps that lasted less 2-3 weeks. I purchased 2 bands from a 3rd party in mid June which I mentioned. I also mentioned that it would be impractical for me to invest $10 to ship it back, I'm in the US. I did purchase 5 items from them directly last week so maybe they'll take that into consideration as a customer, but I don't have any expectations to get it resolved, just testing the waters."
miband,3cmnpb,mariuscole21,3,Thu Jul 9 03:10:49 2015 UTC,Well that was quick. Basically they do not warranty items purchased from third parties. The only way to get an item warrantied is if the product was purchased directly from the Mi Store.
miband,3cmnpb,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:18:05 2015 UTC,I figured that's what they'll say and didn't bother when my (eBay purchased) unit bit the dust. Thanks for confirming.
miband,3cmnpb,sylon,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:25:54 2015 UTC,These literally cost chump change.  Do you really expect any warranty? If you do then buy fitbit.  I bought my mi band for 12 usd. It's so cheap it's disposable.
miband,3ck9qv,puddywuds,4,Wed Jul 8 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Been using mine for a couple of months now. Ordered from them, it's the real thing."
miband,3ck9qv,coutinhop,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"By quickly looking at the ad, I think you should be okay. They are referencing the ""Mi Fit"" app to download in their description. The feedback reviews look fine too. If they were selling a fake, they would be referencing a different app (not Mi Fit) like DayDay Band or DAMI. The feedback from users say it works fine. You should be in the clear."

miband,3ck9qv,I_can_vouch_for_that,2,Wed Jul 8 19:01:39 2015 UTC,I bought ten ( 10 ) from a subsidiary stores of theirs and it's been fine.

miband,3cifw6,theimmc,4,Wed Jul 8 03:57:46 2015 UTC,"Both appear to be genuine, and I can't tell any difference between the two when inspecting the bracelet, the device, and the charger.  On the left is the box I received it in when I bought it from eBay seller better-source about 2 months ago. On the right is the box I received it in yesterday.  The larger box is of a much higher quality cardboard. The smaller box is a bit more than half the size of the larger box, with the items just stuffed inside. There's a piece of paper with instructions in Chinese. There's no marking on the box to indicate it is from Xiaomi.  Maybe the seller is repackaging this to cut cost with shipping (he is selling it for $2 less). I have no problem with that - I'd rather have $2 than a box I'm tossing. Just curious what kind of packaging you guys received your Mi Band in."
miband,3cifw6,xTurmoil,4,Wed Jul 8 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"I actually ordered mine from that same eBay seller and the device came in the smaller box. On the eBay listing, the seller did say that the mi band wouldn't come in the original box but the device does appear to be genuine. I've had the mi band for about 3 weeks now and haven't had any issues with it."
miband,3cifw6,mariuscole21,3,Wed Jul 8 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I missed the fact that he revised the listing. I'm not concerned about it being fake, I'm just curious. I guess the seller discarded the original box in China to ship them over in bulk."
miband,3cifw6,Adzam1,4,Wed Jul 8 05:42:31 2015 UTC,"Correct, many sellers remove the item and replace the box. This makes it cheaper especially if they have the first issue packaging (pre- Jan 26, 2015) which where taller boxes. The current boxes are about half the height.   Of course if your key indicators are there (Mi logo on back of sensor, ""designed by xiaomi"" in the band, device syncs to Mi Fit app) you're pretty much in the clear. The stopping point of fakes vs. reals are that they aren't compatible with Mi Fit and the seller or instructions tells you to download a half assed app like DAMI, Day Day Band, or some others."
miband,3cifw6,squeakyL,3,Wed Jul 8 06:22:55 2015 UTC,"The smaller box is what Mi calls ""simple packaging"".... Both are offered on tinydeals for a few bucks difference."
miband,3cetaf,laughing-cavalier,2,Tue Jul 7 10:29:10 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that the Play Store version no longer has this feature is indicative of how this works (i.e. not very well). I never tried it myself even when I was running the tweaked version, sorry."
miband,3cetaf,theimmc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:54 2015 UTC,I just installed the playstore version and it has this feature. It is under the top right settings -> profile -> additional features. It includes jumprope and situps.
miband,3cetaf,frnzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"Which version are you running? I went over it again and I definitely don't see the jumprope / situp setting. And I remember seeing it when I was running Tweaked.  I'm running 1.5.453. Tapping on the menu icon, I get Settings, Alarm, Profile, Accounts, Share.  Under Settings, I have Find Band, Progress light color, Band location, Unlock device using band, Incoming calls, Mi Band notifications (on/off), Activity stats notification (on/off), Sleep data notification (on/off), Unpair, Firmware version.  Under Profile, I have my name (tapping it  shows me my stats, with the option to sign out). I also have Set goal, Units, and About.  Maybe it shows different things on different phones. I'm running it on a OnePlus One, CM12s."
miband,3cetaf,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:24:49 2015 UTC,1+1 Cm12.1 nightlies for me. Maybe different app in different regions. Try the one from apkmirror  http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/xiaomi-technology/mi-fit/mi-fit-1-5-453-android-apk-download/
miband,3cetaf,frnzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe they figure that lazy Americans don't skip or do situps? :D  I'm not willing to experiment with the one from apkmirror. Don't need the skip / sit-up counters, and some day it feels like the Band would break if I just look at it wrong. I've already killed one Band somehow."
miband,3cetaf,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:47:32 2015 UTC,I think you're right - it seems good skipping technique is to move only your wrists to turn the rope which means smaller motions for the band to pick up. Makeshift workaround? Would probably work better on a necklace.
miband,3cetaf,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:59:04 2015 UTC,"Or strapped to the ankle, maybe?  Are you trying to have it count # of jumps, or calculate calories burned? How is the result inaccurate when it is on your wrist?"
miband,3cetaf,theimmc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:37:37 2015 UTC,It's meant to count the number of jumps and is ridiculously off when straps to your wrist - it'll pick up around 10% of jumps. I'm putting this down to the fact that your wrists don't actually move much when skipping.   I imagine putting it in your shoe would work too. My method managed to get 78 out of around 80 jumps. Ankles too fat for strap. :'(
miband,3cdp66,IanGameWoof,3,Tue Jul 7 02:44:42 2015 UTC,You could try one of these suggestions.
miband,3cdp66,BEER-FOR-LUNCH,2,Tue Jul 7 02:57:31 2015 UTC,"I ended up just using about  . 5"" strip of super clear packing tape around the unit and band.   Not ideal,  but i feel confident that i wont lose it."
miband,3cdp66,Sniperman,2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:02 2015 UTC,"I got some clear hair-ties from Target, normally used to band small braids.  They work(ed) great! I lost my entire band while I went tubing last week, so I have to order another one."
miband,3cdp66,tehxeno,2,Wed Jul 8 14:01:00 2015 UTC,The leather style type ones hold the unit down in some sort of bracket held by screws.
