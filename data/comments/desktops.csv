desktops,3e4vp4,Nazfera2,3,Wed Jul 22 07:13:45 2015 UTC,Does Clover not run like crap for you and flicker every time you try to move the window?
desktops,3e4vp4,-haven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"The flickering is caused by the fact that the Clover window and the Explorer windows it handles are running in separate processes. For some reason, Windows is not good at synchronizing UI events across processes. You can also see this effect when resizing any window - because the window border and title bars of windows are handled by a separate process (DWM), the client area of the window appears to flicker, because it is drawn by the process which created the window."
desktops,3e4vp4,baggyzed,2,Wed Jul 22 07:18:03 2015 UTC,"What is the theme for Clover? Also, what is all the stuff at the bottom, which apps, why so much?"
desktops,3e4vp4,bmancreations,4,Wed Jul 22 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"I made it myself using my background to be my titlebar so they match. Everything else is left to default other then a few that were changed to be white. You can make one yourself here.  Starting from the left I have:   SVP Manager - For Realtime interpolation of my videos to 60 FPS. f.lux - For automatic color change of my screen from sunset to sunrise. Xonarswitch - Its used for my global audio settings for my soundcard. Eagleget - Used to replace the chrome downloader, much faster and helps to organize all my downloads into folders like media, compressed, documents, and software. Also can download videos off of any site. Steam - Gaming platform Discord - A new VOIP program that means to replace teamspeak and Skype. It has done it for me and my friends. We all use it for regular talk and gaming. Teamviewer - Lets me remote into peoples computers that I have worked on before including family and friends so anytime they have a problem I can just show myself in. Also lets me remote into my own computer from my phone. Google Chrome - Browser Process Lasso - Dynamically controls the priority class of programs on my system to make sure I always have control over my system even under 100% CPU load. Windows does a terrible job on its own. With the program I get guarantee that no hiccups or freezes will ever occur with it on and I never have gotten any hiccups with my system in the last year with it on. It also has no performance reduction on encoding or gaming. Tested that too. This sounds like snake oil but they have a demo program you can use to test out their system. What it does is puts insane load on your system and lets you switch the Process Lasso core service on and off. MSI Afterburner - GPU overclocking and system monitoring program. Rivatuner - Displays an FPS counter when I play games. Malwarebytes Antimalware - Protects from malware Everything Search Engine - Lets you search your whole system with instant results, no loading as everything is already indexed. Displayfusion - Lets you customize how your multi-monitor setup works. Has a lot of features for just default windows use as well as well as global hotkeys for anything you want."

desktops,3dpciq,OfficialZino,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:14:04 2015 UTC,I just call it Flat Arch b/c the wallpaper in combination with the icon theme gives it a rather flat looking theme.
