shittyHDR,396z3s,redditisforthegays,6,Tue Jun 9 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"I guess? Theres no real haloing, the colors arent crazy saturated, there are no weird local contrast enhancements. All I can see is some of the shadow areas are boosted.  Im just not seeing it, this doesnt even really look like an HDR image to me."
shittyHDR,396z3s,mashuto,7,Tue Jun 9 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Check the blacks in all the peoples clothes in the foreground. Also the blacks in the shadows of the trees in the far background. Not too mention the odd coloration of the skin tones, it seems super vibrant from the HDR effect, but the editor toned down the saturation to compensate. This is classically extra lazy, absolutely undeserving of a front page, shitty HDR. Maybe it's really shitty cause the editor wanted just a slight HDR effect, so it wouldn't be noticeable, but in the end it is clearly visible. Lazy editing for a major publication. It stinks, and I don't like it."
shittyHDR,396z3s,philphotos83,2,Tue Jun 9 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"What I see on my monitor is that the shadow areas (the blacks) have been boosted and are maybe tending towards blue in coloration and a bit noisy (from being boosted).  Yes, local contrast is a bit high, but nothing all that crazy. Yes, the colors might be a bit strange, and slightly saturated, but again, nothing crazy.  Im not going to argue about whether its deserving of a front page on a major magazine (I am more annoyed by the fact that its crooked).  What I think of when I think of shitty hdr is halos everywhere, local contrast enhancements that make a dark ground brighter than a bright sky which has now been rendered darker. Crazy over the top saturation boosts. This image might have some of those features, but they are just really minor.  As far as an HDR image (if it is really HDR and not just a slight HDR effect) I think is just pretty minor overall. I have seen way way way (and in the past created way way worse)."
shittyHDR,396z3s,mashuto,2,Tue Jun 9 21:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well see that's where we differ. It's my opinion that HDR is shitty in every application, light or heavy. So maybe I'm a little bias in this situation."
shittyHDR,396z3s,philphotos83,2,Tue Jun 9 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. It does seem to be used as a crutch, but again I am not sure if thats even what it is in this image or just some editing techniques that slightly resemble what we think of as HDR.  And that leads me to this. HDR is not always shitty, HDR simply means high dynamic range, and can encompass any number of techniques for increasing the apparent dynamic range of an image beyond what a camera can capture in a single frame.  So when you say HDR, do you mean all HDR or that tonemapped HDR look that became popular from programs like photomatix?"
shittyHDR,396z3s,mashuto,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"Im not familiar with photomatix. I mean hdr that has opened shadows, toned down highlights, tonal contrasts,  and vibrant colors that do not resemble the high dynamic range of the human eye. This is a good example of what I'm talking about. Shadows are beautiful and should be appreciated. Tonal contrast should be applied subtly, the crunchy look is unnecessary and it doesn't take much to achieve it. All of this is obviously just my opinion. I totally take advantage of the crazy amount of dynamic range my camera offers me, but you definitely wouldn't call my images HDR."

shittyHDR,32wij9,pgrim91,3,Fri Apr 17 12:36:04 2015 UTC,"You could say that yes, it is, but then the examples in this sub are all just shitty art.   In shitty HDR, the natural focal points usually created in a scene by light and shadow are eliminated by forcing everything to have the same tonality. Contrast is destroyed. Haloing is haphazard and without intent. The result is that the images have even less visual impact than they would have had as just poorly lit photographs. Our eyes crave focus and contrast. Good artists can play with ambiguity and delight us with the results; but truly shitty HDR is just a neon pukesplash of aimless colour.  ...that I love to see examples of anyway, hence subscribing here :p"

You can't ""HDR"" a single image. You can simulate it, but it'll never look as good. The detail in the darker/lighter zones of a compiled image just isn't present in a single image, and pseudo-HDRi just makes them look washed out. It is completely based on lighting, trying to highlight the darker spots, and tone down the brighter ones, using different exposures, to get a more ""real life"" looking photo.
