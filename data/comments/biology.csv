In Canada most universities will let you in to a program if there is a prof willing to supervise you, if you care a lot about research and take time to write to professors who research is interesting, you stand a very good chance of getting what you want ;)"

Another thing I'm kinda worried about is that I have a terrible memory when it comes to remembering scientific terms (one of the main reasons my grades still aren't really amazing). I'm terrified of sounding like an idiot when talking to professors about certain topics. I'm not sure how on earth to fix that though...

Get an A in a class like cell biology, talk to the professor, see what research they're doing, get into their lab.  Take lab classes. Get a lot of experience with many techniques. Being good at biology is like being good with a woman. You gotta have the knowledge and the theory, but you also have to be good with your hands.  I did exactly this, scored a position doing immunochemistry for the pharmaceutical industry. It's not fantastic, but with a little effort you can use it as a stepping stone to bigger and better things. A bench scientist with a few years of solid experience in the right industry is (literally) worth their weight in gold.  Biology can be lucrative. Grad school will help, if/when you're ready for it.

biology,3e051x,lime490,10,Tue Jul 21 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Big picture suggestions without specific advice from a guy in his 60s.  Most people change their majors at least once in college, so as an incoming sophomore, it's not a big deal to change it. You've had freshman course, so far, right, so it doesn't seem to me you'll have wasted any time on courses that won't count toward graduation. (In my freshman year, you were supposed to take earth sciences as your basic science course. It was full, so I took physics 101 instead and never had any problems as a result.)   If you're interested in science, talk to a counselor about what jobs there are in science. I would also stop paying attention to other students who offer advice -- my recollection is that other students knew no more than I did on jobs and fields. They just make stuff up. I've read some of the posts here, and I think you'd get better advice here, assuming people aren't making stuff up. :->  Now here's the secret to life: no matter what your degree is, it doesn't really matter in the big picture. Having a college degree counts. I majored in speech-drama with a teacher's certificate. I never taught a day of school my entire life. I spent four years in the Air Force (I'd intended to make a career of it, then teach, but I discovered I wasn't interested in the military life), then went to law school. I finally found my life's work at the age of 30.  Make the best decisions you can based on the information you have when you make the decision, including information based on other decisions you've made. Live with the decision awhile and see if it's working for you. I didn't stay in any of my planned careers, so don't worry if you pick the wrong one the first time or two. My wife, as a counter-example, did stay in her planned career, but she's off in a related field and not in the lab where she planned to stay.  TL;DR: The important thing to remember is that you can make decisions now and change them later. I didn't stay in the field of law I'd originally planned on because I didn't like it and switched to a different area which I thoroughly enjoyed. Mostly. Don't think you're bound for life because of decisions you make between your freshman and sophomore years."

biology,3e051x,cenancestor,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"Within the US you really need to be around the Northeast Corridor or California. Specifically Boston, New York/New Jersey, and San Diego probably have the most jobs in biotech/pharma/biomed and related fields. Unfortunately if you're not near one of these centers your options for work will be very limited to non-existent.  As for outside the US I can't speak with much authority. However Switzerland and Germany are good bets, but you'll have to ask more about that from a European who works in whatever field that interests you."
biology,3e051x,EdBacon,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'll try to be a bit more positive about a BS in biology.  It is difficult to do much with a degree in pure/general biology. However, a lot can be done when it is fused with another field. Mostly in academia but there are quite a few options for non-academic work. However getting a higher degree in some subfield of biology will only help you secure the required experience that most biology undergraduates do not get.  Some examples:   Quantitative Biology - This is what I study right now, the degree is fantastic and it exposes you to a whole load of things like the physics, computer science and math tools that can be used to tackle biology problems. Highly useful in biology and very versatile if you decide to switch fields as those three tools are highly sought after. Bioinformatics / Genetics - A very computational field but is highly profitable to work in. Sequencing companies and centres will hire you, or you can work in research to optimize and make algorithms more efficient. The computer skills you learn here are amazing and they are very transferrable. Plus you can work in forensics. Health - Any sub-specialization in health (eg Public Health) is great. You can become an inspector or an advisor to cities that are developing their infrastructure. You could work in Asia where the cities are developing so fast that they need people like you to advise what is the best way to lay out a city. Biophysics - Mostly research but this is insanely cool. Biotechnology / Biomedical Engineering - develop devices and the technologies that doctors can use to better healthcare. The big wave right now is in personalized medicine. Work on a patentable technology - There are many accelerator programmes (IndieBio) right now that are helping young biotech companies develop a business around their ideas. There are many companies outside the world of Pharma that recruit scientists to work on an exciting technology like this one company that is building personalized cancer detection devicies (EpicSciences) Ecology / Evolution / Conservation - Great because people care about the environment more and more, and we want to protect and understand how to conserve it. Great field if you have passion and allows you to work outside of a lab.   All in all, people do not study biology because they expect to have a high paying job. They do it because they enjoy asking questions about life and using their knowledge to make nature do things for them.  Good Luck!"
biology,3e051x,iamzaf,3,Tue Jul 21 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"I graduated with an Hon. BSc in Bio year and a half ago. Currently unemployed, but not for lack of trying. Seriously, like others have said, get out now. Find something else if there is something you'd rather do. If you don't really have a serious passion for it and a clear direction you want to go, you'll end up with a lot of debt and not much of a job to show for it.  It's incredibly competitive job field, and basically employers want a minimum of a MSc, but preferably a PhD. Or, they want you to have 5+ years experience in a specific field of Biology. The job market today is vastly different than it was even 5 years ago. So, if you do work whilst you're getting your degree, you may have a shot. But a general biology degree is a crapshoot really. You should think about specialising, like some of the other posters here have done. (It seemed to me that most of the research/work now is being done in genetics, microbio, biochem, and biotech.) If you don't want to work in a lab, that's really tough. Not only is field work really difficult (it takes a certain type of person), but it's becoming really hard to even get into unless you're willing to relocate and work for free, thus have a nice nestegg to use to your advantage upon graduation. I always wanted to do field work but I'm finding impossible since I have so much debt to take care of and no ability to just volunteer or ""intern"" to gain the field experience necessary (not to mention my urban setting doesn't help). Even grunt work in a lab is scarce. They don't even give you a second glance even for a so-called ""entry level"" job without 10 years experience or a post-doc lol.  In my last year of my degree, I did volunteer work with a few grad students with their research in biofuels and they told me, basically, you're screwed unless you've been gaining extra-curricular work/skills experience the whole time, cos without a post-grad degree, you MUST have loads of specialised experience. Which means you should have figured out what you wanted to specialise in a while ago. Sucks. Cos I never realised that, was never told, never warned. It was just a given that you get an undergrad science degree then you get a science job just like that. That's very far from reality nowadays. So, definitely look into doing lab work with profs or something, or at least trying out different options (field work, lab work, job shadowing, variable courses) to at least narrow done where your interests lie."

They've already sunk the money into the degree, and they're already facing the real world, again, myself included. This doesn't even count those who've pursued advanced degrees and still haven't had much luck. You just finished your freshman year; that leaves you with plenty of time to figure out what you want to do. Do some traveling, volunteer in some wacky outfit, or take some classes that sound interesting to you. Do something to break the monotony of schooling, and maybe you'll find something you really like. If you find out you like biology, that's great! Volunteer in a lab, do an internship at a company, but don't actually do your schooling in it. You will not learn anything transferable or valuable outside of science. Trust us when we say that it's a bad decision, at least for the foreseeable future."

That is, you don't go into biology to make money, you go in because you find the field fascinating and eventually it'll work out. If you just want good job prospects switch to comp sci or business or IT. I'm a 30 year old junior in college studying for a BS in biology because I love the field. I plan on going to grad school and will be happy to do anything that keeps me involved in the sciences/education over what my prospects were without it. Hell I could end up working at Starbucks and I'd still be happy with my education because I studied something I loved. You should do the same.   You don't study biology for money, you study it because you love it. If you don't love it, get out, no shame an extra year isn't going to put you in that much hurt (and I say another year to get something like Comp Sci or Engineering done) unless you were stupid with your college choice.  Now, if you want to stick with biology and want to make money, go to medical school/vet school/pharmacy school. Sure you won't be rich for another 15 years but you'll have job security. If you want to make it work in biology as a field of work there's tons of great suggestions in this thread on how to make yourself employable. Biology bachelor is not a terminal degree, hardly any science degree is terminal, there's so much depth and continued learning to take on that you need more than 4 years (generally, of course its not an absolute thing)to become good enough to do the jobs.

(Using only specific college from within my University). We graduate more biology than any other field and we're not having trouble placing graduates within the field or out of the field into jobs.   You've got 2-3 years left, switch majors if you want good job outlooks, stick with it if you love the science. I was once in the middle of nowhere in the midwest too, school had a 90% rate of matching to medical schools for biology grads so there's options ahead of you in biology I transferred out of need to help my family or I'd still be sitting in a classroom in the middle of nowhere happily chugging along towards my degree.

I realized that I really didn't like biology at all during my sophomore year and put myself on track to also get a BA in biochemistry. I'm starting my PhD in organic in a few weeks. My point is don't feel trapped by hearing that it's hard to get into grad school or that you have to pick a career in biology. I say wait until you take more bio classes and see what you like when you delve into specific subfields before you worry too much about your career path. Focus on grades and lab experience for now.

I will say that a plain BS biology is pretty much useless. The only job I have been able to find that is relevant to my degree is teaching biology labs part time at a community college which doesn't pay well and is pretty stressful.   I have tossed around a few possible ideas and eventually decided to go into clinical laboratory science since it's only 1 year of school if you already have a BS and the work sounds really interesting to me since I am interested in pathology. I won't get rich from it but it pays enough to live comfortably, and there is a high demand for certified CLS's in most of the US. I will be done next summer and I am really excited!

(not sure how long but at least 750 million years, more likely longer since the oldest found multicellular life is a 750mio year old sponge fossil, we share the trait multicellularity with sponges and all other metazoa, so our single celled common ancestor has to be older than that)"

So instead of simply writing the name of something and its definition, make a question and have the name be the answer. I've found that the process of creating the question helps it to stick as opposed to just writing down the definition verbatim as I saw it in a textbook or powerpoint slide. Do your best to make your questions somewhat original and then go over the questions. Bonus points if you make a test and include other multiple choice ""wrong"" answers. Take your test, make notes of the ones you missed, and focus on those topics to look over again. Take your test over and repeat until you don't miss any of your questions.  Also, draw. Draw a lot. Need to remember all the organelles? Draw a cell. Label it. Need to remember a certain signaling pathway? Draw out a little diagram. Need to remember the proteins in the electron transport chain? Draw the mitochondrial membrane and the proteins and label them. Similar to creating a test, the process of creating diagrams/pictures helps to reinforce the information and then gives you a study tool to use that isn't just a bunch of text."

I'm 'in' higher education; I actually am a supervisor in a program that has students who have taken 'historically difficult courses' (especially Biology, A&P, and other science major weedouts) facilitate study groups for current students, so we do a LOT of 'how to learn'.  Your first step should be reading before you come into class, or watching a video if that's your speed. Khan Academy, your textbook; prelearn before every class, even if it's just a little. Prelearn the day before and then sleep. Sleep cements memory. Concepts are far easier when you're not being introduced to them first time in class.  Everyone who suggests drawing is right. Doesn't matter how good you are at drawing. Draw. Find out if colors help you; they might, they help me.    If you can teach it, you know it. Make sure you're teaching it as deeply as someone would need to learn if they were a science major.  The key factor of long-term knowledge retention is not exactly studying. It's testing. Test yourself. Often. Since you're medical track, you'll need to summon up your science knowledge for your various exams. Keep personal test banks. Not of multiple choice exclusively, though some of those are good. Keep a running list of all concepts a chapter goes over (good textbooks have a list ready for you) and be able to short-answer any part of any concept. Find online testbanks from reputable colleges that provide answer keys; use them before you test.  Mind-map. Keep color-coded ones. Write a word like 'mitosis'. Play the association game. Illustrate the process. Write what kinds of cells undergo it. Do this every chapter for as many of the key issues as you can; it's going to help you build associations, which improve recollection across the board. When you test in classes that require a study ethic and you can't instantly answer a question, write down everything that comes to mind that you KNOW. Then figure out an answer from there.  A specific tech suggestion; Microsoft Onenote and a Wacom Bamboo have really improved my own personal process. With this setup, I use my laptop in class to take notes that I can reference forever, and keyword search, export to PDF, and make edits, add color, insert space and expand on ideas. I can also insert figures and screencaps on the fly, or annotate my professor's powerpoints.   Most importantly, I'm not just typing out the information- which is less effective than the kinesthetic response one gets from physically writing something down.  You won't be able to be 100% all techniques done to completion all the time. Find out what works for you.   Also, if you're taking Bio 2 in the fall, I suggest starting a Coursera or other program for free ASAP in Biology 1, or finding Biology 1 tests with keys from other schools and taking them as though you were in a testing environment.  Working with another set of standards will give you an idea of whether or not the lowered standards you're exceeding are even on par with expectations successive courses will have for you. I don't want to be rude, but a 6-weeks course with open book testing may be even more damaging than you realize. I am in two summer courses right now. They are drowning me. As they should.   For future classes, go to ratemyprofessor and find a fair, but not easy, professor with no reputation for open book exams. Your professor is not serving their students well by reducing requirements simply because people failed, especially if studying definitions was sufficient to score a C+. I had this problem for Precalculus, though not with open book exams, and it made Calculus very tough."
biology,3e0af1,charliequine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:26 2015 UTC,"I am in two summer courses right now. They are drowning me. As they should.   I feel you there. Two courses (one introductory) and I feel swamped from wake up to bed. I'm lucky though, one is statistics so its a matter of putting the time in for the grade, but the second semester intro to bio is harder than I remember the first semester being, though I am at a much better school now and my previous institution didn't have a second semester of biology.  I actually responded to ask you about the Wacom Bamboo. Would you recommend it over getting say a Galaxy Note Tablet or a Surface? I've been looking at something to digitize and organize my notes and I'm stuck between a 600 dollar tablet, the Wacom Bamboo, or a smart pen.  Can you use the Bamboo, to write all the notes say in Word or Onenote? Or is it mostly good for inserting figures into existing word documents (like typing notes) and Powerpoint slides? I'd like to be able to hand write all my notes but have the documents searchable by word, is this a possibility?"
biology,3e0af1,Micromeds,2,Tue Jul 21 06:17:46 2015 UTC,"How's your handwriting? If it's decent I say there's a fair shot that Onenote will recognize almost everything you write. I could, for example, type 'aldehyde' in in Onenote right now and find a record of everywhere it's mentioned; in figures, in hand-writing, and in printouts from documents. My notes are almost entirely hand-written.  So yes: It is possible. If you have atrocious handwriting, it's less efficient. One trick around that is to type headings and then write content.  I have noticed that while search-by-word is VERY good, handwriting conversion to text and handwriting to math is less good if you take notes like I do: non-linear and with lots of graphical cues. But I never found a use for those features anyway.  Now, OneNote will do this whether you're using the Bamboo or the Surface or high-end tablet with a digitizer stylus.   If you have an existing laptop, you can pick up a Bamboo for 100$ or less; I have the Capture CTH-700 from a while ago. I bought it on a deal site for 50$. That's a lot lower intro cost to whether or not this style will work for you.   It is less convenient in terms of portability: takes up more space, you need a bit of desk or table, and you have to learn to read the screen while you write on the Wacom. However, you get the additional processing power of a real laptop, and you have the full-fledged keyboard to add in typing notes if the professor is going too quick to write to. I think it's a less fragile solution than a Surface. I also like the size of my screen (14"") which allows me to have a Onenote window and a textbook window open together to take notes from. Or I have my notes and my homework that I'm doing showing up tiled. That's useful.  I'm being provided a Surface for work very soon. If you've still not bought by then I can give you a real comparison.   TLDR: I spent $50 on a Wacom tablet and it was the best thing I ever did for my education."

It's always rough when you just start, I remember it took me a while to get the hang of how to study for Bio tests but here's how I do it and do pretty well. First of all, bring your laptop to class and try your hardest to write down notes on EVERYTHING the prof lectures on/stresses. If he/she uses PowerPoint and uploads them to a site (like blackboard) even better. I go through all of the power points, look at what notes I've written on them and then look up the info on that slide in the textbook. Then I make my own version of notes, either written down or typed, covering everything on the power points with info from the book. Basically, if you look over everything the prof mentions, you will succeed. In short, make notes on what the prof says. Look up your notes/PowerPoint slides in your textbook and write the important info on each topic in a way that's easy for you to understand. This is good for biology based classes, chemistry is a whole other deal. That is just about practicing the problems over and over again"

Advice from one of my professors was to make sure that any study group has A/B students as well as B/C students. This ensures that everyone gets something out of it: the A/B students have to re-word and teach their knowledge, allowing them to ace the exam, and the C/D students finally get to hear the material in a way that makes sense (eventually)."

biology,3e0af1,Orion_4o4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Look over it again and again and again. Try to avoid just memorizing a word/process with a simple sentence definition. Read the material in your textbooks twice over, and them write down what you take from it in your notes. Try and understand it via your own words/thought process instead of memorizing. If you take your initial notes in class, then read the textbook over and write it down again, then study all of your ""perfected notes"", the repetition alone will help. What will get you to an A though is to start this process early and begin studying 4-5 days prior. For example, in my bio class I had tests on Fridays and started reading the textbook and making my ""perfected"" notes/study guide on Monday. This repeated schedule got me to an A. Also on essay questions, write out every damn detail you can think of."

Think of the questions that may be asked and then look for possible questions in the material that would be obviously on there. His helps me to at least set a solid foundation. Then I reviews my notes by myself at first and then had a friend quiz me. Basically, I never stop studying until I can answer every question as if it was fill in the blank. It can be kind of a bitch, but I missed too many questions about a subject that I only kind of knew thanks to the thinking ""oh I'll know it when k see it"".

biology,3e1bk9,c9lam,5,Tue Jul 21 04:55:17 2015 UTC,"We actually already do this. Except that the math goes the other way. As you increase the fertility of the hen, the maximum lifespan of the hen goes down. Way, way down. Producing eggs is energetically costly and physically exhausting. Unlike chickens in the wild, breeds of domesticated hen selected for egglaying capacity lay over three hundred eggs a year for a year, then start to drop off and eventually stop.  This process can be delayed by forcing the hens to moult, completely starving them of food for a week or two, which stops egg production from energy depletion, but allows the reproductive system time to rest, heal, and regenerate. Chickens moult naturally as winter rises, due to daylight shortage and increasing food stress. Stimulating this artifically squeezes a bit of extra life out of chickens.  In the wild, chickens have an average lifespan of 7 years. Domestic chickens reared for fertility have a lifespan of 2 years, of which the second year yields no more eggs laid. These chickens are slaughtered for soup or stock once they stop laying, though."

Just knowing the topology of this network is insufficient to predict what happens to D if you increase A. It's not just whether D will increase or decrease; it could very well be that D increases first, then decreases. And even that depends on how you increase A: did you increase it quickly, or slowly? Did you increase it, then return it to normal (i.e. a temporary pulse of A)?  Biological networks can be far more complicated than that, including feedback loops, many more players, and more conditional logic (e.g. B only works if C is also present).

My professor was able to conclusively show that the carotinoids have two uses... to brightly color feathers AND as critical components for biochemical reactions in the avian immune systems. Birds that were in areas higher in radiation were more dull colored because they were using their carotinoids to repair damage from mutations. Birds with fewer mutations and less exposure to radiation were less bright and therefore were less often selected as mates.

Lets say long, colorful tail feather. Now initially it wasn't as long as peacock feathers are today. Just a tad bit longer. Why did they find it attractive? Because their mothers did. I learned this as the ""sexy sons hypothesis"". Its a positive feedback loop. Female likes long feathers. She will mate with a male with a long feather. Ideally, her sons would inherit their father's long feathers and the daughters inherit their mothers attraction to long feathers. And it continues...and features get exaggerated.

At another level of discourse, we may find that those visual cues are correlated with health, but neither the male nor the female is aware of this.  It's also not necessarily true. If females prefer colorful males with large trains in this generation, then they will probably also prefer them in the next generation, so selection purely for display is likely to lead to increased offspring fitness even if health has nothing to do with it."

On the other hand chimpanzees, whose societies are patriarchal, see all manner of violent behaviour.

Why do male birds of paradise look the way they do? Aren't they more conspicuous that way? Surely this will decrease their fitness as it is easier for predators to spot them. But upon inspection, you realise that sexual selection is a predominant force here, which means that the fitness of male birds of paradise is more dependent on their ability to reproduce than it is on their ability to survive predation.   The sterile casts of eusocial animals (bees, wasps, ants, termites, shrimps and naked mole-rats, etc.) is also counter-intuitive. Even to this day, the evolution of eusociality isn't fully understood. There are some interesting and promising theories, though.   Another example is animal personality, which is my field of study. Some animals are bolder, some are shier. Some explore more, some explore less. Some are more active, some are less active. There's a lot of literature on animal personality, which is most often studied in vertebrates. Some personality traits may appear counter-intuitive from an evolutionary point of view.   Bolder animals take more risks. They venture out farther, they get closer to novel and unknown objects, they get closer to predators. One would assume that boldness would be selected against. Yet bold animals continue to be born, generation after generation. It has been shown that personality is genetic and hereditary. So why is boldness a personality trait that is maintained among populations? This is still a new field of study: the evolutionary processes behind animal personality. Boldness may be maintained via sexual selection, or frequency-depend selection, mutation-selection balance, etc.   So I guess there's a lot a examples of traits that seem counter-intuitive from an evolutionary perspective!"

biology,3dsxt0,purple_potatoes,21,Sun Jul 19 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Something like this. There's such a thing as a ""healthy"" amount of oil on your skin because it's supposed to be a natural barrier against water-borne pathogens. Typically when you wash your face with soap, you're removing the a good amount of this natural oil and also opening up your pores because you probably used hot water to activate the soap. This means you now have wide open pores and no natural defensive oils on your skin, meaning bacteria can move in more easily. This can lead to break-outs.   To prevent this from happening, use a less-intense soap (various companies make some less bubbly soap bars that might feel/smell weird but are designed to not remove so much oil), and also wash your face with COLD water after you scrub to close your pores again. If you can, while your at work/school, just wash your face with a tiny amount of soap and some cold water in the middle of the day. The idea is that you want to wash your face more often but less abrasively, so that your body doesn't go into oil-production overdrive because you keep periodically removing all of your natural oil, since too much oil can block the sebaceous glands and ALSO lead to breakouts. Find a balance that works for you.   Also, there's other general acne advice like changing your pillowcase more often; if you put your face on the same piece of fabric every night, it's eventually going to get pretty gross."

biology,3dq9ia,Kenyan_Wholey,17,Sat Jul 18 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, angler here that can hopefully help yeah out. As a side note, I am an at-risk youth counselor so I admire the work you are doin' out there, and keep at it. Also note, my advice is from the perspective of an angler (albeit a very serious one). Hopefully a biologist will be able to help better on the technicalities.  For starters, I am assuming that you have these generational issues, due to the adults eating the fry. In looking at the size of the pond, I for one would want to have more water available overall for each generation, and from the looks of things that may be possible. I would simply build a similar sized pond further down the hill, and dam the one up top. This way, and with a proper ""grill"" covering the dam outlet, you would be able to use your original pond for the larger guys, and the smaller ones would go through the grill, and down to the smaller pond.  Also, what is their food source? As a general rule, underwater plant growth breeds food sources such as phytoplankton, which in turn is eaten by ""bait fish"". These tiny fish in turn, are eaten by bigger fish, such as your telapia's. From what I see in the photo, it looks like poor conditions that they are living in. Now, if you could provide contrast in the environment (ie: overhanging shade plants or more aquatic vegetation) the fingerlings will do much better at surviving before being flushed out to your new pond down the hill as they now have places to hide.  The idea you have of a separate tub for the fingerlings has merit, but you would need to take a lot of precautions. For one, that tub will heat up a LOT in Kenya. You would need to have it in an area not only out of the sun, but monitored a lot for pH and oxygen fluctuations. If you get out of life supporting specs, you now have a whole generation of dead fish. One simple algae bloom build up without close monitoring (as well as a way to reduce the algae bloom) will be disaster.  So yeah, if you could get some pond liner, and some basic tools and hard work, you could have a pretty sweet system. I have to state again though, that is the ""fish biology for dummies"" response, hopefully a more qualified fish nerd will chime in. Best of luck!!!  EDIT: Oh! Don't just start planting a bunch of plants in the pond, as that too can fluctuate your oxygen levels really bad. Again, something you would need input from a biologist."

(It has been an extremely long day and I apologize in advance for any typos, grammatical errors, or incomplete thoughts.)  Now to the issue at hand: There are many constraints that we have to deal with to make a multi-generational system feasible:  The first and biggest one is cost. Due to the fact that we dedicate a majority of our funds to feed, house, clothe, pay school tuition, etc for 30+ children, makes any attempt at creating a new pond impossible. On top of that there is a space limitation that will not allow us to build another pond of this size(or any pond of that matter). We have gone through several generations already with an acceptable yield. Although I would agree that more shade and better oxidation could be achieved. We are in Kenya where there is a large amount of rain and we have 2 separate pumps that allow us to add water when the level drops below the acceptable amount(water level and oxidation are not 'top of mind priorities').  To continue my original thought process, the idea of re-purposing a water storage tank and dig it into the ground(reduce the amount of heat/sunlight that the tank would be exposed to, and the amount of land it would take up) along with some shade(next to a tree/bush/w.e.) and add some air stones. Is this a feasible idea or not?  Being in rural Kenya we have very limited resources at our disposal, but there are several water tanks that are sold at the local markets(http://toptank.com/shop/tanks/standard-cylindrical-storage-tank/) are the most common of the bunch. With this in mind if there is a best practice for breeding fry and fingerlings in a re-purposed water tank say 200L-500L?  The idea of aquaculture has come across my mind but we have a large enough farm where anymore veg would become extra work, and that is not what we are looking for(although a good idea)  We are around 80% self sustaining with a decent sized farm for our needs that includes 2 cows, 30+chickens, several goats and sheep. When it comes to what the fish eat the current method that has worked best is to take a 10kg sack of chicken manure and perforate it so that maggots form and then place it into a corner of the pond. Again, there are better methods to feed fish but due to monetary constrains we have found this to be the best solution.  Simply put if there is a way to take an existing tank and be able to breed fry and fingerlings to then be able to release them into the large pond?

biology,3dq9ia,SpeedWeasel,2,Sat Jul 18 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"Although this is slightly unrelated to your current problem, have you thought about turning your current setup into an Aquaponics farm? This combines a fish farm, like the one you already have with a hydroponics farm which is basically a water based plant farm. It's a nice system because the bacteria which grow around the plant roots will filter out all of the ammonia you get from the fish feces and turn it into plant nutrients. This way your fish don't get poisoned by the ammonia and you don't have to clean the water manually all the time.   An Aquaponics system is pretty easy to make (I worked on a project that built one in Brazil with Talapia) but would require you to buy a pump and a large plastic box for the plants."
biology,3dq9ia,AddictivePotential,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"What a great project! Fortunately there are many, many resources for aquaculture/breeding tilapia for a food source. Google ""tilapia aquaculture"" and dozens of how-to sites come up.   I don't think anyone here can type one comment on everything you need to know. You need to know the ins and outs of water quality, tilapia maturity rates, tilapia requirements, filter systems, ponds, basic construction, etc. It isn't just what the fish need, but also the best way to construct the entire aquaculture system. I think you would have more success reaching out to a non-profit that does aquaculture in a climate similar to yours and have them help you.   You can use that pond and just separate it into two parts, you'll have 2 harvests of tilapia but of course the harvests will be 1/2 the size.  Can you buy plastic tarps? I would do that before buying a water tank. Dig and make a smaller pool in the room you have next to the original pond.   They do need aeration (air pump) and an open top is practical for feeding, catching, counting, etc. So they aren't like plants in that they need sunlight, but putting them in a sealed water drum is a no-go.  Also aquaculture = exactly what you are doing  aquaponics = with plants. people are suggesting aquaponics because the plants eat up the fish poop and turn it into lush foliage. It's basically a natural filter. When you have live plants the water quality becomes better and easier to manage. I literally do not have to do water changes in my 10gal aquarium because it's jammed with aquatic plants.  As far as the size of the pools, you need to do those calculations yourself. It depends on how many lbs of fish you want to harvest and how much fish food & freshwater you have access to. Again, all the aquaculture sites will have those calculations and tell you how many litres per fish, etc."

If you want to ""clean"" the sample for diatoms, you can put some of your sample in like a 50% bleach solution for a few days, then a few days of waiting for everything to settle (white powder at the bottom of a cup while you pour off the bleach and refill with fresh water. So settle --> pour --> add water --> repeat. They you should be able to look at the diatoms at 400x or higher and see lots of good detail.

biology,3dkfgx,tchomptchomp,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Right. No, I'm aware of that. The problem is that a lot of these dates are built upon fossil calibrations that are tenuous at best. While there are a lot of methodological problems with molecular clocks, the fossil calibration point problem is the most glaring. This is especially problematic for calibrations in deep time, such as the amphibian-amniote split, the ray-finned fish-tetrapod split, and the bony fish-cartilaginous fish split.   There's also a second problem, which is that some molecular clock studies are often more accurate than others, in part because they use better models and in part because they use multiple calibrations, allow phylogenetic uncertainty, etc. So in the case of the cat-human example, yes, some studies have placed this divergence as far back as 120 Ma to even 160 Ma, more specific models have been recovering a younger and younger age, to the extent that it seems the cat-human divergence may be right around 65-70 Ma (which is more or less in line with what the fossil record says). Similar things are happening in other major groups as well (e.g. birds), with key divergences moving more and more shallow (and more and more in line with the fossil record, incidentally) as more and more data (and better models, calibrations, etc) are thrown at the problem.  These are more problems with the whole cottage industry of molecular clock studies than any specific site, but it's something to be aware of."

If you set up a kiddie pool outside with regular tap water the chlorine will offgas and leave a perfectly good pool of water for plants and animals to inhabit. You will quickly see phytoplankton (free-floating algae) and periphyton (attached algae) in the pool, giving it a cloudy appearance. Then you will see aquatic insects , usually beetles feeding on larval insects that were oviposited (usually mosquitoes and midges). If you are close enough to natural water you will even see zooplankton come in and clear out all the phytoplankton. They can be carried in by the wind or even on birds and insects. If you are real lucky, depending on where you live, frogs and toads will come lay eggs in the pool.

biology,3dhzu3,DaveyBaby27,9,Thu Jul 16 12:50:47 2015 UTC,"Was on admissions once for grad programs. Some things to consider:  Grades and GRE can't help, only hurt. Keep a >3.2 and stay top 50 percentile or higher. Other than that, no one cares you have a 4.0. Seriously. No one.   The single most important thing are your research experience (as reflected in your personal statement and any publications you have) and a letter of rec from your research advisor to back it up. Honestly, if you have a wishy-washy letter of rec from your masters thesis advisor, your application is dead in the water. If you haven't picked a mentor yet, find ( ask around) someone that fights for their students. We want to see that you were involved in the design of projects and that you did more than ""tech"" work. I.e. you contributed intellectually - the intellectual worth of the project would be lesser if you weren't involved. A strong letter(s) of support, a publication, and a well written personal essay is what separates third tier from top 20.  Also consider a Masters is really only advisable if you're currently abroad the U.S.  Your masters degree will likely not count towards PhD (maybe a class or two, if you're lucky) and you'll likely graduate at the same pace as fresh US citizen bachelors entering the same PhD program. If you're in the U.S., you're better off doing a paid tech job for a couple years with a PI that has a track record of involving techs in projects (I.e. Getting you a publication or two).

biology,3dhzu3,FussyParts,6,Thu Jul 16 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"Your most recent GPA trumps undergraduate transcripts. It depends how bad is bad. If you have a 3.5 GPA at your Masters and write something to the extent of ""I had personal issues (or whatever), which I've clearly overcome, as is evidence by my recent transcript and lab work"", and your PI writes that you're doing well, then you'll be fine. Maybe Harvard will look down on that, but no one actually wants to go there. We overlook a 2.5 or less on an undergraduate transcript if you have a 3.2-3.5 or higher on your current, plus research experience. Everyone is allowed mistakes, but you have to prove you've learned from them.  What I would personally recommend: you could tech somewhere and audit courses for credit (which might be free or severely discounted if you're a university employee). It wouldn't get you a Masters diploma, but financially it's a no-braininer (~$150k swing over two years). If you're going for a PhD anyways, a Masters diploma is useless. In fact, many Masters programs are being seen as mills for pre-med students who want to bolster their grades when reapplying to med schools (i.e. The overall value of many [not all] Masters programs is dropping, in my opinion). As a tech, you would gain lab experience while retaking courses to show you're serious. All while earning a paycheck and learning different fields, which you can write off as you gaining valuable experience learning techniques and what things you're interested in studying. This would also give you a rapport with your letter-of-rec-writing PI from day 1, as opposed to however long it takes to find a lab as a Masters student.  There are plenty of applicants that go from ~2.0 GPA (or worse) to desirable and successful candidates in a couple years. Definitely not impossible, but you'll have to work hard to prove yourself. P.S. if you're a minority there are ample programs, which pay stipends, to do exactly this."

""I spent my Junior year asking X, we designed experiments A, B, and C, to test this hypothesis, these were the results and our interpretation is such"". In an interview they'll ask basic stuff like, what else could you do, what other interpretations are there, how does this experiment work, etc.  If for some reason you don't get into a grad program of your choice, and that's what you really, really want, being a lab tech for a year or two is a perfectly viable option. About half of my class cam straight from bachelors, and half came from lab tech or similar."

biology,3dhzu3,Geothrix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:36 2015 UTC,pretty simple if you finish your master's work in a timely fashion and publish your thesis.
biology,3dhzu3,Smeghead333,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"It's really not hard to get into a PhD grad program.  There are tons out there, and they all need students.  It may be tougher to get into a specific PhD program that you might have your heart set on, but just about anyone can get into some program somewhere.  I agree that a Master's is mostly a waste of time if you're in the US.  I'm doing my PhD at an Ivy League university, and we had a rotation student that couldn't multiply or divide by ten without writing the numbers down first.  She didn't last.  But she got in!"

biology,3dkznt,rematch728,5,Fri Jul 17 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"The same exact thing happened to me with chemistry -- all it really takes is one bad teacher sometimes, and it can change all your feelings about a subject (and I still never really recovered, haha). I got hooked on biology because of another teacher, though. His passion and genuine excitement for the subject was undoubtedly infectious, and lead me to pursue a major in biology. I implore you to find the same kind of excitement, even if it's from something a bit silly.   Keep in mind, though, that it's not for everyone and you don't have to like it, so don't give yourself a hard time if it's not your thing! Good luck."
biology,3dkznt,TheEmbernova,3,Fri Jul 17 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"Try taking a top down approach where you read broadly at the general interest level on biological topics until you find something interesting. Lots of good, accessible books out there, The Emperor of All Maladies, The Hot Zone, etc. OK yeah, don't necessarily believe or accept everything you read if you take the path of ""The Hot Zone"" and related books; do due diligence and fact check. That alone should get you hooked into learning more of the fundamentals.  Sometimes you gotta find something that really wows you before you can become convinced you want to delve deeper into it to understand what really makes it tick."
biology,3dkznt,cbf88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to inspire an interest, take a walk in the woods.  Why is that tree there?, mosquitoes:  why are they biting you (answer:  Life is rough for aquatic insects, they get out of the water as soon as possible so they don't get eaten.  As a result, no fat reserves for eggs).  Why is the stream clear in the forest, and silty in cleared land?  Why do I see squirrels and birds, and a few dear, but no big predators?  Walk in the woods (or go fishing, or anything in nature), start asking questions and finding the answers.  That is how most of the old school biologists got started."
biology,3dkznt,CharlesInVT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:30 2015 UTC,"This is such a nice post. But I want an answer why I dont see any big predators? I live in Canada and I see dear, squirrels, skunks, rabbits frequently, rarely I see bears, why?"
biology,3dkznt,frostmasterx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:44:04 2015 UTC,"Answering that would be cheating.  Here is a hint, however, look up energy pyramids and the rule of 10.  Think about what predators eat and where their food gets its food."
biology,3dkznt,CharlesInVT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:05:36 2015 UTC,"I was reading Chromosome 6 by Robin Cook when I was in high school and it really got me hooked on the molecular biology / genetic side of biology. I'm sure not everything in the book was sound science but just the thought of what could be possible and how the stuff at that scale works really did it for me. And as /u/CharlesInVT pointed just walking around and wondering how things work and looking them up is a really good way to start. The thing is is not to get overwhelmed when you look something and it is complex, just look at the big picture in what is happening (i.e.photosynthesis: Light+CO2+H20 --> Sugar+O2+H2O) then you can start going deeper and find out how all that happens and what takes place in the cell (i.e. reaction centers, ferrodoxin, light vs. dark reactions, gradients, thylakoids etc). That goes for everything. Just give it time and find what you enjoy and the rest will come."

biology,3dirbr,gockets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"molluscs and chordates are pretty far apart.  I would think your best bet is an introductory biology book.  I mean molluscs are protostomes and lophotrochozoans, and chordates are deuterostomes.  Their most recent common ancestor is a rather undefined bilateria.    http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/361/flashcards/1226361/png/animal_phyla1329961122731.png  They picture a whale, but hey, that's just a fish that breathes air (and evolved from land dwelling walking fish that nursed its young and had hair. . . )"
