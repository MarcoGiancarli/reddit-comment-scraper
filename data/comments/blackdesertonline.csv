blackdesertonline,3e4ut4,Midna_,2,Tue Jul 21 23:40:49 2015 UTC,Go to Northern Wheat Plantation (small village north-east of Calpheon) and buy an item called Ale (something something) from the trade NPC. Bring it to that guy. Just remember to have it in your inventory and not horsebag when you deliver it

blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,Ali_san,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for translating. Too bad Inven didn't ask important questions like ""Will there be new gear at release?"" ""Will we get new skills or expansions to existing ones with the increased softcap?"". Well, we will find out soon anyway :)"
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,LuckyFennec,3,Tue Jul 21 08:58:16 2015 UTC,Are you looking for a new Warrior skills teaser?  PS. Hope your holiday is going well! Come back already. xD

You're so mean xD  Yeah holiday is nice. I'm here in the mountains and really enjoying the fresh air :P in the city it's just too hot. Will be back on 3rd august approx... too late :("
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,kjjeon5204,2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:49 2015 UTC,That is evil lol!
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,Ali_san,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"Um...it was answered but the translator stopped before that portion. There will be new gear on release however, it won't be more powerful than the one's that are currently in game. Also, there will be no new skills added."
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,ValthierRS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:56 2015 UTC,Damn you Kinto... haha  Thanks for informing me man. Maybe they meant not more powerful than Bossarmor. So disappointed that there are no new skills u.u
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,Ali_san,2,Tue Jul 21 22:00:52 2015 UTC,I personally don't want stronger equipment-- just different for different builds/playstyles. That's just my opinion though. I don't like when older gear becomes irrelevant with a new update.
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,fweepa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"I partially agree with you. The thing is though, when they nerfed Evasion on Tarotus etc. (or the stat itself rather) some ppl went full Neil trees for more dmg, HP and gem slots.  I personally, would love to have a boss weapon like Zaka with +3 attackspeed and crit or something useful for Warriors :)"
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,Ali_san,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"They said they would be able to focus on game balancing content after Valencia, so that'll be interesting to see upcoming patches after this big release."
blackdesertonline,3e1nuk,fweepa,2,Wed Jul 22 01:01:44 2015 UTC,Very curious about that! Hope they hold their promise x) Sometimes things change for the worse so let's keep our fingers crossed.

blackdesertonline,3e390h,Devoire,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Currently there is no Pearl Abyss or Daum affiliated websites for the NA or EU versions of Black Desert.

blackdesertonline,3e2fjd,Veishi,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:23 2015 UTC,"You can continue no matter what.  Extraction should destroy the sword and give you a regular stone back in place of the otherwise useless quest one you used to enchant the worthless quest weapon.  It exists merely to teach you the process of removing stones from a weapon and having the weapon destroyed.  All the items are total garbage in the big picture, so there is no need to fret.  They are merely teaching tools.  The tutorial bath tier/basteer/bass tier weapon class only seems ""better"" because you don't know about enchanting the regular weapons well yet.  Those are dead end teaching weapons that can't be fully enchanted nor can they be upgraded green->blue->yellow.  TL;DR don't worry it's all worthless stuff, just practice for when you get past the first 50 tutorial levels and into real gameplay.  Finishing the quest has no bearing on unlocking any new quests, so feel free to abandon it if you are truly trapped."
blackdesertonline,3e2fjd,Balmeri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:40:20 2015 UTC,I do understand all of that currently actually since I do have two level 50 chars lol. And I didn't do the extraction quest for the sword and now the black spirit just constantly bugs the ever living hell outta me and never has any quest even when I talk to the blacksmith. The blacksmith has nothing either.
blackdesertonline,3e2fjd,Jastarino,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:28 2015 UTC,Did you have the quest that asks you to extract it? If so then you may need to hand the quest in at the Delpa Knight Castle blacksmith.
blackdesertonline,3e356r,EKEEFE41,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:59 2015 UTC,The dagger gives you added dmg on your page. And your assesory can be upgraded by putting it with the exact piece in the enchanting bar. But has a low chance of enchanting succes. Better off buying those of auction. Bar les gives you dmg and talis gives you raw def.

You can look them up here, if you want them for your sheet on gdocs just say so you'll get a copy.  http://www.bdotome.com/forums/index.php?/topic/31-full-translation-of-kunoichi-female-ninja-skills/"

blackdesertonline,3e18ww,Aeimy,2,Wed Jul 22 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hey Aeimy, I took at look at your translations and there's a few improvements that could be made. Such as ""After using Shadowstep Right Click or Register in skill slot"" would be ""After using Shadowstep Right Click or activate its skill slot"" to have a more accurate translation. Other than that stuff it looks great though. I'll just copy/paste the translation into my Google Doc and modify them the rest of the way there. I did notice you referenced the class as the 'Female Ninja' as well. This however is not true. The Female Ninja and the Kunoichi are two separate classes with their own attributes, skill sets, ect. I'm not entirely sure why the Female Ninja class was also created now as the Kunoichi has been planned since the start of Alpha 1 while the Female Ninja is a recent addition. Thanks for the work on the translations though, I'll be sure to edit in your name on the posts once I finish updating the document."
blackdesertonline,3e18ww,Aeimy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"Hey Xennma yeah we can edit that no problem. INTERESTING about two separate classes wth.. could it possibly be somehow connect to this quote from a very recent interview in inven?  ""Q: Black Desert has a good reputation in Japan. Is the Kunoichi aimed for the Japanese market?  A: It would be difficult to view this character as a planned character for the Japanese market. The Kunoichi was a character that was previously planned for specifically Japan. In spite of that, Kunoichi will first go live on the Korean version before Japan to meet the needs of players who desired an assassin type character instead of aiming for a particular market.""  Edit: Credit goes also to Kinto :3"

The Female Ninja and the Kunoichi are two separate classes with their own attributes, skill sets, ect.   Ah yeah sorry, I came to that assumption due to this image which states 'New Character: Female Ninja' at the top. If there really is two separate classes, then that's really weird on Pearl Abyss/Daum's part to have two classes that use the same weapons and essentially the same name.  We will get it changed though and thanks a bunch for all the information and data =)!"
blackdesertonline,3e18ww,AmbientXVII,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"I've finished updating the document with your translations.  Here is a link to a slightly earlier dump I did that contains a couple of strings not present in this dump:   http://pastebin.com/fbDkpin8  As for a quick overview of the classes and their id's here is a list of screenshots to provide a bit of insight to what currently exists on the main public KR version of BD:  http://imgur.com/a/kEO3K  There are other things that could help show differences between the two as being different classes, but I feel this is the quickest and easiest way to show it.  As always keep in mind this information could always be changed from now and release."
blackdesertonline,3e18ww,AmbientXVII,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe Kunoichi is just an old string, since Count is there along with Wizard.  Unless Count is a separate class as well?"
