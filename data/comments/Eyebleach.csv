However they had fierce playoff series in 2010 and 2012. They also fought many hard battles in the late 90's and early 2000's.   Former Devils defenceman Scott Stevens also laid a notorious hit on Flyers forward Eric Lindros. At the time it was clean hit, however more recent rules have made it look much more dirty. Stevens his Lindros in the head with his elbow, giving Lindros a terrible Concussion. Lindros was never the same player again and bounced around the NHL from 2002 -2007."

I know accidents happen, but keeping elbows out of tackles is not hard at all.   Edit:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVeqzYgTELk   Yeah, that is not a tackle. It's a clear elbow punch into the face and it's definitely not accidental - Stevens lifts his elbow in preparation. There's no argument for that being clean, and hits like that have always been punishable. This particular one is fucking nasty."

Eyebleach,3dvxq2,CaveJohnsonOfficial,5,Mon Jul 20 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"It's actually not that bad. I grew up watching Mister Rogers' Neighbourhood and I've seen quite a bit of Daniel Tiger's Neighbourhood.  It's almost exactly as mellow and, aside from being animated and a bit more simple for the kids, is pretty obviously being kept close to what Mister Rogers' was. Which is good as it's based on Mister Rogers!  There's no disputing it's a new show and is taking new conventions and doing a few new things. It's also weird that Daniel doesn't wear any pants when pretty much everyone else does. It's not anywhere near as bad as other children's shows I've had the misfortune of watching, though. Like Caillou.  Fuck you, Caillou. I'll see you in hell you little fucking bastard."
Eyebleach,3dvxq2,Ayyno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"...You and me must be the polar opposite. I ADORED Caillou as a child, still respect it today, especially the original with the felt puppets. I dislike Daniel Tiger because, tho it is mellow and calm like you said, it's nowhere near as mellow. It still feels all jumpy and all over the place like the other shows I'm forced to watch. I can see where you are coming from, it does maintain a little of the heart behind it, but it really feels like a cash grab more than an actual modern day adaptation of the show.  Embarrassed as I am to say it, I've gotten exposed to a lot of these kids shows because I'm forced to watch them with the little guy, and there are some shows that got modern day adaptations REALLY well. Bob the Builder is a good example."
Eyebleach,3dvxq2,davidabeats,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"I'm more talking about current Caillou. Where he's bald for pretty much no reason other than the character was so bland in the first place that if you put hair on him he'd be, apparently, unrecognizable. From the static, washed-out-on-the-sides still background pieces to the robotic way Caillou's parents are portrayed the show just reeks of crap to me.  Caillou is bratty, whiny, and at times just plain horrible. His sister, though she adores him, is treated like shit. His parents are emotionless robots who never get angry or yell, never really do anything other than serve as some unobtainable model of parenting a demon child from the bowels of Hades.  Caillou gets a lot of hate because no matter what he is always whiny and just rather annoying. Many of my friends that have kids refuse to let their children watch Caillou just because they don't want to encourage the shitty, whiny behaviour he has.  The original with the felt puppets? The REAL Caillou before he was abducted by really annoying aliens and replaced with a gangly bald menace? That Caillou is good shit. I used to watch that as a kid as well.  Personally, though, I really just miss the days of The Magic Schoolbus. Ms. Frizzle is the shit and I swear to all of the gods that show is the reason I love science, technology, and all sorts of other shit today.  TL;DR - Modern Caillou is lazy, bald shit. Art and animation is fucked up and lazy and he's such a bad role model for kids, IMHO. Old-school Caillou (PUPPETS!) is good shit. I appreciate it a lot more and I used to watch it as a kid. Ms. Frizzle is the real shit, though. The Magic School bus is one of the best shows ever.  I guess my point is that I really just miss old kid's shows. They seemed a lot more focused on teaching lessons and left most of the parenting up to the folks setting us in front of the TV in the first place. Bill Nye? Right? RIGHT?!"
Eyebleach,3dvxq2,Ayyno,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"I will admit that new Caillou is pretty much an emasculated version of the old. I guess I was sort of blind to it because I watched nearly every episode of the old. But you are right, new Caillou doesn't match up to the old.  I watched a few episodes of Magic School Bus as a kid, but I never had a chance because we didn't have a lot of channels when I was a kid. And yes, I love Bill Nye, then and now. I actually watched a lot more of him than Magic School Bus. I might even have a VHS tape of him. God, those were the old days..."

Eyebleach,3ds4j3,csj_,6,Sun Jul 19 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"Please don't do this to your kids though.  If you stage one of these ""daddy suddenly shows up"" events then your kid learns ""daddy sometimes comes and goes without telling anyone. I could go to sleep and he might not be here when I wake.""  Your kid isn't too young to be kept informed ""daddy's home next week, daddy's home on Thursday, daddy's home today, here's day and he's here to stay.""  I went OS for work for ten days when my kids were those ages and they still remember it now about five years later. And that was just ten days and I was staying in a nice big safe hotel and we Skyped every day - can't imagine how stressful it is for your kids. Or you.  All the best. Unsolicited advice ends here"
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,evilbrent,25,Sun Jul 19 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's how these typically work. It's more like they'll tell the kids ""dad is coming home Thursday"", then he surprises them on Tuesday. Also, military families always tell their kids when mom or dad is deploying. Kids don't just wake up to find out a parent is gone for the next 6 months."
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,NoBudgetBallin,0,Sun Jul 19 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah I get that.   The article I read said that it's the suddenly-showing-up that leads to the fear of might-suddenly-vanish.

It's hard enough for a little kid to cope with the stress of a reunion if they know exactly when it's coming and they have their support network in place.  Those are real tears. That poor girl is literally overwhelmed with emotions that she probably doesn't understand, and will take her a long time to get her head around.  I'm not saying she shouldn't cry when it happens, of course you would, that's healthy and great. But definitely don't spring it on them"

Eyebleach,3ds4j3,NanykYelrevelc,7,Sun Jul 19 06:34:09 2015 UTC,How do these things usually work? Does he have to go back to active duty or is he back home for good?
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,Paging_Dr_Chloroform,28,Sun Jul 19 06:35:50 2015 UTC,"Usually when a soldier comes back from deployment they get a few weeks of leave, meaning they don't have to go to work until it's up. This is time to spend with family and get used to not being on a ship or in a war zone for eight months. The amount of leave is by branch, AFAIK. Officers probably get more leave than Enlisted.  From the video it says he's a Marine Gunnery Sergeant, meaning he's Enlisted. Gunnery Sergeant is still a high rank so he might get more leave than a Private. An actual Marine ought to correct me if I'm wrong though.   In short, you get a few weeks to spend with your family until you go back to work. You don't get actually deployed again for a few years, but after leave is up you go back to your job, whatever it may be. Think of it like paid vacation."
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,NinjaDerpy,17,Sun Jul 19 06:49:10 2015 UTC,"Leave is awarded the same amount no matter the rank, 2.5 days per month plus 20? (I should know this, but I can't remember exactly off the top of my head right now) days off work with partial leave upon return to home station where you can take regular leave after the uncharged leave or after the off-duty time is over. Mind you I'm in the air force so our leave regs might be different, but they should be fairly similar military wide."
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,newt02,-20,Sun Jul 19 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"Gonna be the bearer of obvious news nobody wants to hear, but if you wanted your kids to have time with their father, he shouldn't have joined the army/military/navy/whatever.  It's not like you join and then SURPRISE! It's a military secret and you're just finding out, but you're gonna be away for a long time, all the time! This is stuff you know beforehand. This is a choice your husband made. If he didn't want the consequences of that choice, he should not have made it.  Everyone wants sympathy for the children of military parents, but the parents don't deserve it. Don't have kids if you're in the army. Don't join the army if you have kids. Two simple concepts that daddy failed to follow and his kids now suffer for it and there's nobody else to blame.  I don't have sympathy for them because their parents are military/marines/whatever. I have sympathy for them because their parents made bad parenting decisions, such as taking a job that causes them suffering."

Eyebleach,3ds4j3,FinalMantasyX,2,Sun Jul 19 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"It'd be logical if it was correct, but it isn't. She isn't taking issue with the fact that he's away for long periods of time, she's taking issue with the fact that he isn't being allowed to take the leave he has accrued. That's entirely different, and the latter isn't a ""reality of the military"", it's poor planning and management on the behalf of whoever is in charge of scheduling leave."

Since he's going to a desk job for his next deployment he'll be around for his kids, the problem is his lack of actual holidays."
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,Lizi_Jane,7,Sun Jul 19 22:51:12 2015 UTC,Wow. How astute. I bet she had no idea the military was keeping her husband away from their kids! You must be a great problem solver! You should apply that massive intelect to solving all the worlds problems!  Fucking cunt.
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,QuiteKid,-6,Sun Jul 19 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to solve the problem. I'm trying to make the point that there's no one to blame but this family that made these choices.   If dad went away for months on business, would he be a tragic hero, or a dad with messed up priorities?  If dad was stuck in jail, would his return make him a YouTube famous video, or would people be upset that he chose to leave his children for months at a time?   Hell, if he just LEFT for months... Would people be happy to see a video of his surprise return?   No?   Then how on earth is this different?"
Eyebleach,3ds4j3,FinalMantasyX,9,Sun Jul 19 16:00:40 2015 UTC,"How in the fuck do you feel the right to pass blame on them? Do you think you provided any new information? Do you think she had no clue what marrying into the military meant? Did she do anything other than stating rather dryly the leave that her husband has been given?  You are a bully who saw an opportunity to state the obvious and lord yourself above someone who was completely aware of their personal situation. That keyboard warrior bullshit won't cut it in the real world.   You're gonna sleep in the bed you make, probably alone. Fuck off shithead."

The friend I was talking about went in as a private.  He did not want to join, but because he has a baby on the way and no good job experience, he joined.  I just think it is a tough decision to make when you are starting a family. I have been with my now husband for 5 years now and most of it has been spent apart from each other while he was stationed 5 hours away and deployed 2 times.  I'm just agreeing on the post above my comment. When you are enlisted with children, everyone is going to suffer."

I haven't actually had one in around eight months. It is surprising at how much you can do with your phone and the right browsers.   It also helps that I've been first world poor and a computer is fairly low on my list of priorities. Filling out some job applications take awhile because of the tiny screen and scrolling back n forth, but you make do with what you have.   I would buy a cheap netbook, but to me it is illogical. If I had a computer I'd want to play games, buying a $200 computer would only make my life slightly better, and would be $200 that I don't have to buy myself something I'd get both benefits and happiness from."

I was 6 and all I knew was that soldiers are an omnipresent being that will never die and merely retire and become mortal. If I had a puppy die or a relative, perhaps the shocking rush of reality might have hit me earlier. But, once again, I was 6 with no prior experience of evil and all I knew was that my best friend was gone for some reason and I missed him.  If I knew then what situation he was in, I would be horrified. My dad is a Retired Major. He was posted on a base that got subjected to a relatively large rocket attack. He had to deal with both the locals and the American casualties. He's told me stories of our guys that had suffered head trauma and had to be restrained due to hallucinations. Once, a woman and her infant came in with severe burns after her husband poured scalding hot water onto them. For some strange reason, the husband was allowed to come see them in treatment and ended up attacking the woman who would later die in that same bed. Of course, the man was escorted off the base, but they had to return the baby to him once it was better (there just so happened to be a neonatologist deployed with them).  Ignorance is bliss, I guess."

If Africa was the cradle of humanity, we are the kids that left, knowing that their hometown would never change, and made something much better in the process.  Africa has thousands of years of a headstart on the entire world, yet it's still a shithole EXCEPT for the parts that Arabs and Europeans influenced, and the parts that Europeans influenced did a hell of a lot better.   That is, until Mugabe decided to steal the land from them... now we're seeing reports on how much of an absolute fucking disaster that was, that the people Mugabe decided to give the farms to had no fucking clue what they were doing, and are talking noe about returning the land to the previous (white) owners.

Eyebleach,3ds4j3,DXGypsy,3,Sun Jul 19 03:34:32 2015 UTC,"You specifically said, ""the average American doesn't comprehend the death toll of conflicts."" Then you listed foreign conflicts.

Eyebleach,3dq8vd,esk_209,0,Sat Jul 18 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"Why downvote it? I understand that you don't care for it, but it's not off-topic to the subreddit, and since this isn't a vegetarian/vegan/PETA subreddit, it's not really offensive or tasteless either.  /r/Eyebleach, /r/aww, and similar subreddits are, by their very nature subjective, but for most pictures it's easy to see why, while you might not think it's adorable, other reasonable people might (I'm not saying that you're not reasonable, just that it would be understandable for a reasonable person to like it. Just as it's understandable for a reasonable person to not like it. And I can't do any more verbal gymnastics around that :-).      I realize that a good portion of the reddit community ignores reddiquette and used the downvote as a way of disagreeing (rather than using it to push down off-topic posts), but in a sub that is dedicated to giving folks something to take their minds off of the ugliness out there, down voting something that you simply don't care for seems mean spirited."
Eyebleach,3dq8vd,mind-sailor,0,Sat Jul 18 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"Because I come to eyebleach - to put it in your phrasing - to take my mind off of the ugliness out there, and this image did the exact opposite, it reminded me of a reality I see as absolutely horrible ( boiling creatures alive ). Now you might argue that I'm just weird in thinking that boiling animals alive is horrible, but really where I come from about 10% of the population will totally agree with me, so it's not so weird, it's just maybe an unpopular opinion on reddit."

I don't cook them, I don't eat them, and most people I know who do eat them, kill them before putting them in the water.) I wasn't arguing with you, I was asking why you downvoted a post that isn't off-topic to the subreddit when it's just as easy (honestly, easier) to skip it and move on to the next one.  Instead, you downvoted and then voluntarily spent more time in a thread that upset you in order to apologize for downvoting it.  Apologizing implies that you're sorry for doing it, but if you were actually sorry for downvoting it, you didn't have to downvote it (or you could correct it by undownvoting it) instead of using the picture as a jumping-off point for an animal rights lecture."

If the typical person who lived over 70-80 years was still happy, we would have a stereotype of dancing, happy elderly people, not the sad, depressed, angry old guy/woman.   Life after 80 is battling to accept societal changes of nearly a century while watching as your progeny dumps you into a dark room at the end of the piss-soaked hall of your local rest home, while fighting over who gets the only things you have left to show the world what an amazing journey you've taken over the last near-century.   A partial effort is given 5-times a year to force your grandchildren---who only really know you as the decrepit old person who thinks $10 in a birthday card is enough to impress them---to visit you.   Life becomes a drugged-up blur as you start having trouble remembering things more and more, and you start forgetting the names of everyone you've ever loved.   You start getting the baby-voice from your only living relatives, who now visit only on Christmas, as they start making plans for selling your home..  Days have become a blur, and nobody answers your phone calls...  And yesterday they moved you to a new wing in the home, the one behind the key-coded doors...   Eventually you slip away, a sad, confused, lonely individual who has lived the last 6 months as one, repeating day..."

My mother is 61, same thing.   You're elderly when you need help with daily life. As I get older, I become more and more excited about my age and about life. I may not have a full bank account, just buying a house, now at 31 and not where I am when you were my age, but to be respected... to have so much life at your age.. Not something I'm dreading, something I'm welcoming.   You're not elderly. You're just older than me."

Eyebleach,3dhzxl,Woahzie,-7,Fri Jul 17 09:49:18 2015 UTC,I've noticed the saggy boobs on a lot of older women lately.  Do y'all think it would feel better to have boobs removed after a certain age because of general inconvenience? It seems like the weight looks uncomfortable and just managing at that stage seems tedious.   Then I think about an older woman's healing process and if that would actually be ok - older people have thinner skin and healing from surgery can create its own dangers...  Maybe by the time I'm that age I can have mine removed no problem!

Eyebleach,3daqkg,stanfan114,223,Tue Jul 14 22:52:03 2015 UTC,someone explained it in another post. they use a laser and reflect it off the back of the eye then something something science and lenses and baby can see.

Eyebleach,3daqkg,Wyrmmountain,10,Wed Jul 15 08:10:15 2015 UTC,It's an auto refractor.
Eyebleach,3daqkg,beanmosheen,52,Wed Jul 15 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"There's a handheld tool called a retinoscope.  It projects a beam of light into the eye, and the user (usually an eye doctor) sees a reflection of the beam from the retina through the lenses being used.  The doctor moves the scope to move the beam.  The direction of the beam's reflected movement (with the scope's movement or against the scope's movement) tells the doc which lenses will bring the reflection to neutral movement.  The lenses that neutralize the reflection off of the retina are the person's prescription.  This technique can be used for any nonverbal patient.    TL:DR, Retinoscopes are SUPER helpful."
Eyebleach,3daqkg,iDoc912,15,Wed Jul 15 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"Then why don't they just use this on adults for a more accurate prescription? I always thought ""1 or 2, which is better? 3 or 4,"" as kind of a shitty measurement of our prescription :/"
Eyebleach,3daqkg,potatoesxD,19,Wed Jul 15 10:20:37 2015 UTC,"A subjective refraction (where the doctor asks you ""1 or 2"") gives the doc a lot more info about the quality of the patient's vision through the lenses presented.  Retinoscopy is accurate enough for young patients like the baby in the video, but the results can be fine tuned by getting the patient's input about the lenses.  Day to day, I'll use retinoscopy results as a starting point and then perform a subjective refraction to reach a final Rx.  A lot of patients worry that they'll screw up the test by giving a ""wrong"" answer, but every response, and even how you give the response (like, if you hesitate vs. give a confident answer) gives your doc info about how well you're seeing.  I also tell my patients that if they look the same, don't be afraid to tell me that.  ""The same"" is just as good of an answer as ""1"" or ""2""."
Eyebleach,3daqkg,iDoc912,8,Wed Jul 15 11:44:06 2015 UTC,I had a friend admit to years of slightly off lenses and eye strain headaches because he felt he had to pick the 'best' answer every time. No one had ever said to him he could say two lenses looked 'the same.'

Itd be great to hear, we did this to try and provide the subscribers something unique, if you have other ideas youd like us to try as well let us know!   There's nothing unique about 70% boobs, anymore than there's something unique about 70% animals.  It also assumes that everyone enjoys boobs.  (I, personally, do, but not everyone does.  I don't, however, usually consider them eyebleach.)  If you want more diversity, find ways to encourage it.  But if there's nothing broken about having animal pictures, then don't get rid of them.  There will always be a majority of some kind.  I mean, if you banned them, it'd be 70% nudity.  Do you then ban nudity in the interest of diversity?"

We have encouraged diversity in other ways in the past, people suggested we try an animal free week and we did, its a hassle for us but we are sticking to it.

Eyebleach,3d7wn3,LandMooseReject,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"You're right about that; I was being hyperbolic, because it seemed like that would be the way it would go without animals.  It often is.  Still, the sub is boring with the animal ban.  And the point stands--if you ban animals because there's too many, well, if kids become the majority next, do you ban them, too?  The sub is a lot like /r/aww, because /r/aww is an eyebleachy kind of sub.  But you don't get beautiful landscapes, space photos, or things like this in /r/aww.  To me, it's just an overlap, and that's fine."

While I don't contribute but simply lurk, to me this sub should be a virtual ""bestof"" for aww, earthporn, spaceporn, humanporn, awwducational, prettygirls, occasionally nsfw, etc, maybe with a little frission thrown in there.

The puppy was super scrawny so he raised him up and he knew our dog had died, so he asked if we wanted to take the puppy out for a test drive, keep him one night and see if it fit.  My siblings adored that dog and poured so much love and attention on him.  I thought he was a vile thing coming to make me forget my first dog.  I avoided him for several hours and while I was laying on my bed, my door slightly ajar, he made his way into my room.  He whined that he wanted to be up on my bed.  I looked him right in his face and told him I didn't want him.  I don't know how, he was so small, but he managed to climb up on my bed without any help.  He walked around on my pillow for a little bit and then curled up against my neck and lay his head on my neck/chest.  He was in after that.  I loved that little pup so much.

Eyebleach,3cxfkf,ogami1972,3,Sun Jul 12 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"Toyger:       The toyger is a breed of domestic cat, the result of breeding domestic shorthaired tabbies (beginning in the 1980s) to make them resemble a ""toy tiger"", as its striped coat is reminiscent of the tiger's. The breed's creator, Judy Sugden, has stated that the breed was developed in order to inspire people to care about the conservation of tigers in the wild. It was recognized for ""Registration only"" by The International Cat Association in the early 1990s, and advanced through all requirements to be accepted as a full Championship breed in 2007.   There are about 20 breeders in the United States and another 15 or so in the rest of the world.

Eyebleach,3cv98v,dream6601,4,Sat Jul 11 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"Some dogs treat baby humans like they're their puppies. I have 3 dogs, one is a husky. As a pack animal and the alpha of the 3 dogs, you would think she would be awful with kids. But, we have allowed her to bond with both our sons immediately after birth. She was aware of them before birth, she would push her nose in to my belly button and feel them moving. She was also very lethargic through my labors as if she was having puppies. She immediately become motherly to my sons. She was very protective of them, slept under their cribs, wouldn't let anyone but us in their rooms, she would howl/husky talk when they cried, she would even lick their diapers (outside) when they needed changed (dogs lick their puppies butts to clean them up when they go). So it was immediately obvious that she felt the babies were her own. So, the bond of a pack animal towards a baby is something I would absolutely trust more than a non-pack animal. If the dog loves and basically tries to raise the baby as it own, why would you worry about the dog hurting the baby? My dogs have been hurt by my kids and none have hurt the kids as a reaction. They just yelp and whimper until we get the kids off of them. One of my other dogs is a Great Dane. My kids would get on top of her like a horse and she would just lay down and whimper until either this kid got off her, or we came and picked up the kid."
Eyebleach,3cv98v,showmeswife,2,Sun Jul 12 16:00:15 2015 UTC,They're still smart animals.  It's not going to maul your baby even if baby tugs the ears or pulls the tails.  They will snap to teach and that scares people.  It's best to play with supervision but not overreact.

I don't think there's anything wrong with it as long as it's not harming the animal. The kitten here does not seem to be bothered by it.   There are other reasons for clothing too, like preventing an animal from scratching at a wound, warmth in a cold climate, or to provide comfort (like an anxiety wrap)."
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,far2frail,-6,Wed Jul 8 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"Babies need clothes or else they can get very sick, and I already talked about dogs.  Every animal I've ever seen save for a couple chihuahuas who lived with clothes on seemed to absolutely hate it when the clothes are first put on them. After awhile they get used to them sure, but they obviously don't enjoy it at first. The human owner choosing to do it anyways despite the animal's obvious discomfort is where my issue lays.  Sure, the cat here doesn't seem to mind. But what about at first? Chances are probably not a fan at first.  I also said that there were other reasons for clothing and I understood that, and that my issue lies with people who do it purely for cosmetic reasons. It's an animal, not a fucking doll."

I've known some cats that loathe any kind of grooming or dress up and some that love the attention and thrive wearing their lion cuts, fancy collars, or little outfits.

Eyebleach,3cjcgo,Iheart_pr0n,20,Thu Jul 9 07:33:07 2015 UTC,"You are right, they are pushing way too fucking fast on the plunger in the video."
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,AuMielEtAuxNoix,14,Wed Jul 8 19:27:16 2015 UTC,We found a kitten abandoned who was 10 days old and this is the warning that we got from the vet. We went to a bottle which worked out better- the kitten could use it as it normally would have with its mom and it couldn't drink or be pushed out so fast that he could aspirate.
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,cucumberbun,10,Wed Jul 8 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"came here to say this. apparently you should let kittens suck the formula down themselves, not shove it down their throat and risk them aspirating it. i'm not a vet or anything so it might be wrong, but it sounds right."
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,charizardisadick,4,Wed Jul 8 20:30:41 2015 UTC,We found a 1 day old kitten and we had to hand feed it with syringes every two hours. Initially we had to slowly (painstakingly slowly) depress the syringe to prevent aspiration. Once he reached the age of this kitten in the gif though he would suck down the formula faster than we could depress the plunger. So while I think you're right that it normally shouldn't be done this quickly with young kittens I think at the age of the kitten in the gif that speed is fine.
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,MGNero3,3,Thu Jul 9 03:50:12 2015 UTC,You are right. They shouldnt have to push the food in; this way it could cause lung infection.
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,Girlflesh,6,Wed Jul 8 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"If that's the case then i agree, however from the video, I cant even tell if they're pushing the plunder or if the kitten is sucking the formula out really fast, because it's so hungry. My friend and i found a kitten once and it took to the syringe more than the bottle and the little thing was so hungry we just let it do the work and it quickly sucked the formula out of syringe like in this video. So maybe that's the case? I'd like to think these people wouldn't think forcing the plunger down at that speed was a great idea."
Eyebleach,3cjcgo,flamingturtleraces,2,Wed Jul 8 21:50:37 2015 UTC,That's very true on neonates. This kitten is pretty old though and its not that big a deal. At this point it doesn't even need the syringe.

Eyebleach,3ckfde,Star-spangled-Banner,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Guess I'm looking at it from a different angle, it's common for subs to stray from their intended direction if not moderated a certain way. The popular choice isn't always the best- it would be better for the people who come here for animals to go to aww instead, and better for people who come here for eyebleach relief to get a variety of cute/sexy/happy images- or go to aww if that's what they want.

I just think a little re-framing of the point is in order. Dogs and cats are cute and people have an emotional connection to them, you're never going to get any traction in saying let's not show pictures of tiny cute things.   I think what you want is a balance between the animal posts and other types of eyebleach. So the issue needs to be framed as ""I see a lot of similar content on eyebleach lately... let's try to get new people in and reinvigorate our community by posting some out of the ordinary content like...""  and post some examples of the stuff you want to see.  Telling people their content isn't what you want to see is negative asking people to help you post other types of content is positive. Those are my two cents."

Eyebleach,3bznvx,Iwillanswerwithgifs,18,Fri Jul 3 14:41:37 2015 UTC,it's not real water ski. For Example the Ski are swimming in the water and the Squirrel is just standing on it and a RC boat wouldnt get the needed speed for real skiing. It's all show and the Squirrel is a phony!

Eyebleach,3bznvx,sk_2013,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"It's true. Squirrels have an excellent memory and good reflexes. This actually makes them easier to train than human pilots, and the reduced weight of the pilot (as well as the equipment associated with the pilot's function) allowed Spitfires to outmaneuver the more dangerous BF-109s. Plus, the reduced mass meant that squirrels had a better chance of getting clear of a wrecked aircraft and being able to pull their chute.  The recent steps forward in drone technology has been an effort by the military to minimize the damage of animal rights groups trying to ban the use of squirrels and other animals for combat purposes, though most countries still employ them in logistics roles."

Eyebleach,3beok8,Natholomew4098,2,Mon Jun 29 04:44:00 2015 UTC,I think it's a vizsla. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla
Eyebleach,3beok8,eloisegrownup,2,Mon Jun 29 06:29:59 2015 UTC,"Vizsla:       The Vizsla is a dog breed originating in Hungary, which belongs under the FCI group 7 (Pointer group). The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions, in addition to being the smallest of the all-round pointer-retriever breeds. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics as a hunter of fowl and upland game, and through the centuries the Vizsla has held a rare position among sporting dogs – that of household companion and family dog.  The Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and an outstanding trainability. Although they are lively, gentle mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possessed of a well-developed protective instinct.

Eyebleach,3beok8,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:30:50 2015 UTC,It's either a vizsla or a weimaraner. Weimaraners are just slightly bigger and gray compared to vizslas.

Eyebleach,3ba78s,lateralus821,9,Sat Jun 27 19:06:55 2015 UTC,I guess it's like walking.  At first you crawl and your parents show you how to walk and now it's just something you do. Don't even have to think about it.

Eyebleach,3aqjtz,LordGhoul,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"I see. Yeah apparently only in the US is it cool to do. But really its not totally clear whether or not declawing is actually a big deal. No study is has come close to conclusive results. Any study with a decent time frame showed results where behavior shifted [possibly] where 60% declawed cats showing some negative behavior post declawing, and 50% showing bad behaviors post-any-surgery. Similar numbers of cats showing bad behaviors without any surgery.   Of course these numbers are average estimates based on a ton of shit I read. But I don't think declawing is a bad thing. I have known tons of cats that were declawed and chilled the fuck out after the surgery.   So really, its up in the air still."
Eyebleach,3aqjtz,crossdogz,3,Tue Jun 23 19:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'm against it. It's like removing your fingertips (as literally that bone is removed too). My cat really loves to climb up her cat tree and uses her claws on a daily basis, also when picking up toys or running wildly around the house. I feel like declawing is nothing more than being more concerned about your forniture than your pet. After all, it has no advantage to the animal and only really pleases the owner. Imagine if you had a child that would be able to scratch the forniture, so you remove its fingertips to stop it from that. Way too drastic."
Eyebleach,3aqjtz,LordGhoul,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:44:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but its easily argued that having an animal in general is to please the owner.

Eyebleach,3aqjtz,PretendThisIsAName,4,Tue Jun 23 09:08:31 2015 UTC,Step 1. Imagine a nail clipper.   Step 2. Imagine a cat's claws.  Step 3. ???  Step 4. Profit

Eyebleach,3aqjtz,SJ_RED,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:25:24 2015 UTC,Why would you do that to a cat? Is this an american thing?
Eyebleach,3aqjtz,PretendThisIsAName,3,Tue Jun 23 11:26:47 2015 UTC,"Pure guesswork: Inside cats' claws might grow too long.

Eyebleach,3aoj5x,Draymere-Iris,0,Mon Jun 22 15:49:25 2015 UTC,Not necessarily inbred. It's a naturally occurring genetic mutation. So while they are bread in an attempt to get more white Tigers it doesn't necessarily mean that that's what happened. It is possible though.
Eyebleach,3aoj5x,itstevens,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Naturally it is a very RARE genetic mutation. There are two white tigers there. I'd like to give the benefit of doubt, but there are a lot of organzations that breed white tigers in terrible conditions so they can show off pretty white tigers to paying customers. And even if they aren't inbred, the mutation itself can have lots of really unpleasant health complications. It's not something that should be encouraged."
Eyebleach,3aoj5x,Draymere-Iris,2,Mon Jun 22 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong. I completely agree, I just wanted to make the clarification that it isn't always the case.

Eyebleach,3aip16,IntermolecularForces,95,Sat Jun 20 18:52:19 2015 UTC,My friend works at a zoo and said there's protocols for if they find someone in an exhibit. The hippo exhibit is the only one where they don't even try to save the person - they just clear the area so nobody sees the person get killed.
Eyebleach,3aip16,mechakreidler,37,Sat Jun 20 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Throw a bucket of meat to the lions and they wont give a shit about keepers rescuing some tourist.   Hippos fuck shit up. They dont give a fuck, and will kill you because they are bored. There is no handling a mad hippo, the keepers would only endanger their lives."
Eyebleach,3aip16,tasmanian101,23,Sat Jun 20 20:31:40 2015 UTC,wouldnt they just tranquilize it?
Eyebleach,3aip16,tofu98,34,Sat Jun 20 20:05:21 2015 UTC,Would certainly be hard to tranquilize an animal this big in time
Eyebleach,3aip16,SubcommanderMarcos,8,Sat Jun 20 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"was thinking that just after posting probably why they dont bother, unless maybe the dumb ass who climbed in could just run around until they took effect."
Eyebleach,3aip16,tofu98,14,Sat Jun 20 21:50:07 2015 UTC,"I don't suppose the person who climbed inside a hippo exhibit is the smartest fellow, so here's to hoping I guess"
Eyebleach,3aip16,SubcommanderMarcos,3,Sat Jun 20 21:55:23 2015 UTC,Hippos have a top speed of 30 mph. Faster than Usain Bolt.
Eyebleach,3aip16,BrettGilpin,6,Sun Jun 21 06:16:45 2015 UTC,These ones are actually pygmy hippos. The momma is about 500 pounds tops. So it might be a little easier.
Eyebleach,3aip16,NemesisKismet,10,Sat Jun 20 23:14:34 2015 UTC,"Tranq guns don't work like they do in Metal Gear Solid, son. It's going to take a while (probably around 30 minutes) for the sleeping agent to start being metabolized, and by that time, that dumbass who decided to raid the hippo enclosure is likely little more than a barely identifiable cluster of assorted viscera."
Eyebleach,3aip16,whatthefbomb,6,Sun Jun 21 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure, I guess that would make sense. Maybe the problem is that tranquilizer would take too long to get to? It would be cool if they had a tranq gun behind breakable glass or something, but that might be too accessible to the public."
Eyebleach,3aip16,mechakreidler,5,Sat Jun 20 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"Hippos spend a lot of time in water, so if it is in water when you try to shoot it, you'll most likely fail to hit it. You would only be able to rely on actually puncturing skin if you aim for anything above water, like the back or the top of the head. That's a really difficult target. They can run at up to 20 MPH. [Edit: https://youtube.com/watch?v=cvdj1eYdta4 ] How likely is it that whoever is on hand to use the gun could respond in such a short time. They may know how to handle a weapon like this but that in no way means they could could consistently get the gun, ready it to fire, aim, and take a good shot at such a fast moving target.   I assume that the protocol doesn't actually say ""leave them to the hippos."" What it probably says is ""Get everyone out of sight, if the person is somehow still alive once you've done that, try these other things."""
Eyebleach,3aip16,I_Envy_Sisyphus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:06:45 2015 UTC,couldn't they just use a net to fuck with the hippo?
Eyebleach,3aip16,SlicerDigZ,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"They weigh over nine thousand pounds and have razor sharp teeth. You would need a very strong and heavy net to stop one, so that would not be a quick process. And nets are likely to injure the hippo. The main point is that you could not stop a hippo with a net quickly enough to save someone who got into the hippo exhibit area."
Eyebleach,3aip16,I_Envy_Sisyphus,0,Sun Jun 21 15:50:12 2015 UTC,They can actually run at 30 MPH. Faster than the fastest human alive.

You slowly fade in a pool of your own shit and your opponents shit.   Then the lucky heifers get to have a gross hippo baby put inside them by a shit covered psychopath hulk.   Gross.

Eyebleach,3ag985,drbatookhanxx,3,Fri Jun 19 22:10:53 2015 UTC,"My dog does that spastic (like) reaction with his feet too, can someone explain why?"
Eyebleach,3ag985,Gnunixl,7,Sat Jun 20 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"Sensory neutrons connected to the spinal cord terminate at certain portions of your dog's body (Behind the ears, or on the belly, etc). When these nerves are activated – either by a scratch or a tickle – they quickly send messages to the spinal cord, which then instructs the dog’s leg to kick. For some dogs, the kicking can be more pronounced depending on how much scratching they feel.  The reflex comes about as a protective mechanism. Dogs can't always see or hear when there are parasites or bugs on their bellies, and so if their skin is irritated, the nearest limb attempts to remove the irritation.  The reflex is so reliable and pronounced that veterinarians use it to determine a dog's health. Its presence is a sign of baseline health, and its tempo, whether too fast, too slow, or within limits, is an indicator of further issues."

It is negatively affected by habitat degradation, prey base decline, and hunting, and has therefore been classified as Near Threatened by IUCN since 2002.   The Pallas's cat was named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas, who first described the cat in 1776 under the binomial Felis manul.

They have a particular smell, though mine are unneutered males so they smell strongest of all. (These gliders are clearly all female or neutered because they don't have scent patches on their heads) I don't mind it though.  Fun facts: They're marsupials, they can bond with humans and consider them one of their own, and they always need to be in groups as alone they get depressed and self harm.   Ok so that last fact was not quite as fun, but it's good to know.  They have 4 opposable thumbs and 2 sets of bonded fingers as well that they use for cleaning. They are very personally fastidious but messy eaters (they keep themselves clean but mess up everything else). The thumbs are one per appendage and they use them to climb. The bonded fingers are only their back feet.  They have very distinct personalities. My 3 are all completely different despite being together their entire lives."

Eyebleach,39wuj5,Hokurai,18,Mon Jun 15 18:03:10 2015 UTC,So hanging a lidded bucket of sugar gliders is a normal thing?
Eyebleach,39wuj5,dementeddr,50,Tue Jun 16 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"Look again. See the spot on the right side? That bucket has a hole cut out of it, possibly several (you can only see the edges of the bucket, remember). Sugar Gliders sleep as colonies, all tucked together into a fluffy ball someplace quiet and dark. So yeah, a lidded bucket for sugar gliders is fine. The lid helps keep the dark and noise away, and the holes let them come and go as they please.  EDIT! Also, see the paperclip at the top used to hang it from the cage? This is designed for them to sleep in."

Eyebleach,39wuj5,stonerine,4,Mon Jun 15 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's bad. Exotics stand 0% chance. Even with cats and dogs, their euthanasia rate is astronomical! Last I looked, we're talking in the 90% range.  The like to do things like ""liberating animal testing victims."" While I'm all about stepping in to stop animal testing, just opening the cages and letting them rush out the door is a certainty for death in every one of those creatures. Animals born and bred in captivity do not know how to survive outside and will freeze to death, starve to death, or something's meal."

Eyebleach,39wuj5,necropaw,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:39:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's part of being a Marsupial. Because they are a K-Selective reproduction species (few offspring but higher chance of living) they'll tend to have longer lives because that evolves along with those strategies. Mice are R-Selective and therefore have short lives but hundreds of children to be sure they continue.  Gliders have 1-2 children at a time. Few mammals that do so have short lifespans.

Eyebleach,39wuj5,PaperHatParade,3,Tue Jun 16 00:21:44 2015 UTC,"Sort of like a loud hamster, or a squeaky puppy, almost. They have the cutest (and occasionally annoying) bark when they want attention or are just bored. They also make very clearly irritated noises called crabbing when they're not happy about something. Also cute, but again can get annoying if it happens too much. They also make the tiniest little happy meep-squeaks when they're eating something they really like :) that's my favorite glider noise"

If your dog's mouth is open just a tad, with the sides raised, he may indeed look like he's smiling, but he may actually be anxious, nervous or otherwise in distress. Signs of distress accompanying a stiff smile include heavy panting with the tongue in, whining and chattering teeth. Consult your vet."

Eyebleach,39ezb9,chewb,8,Thu Jun 11 17:28:44 2015 UTC,If i'm not mistaken that mushroom is amanita muscaria. It's a killer of flies (poisonous)  I hope that ladybug is okay  edit: it's also psychoactive

Eyebleach,39ezb9,chewb,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:20 2015 UTC,come to think of it either the ladybug is too big or the mushroom is too small. Amanitas don't get their umbrella shape until they are big enough

In winter, when a darker coat would make them a more visible target for predators, their coats turn snowy white. Only the black tippy-tail stays the same.   When they're brown we call them stoats, and when they're white we call them ermine.   Their fur is particularly luxurious. If you've ever seen historical paintings of European kings you might have noticed that their robes are often trimmed with ermine tails, that's what the white with black spots business is. Throughout history the wearing of ermine was often reserved for royalty.  Thank you for subscribing to Ermine Facts!   To cancel text STOP.  EDIT: Visual Aid  http://imgur.com/GOvEx8R"

Eyebleach,396dk1,Quiquex,4,Tue Jun 9 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"Section 9. Pyramiding of article  Turtle shell:       Pyramiding is a shell deformity commonly found in captive turtles, in which the shell grows unevenly resulting in a ""pyramid"" shape underlying each scute. This deformity can vary in severity from barely noticeable to life-threatening. Note that Indian star tortoises and some other species display this morphology naturally.  Several causes can lead to pyramiding, including excessive animal or vegetable protein; inadequate calcium, sunlight, and/or vitamin D3; and excessive moisture / poor nutrition foods. Once pyramiding has occurred, it cannot be reversed, though if the underlying problem is corrected, the animal may still lead a long, healthy life.

Cats can be different and it can be hard to distinguish between a relaxed and an agitated cat just looking at its tail.

Eyebleach,38sh9z,vorpalrobot,9,Sun Jun 7 22:17:33 2015 UTC,"Your answer was pretty factual   Was it though?  Trying to divine a cat's ""mood"" out of literally one tail swing seems about as far from ""factual"" as a person can get."

You know, I've come to realize that this is the internet version of the ""everything-proof shield"" Neither side has sources, just stuff one guy's read and heard against what another guy's read and heard. By playing the ""link a source plz"" card, you force /u/Jrodkin to dig up sources that neither of you have, but when he doesn't come back, it makes you look like the winner of this argument. (Kind of like how people assume that if you quit an argument, that's because they've won). Alternatively, he has to go put a bunch of work into pulling sources out of his ass just to break even here.  Worse, by demanding a source, you open yourself up to a larger problem. Let's say I want to argue something politically related, and you demand a source. I give you a list of sources from the American Civil Liberties Union. You counter with sources from the American Heritage Foundation. I counter with a link to a study done by the University of California. You counter with a link to a study by the Cato Institute. In all the links to sources (almost all of which will be biased bullshit that just so happens to fit our views) we run into a larger problem- Anyone can source anything nowadays.  So the next time you want to demand a source, just do everyone a favor and shut the hell up."

I guess that I look at claims like ""Based on his tail, I would say that he is a little agitated/irritated"" through a pretty skeptical lens, sorry if that's annoying.  Some things are extremely subjective, like a lot of ""politically related"" related subjects, and I wouldn't ask for a source on whether or not Reagan was a good president for example.   Feline behaviour though? I don't think that asking for a source is unreasonable on that subject.   next time you want to demand a source, just do everyone a favor and shut the hell up.

I don't think that he can tell a cat's behaviour from a swipe of the cat's tail, he does.    I said: if you really want to argue it, better provide a source.    If there's no source, there's not much more to say, we might as well go our separate ways as a couple of non cat behaviour experts with a couple of shitty, frankly non-factual opinions.  I wasn't demanding a source to ""win"" the argument or something, I just think that without it, there's not much point in continuing the conversation.

It would take a bit longer to balance a, what, 30 pound dog on a rope, but in principle it's all the same.  *GENTLY."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,txtphile,13,Thu Jun 4 16:34:32 2015 UTC,Is that how you seriously train a dog to shake? Cause what I've been doing totally doesn't work.
Eyebleach,38iiqv,anddicksays,24,Thu Jun 4 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"seriously. get a thing of the good dog treats, shake your dog's hand, say ""shake,"" (or whatever) and they'll probably get it within a day"
Eyebleach,38iiqv,RussellLawliet,29,Thu Jun 4 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"When my husky was about 5 months old I started training her. 2 months went by and all she knew as her name, and to sit.. she would never shake... day after day we would have multiple sessions but nothing  then.. one night.. I came home.. hammered drunk... I walk in.. I look at her.. ""Kodiak, you're worthless.. but adorable"" and I layed on the kitchen floor with her.. decided to try one more time..   ""Kodiak, left paw""  Paw goes up and she places it in my hand.  I freaked out.. praised her like a goddess. Went in the fridge and fed her soooo much food... left over chicken, deli meat, cheese.   Ever since that day she's the best ""shake"" dog you'll ever met."

Eyebleach,38iiqv,freythman,9,Thu Jun 4 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"Smart dogs like huskies (poodle here) are sorta ""willful."" They need the love from their people or they think (I think) they're being used."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,VodkaHaze,2,Thu Jun 4 21:29:40 2015 UTC,I'm going to try this and report back.
Eyebleach,38iiqv,NoButthole,6,Thu Jun 4 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"It's not the formal method at least. The formal method is with tasty treats in your closed fist and you sort of tempt him with it. He'll push your fist with his nose, lick it, etc. and eventually put his paw on your hand to try to get to the treat.  At the exact moment his paw touches your hand you mark the action with a loud ""yes!"" (or whatever positive marking word; some people use ""clickers"" for this purpose) and instantly release the treat to him.  Repeat. Note that marking the behavior bridges the gap from him doing what you want him to do to him getting paid for his job. He understands much easier this way. The vast majority of advanced training comes down to this method (and breaking down complex behaviors into smaller chunks)."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,VodkaHaze,3,Thu Jun 4 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"Basically, reward the dog for his good behavior, not yours. Forcing you dog to shake means he's going to (probably) assume you will give him a treat if he lets you grab his paw. Great for trimming nails but not great if you want him to shake on command without you initiating."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,NoButthole,3,Fri Jun 5 01:43:19 2015 UTC,Even for trimming nails you'll probably undo the command really fast with what he perceives as punishment for doing what you asked (my dog is almost 2 and I still feed the hell out of him during trimming time to have it be a comfortable experience for him).
Eyebleach,38iiqv,NoButthole,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. We put peanut butter in a Kong's toy and hold it in front of him."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,DaveS1551,3,Fri Jun 5 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"No. The way I've always trained my dogs to shake is to have a treat in my hand and place my hand directly beneath their chin. He'll try to get the treat by moving his head but you gently hold his chin in place so he can't turn his head down. He'll eventually get fed up and use his paw to push your hand down. Give him the treat as soon as he does that.  Once he starts immediately reacting to this by pushing your hand down, start keeping the treat in your other hand and grasping his paw with the shake hand when you give him the treat. So it goes like this: empty hand under chin -> dog pushes hand down -> grab paw like you're shaking it -> give dog treat.  Start throwing in the command somewhere in there so he associates it. After a while you'll just have to hold out your hand and say ""shake"" and he'll pop his paw into your hand.  For most dogs, it's more effective to reward their behavior (pushing your hand down) than it is to reward them for your behavior (grabbing their paw and forcing a shake)."
Eyebleach,38iiqv,chasingchicks,38,Fri Jun 5 14:37:57 2015 UTC,Legitimately wondering how its even possible to train a dog to do that. My roommates dog doesn't even know how to go to the bathroom outside.
Eyebleach,38iiqv,KurayamiShikaku,6,Fri Jun 5 01:57:34 2015 UTC,Depends on breed and the effort and methods you put in to teach a dog tricks.

Eyebleach,38adlq,smilingfemalemachine,9,Wed Jun 3 05:17:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This monkey is much too small to be away from its mother. Its incredibly cruel to deprive an animal from its badic needs and instincts like being with its mother. Just because you think an animal is cute does NOT MEAN you will be able to care for it properly. I have seen so many cases of pet monkeys with illnesses, like rickets and other deficiencies. And because they are intellegent so many develop emotional illnesses due to maltreatment. These illnesses very very often occur in monkeys whose owners tried to care for them and tried to be responsible, but their lack of knowledge on primate wellbeing was the cause. It breaks my heart to see people call a small monket like this cute and say that they want one, because it is all just so brutal and wrong."

Eyebleach,38adlq,time2capsule,4,Wed Jun 3 08:40:09 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I'd love to see one in person because it's just so darn cute! But I'd never seek to own one. Certain animals just aren't meant to be pets.  It breaks my heart to hear about the monkeys developing emotional issues due to improper care. :( I think most people just don't realize that animals have feelings. Which is unfortunate and depressing.
Eyebleach,38adlq,smilingfemalemachine,5,Wed Jun 3 07:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yup. I saw a capuchin monkey come into the zoo because its owners gave it up because it had become aggressive. He had so many emotional issues that he resorted to self mutilation. He pulled hair out of its arms so its forearms were almost completely bare, and his his tail was chewed up so bad half of it had to be amputated. After settling in the indoor enclosure for a few days, he was let into the big outdoor enclosure. He was so overwhelmed by the other monkeys hyperactive behaviour and all the climbing frames and toys, he sat curled up in die corner facing the wall and picking at his arms and slightly rocking back and forth. And he was afraid of all the other monkeys coming up trying to meet him. This all displays the emotional strain a monkey goes through by not being with its own kind, and not being stimulated. Aggression, self mutilation and antisocial behaviour.  Theres a happy ending though :) after two weeks he settled in pretty well and adjusted to the hierarchy, even made friends with the alpha male. He was finally acting like a monkey, swinging and jumping and digging in the ground for insects, playing with the other monkeys, etc. He was no longer aggressive, in fact incredible kind and gentle, it stretched its arms through the fence so the keepers could stroke him and he takes food very gently from them. All signs show that he is now a happy monkey, even though he only has half a tail."
Eyebleach,38adlq,time2capsule,3,Wed Jun 3 08:20:16 2015 UTC,"Omg, HOW SAD! D: Aww, the poor thing! I'm so glad he finally adjusted though, and is somewhere he can be happy and properly taken care of."

Marmosets are very small yes, but adults gain a lot more body weight. Their bodies become a lot wider and they are bigger than this monkey.  Adult marmosets look A LOT different than the babies. They grow wider heads, wider bodies, long tails, and distinctive, long hair on the sides of their heads."

Primary lamellae extend out to form demibranches and are further folded to form the secondary free folded lamellae, which are only attached at their tops and bottoms.  The tertiary lamellae are formed by folding the secondary lamellae in a fan-like shape.  Water moves slowly in one direction over the gills and lamellae, into the mantle cavity and out of the octopus’ funnel.

Eyebleach,383nq2,tornato7,27,Tue Jun 2 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"Not to take anything away from the deer's graceful movement, but humans are exceptional runners, our ancestors hunted deer by chasing them until they dropped from exhaustion.  It's called persistence hunting.  But yeah, we're not very pretty when we run, not unless the person is good looking and it's played in slow motion."
Eyebleach,383nq2,SteadyDietOfNothing,8,Tue Jun 2 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"Persistence hunting:       Persistence hunting is a hunting technique in which hunters use a combination of running, walking,  and tracking to pursue prey to the point of exhaustion. While humans can sweat to reduce body heat, their quadrupedal prey would need to slow from a gallop in order to pant.   Today, persistence hunting is very rare and seen only in a few groups such as Kalahari bushmen and the Tarahumara or Raramuri people of Northern Mexico. The technique requires endurance running – running long distances for extended periods of time - and among primates, endurance running is only seen in humans. Persistence hunting is thought to have been one of the earliest forms of human hunting, having evolved 2 million years ago.

Eyebleach,383nq2,autowikibot,7,Tue Jun 2 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"Which always baffles me, I mean you look at a human running and there's so much shifting of weight going on compared to a deer, it looks incredibly inefficient.   Also one of the reasons we make great persistence runners is our simple ability to carry a water bottle, so we're able to refuel without stopping long. We have other awesome advantages, too, but just trotting looks easier for a deer than for a human."
Eyebleach,383nq2,tornato7,12,Tue Jun 2 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"It's not out ability to carry a water bottle, it's that our other heat dissipation is so efficient. We can actively sweat and carry heat away in our breath. Most animals can only sweat very very little and exhaust most heat out of their mouth, but they cannot efficiently get the heat out when they are in a gallop (running fast enough for all feet to be off the ground at one point in the stride) because they can't pant and gallop at the same time. Watch your dog, he can't pant and run at the same time.  Humans can't outrun the animal but we don't need to stop to get rid of heat so we can run distance which animals can't do.  The animal can't run very far so we chase it down, it sprints to some bush far off because it needs to stop and rest, we catch up, rinse, repeat until we just catch up faster than the deer can recover and we spear it/beat it to death.  Also our ass is HUGE. Check out them glutes, man, we were meant to go far.  And just to tackle father up comments that the deer look better than humans running, these were adorable, fit deer in a trot. Yeah, it's fucking cute. Have you seen a fit human in a trot (jog)? Doesn't look to bad.  If you want grace, go check out a beaver running."
Eyebleach,383nq2,wingmanly,2,Tue Jun 2 10:39:56 2015 UTC,So are there any other animals that have evolved the ability to exhaust heat while they run?
Eyebleach,383nq2,court12b,3,Tue Jun 2 11:25:01 2015 UTC,Other primates can sweat through their armpits like humans do and I have it on a wiki's authority that horses are apparently pretty heavy sweaters.

Eyebleach,383nq2,old_gold_mountain,40,Mon Jun 1 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, they were likely either coming from or going to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, an 80,000 acre nature reserve directly adjacent the Golden Gate Bridge.  Or it could have been the one next to that, the Muir Woods National Monument.  Or maybe the one next to that, the Mt Tamalpais State Park.  Come to think of it, the whole area north of the Golden Gate bridge is one giant nature reserve, and without that bridge, if the deer wanted to get to San Francisco, they'd have to go all the way around via, god forbid, Oakland.  I don't think that bridge ""paved over"" any of the deer's natural habitat - they weren't swimming across San Francisco Bay before humans got there."

Eyebleach,37s0sh,Actamis,14,Sat May 30 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"Call me crazy but I literally think that /u/GallowBoob is somehow connected to reddit via a job or something like that. By posting so much content (which is mostly good content, I do admit) they help keep the site running in case submissions have gone down or something. Basically like keeping the site interesting/relevant and not relying solely on voluntary users. Or the dude lives at home and spends all their time farming karma lol.  I am beginning to thing that /u/GallowBoob is possibly more than one person fishing/searching for content to repost and get the highest score of any redditor before their first cake day. Even though I could be totally wrong, that sounds like a worthy motive to me.  Some people think some of the ""mega-accounts"" are alternate accounts of some mods that steal the thunder of posts that they see up and coming. I wouldn't be too surprised if his were one of these.  /u/GallowBoob and /u/ibleeedorange are karma whores and possibly manipulators that reach the front page multiple times per day.  I have both of those names tagged as ""Professional Redditor."" I've had a post reach the front page before. I don't see the motivation in doing what they do.  I would guess that they're able to throw a few (thousand dollars) front pages a certain site's way. The reddit TOS says you should aim for no more than 1/10 of your own content in your submissions. Submit more than 20 per day, have people follow you, now you can send hundreds of thousands of pageviews to a site by mixing it in sporadically, and you're not even breaking the rules.  That would be a nice theory if it wasn't for the fact all he/she ever submits are reposts.  I don't see why that invalidates the theory  He just posts stuff from the viral section of imgur's gallery. There's tons of highly upvoted stuff, you just run it through karmadecay and see what hasn't been posted to reddit yet, then spam it to a bunch of popular subreddits. Anyone can do that, he just does it full time.  I noticed him only a few days ago. I think it is more than one person using this account, no way one person can find that many interesting things in one day.  You wanna talk about pathetic,  He did an AMA once...""I'm often on the front page of Reddit, AMA""   Only reason I know when he posts is because I've downvoted his reposts so much that there's a big red number next to his name in RES."

""Lamb chops""  Ok, I admit I don't know my sheep from my goats avoid eating anything from either. Incidentally in Chinese 羊 means both sheep and goat.  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8A#Definitions    caprid, eg. sheep, goat, antelope    Though if you translate goat in Google Translate it comes up with 山羊. 山 means mountain. So goats are 'mountain caprid'. If they're domesticated you can call them  家山羊  家 is house. So a domesticated goat is a house mountain caprid. Take off all the prefixes and 羊 just means 'sheep'.  Of course Biblically 'separating the sheep from the goats' seems to be a metaphor people were expected to understand  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats  http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/separate+the+sheep+from+the+goats  You can sort of imagine it if you were herding sheep back in 1st Century Judea that wild goats would mix with them. Or something.  So how do you translate it into Chinese? Glad you asked.  http://holybible.com.cn/matthew/25-32.htm   32萬民都要聚集在他面前，他要把他們分別出來，好像牧羊的分別綿羊山羊一般：33把綿羊安置在右邊，山羊在左邊   The key bit is this   分別綿羊山羊一般   I.e. they use 綿羊 = sheep and 山羊 = goats. 綿 means cotton, and wool  I've forgotten what my point is..."

Eyebleach,37lhno,CappyJack,2,Fri May 29 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"If you go by the names of many animals, it can be all confusing.  No matter the language.  Like dragonflies.  They're neither dragons, nor flies.  Red pandas are more closely related to raccoons than anything.  People will call a koala a koala bear, but it's not a bear.  There's possums and opossums, which are very different animals.  Even plants.  There's elephant ears, which aren't ears of an elephant (but they look like it).  Birds of paradise have petals that look like the beak and crest of some strange tropical bird.  Sunflowers aren't made from gaseous balls of matter in the sky.  Bluebells aren't actual bells that ring.  ....What I'm getting at here, is the name of something doesn't necessarily mean it's the same thing, or really related at all.  But it does make sense that goats and sheep would have similar naming in some languages, since they often look similar in ways.  And if you were to see some strange new animal that looked similar to one you already knew, it's likely that you would try to describe it based its differences from the animal you knew.  But it's still a goat."
Eyebleach,37lhno,dfn85,2,Thu May 28 20:10:06 2015 UTC,I think Sunflowers are called that because they are turning towards the sun and because they are so massive it is far easier to see and somethinmg you can mark them by.

Eyebleach,37bch4,LupoBorracio,1 point,Wed May 27 09:33:01 2015 UTC,Well don't worry about it because they're not genetically engineered. They were selectively bred.
Eyebleach,37bch4,AmbidextrousDyslexic,1 point,Wed May 27 15:41:41 2015 UTC,That would make sense. I feel like I fell for an obvious trap.
Eyebleach,37bch4,through_a_ways,23,Wed May 27 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"They're a wild animal. What do you expect? They are fun as fuck to study, though."
Eyebleach,37bch4,MrSeacucumb3r,-12,Tue May 26 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"I always considered the whole domestication concept to be a little soft in the hard science category. The term is so squishy, I can see how herd animals and breeding for sure changes some characteristics, usually physical but to some degree temperament.  But, I also know that if you leave a bunch of ""domesticated dogs"" or (domesticated lol) cats live on their own in the wilds and reproduce, ""domestication"" seems to disappear rather fast."
Eyebleach,37bch4,LupoBorracio,21,Tue May 26 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, a group of researchers in russia did experiments with selective breeding to better understand the process of domestication. With foxes, for example, they found they gained dappled coats, floppy ears, started wagging tails, and responded to pointing, without intentionally selecting for anything but responsiveness to human contact. You can buy the product of their experiments for a large sum of cash. There was an article on their experiments in National Geographic a few years back."
Eyebleach,37bch4,LupoBorracio,11,Tue May 26 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"The other thing is that many of those traits you mentioned are found in the wild type, but only in infants.    In chimpanzees, for example, the infants have faces that much more closely resemble those of humans:  relatively flat, orthogonal faces, with very little dental prognathism.   Adult chimpanzees have extreme dental prognathism, and very strongly sloped foreheads  The flat face thing is very noticeable among wolves, dogs, and foxes too.  The infants always have flatter faces compared to the adults."
Eyebleach,37bch4,Promarksman117,8,Tue May 26 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, canids/dogs are very responsive to selective breeding. I have an Australian Cattle Dog, they've not been around terribly long and come about from mixing the Dingo and Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers.   I read recently that scientist believe most modern dogs come either from dingo or timber wolf lines and then get intertwined from there.  I find it curious that modern dogs:    ""cannot interbreed with members of the wider dog family: the Canidae, such as South American canids, foxes, African wild dogs, bat-eared foxes or raccoon dogs; or, if they could, their offspring would be infertile.""   It makes me wonder how many fall in the ""they can"" but ""offspring would be infertile"" category."

Eyebleach,37bch4,ElChristoph,6,Tue May 26 21:57:08 2015 UTC,Domestication is a sociobiological term talking about the relationship between humans and non-human animals. Of course it's squishy. We aren't talking about physics here.

Now, I'm not a furry, but I have friends who are, and I have been pretty active in the scene for about ten years or so, so I've gotten to know lots of them. And most were strictly against bestiality and stuff like that. Many IRC channels would even auto-ban you for just discussing the topic.  The guy from the video/gif is also a well known figure, and no, as far as I know, he's just a regular dude who likes foxes and fursuits. That's all."
Eyebleach,37bch4,Jumbojet777,10,Tue May 26 16:46:45 2015 UTC,And even when furries are into yiff (furry porn for the uninitiated) they are normally uninterested in bestiality. Like people who watch tentacle hentai probably don't want to be fucked by an octopus.

The Native Americans did it. When you think about it, what we call ""furries"" today have never really been rare. This is just the modern manifestation of it."

There are most definitely people having kinky-ass sex there. Do you find that weird? Probably not.

Should we also domesticate lions so we can take them for rides?"

It has a ton of energy be its difficult, but if it is taken care of it would be way happier.

She was a fully functional person until the day she went to work while construction was being done in the store next door. A worker was putting nails into a wall and was unaware that each time he pulled the trigger on the nail gun it was sending nails through the wall, across the store, and into the skull of said woman working the register. Now this woman has memory issues, speech issues, difficulty using her limbs, and more...  I don't know how they do it, I'm not strong enough to do live like that.

The funny thing is, it's the small, harmless animals that are impacted the most by these invasive species. Cats kill native birds which are hardly harmful or dangerous. Foxes kill many small mammals, reptiles and other ground dwelling creatures which are hardly harmful. Carp destroy river bank and cloud the water with mud, destroying local plant life and impacting fish populations, which are once again hardly harmful. Cane toads look like an easy meal for any prospective native predator, but they have decimated populations of our mammalian predators because they're poisonous. This all has had an impact on their respective ecosystems and the loss of populations in these areas is actually quite distressing. Australia is in an ecological crisis, we're losing our native flora and fauna. Many species that still exist are in much less abundance than even ten years ago. That is why we don't mollycottle our invasive species, because they're destroying what makes Australia unique."

Eyebleach,370ybt,zeeeeera,9,Sun May 24 00:57:06 2015 UTC,Tape a cat treat to your chest and lean down so she reaches up for it and that's when you pick her up. Let her have the treat so she expects it with every hug. Repeat until you're out of treats.

It's just that in Ireland there was no other way of introducing SSM other than by popular vote, at least without it being left open to a (more than likely successful) legal challenge.   On the other hand, the only other countries that I know of that have held referendums on SSM, held referendums on constitutionally defining marriage as between one man and one woman in order to prevent any attempts by the judiciary or the Parliament to introduce SSM."
