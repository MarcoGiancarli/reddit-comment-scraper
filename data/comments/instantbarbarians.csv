instantbarbarians,3doh76,OneOtherRedditor,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to assume you know literally nothing about League. So the big purple thing the blue team is fighting is Baron Nashor. It has a ton of health, does a lot of damage to anything nearby, takes a fairly long time to take BUT it gives the team that kills it a huge buff that usually gives the team that takes it a huge boost to winning the match. Long story short, it's a big deal.  So TSM just won a fight leaving only Piglet alive, they go for baron, which by all rights is theirs for the taking at this point. The 'jungler' on their team, Santorin, has an ability called Smite, which at this point in the game does about 750 instant damage to any neutral monster, and means that when it gets low all he needs to do is use smite on the baron and they secure it.  Piglet is wandering around outside the pit, TSM has complete vision of him, while Piglet has no vision of what's happening inside the pit. He can't see the baron's health or how quickly it's dying or anything. He walks up, fires a completely blind shot into the pit, and manages to hit it RIGHT at the point where HE gets the killing blow on it, and takes it away from TSM. Even WITH vision on baron this would have been insane, the fact that he just went ""About... now would do it"" is unbelievable.  Disregarding the fact that Santorin is a pretty shit jungler and didn't even bother to use smite here..."

instantbarbarians,3doh76,OneOtherRedditor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think Liquid, the team that stole it, had vision on the area so Piglet couldn't see how much health Baron had, so he just kinda threw his ability out there and got it. Baron gives the team that kills it a huge buff and that steal swung the momentum of the game"
instantbarbarians,3doh76,PacmanAteMe,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:01 2015 UTC,So it literally was a blind steal and Piglet threw his ability out there just because? I can see the hype around it now lol.

Real e-sports like Dotar, CS:GO, etc aren't as likely to have trash like that.    I'm all for having fun, and can understand their excitement for their passion, but shouting at your competition repeatedly saying ""YOU SUCK!"" at the top of their lungs isn't sportsmanlike, humble, professional, etc.  Find me a video of someone from a real esport who does that."
instantbarbarians,3czinh,bugattikid2012,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:04 2015 UTC,Let's not trash all COD players. COD4 promod on PC was hugely popular for a long period of time with competitors who respected each other. But I agree these console COD players are filth.
instantbarbarians,3czinh,vinChilla,4,Sun Jul 12 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"Note: Not trying to sound aggressive, or passive aggressive, etc.  While I can see how I implied that all CoD players are that way, it's like that with any stereotype.  Stereotypes exist for a reason, but that doesn't mean everyone is that way.  Trust me, I used to play CoD on le ole peasant box, and I was that 10ish year old who would rage hardcore sometimes.  Does this make all kids who play CoD ragers?  No, but the majority of those who raged like that were kids in my age group.    I didn't start like that until I picked it up from others, and this is coming from the guy who hates conforming to anything.  I could go into details of why I think this happened, yet I'm resilient to other examples of conformity, that's a whole different topic, and would take a long time to type up.    CoD4 and CoD 9(? 10? whatever they're all the same anyways) are two completely different games, from entirely separate times.  Do they even have PC competitions with CoD?  I thought a lot of those competitions were sponsored by either M$ or Sony (usually M$) and all were on a peasant box of some sort (I've never heard of a PC CoD comp at least).    Out of curiosity, why would one play CoD now over something like BF4, CS:GO, or the MANY, MANY PC alternatives?"
instantbarbarians,3czinh,bugattikid2012,5,Sun Jul 12 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"I believe COD4 is not as popular as it once was. Competitive COD4 PC was much more popular in Europe than in it was in the states and it was played using a mod called promod which is a modification upon the ""search and destroy"" game mode. Promod trimmed a lot of the fat from the game and made it less random and chaotic and more based on skill. Promod has existed for many many years and the most skilled PC COD players would pretty much always play promod and I wouldn't be surprised if there are competitions still around today. You could watch some gameplay of a famous competitive PC COD player phantasy here.  As for the mentality of the players, you wouldn't find them any different from professional CS players or any other professional e-sports player for that matter unlike the scrubs in the video above. If you played in pub matches you would definitely find the occasional rager here and there but much less infrequently than you would on a regular server or on consoles. I find that the negative stereotype of COD players mostly comes from console players and not PC ones as Call of Duty on consoles was much more popular than it was on PC.  As for your last question Battlefield is not a good esport game imo. Battlefield 3 was probably my favorite FPS ever but it's simply too slow to be played competitively although I am aware some professional Battlefield gaming clans exist. People play COD over other FPS games probably because of personal preference (the same reason people play DOTA over League of Legends or CS 1.6 over CS:GO). However, I do know that some COD players have since migrated to CS."
instantbarbarians,3czinh,vinChilla,3,Sun Jul 12 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't you consider BF4 to be a good esport?  The ""netcode"" issues are quite overrated, recent tests have shown that upon release time, it had ~ 3ms more delay than CS:GO did at the time... aka netcode is fine.  Now, tests show that it's better than CS:GO, so those issues shouldn't be mentioned.    As far as game play wise, the speed of the game play is entirely dependent on your play style.  If you want to go safe but slow, you can.  If you want to rush and go full retard, you can.  If you want to screw around and have hilarious moments, you can.  If you want to win, you can.    The meta/pub of BF4 is pretty retarded in my opinion, people play conquest like it's TDM + vehicles.  If you know what you're doing, you won't play it that way.  It takes a while to adjust though.  I  remember when BF3 came out, and I was trying it out.  LOVED the campaign, they did quite a lot with it in my opinion (I know compared to a story only game it doesn't compare too well, but multiplayer has always been and always will be the primary focus of things like BF, so a campaign like BF3's is a pretty big deal.).  Tried multiplayer out, and couldn't get it down quite right.  Flopped between BF and CoD for a while, eventually going completely solo and away from a clan I was VERY active in, just to play BF.  Once you figure out how it's meant to be played, you'll never go back.  Teamwork is rewarded more, and it's more skill based than CoD seems to be.    As far as my mentions of com CoD in my earlier posts, I wasn't talking about WaW, I was talking about current CoDs and how they compare to other games.  My mention of CoD vs BF4 wasn't specifically relating to comp either, just a general topic related to everyone.  BF4 as an esport isn't very large due to the large bandwagon that hates BF just because it's popular to hate it, despite their own findings.  I could rant about my extremely in depth experience with pretty much any issues you could imagine with BF4, but that again is another topic, and takes a while to type up.  To sum it up, somewhere around 45ish + hours on the phone with EA, 27 tickets on one account (another 9 or so on another account) where they've been reopened/resumed multiple times due to the same issue happening again, extremely unique issues where the first thing they tried should have fixed it but didn't, yadda yadda yadda, escalated to DICE devs 2 times that I know of, yadda yadda yadda, I could go on.  I still don't think BF4 was as bad as it was made out to be on release.  Sure a lot of people had issues, but a lot of people didn't have issues and still talk about issues with it, or have very minor issues.    What do you think holds BF4 back from being a good esport?"
instantbarbarians,3czinh,bugattikid2012,2,Sun Jul 12 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"I never mentioned anything about netcode. I am aware of the launch issues that BF4 had but never played a single minute of it. I can however, comment on the gameplay of BF3 as I have around 350 hours logged onto that game and as they are both very similar games, I believe commenting on the efficacy of BF3 as a competitive esport goes just the same as BF4. Keep in mind I have many more hours logged into COD4 and just COD4, not any of the other titles in the series. I'd like to emphasize that Battlefield is not more skill based than promod is. I consider myself a much better Call of Duty player than a Battlefield player and occasionally I have issues playing successfully in COD4 promod pubs.  That being said, I am not saying BF4 is a bad game. I'm sure if I played it I would have just as much fun playing it as I did BF3. I do not hate on it, nor have I really ""hated"" on any game since I was in high school. The reason that Battlefield as a SERIES, not just an individual game, has never or will never be a popular competitive esport at least on PC, is because of again, its slow pace and style. Think of a game like Arma which is a great game but you can imagine why it will never be a popular esport. Doesn't matter how fast or aggressive you play it, you are hindered by the mechanics of the game. On top of that, game modes like Conquest or Rush are not optimal for a competitive gamer like Search and Destroy is. Again, Conquest is too slow and although Rush is faster paced, it's linear style is no good in a competitive setting. On top of that, because of the limited/non-existent modding capabilities that the games offer, players can't change the game to MAKE it a competitive game unlike other popular esport titles out there.  That is one of the reasons why Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, not talking about World at War, is the most popular Call of Duty esport title on PC. It is also the platform where you will find the best Call of Duty players period. Promod is one of the main reasons why COD4 has enjoyed the longevity that it has had and although it is slowly dying out (but still kicking), it will remain as one of the best PC FPS games ever played in competition.  When looking for a good competitive FPS game, the most important thing is limiting random events that can kill you. You are also looking for a good balanced game with no overpowered weapons, powerups, or vehicles. This means destructible environments, nade spam, jets, tanks, helicopters are all negative. You want a game that evaluates teamwork and an individual player's pure skill and nothing more. This is why games like Counterstrike, COD4 Promod, TF2, and even Halo 3 are/were so popular in the esports arena and why Battlefield was and never will be, nor is it trying to.  As an aside, current Call of Duty games are pretty much trash. The only respected titles in the series are COD2 and COD4 maybe COD3 and COD5 but not really."

In this build, they are attempting to boost a Mazda Protege. They installed a turbo and this was their first time testing it out. That high pitch whistle is the turbo spooling up. The ""flutter"" is the blow-off valve. Which activates when pressure peaks in the turbo and it needs to be released."
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,Homsar98,13,Wed Jul 1 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"To add a little info. A turbo is essentially an air compressor. The more air you get into your engine, the more fuel you get into your engine, thus more power. In order to create ""boost"" you basically need a REALLY fast air compressor and a turbo is just that, it has turbine blade just like a jet inside a housing. When exhaust fires through the manifold it goes into one side of the turbo, think like when you blow on a like fan, you make the blades move. Well, when you make those blades move from the exhaust you're make the turbine on the other side move air INTO the engine. The more exhaust, the more air in adding upon itself. 1psi is hard to create, no human can blow 1psi and this little shit rig was creating 11psi of boost, that's A LOT, especially for not being tuned and the gear they were using. When you let off the gas the turbo doesn't just stop boosting, it's still spinning fast, like 115,000 rpm - seriously, so you use oil to cool it and to act as a bearing because ball bearings can't stand that speed. So.... foot off gas, turbo still makes boost, boost has to go somewhere, that somewhere is a ""blow off valve"" or ""waste gate"" and if you need that thing, it means you making boost! So, they made boost, needed the gate, got excited when shit mobile worked, mostly, properly.."
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,dinosquirrel,2,Wed Jul 1 06:55:33 2015 UTC,This is the correct explanation
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,Murse_Pat,2,Wed Jul 1 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"Wrong, its not the blow-off valve.  If there was a blow-off valve it would be a TSHHHH sound, but if there is no blow-off valve, the air dams up behind the turbo and slows it down, which makes that flutter noise."
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,Benedoc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:10:42 2015 UTC,That would be blow back from the intake.
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,knukles,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:56:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know that expression, but I know for sure: Turbo flutter is air pushing back through the turbo because it cant go through the closed throttle body.  And because that is bad for the turbo and throttle response, people use a blow-off valve, which sounds completely different."
instantbarbarians,3bok7h,Benedoc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. It was just a term to use for that description. The excess boost is pushing back on the turbo. That is the case on quite a few semi's...it's just like what the other guy said. The BOV isn't there, or it's too tight."

instantbarbarians,3azec2,initialsdrummer,2,Thu Jun 25 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"So the problem is, for the challenges they are working on, you have to clear every peg.  BUT you can't clear all the orange pegs before you get all the blues, because the game is over once you clear the oranges. You could easily get down to a few pegs left but screw yourself by accidentally hitting the last orange.  The basic game isn't all /that/ difficult. But all these challenges are."

Although there is no competitive map that is long enough range for the awp inaccuracy to have any effect. Most notably the damage falloff is on pistols, especially the glock. For the glock, even on pistol round when no one has head armor, if the enemy is a certain distance away, it will not kill with a single headshot, but instead do about ~85 damage. Also for the p250 and five-seven pistols, they are both one shot headshots even if the enemy has head armor but only if you are close enough, if you are not close enough it will only dink them for roughly ~85 damage as well."

The real value might be anything between 0 and the number of games. If you got that sequence and you played 561 274 more games you might get the same sequence in each of those games. The chance for that would be (1/561274)561274 though.

The last phase was reality TV now we are moving into self produced, marketed and ran channels tailored to very specific users.   These Twitch streamers have their chat on while they stream and the interaction betweent he streamer and the viewers actually guides that days programing. So if they want him/her to play a cetain game, he will. Guess what that does for their ratings? Its instantaneous. The viewer has a direct cause and effect relationship with the streamer. Not only does this create a new dimension of immersion, but also allows the direct flow of funding from the Customer to Content Creator by means of donating $ or bitcoin to either read a post, or play a prank, or anything really.

instantbarbarians,3848sx,BitcoinBoo,2,Mon Jun 1 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"There is a south park episode about this actually.  As someone who watches twitch for competitive gaming i'm caught in the middle. I enjoy watching twitch to view pro teams play pro teams in Dota 2 and Counter Strike GO for example. Dota 2's biggest yearly tournament is coming up, and the prize pool will be around 10-15 million dollars. Last year the winning team of 5 players got about 6 million i believe. In that way, Twitch.tv serves as a medium similar to telivision for people who watch E-sports.  However most of twitch is just poeple streaming. Some are ""personalities"", some are pro gamers just streaming as they practice playing (imagine if you could just tune in and watch your favorite football player practice), some are popular because they are attractive women....  What this streamer ""sodapopin"" represents is a replacement of communal videogame playing. Whereas my parents would say to me ""why don't you and your friends go outside and play instead of gaming"", my response to kids who watch these streamers is ""why dont you play videogames with your friends instead of watching someone else play games"".  So instead of how I would take turns playing and watching my buds playing sonic or mario, young kids watch their favorite personality play videogames."

instantbarbarians,3848sx,guy990,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'd be swearing quite a bit too if I had that insanity as a hand.  In general though twitch has a few different crowds who watch streamers for different reasons.  Some are just entertaining streamers either doing research streams for a youtube vid or playing any game for fun, some are extremely talented (highly skilled League, Dota, Starcraft, Counterstrike and probably even Magic the Gathering players, video game speedrunners, etc).  The interaction with their chat channel often makes the act of viewing more fun than just a youtube vid.  And then there's the 'interactive' channels on twitch, essentially pioneered by a channel called Twitch Plays Pokemon where chat members would enter commands into the chat to control the game by group consensus.  It was absurd, hilarious, and streamed constantly, nearly bringing down twitch's servers at times due to how many eyes were on it and how swarmed the chat was.  Not to be outdone, several other 'Twitch Plays' channels popped up, and a parody channel called Fish Plays Pokemon popped up with a webcam splitting a fishtank into a control grid and letting the fish 'control' the game.  This proved so radical an idea that the envelope was pushed again with Fish vs Fish (or 'Fish Play Streetfighter') where two fish use the same means of control to 'play' a match in street fighter.  Betting and fandoms rose around each fish and so far as I know there is another season pending.  So there's definitely some people pushing streaming as its own interactive format."

The wings are clearly just flat pieces of cardboard with ailerons.  Edit: I just thought this was a neat example of some physics, but I guess other people disagreed."
instantbarbarians,36prwb,haminacup,2,Thu May 21 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty unstable, and I doubt it would fly nearly as well, or at all, if it was scaled up to plane size."
instantbarbarians,36prwb,lochinvar11,1 point,Fri May 22 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, it's not optimal, but if planes flew purely because the top of the wing had to be longer than the bottom of the wing, then this thing wouldn't fly at all -- stable or otherwise."
instantbarbarians,36prwb,haminacup,1 point,Fri May 22 06:21:44 2015 UTC,What is the equal-transit-time explanation?  Obviously flat pieces of cardboard work for flight.
instantbarbarians,36prwb,Crixomix,1 point,Wed May 27 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"The common misconception is that planes fly because the length of the top of the wing is longer than that of the bottom (here is a cross-section of a wing).  As the argument goes, in order for the air on the top and bottom to travel over the wing in the same amount of time, the air on top must be going faster.  By some simple fluid dynamics (namely the Bernoulli equation), this means the pressure on the top of the wing is lower and the plane rises.  This explanation hinges, however, on the idea that the air on the top and bottom must traverse the wing in an equal amount of time.  This is false; there's no magical agreement between air particles to reunite after being separated by the wing.  And anyway, when you look at the supposed physics of this explanation, in order to lift something like a 747, you'd need a wing that was taller than it was wide (I think... I remember reading that it'd be ridiculously tall).  The actual mechanics of airplane flight are actually much more complex than the equal-transit-time explanation, and I only understand bits and pieces myself."
instantbarbarians,36prwb,haminacup,2,Wed May 27 06:24:24 2015 UTC,"Oh. You're forgetting angle of attack here. The only reason planes fly is pressure below wing is higher. Whether that's from transit time, or the fact that the wing is tilted and therefore smashing the air in front/below it... Well that's the debate I guess. But the cardboard plane only flies because of angle of attack and the subsequent pressure changes. If you aimed it at exactly horizontal, it would lose altitude."

instantbarbarians,33fwyc,guaranic,34,Wed Apr 22 08:28:20 2015 UTC,"From /r/youtubehaiku  Alright story time:  Micheal, the blonde, kid kept on harassing other kids that he ""was the best chess player in the state"" however his arrogance heightened when he boasted he'll beat Luke, the kid opposing him, in chess. No one actually cared   The whole school had enough of his arrogant behaviour thus we hosted the chess event for charity and titled it UCC ultimate chess championship akin to the boxing tittle UFC. It was a $2 entry to spectate the event which also had a camera streaming the chess board on to the class projector. It was also fitted with 4 rowers of spectating stands which was just 2 tables fitted with a chair on top. This is pretty much a work safe violation.  The atmosphere was pretty much ecstatic. Some of use where sarcastic, others were serious but as a whole picture we wanted to be rowdy for the sake of nothing. How we had the teachers support I have no idea   Post event: we had the whole room trashed,  2 kids in a detention. Luke was given an F1 ceremony with him being baptised with champagne, a hero's triumph for slaying the beast. Transitioning to Micheal, he was pretty much grieving, suffering from the wounds Luke had inflicted mid game and from the concussion from the last finishing blow. He didn't even attend class for the rest of the day they were that traumatic: physically and mentally.   As the saying goes there's a silver lining to every dark cloud, the arrogant chess master Micheal was no more (he would actually shut the f*ck up)"

Basically you push/scoop it with your backfoot while your frontfoot just kind of hangs there, rather than popping it with your backfoot and manipulating the board with your frontfoot. It's really old school and weird and hard to distinguish from a regular varial flip unless it's done perfectly, which it nowadays rarely is."

instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,MixedWithFruit,9,Mon Mar 16 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"I assume it's like a water bottle or protein drink or something, but the drink is in so few frames it's easy for me to imagine that's it's a fruity cocktail with an umbrella in it."
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,N8CCRG,4,Mon Mar 16 15:20:33 2015 UTC,A shaker is for mixing up protein powder :b

instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,NightO_Owl,5,Tue Mar 17 02:17:10 2015 UTC,i love the tongue poking out when she realizes shes done it
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,gutlessness,6,Mon Mar 16 05:07:41 2015 UTC,Source here with sound: http://ink361.com/app/users/ig-4327382/d_crossfits/photos/ig-921996158717738186_4327382 The reactions are brilliant

instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,ScottWPilgrim,-4,Mon Mar 16 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"That I don't care if I get downvotes. I'm still posting a funny joke, goddamit."
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,Dawgs000,2,Wed Mar 18 04:58:26 2015 UTC,Is that why you deleted your comment?
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,ScottWPilgrim,-1,Wed Mar 18 08:03:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I feel like you are having trouble using the internet.  Direct me to this deleted comment."
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,Dawgs000,2,Wed Mar 18 08:08:40 2015 UTC,"Parent comment of mine. Though deleted, I still remember it as not even being close to humor."
instantbarbarians,2z6mxq,ScottWPilgrim,-3,Wed Mar 18 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"I've deleted nothing; all still looks as it should from my end.  And what I wrote was fairly funny.  However, you seem like a humorless bore, so I find your opinion on humor wanting.  Edit: ah, I just signed out to test a theory, and the comment shows deleted from there.  Looks like a mod got rid of it."

instantbarbarians,2z561t,Osama_bin_Lefty,31,Sun Mar 15 20:31:46 2015 UTC,You won't because I can't.  That doesn't make what he did a muscle up.

instantbarbarians,2z561t,Osama_bin_Lefty,6,Sun Mar 15 20:40:21 2015 UTC,Fuck this mentality.  Fuck crossfit.

instantbarbarians,2z561t,cigerect,5,Sun Mar 15 18:42:19 2015 UTC,It's like his top half and bottom half came from two different bodies.
instantbarbarians,2z561t,joestorm4,6,Mon Mar 16 05:54:15 2015 UTC,He looks like Joe Swanson.
instantbarbarians,2z561t,LiftHeavyThings,3,Mon Mar 16 16:11:34 2015 UTC,Hahahaha I can't believe this is the first time I'm seeing Jon North on this subreddit. Every moment if his life is instant barbarian.
instantbarbarians,2z561t,Enzemo,5,Sun Mar 15 20:11:26 2015 UTC,Could someone please explain to me why all crossfit gyms seem to have shitty walls?
instantbarbarians,2z561t,FindlayH,17,Sun Mar 15 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"they do a lot of shit that uses the environment of the gym such as wall balls, dropping weights like jack asses, generally being more concerned with the workout than anything else even their own safety....because it is functional...."
instantbarbarians,2z561t,Enzemo,11,Sun Mar 15 21:03:17 2015 UTC,"Oh I get it, they're assholes?"

instantbarbarians,2z561t,igneouz,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:02:48 2015 UTC,I saw that earlier and immediately thought ''definitely 'instant barbarians' material''
instantbarbarians,2z561t,NightO_Owl,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:16:29 2015 UTC,"If that was me, I would have shit myself on the way up. It would have been a very different reaction to the scream then."
instantbarbarians,2z561t,GSD_LOVER,3,Tue Mar 17 02:19:18 2015 UTC,WOW. That is pretty fucking impressive.
instantbarbarians,2z561t,Baby_venomm,2,Sun Mar 15 19:52:31 2015 UTC,No it's not
instantbarbarians,2z561t,bretstar,2,Tue Mar 31 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"Impressive.  Dude is huge, and he did it on rings."
instantbarbarians,2z561t,D_Ciaran,15,Sun Mar 15 18:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only that he didn't? He surely is very muscular but that isn't a muscle up. By definition he should have used his strength to get up there, not the inertia from swinging like a kid at the park."
instantbarbarians,2z561t,bretstar,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:22:06 2015 UTC,Tru.  I didn't even realize he was kipping so hard because of the rings.
