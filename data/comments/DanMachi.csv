DanMachi,3dmqgk,suade15,3,Fri Jul 17 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"The LN is going to be the most detailed adaptation of Danmachi, also it's the source. It's going to have better dialogue, descriptions, etc. tl;dr: gods got bored in heaven and wanted to play with children (humans). Immortality can be boring. Also, god can be sent back to heaven for various reasons. Don't think of it like SAO/Alicization. There is no ""real world"" equivalent like there is in SAO. Danmachi is a straight up fantasy setting world. Dungeon crawling as an adventurer is an occupation and death is very real. It's the reason why Eina doesn't want Bell to go too deep before he's at the appropriate level, etc. Hestia loves Bell, even in LN."

I know that it is, I'm asking if it elaborates more on that topic, and if so, is there anything major that it reveals about the world that is not really shown in the anime?  2.) Got it.  3.) It's just strange having us believe that this is not a game but using all mechanics and terminology that games use, specifically like series where the setting is in a game (SAO, Log Horizon, Overlord to name a few). I will keep suspending my disbelief, and I do enjoy it for what it but it's just very strange sight to behold. Like it wants us to believe that this is their actual world, and yet it chooses to sound like a MMO. Which makes it pretty unique. A real world that resonates with the mechanics of a video game, but actually isn't, I can't even wrap my head around that. I hope this makes sense.  4.) As in love love? Someone told me in the LN she isn't as crazy for Bell in the same sense, more like sisterly love.  Thanks for your input. :)"

But most probably nothing major will be concealed in manga/anime. Funfact: Anime surpassed manga in case of storyline.(Manga(Ch38:Fear) still at Minotaur fight in think)"

Without those tattoos, this would be a generic medieval fantasy world with some dungeon-related eccentricities. In the LN, this is explained as the gods playing a ""game"" where adventurers are their player characters, hence the tattoos' similarity to D&D character sheets. Gods can apparently cheat and break the game rules like when Hestia released her Goddess powers in Ep 12, but they risk getting sent back to Heaven if they do this.  (My theory for why Ottar is the only known level 7 is that Freya ignored the game rules and jacked his stats and level up as high as they'd go. It seems like the kind of thing she'd do.)  4) Yes, but her affections were way exaggerated in the anime."

I thought the ~150kb increase in filesize was well worth the larger resolution since the waterfall's movement is more easily seen this way.  Initially posted this on /r/animeplot, but I've always been a fan of posting in series-specific subs. First time posting here, been making gifs for a bit though. This is from episode 12 btw, but in this sub I'm preaching to the choir, no?  Haven't done a gif like this (auto-collaging) in a while.  40-frames of source. First used Auto-Align to make them all line up nicely, since the source was a panning shot going up. Then I went ahead and trimmed the canvas take off the excess.  Then I went ahead and made the soft-brush mask. Usually with a fade, I would wait until after the fade was done to make a mask, but with an auto-align gif, it's kind of necessary to do the mask first due to the jittering. The mask in this one is particularly close-cut.  Like I mentioned before, this is a fade. 20-frames means 5% increments.  After that was done, I went ahead and made a custom color palette focusing on the Sword Princess, since the default PS palettes were very white-heavy. Furthermore, since I knew I was going to use 0% dither beforehand, I wanted to make sure the focus of the gif (Aiz) wasn't going to have color-banding.  After all that, just did some double-checking to make sure it was all good.  Feel free to cross-post in other subs, I'm not at all touchy about who does what with my gifs; it's on the internet and the internet is free. Also, when I get my hands on a well encoded BD rip of the NCOP, I'll do the brushing gif (since the ones I've seen so far are... well... not that great).  Enjoy!"

DanMachi,3cii0n,YoureASquidNow,5,Wed Jul 8 04:17:22 2015 UTC,"Have you ever played Pokemon Mystery Dungeon? that's what I think this should be like. Every time you go in, the layouts of the floors are different. The safe-floors will all be the same number.   You'll have your own character, with their own build. Permadeath is the case, and death results in a full restart. It's an action RPG, with different moves and maneuvers taught by some NPCS, but can also be taught by players to players with adequate parameters. I think it'd have the online play of Dark Souls, where players would have to collab to fight Bosses and the like. PKing is possible, but you'd have to jump through hoops to enable it, and it'd have serious in-game consequences.  Your dungeoneer would start off without a familia, but could earn their way in to one through various questlines. Familia is permanent except for certain in-game circumstances, such as excommunication.  Magic is hard to get. Equipment is available to all who have the money for it, but it gets pricey. Skills are nigh impossible to roll, even under the specific circumstances required to trigger them.  I feel like this could really work. Combine the UI and gameplay of a more acrobatic dark souls, and put it in one of the Dungeons from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Hell, if such a game isn't out by the time Season 2's over, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a darksouls mod of this."

DanMachi,3bw9nh,MaplesyrupFTW,2,Fri Jul 3 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"i think they could have made a 26 episode series if they went to the end of volume 6. They would have been able to stretch the goliath fight to 2 episodes, added an episode or two to volume 4, fleshed out giving adventurers their titles, and in general not rushed everything. I'd say 13 episodes through the minotaur fight (which probably means you need to add one or two of the side stories), goliath fight ending episode 19-20 ish, then the remaining 6 episodes to go through volume 6."
DanMachi,3bw9nh,puffz0r,12,Wed Jul 8 13:20:12 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, but I've got a feeling the writers were as frustrated as you. There are some reasons episode 13 happened the way it did.   For starters, a lot of the confusing information that's thrown at you with no explanation is from the beginning of Volume 6 and expanded on later on the volume. Since the rest of the volume wasn't adapted (they couldn't fit it in 13 episodes), you're left hanging with a lot of loose plot threads that don't get resolved. Episode 13 was the first part of a longer story that simply was not told in the anime. JC Staff probably wanted to end the anime on a cool final boss fight, but the scene they were adapting was anything but in the source material. Rather than save most of their budget for the final episode, they spent the greatest portion on episode 8 - they even brought in a renowned animator to help with that episode. After that, the quality of animation dropped significantly. Notice how, earlier, when Bell fought the Minotaurs on the middle floors, some of them were obviously CG, and they didn't even animate their deaths -- just a still frame of an explosion as Argonaut goes off. This is a sad but unfortunate reality in the animation business. A lot of world-building was straight-up skipped, not only in the finale but earlier. Remember how, at the start of the episode, Hermes said ""the dungeon hates us?"" He's alluding to Hestia using her Goddess powers. Spawning nigh unbeatable foes like the Black Goliath is a self-defense measure by the dungeon to keep gods from going in and ""cheating."" That's actually a key difference between the anime and the LN: the anime never explains that Orario is, basically, a tabletop game world where adventurers are gods' ""player characters,"" and they all agreed to a bunch of game rules before they descended from heaven.    Yes, they could have done a much better job adapting the finale. I think they'd written themselves into a hole, ran short on time and money, and weren't sure how else to end the series. They probably could have ended it on episode 8 or even 12, but 13 episodes is the ""traditional"" season length for anime."
DanMachi,3bw9nh,dalecarnegiewasright,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"I still do not understand why it is a...""rule"" to end a season with something spectacular, especially when there's no time nor budget to make it happen. As I'm not in the industry, it is just my ignorant opinion that they should've put that fight in season 2, if there will be one, and extend something else to take up time, e.g. world building.  Quality dropped...? As the more interesting fights were more detailed (the gorilla early on, parts of the training with Aiz, the ""trained"" minotaur fight), I did not really perceive it as ""quality drop"" after the 8th episode, I merely noticed that said parts were important, and so, better animated than the rest. But when the last fight's animation was worse than the ""average"", well...yes, frustrating.  Well, maybe I will start reading the LNs, as I'm interested in the story now.  Thank you for clarifying stuff, it'll help getting over it. :)"
DanMachi,3bw9nh,JeTi_SNSD,5,Fri Jul 3 05:44:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen people say that anime adaptations are advertisements to sell the Light Novels they are based on and I think that definitely seems to fit for DanMachi.   They rushed out a bunch of cool fights and characters, left a ton of unanswered questions and left the audience wanting more.

DanMachi,3bw9nh,ckuri,3,Sun Jul 12 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"The new sword Bell got was the one that was shown Lilly found with the Loki familia logo. The final one-shot skill which Bell used was also ""Argonaut"" as seen by the light effect  and the sound effect (compare to episode 9 were thee was a small chime-like sound at activation) only that her he charged it for three minutes which increased the amount of the light and sound effects."
DanMachi,3bw9nh,ckuri,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"So it was of the Loki familia's. I see, still I do not understand THAT sword's importance. Well, doesn't really matter, I guess.  I know what bell used, but that's my...""problem"". That skill was used before, twice with the hand-glow effect, shooting a ""fire""...something, and once with a sword, again, only hands glowing.  Now his whole was gloving. It was obviously his skill, but different, and nobody said a word why it was different.  Also, I must've missed the sound of bell in previous episodes, as I don't remember it.  Anyway, thank you for the information."
DanMachi,3bw9nh,Clydeliit,3,Fri Jul 3 05:56:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think the sword was important - it was just a random item Lilly scraped together to help Bell.  Granted the details for argonaut were not explicitly explained. On the other hand, Hestia did mention that the argonaut skill scales with the danger so it's safe to assume that the (visual and acoustic) representation of the skill also scales accordingly, but I agree that it could have been done more transparently."
DanMachi,3bw9nh,aelric22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"I was confused, as Lily said something like ""This is..."" focusing on the sword for good seconds, like it bears any meaning, like I should know exactly what it is, and why it's good she found it. Like it has a story on its own.  I guess you are right about the argonaut, but I wonder, now that his whole body was brimming and stuff, how will they top it? It seemed like ""the grand finale"".  Add more glow maybe? :3"
DanMachi,3bw9nh,trollface66,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:28:16 2015 UTC,"Lilly was probably just surprised to see a Loki familia item which considering them must be pretty high-level.  As for the ultimate form of argonaut: dunno, maybe rainbow colors and full bell orchestra."

DanMachi,3bw9nh,Clydeliit,2,Wed Jul 8 10:09:37 2015 UTC,"This was a very bad way to end it for an anime as good as this one. It had a lot more potential. Sadly, this is the fate of many anime that are adapted from light novels, and we all know how true this is. This has happened to Spice and Wolf, Maoyu Maoyusha (correct my spelling if I'm wrong), and basically any other anime where they pass the manga as far as the point in the story. This is a very bad habit of the anime industry, where they simply just want to boost sales of the manga and light novel. I don't blame them, but they could do a lot more with the anime."

DanMachi,3br5ry,moragis,2,Wed Jul 1 14:22:44 2015 UTC,Well they could make each season 2-3 LN if they added more detail from them but they rushed through it IMO
DanMachi,3br5ry,Articlaus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Well the only reason the Anime is made was to Hype up the upcoming volumes and Sell more VOLUMES of the LN and the manga.

DanMachi,3bqlhn,VirusControl,6,Wed Jul 1 10:23:22 2015 UTC,"the dungeon goes down. its more or less a hole in the ground that leads into it.  the tower is built over the dungeon as a lid to keep monsters from coming out. (they did in the past before the tower is built)  the tower contains shops up to a certain level, then from there on are apartments for rich gods. (freya lives on the top floor)"
DanMachi,3bqlhn,MaplesyrupFTW,2,Wed Jul 1 11:06:47 2015 UTC,"first there was the dungeon, a hole in the ground with monsters coming out of it.  the mortals eventually fought back the roaming monsters, found their origin and built a tower as a lid (maybe 3-4 storeys)  the gods were pleased with this and came to check it out and hang with humans because they are interesting. turns out their aim was a little too perfect and crashed directly into the tower, destroying it.  the gods, apologetically rebuilt their tower albeit they want a little overkill. instead of just rebuilding it to the original spec, they designed it as a stupidly tall home for all gods and as a meeting place for them and humans. housing prices rose and now only rich gods get swanky apartments.  dungeon goes down, tower goes up. All of this is canon."
DanMachi,3bqlhn,montugar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:04:47 2015 UTC,"As said, the tower isn't the dungeon. The tower is housing gods, humans (probably, wasn't mentioned in the anime, was it?) shops and such,  The dungeon, on the other hand, is descending. The ""higher"" the floor level, the deeper it is. Imagine the level numbers as negative numbers, maybe that'll make more sense to you; -1, -2, -3, etcetera, etcetera."

I personally didn't watch the last episode of it yet, since i hate the moment, when an anime ends. (Yes, sounds weird xD)  But I'm looking forward to do. Also, depending on how the last episode goes, i guess there's a lot we havnt seen yet. For instance, i expected or prayed some more of a relationship between Aiz and Bell-kun. (Something alike SAO)  The only thing we may do, is, to keep our fingers cross and pray.   I'll surely have a look on animes which are similar to Danmachi, because these RPG styled animes really caught my attention :)  Anyways, have fun ( hope it wont take too long ~(°~°)~ ), and enjoy some other animes while you guys abd girls out there are waiting!"

DanMachi,3bftmo,JeffreyDS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"Got to agree that its set for a next season but most shows that are released have the same set up, it probably will be a while before S2 can be confirmed but then again it may not. No game no life did amazing on release and was set up the same but there is no chance for more anime seasons for the franchise, similar to spice and wolf there may never be a next season even with the fanbase and backing, but i would love to see more of bell and hestia but ive been spoiled by anime that makes going to manga feel like a step back.  As to fairy tail it had the continued support & funding from the weekly manga sales but over time it becomes less likely for the chance of a new season like k-on, super popular  but its been five years since release. all im trying to add is the no one can tell the future and your right we should enjoy the series we have now and whats comming"

DanMachi,3bfuxz,wolfpup118,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"I´d argue that I find it more interesting than the old pokémon. For instance, anything past the Orange Islands were bs, but in the newer episodes, they´ve really stepped up their production, writing and character progression. Unfortunately, Ash has his derp moments with his level 99999 pikachu losing to low-level pokémons, but its usually not without reason, like a new type pokemon or gym leader.  But to try and answer your question; is it like the old pokémon?  Kinda, they have good writers compared to previous seasons by far, the music and animation is beautiful and well made and the plot actually seems to move forward with character progression and development. The battles look crisp and sharp, allround something worth checking out. Just dont check out the season before the XY Anime unless you hate life and want to suffer."

AoBS was really fun, I would say I enjoyed it about as much as DanMachi and more consistently than SAO.

DanMachi,3beqkx,Elhami-,7,Sun Jun 28 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"Short, sharp answers that I believe were either in the anime or the Light Novels Vol 1 - 5 so not really spoilers.  Did Hestia ever pay Hephaestus back? Not yet, the weapon is worth millions so she will probably continue to work as a sales assistant for now.  What happened to the sword Welf dropped? In the finale (ep.13) Welf jumps into the forest during the incantation montage and retrieves the sword, he then releases all the magic power of it to perform Fire Moon.  What happened to the goddess that wanted to kill Hestia to take bell? Freya is still watching Bell from afar, I don't think she will outright kill Hestia but pushes the boundaries to help Bell reach his potential.  Who is she?(Freya?) Yes.  What is the reason Hermes went to save Bell? I don't think it has been fully revealed other than he also wants to see what Bell is capable of.  Did Lili actually leave her familia? Lili can't leave the Soma familia without buying her way out with a massive sum of money. Currently, they believe she died in the dungeon assuming the 3 that left her reported it.  Where does she live then? She lives with an old couple and occasionally helps them with their store.  What about her familia? the God of the Soma familia only cares about money to help fund his obsession making alcohol, you don't get status updates unless you provide a huge sum of money each week.  What happened to the Elephant mask familia? Many familias take a back seat in the anime while we focus on Hestia/Loki familias.  If Bell is Zeus adoptive grandson (since his blood grandfather died and gods can not die) why didn't Zeus let him join his familia? This hasn't really been covered yet, some very powerful familias either left Otario (sp) (main town with the dungeon) or were forced out for various reasons. We should find out more later.  How did they get out of the 18th floor? They had to kill the Black Goliath to allow them time to clear the avalanche that blocked the exit to the 17th floor. There wasn't time while it was on a rampage."
DanMachi,3beqkx,JeTi_SNSD,3,Sun Jun 28 16:16:42 2015 UTC,It has been revealed that Zues's familia was once the most powerful familia in Oratoria.  But their familia Challanged one of the Three End Game bosses (a black dragon) and it was fully wiped out.  The Loss of his famillia and his children took a huge toll on Zues and he went back to Heaven.
DanMachi,3beqkx,Articlaus,2,Mon Jun 29 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bell is Zeus' adoptive grandson, He never actually died, Bell was just told that he did. Zeus is currently not in orario (why he uses Hermes as a messanger) and therefore there is currently no Zeus familia (or the Hero's Familia). Since Zeus was so concentrated on Hero's joining his Familia, Bell was not allowed into Zeus' familia because Zeus thought ""Bell had no talent when it came to adventuring"", quite ironic I think xD. Also there were hints by Hermes' little speech at the end about Zeus and how he thought Bell wouldn't amount to much. In conclusion, Zeus is Bell's real grandfather, therefore Bell's father is literally the son of god :D, some Percy Jackson shit going down here <.<"
DanMachi,3beqkx,Jibril-san,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it all works currently, I believe there is more information about Zeus/Bell in LN 6.   I agree that Zeus probably didn't die and left for some other reason."

DanMachi,3beqkx,rainbow_tit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"Some of these are explained in the LN's that the series covered(notably, Freya stuff and Lili stuff).   Hestia we know is still working for paying back the knife(which is how she goes about learning more about Welf).   The sword Welf dropped is the one he uses to make the giant fireball.   Hermes(this is based on the anime since no full volume 5 translation) went after Bell because he heard he had set a new record for reaching level 2, and wanted to see for himself how strong bell was.   The grandfather who died was in fact the Zeus who was his adoptive grandfather. That's why Hermes knows the things he would say, because he knew Zeus. How he died I couldn't say, but if I recall correctly a god who dies simply returns to Heaven. Zeus was probably ready to go home and we know he didn't think Bell had it in him, so likely didn't find reason to come back down for one last person(again, mostly what I gathered from the storyline due to LN's not being translated)  With no more threat they would have been freely able to clear any debris away from the entrances."

DanMachi,3bcqxe,pizzaparty691,3,Sun Jun 28 00:29:46 2015 UTC,From the MAL DanMachi recs list I'd highly recommend Log Horizon and No Game No Life.
DanMachi,3bcqxe,jackjt8,2,Sun Jun 28 02:54:20 2015 UTC,Long horizon is really good once you pass 9 episodes or so.
DanMachi,3bcqxe,pizzaparty691,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:58:37 2015 UTC,First season was great. Second season felt a bit off to me.
DanMachi,3bcqxe,Roflstab,2,Sun Jun 28 09:46:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the kids part was kinda slow."
DanMachi,3bcqxe,Roflstab,2,Sun Jun 28 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"What genres are you into? Don't be shy to list as many as you want, no hate or judgement here"
DanMachi,3bcqxe,XxSIMSTERxX,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:48:03 2015 UTC,"Adventure, Action, Comedy, Some feels trip, Romance, Slice of Life, Ecchi. (Basically same as danmachi,sakurasou,SAO,tokyo g, AoT, yamada,Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai,) thats some genres i like. and thanks. :D"
DanMachi,3bcqxe,Roflstab,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"In terms of action, comedy, feels, slight ecchi and tonnes of fanservice, have you considered Fairy Tail?  Basic shounen, but it's my favourite series ever, nothing will change that. It's nowhere near as good as FMA:B or Hunter x Hunter 2011, but it's still my favourite.  On that note, if you want great action, slight comedy and huge feels, Hunter x Hunter 2011 is fucking godlike. It was an absolutely incredible journey. It starts off very slow and almost gives off a coming of age vibe, but once the story gets into Yorknew City... It gets brutal. The story is deceptively dark and very thought provoking although many die hard fans will tell you that the anime didn't do the manga enough justice, while I think Madhouse did the best they could. Definite 10/10 from me."
DanMachi,3bcqxe,Roflstab,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:14:22 2015 UTC,yea i was thinking about watching fairy tail too but i dont know which one to watch and hunter x hunter too. could you tell me which one to watch first? then the 2nd one. (for both the anime) and which one should i start first. Thanks! :D
DanMachi,3bcqxe,LylanDackey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:17:40 2015 UTC,Hunter x hunter first. Loved it. Don't be put off by the beginning though. It starts off very slow but once u make it past that it will become one of your fav ANIME of all time. The adventure and the build up is amazing and a really nice binge watch.
DanMachi,3bcqxe,jackjt8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:34:57 2015 UTC,Yea hunter x hunter is superrrrr underrated from what i heard.
DanMachi,3bcqxe,Fakawat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Well you can start Fairy Tail from episode 1, they change animation studios later on in the series but it's all the same show.  You want to watch Hunter x Hunter 2011, the remake by Madhouse.  I'd honestly suggest starting Fairy Tail first, it's much more light hearted and I had a total blast starting it."

DanMachi,3b9etg,kutturkuttur,2,Sat Jun 27 01:54:54 2015 UTC,how long is a usual volume
DanMachi,3b9etg,Xx255q,2,Sat Jun 27 04:09:14 2015 UTC,100-200 pages

DanMachi,3b9etg,Xx255q,2,Sat Jun 27 04:44:48 2015 UTC,Thats good for us fans though! That means more content and potentially enough story to make a season 2
DanMachi,3b9etg,crazytaco_,2,Sat Jun 27 04:48:27 2015 UTC,"good thing that boob ribbon is so popular, could also help get a second season"
DanMachi,3b9etg,Xx255q,-2,Sat Jun 27 04:56:01 2015 UTC,thats the light novel.  the anime past the manga a while ago
DanMachi,3b9etg,MaplesyrupFTW,3,Sat Jun 27 02:11:27 2015 UTC,You gotta read the LN's now. The show was based off the Light Novel's not the manga
DanMachi,3b9etg,crazytaco_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:24:28 2015 UTC,Where can i get a translated version of them?
DanMachi,3b9etg,cincmincV2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"well theres not much reason to read through 1-5 (unless you want some more backstory into characters) because the anime covers those volumes. And volume 6-8 haven't been officially translated yet (and might not be for a long time) so there's only fan translations which are hard to find because of copyright issues....so yeah, my suggestion is to find a couple new animes to hold you over until the translations come out or the new season comes out (hopefully within the next two years)"
DanMachi,3b9etg,crazytaco_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:34:53 2015 UTC,I don't think they planned this well. Do they not care about international markets?
DanMachi,3b788f,Just_A_Djoker,3,Fri Jun 26 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"I can't answer much about the light novels, but I do know that with Danmachi's surprisingly high popularity (Hestia playing a big part in that), its very very likely there'll be more seasons. I wouldn't expect it until next year at the earliest though. I hear the light novel sales shot up because of renewed interest when the anime started airing.   I've seen Log Horizon, SAO and Accel World.   Of these:   Sword Art Online is definitely worth a watch. Its not so much that it drops off after the first arc (it really depends on your tastes), its more that the tone of the anime changes quite strongly. The beginning of the first season and the first half of the second season are both excellent though (the rest being ""good"" lol). Accel World is awesome, but it gets a bad rap in my opinion because the protagonist is so out of the ordinary. Instead of a headstrong, impulsive fighter or a Sasuke Uchiha style lone wolf, hes a chubby, inexperienced kid (though his avatar in his game isn't). It's a little hard to describe the game from this anime, though. Definitely worth watching. Log Horizon is my favourite of the three. The main character is a genius otaku type, and the story is about rebuilding their lives inside the RPG they get stuck in, more than trying to get out. I can't really reveal much more because spoilers. Its a lot of fun to watch, but even though there is some action, its less action heavy than the other two.    Other ones include No Game No Life, which is fantastic, if you can look past the weirdly close relationship between the two main characters, and .hack, which I personally haven't seen much of (its pretty old - 2002), but I've heard good things.  Haha I definitely love this genre too."
DanMachi,3b788f,MarioCanFly,2,Sat Jun 27 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"Very likely, is being quite popular here in Japan (despite the been broadcast at 1:05AM~), and the vols 6 to 8 are already published, so there is still plenty to cover. But there is no official anuncement yet, as far as I know.  The light novels have been only unnofficially translated up to Vol.5 ch.1 so far, so the anime have overpassed them in the main plot, but the LN have more details than the anime.  Is not exactly the same style, but the anime that will fill the gap of Danmachi in Tokyo MX 1 (23:30~) is ""Gate - Thus the JSDF Fought There!"" (Geito - Jieitai Karenochinite Kakutatakaeri), that is a mix of fantasy and real world. The manga looks really nice and the anime starts 3rd of July."

I have an unrelated question:  how likely is it that Nanatsu no Taizai will get a second season any time soon?  I've heard rumors about one happening in Fall but haven't seen anything official yet.  I do, however, know that the anime boosted the manga's popularity tremendously (I am up to date on the manga). I don't know if you follow the anime or manga, but either way, how popular is the manga right now, and is it basically a given that season 2 is going to happen at some point?"

And while they might all be similar, but not the same, DanMachi takes the top place in my book.  From what i've heard, the Anime brought great popularity to the LNs, so there's a greater than chance possibility that there may be a second season in the future. However, i'm not really sure if there's enough LN material atm to make a second season."
DanMachi,3b788f,isaiahexe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"If you know about its LNs (I don't), then figure it out! :3 You'd need to know how much of the existing LN material the season used. If it's less than half, and if it was popular (seemingly it was), then the likelihood of a second season is high.  Though...the 13th episode disappointed me, it was so rushed it almost felt like a wrapping-up, because of a declined 2nd season or something."
DanMachi,3b788f,JediFerrari,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"I can't say anything about Log Horizon, but I've seen the entirity of Accel World, both seasons of SAO, and DanMachi (I call it by its english name, but lets ignore that). I don't think i have a favorite, because while they are similar, they each have they're strong suits, Accel World being the most different of the three. Accel World is really good, but it doesn't have a season 2 (which dissapointed me). It's probibly the most strange, which I like, and more action vs plot (though plot takes a huge role). SAO 1 is good, but starts to get a little dull towards the end. Really good overall. SAO 2's first half is extremely good, especially towards the end, but the second half is basically a side story. I've heard that SAO 3 is the biggest and most intense arc of the entire series, so I'm really excited for it.  Really, I'd reccomend you watch all three if you have the time."
DanMachi,3b788f,wtrmlnjuc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen all of SAO, but I guess contrary to vocal opinion I've been a huge fan of all of its arcs. When watching this show, some of the scenes actually gave me that same gripping, edge of your seat feeling that some scenes in the first arc of SAO gave me. I don't think you'll have to worry about dropping it.   As for Accel World, I did get exactly ten episodes in before it become my first and only anime I've dropped so far.   I can't really give you hard answers but I hope my experience helps shed a little more light on the subject."

DanMachi,3ak9ul,AceTrigger94,11,Sun Jun 21 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Other than the fact that they are both harems and are based in a video game-esque world I would say not much. The situations are completely different. The motivations for the characters are completely different. Other than a few tropes being shared between the two I don't think they are that similar at all. Danmachi is more of an Adventure than a Romance. And SAO was about the romance more than the adventure in its earlier stages.  I wouldn't put it past the author of Danmachi to have taken some inspiration from SAO, but I feel like the two stories are different enough that its not really a big deal. Danmachi is very different from SAO, even just looking at how the world is set up. Its not a death trap game, its real life for them, and being an adventurer is basically just another job."
DanMachi,3ak9ul,SnypeUXD,3,Sun Jun 21 01:19:13 2015 UTC,video game-esque   I'd say more DnD/table top than anything else. Hell you have to do leveling up after your adventure with your god/dm.   But yeah I pretty much agree with you though. They're both just harem/fantasy/adventure anime with a fuck ton of fan service.   Also a female lead in both use a sword. And both have a tower.
DanMachi,3ak9ul,Ralmaelvonkzar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:19:02 2015 UTC,"I really like the leveling up aspect, especially since I'm now playing DnD. A world where you level up...sounds fun!"
DanMachi,3ak9ul,for_ffxiv_sake,4,Sat Jun 27 07:28:02 2015 UTC,It's easy to think the two are the same because the worlds are so similar. (Stats+dungeons+fantasy world = video game) but there's one major difference that makes the two premises completely different.  Danmachi is a show about fantastic characters in a fantastic world.  SAO is a show about mundane characters learning to live in a fantastic world.

DanMachi,3ak9ul,kidstandout,-1,Sun Jun 21 02:58:08 2015 UTC,danmachi isn't about nerd empowerment. danmachi is about a fantasy world. sao is about a nerd who is good at video games.
DanMachi,3afsqx,Cunnilingusmon,8,Fri Jun 19 19:58:33 2015 UTC,Best part was only Lili objected. Bell got it made.

DanMachi,3afkam,Jaynight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:52:11 2015 UTC,Is there a schedule for each chapter's release date?
DanMachi,3afkam,Waddlachop,3,Fri Jun 19 18:57:58 2015 UTC,2 Chapters are released in Japan each month. I assume bi-weekly. You can expect the translations to follow shortly after the the release as Danmachi seems high on Onetimescans project list.  You can probably find more info on their website
DanMachi,3afkam,6six7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"The problem that I have with the manga is its gonna take like 30+ chapters in order for us to get past the anime, which is like 12-15 months, and I hate waiting that long as well as fear that people will stop translations since IDK if it will still be popular that time, unless we get like a season 2 next year."
DanMachi,3afkam,chaosfire235,2,Sat Jun 20 02:52:01 2015 UTC,I think we will get a second season. It will just be awhile because I believe they have exhausted the source material (LN)   On the plus side the official Yen Press releases of the LN should catch up fairly quickly and then stay caught up.
DanMachi,3af5ra,Cunnilingusmon,12,Fri Jun 19 17:02:07 2015 UTC,Aiz's reaction is priceless
DanMachi,3af5ra,MegaGMan,12,Fri Jun 19 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"oh Hermes, you're such an asshole.  as if peeping in the baths wasnt enough, you hire thugs to sic on Bell.  respect, lost."
DanMachi,3af5ra,Lothul1212,5,Fri Jun 19 19:16:40 2015 UTC,When that titan fall from somewhere I was like OMFG! Maybe the reason that gods can't enter in dungeons is that if they unleash their power they attract upper monsters or something? :D
DanMachi,3af5ra,Thmsly,3,Fri Jun 19 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"As it was explained to me, the dungeon reacts to the adventurers in it. So far we've only seen what bosses will spawn with the standard party, but now that Bell has 2 gods with him the LN's? spawned right on top of their now huge party."
DanMachi,3af5ra,6six7,4,Fri Jun 19 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"when bell saw aiz naked and was running it looked like aiz was planning on sticking her hand out as to say wait where are you going, plus she was the only one blushing? :)"
DanMachi,3af5ra,Level1Otaku,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:23 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be so shattered when it ends next week.

Can't wait for next season!!!!!!!!"
DanMachi,3af5ra,Thmsly,5,Sat Jun 20 09:17:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard alot of rumors about there not being a second season. Mostly because they busted through 5/8 of the LNs in one season. I'm in the camp that thinks money will speak louder than contracts, but just know if there is a second season it will either be very slow paced, or full of filler."
DanMachi,3af5ra,Dream_Vegas,2,Sat Jun 20 19:51:45 2015 UTC,Well if it does happen we have to ask a question. What's more entertaining to us? Filler or having things take their time?

DanMachi,3af5ra,Chornax,3,Fri Jun 19 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"Judging by the big ass monster that appeared when she did use it I'm guessing there is clearly a side affect to doing so, most likely they don't use it unless its life threatening or gonna hurt Bell-kun."
DanMachi,3af5ra,geelongminer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:37:59 2015 UTC,"My guess: Its a punishment of using her divine powers, considering they gave up using their powers to live in the Lower World. Some god/judge who has come for her."

DanMachi,3acpg4,KritoKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:50:09 2015 UTC,Nothing has been announced yet. We're still waiting but judging by the popularity it has gotten I'd guess there will be a dub and a season 2.
DanMachi,3abh7o,6six7,4,Thu Jun 18 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"I think she cares for bell. In the latest anime episode, there is a scene, where hestia asks bell ""you don't like sweaty girls, right ?"" or something like that, and aiz starts to smelling herself"
DanMachi,3abh7o,nrshine,3,Fri Jun 19 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"I started laughing at that, she's just in the background trying to learn what he likes."

If anything I think it will be Hestia. She's the 2nd ""main"" character, and the closest to Bell, also kinda saved him, and as she said, she loves him."
DanMachi,3abh7o,Somzer,2,Fri Jul 3 07:02:46 2015 UTC,"dxd is a true harem, it's actually one of the best harems.  i agree that hestia should get him, but light novel also hypes up aiz"

DanMachi,3abh7o,tuxshake,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:26:36 2015 UTC,"This is so much fan service, like the non caring girl who the protagonist is in love with is secretly in love with him and building him up to be all he can be, then and only then will she openly love him. God damn it this is so bad it's good."
DanMachi,3abh7o,LylanDackey,8,Thu Jun 18 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"Except we don't know if she is or not. From every indication in the LN and the anime, the only thing she cares about is how he got so strong. It's possible she's using these actions as an angle to get Bell to spill the beans on how he leveled up so quickly."
DanMachi,3abh7o,MakutaArguilleres,2,Fri Jun 19 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said but the topic of why she is interested in him based on power and or romantically goes both ways, because in the sword orato side story of her perspective, chapter 6 I believe she went shopping with tione, and she suddenly ended up looking at a wedding dress. Then she has a conversation with tione about tione's love interest in their captain(finn) and tione ask aiz if getting stronger was her only goal, then aiz thought of bell and she stated in her mind that there is a stronger feeling inside her than her desire to get stronger/level up, and she responded to tione by saying she might have felt a little of what tione felt when tione was with the captin, which implies she has slight romantic feelings for bell as she was thinking of him when she said that. TBH we all just have to wait and see how strong bell gets and hows aiz reacts to this and what other situations come up between aiz and bell, since there are different viewpoints from, the light novels, side stories and mangas/anime. I just hope the anime gets a second season with 24 episodes because they can fill some plotholes since they skipped some stuff this season, plus they have a shitload of material if they do decide to do another season. But i think it'll work out if they go that route;casue I wanna see bell dancing with aiz :) which happned in volume 6 of the L/N"
DanMachi,3abh7o,MakutaArguilleres,2,Fri Jun 19 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well, shit hits the fan in Volume 6, and from that we learn more of Aiz's motivations."
DanMachi,3abh7o,MakutaArguilleres,2,Fri Jun 19 04:07:14 2015 UTC,What do you mean by aiz's motivation? Be more specific since I only read a summary of the volume and not the exact thing since its in japanese.
DanMachi,3abh7o,SuperWolf,2,Fri Jun 19 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't learn her motives directly, a lot of it is implied. In Vol 6"
DanMachi,3abh7o,MakutaArguilleres,2,Fri Jun 19 14:48:56 2015 UTC,How much further ahead is the LN?
DanMachi,3abh7o,AstonishingSpiderMan,2,Fri Jun 19 16:47:19 2015 UTC,Volume 8 now. The anime is ending on volume 5.

DanMachi,3abh7o,AstonishingSpiderMan,0,Fri Jun 19 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"Guys we really need a season 2 of anime which would cover bell and aiz dancing, although she was kinda forced into it by hermes."
DanMachi,3abh7o,AstonishingSpiderMan,-3,Sun Jun 21 06:05:01 2015 UTC,"Nah I dont, she doesn't seem to care for him just how he got so strong so quickly. I ship that 12 year old with his Goddess Hestia."
DanMachi,3abh7o,geelongminer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"Like I said it goes both ways. There were instances where I thought that, and there were instances where her action/thoughts(manga) led me to believe she has feelings for him romantically as well. IMO hestia is used mainly for comedic relief, which gets annoying sometimes. I mean he blushes more when in the presence of aiz as oppose to hestia; he only blushes with hestia when she forcefully puts him in an uncomfortable position, which all guys would do if you've got boobs in your face. But when he see's aiz he gets nervous and stuff. In the light novel volume 6 hestia confessed to bell and bell responded by saying he has nothing but respect for her, otherwise he would have confessed as well or gave a hint that he loves her as a future partner rather than someone like a sister."
DanMachi,3abh7o,AstonishingSpiderMan,-3,Fri Jun 19 14:05:50 2015 UTC,I'll cut him some slack he's 12.
DanMachi,3abh7o,AstonishingSpiderMan,4,Fri Jun 19 14:09:44 2015 UTC,haha he is 14
DanMachi,3abh7o,kidstandout,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"He's still in that lust mode, iirc he began liking Aiz because she was crazy strong and thought she was beautiful but she only interested in his power which iirc was a power given by Hestia."
DanMachi,3abh7o,kidstandout,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:57:52 2015 UTC,hestia is just fanservice and a damsel in distress (with exceptions such as the latest episode) and is just there to get in the way of Bell even slightly starting a conversation with a girl.  Then again anti-Hestia's apparently aren't allowed on this sub so \o/
DanMachi,3abh7o,geelongminer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:13:41 2015 UTC,That still doesn't answer why bell likes aiz
DanMachi,3abh7o,kidstandout,2,Sat Jun 20 12:26:11 2015 UTC,"You've already answered that. She is strong and beautiful. Bell is trying to get stronger so he can stand beside her. But based on the L/n without even realizing it, aiz is beginning to change because of bell, also I wonder what she will do when she finds out about his ability/secret to leveling up so fast(which is love, although its not explicitly stated his LOVE for aiz, but we can imply that)"

DanMachi,39v3kk,xSoft1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:29:00 2015 UTC,I'm guessing there is a certain prestige to being the first person at an anime car show/gathering with the more popular characters from the airing season.   It's not like it's completely permanent if you have the disposable income to burn and the character doesn't stay popular.  Tattoos on the other hand of an airing show character would be going too far for me. :P

DanMachi,39nj8l,JeTi_SNSD,4,Sat Jun 13 00:43:41 2015 UTC,The anime passed the manga a few episodes ago.   The training was in town when Bell was getting knocked out over and over by Aiz in the anime.

DanMachi,39lnid,Ralmaelvonkzar,5,Sat Jun 13 05:51:00 2015 UTC,Well it's a high level party so they've probably seen enough shit to stop caring. That and they knew about what Bell's party just went through so probably made the assumption that Hestia was anxious enough to break the rules.  Do the LN's explain more about why they can't go in or the punishments involved?
DanMachi,39lnid,Reikakou,2,Sat Jun 13 06:39:52 2015 UTC,Wonder how Hestia's group even crossed the giant. Run mad like no tomorrow like what Bell did?  Damn carrying those two must have improve Bell's STR and END stats.

DanMachi,39lnid,kidstandout,6,Sun Jun 14 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"so let me get this straight; it's okay for lily to cockblock hestia but when hestia does the same thing to aiz, that's where people draw the line? where was this outcry when hestia got cockblocked by the army of horny goddesses? this is the problem with fans of harem series; people become bias haters of anyone who cockblocks their best girl(looks at you asia dxd haters) despite all of them being guilty of the same thing. i don't see anyone hating on the two tan amazons, but hey lets slag the loli goddesss for being overprotective of the boy she's been supporting since day 1.  moving on, ryu put in some work.  not sure if golliath or titan  run forrest bell-kun run!  aiz kun for the save. you may have the personality of a cardboard box, but you're adorable nonetheless. plus it also helps that your a BAMF. i see you trying to listen in on bell kuns skills lol  the amazon twins was laying it on pretty thick.  welf snatchin the food from lili was hilarious  welf and hephaestus have a history? a new ship sets sale!  8.5/10 this week. sucks only two more episodes remain"
DanMachi,39lnid,Xcelentei,7,Sat Jun 13 01:38:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a bit of a double standard, but remember that we're watching the show from Bell's perspective. Lili and Hestia fighting over Bell is comical when we see it because it's just two girls fighting over an oblivious guy, but here she was interrupting a moment Bell had with the girl he's actually interested in. I'm not saying it's right or fair, but from Bell's point of view the two scenarios are completely different."
DanMachi,39lnid,kidstandout,2,Sat Jun 13 01:56:27 2015 UTC,"it's not so much that the girl being cockblocked is the one he is interested in (aiz may not be the only one. his perspective on hestia is slowly changing, though i wont spoil how that escalates in volume 6), but that the girl being cockblocked is even denser than the guy, so people are quick to pity her."
DanMachi,39lnid,Reikakou,2,Sat Jun 13 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"Haha! So my gut feel was right about the Sword Princess, Aiz is much denser than Bell.  Probably Ichika-level of density at that. Poor Bell. He will not be able to confess to her until he reaches level 7 then. So that's like, forever."
DanMachi,39lnid,Grim027,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:13:26 2015 UTC,"Hestia's jealousy is always used for comic relief though and it's always excessive compared to the others. Bell's perspective of her didn't really change too.  Lili stopped a touching reunion between her and Bell while Hestia jumped in so that they would not have adate, Hestia did the same thing in the first arc and dragged him when he was only looking for Syr, she's too possessive. The amazons are also not in the harem,Spoiler"
DanMachi,39lnid,kidstandout,2,Sat Jun 13 07:44:04 2015 UTC,"no it wasnt, in the very first episode she was genuinely concerned that bell was progressing because of someone else. the whole reason she had hephaestus make the knife for him was because she was sick of being of no help to him. her jeolousy is really fear of losing the first person who believed in her which made her fall in love with him  his perspective of her definitely did change in volume 6, but that wont be in the anime.  it's a harem anime, singling out hestia for being 'possessive' is outright hypocritical. you yourself just admited that lili did the exact same thing. one hardly blame her for cockblocking when her own date with bell was cockbolcked by all of olympus"
DanMachi,39lnid,Grim027,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it's possible to deny that she's excessively jealous compared to the others like Lili and Syr, Lili's jealousy is displayed mainly when Hestia tries something, with the others she's not the same. I am not saying that she's not doing her best for him but she is possessive, extremely jealous and childish when it comes to Bell. She fell for him because of his purity, that's in volume 2, it's not because he was the first one to believe in her. She was stalking him when he was looking for a familia and asked him to join since he was alone and he accepted, that's all. Hestia had no followers for a simple and believable reason, she came after many other gods, had nothing to offer and had a place to live thanks to Hephaestus. I compared the two events, Lili interrupted a their reunion, but in the end they still reunited, what Hestia interrupted was the occasion for Bell to have a date with the girl he likes, that's very different. About volume 6, Spoiler"
DanMachi,39lnid,kidstandout,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"when hestia's screentime outweighs the other significantly, of course its going to appear that way.  there's no denying that she fell for his purity, but the fact that he did give her a shot when no one else did for all the reasons you mentioned definitely is of value to her.  a heartfealt reunion and a date are really that different to you? both of those lead to shipping development, same goal different method. the purpose of the former wasnt just reuniting.  Spoiler  all i'm saying is that when something as excessive as that happens to hestia, people turn a blind eye to it. she has her moments of being excessive but she is not the only one. remember what happened on her date?"
DanMachi,39lnid,Cheebasaur,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Because Aiz is the girl Bell wants. People vote for waifu's but the character's ambitions and goals remain the same in LN and Anime.

It kinda makes sense as it somewhat works out in reality, and can be exploited to provide fanservice too.  Embarrassment is a human thing, she likes Bell, and by touching her ears Bell ""makes her feel good"" which often embarasses people, so again it kinda makes sense.  Just my 2 cents."

DanMachi,39381z,tonywow,6,Mon Jun 8 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"Sword of Oratoria (spin-off) vol 1-3 are rather boring but vol 4 is really interesting due to Bell's training with Aiz as seen from Aiz perspective (she purposely knocks him out again and again since she enjoys leg-pillowing him so much) and Loki familia's exploit in the deepest reached part of the dungeon (what an epic battle !).  It's not only Aiz that got motivated by Bell's fight with the red minotaur, other main members of Loki familia are also motivated too. There are those that started looking upon Bell as rival and there are those that started getting 'interested' in him, beside Aiz herself.   Things are also getting more interesting as the mystery to Aiz's past deepens. Loki, Finne, Riveria and Gareth are the only ones who know about Aiz's past and even they themselves do not know everything about it. The answer lies in the deeper parts of the dungeon.  I don't think that Aiz's and Bell's journey will separate in the incoming volumes as there will be more and more interaction between Hestia, Loki, Freja, and other familias.   Without spoilers, I think that's all I can say :)"

DanMachi,38tsmz,Jaynight,2,Sat Jun 6 19:56:11 2015 UTC,Lots is getting cut from the LN. Its probably because they were not sure how well the anime would sell so they wanted to cover as much content as possible. It seems they really shot their selves in the foot as result.

DanMachi,38qjn0,TheAceTea,6,Fri Jun 5 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"That's the way it should be. They shouldn't be adapting Vol.6, that's S2 material."
DanMachi,38qjn0,AceTrigger94,2,Sat Jun 6 02:38:56 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Volume 6 starts up a storyline that there is no way that it should be animated just yet. And since this is J.C. Staff, waiting for a year or so is nothing for them (Shana, Familiar of Zero and Index), which would work in the favour of getting more content for the next season.   Also, 24-26 episodes would be awesome to have for a subsequent season."
DanMachi,38qjn0,CaRoss11,3,Sat Jun 6 04:45:27 2015 UTC,"If there is a second season, they need slow down the pacing so that they can more faithfully adapt the light novels. This could help them stretch a 13 episode season into 26. I mean the series is popular so hopefully it encourages them to do this."
DanMachi,38qjn0,CaRoss11,2,Sat Jun 6 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yes they do. When they covered all of volume 4 in a single episode, I knew that there was some severe pacing issues (pushing the conversation between Hestia and Eina over taking advantage of Bell through her position from the first three episodes to episode 4 was another major example)."
DanMachi,38qjn0,etibbs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:36:03 2015 UTC,I would disagree with you on that being a pacing issue. Volume 4 was a pacing problem since they kind of glanced over that entire LN but a pace of 3 or 4 episodes per LN is about what it should be. If you took 5 volumes of the LN and tried to turn it into a 24-26 episode series it is very possible it would suffer from feeling sluggish.
DanMachi,38qjn0,CaRoss11,2,Mon Jun 8 00:04:16 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Even Mahouka, which turned a single novel into 7 episodes, still suffered from being slightly sluggish despite avoiding a lot of the pitfalls that light novel adaptations suffer. So I understand what you mean there.   However, I do offer the counter that if the series was to be a 24-26 episode adaptation, then I would have hoped that they would include volumes 6 and 7 in there as well. With those two, on top of the first five, there would have been enough content."
DanMachi,38qjn0,etibbs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:58:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I could agree with that.

DanMachi,38gqu2,RandomGibbon,6,Thu Jun 4 02:36:54 2015 UTC,Isn't that the point of most animes though? To advertise the light novel/manga?
DanMachi,38gqu2,RandomGibbon,3,Thu Jun 4 15:43:27 2015 UTC,Yeah but the anime didn't start airing until April 2015 and these statistics were taken from November 2014 to May 2015. The anime definitely helped to increase sales but I would like to think that they were more influenced by DanMachi's own increasing popularity. The main point is that the franchise seems to be growing well and is experiencing success. This can lead to the creation of more DanMachi related material such as a second season for it's anime.
DanMachi,38gqu2,Ralmaelvonkzar,4,Thu Jun 4 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I hope it continues to grow, I'm really loving the anime so far. I guess I should get the light novels at some point."

DanMachi,38go14,TheAceTea,2,Thu Jun 4 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not too knowledgeable on this subject, but what I think is that the DanMachi anime is not necessarily based off of the manga per say but off of the light novels that the manga itself is based off. Which is why this anime can pass the manga without making any content up. This is just my assumption btw there could very well be a deeper meaning to it."
DanMachi,38go14,jehcee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:53:25 2015 UTC,I did the exact same as you yesterday and as far as I know the anime just orientates on the Light Novel.

DanMachi,3896qk,angryspacemahreen,15,Tue Jun 2 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"Popularity actually can determine whether there's another season. Log Horizon is a perfect example, especially as there was only a couple of volumes left over when the first season ended, and they managed to make another full 2 cour season of Log Horizon with the blessing of the original creator.   Also, this is a J.C. Staff series, and they are known for waiting in between seasons. Even if we don't get another season right away, I think that this series has proven popular, and monetarily productive, enough to justify a subsequent season. I mean, there were a couple years between seasons of Shana and Familiar of Zero after all (and that's without delving into the gaps between Index seasons).   Also, as to the pacing, I'm not sure if they'll actually go all the way into volume 6 with the episodes. Unless they are planning on a subsequent season, it would be a terrible idea to start up the storylines that occur in volume 6 if there's no plans for a continuation.   Granted, until official word is given one way or another, I doubt there's any need to be negative about it though."
DanMachi,3896qk,CaRoss11,-6,Tue Jun 2 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Log horizon 2 is not the example i would use as that was mediocre. Forget that the content was blah, the pacing was terrible and the deen animation was aids."
DanMachi,3896qk,kidstandout,4,Wed Jun 3 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"What happened with Log Horizon 2 is a disappointment for sure, but it still holds true that a popular series can lead to subsequent seasons no matter how few novels there are left to adapt. Thankfully, in this case, we may actually have 3 - 5 novels worth of content if they wait until next year to air it. And J.C. Staff does tend to be the ones to continue series that they've started."
DanMachi,3896qk,CaRoss11,0,Wed Jun 3 20:52:20 2015 UTC,I guess. Hopefully danmachi goes a different route as to how they accomplish this
DanMachi,3896qk,kidstandout,2,Wed Jun 3 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"Sad that you were downvoted, but so very, very true. I quit watching after the first or second episode because I just completely lost interest in everything that was going on."

DanMachi,3896qk,Cheebasaur,-1,Wed Jun 3 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll sell a lot of figures and pillows, but if there's no second season focused on the plot, the anime won't transcend and will be forgotten.  Don't mistake me, I actually enjoyed the anime, but it makes me feel they could've pulled out more if they omitted Hestia's tease; Lili's issue also took too much time for a secondary character, and other silly stuff I can't recall at this moment.  I think they focused more on the fanservice rather than the plot itself, they want to sell merchandising and DVDs/BRs right now, which happens a lot in anime nowadays, and it personally bothers me, a lot.   Anime can be more profitable if done right, like Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Full Metal Alchemist. Do you think anybody will remember or buy merchandising from this new wave of fanservice anime in 5 years? I don't think so, and I'm pretty sure it's already decided that there won't be a S2 of Danmachi."

I would be fine if they at least confirmed a 2nd season to be released at a later date and then let the anticipation build up while Fujino Omori finishes more volumes. Take Attack on Titan for example, Season 2 is still on the way maybe DanMachi might follow a similar path.  Pace the anime the second time round rather than stretch everything to fill the episodes."

DanMachi,37tlrn,SplitCatapolt,1 point,Sat May 30 16:49:14 2015 UTC,I believe there are 8 LN's out in Japan and the Anime is running for 13  episodes. So they have covered 4 LN's in 9 episodes.   I hope they don't rush out 4 more LN's in 4 episodes to try and wrap it up. I would guess LN 5 + 6 if there isn't too much action or just LN 5 if they have some battles to animate.
DanMachi,37tlrn,JeTi_SNSD,1 point,Sat May 30 23:08:41 2015 UTC,"From skimming over the information on the DanMachi wiki, I have a feeling they'll just get to the end of volume 5.

He want's to be considered a friend, someone to be relied on and for him to rely on them just as much.   It's a two way road for him. The fact that he's willing to put up just as much as he'd ask for shows that he has great character.  That's what made me immediately like the guy."

DanMachi,37qu04,Reikakou,1 point,Fri May 29 18:43:19 2015 UTC,Yep. I was actually excited that Bell was about to get a new armor only to be disappointed later. Only the wrist part was changed the most.

Its a term used to call someone inexperienced or a baby. Sounds like little rookie to me.  Maru is a circle, revenge is inherently circular. What comes around goes around.  What do you think?"

I was  really looking forward to watching the advisor elf's disbelief past the initial shock as well as him picking his lvl 2 perk and the gods meeting. I highly recommend this that like this anime read the ln for this portion.
DanMachi,37qu04,danny0015,2,Sat May 30 02:24:47 2015 UTC,So can anyone spoil me with how good his new weapon is ?? And what are the restriction on argonaut spell seems too op if he can use it all the time

DanMachi,37ppc5,AuspexNA,8,Fri May 29 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"We'll probably get another cour later this year or early on next due to its popularity, but if its pacing is similar to the current one, there wont be enough source material for anything past that. To elaborate, in the next month or so there will be eight volumes of Danmachi's light novel available. The first season covers four volumes while a second season would likely cover another four. At that point there isn't any material left to base the show off of. So realistically, we'd only see 24 episodes total of Danmachi in the best case scenario unless the studio working on the series adapted only a volume per season which is highly unlikely and would make for a very shitty show.  tl;dr  We'll probably only have 24 episodes of Danmachi in total at best if they decide to do another season since there isn't enough source material for anything past that."
DanMachi,37ppc5,-tuhbakee-,1 point,Fri May 29 13:46:35 2015 UTC,Could be one of those long term shows that get a season every 1-3 years to keep up with the manga.

DanMachi,37ppc5,Cheebasaur,1 point,Fri May 29 21:25:46 2015 UTC,Could take a while. It seems the first season may actually cover volume 5 and now possibly 6. It's anyone's guess at this point.
DanMachi,37ppc5,-tuhbakee-,2,Fri May 29 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"This may be a case where they may redo it. I don't think anyone was expecting it to be a popular as it is, and it certainly warrants going back to the start and doing it right, because the anime is honest-to-god too fucking fast.   EDIT: Based upon the latest episode, it is clear we are not getting another season. They are trying to cover as much as they can and advertise for the LN. Even if this show is amazingly popular, there's no legitimate way it can get a second season in this state, because it will finish up to volume 6 at this rate."

Same generation as Zeus, Hera, etc. I'm not far enough into the LNs to know if this stays true in the story, but it should."
DanMachi,37fi9a,LylanDackey,4,Wed May 27 07:37:52 2015 UTC,"In Mythology, Hestia was one of the original Children of Kronos and Rhea. She also happened to be the oldest, and ticked the titans off that their children, the gods, were on a different level.  Hestia is a personal favorite because she doesn't participate in all of the God's pettiness. She abdicated her seat on Olympus when Dionusus came along, to prevent fighting. She was also a kind of support group to whoever needed someone to talk to, listening to the Other God's problems and offering advice, without antagonizing anyone. Her main goal is getting the rest of Olympus to chill out, relax, and be a family.  Basically she's the embodiment of ""welcome home."" She doesn't have any elemental or People-based powers, but she's genuine, and pretty much everyone on Olympus adores her and would willingly stick their necks out for her.  Hera is technically the Goddess of Family, but I think that's more of a clan/lineage/blood type. Hestia's closer to what the familias in the show represent. I also find it really interesting that the GODDESS of Familias can't get one, and her only current member is the protagonist."

(So your stats have different levels basically) So to go a bit closer into the God-Adventurer relation you basically tell your God how you want your stats and she/he will then distribute the exp accordingly.    One thing to note, in the show your their base stats (int, strength, etc) increase based on what they do.  So if you Dodge a bunch of attacks your dexterity/agility goes up, if you cast some spells your int goes up, etc.   I think this is a more rewarding system then letting the player choose where to dump his/her skill points.  Visiting a goddess for the ""upgrade"" thing would almost be a summary if your adventure, like ""well u almost died a bunch and got punched in the face by a giant, but thanks to that my stamina went through the roof!""   Making the player decide where to put the stats would feel like a mini chore, because then you would have to sit and think about how to build your character.  Maybe have the base stats increase the same way they do in the show, but let the player choose ""perks"" through xp, like increased damage with one handed swords, quicker run speed, health regen, etc."

But kinda like how Bell was frustrated that he couldn't gain any magic (in the first episode)... I've played (tabletop) RPG games where even though we had the freedom to choose our points, we were ""locked out"" of improving attributes we didn't use (or use heavily).    <kinda like the you need experience to get experience riddle>  Maybe make the points system gained where, as an Adventurer, you can ask you Goddess for some ""freedom"" to assign points. Granting up to 10% or 15% max of status points gained, the player, can choose where to put them or save them.  Now there is the catch though, about when the player wishes to spend the ""free stat points"". If the player wishes to put them in an attribute he has ""favored"" since the last ""update"", then the points spend naturally. If the player wishes to spend the points in a not so favored attribute, then the points spend at a 1.5 or 2 point cost per attribute point gained.  Consider the 1.5 or 2 point spending penalty a sort of parallel to book learning/practice vs. performing the motions. Or consider it like someone who is trying to learn something out of their comfort zone. You kinda get it but it takes more to fully get there compared to others.  In the end most of the leveling is based on how you play naturally, but you still have the ability to work at what your are not good at.  Example: Who wants to go dance around all day to boost your agility, if you normally TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK all day long? So if you are a TANK w/ low agility and you find this awesome armor with high defense, but the agility modifier (or requirement) totally throws off your play."
DanMachi,374ojw,BigClifty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:15:41 2015 UTC,there won't be any modifier except for weight.  Thank you for your suggestions but the skill/stats system is already down to what it is since the anime revealed already everything to it.
DanMachi,374ojw,BigClifty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"Probably not exactly what you are looking for but there is a minecraft mod called ""MCMMO that works like this.  Doing different things earn you xp and skill levels for that thing.     So if you mine a lot your mining skill goes up automatically, letting you mine faster and sometimes get double (or triple) drops.  Attacking enemies with an axe lets you do more damage and has a chance to make them bleed, based on what level your axe skill is.  Taking fall damage levels up your Acrobatics skill, allowing you to sometime preform rolls when falling where you take  no damage.  Etc."
DanMachi,374ojw,GUNTMUFFIN,1 point,Mon May 25 06:30:15 2015 UTC,Yea I've thought about that too but I find it somewhat difficult to imagine. I'll have to put down a real concept first before going more indepth^ but yes it is a great thought and I do think it is a great Idea afterall. The only issue I have then is you might end up grinding your stats which I don't like at all so rather distribute them how you like because in some fights you might not be able to choose how to engage and lvl your stats the way you would like to. But I also have thought of a combined art in which you get extra points because you dodged so many times or casted this often a spell and so on.
DanMachi,374ojw,GAMESTER90,2,Mon May 25 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"The only issue I have then is you might end up grinding your stats which I don't like at all   It would be a grind but I think it would be a rewarding grind. In MMO's you are already be grinding for gear, gold, and xp, so why not grind your stats at the same time?  Remember stats go from 0 to 999 and go back to 0 when you level, so going to your goddess after an hour or two in the dungeon and seeing:  ""Strength: +74  Agility: +52  Stamina: +17... ""  (etc)   You are now permanently  stronger than you were before, and you and I think seeing it would give give you such a good feeling.    It's not like manually assigning your stats is bad, I just thing improving your character based on what you do is a cool thing.  The problem of course, is balancing it."
DanMachi,374ojw,gizmosity,1 point,Mon May 25 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"I will really have to think about this more, I've rewatched a couple of episodes and it really makes sense the way you say it."
DanMachi,374ojw,dervalanana,1 point,Mon May 25 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"Clifty has a great point. A game called Runescape, by Jagex, uses a leveling system analogous to danmachi. I have played Runescape for many years and I agree it is very satisfying to get direct rewards in a skill you used however it is always nice to be able to customize the way you progress rather than let the game decide it for you.  If only there was a way to perfectly integrate both ideas into a nicely flowing coherent system.  All i know is i would play the game, that's for sure!"
DanMachi,374ojw,dervalanana,1 point,Tue May 26 01:09:05 2015 UTC,I made changes to it. Hope you like it. I think that's the way to go.
DanMachi,374ojw,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue May 26 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"No I think that they were just attempting to transfer the stat lvling up  mechanic from tradition rpgs into the anime in a reasonable way, although if a mechanic like that existed no doubt players of the game would abuse of it, for example they would go around dodging enemies a lot just so their agility goes up faster, still the mechanic could definitely work if the amount of points per dodge was nerfed, or they used some type of algorithm to keep things in check..."
DanMachi,374ojw,Hammers95,2,Thu Jun 18 07:44:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea and I think you've got something here. Not sure if you stated this because I skimmed over the text but I like the idea of when approaching an enemy, having a quick cut, and then having a 3 dimensional battlefield similar to that of Naruto Shippuden Ninja Storm Series. (Battlefield is small and circular or rectangular and has limited boundaries). Also like the idea of having people either watch or join in on the battle, but I think that to balance this, the person who joins in will only get a portion of the loot and the person who originally initiated the battle will get most of it. Anyways, would love to see a game like this. Good luck :)"

You can keep checking it out. I will also post Game Art and edit everything here to a real concept."
DanMachi,374ojw,Hammers95,2,Mon May 25 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, when I saw the post, I expected something more along the lines of a tRPG kind of game, or at the very least, a party based system. The god would be the party leader, and provide some manner of passive benefits to the party. Depending on how you chose to advance your god (through experience leeched from the dungeon party, as well as potential events around the city and interactions with characters from the series) the benefits of being in your familia would change.   Possibilities for complex systems, such as how rewards are given within the family (i.e. soma's merit/extortion system) would impact things such as the benefits you got from your adventurers (increased gold income. decreased happiness for weaker adventurers, and decreased happiness over time sticking with the soma example). Things such as happiness affecting how many adventures join, or look to leave your family. Reputation in the city based off your policies. Focuses changing to be based on crafting vs adventuring (controlling risk to your family members vs reward)  And then a potential party system beyond that. Essentially, you have a core group of your family's top adventurers and supporters, who you work with individually. You experience the direct combat system with them, and their top achievement affect the family's reputation and unlocks for the family head.   The other members of the family might provide some manner of additional benefit in combat. I.e. if you set extra members to scouting and thinning out monsters on a floor, your main party might face less cannon-fodder,  or find a quicker path through that level (with a potential cost of some members dying or getting injured. possible event of having to protect injured members?) And as these side members progress, they gain the opportunity to join the main party, should the god so choose it. Alternatively, they could focus on arms/armor crafting, or creating consumables, providing safe family income, and potential combat bonuses for the main group.  Just ideas.   I DO like the idea of the combat system that you have, I just feel as though the world lends itself better to a party/guild type system. Even if it's just a party of one (i.e. Hestia/Bell)"

Post Ideas you have, exchange and improve. I do not have the time to edit everything in just a couple of days, sadly. I have work to do and studies. I barely have free time for myself. So thank you. I do want to make this game party based etc. in higher levels later on but not for the first few levels in the dungeon. It will take some time until I post new things but you can pretty much see my finished thought I have when I post an image of it like with the stats system. This is just the very basics now, I honestly have a lot in my mind what you mentioned in your post that I want to integrate into the game. I started today also new things and more detailed stuff to the God profession which exactly suits the stuff you mentioned. So please keep checking it out every now and then, thank you again."

One thing I don't really like is the possibility to be a god: it's not a ""bad"" idea, but from what I can see in the anime, the god are the ones present in our planet story (past and present), and not new ones, so it would be more fair to have all the gods as NPC.  Another idea for the familia is maybe to rank the gods, and make it so that you can choose from a group of minor god when you start, and when you level up, you can ""unlock"" higher tier families, which will bring power ups or buffs to you, but you can also stay in your original familia and increase your familia tier (this will bring a dynamic tier system for the familia, the more players with higher level, the tier will raise, but if you leave a familia, the tier will drop)."

DanMachi,36wb1f,Reikakou,1 point,Sat May 23 00:22:02 2015 UTC,"I have some questions, first it was kinda of expected Bell to have rank S or even SS abilities, but what I didn't get is that did bell level up? At the start they where talking about leveling up, but they didn't say like there is a fixed opponent or place, and at the end of fighting the beast, it dropped part of its horn thingy. So I'm wondering did Bell level up? The beast was a lot stronger than its normal kind , since somebody trained it at the start the beast couldn't catch up, but later did. So the question here is that is the series implying that Bell leveled up? And the stats the person saw was the status of the leveled up Bell( that would make it look cooler , right after leveling up , he might have maxed all his status again ) If so since when you level up it the status (may) auto update once, at least I think that might happen , it would explain about the stats the healer saw."
DanMachi,36wb1f,Reikakou,2,Sat May 23 03:33:15 2015 UTC,"have rank S or even SS abilities   AFAIK nobody has ever gotten SS ranked abilities, stats aren't ""supposed"" to go over S999. Bell is special.   did bell level up   Probably, we'll have to wait until next episode to find out   And the stats the person saw was the status of the leveled up Bell   No, they were pre-level up, the status on people's backs don't change until their god/goddess does their magic voodoo stuff on their back."
DanMachi,36yne0,chaosfire235,2,Sat May 23 05:49:16 2015 UTC,So far. no real conformation in the LN's till VOL6.  There hasn't been much ...evidence to point it towards that direction.  sure there was VERY subtle nods here and there but not a strong one.  i mean until it was pointed out in the /r/anime forums. i never even thought of Syr/Seal being Freya's avatar.  Even though i read the first 5 volumes in depth-ly.  Not sure what happens on vol 7 nor 8.

Also your magic skill is zero until you start ""exercising"" it.  I don't anticipate Bell getting a ton of spells, although you can basically throw out any natural limits when it comes to his status.

DanMachi,36denx,Firadine,1 point,Mon May 18 19:51:06 2015 UTC,He stabbed the Minotaur and shot the Firebolt through his dagger to immolate it.  I think the first time he activated Argonaut was versus the young dragon after he leveled up.

I think ""Magic"" is the type of Magic Ability a person can learn to use. As they increase their Magic Ability Stat and train the type of Magic they use, they can develop new ways to utilize it, again using Aiz's different utilizations of <Ariel> as an example."

DanMachi,36denx,kawaii_jorge,1 point,Sat May 23 08:54:48 2015 UTC,"Probably is derived from the Greek sailors of the original ship Argo, in Greek mythology, who are called ""argonauts"". This in reference to the old Greek heroes, and in particular Jason."

I mean, I don't know if he has a skill called Argonaut, I thought that was a nod to Jason and the Argonauts since Jason killed a Minotaur before setting off on the boat Argo. Heck, they even said he reminded them of Jason."

DanMachi,36af9p,Cheebasaur,1 point,Wed May 20 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"The show seems to be quite popular so it will probably grab a second season. Apprently Akame Ga kill wasnt selling well, so they had to give it an anime original ending rather then leave it open since they knew a second season wasn't coming. Was sad actually because the first half of the AgK anime was soo true to the manga, was probably one of the best adaptations I have seen only to get cut short."
DanMachi,36af9p,SuperWolf,1 point,Wed May 20 15:08:47 2015 UTC,How does the Akame ga kill end in the manga differ from the anime?  Also I didn't realize Dan Machi is further ahead in the anime than the manga (I just binged the manga yesterday).

There is a seemingly infinite dungeon with many and many floors. Inside there are a variety of heinous monsters.  I, together with those adventurers seeking fame and fortune and risking their own lives, registered my own name at the guild, and then began to adventure.  With a sword in my own hand and swiftly emerge abruptly.

DanMachi,362p6t,MegaGMan,1 point,Sat May 16 17:54:45 2015 UTC,yup.
DanMachi,362p6t,Reikakou,8,Fri May 22 21:38:31 2015 UTC,The episode went by so fast... can't get enough of this.  I really like the fact that Lili didn't backed down when Hestia tried to put a fence around Bell. Let the ship to ship battle commence!  I cackled on Bell's reaction when his face met Aiz's ass. The VA did some gold voice acting there.  And Karmic deaths to all those who have bullied Lili!  I also like how the show displayed the difference between Bell and Aiz's strength and experience despite Bell's supposedly tremendous growth. Stats are meaningless if you do not have the brains to be able to use it well.  No overarching plot in sight. Only Freya obsessing over Bell.
DanMachi,362p6t,soah1086,4,Sat May 16 04:47:35 2015 UTC,Great episode! Was really loving all the interactions Bell had with Aiz. Now we seem to have a boosted minotaur to antagonize Bell or maybe some other character. I feel like Bell will have to deal with it though.
DanMachi,362p6t,MegaGMan,1 point,Fri May 15 17:59:55 2015 UTC,i think that minotaur was used as a karmic implement on the Soma group.
DanMachi,362p6t,Reikakou,3,Fri May 15 21:05:19 2015 UTC,That and I think Freya's adventurer trained that particular minotaur to face Bell later on to help him grow and get over his fear of it. Damn Freya's one manipulative goddess.

The rest would be spoilers if you haven't seen all 8 eps of the anime. it seems the gods are still immortal or at very least long lived because Hephaestus speaks of hundreds of years prior of Hestia borrowing money, and hundreds of years to pay it back. Also, they seem to still have magical powers. Sort of how Freyja(original spelling. source) made those men get exicted and fall out, how Hestia heals bell (or gods can use magic like humans) and how Hephaestus smithed Bell's weapon."

I also liked how they kinda combined the credits and the last few scenes at the very end to give me a reason to watch all the way through. I'm really pumped for next weeks episode! I'm also wondering if Lili will end up joining Bell's familia (please note I haven't read the LN's/manga so I'm in the dark here and I would like to be kept that way).

DanMachi,35avs6,SirkovTheWanderer,1 point,Fri May 8 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, I think she said she was saving up to leave, so maybe Soma has a fee to leave the familia? Maybe Bell will pay it eventually."

It's really easy for people to hate Lili, but I do think she is a well written tragic character. I still really like Bell his speech was really good, I think people get too hung up on calling him a dumb, naive white knight. I think he's a good kid who does dumb stuff because he's new at this and being overly nice is probably why so many people like Syr, Hestia, Aiz, Eina, and Lili want to help him."
DanMachi,35avs6,Jaynight,3,Fri May 8 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"Another excellent episode. I have to say I am quite happy that my worries over pacing mostly seem to be defeated. While yes every week the episode seems shorter (because I love the series) it seems less and less material is rushed into each episode giving them more substance. I am only up to date with the manga and official LN releases so it seems the anime will out pace them very soon, but that is fine I will still love reading the LN for the extra details.   That said cannot wait to see Bell's future. Its kinda exciting not knowing what will come next. Well not next episode but come 8 It will probably be all new material for me unless another chapter of manga releases.  Does anyone know how many episodes are in this season? Seems like we are only going to get 12 episodes."

DanMachi,35avs6,Reikakou,2,Sat May 9 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"So Lili officially joins Bell's harem.  Very nice episode overall. Almost tear up on Lili's monologue.  Though I think Bell's reason of saving Lili is somewhat... dumb... I don't know if I can do what Bell did. He almost died out there and Lili basically blurted out 101 reasons for him to hate her.  But if I have to look on a different angle on Bell's explanation, maybe he simply really like Lili so much as his supporter, almost similar to his infatuation to Aiz, that he's willing to throw away common sense and forgive her.  Although I think it's still a win-win for Bell and Lili in the end after he finally gained Lili's absolute trust and gratitude.  Great episode. Now, lemme kick those Soma hooligans' ass as I don't see Bell seeking revenge for Lili's sake.  The question is, after those Soma guys left Lili for dead, does it mean that she's a freelancer now that can be accepted by the Hestia's familia or any other familia for that matter?"
DanMachi,35avs6,Hammers95,2,Sat May 9 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we have to remember that the reason Bell is in Orario is because of his dream to save a girl in the dungeon to make her fall in love with him.

DanMachi,34rys4,num421337,13,Mon May 4 01:26:55 2015 UTC,Some people just don't understand the words of Goddess Hestia. These people are misguided and we should help them get back on track. I don't see the gentleman in the video as an enemy of Goddess Hestia. We will bring those who are lost to /r/HestiaTheWaifuGoddess where we will make them accept Goddess Heatia as their Lord and Saviour.
DanMachi,34rys4,KenadianH,9,Mon May 4 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"she is like any other character, with her own personality and traits. some ppl like her the way she is, and some don't. I like her for what its worth.  she did get a huge surge of popularity when the anime was released for whatever reason, and was everywhere on the net. once again, some ppl like that, and some dont.  she may be seen as overrated, annoying, etc. but theres no rational reason to deserve this kind of hatred."
DanMachi,34rys4,Flicker07,1 point,Mon May 4 02:51:47 2015 UTC,"I like her, I can see why for a short while a lot of the internet liked her. The hate.... Not so much"
DanMachi,34rys4,Flicker07,1 point,Mon May 4 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"if their is an intense hatred, its because of the haters, not Hestia. she hasnt done anything that deserves this much hatred. I could hate her immensely right now if i wanted too for no reason. as long as she is still a trending topic, people will show their disdain for her. Out of sight, out of mind, i always say."
DanMachi,34rys4,Yuri-tan,9,Mon May 4 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"It's the general concept of popularity. When a huge amount of people love one specific thing, there will also be a big group of people who will dislike it, either because they don't like the specific thing, or they don't like the thing by proxy of annoyance from the fan base.  In this case, it's probably both. People dislike her character, and end up hating it because those who love her shove it down on anyone they can.  One can sum it up as that many hate her simply because so many love her."
DanMachi,34rys4,montugar,1 point,Mon May 4 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"Basically, haters gunna hate"
DanMachi,34rys4,AlienWarhead,4,Tue May 12 20:54:26 2015 UTC,She's a loli who is sexualized and it doesn't matter that she is probably hundreds of years old she'll still get hate for it.
DanMachi,34rys4,Jaynight,3,Mon May 4 22:04:57 2015 UTC,I like Hestia although shes not my favorite girl from Danmachi. Her attutide while adorable can be fustrating at times. If she really loves Bell that much she should be a little more forward with him. He is dense after all. However I guess its not proper for a little goddess to come out and confess her love for a human.
DanMachi,34rys4,Asks_Politely,1 point,Mon May 4 12:01:26 2015 UTC,That might not work considering he's already been confessed to and it really didn't even phase him
DanMachi,34rys4,thechaospredator,3,Mon May 4 12:31:19 2015 UTC,"Because she's super popular, and it's the ""cool"" thing in the anime community to hate what's popular."
DanMachi,34rys4,Porohunter,3,Mon May 4 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't hate hestia but I don't necessarily think she's the best girl. The reason people hate her is because it's annoying to see her being spammed or spamming ""hestia is bestia."" I know some people just hate her because of her character, but most people hate her because if you go on anywhere anime related, you can't go five minutes without someone bringing her up."
DanMachi,34rys4,Porohunter,2,Sat May 23 15:18:53 2015 UTC,Because everyone has different opinions.
DanMachi,34rys4,abucketofpuppies,3,Mon May 4 03:50:18 2015 UTC,but such a deep hatred as some people express? i just don't understand it
DanMachi,34rys4,halfgenieheroism,0,Mon May 4 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Things like tone are hard to gauge on the net. Someone that has a dislike of something, and someone with an intense burning hatred can use the same terminology. So what you view as incredibly vitriolic, may just be them saying that they don't think Hestia has the bestia chestia."
DanMachi,34rys4,PurpletonPimps,2,Mon May 4 04:07:04 2015 UTC,I think they just dislike her because she's so possessive.

DanMachi,34rys4,Rei-kun,1 point,Tue May 5 10:47:11 2015 UTC,To be honest I didn't think people hated her.  Maybe mock/parody her image but it's all in good spirit.

DanMachi,34ms16,LafferStyle,1 point,Sun May 3 09:00:01 2015 UTC,"It's essentially a ""side-story"" like ""Sword Oratoria"" of volume 1. It has an OC (now stay with me here!) and while he interacts with the original novel's characters, he does nothing major to change the original plot. That said, he behaves very two-dimensionally for the majority of the story.  However, he does have his own storyline, albeit he doesn't do much. He's an adventure, but refuses to join any of the gods' Familia. He's trying to get by the events of volume 1 while investigating Orario's darker aspects, the abusive supporter-adventurer relationship just being one of them.  It's mostly just world-building with some head-canon to fill in empty gaps (parts of the world that the novel doesn't explain)  P.S., Also, if anyone who's up-to-date with the novels, can you tell me if there are any details I probably should know, even if they're spoilery? I want it as canon as possible."

DanMachi,34iqp6,ErroneousLogic,5,Sun May 10 18:47:03 2015 UTC,after reading ch 34 of the manga. Lili is the cutest girl ever. Spoilers
DanMachi,34iqp6,Venom_is_an_ace,3,Sun May 3 19:19:30 2015 UTC,So far I'm partial to Syr and Eina. Hestia is cute and all but realistically her getting with Bell will only end in heart break. She is an immortal goddess and he is a mortal human. I like Aiz but she has other priorities it seems.
DanMachi,34iqp6,Jaynight,3,Fri May 1 15:54:35 2015 UTC,I could see it having it end with her completely giving up her immortality or something along those lines. It'll probably end up getting determined by the fan base.
DanMachi,34iqp6,Ralmaelvonkzar,2,Fri May 1 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"That is possible, however it seems like Aiz is to be main girl."
DanMachi,34iqp6,Jaynight,5,Fri May 1 22:32:51 2015 UTC,IMO Hestia is still the bestia.
DanMachi,34iqp6,Ralmaelvonkzar,2,Sat May 2 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"All signs so far point towards a harem.  In the anime his grampa said ""go get yourself a woman""  In the LN he told him ""attaining a harem is the most noble cause"""
DanMachi,34iqp6,montugar,2,Wed May 13 11:00:21 2015 UTC,"Hestia climbed to 2nd on my list of best looking female-characters after last nights episode. When she got dressed up for Bell she looked amazing.  Still, I highly doubt we will see any relationship between them before the end of the anime or far later in the seasons.  I read something very smart the other day. There is a reason harem is so popular in Anime, there is a reason a lot of anime seem to never finish their love-stories until the very very end or not at all. It's because we all love the tension, the mystery and the pre-relationship romance and flirting. But when they are a couple, all of that goes away, and the relationship has to be very well developed in order for the viewers to enjoy it."
DanMachi,34iqp6,Azeriel,2,Sun May 3 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"There is a reason harem is so popular in Anime   Your reason makes sense with Danmachi and many other harem anime, but I find it to be true here because there are other points to the plot. The lack of a MC making a clear choice isn't so bad especially when there is other things going on like the Dungeon and the familias. However say if something like Nisekoi ended openly I would be very upset. I am enjoying the ride so far, it is what makes watching it fun, but regardless if Raku chooses the girl I like or not doesn't matter, he just needs to make a choice :P"
DanMachi,34iqp6,Jaynight,2,Sun May 3 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. Myself I love the romance, and I really enjoy anime that has a lot of romance in it.  I am cheering for Hestia and Bell. But time will show how it all develops. I haven't read the LNs so sadly I cannot foresee anything here until it more episodes comes out. I think that last episode was the first time I saw Bell looking kinda in-love with Hestia. But I think that he is thinking that since she is kamisama he can't do anything to her.   Nonetheless, a lot of stuff can happen here and I'm excited. I am really really enjoying this anime."
DanMachi,34iqp6,Azeriel,2,Sun May 3 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"I dont know, id say Aiz because she's kinda intrusting with her power and her thoughts, but Eina, in the last episode, make me totally crazy about her. So id say Ryu-san. :D"

So the attributes are really like sub-attributes of a particular level, or that your level is a scale factor for your attributes?  As in say you have Agl of 1000 @ level 1 When you level up to 2 does your Agl reset down to 1 or does your 1000 stat get some kind of multiplier?

Which truthfully I find hilarious considering the circlejerk hate of SAO over there. Just remember everyone as things get popular the haters will undoubtedly jump out from the woodwork.  Please don't listen to them. If you love this series that is your choice and opinion don't let someone sway you into hating it just because they can't get any enjoyment from anything.  That said Lili is even cuter then I remembered in the manga. Not sure why they decided to give her more cat like ears but you wont have any complaints from me.

DanMachi,33q4yg,Mariner11663,2,Fri Apr 24 22:10:05 2015 UTC,Awesome! Do you know if they are sold on kindle? I really don't have a lot of space in my bedroom to put all of the novels anywhere
DanMachi,33q4yg,Jaynight,3,Fri Apr 24 22:15:36 2015 UTC,Both are available on kindle.

DanMachi,33q4yg,LafferStyle,2,Fri Apr 24 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"At the beginning I was really skeptical like ""Why does she keep on smiling suspiciously?"" and then that his blade got stolen. I found it really cool that not only does the blade grow with him, but it is virtually ineffective when he's not using it. It's like the fingerprint gun from Skyfall.  On the discussion thread in /r/anime, here I saw a comment that was stating how sexist it was that Bell said that he was protecting Lili just because she was a girl. Responses?"
DanMachi,33q4yg,wtrmlnjuc,2,Sat Apr 25 04:51:54 2015 UTC,"A few things/ideas about Bell's response:   His goal for being an Adventurer at first was to, as the title implies, ""pick up girls in a dungeon"". (Well, it happened to be the other way around for him.) He still has that fantasy of protecting others straight out of fairy tales/storybooks. He kinda just says it offhandedly like he's confused, since he doesn't know her. Lili's a hobbit, so her build is exceptionally small. Saying ""she's a girl"" could literally have meant, ""she's a small child/person stop terrorizing her""."
DanMachi,33q4yg,LafferStyle,2,Sat Apr 25 06:32:20 2015 UTC,"as the title implies, ""pick up girls in a dungeon"". (Well, it happened to be the other way around for him.)   wait is the title ""Is it Wrong to try to pick up Girls in a Dungeon"" or ""Is it Wrong that I want to meet you in a Dungeon""?"
DanMachi,33q4yg,TonyRimor,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:05:41 2015 UTC,"""is it wrong to pick up girls in the dungeon?"" I have the light novel on my desk. It must look weird for people who don't know what it's about."
DanMachi,33q4yg,AlienWarhead,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:09:54 2015 UTC,"A boy should still protect girls despite how played out it is and how butthurt internet people get over it. Honestly it's good manners to help a girl in need and I get that the damsel in distress is demeaning to women, but it's still the right thing to help someone in need. The ""she a girl"" response for Bell means ""I'm doing this because it the hero thing to do"" and not ""I'm taking the girl's side here because I'm sexist"" or ""I'm helping her so I'll get laid later"". If Bell actually was sexist he would have been mad that Aizu saved him, instead of having a crush on her and wanting to be strong so she'll notice him and so he can stand next to her."

Good luck on your future wallpapers."
DanMachi,33eliy,Spada05,2,Tue Apr 21 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"They clarify the requirement pretty clearly at Volume 3, but you probably see that in the anime before the novel comes out."
DanMachi,33eliy,Shinokawa,2,Wed Apr 22 00:47:36 2015 UTC,Volume 3? By that do you mean LN Book #3?
DanMachi,33eliy,Painn23,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:54:55 2015 UTC,Yes
DanMachi,33eliy,Articlaus,2,Wed Apr 22 01:02:47 2015 UTC,Well to offer a somewhat small intro into the stats.  Basically to level up. you need to experience something that affects you on a personal level. Something that has meaning to you and your Goddess. Which means everyone doesn't need to kill a powerful enemy to level up. Sure EXP is important but the level up act is not neccesseraly a monster kill. IE a blacksmith can level up by creating a powerful weapon etc.  As for stats. once you level up all of your stats resets to 0.  But this doesn't mean you go weak/slow. It means you can now go even more faster and powerful. IE if you had 900points in the STR before going to level 2. and after a while if your STR is 200 in Level 2. this means you don't have 200 STR but rather 900+200=1100 Overall STR. Hence there's a clear difference between a person with 900 STR and level 1 to a 400STR Level 2 Adventurer.  The more point you have in your stats before leveling up. that much more powerful you will be after. IE bell will be really OP in the future. Since he's the only Person to bypass the S Rank to SS and even SSS when leveling up. hence his overall stats is always more than the adventurers in equal to his level.
DanMachi,33eliy,AlienWarhead,1 point,Thu May 7 14:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm also in the middle of Book 2 and I don't remember anyone saying at what point a person levels up just that it's a big step and there's a big difference between level 1 and 2.
DanMachi,33eliy,Firadine,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"I hope they clarify it, probably once Bell does decide to level up (it's inevitable, right?). With so many specifics, it's driving me a little nuts that what is seemingly the most important detail is all a mystery."
DanMachi,33eliy,Firadine,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"You level up by killing a monster above your skill level (this can be done as a group) or completing an achievement of personal significance. Your old stats are retained but hidden and you start over at I rank 0 for each.   Edit: Silverback is a level 1 monster from floor 12, I believe."
DanMachi,33eliy,338388,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"I got a bit further and am now on book 3, but this is still helpful. I figured the leveling might be that way after Aizu hit 6. The stat points were a mystery but I sort of guessed similar to what you're saying. Thanks!"
DanMachi,33eliy,338388,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"You still keep the str/sta/agi/mag proficiency you earn on the previous level, but there is basically a visual reset on the number so people capped out can keep growing after leveling up. Aizu's individual stats could be anywhere from 1 - ~6000 depending on how close to the cap she was before /after each level up."

DanMachi,335m6u,asianyeti,11,Sun Apr 19 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"99% sure Freya = Syr   In her first scene with Bell she gives him a magic crystal he obviously didn't drop. Later that night she tells him she likes to ""collect interesting people"". During the monster fair Bell looks for Syr, but can't find her. Freya spots him searching along the path she would have travelled and leaves without paying(no wallet) and tails in the shadows. She probably intends to join him as Syr until she's found by Hestia. After Bell defeats the ape Syr tells Bell she witnessed him beat the monster which was in the deepest part of the ghetto. After Ryu returns Bell's dagger Ryu confirm Lili isn't the hobbit who stole it, but Syr had seen through the illusion and threatens Lili. The magic book appears in inn without anyone recalling who brought it. Syr tells Bell he should start reading then forces the book on him."
DanMachi,335m6u,Firadine,10,Mon Apr 20 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"Really like the detail about Freyja not paying for the drinks with Loki.  More possible evidence:   Right before Bell meets Syr for the first time, he has that premonition of danger/being watched. Syr, mythologically, is a name Freyja uses when in disguise. Syr's last name is a term for ""lady"" derived from Freyja. Their hair color is similar, not a huge point, but just an interesting one. Syr explicitly says that none of this would have happened if she hadn't lost her wallet, which goes along perfectly with Freyja's plan. After Hestia collapses, Freyja says she might have been too mean to Hestia. The very next time we see Syr, she asks if Hestia is OK. The bar Syr works at has a sign on it (in the English subbed anime, not sure if it's like this in other versions) that says ""Hostess of Fertility"". Freyja is a goddess of Fertility."
DanMachi,335m6u,Silent_Talker,2,Tue Apr 21 06:24:26 2015 UTC,+1 I support this theory. Sounds plausible. But what's the point to all this? Is she just teasing Hestia and get Bell as another trophy?
DanMachi,335m6u,aljaro,1 point,Sat May 9 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's teasing since no one knows. I think it lets her interact with and observe Bell. But it seems like the author isn't revealing it any time soon, so maybe there will be a deeper reason. Maybe it's supposed to be a big twist later"
DanMachi,335m6u,Silent_Talker,2,Sat May 9 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I REALLY want to believe it, but at the same time I'm thrown off by Syr's behavior around his coworkers. Like how she blushes when teased by them and how she can make normal conversations with them.  Which makes me think, if Ryu was Freya's accomplice (as Syr) they're not really going to have conversations like that. Ryu seems like a perceptive individual who can tell when someone's hiding something (probably through Freya's disguise), so that's another thing that's stopping me from believing the Freya accusations."
DanMachi,335m6u,27618349,2,Mon Apr 20 21:24:03 2015 UTC,"I think you might be onto something - mythologically, Syr is one of Freyja's names."
DanMachi,335m6u,Silent_Talker,2,Mon Apr 20 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"Her last name is also derived from Freya.  And to be more specific, Syr is one of the names Freyja uses when she is in disguise so, in my opinion, that's even more damning than just being an name for Freyja"
DanMachi,334m8i,fortune82,3,Sun Apr 19 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the light novels mainly because the manga adaptions were based off the light novels, but if you prefer manga and actually seeing whats going on then get the manga. Also you can find the first volume of the light novels here. I don't know where the manga adaption is so sorry I couldn't help with that !  [Edit] I found out just now that the manga adaptation will be released in May of 2015 for English by Yen Press if that helps you at all. Also imo if you have the money I say you get the light novel now and then get the manga later if you enjoy this series so far."

So, the anime-only watchers finally got their reasoning for why she didn't just give him the knife outright, we got some sweet boobstring material and some really good action. Also, Dat ass"
DanMachi,32xwvz,AlienWarhead,6,Fri Apr 17 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"That fight scene was really good and inspiring with that believe in yourself and believe in the me that believes in you speech from Hestia. She was cute with Bell this episode and she even told Bell that she loves him, but Bell not going to understand that because he thinks he shouldn't or can't date a goddess. I hope the show addresses this at some point whether or not mortals and gods date, is it taboo, can they have kids, would those kids gods, demigods, or mortal, etc. Bell even got a second girl to confess her love to him, but I doubt Bell will date anyone until the very end. All in all this is a great episode and I'm almost done with the first LN, I wonder if I should keep going."
DanMachi,32xwvz,prayedit,3,Fri Apr 17 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"can they have kids, would those kids gods, demigods   demigods :p  are the light novels worth it? I've never read one before, but not opposed.."
DanMachi,32xwvz,AlienWarhead,2,Sat Apr 18 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"I like volume 1 so far and I'm almost finished it, I like how they explain more about the world. I'm not sure if I like Bell more with or without all the internal monologue from the novel, it's great to know what he's thinking, but I liked how he seemed more innocent in the anime. The first LN is a good read, but I haven't read the others yet."
DanMachi,32xwvz,wtrmlnjuc,2,Sat Apr 18 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"Yeup. Book one should be available legally online, I think.   The others (2-4) are floating around as pdfs somewhere, but 3&4 haven't been edited much, so they will be harder to read through."
DanMachi,32xwvz,matty-a,3,Thu Apr 23 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"Really loved this ep, glad that they seem to be taking a slower pace instead of throwing a million different things at us again!"
DanMachi,32xwvz,Jaynight,3,Fri Apr 17 18:36:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. Nice that they slowed down and actually gave us a full and awesome fight scene.
DanMachi,32xwvz,matty-a,4,Fri Apr 17 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeh that fight was awesome, I loved the way he used a clothes line to sling shot himself at the monster."
DanMachi,32xwvz,Jaynight,3,Fri Apr 17 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"First LN covered in 3 episodes. Not bad but a little quick for my taste. Guess the season will be 12 episodes and cover 4 LN's then? Unless they slow down some more which they may. Sucks that I have only read the first LN, waiting on amazon to deliver the second but I should be good for the next arc as I have read the manga adaptation.  Also Hestia looks good in any outfit"

DanMachi,32xwvz,wtrmlnjuc,4,Fri Apr 17 22:25:13 2015 UTC,She would've needed space and time to upgrade his status before the knife would be activated and useful. Running away from a monster kinda hinders that a little.
DanMachi,32ssqa,Groanius,5,Thu Apr 16 12:50:14 2015 UTC,LOL dont worry because it took longer for her to give him the knife in the manga it took 2 episodes for the anime the manga took freaking like i think was 5 to 6 chapters XD
DanMachi,32ssqa,Addonays,5,Sat Apr 18 16:46:19 2015 UTC,"This has always pissed me off.  She had a HUGE window to give it to him but delayed it for NO REASON.  How hard could it be to say ""Bell, here's a knife"""

DanMachi,32ssqa,TheWizardofOrz,3,Thu Apr 16 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess it's because it has to be ""soulbound"" to him using a similar process to the one where she can read his stats. Next episode'll be out tomorrow I guess so hopefully I'm right."
