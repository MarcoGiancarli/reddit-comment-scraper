People being surprised that HoN is a fair bit above Smite clearly underestimate HoN's following in SEA.

First off, congratulations opening your ""argument"" by calling all league players children and then acting like a 14 year old virgin neckbeard. Hilarious. Second, League became bigger than Dota and one of the biggest games in the world before there even was a world championship or anything.

Klanx will receive a slight nerf."
HeroesofNewerth,3dycdh,WerdsWerth,3,Mon Jul 20 16:30:22 2015 UTC,It's seems like FB is listening to the community. I remember that after that balance patch announced (The last balance patch of hon). Some are disappointed about the 0 added in SOTM in hon (someone posted about it in hon forum general discussion) why dota2 balanced patch are about Aghanims update(SOTM in hon).
HeroesofNewerth,3dycdh,Deathzthe,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"they absolutely do, the competitive players are really who balance this game - wza conspires with them in pretty well most of his balance related dealings.  and yeh, he mentioned dota2 when discussing the idea to add sotm effects for so many heroes, so you may be right. he made a good point regarding its ubiquity in dota2 though; sotm is one of the most picked up items in the game, behind essentials like teleports. the item is just significantly less cool when everyone has it, so they implement it in such a way that it is viable on some heroes, and others not. Else, they do not implement it.  Great way to balance it imo."
HeroesofNewerth,3dycdh,WerdsWerth,7,Mon Jul 20 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Making all the staff effects be best in slot type things that everyone wants to get shouldn't be a goal, Wza is right about that. But they should all be fun and at least situationally useful.    I look at Chronos staff effect as a perfect example of what to do. It has plenty of uses and sometimes it is a great pickup, but it's rarely default pickup for that hero, especially if you are playing as the first position carry. It's also a lot of fun with letting your teammates continue to move in the ult - it really changes how you can position it.  On the other hand, staff effects like Pyromancer or Thunderbringer or Pollywog Priest where all they do is +some damage are boring and should be redesigned, imo."

HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,pribnow,8,Sun Jul 19 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"If something attack an allied hero, it will target it. If no heroes are attacked, the tower attack back whoever attack it. If no one attack the tower, it will attack something in range.   For each step, the tower attack first checks its priority list (from Mechanic FAQ ) :   Tower Aggro priority : (-1) to ""siege"" units, (-2) to ""tower"" units, (-3) to ""structure"" unit, (+0) to all others. Tower Attack priority : (+2) to ""tower"" units, (-3) to ""structure"" unit, (+0) to all others. Tower Proximity priority : (+0) to all. Tower Target priority : (-1) to ""siege"" units, (-2) to ""tower"" units, (-3) to ""structure"" unit, (+1) to all others.   It so among the same level (i.e. to choose between 2 units that attack a hero, which one to choose), it will first check who has priority. For example, if a siege weapon and a creep both attack a hero, it will first attack the creep.  If both units has the same priority, then it will be the closest to the tower.  Once the tower has chosen its target, it will attack it until it leaves its range OR someone triggers a higher level of ""defense mode"" (a.k.a. if the tower is attacking a unit that is destroying the tower, but you start attacking a hero, attacking a hero is a higher level than defending itself, so the tower will switch target)."

Will occasionally switch from attacking creep to attacking a hero (when both are attacking it). It seems to always happened with scout coming out of invis with his attack speed boast, but will randomly happen with other heroes and with no discernible provocation."
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,thefartmongerer,2,Mon Jul 20 01:43:20 2015 UTC,"I've noticed it happens on scout mainly because when he attacks, he seems to get in closer to the tower than the creeps. I'm not saying this is how it SHOULD be but it's how I see it"
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,LinguoNuts,2,Mon Jul 20 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"I guess it's probably not the ""attack from invis"" but the disarm effect. It probably ""reset"" the tower target since it has been disable and since Scout is the closest target, he gains the aggro."
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,Tartalacame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"i have also noticed this, but it always seems random."
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,filenotfounderror,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:08 2015 UTC,"You need to stop attacking the tower when it finishes killing 1 of your creeps,otherwise it will change priority to your hero."
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,CJXander,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:25:48 2015 UTC,Attacks first target to enter aggro area unless you attack another hero in the aggro area then it will switch to you.  If multiple hero's all attack other hero's I assume it's random who gets targeted.
HeroesofNewerth,3dvwm2,jjb985,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:53 2015 UTC,You can use direct pathing to attack a tower from behind creeps which is very handy for melees.
HeroesofNewerth,3duiz4,xAmplify,4,Sun Jul 19 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"Haven't played HoN in a year now, but I was 1900+ when I left. Killer game sense is what separates a good players from the bad ones.  At lower brackets, I generally instant pick a mid hero or a carry and if someone steals middle because they're an asshole, I just go to another lane or go jungle(Level 1 Jungle Soul Stealer? I'll do my best to make that work). As long as you don't start fights and have good farm, you're pretty much good to go. And you can pick literally any hero and it'll work as long as you have good game sense.   I suggest that people practice their prediction skills and their game sense rather then their team playing. I started out at around 1400 and climbed to 1900 within less than two years just by practicing those two things.   Note: This is only a short term answer. Once you reach a higher skill bracket, you'll realize that team work will slowly become essential and pub stomping will be harder. At my bracket, I mostly do hard supporting since I am very confident in my supporting and (In my opinion) it's much more fun since I get to roam around more, leading to more action. Carrying in higher brackets has those games where you farm for 20 minutes and only get to team fight for only a few times of the game, which is pretty boring.  tl;dr: Hone your game sense rather than your team working skills if you want to leave the lower bracket."
HeroesofNewerth,3duiz4,Fujikawa28,3,Sun Jul 19 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"Lane control is very important. Don't expect ganks to go so easy when you're always pushing the other team to their tower.    Some low bracket games, you get no support. I just had this game as legionnaire. Magmus mid fucked up and kinesis is roam-killing us the whole map. I started warding/dewarding and we eventually turned the game.    Whatever your role, if you need wards just go and buy them. Even if you're a carry!"

HeroesofNewerth,3duiz4,Tartalacame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm I do almost all of those things currently except for farm super well, yet still find myself stuck in the 1300 bracket.    When playing a carry I typically am around 300-400gpm in games that are going well/even but quite a bit lower than that if the game is going poorly.  I know that isn't great farm because I see carries on honcast doing 500-600+ regularly, but it really can be difficult when your team is a bunch of pubs and all 5 of them are trying to get farm for themselves and bitching (loudly) if you ever miss a team fight."
HeroesofNewerth,3duiz4,Hinko,2,Sun Jul 19 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"It can be hard getting 500++ gpm in some games, most likely to happen in brackets lower than 18-1900.  Now, you can have good farm rotations and awareness but hardly break the 500 mark because of your team mates. It's a valid point that your hard support pyromancer shouldn't go to the approaching wave at the t2 tower and nuke out 4 waves when you're just behind him. Neither should your jungler or your suicide.  How to counter this? Pick a carry that can do that, but faster and with rather low farm. Klanx, tremble, silhouette, tdl come to mind.   Though, if you're stuck in the 1300 bracket, I think you're better off picking more active carries anyway."
HeroesofNewerth,3duiz4,PimpinIsAHustle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"Just pick a mid game carry. Predator or Zephyr or something. They function incredibly well if you can keep up about 300gpm. It's obviously better to go 450gpm TDL, but until then, just go an easy carry.  Pred literally needs boots, insanitarius and elder parasite and you can wreck everything up until 1650"

As long as it stays that way, we'll be fine even if the player base is shrinking.  But the competitive seen is essentially non existent / dead when compared to the other MoBA's. There are great players, but they arent as good as the hay day for this game. Its pretty stale.  But who knows, that could change- i like what FB are doing much better than S2."

HeroesofNewerth,3dp1u0,inthe6,0,Sat Jul 18 06:43:58 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on how you look at ""growing"" and ""dying.""    In my own opinion, every game is growing and dying at the same time. Every game loses players, every game wins players. If you look at the development team, it's way better than before. The competitive scene is continuously growing, judging by the return of CoL.HoN, and a reasonable amount of competitive leagues. Garena has acquired HoN and there was a screenshot that circulated around recently showing prizepool of HoN Tour Season 4."

If I get put in a 2k rated game and I'm the only 1800, the chances that I will be able to carry vs their level of play is low. I can likely support or suicide at that level though, so if I'm in a game where I'm significantly lower rated than my team I'm going to be far more accommodating with my hero choice.   Good support can turn games, but the reality is the support can't fix a carry that can last hit or doesn't know how to play a carry properly."

HeroesofNewerth,3dl2pr,vindidead2,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"Sages Lore: Looks good, but I think the mana cost being a flat 140 is too high. That is way too expensive for level 1 of that ability. It should scale something like 95/110/125/140 cost.  Master's Incantation: A nice buff to this skill, and I love the permanent int boost coming back. Very happy about this.  Glyph of Silence: Still not happy about this being an activated gadget rather than a passive ability. I really prefer heroes to have at least one passive ability in their skillset. Still, this is a lot better than the previous version, and I quite like how it has a decent cast range now. The live version of this is a pain in the ass to use because of it's absurdly short cast range. Also, the effects being frontloaded rather than  dependent on the opponent using a spell inside it's aura is nice.  I guess the downside I see to this ability is that it's just a mini-ultimate now on a 17 second cooldown rather than something different for the hero to do.   Final Chapter: Some nice buffs too the ultimate as well with additional effects being tagged onto it. +1"

HeroesofNewerth,3dl2pr,TheSwedeIrishman,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"Overall it seems like a buff, because even though it's slightly less bursty (HP removal is like temporary true damage, now it's just adding physical damage), but the strength steal is pretty huge.

HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,ElementUser,9,Thu Jul 16 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'm just brainstorming here, but I like the idea of Draco being a scary strong dragon. The player can choose between building str or agi, and both will benefit his skillset.   Q- Dragon' Maw - A short range single target attack (bite) that does physical damage and causes bleeding for a time. The higher Draco's agility, the lower the cooldown. The higher his strength, the longer the bleed effect.  W- Dragon's Flight - Fly up in the air for a short amount of time granting %movespeed, and after a time, or on activation, slam down dealing aoe physical damage. Higher agi gives a longer flight time, higher Str increases the aoe.  E - Dragon's Flame - Activate to cause auto attacks to burn through an opponent's armor, also dealing magic damage in an aoe around the target. (not sure how the agi/str would work here yet)  R- Dragon's Fury - Activate to send draconis into a rage, causing his main stats to be agi and str. (Adding his str to his damage) also adds X attack speed for the duration and an aoe magic damage around himself on activation."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,paypaypayme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:00 2015 UTC,"W and E look ehh. R looks like it's overpowered, but the concept of adding a second trait to passive damage sounds REALLY cool. I like that idea. Plus an attack speed boost. This fits in really well with Frostburn's idea of making him an exclusively single target carry.  Q looks best of all. That mechanic sounds perfect for a dragon. Make it a burn effect instead of a bleed to fit the canon and this sounds like a GREAT skill."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,marlfoxy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"My idea behind this was that his abilities would only be really strong if he got plenty of stat items. That way the hero would scale with farm, rather than xp. This would keep him from being OP but still allow him to be a hard carry. Not to mention all of the abilities are activatable, so he will need a decent mana pool as well. I definitely think the w and e could use a little tweaking, I wanted to keep the feel of old draco while adding a physical aspect. I assumed a bleed effect would be physical, what is morax's bleed damage?"

So naturally I thought what about some kind of ability that allows draconis to attach himself onto a building / tower that then allows him to do extra burst damage of some sort / fear enemies around it or something.

Thanks for all the posts :)  wza also posted his thoughts in the Balance Discussion mirror thread here, which shows a lot of his personal thought processes when thinking of a rework with Draconis. I will post the quoted post here:   So I will try to give you guys a look as to how I have been moving along with Draconis and tell you some of the pitfalls I have been running into. (this is just to help facilitate feedback and get your ideas flowing. Maybe you can take an idea of mine and turn it into something workable) Later I can post the current rework and gain thoughts!  1st. I am a huge nerd, I go to magic pre-release tournaments and I am a DM for dungeons and dragons once a week, so lets just say I understand where a lot of you are coming from when you talk about dragons.  Now every designer is different but I tend to design around a theme or character rather than a mechanic. So for instance I designed Solstice around the idea of this proudful half man half lion that roamed the jungle during the day strong like the king of the jungle and at night transforming into a panther to stalk down her prey. It was much later that content decided to make it Solstice and be a woman in massive armor but thats neither here nor there. The point im getting at is designing a hero around a Dragon, is kind of my cup of tea.  I have thought about making draconis a dracolich (an undead dragon) that spawns bone baby dragons.  I have thought about doing an ultimate that splits you into 3 dragons one of water one of fire and one of poison, or one red one white and one black. I have thought about being an old man and then ulting and turning into a massive dragon. I have thought about Tiamat (Queen of evil Dragons in Dungeons and Dragons) that has 5 heads one being of each color black green red blue white and having all your abilities be different based on the head you use. I have thought about lairs, like spawning a mountain out of the ground that gives you a percentage of all gold in the area and then after a duration the mountain explodes into lava revealing it to be a volcano I have thought about breathing in fire and then unleashing a massive blast I have thought about global fireballs and wing buffets! I have thought about spawning a fairytale castle with a princess inside and Draconis climbs on top of it becoming a massive turret like thing. I have thought about draconis flying off the map and your UI turns into the mouth of a dragon and you gain a reticle and lob fire balls down from heaven I have thought about doing strafe runs with fire and global flying ultimates I have thought about starting out as a baby dragon and evolving into different dragons I have thought about doing a full on beam of fire that you can toggle on and off.  I have thought of making draconis a jungle hero that spawns a lair on the map and he can always go back to it and when he dies he goes there instead of the fountain I have thought about calling down swarms of dragons or a global finisher akin to invoker's Sun Strike  The list goes on and on!  Here is the problem. Like Katiee posted above, most ideas lack a cohesive role within hon or a purpose in general. Like Katiee dropped some cool stuff on us, but what she posted had no real role or identity, it just does all the stuff! Why does your hero need mana on the blue form and why is he a multi-unit control in the green form, you do know that if you spawn a bunch of stuff people most likely wont want to play your hero and the last thing we want is our only dragon hero to be played as much as our other multi-unit control heroes.  Fire and Flying is a very generic term.  The problem is finding a unique role and niche for this hero so that its not just another ""ranged carry"" ""Nuker"" ""Jungle Ganker"" with Dragon cliches!  Another problem is that everyone has their own view on what a bad ass dragon is. Some people will get royally pissed if it isn't a carry because in their minds a dragon ripping apart his enemies with his claws and dealing massive damage is all they can see. Some people will get mad if its just another ranged carry when they feel that the magic of what a dragon is... WHICH IS ITS MAGIC... is not explored. Some people will get mad if it doesn't fly or breathe fire.  So right now im trying to get a rework ready for this upcoming balance patch because Forsaken Archer is coming and she very much does what Draconis does but better, but im hitting a block because believe it or not there is just too many ideas, and like katiee you want them all and in the end you just have a over complicated mess.  So lastly I decided to go stream-lined and make Draconis a single target (because if its aoe it will overlap with fa and klanx) armor melter (because it makes sense with dragons and we do not have a ranged carry who does that) that is focused on high damage rather than FA or Klanx or just about every other ranged agility carry that just wants attack speed. This to me felt that we could still do something cool and related to dragons while also seperating it enough from the other heroes.  Now that you know where my head is at, lets see what we can come up with, because in the end if we have to hold back draconis so we can do something amazingly cool then thats what we will do.   So my fellow hon players, help us out   PARDON THE WALL OF TEXT!"
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Ripoffs,5,Fri Jul 17 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"The sky is indeed the limit for Draconis! He should be the one flying around, not this ""Klanx"" guy !"
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Deathzthe,7,Thu Jul 16 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with both of klans and draconis have a flying skill. It's like scout, nh and grinex that have inv skill but different style of using the skill.  So my suggestion is Let's have draconis have scout style of invi. I mean just like scout invi that he can stay invi as long as he have mana. let draconis fly as long as he has mana to fly.  Sample  Q: Fly  Toggle to enter Fly mode until it toggled off, you run out of mana. or you attack or cast any skill.  edit: Can Cliffwalking while in fly mode . just like klanx fly mode (Thanks Tartalacame)  Fly mode grants you Fly and 5/10/15/20% movesment speed.  but drains 2/3/4/5 mana per second.  ...............  at least in this way there's no similarity to klanx fly skill to draconis fly skill."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Tartalacame,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"really interesting, but may be giving Draconis also cliffwalking/building walking, etc. otherwise, it'll look a lot like Pestilence's Flight but with a toggle."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,dontragequit,5,Thu Jul 16 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Whatever you guys decide to do, rework the Q. Its god awful, and never have I seen someone say ""oh thats a great skill.""  It heavily disrupts the flow of a teamfight or gank. Pushing away enemies from you or your team is incredibly frustrating to play with.  As a ranged carry you shouldn't be on the front lines anyways pushing heroes away, you should be in the back doing your damage.   Good luck EU."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,breakycpk,8,Thu Jul 16 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with this.  It seems like this ability is almost more frustrating to use for Draconis than actually useful, and that obviously should never be the case.  Abilities having a slight downside because they might be powerful isn't a bad thing, but I don't think that fits the case here."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,BICEPSUPREME,6,Thu Jul 16 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"IMO I think Draconis' Ultimate needs to be a bit more 'dragon-esque'. I feel that a channeled ultimate ""Dragon Breath"" or something like that, that's a straight line 1000 unit nuke and DOT in a path (sort of like Chippers' ult, but with fire), would make the hero a bit more Dragon. If you could imagine a channeled version of Tundra's ult, with a slow + burn, that would be sick.  His current skillset doesn't really allow for much scale-ability, but I feel he would be much more versatile in teamfights with this ability."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,TEAdown,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Solstice ult is similar to that in the fact that it's slow + damage, large cone radius as well.  The burn is different, pretty cool, maybe it can have a stacking dot from his passive and abilities (think pyro, Nvm that's stealing from pyro) lol, think area of effect stack, similar to pyro but aoe."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,WerdsWerth,3,Thu Jul 16 22:38:30 2015 UTC,"Hi! Draconis is kinda my baby, so brace yoself for a wall of text.   that also allows him to push well against buildings.   You guys are implementing a lot of push of late! Deadlift, Skrap, Kane and now draco?   It's a cool idea; give the hero an armor-piercing spell that scales with his attack damage. This makes him rather unique, as players will logically tend away from items like thunderclaw.    Is this the right direction to rework the hero   Yes! Retain his status as a carry, and make him unique from a design perspective. Wza is right, there is a bit of overlap.   Don't take away from what makes Draconis a dragon though, which is his conveyed in his current kit. He's dominant, merciless, and careless about those foolish enough to invoke his wrath. He burns whatever, whenever, wherever. His current kit, turn rate and collision size really convey this! It feels absolutely awesome leaving fire everywhere, you really do feel like a badass dragon.   Naturally there are lot of ways to interpret just how a dragon should ""feel"", this is just my opinion, but a Dragon that is single-target focused just sounds kinda...tame   What types of abilities would you like to see on a dragon hero like Draconis?    Dragons are dazzlingly bright, right. I reckon make Draconis's skin dynamic, like ultimate empath. Humour me: Draconis heats up internally after performing actions and his scales become blindingly bright. I say introduce a new mechanic, by virtue of Draconis's new ability; Prismatic Scale.   Prismatic Scale  stripping his foes of armor adds to his own, buffering his defenses and causing his scales to illuminate blindingly in the light of his flames   grants passive bonuses charge-based on amount of armor taken from enemies activatable   Can be activated to blind all enemies in a massive radius. Doing this whites out the enemies' screens, for a short time. (this will be similar to TDL ulti, except you cannot see anything at all, your screen will be completely white)  I also reckon a Fly spell as suggested a few times would be absolutely awesome."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Epidemilk,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"players will logically shy away from items like thunderclaw    Never happen. The existing Draconis shouldn't buy it and it still happens. Bushwack too, fuck knows why"
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,GnomeAdd,3,Thu Jul 16 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"I had to make an account for this topic! The ideas of melting armor and hoarding gold have both already been mentioned, and mine is somewhat of a marriage between the two.  My idea for a sort of ability I'd like to see on dragon is some sort of interaction with the process of farming itself, like Salomon's Wish for Wealth but turned all the way up to 11. Just off the top of my head, something like a toggle-able passive where, when toggled on, half of all gold gained from non-ancient creep kills would instead go into generating charges which increased armor penetration and damage by, just to spitball a number, .1 and .25 per charge respectively, or maybe something even simpler like a scaling percent increase to damage based on total gold accrued through the game.   Granted, it would be tough to tune the numbers precisely down to a point where this sort of ability would be both fair and impactful/fun, but I think the idea of a dragon using gold to stoke their flames is fukken sweet both flavor and gameplay-wise"
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Aweq,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"I was the guy with the gold idea. What do you think about the where the ""wealth charges"" (generated in fashion similar to what you suggested) could be used to temporarily power up an item in addition to the passive effect?   Something like:  ""Consumes 1 charge per second to increase all damage, armor and attack speed from an item by x/2x/3x/4x % while activated.""  The flavour would be that the item becomes another ""treasure"" in Draconis' hoard."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Aweq,2,Thu Jul 16 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"Considering many of his alternate avatars feature multiple heads, won't some form of multi-strike be needed?   Personally I would find the trope of ""dragon hoarding treasure"" to be an interesting avenue to explore."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,radoncadonk,2,Thu Jul 16 15:25:37 2015 UTC,A gold-related skill or passive would be interesting!
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Aweq,3,Thu Jul 16 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"So to do a bit of brainstormning: We don't want it to be some skill that increases gold gained. Salomon already occupies that niche. Perhaps an ability that simply counted up as Draconis acquires wealth and granted bonuses based. This could be done somewhat like Skrap's E, except without the need to collect objects. Another way of doing it could be that ability scaled with the value of Draconis' items.   If we're pushing design limits a bit, such an ability could increase the power of Draconis by quite a lot when he has acquired a lot of wealth BUT as a downside, some of the wealth e.g. gold would be lost to the opposing team whenever he dies, as to represent slaying the treasure hoarding dragon."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,VeriTota,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:30 2015 UTC,How about relating to a dragon hoard. The more gold he has saved in his stash the more passive armor/attack speed/raw stats he gets. That way he still loses gold like normal from death
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Aweq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:58 2015 UTC,I just don't think having it based on items in stash would be very fun:/ although it is very flavourful!

HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,PM_ME_A_CONVERSATION,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a draconis with an ulti that gave him 4 different forms (1 free starting form, and then 3 additional form every time he leveled his ult)  In his free starting form (fire form), he would be aoe centric (much as he is right now, and allow him to hit multiple targets for 80/70/60/50% reduced damage (depending upon the level of his ulti) that were hit by his spells.  * His Q spell would do aoe damage,  and allow him to attack any target hit by the cone of his Q (excluding those immune to it) for the next 3 seconds (merging his ult into his Q spell a bit here)  * His W spell would do aoe damage as it does now, and allow his attacks to hit any target in range that was standing on his path.  It would no longer give him movespeed or unitwalking.  * His E passive would gain a proc every time he activated a spell (including switching to this form in his ultimate), and would function exactly as it does now.  At level 6, he would gain his wind form, which would be his evasive form.  In this form, he'd gain increased move-speed and magic armor, but reduced HP  * His Q Spell would do an aoe pushback, and give him 3 seconds of invisibility  * His W spell would make him immune to magic, but also unable to attack, and he'd have increased movement speed in this form  * His E passive would give him a passive chance to evade attacks  At level 11, he would gain his water form, which would be a ""carry form.""  He would have additonal attack speed and mana regeneration in this form.  * His Q spell would do an aoe slow, and gives draconis additional attack speed when attacking targets hit by his Q for the next 3 seconds  * His W spell would slow anyone in it, give him their movement speed, and allow him to teleport instantly to where he was when he first cast it, as well as granting him unit walking.  * His E passive would deal DOT to anyone it hits, dealing damage over time to their mana pool and health pool  At level 16, he would gain his stone form, which would be a ""Tank/pushing"" form, in which he would gain increased health, and take reduced 40% reduced damage, but would have reduced attack speed, and be melee  * His Q spell would be an aoe Stun, and grant draconis 3 seconds of increased damage to towers  * His W spell would function as a charge, shooting him forward in a straight line at high movement speeds that would last until he hit into an obstile or unit, or for the duration of the spell.  It would stun on impact.  * His E passive would make him spawn a small golem every 5th attack that would attack that target until one of them died (The golems would last 20 seconds, attack slowly, have 300 health, and crumble whenever their target died)  Important:  His ulti would have a 90 second cooldown, in order to switch through forms yuo would have to rotate through them Fire ---> Wind ---> water ---> stone --->back to fire."

HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,magsy123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love the feel of Draconis. Some things could/should be changed, but I would be sad if the ultimate was reworked. The AOE aspect of the fire-spitting Dragon unleashing carnage just makes so much sense to me.  When people think of Dragons, they think of fire and flight. Currently the only flying hero is Klanx. The W could be changed so Draconis can fly with another activation making him slam down to the ground. This would allow the player to choose between mobility and damage/farming capability.  If you guys want to have Draconis 'melting' armour, it would 'make sense' that it be on a flame breath type mechanic, but could also be added onto his current passive as a stacking effect. Maybe someone can take a slight singing, but the heat of a Dragon should eventually be overwhelming."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,Archdragon1992,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really play anymore, but I loved playing Draconis. I don't really think he should be reworked, well maybe his passive. Also his flight skill is really good but I don't know why a Dragon couldn't fly over obstacles. Don't know if it would make him broken because of that but it would be a great buff to him. His passive is decent for farming and pushing but really bad honestly imo. The trail of fire he leaves behind when flying is a better farming tool than his passive, especially early game."
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,YouWhosay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"Just some ideas:  Q: You spit out a small aoe of napalm(chargebased), centered on a unit(think like chippers tar), but instead of a slow, it lovers the armor off those who have been in contact within a certain timeframe, and while the armormeltingdebuff is active (lets say burning for 5 sec), it will light up scorched areas, for extra armor debuff(see W)  W: Scorch: Every attack and skill you use apply a stacking armor-shred per instant applyant. activate (like vindi) and cost mana/applyant/tree   E: Take off: after a short channel 1 sec(animation of lifting from the ground/landing) you gain everything-walking and a clearvision, dont destroy trees but at a cost of 30% lower atk dmg while airborne. If used in combination of W, the trees you fly over will become scorched for a time (ex 4 mins), so if a unit with scorch debuff comes within a small radius of a scorched area, the whole scorched area goes a flame, applying debuffs to anyone near the area (area denial) cost mana/sec  R: Flametounge: select a target and start attacking it(with your attackdmg) with a flame, reaching your attackrange +150(can be buffed with Wingbow etc), press R to switch target while channeling the duration. you can still move and fly and use your other skills, but as long as you channel you will face the target and will therefore have a MS debuff when moving away from the target, as you are moving/flying Backwards. can be stopped with S or H, and will go on cooldown. Units between you and the target get the Scorch debuff armordebuff.  Well thats my ideas :)  Edited 30% less atk dmg while airborne"

HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,ismaelvera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"Finally a Draconis rework! I'll say what I first said when this hero was released...a Dragon is not an autoattacker...at least not exclusively. Draconis needs to be able to fly, destroy buildings (alternatively gaining gold from destruction), grapple with other heroes, and breath fire. S2 only hit one of these.  I would even consider having Draconis be melee to allow more creativity and power to his design. His Q could be a continuous flame thrower, his W could give him omni walking with a ms boost (true flight) along with a passive that has something to do with seiging buildings, and his E will need to be completely reworked because auto attacker heroes are some of the most boring heroes in Newerth as of this moment. Auto attack reliant hero promote more passive farming play to be able to have a good auto attack, so Draconis should probably be changed to melee. This also goes for his R; it's basically a steroid auto attack spell that was made to synergize with his E, incredibly boring.  Aside from flight and a continuous flame thrower, I can see Draconis grappling another hero somehow, and maybe having a spell that uses his claws as a Dragon Slash maybe."

HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,WerdsWerth,2,Thu Jul 16 18:03:43 2015 UTC,that is an awesome sounding ulti idea!
HeroesofNewerth,3didr6,burlesqueduck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"I would suggest splitting his q into two separate effects, a breathing in skill that in a cone draws enemies in and slows, and a breathing out when re-activated within 5 seconds that pushes enemies away in a different cone and deals fire damage.  If another of his skills then provides mobility such as a dash or if he gets a pk you could even pull the enemy team to your teammates, fly/blink ahead in front of them and push them back to your team.  Furthermore, the passive fiery barrage must absolutely be changed. Not only does it push the lane, its widget prevents camps from spawning.  There are many different directions one could go in with this hero. If an agi ranged carry is wanted, make sure to add lots of mobility. Maybe he could instead become a strong int ganker with a stun, a toggled autoattack modifier and can throws down area denial fires. Or maybe the toughness of a dragon is to be emphasized and he becomes a str ranged semicarry kind of like flux, but then he would need a strong initiation ult to compete.  As for how his flight is handled, I would personally like to see him have a nighthound-like passive ult with different levels, he can terrainwalk as long as he hasnt attacked or has been attached for x seconds, but then with a twist: he can activate it to get out of a sticky situation without having to wait, but the skill won't work until the cooldown has worn off (30ish sec)  whatever you do, remember to at least allow him to burn down trees : P  EDIT: formal description of the passive ult.   Aspect of the dragon: can be upgraded at levels 1, 6, 11 (or 4, 8, 12) as long as this skill is off cooldown, and draconis has not been damaged or has cast a spell or attacked something in 5/3/1 seconds, draconis will be able to fly over all terrain.  When activated, draconis will be able to fly over all terrain and gain a tapering 20% movespeed bonus for 10 seconds (cooldown 30 seconds)  Additionally, when activated, draconis' autoattacks will hit 0/1/2 additional targets, prioritizing enemy heroes."

But what you mentioned about Stay Green playing was the World Finals for HoN Tour Season 2 just for reference"
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,SneezePee,13,Thu Jul 16 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"Hey  So I know that one of my bigger weaknesses always when it comes to casting has been considered to be my camera work.  Hell, there is a joke that I go along with of me always missing the bloodlust kill.  But I do feel that criticism like this, is the same of when I get criticism about how I know nothing about HoN and I am horrible when it comes to analysis.  I feel like there are extreme moments that seem to stick with people, whether it is something they actually watched or just hear from someone else that they then use as a general of ""this is how it must always be"".  I guess what I am getting at is... is it really THAT bad all the time?  I feel like I am usually pretty good at camera work in team fights and catching most of the action, and after more than 5 years I have had a lot of experience and time to better it, and I also feel like I make it look a lot easier then it really is because of that.  I know this possibly makes me sound pretty arrogant, but honestly I feel like this is the truth.  I also want to clarify about how in the past I have had camera persons for honcast... there was only a smaller window of time very early on in the honcast life where the famous dangerousdan was indeed the camera man, but other then that it has always been myself.  Something else to consider here is that its not just someone controlling the camera in game, but its the whole stream itself.  By me doing it, it means only one person needs to worry about the stream as a whole rather than relying on another, which means both time investment and coordination for multiple people rather than just myself.  I am not saying this is perfect, and in a perfect world setup yes I think 100% that having an absolute dedicated camera person would be the most ideal, but so would a studio, so would a producer, so would many other things.  We work with what we got, and right now I think we do a great job of that."
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,breakycpk,9,Thu Jul 16 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"Breaky, in the whole history of HoN, there has been no one more transparent and vocal about the game besides you (Perhaps besides WZA.) Even when someone from S2 or Fb claim they want to be more transparent, those are just words. You don't tell people you are going to be transparent - you just do it. If you have to say you are going to be ""more transparent,"" well you have already lost a little bit of your credibility, especially if you have claimed that the past five or six years.  No one believes it anymore. But in your case, you are transparent, and you don't even claim to be. That deserves respect, man to man.  When someone calls out Honcast on production - you are there with a candid reply. When Fuzi passed away - you were there with a heartfelt response to the community, and now here you are replying at great lengths to a select few individuals that you don't need to, but want to.  Never have I seen anyone from S2 or Fb where someone from the company responds to community feedback as you do and discusses at lengths their personal thoughts revolving around important discussions and happenings in Newerth.    The fact you even went to this length to explain yourself speaks volumes, something I have only seen once or twice in my time in HoN, and that was when S2 was getting ddosd in the summer of 2010, or 2011? It was when Failiken said he would do a better job, yada yada yada... And the other was when HonTour Grand Finals was a massive failure and Milkfat posted about doing a better job.  The thing is people take for granted what you have offered and don't realize the scope of what one man can only do.  To commentate at your level of energy, couple that with being on point with the camera work is going to be extremely difficult.    Anyways, what I am getting at is, it shows you are passionate about your job and often a community figurehead that bridges the corporate face to the people.  I have enjoyed your work immensely, and while I don't say to ignore these people outright, I also say - I don't share the same sentiments as the people posted in this topic.  Your last paragraph, honestly says it all. You are one man, and you can only do so much."
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,dontragequit,7,Thu Jul 16 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, appreciate the kind words, does mean a lot.  I really do look at all feedback I get, whether I actually do respond or not.  It is no secret that forums in general aren't as active as they have been in the earlier history of HoN, so it def doesn't happen as much.  But I will do my best to respond when it does if anything to let the community know that I and others truly are listening."

However, one thing I'll say, I tried casting some scrims and camera + casting is way way harder than it looks."
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,inthe6,10,Thu Jul 16 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"They had one for a while. No idea why that stopped.  However, please be aware that pro HoN is barely the same game you are playing, so it might look like there's about to be a kill in one lane and BAM, bloodlust on the other side of the map.  As I see it, it's just like a lot of smack talk about failed lanes: none of you haters would actually do any better. Even if you could do better on camera, your commentary wouldn't compare."
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,Epidemilk,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:33:00 2015 UTC,what we could do better is focus on map movement while not commentating in order to aid breaky. think most people could do that.

I have never had issue with breaky's camera work, sure there might be a time where he misses the action, but thats few and far between."

HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,StevelandCleamer,2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"I would imagine it would be very difficult for breaky to get his ball rolling when a teamfight breaks out and he doesn't know which heroes the camera is about to follow (in the case of someone else controlling the camera). I do agree though, we're missing out on a lot of action."
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,duckluck11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:33:43 2015 UTC,It'd probably be easier for him to have someone control the camera but I can understand why it'd be annoying. There'd always be moments where he'd want to look at something specific and either he'd be looking at the same camera we are and not be able to control it or he'd have his own screen and what he's talking about wouldn't necessarily match up with what we're seeing.   Personally I like watching what he does with the mouse while he's talking. Either gesturing at something or checking stats. It'd be weird for the mouse and voice to be out of sync.
HeroesofNewerth,3dg3wf,kutuzof,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:43:09 2015 UTC,hes awful and its been known hes awful for years at camera work (albeit improving) but nothing has been done. probably cause of budget. not gonna sugarcoat it. his camera work needs work.  Edit: didn't intend to sound this harsh.

HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,Aventil,11,Wed Jul 15 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"What you call ""nothing fancy"" is a whole lot of work for them. Planning, licensing, API's, product development, testing, maintenance, ...  I'm not aware of any game that has an app like this. And you better bet that's for a damn good reason."
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,Aventil,0,Wed Jul 15 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"Right, so in your opinion we should wait for Dota 2 and LoL to make apps and then realise oh shit, we should make an app, rather than taking the lead and setting new standards? They aren't doing it. That's exactly why we should do it! It'll attract more gamers. I'm not expecting something mind blowing, nor am I expecting it over night but this should at the very least be in the works because it is a great idea and it'll set us apart from the rest. At HoN, we bring quality, not quantity, and what better way to prove that than to have a convenient app that brings HoN with you wherever you go?!"
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,ImNewts,4,Wed Jul 15 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"""Setting new standards"" only works if you have eyes on you; HoN doesn't.  Making an app doesn't attract more players; improving the game does.  Clearly, this isn't so much ""my opinion"" as ""all publisher's opinions"", and for very good reason.  Can you imagine the mockery?   DotA's funded by Valve, LoL has a huge playerbase, and ... HoN has an app to browse content!"
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,stove22,0,Wed Jul 15 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I come up with a suggestion and all you can talk about is the negatives. Even if you can't see it working to attract new players, it still works to give a better experience to existing players. If you can find me one existing HoN player that would rather use their web browser on their phone instead of a dedicated app, I'll side with you. Like I said, I'm not expecting something overnight. If it takes months of slow and steady progress due to time allocation then so be it. It's a great idea."
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,jjb985,4,Wed Jul 15 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Web browser. I have for years,theres nothing wrong with it. It works great especially since not many people really use the forums anyway."

HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,jjb985,3,Wed Jul 15 21:50:11 2015 UTC,When people mention popular mobas why does HoN never make the list? I having played them all and playing dota 1.0 religiously know where the genre came from and know that as they all sit HoN is the highest skill and closest clone to the origins yet people go ape shit over a cartoon LoL with no denies and barely any skill shots or dota 2 which just feels very slow paced and I couldn't get into it like I did dota 1.
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,evilguy352,2,Wed Jul 15 13:48:51 2015 UTC,Because HoN is only popular in Thailand lol/dota 2/hots/smite are all much more popular in the west which is were the media is focused on.
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,Epidemilk,3,Wed Jul 15 16:18:58 2015 UTC,It's just so shocking.  It's an amazing moba. Skill shots make mobas fun and with every character rehaul they ate doing away with dd spells ie: hell bringer is fun as shit to play now
HeroesofNewerth,3dddsc,jjb985,0,Wed Jul 15 17:49:20 2015 UTC,HoN WAS big once. but s2 just couldnt handle there own fucken greed and stupidity. For real have a look at the absolutely fucking astounding amount of retardation that they have pulled off. Because of that people dont wanna come back and new people will see that same shit and just go to one of the other million mobas these days. It doesnt matter what they do now. HoN will never be big again. It had its chance and it blew it fucken hard. all we can hope for is just a bit more time for the servers to stay up these days. The only reason i still play this game is because of the time and money i have already put in. I dont even fucken enjoy it anymore.

HeroesofNewerth,3dc55t,FB-Paranoid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:33 2015 UTC,Lies. My ticket has been sitting there for well over a day and no response yet.
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,WerdsWerth,5,Tue Jul 14 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"Sure. There's been a bit of discussion in the Balance Discussion subforum already about this.  I'll give the same response I gave in that thread initially to clear up a few misconceptions, and add a few new things. Just keep in mind that the majority of my post was made before patch 3.7.0 was released, so some things look a bit outdated here - but they do show the line of thinking without hindsight being applied.   I need to clear up some potential misconceptions here.  First of all, a ""rework"" is a broad term in general and can range from changing 1 skill's mechanics enough to the point where its general ""feel"" changes, to complete differences in 1 or more skills, to the hero's mechanical attributes (including attack range, BAT, attack point etc.), and of course to the point where the hero is completely different. In other words, the extent of a ""rework"" is ultimately unknown to the public, though I can drop hints here and there.  In the case of Balphagore's rework, the main issue is simply micro and E. Even though minion micro typically grants a hero a higher skill cap, it's also a barrier to newer or more inexperienced/casual players playing him. A lot of design rework does not focus exclusively on balance, but rather on the function of the hero, their niche, how flexible they can and are intended to be, and whether they are ultimately playable and actually want to be played or not. This is the same premise for the future Tundra, KotF, etc., reworks in terms of their pets. That being said, you do not know to what extent the skill is worked.  I can tell you now that at the moment, Wildsoul will still keep Booboo because the skill is so iconic to the hero. Our aim for him is to make micro less of a ""must"", essentially. That being said, proper micro still rewards the player for higher level play.    Another issue that you brought up is essentially ""Why rework heroes that are considered 'fine'?"" Well, some heroes can be considered ""fine"". That doesn't mean that they can't have a few things redesigned to make them 1) more fun to play (I am aware this is subjective), 2) have an impact on the game that further differentiates them from other heroes (emphasizing their niche) and 3) potentially opens up a wider variety of playstyles for the hero.  Just because a hero is ""fine"" in terms of balance does not mean they are meeting the design expectations. In short, balance and design are actually heavily linked, and while conventional balancing can fix most heroes if their design and concepts are solid, sometimes a design change is the best way to go. It makes heroes different from each other and gives them a reason to be picked in specific scenarios over other heroes. There are so many conventional babysitters with traits that make them strong, but sometimes a ""weird"" hero (at first) is later discovered. A good example of this is Empath - I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on why.     Of course, we are aware of certain repercussions when performing a rework. There will always be people who like a certain hero just because of who that hero is, either it be their skills, their playstyle or simply the appearance and subjective ""feel"" of the hero. So whenever we consider reworking a hero, we always take it seriously."
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,ElementUser,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"What're your thoughts from a design/lore perspective on making Draconis more single target focused then?  What's your take on his ""subjective feel""?"
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,ElementUser,2,Tue Jul 14 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"I might consider making a new thread for that then. Draconis was never a hero I really liked as he is on retail, so the sky is the limit for any kind of rework for him - in my opinion only though.  So at the time being, I don't have much of an opinion on him. Perhaps as time passes by though."

HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Ahimtar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:58 2015 UTC,He is quite far from a Jakiro port imho. And Jakiro is technically a chimaera :D
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,S2-wza,5,Wed Jul 15 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"Just to kind of add to this conversation. HoN had an extended period where we were putting out heroes every 2 weeks with a small number of designers. This caused a lot of hero designs to suffer. Now, when I say suffer I dont mean that we didnt make perfectly fun heroes. I mean that design-wise the rush of deadlines left some heroes in bad situations: overlap with others or lacking a strong role.  Draconis was one of those heroes. Draconis has overlapped with Forsaken since they both existed. This also hurt FA, as people who wanted her style could get that in another hero. This watering down of the hero pool is not healthy for game play and diversity.   We determined that FA would be a better choice for maintaining that AOE carry play-style while Draconis could be re-imagined. We looked at the pool and saw that HoN doesn't have a ranged agility carry that excels at tearing away armor. That helped us split these two heroes; FA will be the go-to for 'AOE magic damage carry' and Draconis will be the go-to 'ranged armor melter'. Draconis will also be one of the few ranged agility carries that wont rely on attack speed to carry, rather focusing on pure damage.   Ideally, at the end of our overhaul of the entire hero pool will be better positioned so that overlap will not be a major concern."
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,DrawnFallow,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:05 2015 UTC,Yer the man. Where's wza? Right fucking here.
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Hinko,2,Tue Jul 14 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"I am really excited for these reworks.  Draconis is a hero that I have tried really hard to like since the beginning because I love his theme and his alt avatars, but the hero never really clicked with me. I'm hoping the rework will improve my enjoyment of playing him.  FA is a hero that I do currently love playing, but some of her skills just feel overly weak now compared to so many other ranged carries. I'm hoping the reworks will keep her playstyle feeling the same, but with a buff in power level to make her competitive again."
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Reddia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"Still think it's best to buy attack speed (read: Agility) item's because it's better than just raw damage, you gain attack speed, damage AND armour instead of just raw damage. Wingbow/genjuro will make any agi hero do more dps than Riftshards/savage + give you more survivability/utility. I also really don't see why lowering armour has anything to do with raw damage being better. Mind explaining?"

HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Frietjeman,2,Tue Jul 14 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Salomon rework made me really sad. I loved the old Salomon, and from what I recall he was nowhere near overpowered. The new Salomon should just have been a different hero.   Every player has a certain set of Heroes they enjoy playing because the niche role appeals to them. When you rework a Hero, you remove one of those niches, and thusly remove an incentive for the players who liked that niche to keep playing.  I honestly think reworks are bad for the game."
HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Epidemilk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Old Salomon was awesome. New Salomon is like my Scout.

HeroesofNewerth,3d9ias,Tartalacame,0,Tue Jul 14 19:15:53 2015 UTC,The old Salomon was way too much powerful. Don't you remember his burst+heal and his speed trail ? You were able to outrun Rampage and be almost on par with Blitz ! All along with a skill build very devastating.

HeroesofNewerth,3d4uh1,VHD_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:24:21 2015 UTC,To make it worst. Most of Draconis alt avatar have two heads. The theme of the hero / alt avatar will become waste after the said rework.
HeroesofNewerth,3d4uh1,BMN12,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:32 2015 UTC,Not really - you could easily have multiple heads attacking the same target imo...

I chose Maps, since I'd worked enough on heroes and balance at S2, and also since no one else at Riot wanted to work on it. Initially I worked primarily on the remake of Twisted Treeline, but as our team grew, I also worked on Proving Grounds, Howling Abyss, and the new Summoner's Rift. Halfway through my time there, I made a small career shift towards user experience, interface, and interaction design and did less and less gameplay work. I also worked closely with the Skins team, as well as a few other teams that needed gameplay/UX oversight. The last thing I worked on that went into the game is their recent HUD rework.  Most of the actual things people attribute to me there (e.g. anything with champions or items) had nothing to do with me--including the Nome's Wisdom item and any champion reworks)."

Can we have some update on the RAP system? this old system was used by S2, it wasent effective then, but now it has gone corrupt. If you notice on their fourm, there are many complaints regarding it but the mods simply close them and turn a blind eye.   My personal experience - I was in a pub game with a raging host and 3 other players. The host flamed all game and threatens he will ban us because he is a friend with GM. After 15 min we all voted surrender but the host refused to surrender and tells all in chat that he refused to cc because he want make our life miserable and suffer longer, so 4 of us refused to play and just afked in fountain. After the game ends I closed the pc, and the next day I got 1 week ban.  So what logic is there on the punishment? If I decide to leave, I get 1 leave count. If I afk for a game IN PUB after 15 Minutes with 3 other players in a unwinnable, unfun and unfriendly game with an autistic host, I get 1 week ban?   Also, the system. The GM have way too much powers, is it true that they cant even see game chat? Since all they can do is download the replay which have no chat in it. Having a non-staff handling out 1 week ban is hurting the community and player play-time, forcing these people to either stop or smurf, and smurfing itself is bad for new player experience"

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,brandlor,5,Thu Jul 9 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to have proof that something didn't happen in a closed community.  Unless you're part of S2 or a GM, you don't have access to the RAP records.  How are you supposed to get proof?"
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,-6,Thu Jul 9 21:40:55 2015 UTC,My point is making that claim without proof that nothing happens is quite a claim to make.  You are correct in saying that there is not public access to all the RAP statistics and that may be something that we should begin looking into but I know for a fact that we ban accounts based on RAP reports so his point that nothing happens is wrong.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,brandlor,3,Thu Jul 9 21:53:08 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with that fact.  I was a GM and did ban people.   I'm merely pointing out that it would be very difficult for him to have proof unless he was a GM or a part of S2.  I also agree that posting what happened to the RAP reports you submit might help.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,pribnow,9,Thu Jul 9 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"If I was banned for every time someone reported me, or claimed to have reported me, i'd have as many bans as I have games. Similar for the reporting I do and I use that sparingly i.e. only in cases of clear cut, obviously bannable abuse. However what OP did is not clear cut abuse.  My issue isn't with punishment, its that a group of people selectively act only seemingly out of spite. Additionally, to me what he did isn't wrong. You call it ""racist griefing"" (despite that race != ethnicity, but why let details get in the way) but I don't see it that way. I see it as a player exercising their non-bannable right to leave a game and requeue.   If he was playing on US servers, why should he have to play with 4 people who don't understand him and make no effort to? (inserting my own personal experiences with full BR teams) He doesn't have to play period, whatever reason he chooses to leave is his own. I'm very curious to know where in the rules that what he did was wrong and to be shown this is not some subjective interpretation by a mod."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,GoodHunter,2,Thu Jul 9 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"Not to mention in cases where they had to leave due to other reasons. Let's say friends are waiting outside for him to come out and they don't want to wait? Or the game went longer than expected, and he or she is late for something? Do these people get banned even though it wasn't out of any mal intent, griefing, hating, etc?"

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Hey reddit and TrollHouseCookie,  Allow me to shed some light on the situation.    Upon entering the game TrollHouseCookie notices that we are staff and instantly types that he'll be leaving the game because he is facing staff members.  Taking action on this statement, which he did, was seen as griefing staff members.  The second reason he left was due to his teammates being non-english speaking.  Leaving due to that was seen as racist griefing.  The reason we have a leaver percentage is to allow leeway for people who have emergencies come up or have internet connection issues and cannot get back into the game for whatever reason.  Leaving a game solely based off who you're facing and who is on your team, in this case, was considered griefing.    Lastly, after looking into his account there was a distinct history of being banned mostly due to griefing.  Knowing this, we felt that our decision on this certain situation was the correct one.  Edit: The ban was only followed through with after a customer support representative found that TrollHouseCookie already had two accounts with 6 month bans.  Whenever that is the case, a full ban on all of a player's accounts is implemented."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Nightblade96,28,Thu Jul 9 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but this has got to be the dumbest reason to ban someone.  As long he said nothing distinctively racist or any outright in-game griefing like feeding on purpose or killing the courier there's no reason for him to be banned, especially since he wasn't dodging the AFK detection either.  Griefing because he didn't want to play against staff members? What? Do staff members get some sort of special ""you must play with us or get banned"" rule? What make them so special that you can't even leave against them? Or if I encounter pro-players in a match then declare that I do not want to play against pro-players before leaving count as griefing pro-players?  And leaving because his team was non-english speaking? Lol... that's quite a valid reason if he's playing on a US servers and couldn't communicate with his team. Did he say anything actually racist or are you just basing off assumptions?  Leaver percentage is basically MADE for situations like this. If he decide to leave the game for ANY reason at all, despite his reasonings, he should have the right to do so as long he did not avoid AFK detection.  And how the hell does his previous offenses have to do with anything? Repeated offenses should only count for the severity of the  punishment and not as a reason for the punishment."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,8,Fri Jul 10 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you stated that way better than I could have."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,phforNZ,-3,Fri Jul 10 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"Previous punishments actually have a lot to do with it.  In this case, two of his accounts were already on 6 month bans.  When this is the case, we ban all of said person's accounts.  So he should've already been banned prior to this engagement, he was just unfortunate enough to make himself visible to people who can take action on that.  It's like a bank robber getting caught speeding by a cop, when the cop checks his record he takes more action than simply giving him a speeding ticket."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Psy_Kira,5,Fri Jul 10 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm sorry I griefed you guys based on your definition posted above. I probably should have just left without saying anything.

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,8,Sat Jul 11 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"leaving because he's unable to communicate with his team, in a team based game, where communication is vital, is seen as racism?

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Psy_Kira,8,Fri Jul 10 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"He got banned because it was FB staff that wanted to feel some power, any other reason is just bullshit, everyone knows it. This ""looking into his account there was a distinct history of being banned mostly due to griefing.."" is just a pathetic attempt at trying to justify this. Also what does it matter what his history is like? Also i have reported countless games where someone was super griefing against me and nothing happened.    Hugely disappointed to read that."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,-3,Fri Jul 10 10:52:42 2015 UTC,"I have no reason to feel power.  I play HoN like all of you and I deal with all of the same problems that you deal with.  I've had plenty of games with griefers and leavers and have suffered through plenty of 4v5s.  The only difference is that I can see into someone's history and, unfortunate for him, TrollHouseCookie's history showed that he deserved punishment as explained in a post above."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,SteamRiC,7,Fri Jul 10 14:17:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, so let me get this straight. TrollHouseCookie got in a game with yall and he didnt feel like playing with you so he left the game, he didnt insult anyone or did any serious offense, he simply wrote that he is in a game with staff and in a team that is typing in non-english language and said ""byee.."" and left. Now that is not a bannable offense since you know, thats why we have leaver system for. However, you must have felt something (like a rage) that got you into looking at his account and you saw that he had 'bad' history, so you gave him a ban. You see dude, thats not how this is suppose to work! You dont ban people for leaving game, you ban them for doing bannable offense, meaning that if TrollHouseCookie did something deserving a ban he should have been banned for that. And YOU claim RAP system works, meaning that he was either alrdy banned for his past stuff or someone decided he didnt deserve it. In both cases this ban he got now is because he LEFT a game and that pissed off someone with power to ban people."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,CaptainAmerican,-5,Fri Jul 10 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"He wrote that he was going to leave game purely because he was facing staff.  You don't consider that griefing?    Even if you don't consider that griefing, I look up people's accounts all the time, mostly to help them out, give them a few extra coins, or maybe even add an avatar to their account.  Now do you get upset when that happens?  Is that abusing my power?  I think the most applicable example is the one i've already used but you've seemed to overlook.  If a murderer gets pulled over for an illegal lane change and the cop looks up his information and sees he's committed a crime prior to this small incident, the cop will take action.  TrollHouseCookie made himself visible to those who can take action  by griefing and thus his  previous crimes came to light."

Do you want them to avoid afk detection and/or purposely feed for the remainder of the game?   A person doing something that you don't agree with isn't griefing. Purposely fucking up others' game is. People talk all kinds of shit on the internet.. Majority of the leave/afk ""threats"" are just to make whoever makes them look cool.. If someone says: ""I'm gonna jungle"" and then decide it's better not to jungle, would you ban them as well?   From the RAP subforum:  •Examples of what is NOT considered AFK Abuse •Successfully getting kicked by an AFK vote •Being flagged as AFK but never kicked •Refusing to kick an AFK player, even if that player is a friend •Farming continuously with the intentions of helping to win the match •Legitimately going AFK but match ends before getting flagged •Legitimately going AFK but an ally moves your hero with an ability/item •Disconnecting    Leaving has never been bannable. A few years ago it was even said by sgm-s on rap forums. If you are going to make up some random new rules then at least let players know about it.

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,ploopy07,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:28 2015 UTC,What's wrong is verbally saying why. You can discriminate as long as you don't tell everyone you're doing it. He was effectively taunting them into banning him.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Epidemilk,5,Thu Jul 9 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"What? No he wasnt! Everyone has a right to leave a game for whatever reason they want and it shouldnt be bannable. That reason can be ""my cat is on fire""  or ""i dont feel like playing with you guys"", in both cases you get a penalty for leaving a mach in form of Leave%. He didnt grief by calling anyone racist, hurtful names.. If he really got banned for leaving a game because he didnt feel like playing with FB staff that werent even communicating in english... thats just stupid."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Represented,-7,Fri Jul 10 10:47:27 2015 UTC,"As I explained, this was not the reason why Leaver % was introduced.  It was introduced to provide a leeway for users who have irl emergencies or have internet issues, not for griefing the other team."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Epidemilk,3,Fri Jul 10 14:22:35 2015 UTC,Yeah what about people who fucking leave and join another game? Shouldn't they be instant banned? Are you guys like... seriously fucking stupid or what?
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Tartalacame,11,Sat Jul 11 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"This is actually horrible reasoning because you made the strange assumption that he left because he was trying to grief you. How is leaving because there are people that are impossible to communicate with racist? If he doesn't feel like he wants to play with people that will not do anything he says because they can't understand him, why is that bannable? HoN is a team game and if you can't work with your team what is wrong with not playing at all since it'll result in the same outcome (a loss). This so wrong I don't even know what to say.  So if he said ""I'll be leaving this game because my Mom is in the hospital and I need to see her"" instead of ""I'll be leaving this game"" he wouldn't be banned? What bullshit."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,foodbattle,3,Thu Jul 9 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"So is RAP going to consider the chat more often?

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,MagicUhu,4,Fri Jul 10 14:58:45 2015 UTC,that ban reason makes no sense just like other decesions coming from FB-that no one else agrees with
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,ElMadridista,-4,Fri Jul 10 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear you elaborate on that foodbattle, which decisions do every one else disagree with?  As with anything, I'm always happy to talk out any decision we make and explain why we did it."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,S2AceJR,5,Fri Jul 10 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"So a FrostBurn member in this case AceJr and his colleagues, experienced first hand the repercussions of how foreign players negatively impact the enjoyment for native speaking English players.    You ban the guy because he leaves not wanting to play against staff/teammates that can't speak english. As you mention TrollHouseCookie has a history of bannings under his account, which doesn't help your argument, but since you bring it up, have you ever considered that perhaps TrollHouseCookie did everyone a favor in that game? Since he does have a history of bannable behavior, perhaps if he stayed in that game despite his displeasure, he may have turned out to be a far greater detriment to the players in that game instead if he had stayed.    This is more on you the Frostburn team than any wrong doing from TrollHouseCookie for your negligence to the NA player base needs and HoN players as a whole. Had you acted upon the needs of the many disgruntled players and customers you would have fixed this issue a long time ago.  This would be a non issue if you provided competent and basic match making services for your game.  Other Mobas have matchmaking settings where you can choose the region and language preference you want your teammates to have. These are bare minimum requirements in today's Moba and can arguably combat griefing and toxicity.  Something that you have ignored to implement in your decrepit aging game.  It's a shame actions like these really tarnish the many good faces of FrostBurn.   I can't say I am shocked by this behavior nor can I say TrollHouseCookie deserves to be banned.  You have the power and means to do whatever you want with your game - even unjust bannings in this case - but that power is being used in all the wrong places.  I see 3000 people on patch nights in America/EU/LAT/Aus.    The change from S2 -> FrostBurn hasn't meant much.  Whats that famous saying? You can't put lipstick on a pig etc etc. Good luck with your remaining HoN customers on the international client."

I 100% disagree with this.  I see this as an English speaking player ruining the experience for 9 other people. You keep trying to throw the blame other places but in reality the only person that ruined the experience was the person who left the game."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,31sualkatnas,7,Fri Jul 10 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"just remake then. thats the main problem in this game. if someone disconnects at the beginning of the game why not just remake. queue times arent that long these days, at least in my bracket. so whats the deal i dont get it. you played the game, got salty and abused your power."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Epidemilk,4,Fri Jul 10 14:47:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. He was pissed that he didn't get to pubstomp a team who can't communicate and abused his power as a GM. Then came up with the racism thing to cover his ass - so transparent.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,aeperez94,-5,Fri Jul 10 15:18:31 2015 UTC,This doesn't even make sense.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Pomme_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"If TrollHouseCookie was playing in the US server, I see it more as ruining his game experience than the foreign players experiences. There different servers for a reason, and if I cannot communicate in English in the US servers, that's a problem that shouldn't be happening. Let's say the reason why the foreign players are coming into US servers is because of issues with their own servers ... then wouldn't that in the end be the responsibility of FB? And I sincerely doubt that the issue is the lack of players, as I always seem to get 50% latino or BR players in every game, which should mean they have enough people to play on their own servers. Try taking a poll from the HoN community regarding whether they would like to play with people that they cannot communicate at all with. You'll probably find that the vast majority of players would much rather not. This cannot be considered racism, it's more logic than racism. Unless the players started spewing hate chat, it cannot ever be racism. I don't know where you guys are going with all of this, but it seems like you prefer to stick with your stance despite all the flak you're getting from the majority of people here. This sincerely worries me and gives off messages."
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,dontragequit,-7,Tue Jul 14 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"Well, seems like you did the right thing :)   (Now if you could do that with all the other griefers ;) Kappa)"
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,SteamRiC,-6,Thu Jul 9 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Set the story straight, good man!"
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Pomme_,-8,Thu Jul 9 22:24:58 2015 UTC,totally agree on this decision. This kind of behaviour should result in a ban.
HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,SteamRiC,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:28:08 2015 UTC,"Hello TrollHouseCookie,  The 6months suspensions you are currently experiencing are the direct result of your past and current suspension.  You received a total of 18 suspensions and proceeded to grief on a basic account.  Note that basic accounts are considered throw away accounts ( see this thread for more informations : http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?537684-Under-the-roof-of-the-RAP-system&highlight=roof) The longest active suspension which was 6 months issued on the 2015-07-02 was thus shared on the alternate accounts you were using.

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,Epidemilk,3,Sat Jul 11 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"This thread isn't about ""should mr TrollHouseCookie be banned?"".  If he really is griefing then ban him for griefing. The issue is that he got banned for leaving, which is not a reason for a ban.   Just admit that you guys fucked up with this match and that's it... Whenever you fuck up, you just make excuses like now (find another match to say that someone really did deserve a ban), or you just don't say anything (if you really belive you have fucked up)"

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,CaptainAmerican,3,Sat Jul 11 18:04:43 2015 UTC,Mods don't care about this game.  They  sell put to get a higher population even though most of these accounts don't even buy coins. Instead of focusing on making a he game better as a product to attract players  they focus on making it easier and more welcoming to new players. A game that is six years old they are dumbing down for the loyal players who have spent hundreds just to be fucked by brs and the shitty gms that are fucking terrible at this game mind you.  I always know it's a free win when I play them.    This game has become if you don't team queue just expect to lose and maybe you'll get lucky if you win.

HeroesofNewerth,3cp2p8,STDs4YouAnd4Me,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"hon community will always be the same, huh? I am playing this game for five years and in my first couple years when we joined a game with my friends(we didnt know english) I still can remember how many teammates left the game because we can't speak.  even now whenever I join a game with non english speaker friends we %99 hear bad words from teammates or form opponents or when I join a game alone I still get abused even in picking phrase because of my flag I put on my profile. They swear to my nationality or to me whenever they get killed, whenever I can't help them, whenever they got bored.  these were just what's inside me. but in this case as gm's said he already has two 6 months ban.  as you can see in the link:  ""Case 1 : Player B made an account for the sole purpose of griefing, or logged on to an old throw-away account for the sole purpose of griefing.  Result: This account will receive a 6 month suspension and his main will be suspended for the same duration as the original suspension was. Player B then decides it was enough and doesn’t grief anymore, nothing else will be done to him.  Case 2 : Player B made an account for the sole purpose of griefing, or logged on to an old throw away account for the sole purpose of griefing and was already suspended for a similar behavior. Result: All of his accounts will be eligible for a 6 month suspension or a Permanent suspension.""  especially this part:""Player B then decides it was enough and doesn’t grief anymore, nothing else will be done to him.""  my point is, if you already got banned for 6 months in two different accounts and you decide to open another one. you simply stay away from anything connected to griefing. Writing that  :oh. fb staff, im leaving the game then  :<insert non english sentence here> :this is my whole team :bye is actually a lot to do with griefing. If it was your first account and you had a clear RAP history, you would get very little punishment. but repeating these accounts will get you banned more and more.   you dont have to agree with me but if something important happens or your plans changes you simply write ""sorry i have to go"" or you dont have to write anything but you just leave. this is not griefing since you dont always do it. but when it comes to a case like this and you leave the game just because there are staff team in front of you and your teammates doesnt speak english, that totally is griefing.   you community, made me write something that long with my bad english... :D I hesitated to post because I know I probably made a lot of mistakes but who cares :P"

HeroesofNewerth,3cg1p3,sparr,7,Tue Jul 7 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Hey I totally get where you're coming from. It takes a while to learn the synergies and combinations of heroes, let alone items. HoN is very unforgiving, especially when it takes one single action to win or lose a teamfight.  On the flip side, as a more frequent player, I do have to point out that you can actually search for heroes during the picking stage (top right corner), which can solve this particular problem of yours:   If someone on my team tells me to pick X hero, I have to hover over a bunch of them to find it by name.   I've had too many teammates random doing exactly what you said, when this can easily be avoided by using the search function."

HeroesofNewerth,3c6jgd,FusenMusen,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty retarded to witch hunt scammers and acc boosters when a large portion of the ""Professional players"" who's cocks will get sucked do the exact same thing. Guarantee someone like xibbe has boosted/sold far more accounts than calvin park. And there are many more account boosting or account selling pros on every team, but I won't say their names since xibbe is the only one who is public/known about it.   That said, for some reason I'm being implicated for things I said in 2013 in that thread, so I'll clear the air: Calvin used to sell accounts. That's it. I am not aware of any scamming involved with that, one way or another.  Continuation, some reason people are implicating me and saying that I am part of this honcoin nonsense when I was the only streamer to immediately call it out as a scam both on my stream AND towards the guy who messaged me where other streamers both used it and said it worked and/or put it on their stream (temporarily)  http://i.imgur.com/RVozH3Q.png  Additionally, there is literally 0 proof of this being calvin's doing. This is literally a bunch of people who don't like what calvin did in the past (and neither do I, as you can see in the heroesofnewerth thread) and blaming him for some new site LITERALLY OUT OF COINCIDENCE with no evidence.  Finally, I think this is doxxing/witch hunting which is 100% against reddit rules and this thread should be deleted.  edit seems there is scamming evidence that is on the honcoin thread that I wasn't aware of at first."

HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,OnRampage,10,Sun Jul 5 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"Just some comments from me:   For some reason the spot 4 and 5 in the inventory are not affected by smartcast.   This is a bug and is fixed internally (should go live in the near future).  For all spellcasts (particularly those with instant cast action times, e.g. Portal Key) and why this doesn't work like in other games (e.g. League of Legends), players forget one tiny detail: your hero's facing has to be within 180 degrees of the target location/target unit to actually cast the spell.  So in that Portal Key example in your video, Legionnaire didn't actually fulfill that condition. In League of Legends, Flash would have activated because heroes (champions) essentially have an infinite/instant turn rate.   For the Legionnaire Taunt-after-PK example: the issue could have easily been solved if you shift-queued the Taunt spell instead of using Taunt outright because you forgot about the angle facing requirement. You canceled Portal Key's command in the ""order queue"" when you did this. Note that you get the same result if a person does what you did in that video without smartcasting if you press Taunt fast enough after pressing Portal Key and Portal Key hasn't actually activated yet. The results just naturally occur more often in this scenario with smartcasting because smartcasting saves a keypress, which reduces the delay between commands.  The other thing is that, like the other games, smartcast activates when you take your finger off the ability hotkey.  If you really want it to activate when you press the hotkey down, rather than releasing the hotkey, then you can try this in the console:   cg_smartcastingButtonUp false   A fair warning though, this means you can't change your mind when you cast a spell and think it will whiff, meaning it will get used unless it has a cast time that you can cancel. You can always change back the settings by changing the console command to ""true"" instead.  In short: other than the further customization of smartcast (and the actual bugs), there are no technical issues with smartcast and it's working as intended. The thing is that HoN's angle-facing mechanic for spellcasts make it a little less useful in this game because you expect something to be instant when it's not in some cases. At the moment, the angle-facing mechanic has to work for smartcast too, otherwise smartcast would give a subtle (but significant) objective & mechanical advantage compared to those who don't use smartcast."
HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,ElementUser,2,Sun Jul 5 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"I appriciate the feedback, but this is not a problem with the direction of the hero. In this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZcGUSgELkM&feature=youtu.be   you can see that the items does not proc, even through i activate it, because I press right click, before it goes off, no matter the direction of the hero.  I doubt that is intentional, since you often spam right click to walk, making this happen quite often."
HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,ElementUser,3,Sun Jul 5 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Right now, that sounds intentional to me because you're cancelling the PK queue with a movement command. See my response below, it is the accurate answer.  I'll take a look at it later to maybe replicate it and get the timing to replicate this scenario and determine whether it's buggy behaviour or not, then see if it happens to spells or not (AFAIK spells don't get cancelled by movement commands, but I need to actually check).  So this comment isn't actually conclusive of anything yet, just to let everyone know."
HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,ElementUser,2,Sun Jul 5 15:30:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, if it is meant to be made that way, I rest my case. I tried it out without smartcast, and you can cancel it, the difference however is that when using smartcast, for some reason the time you can cancel items such as pk queue is a lot larger than when clicking yourself, at least it seems so to me.   Further update: The probably is no difference, it is just easier to rightclick fast when using smartcast."
HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,astro_nova,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay I know why it's happening. When you slow the game down in Practice Mode, you'll end up noticing that your right-clicks actually cancel your smartcast because right-clicking while your spellcast cursor is ""out"" will cancel the spellcast from happening if you haven't ""left-click ordered"" it to be cast. So it's not that you're right-clicking before or after the Portal Key command (because it has a cast time of 0 when you're facing the target direction), it's because you're right-clicking within the timeframe when the PK smartcast hotkey is ""held down"" but not released yet. This cancels your PK smartcast order. It is difficult to notice this bug in regular game speed because a player thinks that they're letting go of their smartcast hotkey before the right-click actually occurs, when that may not be the case.  It's an intended mechanic because this is how one would cancel their spell from being cast if they were to change their mind before issuing the left-click confirmation to cast it.  Unfortunately, all of these phenomena happens because of how HoN works. Sorry :(. You are correct in that because smartcast is made to make casts feel faster, you'll run into the ""right-click cancel problem"" that you've outlined in a previous post because your right-clicks are more likely to overlap with the smartcast hotkey timeframe. Without smartcast activated, a player is likely to execute their moves more sequentially, rather than running the risk of right-clicks interfering with their command queue. In situations without smartcast activated, right-click commands are always executed before or after an intentional spellcast/item usage command, rather than being mixed into the command usage timeframe.  I don't think anyone would want HoN heroes to have instant turn rates either, otherwise people would perceive it as ""another change that copies LoL""."
HeroesofNewerth,3c705s,ElementUser,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. With this information, smartcasting can still be used, but you need to know to stop your right clicking spree when walking to use pk. Sorry for the dramatic title, I was a bit heated, due to this ""bug"". I'm glad I know this now, but I do think that it would be an idea to elaborate on it in-game, as I think other people might also encounter this."

HeroesofNewerth,3c3dbt,ploopy07,4,Sat Jul 4 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"Playing against a suicide Kinesis ususlly requires 2 strong laners including a support with lockdown (ex. Rhapsody + Puppet Master or Glacius + Swiftblade). A lane like Moira Magebane will almost be impossible to win/box out a good Kinesis player. Lane control is top priority vs Kinesis since the hero has no inherent escape. Counterwarding the pull is necessary, along with removing of any vision he has. A roaming jungler like an Ophelia or Parasite can also lead very easy kills on Kinesis. A Kinesis with no vision or lane control is basically dead with a stun."

HeroesofNewerth,3c3vz7,PeenoyDoto,5,Sat Jul 4 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"There are some unreliable sources like this (undeleted thread) that claims that S2 sold off the IP of Savage.  Savage is freeware but the intellectual property still belongs to a company. That company can choose to make Savage 3 for example. Savage 1 was also freeware when Savage 2 was released. If S2 owns Savage and they decide to make a sequel there would be a conflict. They cannot share the same universe. One of them has to change the lore. They are independent companies and using other companies' IP can lead to lawsuits.   I would also assume that S2 owns Savage. It is just unusual that there are a few unverified former S2 employees claiming Savage IP was sold off. Also the fact that Savage and HoN share the same universe makes it a bit unusual.  But there is no reliable source that states Frostburn Studios or S2Games owning Savage. If you visit S2Games website there is no mention of Savage. But their website isn't accurate as well since they listed HoN as their game.  Possible answers are:     Frostburn Studios aquired Savage series S2 still owns Savage series and they have an agreement with Frostburn Studios about the universe; Savage is still connected to HoN (that also means both studios aren't fully independent) S2 still owns Savage series and they have an agreement with Frostburn Studios of HoN changing the universe in the future (unlikely but it can happen; see Dota 2 heroes changing lore because of Blizzard (Windrunner Windranger, Skeleton King Wraith King, ...)

HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,dontragequit,2,Fri Jul 3 23:51:38 2015 UTC,Switch chat over to whispers. Saves me so many headaches even though I'm not a scrub anymore.
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,Oh_A_Mother_Knows,3,Sat Jul 4 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"Let's start saying that everytime, you get matched with 9 smurfs who expect anyone else in the game, even if you are not a smurf like them, to know everything about the game and have no interest in teaching you something   That is a misconception. There are not that many smurfs in 1400s to 1599 as many players seem to believe. It's true however that there is a lot of flaming and expectations are very high even from players who underperform themselves.  It may sound harsh but if you are unable to laugh off silly insults, the game is not for you. If you want to try more, the mute function helps you silence annoying players. Be aware that quite some players are frustrated with underperformance and will yet try to win the game with you if you accept that you play bad. But some people are quite annyoing, mute and report them."
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,DamnThatsLaser,3,Fri Jul 3 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"I love that he said he's not complaining that the game is hard to learn, but claiming that there are 8-9 smurfs in every 1500 game.  I think it is very easy to make a conclusion from those two facts."
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,conningcris,2,Fri Jul 3 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, being a brand new 1500 player and being a 1500 player with 1000 games is pretty damn different."
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,HighVoltage73,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"You may be right, and even if I am able not to take seriously people who behave like that, still says a lot about the game. Plus you can't ask everyone to that gets flames to ""laugh it off"" because there shouldn't be flame in the first place.   Plus, I really dont get why you say there aren't many smurfs, I have been matched only with smurfs and met only one or maybe two guys who were actually new at the game.   As I said I play league of legends and even if everyone likes to  say that the league community is extremely toxic it's nothing like that and such things never happen.   I know that I underperform myself because as I said I am new and I am capable and willing to improve but you don't improve if your lane partner decides to go ""afk farming"" because ""wtf is this empath for real? fucking noob retarded cancer go die i go in jungle""  Seriously, for a game that is so little in community I would exepct more, this kind of things simply scare new players which brings the game to die. Even if you are the biggest game in thailand, thailand alone doesn't make you compete with other mobas tho."
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,HighVoltage73,2,Fri Jul 3 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"Everything you said is basically true, but thems the breaks.  I don't see it changing basically ever.  But the people your playing with aren't smurfs, they're just not new.  Brand new players really don't belong at 1500 at all, that's why you're suffering.  It does make it a lot better for people making new accounts that aren't new though."

HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,HighVoltage73,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:03:06 2015 UTC,You can report players for verbal abuse if that makes you feel better. When players do that to me I either just keep playing (if I think the player is competent) or I just leave the lane to roam. I mean I can't know what they're thinking in lane and if they don't communicate and just expect me to know their every move I can't help it.
HeroesofNewerth,3c0znx,HighVoltage73,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:47:17 2015 UTC,"Meet an asshole in game.  Right click their hero portrait, 'Mute Player'  ?????  PROFIT   If you 'Mute' them by right clicking, it will add them to your ignore list.  Anyone in your ignore list can never communicate with you by either text/voice.  You could instead just voice mute people for the current game you're in by clicking the ellipses (...) by their hero portrait, it should turn red.  This blocks their voice communication for the current game, toggle-able.  You can also use this command in chat:  /ignore add playername  edit: also, /ignore remove playername"

But it all comes within the competitive nature of any game you can see this in sports as well generally the best thing you can do is just try your best and be a motivation for your teammates. This game is worth it, the heroes and general game mechanics are much more unique then you'd see in Dota 2 along with a giant hero pool. If you wish to make a little money while playing this game, it's probably not going to happen. Unless you become a good streamer, I think by far our best streamer right now is inthe6 personality and game play. If you want to see how the community really is check out his stream  twitch.tv/inthe6 i'm going to tell you now, that it's going to take allot of time to master this game.

HeroesofNewerth,3bylrq,Imbaer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"Flint Beastwood is a squishy low mobility carry with high range spells and attacks that allows him to (attempt to) sit behind his teammates and deal large amounts of damage. You may find yourself focussed (as in enemies trying to kill you the most) if you pick him though because obviously it would be poor strategy to allow a flint to just hit you from long range.  If not flint, pyromancer is a relatively long/medium range spellcaster with huge loads of damage. You would have to get closer to enemies but at lvl 6 you have huge kill potential and the ulti feels very rewarding to slay enemies with!  Also newer hero calamity, he's a ganking carry with huge AOE (area of effect) spells that deal a lot of damage.  Problem with ranged distance hero is to compensate for that benefits theyre usually pretty easy to kill and positioning is key in hon but it's one of the harder things to learn/master/realize.  I'd say from your description you might have the most fun on calamity."

HeroesofNewerth,3bylrq,Ripoffs,7,Mon Jul 6 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"HoN as a whole is still very much alive, and you should never have an issue finding games.  There are still many viable strategies in the metagame, and although many people (and in most games) people try to pigeonhole into very specific roles, this is far from meaning these are the only ones available. From my understanding this is differen to LoL and perhaps DoTA. The game still has a huge amount of depth, including some untapped. I know that even at a time when I was in the top 1% of players by skill ranking, in a one-on-one scenario with a professional player (who also probably wasn't playing at their best) I would still get utterly dominated.  The game, of course, suffers from some angry players, although I have also had many rewarding games with really friendly players. The smallness of the community certainly means that towards the top of the MMR foodchain there are a lot of ""famous"" personalities - I can't say if this is the same lower down. If you come into a game with a good attitude, it's often common that your team will mirror it."
HeroesofNewerth,3bylrq,Great_Ness,2,Fri Jul 3 10:52:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply and I always approach gaming with a critical, but positive attitude, by critical I mean self critical.

HeroesofNewerth,3bylrq,Great_Ness,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said, there is a skill gradient and there are always ways to improve. Sometimes this is individual, like playing better in lane. Sometimes this is team based, like keeping morale or changing up your lanes. Of course the game has stat tracking and replays so you can analyse past play, and there are people you can talk to about specific problems as well as there being many guides."

I've downloaded from here : https://www.heroesofnewerth.com/download/  and here: http://hon.garena.com/downloads/game-download  The second link is the only one that'd actually go through with the download, however I can access the game, but It wont let me play saying i need to launch from Garena Client."
