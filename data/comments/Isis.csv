This is the most evolved terrorist organization thus far, evolved from learning western forces' strategy and tactics over the last decade of war in that region. The coalition's current strategy of using air strikes is not enough to defeat ISIS. The organization has strong holds on many key strategic points, which can only be cleared out with boots on the ground. Local ISIS' opponents on the ground don't have the skill or weapons to make significant advance against them. The fear of aiding another local group that may end becomming another terrorist organisation after ISIS is preventing western countries from openly doing so. Just bombing the region out is not an option, because it is never a smart idea to just bomb a location (like Japan during WW), it becomes a waste land. But who are we kidding, the instability in that region is a good thing for western countries' advancement. ISIS maybe weakened eventually, but there will be other worse ones that pop out."

Isis,3dwmhd,bluedreams23,2,Mon Jul 20 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, maybe it is optimistic, but in a conventional war, the US would win 90% of the time."
Isis,3dwmhd,texasxcrazy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:35 2015 UTC,"90% of the time seems a little low to me. If the US deploys ground troops in full force, then victory seems almost inevitable. The question is more when they will win and how many lives sacrificed it will take, rather than if they will win. The only way I see the US not destroying them is if it goes the way of the Vietnam war, and public opinion forces the US to withdraw, which I found highly unlikely."
