NorthKoreaPics,3dkv0r,Stefan_Zhirkov,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:14:10 2015 UTC,"I have heard real horror stories about healthcare in North Korea. There are 2 or 3 modern hospitals in the country. The rest rely on mouldy old medicine, 1970s Soviet equipment, and patients paying for their treatment by poorly trained personnel. Often people resort to herbal remedies because conventional medicine is too expensive or simply unavailable.  https://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&num=13238   When the government distributes rations, hospitals are activated. The government even sends doctors to search for medicinal herbs in the mountains for forty days every spring and fall. The doctors used to gather forty different kinds of herbs, pound them in a mortar and turn into medicine, and hand them out to cold patients. But now, everyone is out in Jangmadang [marketplace] because there isn’t enough food. So who’s going to go to the mountains and gather herbs?  The only reason why a number of modern devices exist is because of wealthy foreigners who are curious about North Korea.  Doctors sometimes have to stick patients’ thighs with things like sharp needles while they treat them for conditions like appendicitis, because they lack anesthetics.   -Cho Su Ah, surgeon in both North and South Korea over his career.

Try referring to this and this?  2) After that it's just the same as any other language: learn as many words as you can. People say the grammar is hard but it's just an SOV format with syntax words inbetween (Subject - syntax - object - syntax - verb.)  3) The hardest thing IMO is the way you end sentences in Korean, since there are a bunch of different ways depending on context (declaration / question / rhetorical question / assumption / sarcastic comment / etc.) and honorifics (authoritative / polite / friendly etc.) but to begin with this should be fine."

So the victory of ""military first"" political system is what they are ""enjoying"" now after the Korean War.  Also, Manse is commonly regarded mostly the same as ""banzai"" is regarded in Japanese, which is ""Huzzah!""

NorthKoreaPics,3cx7fw,marshsmellow,6,Sat Jul 11 22:24:42 2015 UTC,Young Pioneer tours and Koryo tours are very reliable companies that work closely with their North Korean partners. I would recommend checking out their websites and see which tour best suits you. There are detailed itineraries which explain what you'll be doing. You'll need to confirm the tour you want to go on at least 40 days before you go as the DPRK visa takes about a month to process. You'll also need to get your Chinese visa sorted out (if you need one). Read into the Chinese visa though as you might not need one if you won't be staying in Beijing for more than 72 hours between international flights.

I think we could see street level events if someone brought that thing to this location.   Here's the camera in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfshAzV0FN4
NorthKoreaPics,3cx7fw,Soperos,5,Sun Jul 12 01:54:04 2015 UTC,Wow funnily enough it looks like a normal well developed city.

NorthKoreaPics,3cx7fw,Soperos,4,Sat Jul 11 22:50:46 2015 UTC,This is their capital Pyongyang and it isn't anywhere near any borders. I'd be interested to see this documentary though.

NorthKoreaPics,3cugn1,paradeoxy1,7,Sat Jul 11 08:48:41 2015 UTC,"When i was in Pyongyang there seemed to be a certain degree of sartorial freedom, especially among the more elite members of society (one shop was selling a full adidas tracksuit). I also saw a child wearing an England shirt and many others with t-shirts with slogans on them, presumably brought in from China."
NorthKoreaPics,3cu98r,Zaruka,5,Fri Jul 10 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"This photo was taken in Pyongsong, a city north of Pyongyang and not often visited by foreigners. Fashion is making it out of Pyongyang and into the other cities. I have seen other fashion sense in Hamhung and Wonsan as well."

NorthKoreaPics,3cpipa,bmadz,11,Tue Jul 14 16:56:51 2015 UTC,Fashion trends in the Kim Jong-un era have accelerated. Skirts are shorter (probably as a result of the short skirts of the Moranbong Band) and Chinese fashion has infected the streets.   Umbrellas in Pyongyang https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/15140399329/  Girls at the Metro Station https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/15290643846/
NorthKoreaPics,3cpipa,Dr_Insomnia,11,Thu Jul 9 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Fashion is not really an applicable term in North Korea, as the Apparel Research Centre under the Clothing Industry Department of the National Light Industry Committee designs most clothing. However, things have loosened up somewhat, with bright colours now permitted as being in accordance with a ""socialist lifestyle"". Pyongyang offers some access to foreign styles. A Japanese watch denotes someone in an influential position; a foreign luxury watch indicates a very senior position. The increasing appearance of Adidas, Disney and other brands (usually fake) indicates that access to goods smuggled from China is growing. Jeans have at times been fashionable, though risky – occasionally they have been banned as ""decadent"", along with long hair on men, which can lead to arrest    The Guardian  Keep in mind this is a very limited group, perhaps the top 10% of North Koreans; women make up as much as 80% of the rural workforce. Those who live in Pyongyang are well-connected and very wealthy compared to the rest of the country, and have access to many many more things the rest don't"
NorthKoreaPics,3cpipa,conquer69,2,Fri Jul 10 16:33:30 2015 UTC,What happens to the men? are the majority enlisted in the military?
NorthKoreaPics,3cpipa,Demotic,2,Sun Jul 12 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"Correct - in Pyongyang. Some in Hoeryong benefit by cross-border trade. There seems to be pockets of prosperity in Chongjin and Pyongsong. Access to goods, hard currency and connections are how the society functions."

North Koreans are an  oppressed people, it's like saying ""Oh you visited rural Kenya recently? I bet all those starving women had great bodies!"""

I'm not even talking about sex, but sure, for the sake of the argument let's lump the two together.   You're saying that an ancient, primal, visceral emotion doesn't exist because of context?   That's ridiculous."

NorthKoreaPics,3cpipa,Soperos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:17 2015 UTC,The tours are a bit more free than you think. I think there is a bit of a change there. The locals are no longer shying away. Women will now come up to you and converse and I mean at random. I was taken by surprise. That is not the way it used to be.
NorthKoreaPics,3copqa,Zaruka,3,Thu Jul 9 15:32:09 2015 UTC,Women in the rural countryside with their bicycles seem to be the most common traffic seen on the dirt roads.

NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,glitterlok,30,Wed Jul 8 05:37:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is the last photo from my trip! It was included in the original gallery that I posted, but I really wanted to put it up by itself.  I’ve had a great time posting my few crappy pictures and sharing my experiences in the DPRK, such as they were. I know I’ve had some disagreements with some folks, and I was honestly discouraged by some of the responses that my photos received - messages full of paranoia and suspicion and a reluctance to accept anything other than the very narrow narrative that people tend to hear about the DPRK. It wasn’t what I expected to find in a sub specifically dedicated to pictures of the country, but that's okay!  It's also why I really wanted to post this picture on its own. This picture, to me at least, is the DPRK.  It’s a beautiful little girl with a smile covered in the chocolate bar that I had given her. It’s the way she giggled when I used the most formal and respectful version of “Hello” in Korean to greet her.  It’s the patient grandmother who was trailing the little one through the park and trying to keep her tiny May Day joseon-ot (DPRK equivalent of hanbok) clean, and who struggled to recall the words “Thank you” in English.  It’s the group of Koreans doing karaoke in the background. It’s the one fellow down the hill who had a HORRIBLE voice and drew a crowd of roaring spectators with his enthusiastic singing. It’s the people running relay races in the fields - I think I also saw some hatchet throwing. It’s the sounds of hysterical laughter and the smell of grilling meat.  It’s how quickly Korean people were to break into a smile, no matter where you were in the country. A simple head nod or even a moment of eye contact with a stranger passing by - workers, soldiers, children, old people, farmers, anyone - would more often than not take their faces from cautious curiosity to full-on high-beam smiles in an instant.  It’s the pride the people take in themselves, their people, their country, and their achievements, many of which have been made despite horrible conditions created by the government’s policies and the DPRK’s isolated place in the modern world.  People may disagree with me about the merits of travel to the DPRK. People may doubt my experiences in the country. People may choose to focus on the news stories and distill the DPRK down into a simple shit-hole with no redeeming qualities.  But I think we can all agree that the Korean people deserve better, and not because they are special. They deserve better because all people deserve the opportunity to live free lives. And part of what I think they deserve is to be remembered and considered by the rest of the world.  Every time I hear a news story about the DPRK, I think about this beautiful little girl. I think about her grandmother. I think about my amazing Korean guides - one of whom I posted about a few weeks ago. I think about all of the people I spoke with, shared food with, sang songs with, played games with, or even brushed by on the street. It’s changed the way I hear those stories completely, and I hope that just maybe seeing these pictures and hearing these stories will lead some other people to think differently about the DPRK as well.  Thanks and 안녕하십니까!"
NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,makosira,22,Wed Jul 8 05:37:47 2015 UTC,"This is basically what I subscribed to this subreddit for in the first place. Yes, there are terrible things that happen in North Korea, but there are plenty of other things about North Korea that should also be seen. Like this little girl and her grandmother, or any of the other people you mentioned. They all have lives. They might not be the greatest lives because of where they happen to live, but you pretty much summed everything up in your description here.  I, however, don't browse this subreddit much because since I've subscribed, I've noticed a tendency for people to make North Korea jokes in the comments among other things, which when I was directed to this sub from another comment a while back, I was expressly told those were frowned upon here.  So I guess, basically, I'm just thanking you for making this post and also taking the time to write this out. It's nice to get perspectives about civilian life in North Korea that isn't all grim or focusing on how hard they have it (because they do have it pretty bad), but there ARE other things to focus on."

NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,c_cta,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:40:25 2015 UTC,"I've never been to NK.  (Would love to go, but not a fan of tour-bus style travelling, so that might ruin it for me.)  But my experience with living in China is that it is nothing like how people in other countries think it is...despite the fact that it is an open country that anyone can visit and explore.  So, that's why I am reluctant to accept the way that North Korea is described by people who haven't spent some time there.  When I see all these pictures of North Korea, it honestly looks the same as rural China to me."
NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,throwaway_thyroid,2,Wed Jul 8 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"The more I travel, the more I realized how quickly the caricatures that we create for different parts of the world fall apart once you're actually there.  I would love to see more of China! I've only had the pleasure of being in Beijing for a few days, but it certainly made me curious to see more.  As for the bus-style traveling, I'm with you. This was the first tour that I've been on, and as a typical solo traveler I was quite concerned about it. Luckily I was with a fairly small group of decent people - no one who was going to push themselves on me if I wanted to spend some time by myself. I think the kind of people that the DPRK attracts are probably not your typical tourist, so that helps.  The group I booked through (Koryo) also offers private tours, if you're interested. You'll still have two Korean guides while you're in the country, but you won't have to worry about a bunch of other folks."
NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,Traumaturge,2,Wed Jul 8 23:55:56 2015 UTC,This is what I wanna to hear more from people who have been to North Korea. I feel like everyone has had such a bad image about NK that they refused to accept any other information or the other side of the story. Thanks for this :).

NorthKoreaPics,3cipmu,samirbrokeit,5,Thu Jul 9 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"No truth to that whatsoever as far as I experienced. I've never heard of such a thing and there was plenty of eye contact to be had both inside and outside of Pyongyang.  I think the importance of or interest in tourists is one of the bigger misconceptions people might have. I didn't get the impression that anyone gave a shit that I was there apart from the two Korean guides who were responsible for showing me around. There were some curious looks from children or older people occasionally. Some folks went out of their way to accommodate me, presumably because I was a foreigner.  But for the most part I was treated like a tourist in any other part of the world - largely ignored. I certainly never got the impression that there were any rules about engaging with or avoiding me. People were just going about their lives, oblivious or uncaring about my presence for the most part."

NorthKoreaPics,3cfit7,chanigan,2,Tue Jul 7 20:50:52 2015 UTC,I have taken over 28k photos over 6 trips to North Korea. The guides will generally let you photograph but there are places and times when you can't. Military and misery are generally forbidden. I tend to like people and small towns. I have been all over the country and will go back next year. They know that I take photos of life in the country but some of my photos have been deleted. That is true of most photographers. I am not a professional photographer but I am someone that travels to the more difficult places.
NorthKoreaPics,3cfit7,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Wed Jul 8 01:57:06 2015 UTC,"As someone who's been to NK a lot, what's your overall impression of the country? All the ""happy"" pictures of North Korea makes it look like a very pleasant place to live as long as you're not at the bottom of society, but I'd imagine there are quite a lot of restrictions even for the middle class.  Speaking of which, how does ""class"" work in NK? What determines if you're going to be miserable or well of in life?"
NorthKoreaPics,3cfit7,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"Well I would not say it is so happy. My NK friends say they are worried about the future. This is always a concern of everyone. The 30% on the bottom are in poverty and social mobility through marriage or opportunity is limited. I like to ask the middle school children what their parents do for work and you can tell that they come from the middle of the society.  Class is divided into the trusted class of reliables, the indifferent mass and the hostile class. I think we are seeing some erosion of this but it is slow."

NorthKoreaPics,3cfonv,geographies,5,Tue Jul 7 15:34:48 2015 UTC,I have heard pretty poor reviews of the food in North Korea. While that looks like a large serving it doesn't appear very appetizing/flavorful.

The food you get for lunch and dinner is generally speaking, quite good. You eat all kinds of meat barbecues, hot pots and traditional Korean dishes. There's always plenty of beer too and it's really cheap. The most I ever payed for a beer out there was 2 euros and that was at some upper class bar."

NorthKoreaPics,3cfonv,Zaruka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"eh the 'average' North Korean gets 2,103 calories a day. But like 70 percent of that is from a single grain and very little 'meat.' I would assume that for a large portion of the rural poor 90+ percent is from a single grain and well under the caloric average."
NorthKoreaPics,3cfonv,Zaruka,2,Tue Jul 7 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"There's no way that number didn't come from government propaganda because there's so little NGO participation in the DPRK that there's no other source of that information. I highly doubt that number is accurate, this is a country that has had mass starvation intermittently for two decades."
NorthKoreaPics,3cfonv,Zerychon,4,Tue Jul 7 20:41:57 2015 UTC,Its from UN data. Its smoothing things out and not looking at things like the 1990s famine. Certainly people are dying but the 'average' person is having more trouble with malnutrition than starvation. We also do not know what the standard deviations or skew is. The UN recommends 2500 calories a day anyways and if you are involved in hard labor and are getting less than 2100 that is a problem.

NorthKoreaPics,3bx1gt,TommBomBadil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:49:05 2015 UTC,Every time I think about north Korea I wonder what makes the dictatorship go on? What makes it so difficult to overturn? All the infos that comes from there are either catastrophic for the population or completely absurd towards the regime.
NorthKoreaPics,3bx1gt,effifox,6,Thu Jul 2 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, the DPRK is built on some pre-existing elements that it has used to its benefit. Korea is a small, ethnically homogenous country that has been invaded often by its neighbours. The DPRK has based its legitimacy on fighting the Japanese in WWII (which isn't 100% accurate) and on creating myths of American occupation in the South (which is extremely innacurate). The use of fear of outsiders has set up a strong base there. This is compounded by a very strong racial element - there is a deep idea in the DPRK that the Korean people are the ""purest"" and ""most innocent"" people - so you're going on a racial purity aspect. You then add in Confucian-based ideas of the Kims as a ""protective fatherly figure"", protecting the innocent people of the DPRK from all the horrors of the outside world. Combine this with ""Juche"", generally translated as ""self-reliance"" and a total control of the population that's almost exactly like the book 1984. Remember, the population is almost 100% closed off from the outside world, and essentially having a ""thoughtcrime"" can get you sent to a concentration camp. People eventually police their own thoughts to stay safe.  In addition, no other country wants to deal with the effects of destabilizing the region. If the DPRK collapses, there will be millions of starving, brainwashed, unskilled refugees pouring into South Korea and China. Reunification with the South is difficult since the South is so advanced - the Reunificiation of Germany caused the German economy to stumble, and the East Germans had food and viable educations. The differences between North and South Korea are now so vast it would deeply hurt the South to unify - even their two dialects of Korean are now growing different enough that it is hard to understand each other. The US and Japan, and well as South Korea and China, also don't want to deal with the possibility of violence of a failed state right in the heart of East Asia, as well as any potential issues with unsecured nukes."
NorthKoreaPics,3bx1gt,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Thu Jul 2 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"Add to that that officers and officials can embezzle public money and live decadently, so they have little interest in endangering themselves by overthrowing the current, satisfactory order."

A full coup is unlikely since so much is based on the Kims' personality cult, and any real change would lead to destabilization unless it was the same level of control."

When Kim Jong Un came in a few years ago he executed hundreds of senior people who might have exploited his weakness as the new leader to sideline or assassinate him.   Everyone now is deathly afraid of him, and he is still hyper-vigilant of anything that looks like it might threaten his regime.  I think it will take many years before a coupe will be able to gain steam and succeed."

NorthKoreaPics,3bsz08,avalanchethethird,44,Wed Jul 1 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"This is just the camera girl with a marijuana leaf, not entirely sure where she got it from but it's not hard to get your hands on.  Cannabis in the DPRK is legal and grows naturally, with male and female plants growing side by side. This means that the seeds can not feminise; the plants do not produce enough THC to have any effect.  Instead of being known for any recreational value, it is used as a cheaper alternative to rolling tobacco."
NorthKoreaPics,3bsz08,ch_ex,30,Wed Jul 1 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"marijuana with no seeds is a relatively recent phenomenon, introduced by the later hippies as 'sensimilla'. The THC content is related to governed more by genetics rather than growing conditions, and the reason why pot is seedless as a standard these days has to do with it being monetarily dense enough to be a connoisseur crop.  Wild strains of cannabis grow all over the world and generally have a low thc content because they're self-selecting for survival rather than the THC content that has been used as a focus for artificial breeding for a long time.  Relatively high quality pot with seeds, grown in the same way, can still be found in the hindu 'kush' (yup, that kush) mountains and parts of afghanistan. If seeds affected the quality of the weed to a huge extent, it would be very hard to breed for quality. Pot is grown seedless for mostly practical reasons, though it does lend to more dense and uniform product.  edit: I guess I should add that I'm a weed scientist in the public sector. Most of my focus is in drafting standards of practice, so there are many much more qualified amateur breeders in r/trees to address this sort of thing for those interested. Very neat to see people doing real science with minimal equipment. I also don't enjoy weed on any level, so again, I'd defer to the real experts on the relevant sub.  I made this post to address a specific misunderstanding and tried to make it simple. Reading it back, I oversimplified it to the point where it's not really correct and people have been pointing out the inaccuracy enough that I feel the need to change it. Genetics define the potential of a specific strain, while growing conditions and methods (sensimilla; bastardized loan word from spanish) determine to what extent that potential is realized. Thanks for the additions and corrections."

It does contain more THC (and cannabinoids in general) without seeds because energy that goes into producing THC is instead used to develop seeds. This doesn't mean no THC as other posters have said, but a very low THC content."
NorthKoreaPics,3bsz08,ch_ex,7,Thu Jul 2 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"yup - there's even THC in commercial hemp, just a minute amount. It's an incredible plant; amazing growth kinetics and phenotypic flexibility. Just a powerhouse. very rewarding to work with."

NorthKoreaPics,3bsz08,ch_ex,2,Sun Jul 5 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"is this a euphemism? if so, /r/trees would provide much better advice for things like this. My job is more about ensuring that pot grown for the medical market meets exceptionally high standards, and my interest in the plant itself is outside of my professional responsibilities.   That said, speaking generally, pot has been bred for pretty much every conceivable trait (including auto-flowering which is pretty cool). With most seeds available being feminized, you dont even have to worry about sorting out the males anymore.   Seeds are also expensive (for seeds) because even if they're a half-assed strain, they almost certainly have an impressive pedigree and will produce relatively good pot in relatively high yield.   Once you've decided what you're looking for, any strain you choose with those characteristics will be pretty good simply because there's so much money in the industry that there's no room for crappy genetics.  I wish it weren't illegal cause it's an amazing plant for budding (sorry) horticulturalists; it responds almost instantly to favorable conditions and grows... well, like a weed, so you don't need to have a green thumb to grow it successfully."

I don't know the first thing about dandelion cultivars, though I suspect that because there is so little demand for it commercially, that any seeds that come in a pack are just wild dandelions.   Because they're such a ubiquitous species (lots of pollen, excellent seed dispersal), isolating stand-out genes would be exceptionally difficult due to contamination from nearby wild dandelions, as well as difficult to control cross pollination in your breeding population.   'Marihuana' is a particularly easy plant to manipulate because it doesn't grow male and female flowers on the same plant (as a rule, hermies happen), and there usually aren't wild specimens nearby to fertilize female flowers with inferior genes. This allows for complete control over pollination with minimal equipment and effort; something that is incredibly difficult with plants that can self-pollinate and have native varieties that contaminate your efforts."

There's a massive divide between the privileged that live in Pyongyang and those who don't.  Inside Pyongyang they live fairly well off, they have access to enough food and water and they commute to work and do the things that most people across the world do, of course without access to free media.

Also, due to its close proximity with Seoul, the dialect they speak there is very similar to the Seoul dialect. It's the little green part of North Korea"

NorthKoreaPics,3b7hnw,narthon,7,Sun Jun 28 20:31:27 2015 UTC,We do have the pledge of allegiance but they don't bow. Nobody in the USA ever bows pretty much under any circumstance unless they do so in the context of religion (though I don't think there is any sect of Christianity where this is common...?

NorthKoreaPics,3b7hnw,CaptainLovely,6,Wed Jul 1 04:49:48 2015 UTC,I'd say probably <10 people in the USA have met the emperor of japan. <200 (???) have met the queen. So excepting these rare shows of respect my statement still stands. Bowing is a rare thing and not something most people have exposure too.  Certainly they don't bow to the flag in school. They don't bow to our political leaders. They don't bow to statues of dead leaders.  Bowing to a powerless figurehead like the queen or the emperor for historical reasons is a little different.
NorthKoreaPics,3b7hnw,maora34,-2,Wed Jul 1 05:24:40 2015 UTC,"Saluting the flag, standing for the national anthem. All these things are comparable to bowing to a statue."
NorthKoreaPics,3b7hnw,CaptainLovely,7,Wed Jul 1 05:30:55 2015 UTC,"Bowing to a statue is paying respects to a person.

I wonder what these people think, putting on a show they know to be false, only to go back to their lives of depravity as soon as the tourists leave. Scary place to live, I think many of these North Koreans live their lives in constant fear. Something has to change over there, I hope for the day the reigeme collapses. Hopefully a better government can be put in place and the Koreas can be united at last."
NorthKoreaPics,3b2sjv,screwballsmith,9,Fri Jun 26 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"I have been in the DPRK a total of 52 days now. Do you think any totalitarian society (and I have been in many) is able to pull off deception to any degree? Sorry. The DPRK is clumsy at everything. The number of times we have seen what we are not supposed to see is daily. They cannot pull it off. Besides, what do you think happens when the bus breaks down (frequently if not daily) and you arrive late or early you see things. The myth of the fake fruit - funny because the society cannot produce fake fruit. There is no petrochemical industry. Anything plastic is imported from China. They do not waste their time on plastic fruit or stores filled with fake stuff. Are things not for sale? Sometimes yes but I saw the same in the USSR, Bulgaria, Romania, Cuba so it is not isolated.  Deprivation when we leave? No. They live in deprivation when we are there.   Most tourists take a 5-7 day tour and see nothing. If you go longer and go to the countryside you see North Korea. Everything is done by hand. Harvest is when you should go as people are hand picking corn, beans and fruit.   https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/15156643070/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/15305271381/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/15308062512/ https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/6167725626/  There are things I have seen that I was unable to photograph. The Kotjebi or homeless children are seen in the provincial cities. I have seen them. I have been in food distribution areas and markets. The primitive nature of the economy is evident. They are recycling nails.  Oh I have been to some bad areas. I was in one rural hotel unexpectedly. We had to be rerouted and stayed in a forbidden town. The blaring speakers with constant propaganda was terrible.    Consider a few facts. Ice cream is now more widespread. In the last two years we are seeing more ice cream being sold after school by women at the middle schools and I mean the rural middle schools. There is money (I have been up to the private marketers and they have Chinese currency, NK Won and sometimes US dollars) and the students have enough to buy it.   By the way when the guides get nervous we know we are not supposed to see something. They cannot keep up appearances. They are terrible at totalitarianism.   Regimented kids? These are the robots at the Mass Games but if you arrive early they are not so regimented.   https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/4272364862/  All is not what you think. I recommend going there."
NorthKoreaPics,3b2sjv,TreyWait,0,Sun Jun 28 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting, well I always like to hear from people that have actually been to the country. As I said I'm no expert, but I do find the country fascinating.   I think those christian churches are fake though, correct me if I'm wrong. I've heard that christianity is banned in the country and if you are a christian you can get in serious trouble. I saw a documentary where they asked about that and the guide said that was a myth, then they went to one of these churches.   I'd definitely like to visit North Korea one day, if I get the resources and courage. I think I'd really worry about being one of those few who are detained by the authorities over there for some reason or another."
NorthKoreaPics,3b2sjv,SomeHickFromMissouri,3,Mon Jun 29 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"Let's talk churches. It was one of my goals to visit one and last year I did. You can see that here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/sets/72157647954217562  The Chilgol church is the church that Kim Il-sung's mother attended in Pyongyang. She was a Christian and Kim Il-sung went to a Christian school for a short time. Billy Graham preached in North Korea, Franklin Graham travels there today. Franklin's mother  lived in North Korea for a time.   The church you see here is in a part of Pyongyang that was historically Christian. It was destroyed and rebuilt. This is not the only church in Pyongyang. I have a photo of the Catholic Church as seen from a distance.   Is it real or a sham? I think the answer is yes, a bit of both. I have been to services in most every socialist country. China is clearly a sham but the worshipers are not all phony. In the USSR the babushkas were there. In the DPRK most of the congregation were older women - politically considered outside of interest. They seemed to know the songs but the minister - well I know he is a trusted party member. Why mention Kim Jong-un during the service?   One thing stuck out to me. The guides and party members would not set foot in the place then asked us about what we saw inside. If it is a sham then why not go in? I did meet a man from Chicago in the church. He was born in Pyongyang and comes back for visits.   It is not entirely a sham but they exist on subsidies from South Korean and American donations. I also see that weddings and baptisms are not taking place. I think the services are regular and not entirely for foreigners. It is part sham but I think those older women have some link to Christianity either directly or related to a Christian. Controlled? Nothing in North Korea is not directly controlled by the state.   Christians are operating in the North to some degree. I have seen Christian groups doing humanitarian work but not proselytizing. That is strictly forbidden.   Buddhism is there and I have even seen South Korean monks traveling to monasteries. The Buddhist monks I have met know the religion well. Here is a photo set of one temple: https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaruka/sets/72157622488882270  Christianity is controlled but I would not say banned. It was destroyed years ago but rebuilt by outside agencies and certainly used by the regime.   I do suggest you go but I would not do anything except listen and observe."

I have thousands of photos on Flickr and after six visits I can say that I have been fortunate enough to be in the countryside and in the fields. We see the reality of life in the villages and it is a hard existence that is far from Pyongyang.
NorthKoreaPics,3azuat,BorckLesnawr,4,Wed Jun 24 20:56:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the pics. North Korea looks very interesting. How's the night-life there? Does everything close early? Any curfews?

NorthKoreaPics,3azuat,boomer456,3,Fri Jul 3 15:43:00 2015 UTC,By going on tours. I go on tours that are specialty tours to remote locations in the country. I prefer rural areas during harvest.   I travel to Beijing and fly in with a tour.   To understand the DPRK you have to go to multiple places and over time. Things change - glacially slow but they do change. Is there more or less private enterprise? How is the food situation - not at your hotel but on the street and in the rural areas? How are people reacting to foreigners? That has changed over time. What are they showing you? How much freedom do they give you to photograph as opposed to the old days?   There is much to see and learn. I go to listen and learn.

I go back to see change over time. The country is changing slowly and you can see the differences. Also to really ""see"" the country you have to go and spend time there. Your first visit is too much to take in. You have to get used to the society and observe. What are you seeing? Is what you see political or cultural? This is Korea. The societal rules are different.  I recommend that people go to rural China first for comparison. See how people live in Jilin for example. See the Korean community in China for comparison."
NorthKoreaPics,3awmz5,glitterlok,43,Wed Jun 24 02:29:02 2015 UTC,"This is Miss Chang.  Miss Chang (she's single!) works for KITC, the Korean International Travel Company. She was one of two guides that accompanied me during my trip to the DPRK.  When you hear people make jokes about ""government minders"" when speaking about travel to the DPRK, this is who they're talking about.  My guides were both incredibly helpful. Their English was fantastic, and their knowledge of the DPRK vast. They were always happy to answer my questions, even the dumb ones. They took very good care of me.  Miss Chang had a wonderful voice, and would occasionally sing in the bus. Her rendition of ""Arirang"" put a lump in my throat...multiple times! I tried to get her to sing karaoke one night, but she was a little too shy for that. :-P   She was very proud of her country and the accomplishments and determination of her people. She was also very forthcoming about some of the struggles they face, including poverty and difficulties with crop growth.  Her knowledge of the outside world was surprisingly deep. She would often make accurate comparisons of Korean culture to other cultures. She studied tourism at university, which may have had something to do with it.  She joked with me about moving to the DPRK and becoming a tour guide. She told me my dog was ugly when I showed her pictures on my phone. She giggled for half an hour after learning a joke about calling 2:30 ""dentist time."" She would sometimes use the front-facing camera on her phone to check her hair when she didn't think anyone was watching. Her face lit up whenever she was around children.  Near the end of my trip, I asked her where in the world she would most like to travel. She said, ""I don't know because I've never really considered it."" It broke my heart.  Miss Chang represented her country well. It was a pleasure to meet her, and I hope that one day she'll get the opportunity to put pins in a map."

NorthKoreaPics,3awmz5,justdweezil,11,Wed Jun 24 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"I was also curious about her life, but it sounds like she works almost non-stop. The day I left, she was headed to the airport to pick up another tourist for a two-week visit.  She mentioned that during the ebola crisis (the DPRK stopped all tourism for a few weeks,) she was able to get some much needed sleep and spent some time at a ski resort (Masikryong.) That's the only time I heard about any free time activities.  As for where she lives, her family (mother, father, brother) lives near Pyongyang. Women in the DPRK typically live with their parents until they are married. Then they either move in with their husband's family (male children are expected to care for their parents as they age) or get their own place (if the government gives them one.)  It's not difficult to visit at all! I just signed up for a trip with Koryo Tours, based in Beijing. Simple as that. :-)"

NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,DonationBox,3,Wed Jul 15 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"Well...it depends what you mean by ""freely."" :-P  I'll start with the part that certain critical folks love focusing on - the tour aspect. For the average tourist to the DPRK, the only way to visit is on a guided tour. You can go with a small group on a planned itinerary or by yourself on a custom itinerary, but either way you're accompanied by two Korean tour guides.  This is the part where people like to shout ""You mean government minders!"" and I respond with ""...eh?"" My two guides were tour guides. That was the role they played and they were just like any tour guides you'd meet anywhere. They shared interesting information, answered questions, made terrific conversation during downtime, drank, made jokes, had fun, sang songs, etc. I posted a photo / wrote about one of my guides here. They took great care of me and at no time did they feel like anything more than professional tour guides. YMMV, I suppose.  The tour itself was exactly what you would expect in that I got to see the highlights of the country in a relatively short amount of time. Historic sites, cultural landmarks, naturally beautiful areas - it was all very typical tour stuff. What people are sometimes surprised to hear is that it was not a white-washed tour. I saw several areas with a lot of poverty and some run down towns with run down people living in them. At no time were any excuses made for this, nor were there attempts made to distract me or prevent me from seeing it.  I did not see death camps or nukes - shocker, right? I've been told that means that I was being lied to and that my entire experience was false or staged. But I don't know many tours that take you to death camps or nuclear facilities!  Other than that, there was a lot more freedom to move around than I would have thought previous to going there. I walked down some Pyongyang streets alone, wandered around a huge park full of Koreans outside of the city away from the group, ducked into some shops and stores by myself, etc. My tour guides seemed totally fine with this and no one else seemed surprised about me doing my own thing. Granted, none of these little solo excursions lasted very long - the tour kept me moving from one place to another - but there was also nothing tense or unusual about them either. I just...did my thing.  In fact, even writing this answer feels a little weird, because I'm defining edges to something that didn't feel like it had edges when I was experiencing it. No one was saying ""Be within our sight at all times"" or ""Stay within these borders"" or anything like that because...it just wasn't an issue. It wasn't something that was brought up at all. The only exception to that was that I was asked not to leave the hotel grounds by myself at night.  I did not try to push any boundaries. I didn't try to walk through any closed doors or sneak away or trespass on any property...but why would I? I wouldn't do those things in any country that I visit.  Sooooo, long story short...there are constraints. I wasn't able to do my typical travel move of showing up with no plan and no agenda and wandering around figuring stuff out. But within those constraints, I felt perfectly comfortable. And I feel like if the same situation happened in any other country, no one would question it or bat an eye.  I know I sound defensive. Sorry about that. I've just gotten a lot of flack in these threads. ;-)  Here's an AMA I did about the trip: https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/374bwg/i_recently_traveled_to_the_dprk_north_korea/"

Well I say people are being too negative about something they have zero experience with.  Take this picture for example. It's of a square used mainly for parades and large events, and it was taken in the middle of a work day. You can clearly see several people walking by and many more hanging out in the shadows of the buildings. Just off to the left there's a coffee shop that I went to a few times that makes a mean mocha. A few hours after this photo was taken, the entire square was full of Koreans laughing and practicing for a mass dance that took place the following evening.  Was the city empty? No. It wasn't as crowded as say, NYC, but there were plenty of people walking around. In early morning and mid-afternoon, the sidewalks were packed with kids going to school in their uniforms and people dressed smartly and headed to work.  There were cars on the road. Again, not as many as most places I've been, but enough to cause traffic jams more than a handful of times while I was there. There were crowded public busses, a bustling (albeit small) subway system, etc. Many of the autos were quite old, but just as many were quite modern (see the photo.)  There were construction sites - huge apartment buildings going up very near to Kim Il-Sung square. There were military drills happening down by the river. There was a marching band practicing on the other side of the river. There were kids on field trips running around outside of Juche tower.  Were their plates empty? No. Especially not in Pyongyang - and yes, I know it's different there. There were restaurants, bars, coffee shops, street food vendors, convenience stores, etc. I had some killer tuna kimbap at one of the little stands that rivaled any I'd ever had in Seoul. I also ate at restaurants in a few other towns, and visited a park an hour or so outside of Pyongyang where families were having barbecue picnics, singing karaoke, playing volleyball and running relay races.  But your comment is ""city is emptier than their plates.""  Now look... I understand your comment is kinda a joke, so I'm sorry you of all people are getting this whole rant. Forgive me. You don't deserve it. It's just kinda coming out...  I'm not saying all of this because I think the DPRK is some wonderful place. I cried when I left because it is a tragedy that the beautiful people that I met there have to live in such a shitty place run by such a shitty regime. There is so much going on there that is wrong. And that's all we ever hear about!  But there is so much there that is...normal. None of the things I just described are great. I'm not singing any praises. I'm not saying the DPRK is a paradise because it has coffee shops. That would be stupid.  What I'm trying to do is share with people - maybe people like you - that what we hear on the news is only a fraction of what the DPRK is. That there is normal life that happens there. That there are smiling, happy people with families who they love very much. That there are modern conveniences. That there is awareness of the outside world, however stunted. That teenage girls were taking group selfies in their pink princess backpacks.  And most of all - and this is where I will sing some praises - that it is a country full of beautiful, intelligent, hard-working, generous people who have been overshadowed by and largely ignored because of their bombastic government, and they deserve better than that.  I think more people need to see the other side of the DPRK. There is so much ignorance about the DPRK, and all the negative comments from people who seem so resistant to anything positive or even neutral happening there are proof to me that there's a whole lot of the story missing.  So, I'm sorry once again for this ridiculous rant. I'm just tired of every comment being some barbed statement based on nothing but preconceptions and memes. People may think I'm biased, but I think it takes a lot more bias to claim to know something about a place without having ever been there. That's all! I'm done.  Hope you have a great evening!"
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,Duke0fWellington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"Not to be biased, but as a Chinese person, Tiananmen square is also primarily for parades and shit and even in the worst of weather there are lots of people walking across it all the time. Of course that is Beijing but I doubt Pyongyang's population density is so low when compared to its construction."
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,yetiman223,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:12:32 2015 UTC,"That's not biased, it's the truth! I was in Tiananmen a week before I took this photo. It was packed!  Pyongyang's population density is around 2/3 that of Beijing. China also has hundreds of millions of tourists per year, whereas the DPRK only has a handful at any given time.  Definitely more people out and about on the streets at any given time in Beijing, though. No bias needed!"
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,Duke0fWellington,0,Thu Jun 25 08:58:02 2015 UTC,"That's one benefit of a planned economy, wide open spaces and beautiful buildings in the middle of city centres."
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,yetiman223,6,Sun Jun 21 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Everything on this picture somehow looks depressing. Gray buildings, almost no people around and cheap looking propaganda billboards."
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,Duke0fWellington,3,Mon Jun 22 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about what you mean by planned economy. I only ask because I live in the US, which has a very different economy than the DPRK, and a lot of our cities have wide open spaces in the middle of them. I've also found that to be true in other countries that I wouldn't put in the same category as the DPRK. Not arguing your point! Just curious about it. :-)"
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,yetiman223,2,Sun Jun 21 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"What, wide open spaces like in this picture? In places like NY and LA? I'm not talking about parks here, but just wide open spaces of nothing like in this Picture. In non planned economies, where the government isn't running the economy, wide open spaces of nothing in city centres is way too valuable to leave as nothing. A piece of open land like in this picture in the middle of London would be worth millions."
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,Duke0fWellington,5,Sun Jun 21 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"Well, comparing apples to apples, I live near DC and there are plenty of big open spaces like this there.  I'm not sure how parks don't count, but there are open spaces in NY as well - Times Square comes to mind. It's not this large, but it's pretty big! Especially if you've seen it when the crowds are low. I spent some time in Norway earlier this year and there were lots of open spaces, even in smaller cities like Bergen. India is full of gigantic spaces like this. There are several large open areas / squares in Seoul. London has Trafalgar. The Vatican has St Peter's. Piazza San Marco in Venice. Place de la Concorde in Paris.  All of them exist in countries where the government doesn't control the economy (well, the vatican might be an exception there.) Am I missing something?"
NorthKoreaPics,3akfyz,yetiman223,2,Mon Jun 22 03:33:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I can't imagine what a large open piece of land in the middle of a western city would look like

There were street lights in some areas, but even the road up to the tourist hotel was pretty dark once it got late. Areas with restaurants or stores were well lit.  From what I could tell, most of the high-rise buildings were apartment buildings.

While in service I was station in Russia for a couple of weeks for joined military exercises and even though we were in a very remote city in a middle of nowhere I saw at least half a dozen Lenin statues and a couple of monuments similar to the one on picture but smaller of course. Same with China, went there during vacation and you can find similar monuments there as well."
NorthKoreaPics,39o1fe,OldStarfighter,2,Mon Jun 22 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"The prevalence of elaborate monuments can convince citizens that their quality of life must be exceptionally high. Americans in the 1950s got refrigerators, Russians got bronze statues. Propaganda, simple as."

NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,Phexord,5,Sat Jun 20 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"I also visited some areas outside of Pyongyang, so it wasn't just one place!  I never felt unsafe. I mentioned a few times in my AMA that there's a lot more to the DPRK than the headlines we read, and things feel a lot different when they're right in front of you. I think this applies to all travel. No matter where I've gone - India, China, Iceland, Romania, Korea, Abu Dhabi, Belize, etc - once I'm on the ground, things ""solidify"" into reality and I think ""Oh! Right...this is earth. What the fuck was I expecting?"" The DPRK was no different.  I'm sure someone could get themselves into a lot of trouble there if they were looking for it. But I knew what lines shouldn't be crossed (mainly, don't disrespect the leaders) and I didn't feel any need to cross those lines.  It was also made clear to me that tourists are not expected to agree with or believe in the ideals of the regime. Juche is for Koreans, not foreigners. And so while I was expected to try to be respectful, it would be understandable if I slipped up or did something inadvertently.  So I never felt unsafe, even for a moment."

Let's be real here and address the illegal labor camps and mass murders"
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,EminGH,6,Mon Jun 22 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"Dude, you gotta calm down. This guy was just telling us as neutral as possible what he experienced. And it should be no surprise that you don't accidently step into a labor camp every few steps as tourist.  All that you do right now is being a general jerk by telling everyone OP is a liar 'cause he doesn't mix how he experienced the country up with political views. He doesn't say that these problems don't exist, but he limits what he says to what he saw. And that should be perfectly fine."
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,Phexord,-2,Mon Jun 22 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"You gotta calm down Glitterlok.. Here's the deflection I was referring to (See below).. Anytime someone brings up facts, he's/you are quick to rebuttal pointing fingers somewhere else   There was plenty of food available in Pyongyang.   I imagine there are starving people there, just as there are in every country - probably a lot more. There are hungry people in DC a few miles from where I live right now - probably some near you too.  None? Are you sure? There is starvation everywhere. In 2011, WHO put the death by malnutrition rate in the US at 1.0 out of 100,000. The DPRK was at 16.1 out of 100,000.  That's partially my fault. I don't like people or cars in my travel photos."
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,EminGH,4,Mon Jun 22 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"You seem a bit delusional. It's kinda embarrassing to witness you flailing around with your weird, pointless conspiracy theories.   There was plenty of food available in Pyongyang. There just was. I don't know what else to say about that. There...was. Deal with it. I was agreeing with the fact that there were starving people in the DPRK - more than in other places. I didn't see any starving people personally, but there is plenty of information available about it...and so... I quoted some of the information available. I pointed out that starvation in the DPRK is 16x more prevalent than in the US. That's deflection? How so? Here's my instagram. Notice the number of people in the travel photos.   This is really pathetic and sad. You know absolutely nothing, and yet you feel the need to argue with the personal experiences of other people. None of the the things you listed are even remotely questionable or unreasonable. It's just...bizarre. I feel sorry for you."
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,lsma,3,Tue Jun 23 05:38:48 2015 UTC,jesus what the fuck is wrong with you? Your parents should have paid more attention to you as a child

NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,OldRowSwoodsy,3,Tue Jun 23 10:17:45 2015 UTC,It's not worth arguing with you if you don't understand what others have already told you
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,OldRowSwoodsy,3,Tue Jun 23 10:25:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone call you names. I also haven't seen a single ""fact"" from you. You're just making unsubstantiated claims about other people...and they're all wrong (at least with regards to me,) which makes it even worse.  I would love to understand what it is that you're so upset about, and why you're being so aggressive. I really have been trying to give as neutral a report as I can based on the things I did and saw while I was in the DPRK, but it seems to have made you legitimately angry. I'm honestly not sure how to respond.  What about my experience upsets you? What about it makes you think I'm being disingenuous in my descriptions? I haven't said that the DPRK is a paradise. I haven't said that they don't have huge problems. If anything, I've pointed out some relatively boring pieces of information when compared to the rest of the world - things no one would ever mention if they traveled to the UK or US or Spain because they would be too mundane. So why does that make you so suspicious? Is it really so unbelievable that there is food in the country? Or that the capital city has people in it? Or that I didn't feel unsafe as a tourist?  What were your expectations? Do you think that the DPRK was a 24-hour torture fest for everyone who lives there? Did you expect it to be more...I dunno, third world? Why does having those expectations challenged lead you to take such an aggressive, accusatory tone? Wouldn't it be better to adjust your expectations based on new information?  When I speak to someone who has been somewhere I haven't, I like to use it as a learning experience. I want to understand the world, and if travel has taught me anything, it's been that the world is never what you expected. It's always surprising, and always more ""familiar"" than you would have ever thought. It's simultaneously disappointing and exhilarating.  In the end, your opinion on this doesn't matter to me. I would love for more people to realize that there is more to the DPRK than the headlines we see about the regime and their mistakes, but I ultimately traveled there for myself, not for anyone else. Your belief in my experiences is not necessary. I know what I know, and that's enough for me."

If you looked at my Instagram account, you would think I travel to abandoned places all the time. :-P  So for instance, for the photo of the reunification statue, I stood on the side of the road for a good 3 or 4 minutes trying to find a moment when no cars were passing by.  There were fewer cars on the road than a normal US city, but I would hardly call it empty. During rush hour, Pyongyang is fucking packed with commuters in cars and on foot - LOTS of people walking or biking around."

NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,maoista,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dogs are definitely 100% exempt for me. I can completely understand and respect that eating dogs is acceptable in some cultures, but I'm a dog lover, so when someone from the West (I'm not entirely sure where OP is from) said that they ate dog meat while in NK, it just kind of threw me off, because I would never eat any animal I would have as a pet."
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,KazOondo,15,Tue Jun 23 00:16:38 2015 UTC,Sorry if I came off as a dick. I just get pissed at this anti-dog-eating sentiment because it makes me think people don't realize the meat they eat came from an animal that can be just as cute and loving as a dog. It just seems hypocritical to criticize (or even express disgust openly at) another cultures choice in meat when you could just as easily have a cow as a pet.
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,gymnasticRug,7,Tue Jun 23 00:30:42 2015 UTC,I also really hate that eating dogs is shocking to some people. Would you eat lamb or chicken?
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,KazOondo,7,Tue Jun 23 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"I chose to eat it because it was an opportunity that I might never get again, and I prefer having more experiences to fewer. I also don't really relate to speciesism. I believe that meat is meat, and that includes all animals including humans. My emotional attachments to certain creatures (like my dog, who is my best friend in the world and a total bad-ass) doesn't change the fact that they're made of meat. In the grand scheme of things, eating one meat is no different from eating another...in my opinion!  There are certainly other opinions! And lucky for us, most of us on reddit will never be in a situation where we're forced to choose between our opinions and starvation...so there's nothing for us to worry about! You keep on not eating dog, and I'll keep visiting the Taco Bell drive through every few months. ;-)"
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,NeanerBeaner,2,Tue Jun 23 05:51:43 2015 UTC,So much food? I thought people were starving there.
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,sinarb,4,Wed Jun 17 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"There was plenty of food available in Pyongyang. Restaurants, bars, supermarkets, street food in certain areas, coffee shops, convenience stores, etc. I ate at some restaurants outside of the capital as well (the dog meat stew was in Kaesong.)  Obviously being a tourist and living there are two different things, but there were Koreans partaking in most of the places that I ate, and I saw plenty of delicious looking picnics being enjoyed out in the parks and around town on the weekend, so it's not as if it was only for tourists.  The DPRK has had issues with food. The people depend on the government to provide them with what they need, and when that doesn't happen, shit gets bad. I imagine there are starving people there, just as there are in every country - probably a lot more. There are hungry people in DC a few miles from where I live right now - probably some near you too."
NorthKoreaPics,3753fx,sinarb,0,Wed Jun 17 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"None of them are starving to death like they do in the North Korea, certainly."

I can't be sure if this is the May Day holiday, but if so, I watched the mass dances in Kim Il-Sung square that night.  Based on the time of day, this looks like it was from one of the practice sessions that took place in the days leading up to the event. There was some serious practice going on - 10 to 12 thousand dancers all learning the same steps in unison. There were also some very focused faces.  The night of the actual dance, everyone was all smiles. It was definitely a party atmosphere and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  So don't let the serious faces throw you. Korean people can BEAM, and are never far from a smile. :-)"

NorthKoreaPics,32fl82,mying_baw,3,Tue Apr 14 10:59:06 2015 UTC,"Tilt–shift photography:       Tilt–shift photography is the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras, and sometimes specifically refers to the use of tilt for selective focus, often for simulating a miniature scene.  Sometimes the term is used when the large depth of field is simulated with digital post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt–shift lens) normally required when the effect is produced optically.  ""Tilt–shift"" encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift.    Image i - Example for a creative photograph taken with a tilt-shift lens. The lens was shifted downwards to avoid perspective distortion: all vertical lines of the skyscrapers run parallel to the edges of the image. Tilting around the vertical axis resulted in a very small region in which objects appear sharp. (The depth of field is actually not reduced but tilted in reference to the image plane.)

The guides actually got pretty upset with me, but eventually I won them over with US treats like Rice Krispies (no joke).  I took 2 cameras around, a DSLR and a smaller one for more discrete shots. Because this wasn't exactly a tourist group, I think we had more liberties."

NorthKoreaPics,32d77y,digimer,6,Sun Apr 12 22:11:05 2015 UTC,"That was one heck of a photo set, and very fascinating!  Would you go back again, if you could? You seemed to be getting along well there, but the end you wrote like you couldn't wait to leave.   If I can ask a second question; What was the purpose of them blacking out the ROK and US doctor names? I imagine everyone knew, so was it more not wanting to get in trouble, or did it seem to be a genuine desire to censor anything ""good"" from ROK/USA?  Thanks for sharing!"
NorthKoreaPics,32d77y,digimer,3,Sun Apr 12 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"I would go back in a heartbeat! The only issue is $$$ which I do not have. It may have seemed like I wanted to leave, but I think it was 1) during my school year and 2) a bit anxiety-inducing there.  I'm really not sure as to why they blacked out the names. We didn't ask the guides. Plus, throughout the articles, they seem to share the last names as reference anyway. I think they didn't want to let the doctors try to make any attempts to contact them? My only guess!"
NorthKoreaPics,32d77y,digimer,3,Sun Apr 12 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying!  Did you get any insight into what, if any, medical facilities exist for DPRK residents not living in the affluent areas? Building on that question; Is there any way that you know of where people could help the ""regular"" people of DPRK get medical treatment?   From all I've heard, trying to provide aid of any type is redirected to the party faithful and doesn't make it to the poorer parts of the country. I'd love to be able to help, but I worry any aid would simply prop up/extend the regime and be counter-productive in the end.  Thanks again! I really hope the knowledge you shared can help the DPRK people, elite or otherwise. No one in that country lives well, I think, and any relief you and others can give is a gift. :)  *edit: accidentalied a word"
NorthKoreaPics,32d77y,Grainerie,3,Sun Apr 12 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the questions! Yes. We got to visit a village hospital in Wonsan. We were not permitted to take photos, but it was pretty bad. We were mainly in Pyongyang though.  Most of the patients we treated were actually ""regular"" or from the villages. We went to the common hospital, though we did also visit an elite one too.  Yes. That's why humanitarian workers and missionaries are so effective, because they work in the grassroots. If you would like to go/help, get connected with NGOs or medical agencies that go! Haha your questions are appreciated. Thanks for the time, and I hope it was informative!"
NorthKoreaPics,32d77y,Grainerie,3,Sun Apr 12 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"It was very informative.  I would love nothing more than to go visit the DPRK myself one day. My work keeps me quite busy, so it's not likely to happen in the near future though.  Can you recommend some NGOs that are effective at helping regular North Koreans?

NK likes to doll up specific locations to lead people to that look ok from the outside, but in reality are decrepit and in total disarray."

They don't want people spreading lies about their country or making their country look bad. I don't see why anyone would be surprised those kinds of photos are banned.  They have a reputation and image they want to project to the world. They want to seem stronger than they really are. They can't afford the types of campaigns and actions that other countries take part in to make themselves look strong. It's just not feasible.   Nobody cares when Americans die from the effects of malnutrition. There is so much awesome stuff in America, seeing a homeless person dead outside is a drop in the ocean. However the same picture from North Korea would cause everyone to assume it is a regular occurrence.  So yeah, it makes complete sense they want these types of pictures banned. Even these pictures leave more questions than answers. And that's the whole point."
NorthKoreaPics,2y320y,OhLook__ItsThatGuy,12,Fri Mar 6 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, it makes logical sense that they want the pictures banned, but just the simple fact that they try to control something like that speaks volumes.  It's the 21st century.  In almost every country on earth you can take a picture of pretty much anything you want in a public setting.  The control they exert is very Orwellian; their reaction to the pictures speaks more about their oppressive culture than the pictures themselves."

NorthKoreaPics,2y320y,Aserong,8,Fri Mar 6 07:06:19 2015 UTC,"First off, no communist country ever called themselves communist, only socialist. Secondly, Korea follows the Juche idea, completely different theory from what was in the Soviet union. Marxism-Leninism & Juche are both stupid ideologies."
NorthKoreaPics,2y320y,BendingBack,8,Fri Mar 6 08:51:21 2015 UTC,I had no idea there were different forms of communism. Can I ask what the differences are?
NorthKoreaPics,2y320y,pBeatman10,11,Mon Apr 13 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"Firstly, there's non-marxist communism, such as anarchism, which borrows over from Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. They're very staunch anti-authoritarians, anti-statists, anti-Stalinist, and anti-Leninist (anti-Leninism means rejecting the Leninist centralized Party, with a capitalized 'P')  On the Marxist side (all Marxists uphold Marx and Engels) there are the Left-Communists of which there are two traditions, the Italian tradition (Bordigism), who are 'More Leninist than Lenin', and the Dutch/German tradition (council communism or ultra-leftism), who adamantly reject parliamentary politics and Leninism. Bordigism upholds Bordiga while Ultra-lefts uphold Pannekoek, sometimes Mattick, but there's plenty of overlap between the two. Left-Communism is infamous both for its sectarianism and dogmatism, but also for its connection with academia. There are a lot of brilliant Left-Communists, but most of these academicesque intellectuals only have tenuous links to any movement. They're also staunch anti-Stalinists.  There is Trotskyism, which can be Leninist, can not be, depends on the party, but on the most part, they are. There are much much more variants Trotskyism than any other tendency (tendency = sub-ideology) because Trotskyists organizations are infamous for splitting. They uphold Lenin and Trotsky, and were borne from the exiled leader Trotsky's Left-Opposition and Fourth-International opposed to Stalinism and Socialism in One Country.  After Lenin had died, the various factions within the Communist Party each tried positing themselves as his successor. Trotsky's faction called themselves the ""Bolshevik-Leninists"" while Stalin's faction called themselves ""Marxist-Leninists"". Each accused each other of not being ""Leninist"". The Bolshevik-Leninists accused the Marxist-Leninists of being 'Stalinists' and the Marxist-Leninists accused the Bolshevik-Leninists of being 'Trotskyites'. Suffice to say, Stalin won. Marxism-Leninism as an ideology centres around Socialism in One Country, which asserts that socialism is possible in one country. After Stalin had died though, he was denounced by Khrushchev, and the Soviet Union began a process of destalinization, removing the Stalin cult and trying to relax some of the totalitarian methods of governance. Marxism-Leninism, backed from the Soviet Union, thus became destalinized. Maoism and Hoxhaism are variants of 'anti-revisionist' Marxism-Leninism, who believe that the post-Stalin USSR betrayed communism through denouncing Stalin, market reforms, 'peaceful coexistence', and social-imperialism.  Funny thing about Juche an North Korea is that during destalinization, there wasn't much to 'destalinize' as in getting rid of statues of stalin and so on, because by that time, North Korea was already a bizarre isolated country with a massive cult of Kim. The writings of Marx and Lenin were rarely teached, even more so today, since DPRK gives less lip-service to Marxism-Leninism than China does; all they really have are caricatured ideals taken through the simplified lens of Kim il-Sung and Kim Jung-il and borrowed over symbolism and art styles, rather than actually reading Marx. Juche centres around Korean ultra-nationalism, a doctrinairified cult of personality (there have been many cults of personalities, but no other communists country has ever made it into an ideological principle), that the military is everything, a rejection of basic tenents of the materialist conception of history while still paying lip service to it, and a vague ideal where the development of history has been a consequence of ""Man"", that the universe is centred around ""Man"", that Juche is the ideology of ""the interests of Man"", in other words, an underhanded rejection of class struggle. Quite a bit of Juche seems to arrive at conclusions taken from jargon without fully realized the concepts the jargon represents."

They saw my equipment off the top of the trip and knew I would be taking lots of pictures, so they told me some ground rules which I followed (mostly...haha) and would just tell me if they weren't happy with me taking a photo and I would stop.

Yeah I see where they're coming from, and sometimes it's hard for me to make an argument against that notion. But to be honest, I'd love to go back soon, and I could recommend it to someone like you for the experience."
NorthKoreaPics,2xukfh,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,3,Wed Mar 4 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, if I can set aside some time and money for it, I'll definitely be going even if it's on my own. Cheers for the recommendation :)"
NorthKoreaPics,2xukfh,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,3,Wed Mar 4 01:18:34 2015 UTC,Definitely! And let me know if you have any other questions!
NorthKoreaPics,2xukfh,crackghost,2,Wed Mar 4 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, will do :)  Actually, on that note, what tour organizer did you go with?"
NorthKoreaPics,2xukfh,TheIronButt,3,Wed Mar 4 01:35:02 2015 UTC,"Uri Tours! And had an excellent, seamless experience with them."
NorthKoreaPics,2xukfh,VeryShagadelic,2,Wed Mar 4 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks. I knew about Koryo before, but Uri is new to me. I'll be sure to weigh my options when I get ready to go."

I'd seen the first one and you look at it and you're like yeah whatever, looks about normal. I don't know why the second one gets me though...It makes NK look like an ocean and there's a couple of islands dotted in there sort of like Indonesia or Malaysia.  Madness..."

NorthKoreaPics,2xsone,BurgerBuoy,17,Tue Mar 3 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"I've always enjoyed pictures of the Pyongyang Subway.   Like all of North Korea, it has this very pristine ""This thing was made in 1981 and never used"" quality to it.   Largely because that's exactly what happened. But I still love the Cold War, 1980's style it's got."
