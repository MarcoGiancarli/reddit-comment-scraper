Also I am not one of those people stealing the sign, its just a pain to tell people to turn on 420th and they can't find the turn because the sign is missing."
minnesota,3dzhrn,WhiteKidUKnow,4,Mon Jul 20 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"My home county in Wisconsin has a 420th Ave that's in a rural area. It's actually a very nice drive along the river through rolling hills, and is labeled as a 'rustic road' by the state. A great place to take a cruise and burn one, if that's your thing. I digress however.   The solution they ended up with was painting '420th Ave' directly onto the pole. No more sign. Nobody wants to steal a painted metal pole. Unsure of how many previous signs were stolen before they tried something new."

minnesota,3duzzl,BevansDesign,3,Mon Jul 20 03:31:10 2015 UTC,I tend to think the danger isn't as simple as that. The amount of wealth the top 0.01% has is largely in stock holdings and therefore in constant flux and recycling itself in the form of stock buybacks to artificially inflate its own worth. It's such an absurdly huge amount and so much of it is a type of credit there's a risk to the greater economy.  If more and more of our currency is tied up in credit it's therefore only worth as much as you believe it's worth.  Once people stop believing their money is worth anything that's a big problem. It's beyond any petty jealousy or class warfare: those with the most are playing a dangerous game with our common currency.

minnesota,3duzzl,markhameggs,5,Mon Jul 20 03:57:43 2015 UTC,Any limit you'll put on it is entirely arbitrary. Doesn't that bother you at all?
minnesota,3duzzl,dkinmn,5,Mon Jul 20 04:03:52 2015 UTC,I'm not for putting any limit on it.  I am for a sensible wage for CEO's and other higher ups.   Some of these CEO salaries are just insane.
minnesota,3duzzl,markhameggs,4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"What is and isn't sensible? Is that that a limit? Whether by law or otherwise, you're saying there should be one."
minnesota,3duzzl,dkinmn,3,Mon Jul 20 10:46:32 2015 UTC,"No I just think it is in poor taste to pay some of these CEO's the amount of money that they are making.  It makes the people you employ feel like shit knowing that you wipe your ass with their salaries.    As far as a law or limit/cap on CEO salaries go, I am absolutely against it.   I guess the thing that upsets me the most is the corporate greed in the world and how little the common men and women are compensated for their hard work.    For example the company I work for has regular town hall meetings where the CEO boasts about record profits each quarter, and then the company goes and gets rid of the $20 gym membership reimbursement from the health insurance plan.  Its just in really bad taste."
minnesota,3duzzl,markhameggs,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:29 2015 UTC,"How can you say it in poor taste to pay them what they're being laid, and then say you are not for a limit? How can you be against paying them what they're being paid and not be for a limit? How is something limited without a limit?"

You seem to be saying it is actually harmful to pay CEOs extravagant salaries. Unless you don't think it's harmful, and you literally just don't like it for reasons that have nothing to do with economics. If it's just, ""I don't like that they make so much more than other people for no reason other than that it seems like a lot of money to give someone,"" then...who cares? That's your problem. Same as the fat lady in the tube top."
minnesota,3duzzl,dkinmn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"Oh I won't pretend to know anything about the economy.  My opinion is that when you boat about record profits and are making Millions, you should also pass some of that down to the people who are helping make those record profits happen.  I believe in rewarding people for hard work, and those employees that don't work hard and don't do good work should not be rewarded.   I am not asking for people to get something they don't deserve.  My problem going back to the article is that while their salaries grow, the employees stay the same, and the gap gets even wider."
minnesota,3duzzl,markhameggs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"It's harmful in the sense that hoarded money does nothing for nobody.  The obscenely wealthy don't need that money for any reason; they're just racking up a high score that means nothing.  As for a cap, I don't know if that would work.  A progressive tax rate that gets higher with income would still allow a person to make as much money as they please, but it would be considerably more difficult because they'd keep experiencing diminishing returns.  Because really, why should it be easy for a multi-millionaire to get even more millions?"

minnesota,3dwm06,Dnrdni,4,Mon Jul 20 03:53:43 2015 UTC,I do really like Mankato for the fact that it is a great town and there are always things going on. Do you know much about the different school systems in the area? Like elementary through high school systems?
minnesota,3dwm06,Dnrdni,2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:29 2015 UTC,West high school is in the top 10 in the state.  (Daughter just graduated and is will be attending minn state)  elementary and junior high are best in North Mankato in my opinion.
minnesota,3dwm06,OneAct,6,Mon Jul 20 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"South-eastern Minnesota might be something you'd be interested in. There are a handful of decent sized cities along with a lot of small towns. Rochester and Winona are the bigger ones in that area. But if you didn't want to live in either of those cities there are a lot of small rural towns that wouldn't be much of a commute.   I don't know exactly what type of company or service you'd be employed through but with Mayo Clinic near by that could be a possibility, if that's not at all what you are looking for I'm sure you could find it somewhere in those towns! Also your SO would have a larger selection of job opportunities in Rochester/Winona.   As far as education Minnesota is a great choice! I went to a small school, only graduated with 57, but still got a great education and am now attending the University of Minnesota. Obviously I'm bias but I'd encourage you to at least consider living in a small town. There are tons of benefits most people not might realize if they've never experienced, but I also know it's not for everyone.   I hope this was help in some kind of way. Keep in mind this based off of my personal experience but hopefully it offered you something! Let me know if you have any other questions."
minnesota,3dwm06,OneAct,4,Mon Jul 20 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of living near Rochester, especially with the Mayo Clinic there. I grew up going to a Mayo Clinic for everything. If they have positions in my field I would love to work there. My dad is employed at Mayo and gets great health insurance. Do you know much about the school systems near Rochester? I'd prefer to have my kids go to a smaller high school with a grad class of 50-60 because that's what I had too.   I agree with the living in a small town. SO even maybe wants a house in the country, I'm not so sure though.   Thanks so much for your reply!"
minnesota,3dwm06,Tuilere,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:08 2015 UTC,"So I am no expert by any means about this stuff but I will share what I know first hand. I know more about the small towns because I am from one and a little about some of the bigger city schools.   If you are looking for a smaller high school that's is strong and is close to Rochester I would look into St. Charles or Dover-Eyota. SC has the best testing scores in the area with DE not far behind. I will say though that DE has really picked up their game over the last few years. There actually some students from Roch that will go to DE since they have open enrollment. SC is also good from the standpoint that it has been doing very well academically for quite some time.   Both communities offer different feeling depending on what you are looking for. Some other schools in the area worth mentioning but I don't know enough to talk about in detail are Byron, Zumbrota-Mazzepa, and Plainview-Elgin-Millville.  Again this is one random person on the internet giving his opinion so look into them yourself and see what you might like. I'm not that well versed in this are (and I probably should be seeing that I'm going to be a teacher) but I hope it helped."
minnesota,3dwm06,OneAct,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"Also, please don't judge a school solely by its testing scores. Consider your own studies as an addiction counselor. There aren't checkboxes for right and wrong for every scenario, and the state tests don't do a good job of testing critical thinking skills or measuring exposure to scientific methods, social sciences, art or music."
minnesota,3dwm06,sweetberrywhine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"You're totally right /u/Tuilere! There are tons of other factors that I can't speak on, but I'll try to expand on those point and keep things short here.   Theatre wise SC is far stronger. That have a fall musical that had been directed by the same man who is an extremely good actor/director and does that kind of stuff year round. Also their One Act play had gone to State numerous times in that last ten years. DE is kind of hit or miss when it comes to theatre.   They also both have very strong agricultural education/FFA chapters as well. As an FFA alumni member I have to push that but it is something that typically small rural schools are good at.   Also a lot comes down to whether or not you like the towns. They both have very different feels community wise in what they have to offer. Again best of luck in your decision making!"

minnesota,3dmqdm,Yay295,3,Sat Jul 18 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"Downtown Stillwater will have a better night life. Downtown historic Hudson (ie; old hudson) is cool and has a handful of bars etc. Both are charming little downtowns, but both suffer from suburban sprawl on their edges.   Also, that commute isn't that bad. You could live in lowertown st. paul or up on cathedral hill and get to uw rf in like 35 minutes. I drive even further every day right now.

minnesota,3dmqdm,grundhog,2,Fri Jul 17 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, Stillwater might arguably be a worse commute than Saint Paul because of the historic river crossing there.  And I think Stillwater is also further from River Falls than Saint Paul.  I think /u/worduphomefry has the right idea. Makes more sense from a financial perspective and a commute perspective to live closer to school.  Because traffic from Saint Paul to the 494/694 interchange east of the city will still likely be slow going."
minnesota,3dmqdm,grundhog,2,Fri Jul 17 21:30:25 2015 UTC,Stillwater is a bit closer and you don't have to deal with city traffic as long as you don't do downtown.
minnesota,3dmqdm,Capitol62,3,Sat Jul 18 05:06:24 2015 UTC,I lived in Cathedral Hill in Saint Paul (my favorite area in the cities) and commuted to River Falls for school for a year. I really didn't mind the commute as I loved living in Saint Paul.

minnesota,3di5aj,kmo9e,14,Thu Jul 16 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Fundamental science is a public good that wouldn't be funded if it weren't for public dollars. The Vikings are a moneymaking machine that would exist regardless of public financial input. It's not a ""where should we spend a specific pile of money"" question. It's a philosophical point of whether hundreds of millions of public dollars are better spent enriching our knowledge of the universe or enriching wealthy people from other states."

Is this always the case? I'm not familiar with pre-Target Field downtown, but it seems like on Twins gamedays, every bar and restaurant is humming. Have they always been like that, regardless of stadium location?  It looks like they (businesses) are benefitting from the Twins fans piling into downtown, is it different between baseball and football? Is Target Field an exception to the observation that businesses surrounding a sports stadium do not benefit from its proximity?"
minnesota,3di5aj,new_process,2,Fri Jul 17 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is a lot of new stadiums are built in less than desirable neighborhoods, so people don't want to spend time in the surrounding area. Target field and the new Vikings stadium are in more desirable areas than a lot of stadiums, and Minneapolis has also specifically targeted building up the surrounding area along with stadium development. I think this makes Target Field and (hopefully) the new stadium a bit of an exception from the norm."
minnesota,3di5aj,backwoodsbill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:50:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a decent article that goes over some of the high level issues at play.  While certain individual business may see a spike during events, that spike in one sector typically comes at a cost to other sectors. For example, building a stadium has a negative impact on the retail and service industries in the area.  Additionally, as this paper describes, many of the people going to bars near a stadium are simply spending money near the stadium instead of spending that money closer to home. The money is often simply being redistributed from areas without a stadium to areas with a stadium.  So whether or not the stadium is an economic benefit depends on what business you have a stake in (and where), and whether you are looking at the impact on a micro or a macro level."
minnesota,3di5aj,tanis7x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:38:29 2015 UTC,"I think it depends. Some places hugely benefit, look what the Xcel did for Saint Paul. Cossets went from big to gigantic and has had multiple remodels and like 4 times the space now with multiple restaurants. McGoverns added a huge outdoor all season patio with a retractable roof and heaters and multiple bars. Liffy added beautiful rooftop space as well. Tom Reids, Burger Moes, Eagle Street, all came after the arena was built, and all doing really well. The hotels are all doing better too.  So it definitely depends on the venues location I think. Vikings is a shit bet because there's only 8 home games a year. At least with baseball and hockey there's tons more games a year."

The reason I did is because the new fast internet CenturyLink has doesn't reach our house, it misses by a couple hundred feet. I'll pretty much split my bill in half (I have DirectTV) by switching and get faster internet.   My recommendation is finding out what the rates and speeds are of both and compare. If Comcast has specials going on and your an existing customer, you can call and tell them you are thinking about switching and they should bring you back down to the lower rate. If not, head to CenturyLink."
minnesota,3dm99c,sajimo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:35 2015 UTC,It's going to vary wildly for both Centurylink and Comcast depending on the location.

I think I paid $300 all told back in the day, so that's actually pretty reasonable."
minnesota,3dgdy8,Melivora_capensis,2,Thu Jul 16 02:36:45 2015 UTC,You only need to hold your permit for 3 months and you don't need to take any sort of approved driving lessons before taking the road test.  You can ride with a licensed parent or friend in the passenger seat to teach you how to drive.  Keep reading the driver's manual and watch youtube videos about parallel parking and the 90 degree backing maneuver because the person you learn from might be wrong/out of touch.

There's also a vision test.  Be sure you have all the right documents.  You can just walk in to take the permit test, but you should schedule 3 months in advance for the road test (if you live in a major city anyway).  They fill up very fast during the summer and fall."

Supply is not keeping up with demand, causing prices to go up. There is no solution here other than create more supply (well, I guess we can make the city less desirable to live in, but I don't like that solution).
