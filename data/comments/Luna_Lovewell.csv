Luna_Lovewell,3dezbg,NuclearStudent,8,Mon Jul 20 22:10:51 2015 UTC,"Something that would be seemingly mundane and boring, but as you branch out, it takes on more fantastical elements as you move further along with choices.  Bonus for different choices actually resulting in a different genre.  So maybe the setting is a neighborhood bake sale.  Depending on choice, it turns into sci-fi (alien invasion?), melodrama, horror, fantasy  etc."
Luna_Lovewell,3dezbg,hamlet_d,4,Wed Jul 15 21:33:54 2015 UTC,Branching storylines into different dramas a little excessive. Even visual novels usually only have 5-6 flags that can be triggered before the storyline gets solidified and it breaks down into pick right-choice vs wrong-choice = death.  For example Storyline A > A B > Aa Ab Ba Bb   That gives you 4 different stories(after which it's usually just linear) in only 2 branches.

Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,Pyerite,9,Fri Jul 10 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"Still no agent or publisher, sorry. I will let you know as soon as I know something!  I am thinking of writing a new 1st chapter for it, but I don't know what that would be."
Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,Luna_LoveWell,9,Fri Jul 10 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why not self publish?   Between all the fans of you on reddit (and elsewhere?) and you being the top response on the top writing prompts, I'm pretty sure you could have a successful crowd funding campaign.   I imagine you could move a lot of product at minimal cost to you if you did a digital release. Then a proper premium for a hard copy would cover any additional costs there.   Honestly, I don't think I've seen anything better primed for a grassroots crowd funding campaign. If you're worried about it, just set the bar high on the target number so that it will be sufficiently rewarding for you."
Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,The_Wach,10,Fri Jul 10 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"I have considered self publishing it. The issue is that I see this as the potential start of a new career that I know nothing about. Beyond posting here, I know nothing about advertising it or selling it or anything like that.  Traditional publishing would give me the opportunity to learn the entire process and particularly how best to build my audience and connect with people. I would have a good example and see every step. I just need to be able to get my foot in the door, and I can't seem to.  So my plan now is to take a bit of time, self-publish something, and see if I can sell copies of that. If so, then I could take that figure to a publisher and say ""here's how many I sold on my own. Imagine what I could do if you showed me how."" Currently, I have no track record of making any sales that they can see."
Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,Luna_LoveWell,8,Fri Jul 10 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"Note: this might come off as harsh at first, but I mean what I wrote respectfully and aim to help you out.  While I do love your work, I don't appreciate that attitude. It can be disheartening to be turned down, I know, but sometimes you just need to force things to work out. Improvise.  You have one finished book, and (correct me if I'm wrong) several ideas for more. You have these great skills of being a very versatile writer, able to work on different projects simultaneously, and - at least from my point of view - doing it at an impressive and constant pace. On top of that you have an established fanbase, many of whom will buy your book should it be available while the rest will probably be happy to spread news of it. All this said, I think you should just put the book up on Amazon's store.  For reference, check out the course of Andy Weir's The Martian to success. He published it as an ongoing, free series of posts and his friends and fans asked him to put it up somewhere it'll be easily accessible for ebooks. The lowest price point Amazon offered was 99 cents. He sold 35,000 copies in three months. You have 14,000 subscribed followers. Obviously that doesn't mean you'll be as successful, but in my eyes it makes a compelling argument to get an ebook out there. Don't you think?"
Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,Moppity,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"I actually see both Moppity's and your point. Do what feels right, but in the end, if the establishment is only hindering you, there are ways to break through the barrier yourself. Self-publishing is definitely a viable option in this day and age and with the number of unique subscribers to your subreddit, I see it being a good first step in terms of sales."

Most publishers don't even allow direct submissions, and the ones that do are very small publishers. So first I need to find a gatekeeper agent to help me out, which is just another hurdle."
Luna_Lovewell,3crqp4,Luna_LoveWell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"Bummer! But I wish you the best of luck!  Just curious tho, how have the agents/publishers responded to finding out you have 14000+ subscribers on reddit? That has to mean something to them, right?"

The AI can't control physical objects which means its survival is entirely reliant on electricity remaining on and a human tending to its systems. If it lets an outbreak occur then it essentially killing itself. The only choice it has for its own survival is to sabotage all human attempts to simulate better weapons. Will this miniature nuclear bomb work properly? Nope. Will this chemical weapon kill millions? Nope, just dozens and then wind disperses it. Will this new robot body work? Absolutely and I'll even suggest an improvement: remote control by a specific DoD AI."

Luna_Lovewell,3ckcg0,Luna_LoveWell,103,Wed Jul 8 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"""I know what you were doing in the Shrieking Shack,"" Walt told the Weasley twins as soon as they got onto the bridge and out of earshot of other students. ""You got lucky getting away from the Aurors like that. Let me guess, a big gulp of Felix for both of you?""   The twins shared a glance but didn't answer.  ""Well you're lucky it didn't kill you,"" Walt told them. From within his robes he removed a small vial full of pinkish liquid full of effervescent bubbles; looked a bit like boiling Pepto Bismal. ""This is one of the samples that I recovered from one of your cauldrons."" He shook the bottle for emphasis, causing the potion to turn an angry red. ""Is this the golden glow of Felix Felicis?""  ""No, sir,"" the redheaded duo answered together.  ""This is so poorly brewed that it would probably make me unlucky. I'd be stubbing toes and losing my keys before it even hit my stomach."" He threw the bottle over the side of the railing, hundreds of feet into the valley below. ""It is not a quality product. How can you expect to sell it if it isn't quality?""  ""That wasn't one of our batches,"" George protested. ""That was probably from one of the Slytherins that we were working with. They're stupid gits, but theyre the only ones who can get us the ingredients."" From his robes, he withdrew a half-empty bottle that he kept on hand in case a lovely lady happened to walk by and needed a companion. ""Here's one of ours."" His voice had a note of pride.  Professor White snatched it out of his hands and examined it. More of an ocher orange, but it was at least close to gold.   ""What is that?"" Walt asked, holding it up to his eye with the sun behind the bottle. ""Why does it... sparkle? ""  The twins exchanged glances. ""It's our signature!"" Fred answered.  ""Fairy P!"" George added.  Walt took another look, then hurled that bottle off the side of the bridge as well. George dashed to the railing, looking ready to dive over the side after it with a face that looked like he'd just been stabbed in the gut.  ""It's crap!"" Walt shouted back. He glanced around, conscious of raising his voice and making sure that no one had heard. ""It's crap, and it is unsellable. So you are going to meet me in the dungeons tonight and we are going to start brewing a real batch. And you are going to sell it for me to all of your little student friends.""  ""And why-"" George started, ""would we want to do that?"" Fred finished.   Walt gestured back up to Hogwarts. ""Or I go to Dumbledore and tell him who has been illegally supplying potions to his students."" He gestured then to the owlery. ""Or I send a message to your mother, informing her of your activities."" The two shuddered violently, probably at the thought of how many howlers they would get the next day.  ""Or I can just call the Aurors again. I know they're still out looking for you.""  ""All right,"" George said.   ""We get the message,"" Fred concurred.   ""Good. Then I'll see you tonight at midnight, in the lower dungeons.""    And if you enjoyed this, subscribe here to my subreddit!"

Luna_Lovewell,3ckcg0,Just-my-2c,3,Thu Jul 9 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"About first part: Try not to re-read some because it isn't as fluent then anymore. I think you said ""Shrieking Shack... Shack"" once in there. Another thing is when the text says ""whispered"" you could lower the volume of your voice a bit. But let's go over the good bits.  I liked it. It isn't too fast or too slow, just right. The volume in general is good and your Harry Potter pronunciation mishaps aren't as bad in my opinion as you thought them to be. ;D  Onwards to part 2: Overall about the same as part 1, but this time it seemed like you were trying to give each of the characters another kind of voice. I like how you speak the voice of Walt; George and Fred aren't badly spoken either in my opinion.  And thank you for reading this out loud, it is nice.

Luna_Lovewell,3cfeaw,Judasthehammer,23,Tue Jul 7 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"He lives in North Korea and knows nothing about Texas. He assumes that there are rice farmers all over.  But yes, Texas does grow rice."
Luna_Lovewell,3cfeaw,LowlyLurker,10,Tue Jul 7 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"I got that, I just was suddenly afraid that we had an entire agricultural sector that I knew nothing about... Like when someone says that there really are green shelled eggs that are the root of Green Eggs and Ham. You think that's just silly talk.. until one day you find out that there really are green shelled chicken eggs! So. Yeah. I got paranoid and checked. And... yeah. :)"
Luna_Lovewell,3cfeaw,DCheeso06,5,Tue Jul 7 17:21:30 2015 UTC,The funny thing is the Texas rice farmers are big corporate. They're the only ones that benefited during the worst drought in 100 years!. Draining all the lakes for the rice farmers' use cost home owner's and the state billions; property value's plummeted.  But I digress..  Nice attention to detail Luna; as always!

I watched all the movies of Harry Potter but never read the books but the way you wrote the story it was more than amazing. With your story you showed me why people like to read. It was late that day and I was tired (plus I should have studied) but it was so exciting that I couldn't stop reading it. Full of mistery and wonder and your writing style helped me to visualise everything. It was surreal. I might even pick up Rowling's books during the summer.

So I guess that this story would be a prequel to the one below:    [WP] Superhero is married to his/her arch nemesis; both being aware and content with the situation while still going about their day to day hero and villain escapades.    I settled into our cozy couch and flipped through Netflix, looking for a good movie that we hadn't already watched. He was in the kitchen, opening up a bottle of wine. Tippy, our cat, lazed about in front of the crackling fire, soaking up warmth. These were my favorite types of evening: no going out, no wild partying, just a quiet night at home.  ""Oh, the Nightmare Before Christmas sounds good!"" he said as he entered the room holding two glasses.   ""We can't watch that every day between Halloween and Christmas,"" I chided him with a feigned look of exasperation. It was his favorite movie. He grinned back. ""Who is going to stop me?"" He handed me a glass and nestled up against me on the couch.   ""I am!"" I responded with a kiss, and removed it from our queue. He smirked at me, but didn't protest.  My communicator started beeping urgently, rattling across the coffee table. Tippy awoke from her slumber, annoyed that her human slaves would disturb her beauty sleep. She gave an irritated yawn, a huge stretch, and promptly fell back asleep.   I put down the wine and flipped it open. The mayor was on the line. ""Oh thank god!"" he yelled, putting his face way too close to the video screen. ""Oh god. There's a bomb in the nuclear power plant! If someone doesn't get in there and disarm it, it's going to melt down and kill everyone!!""  I rolled my eyes. He always thinks it's going to take out the whole town, I said to myself. ""Where did it come from, Mayor?"" I asked with a firm air of authority.   ""As if you even need to ask!"" he shouted back. ""It was Professor Carnage!!""   I sighed, shooting daggers at my partner across the couch. He shrugged, smiling sheepishly. ""Get down here right away,"" the Mayor continued.   ""I'll be there in a flash,"" I promised, closing the communicator.   ""I hate you so much,"" I told my husband. He took a sip of wine and grabbed the remote control from my hand. ""Don't you need to go change?"" he responded with a laugh.  I groaned loudly and got up from the couch to go find my costume. ""This is halloween, this is halloween,"" I heard him humming happily behind me."

Behind him, one of the robots wheeled in with a bowl of soup, sloshing it over the sides of the bowl and onto my hardwood floors. Behind that one, a second robot trailed with a mop and a towel. Isaac knew that his minions weren't allowed in the house, but I was too tired to yell at them right now. And I could really go for some of that soup; it smelled delicious.   ""Feeling any better?"" he asked. I groaned in response and fumbled for the tissues that had somehow fallen out of my grasp. One of the robots snaked around the side of the bed and handed them to me. I tried to glare at it, but I could barely keep my eyes open with all the drugs I was on.   ""Well, just get your rest,"" he said. ""I'm sure the city will be fine without you for a few days.""

Don't you dare do anything while I'm sick, or 'Professor Carnage' is going to get the beating of a lifetime, complete with a nice wad of snot liberally smeared all over 'his' face.""   He laughed. ""You're disgusting. And I love you."" He kissed me again on the forehead. ""I'm serious, though. The city is going to be fine without you. I have no plans to rob, destroy, kidnap, or otherwise terrorize the fair people of Fictionburg without you there to stop me.""   ""You promise?"" I asked, making my most pitiful face and clutching at my bowl of soup.   ""Of course,"" he said. ""Just sit back and relax. Here, watch some TV."" He hit 'Power' on the remote, and the screen in the corner snapped to life.   We now go live to the scene at Allied Metro Depository, where the Dreamweaver has taken hostages and is threatening to release a cloud of toxic gas onto the city unless his demands are met.   The helicopter's camera was hovering over the building where I could just barely see flashes of crimson and black from the villain's spider-inspired costume. He specialized in hallucinogens and other toxic chemicals, and was a constant pain in my ass.   ""God damn it,"" I muttered, spilling my soup as I tried to hurry out of bed. ""Can you help me find my costume?""  As if on cue, the communicator on the bedside table started to buzz. I could already imagine the mayor on the other end, red-faced and panicking as usual. I moaned in annoyance and reached for it, but Isaac was too fast.  ""Oh, no,"" He said firmly, pushing me back against the covers. ""No no no. You are in no shape to go fight, much less against Dreamweaver. Hell, with your fever you're probably already hallucinating!""  I could only moan in response, still feebly grasping for the buzzing communicator in his hand.   ""I'll take care of everything, honey."" He turned to one of the robots by my bedside. ""TERI, you're on guard duty. See that she doesn't leave the bed. JERI,"" he said, turning to the other, ""You're the gopher. Get her anything she needs.""  ""Yes, sir!"" their tinny voices answered in unison. And with that, he left the room.     The situation has gone from bad to worse down here at the Allied Metro Depository! It seems that Dreamweaver's robbery drew the attention of Professor Carnage, whose hovercraft landed on the roof just moments ago! Sources within the police department suggest that the two villains may be working together!   The helicopter made another pass over the bank, where the police were retreating to a safe distance while Isaac's robots scuttled out of his ship and established a perimeter around the bank. At last, I saw him emerge from the ship through a cloud of vapor and wearing his full outfit, looking somewhat like Darth Vader stepping into Princess Leia's shuttle.    Ok, Professor Carnage has entered the bank! Still no sight of Ms. Magnificent, though she always arrives in the knick of time. Let's just hope that she's on her way! We now go live to Mike Hernandez down on the ground level, who should be able to see into the building a bit better...   I moaned, but TERI surrounded me in a pillow prison. JERI skittered up nervously, waiting to be assigned a new task.   Ok, we can see Professor Carnage approaching the Dreamweaver, flanked by his minions. Yes... yes, they are shaking hands! It looks like the police are going to be dealing with double trouble now!   The camera zoomed in to show Isaac's heavy gloved hand gripped the Dreamweaver's. Then... BOOM! Isaac socked the (other) villain right in the jaw! Robots swarmed around the Dreamwaver, who was spraying them with his hallucinogens with no effect. He simply hadn't been prepared to fight robots...   What is happening here?   The newscaster and the police were going crazy. Dreamweaver was tied up and dragged out by a team of Isaac's robots.  ""Let it be known!"" Isaac announced, voice amplified by his suit's mask. ""That this bank, and all banks of the city, are MINE. No one touches my property without my permission! And for Ms. Magnificent out there, you owe me one!""  I groaned and rolled over, back to sleep. I hated owing him favors..."

Luna_Lovewell,3apwp0,Sokonit,241,Mon Jun 22 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"""So what do we do now?"" I asked. The smoldering wreckage of the couch between us crackled and popped as the wood frame began to fall apart. The rest of the house was in shambles, with holes in most of the walls and pieces of robot lodged into every remaining scrap of furniture. I was surprised that the neighbors hadn't called the cops yet; we were only a mile away. This ruckus could probably have been heard all the way from downtown.  ""I don't know,"" he panted, still trying to catch his breath. Two of his robot minions were lurking in the corners of the room, just waiting for his signal. Where had they all come from? Did he have an endless supply coming from his lair in the basement? The piles around the house of sparking wires and other twisted metal parts were growing unreasonably large.   We both stared at each other for a while. He had the same smug, cocky smile that I'd seen on Professor Carnage's face a hundred times, but he was always wearing the visor. How had I never recognized him? God, how could I have been such an idiot? There were so many signs, like how despite being a professor at the local technical institute, he managed to afford extravagant vacations and jewelry. 'Family money,' my ass!  ""How could you keep up this charade for so long?"" I asked.   He shrugged, always casual. ""I do everything ahead of time,"" he said. ""I'm a planner. Whenever the action happens, I can just sit back and watch. And all of the cloaking devices and shielding for my bunker lab helped, too.""  I had no response. All those times that I had to fly off when we were together had all been his fault!  ""If it makes any difference,"" he continued, ""I figured out your secret months ago.""  ""Whaaa... how?"" I asked. I was always so careful! I hid my costumes so well every time he came over, except for that one time where he wanted to do a little role play. He had been impressed with the authenticity of my costume...  ""Oh, please."" He laughed. ""You make terrible excuses. Like, so terrible that I don't know how you thought you were still convincing. I'd be willing to bet that like half of your coworkers know, too. Pretty much every time we're watching the news and there's some big disaster, you run off saying that you left your cat in the refrigerator or something. Give me a little credit: I'm one of the smartest men in the world, and I built a robotic army from scratch. You didn't think I'd connect the dots?""  His robots snickered at me. I still can't believe he programmed them to do that.   ""And,"" he said, ""all this time that I've known about you, I didn't once use it against you or do anything to hurt you. I would never do anything to really put you in danger.""  That was true, I guess...  ""On the contrary, it only made me feel closer to you. I mean, we both have this secret life that we've been living and nobody that we can ever share it with. And now we do! We have each other! I mean, I had to invent a damn time manipulator that gives me 48-hour days, just so that I'd be able to spend more time with you while still maintaining our life together!"" he pulled the device from one of his suit compartments. ""But it was all worth it, because I've loved every minute."" He looked down at the machine. ""And you gotta admit, a pocket time manipulator is pretty cool.""   I laughed, then remembered how angry I was at him. My frown returned, but he was still grinning. ""And I could go down into my lab right now and find that memory ray that I tried to use against the President last October, and stop you from remembering that you ever discovered the secret door in the basement,"" he told me. ""But I'm not going to. Because we've needed to have this talk for a while.""  ""I can't date a supervillain,"" I told him. ""You're... you're evil!""  He shrugged. ""And you're a goody-two shoes who doesn't realize what potential you have. But I don't care!! The only thing that really makes a difference is how we feel about each other! I'd still love you if you had any other job in the universe, and so I still love you even though you're a superhero.""   I bit my lip. I can't date a villain! What would everyone say? How could I trust him after he lied to me for all this time? Although I did lie to him too... Oh, fuck it.  I flew across the room in a flash. The robots jumped to life, ready to defend their master. But as soon as I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him deeply, they relaxed again.   ""Why do you always make things so difficult?"" I told him, then kissed him again before he could answer.  ""So does that mean we're not breaking up?"" he managed to finally get out.  ""On two conditions,"" I told him sternly.   ""Anything,"" he answered.  ""First, no more attacking civilians. Ever. I don't want people getting hurt in your schemes.""  He pursed his lips and considered it. ""Deal,"" he said finally. ""I like a challenge. What's the other condition?""  I plucked the time machine from his hand. ""This one is mine now."" That will certainly make things easier."

A villain with more humanity and less egomania than usual. A hero that has strong morals but acknowledges that she's flawed. A couple that proves the importance of choosing who and how you love.

Luna_Lovewell,3apwp0,ancientcampus,5,Tue Jun 23 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm definitely not questioning his ability to do it in that universe. But even in our world you wouldn't have to explicitly program a response for every possible scenario. You typically just have to dump a lot of past conversations of some archetype so the robot can learn to emulate that personality.  A real world example is http://www.cleverbot.com/, which just pattern matches your reply to past conversations it had with other people on the internet. It definitely doesn't do anything like if (prompt == 'How are you?') reply = 'I'm fine'; and is much more generic."

Luna_Lovewell,3aahxn,Luna_LoveWell,83,Thu Jun 18 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"Only two weeks had passed since Maester Dumbledore and Ser Hagrid rescued Harry from the Dursley's torturous wardship. It had pained Maester Dumbledore to keep him there, but it was the only safe option. Turns out, Dudley had been right all along: it was an evil shadowbinder, by the name of Voldemort, who had killed his parents. And who had marked his forehead with the lightning scar. Moat Privet was one of the oldest castles in the region, and those old stones had been carved with wards of the Children of the Forest. Ancient magic, far beyond the knowledge of a shadowbinder, even one as powerful as Voldemort. He would be unable to breach the fortifications, especially not in his current state. After his assault on Castle Hogwarts and murder of Harry's mother and father, he'd fled the country, hiding out in the Red Wastes of Essos. But there were rumors that he was gathering his power and might someday return.   Harry's breakfast was interrupted by a call of trumpets from the gates. Hagrid ducked under the arched doorway into the main hall. His cloak was a rich scarlet trimmed with gold, the colors of House Potter. ""Another visitor, my lord.""  Harry nodded to let him in, still uncertain of the protocol in these situations. A dozen neighboring lords had come calling in recent days to congratulate him on his return to his seat. House Potter's lands were prosperous and rich, and they were eager to curry favor. Each convoy brought a host of gifts; House Weasely had even sent one of their youngest sons, Ron, to squire for Lord Potter. They were not a wealthy house, but they were renowned for their loyalty and honesty. Who knew what today's visit might bring?  ""House Malfoy,"" Ser Hagrid announced. His tone was pleasant, but he never took his eyes off of the crowd entering the room, and kept his thumb tucked into his belt just inches away from the hilt of his sword. Even Maester Dumbledore clutched his walking stick closely, ready for any trouble.   ""Careful of them, Lord Potter,"" the Maester whispered into his ear. ""The Malfoys have always coveted House Potter's lands, and there are rumors that they secretly supported the shadowbinder that killed your parents. That they even sought to put him on the Iron Throne!""  A young man entered the hall, followed by a trail of armored knights. He had the silvery white hair and pale skin of the Targaryens, and the pinched face of a rodent. Each member of his retinue carried a green banner marked with a black Dragon over a set of crossed spears.   ""You must be the new Potter,"" the new arrival said. He approached the table with a confident swagger and sized up the new Lord. He sneered at Harry, and there was a tense, awkward silence. ""I'm Draco, of House Malfoy. But you knew that already.""   With a sudden twirl, Draco pulled a dagger from his belt and lunged at Harry. Every knight in the room drew their blade, but Draco was not attacking: he plunged the dagger into an apple from Harry's plate and took a bite of the crisp fruit. The wet crunch resounded through the hall just as the men were about to start slitting each other's throats. Ser Hagrid's own sword, heavier than some of the wooden beams in the roof, was aimed straight at Draco's neck.   ""Not bad,"" Draco said, chewing the apple and sizing up Harry's reaction. Harry wasn't sure which one the statement referred to. ""Be seeing you around, Potter."""

Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,Big02001,24,Wed Jun 17 16:03:18 2015 UTC,I really need to find a good way to decide which stories I will continue.
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,Big02001,15,Wed Jun 17 17:08:11 2015 UTC,You could attach a straw pole at the bottom of any you would be interested in continuing? Then whatever gets the most feedback you continue?
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,TechieDad,11,Wed Jun 17 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"On almost every writing prompt I see you answer, I see at least one request for you to continue.  And I usually agree, I'd love to read more.  However, I love to see the new prompts as well.  Maybe a poll to see which ones generate the most interest?  I guess upvoting provides a rough estimate on that.  Two thoughts, for stories that people want to read more of, but you don't have the time or interest to continue.  First is, ""Always leave them wanting more.""  You close at a point where interest is still high, and every detail hasn't been explored to death.  Sometimes, that's the perfect place to stop.  A second thought is to have some of your short stories become writing prompts for others.  Let someone else continue the story.  That way people can read more, but your time is conserved to the areas that interest you most."

Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,Imnotveryfunatpartys,10,Thu Jun 18 12:05:26 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. But as a HP fan I can't really believe this because it is much more likely that they would simply confund the draft people and get their names wiped from the list. The ministry would probably get all the wizard names wiped, actually.  But given the prompt I like what you did with it."
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,Deprisonne,7,Wed Jun 17 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe the army found a way to ""convince"" the ministery to spare a few wizards to help speed the invasion along."
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,snowman1092,6,Wed Jun 17 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"I mean I'd say that if the Prime Minister of Wizard Germany revealed himself to Hitler, like the British Ministers do, Hitler would looove to get his hands on a squad of Wizards. That would convince the Ministry of Magic to send some wizards into it.   Although, while WWII was going on, Grindlewald was at the height of his power. I'd say perhaps he had something to do with the war, maybe Imperious a young German Chancellor?"
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,Gerrendus,4,Thu Jun 18 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"I believe Rowling has said the war with Grindelwald paralleled WW2. In which case the Wizards were likely busy with their own war. That being said it's an interesting premise, and I think it's highly conceivable that there would be some muggleborns who would feel it was their duty to answer the draft."

Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,londongarbageman,2,Wed Jun 17 18:43:02 2015 UTC,Another interesting avenue would be to tell about France's magical community's response to WW2. How does Beauxbatons fare amid the turmoil? Were there any wizards in the Resistance or Vichy?
Luna_Lovewell,3a6b9a,matig123,2,Wed Jun 17 20:24:53 2015 UTC,Is there anyway to form like a poll of which stories you should continue? Maybe a link from your sub to some poll site? This is one that I'd love to see continued!

I'd like to see this a longer short story, maybe even something more like a novella. Seriously, Idk if you have enough love for this story to straight up write a book, but ten or twenty pages would awesome. You could even break from the prompt a bit, just to give yourself more wiggle room for story (other civilizations who surrendered without being utterly destroyed, cities made up of early conscientious objectors and/or defectors to the robot side, even Amish who have left for rumspringa and didn't go back, ect.).  Anyway, a philosophical debate between a well meaning robot and a fearful Amish young man could be really goddamn interesting!! Especially if you researched into the Amish life so you can further enrich the story."

Luna_Lovewell,3a2sfh,Blythist,3,Wed Jun 17 04:35:28 2015 UTC,wouldn't 'sites' technically work in this case? seems like it might but I'm not entirely sure.
Luna_Lovewell,3a2sfh,dragonbud20,2,Wed Jun 17 05:33:22 2015 UTC,"It would, but ""seeing the sights"" is the commonly used term. ""Sights"" would also be a more general term, and as she isn't referring to any specific or prementioned sites it would probably make slightly more sense.  Either works, in any case. It was more glaring for me how the boy changed his name to Derrick for a brief moment there. Probably just space-time acting up again though."

Luna_Lovewell,3a2sfh,Slagggg,8,Wed Jun 17 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I didn't think this story came out very well.  The more I wrote it, the more I had trouble with the universe. For example, with the ""Sioux."" She went back and met them and they hadn't been exposed to Europeans yet. But had none of the Loopers ever said ""Hey, there's this other continent and they're going to come give you a bunch of diseases someday.""?  Or, worse: ""Hey, there's this other continent and they're going to come give you a bunch of diseases someday, so here is all of the technology you need to make guns and steam engines so that you can beat the tar out of them when they arrive.""  And, following that logic, someone could conceivably give technology to cavemen or something. There would be no history or logical progression of technological development. If they could change history on their loops, then how has that not already happened? And if they can't change history, then there couldn't be this new disease because no one could ever bring it back via loop.  The more I thought about everything, the less sense it made. As is often the case with time travel paradoxes. I suppose I could have rewritten it to change things, like maybe that Loopers are just observers (can't touch anything, can't speak, etc.) or maybe they go back and live in someone else's mind for a day and can't change what that person does but sees history from their eyes. But by the time I had thought about those I had already written the story.  Tl;dr: I didn't like this story as much as others."
Luna_Lovewell,3a2sfh,Slagggg,3,Wed Jun 17 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"The looper's disease is the first instance of a timeline side effect. Previously any timeline impact was eliminated on return.

Luna_Lovewell,3a2sfh,Roadcrosser,2,Wed Jun 17 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured the Looper's Disease could only be caught while in a loop.  Although, if looping has always happened, why hasn't anyone known about it until now?"

Luna_Lovewell,3a1l2o,Luna_LoveWell,91,Tue Jun 16 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"Drums rumbled from inside Château de Caen. Trumpets soon joined the caucophony as riders blaring their instruments joined up and returned to the fortress, leading a mob of Moros from the countryside. Most of the nearby city had already been burned to the ground, and the tawny stone walls were marked with soot. The dead clawed at the rocks until their nails bled, not red but a thick, congealed black ooze. King Stephen watched them from the battlements, masking his face to avoid the horrendous smell that would soon be worse.  Workers splashed oil on the closest of the horde and used slings to launch oil-soaked rags into the midst of the rest of them. Stephen notched an arrow on his bow and set it alight, carefully avoiding any spilled drops. Flames danced as he lit the arrow and sent it flying.   The fires spread rapidly through the crowd. Stephen and some of the men stayed on the ramparts, sweating profusely in their steel armor to ensure that none found a way to scale the barrier. The Moros continued clawing at the wall even as the flesh shriveled away from their bones, as if they didn't even notice the fires. As quickly as the closest ones fell to pieces, their comrades climbed over their bones trying to scale the wall. The men stood in the courtyard in eerie silence, listening only to the crackle of flames and the low moan of the undead. It was somehow worse than the cries and screams and clanging of a normal battle.   This was the sixth time they had been able to effectively use such tactics. Each day, the supply of Moros in the countryside had magically replenished. Something was drawing them to the coast. Perhaps the noise. Or the smell of the fire. Or maybe they could just sense living men. Whatever it was, they showed no signs of stopping anytime soon.  A scream shattered the silence. Across the wall, a man's arms windmilled wildly before toppling over the side into the mass of undead. Comrades rushed to the area and began stabbing over the wall with their pikes. Stephen watched as a skeletal hand grabbed onto the handle of the long weapon and used it to hoist himself up onto the wall, still aflame. Behind it, two more were able to scale the battlements climbing a ramp of burning corpses.   Knights rushed forward with their swords as more and more of the undead managed to make it over the wall. Their steel armor left them invulnerable to bites, but they were hardly strong enough to contain the strength of the mob. Sunlight glinted off the armor of one as he was toppled over the side, back into the courtyard, by the force of the swelling crowd atop the wall. Knights beheaded them as quickly as possible but for every one neck severed, two more took its place.   ""BACK!"" Stephen shouted to them as servants hastily piled coal underneath the rampart. The knights retreated, just in time: the wooden frame butting up against the wall went up in flames, and the mass of zombies coming over the wall fell into the coal pits on the other side. From there, it was a simple matter of containing them until they burned under the weight of the other Moros.  The onslaught ended more than 9 hours after it started. The men were exhausted, dehydrated, disgusted, and disheartened. The ashes outside the gates had been piled so high that the castle was no longer safe. It would take days to shovel it all away, and another assault would be the death of them.  ""Come,"" Stephen announced, signalling to load up the caravan, ""On to the next castle!"""

Luna_Lovewell,3a1l2o,evilcream,3,Wed Jun 17 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really.  At this point in history the Byzantine Empire was a pale shadow of its former glory.  While two major blows had yet to arrive, the Battle of Manzikert and the 4th Crusade, the Byzantines had been continously losing ground in Anatolia to the advancing Turks.  However, to your point they still would have an army and would be potentially safe behind Constantinople's Long Walls.  OOH  /u/Luna_LoveWell if you keep going with this one, do a section on how the Byzantines are still holding Constantinople, and Stephen hears about this and goes to meet up with them.

One thing though, with the self-driving technology, wouldn't the protagonist's car respond to the Toyota that it was in manual mode? Or perhaps that would be restricted as a privacy thing....

Luna_Lovewell,3a2txj,David_Crockett,9,Tue Jun 16 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm an awful editor.   wouldn't the protagonist's car respond to the Toyota that it was in manual mode?    The way I though of it, the car has to ask if it can do anything when it is in manual mode. It can't just take control for him, and it can't just tell the other car what's happening. Maybe some people like it for the privacy stuff."

Luna_Lovewell,3a2txj,ramsey17,2,Tue Jun 16 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"He did it because he disagreed with the logic used by the computers/robots in determining the correct course of action. Det. Spooner (Will Smith) was involved in an Auto Vs. Auto accident then sent both vehicles into a cold river. A passing robot did the math and decided that Spooner was more likely to survive a rescue attempt (it only had time to save one person) and so pulled him out of the sinking car. Spooner watched a 12 year old girl drown while he was pulled to safety. He contends that any human being would know to save the girl first.    Or... to give the quote from IMDB...    Susan Calvin: What happened to you? Detective Del Spooner: Headed back to the station. Normal day, normal life. The driver of a semi fell asleep at the wheel. Average guy, wife and kids, working a double. Not the devil. The car he hit, the driver's name was Harold Lloyd. Like the film star, but no relation. He was killed instantly. But his twelve-year-old was sitting in the passenger's seat. Never really met her. Can't forget her face, though. Sarah. [fingering the necklace] Detective Del Spooner: This was hers. She wanted to be a dentist. What the hell kind of twelve-year-old wants to be a dentist? Yeah, um... the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river. You know, metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds. She's pinned, I'm pinned, the water's coming in. I'm a cop, so I know everybody's dead. Just a few minutes until we figure that out. NS4 was passing by and jumped in the river. NS4 Robots: [from flashback] You are in danger! Detective Del Spooner: [from flashback] Save her! NS4 Robots: [from flashback] You are in danger! Detective Del Spooner: [from flashback] Save her! Save the girl! Detective Del Spooner: But it didn't. Saved me. Susan Calvin: The robot's brain is a difference engine. It's reading vital signs. It must have done... Detective Del Spooner: It did. I was the logical choice. It calculated that I had a 45% chance of survival. Sarah only had an 11% chance. That was somebody's baby. 11% is more than enough. A human being would've known that. Robots, [indicating his heart] Detective Del Spooner: nothing here, just lights and clockwork. Go ahead, you trust 'em if you want to."

The idea is that the main character is abandoned somewhere without people, shipwrech, empty spaceship, etc. In their experience odd things happen to them that are completely inexplicable that make them come to the realization that they are loosing their mind. But the reality is that they are not actually alone  and the inexplicable events are nothing more than the actions of those around them that they cannot perceive."

If a glass of water moves the author can simply omit any description of a person moving it. In a movie you would have to cut scenes back and forth showing changes.

Luna_Lovewell,39g7f1,peterpacz1,3,Thu Jun 11 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"The Zombie apocalypse... but in China. Modern China. We often see portrayals of the zombie apocalypse in western society - mostly from a U.S perspective, with perhaps a few offhand remarks about some other European countries. I would love to see a story written about the zombie apocalypse in China.  This would be very interesting, as China has not only an authoritarian government, but also the world's largest military force. If this apocalypse starts in the U.S (as it is stereotypical), it would take a good month or two for the infection to hit the People's Republic, and by than the government would most likely have mobilized.  In particular, because the government is centralized, the state should be able to react to the apocalypse slightly faster than most western nations, and it would be interesting to see how the economy and society in general copes with this. The People's Liberation Army would have to probably have to block off the borders between India and Pakistan, as that is where the majority of the refugees/zombie hoard would arrive, while the PLA navy would be hard at work protecting the major cities near the chinese coast.  Overall, it would be very refreshing to see a portrayal of the classical zombie apocalypse from the perspective of an authoritarian government rather than your typical rag-tag bunch of survivors after society has fallen. We always assume that the zombie apocalypse will be the end of society, but society is usually far more resistant than that."

Luna_Lovewell,39g7f1,NuclearStudent,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Rogue planet:       A rogue planet, also known as an interstellar planet, nomad planet, free-floating planet or orphan planet, is a planetary-mass object that orbits the galaxy directly. They have either been ejected from the planetary system in which they formed or have never been gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf.    There may be billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way.   Some planetary-mass objects are thought to have formed in a similar way to stars, and the IAU has proposed that those objects be called sub-brown dwarfs  (an example of this is Cha 110913-773444, which may be an ejected rogue planet or may have formed on its own and be a sub-brown dwarf).  The closest free-floating planetary mass object to Earth yet discovered, WISE 0855−0714, is around 7 light years away.  Recent observations of a very young free-floating planetary mass object with the Herschel Space Observatory and the Very Large Telescope demonstrate that the processes that characterize the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. Herschel far-infrared observations show that the young free-floating planetary mass object OTS 44 is surrounded by a disk with a mass of at least 10 Earth masses and can, therefore, eventually form a mini planetary system.  Spectroscopic observations of OTS 44 with the SINFONI spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope reveal that the disk is actively accreting matter similar to young stars.

""Your Majesty, I cannot in good conscience allow you to face this impudent commoner. Especially given your advanced a...""   The Minister of Defence trailed off and tried to mask his mistake as a cough as soon as the queen tore her gaze away from the window and glared at him.  ""My advanced what?"" she said. Her saccharine sweet tone was like an old granny handing out cookies, but her steely gaze revealed her true state of mind. ""Go on,"" she urged, ""Say it. My age.""  He cleared his throat and took a step back, stumbling a bit on the priceless Persian carpets underfoot. ""That's not..."" he stammered, ""I wasn't suggesting that...""   The Queen turned back to the window, already bored with the conversation.   ""And how will it look if I refuse?"" she said. The Minister wasn't sure if she was addressing him, or talking to herself. ""The dignity and responsibility of the monarchy has been steadily chipped away since the War; there's hardly anything left. And you expect me to shy away from the few obligations we have left?""  The Queen's solicitor chimed in at this point. ""I am not sure it is a requirement, Your Grace. My team and I would need time to study this so-called proclamation. I mean, it's been centuries since someone dueled a reigning king..."" Elizabeth whirled to glare at him with fire in her eyes, ""...or queen"" he continued hastily. ""And it would give us time to explore our other options. Perhaps you could name a champion to fight on your behalf, or challenge his nobility status. I mean, purchased from the internet?"" He sniffed and adjusted his collar. Elizabeth was too busy watching the commotion at the gates to remind the solicitor that he had only been knighted in gratitude for certain issues that he had... smoothed over in the courts for Prince Harry.   ""What is his name?"" she asked.  The Minister of Defence and the solicitor exchanged looks. ""Roger,' the solicitor finally answered. ""I believe. I don't know his surname, but I don't think it matters very much.""   The Queen didn't answer. The Minister of Defence inched slowly toward the door, just waiting to be excused.  ""We'll need to learn his last name,"" she said finally, turning from the window and gingerly stepping from her stool. A white-gloved servant whisked it away in the blink of an eye, barely pausing to polish the marble floor. ""The announcer will need to know the challenger's name.""  The Minister of Defence's jaw actually dropped open like a cartoon character. ""You... you actually mean to fight him?"" he asked.   The solicitor chimed in, too: ""Reconsider this, Your Majesty. Let's not make any decisions in haste!""  She walked past them both without so much as a glance, striding through the doorway and down the hall with the vigor of a woman half her age. They exchanged a look, and hurried after her.  ""You think I'm a coward, weighing my options and trying to squirm out of a fight? I made the decision as soon as I was informed of the challenge,"" she responded. ""I've just been waiting for the stables to prepare my horse.""  The solicitor stopped in his tracks while she continued onward. She passed a full suit of armor stamped with the Tudor crest, a priceless relic of English history. Then she ripped the lance from its steel grip and hefted the weapon's weight with a gentle toss in the air as though it was as light as a toothpick.  ""That should do the trick,"" the solicitor heard her mutter as she turned a corner in the direction of the stables.

Or a thumb lock, it tends to be exposed.  Being of European descent (and actually originally being interested in European swords), I've often wanted to learn those arts. How'd you get started in it?

Luna_Lovewell,395xaw,RyGuy997,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"My main martial arts are Olympic Fencing, catch wrestling and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  It depends on where you are based. Where I live, it is exceedingly difficult to find a group. I was rather lucky, my fencing instructor also teaches European Martial arts and I train with him when I get the chance. It's relatively inexpensive for me, because we're generally good at finding materials and making our own weapons, or repurposing those of Kendo or any other sword style that happens to be available. It's quite amusing, we duct taped cross guards onto shinai to make some cheap wasters. The difficult part with European Martial Arts is that not all groups train to be combat effective, quite often they're just studying the style academically and LARPing. You could probably try and get a hold of a manual from somewhere like Wiktenauer and assemble your own group.  Also, by my definition, an arm bar generally has a straight arm. The English term for an ude-garami is usually a key hold or figure four. It's interesting that you use the wrist lock, though. Could you please elaborate?

Luna_Lovewell,383aiy,Luna_LoveWell,392,Mon Jun 1 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"""OK, Genie,"" I called out, rubbing the lamp just as I'd done the first time. Nothing happened. Probably still offended that his previous 'catch' wasn't as bad as he thought.  ""I know you have to come out,"" I said right into the spout. ""I'm ready for my second wish!""  Smoke billowed around me, and the Genie once again appeared on the beach. His lips were pursed and he refused to look me in the eye. Hard to believe that a thousand-year-old genie was less mature than a five-year-old child.   ""Well?"" he said. He tapped his foot against the sand, causing the little bells on his slippers to jingle.  ""Still mad about the first wish?"" I asked, offering him a sip of my mai tai.  ""Just get to the second one,"" he said with a huff.  ""Fine."" I couldn't control my smug smile; he was being so ridiculous. ""For my second wish, I never want to age. I want to stay 25 forever.""  The Genie nodded, clearly trying to think of some way to make that backfire on me.  ""Better make it good,"" I taunted him. ""Wouldn't want me to have to pay taxes or something!""  ""Shut up!"" he told me. ""I'm trying to think.""  After a momentary pause, he grinned maliciously and nodded. ""Ok, wish granted!"" he said.  I looked myself up and down. Exactly the same. We were off to a good start, at least. I took a careful step around. No problems walking, internal organs weren't failing...  ""So what's the catch?"" I ask. ""How many centuries of being 25 do I have to wait before I learn what it is?""  ""Oh, you'll learn soon enough,"" he responded with an expression like a dog eying a big steak. ""Soon enough!"" he repeated with that same supervillain laugh he'd used when he told me I had to pay taxes.    I threw a big party that night. My private jet brought all of my friends from the States down to my Caribbean mansion. Booze was flowing, music was blasting, lampshades on heads, people jumping into the pools with their clothes on... best bash I ever threw. The only thing wrong with the entire evening was the Genie. Every time I would talk to someone, he'd cackle and howl like a raving lunatic. Like someone was tickling him mercilessly. None of the guests could hear him, but I couldn't shut him up. And he wouldn't stay in his bottle, either.  ""Ok, what is it?"" I asked when I finally found an empty room. He was gloating like a seven year old with a secret. ""Is the consequence here that you're just going to annoy me while I remain 25?""  ""Oh, no!"" he said with mock sympathy. ""You haven't realized it yet?"" I didn't think his grin could get any wider than his entire face, but I forgot that he had his supernatural powers.   ""Just tell me,"" I said with an exaggerated eye roll.  ""Fine,"" he said. He waved his hands and conjured a picture of my friend Melissa.  ""Notice anything different about her?"" The genie asked coyly.  I studied the picture. Exactly the same as when I'd left the room a minute ago. Not bad, either: she was looking amazing tonight. Enough to make me question the 'friend' status. ""Not particularly..."" I said.  ""She doesn't look a bit... younger... than the last time you saw her?""  I took another look. ""Not really,"" I answered.   ""She's 25 now, too!"" The genie howled like Dr. Doom explaining his master plan. ""Not 26! And the same for everyone else you know! They're all now 25 years old!""  I stifled a laugh. ""Everyone?""  ""Oh yes,"" the genie said. ""Every single person you've ever met. You thought you'd be the only one. You wanted to be young and healthy while everyone else got old around you, didn't you? You wanted to be the best! Well not anymore, pal! Now you're nothing special! Even your parents will remain 25!""  ""So you just took what I wanted, and gave it to everyone else?""  ""Oh yeah,"" the genie crowed. ""Bet you regret making fun of my tax curse now, don't you?""  ""So everyone I love will continue to be youthful and healthy with me,"" I asked.  ""Ye... yeah,"" the Genie stammered, getting his first inkling that something was wrong.  I couldn't hold back the smile anymore. ""And this is instead of getting old and dying, leaving me all alone, right?""  The genie looked up at the ceiling like he was doing complex equations in his head.  ""Fuck,"" he muttered angrily before turning back into a pillar of smoke and disappearing into his bottle.    Here is Wish #3!"
Luna_Lovewell,383aiy,gathmoon,451,Mon Jun 1 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"He took it really hard. I almost felt bad for teasing him.   ""I've just never been good at this,"" he told me as he blew his nose into my satin handkerchief. We were stretched out on the balcony overlooking the bay, and he'd been droning on about how low self esteem for at least an hour. At least I'd finally managed to coax him out of his bottle. ""Dad always told me that I'd be a failure, and he was right. All of the other genies are so damn clever and can just think up all these good twists for wishes, right there on the spot. Even when we were all kids growing up together, training to later become genies, they all made fun of me for being slow. And now look at me. You've already gotten two wishes and not only are you still alive, but you're happy!""  I was a bit offended that he wanted me dead so much, but this wasn't really the time to bring it up.   ""I try and try to come up with clever twists, and they're always awful."" He turned to me suddenly, sloshing the mimosa in his hand that he'd barely even touched. ""Did I tell you about my last master? He was a bit like you. He wished to be the richest man in the world, and the catch that I came up with for him was that he would then lose all of it. And now look at him: giving it all away and earning the reputation of 'the world's best philanthropist'! Doesn't he realize how hurtful that is?"" The genie took a sip of his drink. ""Stupid Bill Gates,"" he muttered. ""He got everything! Money, power, the woman of his dreams, the adoration of the public... I just couldn't win!""  ""Don't be so hard on yourself,"" I told him. ""Who cares what the other genies think? Hell, I like you a lot better because your twists aren't devastating!""  He rolled his eyes. ""Well of course you do!"" He took another swig of his drink. ""I just don't know if I'm cut out for this.""  We stared out at the water in silence. What more did I need, really? My investments were doing so well that I was on pace to make another few billion this year, so I'd never really need any more money. And having money gave me fame and power. And I had health and eternal life, as did all of my friends and family.  ""Then don't do it anymore,"" I finally answered him.  He almost fell off of his chair. ""You're not saying...""  I nodded. ""For my last wish, I want you to be free.""   Tears welled up in his eyes. I didn't know genies could cry. ""You mean it?"" he stammered.   I nodded. ""Absolutely. As a thank you, for not putting in malicious conditions in my wishes.""  He sobbed and hugged me. ""Your wish is my command.""    Genie woke me up at 6 AM for the four thousandth time in a row. ""What are we doing today, man? Want to go skydiving again? Maybe a jet ski race?"" He was like a hyperactive child that had just discovered coffee.  After I set him free, he realized that he didn't really have anywhere else to go. No passport, social security number, no skills or education to actually earn a living, and worst of all: no more powers. So, he'd stayed here with me. Clinging to my heels everywhere I went. Hitting on all of my friends with the coy and subtle moves of a 10 year old trying to see his first pair of breasts. Throwing temper tantrums any time someone didn't find his particularly juvenile brand of humor entertaining. Attendance at my parties had slowly and steadily dwindled ever since, with some of my best friends making excuses for how they were 'too busy' to be flown down to the Bahamas to try out my new submarine.   I gritted my teeth and pulled the blankets over my head. Maybe if I just ignore him he'll go away, I told myself in a barely-awake haze. It hadn't worked the last 3999 times, but who knows?   Surprise: Genie didn't get the hint. He ripped open the curtains, flooding the room with piercing sunlight. ""Just look at that dawn!"" he said. ""You don't truly realize how beautiful it is until you spend a thousand years in a bottle with no light or fresh air.""   Ah, the old ""I was enslaved for a millennium, and also you owe everything to me."" The same excuse he used any time I tried to talk to him about his behavior, like it was a ""get out of jail free"" card that he could use over and over again.   He pulled the covers off of my bed, leaving me exposed. ""And to think,"" he continued. ""I never would have gotten to experience all of this if you hadn't freed me!"" He leaned in close enough for me to smell his putrid morning breath. He'd never needed personal hygiene when he was a supernatural being, and he hadn't been too keen on adopting the new habits. ""I'm just glad that I was so bad at thinking up consequences for wishes!""  I grimaced and rolled over. You have no idea how good at it you really are.

Luna_Lovewell,37cd7o,Luna_LoveWell,100,Tue May 26 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"""And what year were you born?"" Doctor Hamlin asked.  ""1896,"" I responded calmly without even needing to count backwards from 1922.   ""Where were you when the Titanic sank?"" he asked, scribbling something on his pad of paper.  ""I was in San Francisco when I heard the news. I was working on the docks.""  ""Mmmhmmm,"" the Doctor answered. They probably didn't have the resources to find out who I really was, especially in this pre-internet age. I could make up whatever I wanted.  ""So you were 18 during the election of 1912, correct?""  I did quick math in my head. ""Yes, I had just turned 18.""  ""And who ran against President Wilson in that election?""  I ground my teeth together. I had always hated history class. How the fuck was I supposed to remember some presidential candidate from a hundred years ago??  ""It was...."" The doctor's hand hovered over the buzzer, eager to dole out punishment. ""Taft."" I finally answered. I knew he was from this time, and had been President at one point. It was a good guess, at least.  Electricity flooded through my veins, burning me from the inside out. My legs twitched and I dug my nails into the grooves on the chair's arm where a hundred other patients had left their marks during electroshock therapy. I tried to hold it back, but a primal scream erupted from my chest. ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?!""   The electricity cut off suddenly, and I slumped back down into the seat. The doctor's hand didn't stray far from the button, though. Always read to dish out more.  ""You know what happens when you make up lies,"" the Doctor said. ""As soon as you manage to shed this false skin that you've put on, pretending to be some 'time traveler' out of a Jules Verne novel, then we can proceed amicably. Do you understand?""   I stared sullenly at a crack in the white plaster wall. I'd tried telling the truth, for about a month. I didn't know how I got here. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't making things up. I really had been sucked out of 2015 somehow. They didn't believe me. So then I tried to lie. They were right. I was just making up stories for attention, and I was willing to admit it now. I told them all about my life in the early 1900s.... and they still shocked me. Fucking bastards.  ""I said, do you understand?"" The Doctor asked.  I didn't answer, and he shocked me again with a sadistic grin on his face.    I returned to the common room shortly after my session, legs still jittering from the shock treatment. Benny, the man who'd first introduced me to this little community that night three months ago, was playing cards with Tiberius and Matthews (A Roman legionnaire and American Revolutionary soldier, respectively). Benny gestured over for me to join, but I strode straight past him to the very corner.  The Inventor was taking up an entire table for himself, scattered with all sorts of diagrams and equations and notes. I knocked them all aside  and grabbed him by the collar.  ""Tell me how you did it,"" I shouted into his face, spraying spittle onto his glasses. ""Tell me about the machine and how you pulled us back. And tell me what you need to make another.""  He just stared back at me with the same sad expression he always wore. He didn't even struggle; just went completely limp as I shook him back and forth.   ""Tell me!""   He shook his head slowly and looked down, almost crying.  I threw him back into his seat and scooped up all his papers. ""I'm taking these,"" I told him. He stood up like he was about to fight back, but he saw the fire in my eyes and promptly sat right back down.   I carried his notes back to me own table and spread them out. I took high school physics; what could some guy in the twenties know that I couldn't figure out?  I couldn't spend another day in this place, and this machine was the only way home.    Here's the 3rd part!"
Luna_Lovewell,37cd7o,_beast__,66,Tue May 26 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"An attendant came by and checked my straps once more, giving them a good solid tug and rattling the bars just to bother me. He did the same to a few of my neighbors, then I heard his footsteps cross the room and the door slammed shut. I rested my head on the pillow, counting backwards from a hundred and fighting my instinct to struggle against the constraints. Even after months in the institution, it still irked me to be tied down.  38.... 37... 36...  Chains across the room tinkled softly. Finally.  Benny's grinning face appeared over my bed and quickly loosened the restraints.  ""Someday you're going to have to tell me how to get out of these,"" I whispered as I rubbed my chafed wrists. Benny just laughed and moved on to the next bed.   When we were all loose, we each pulled the parts of the machine from their various hiding places. It's amazing what you can get away with when the attendants don't have security cameras or things like that. It also helps that they didn't give two shits about their jobs and only really paid attention to us when it came to dishing out punishment. As long as we were back in our beds by morning, they'd never suspect a thing.   Getting the components was an entirely different matter. None of us knew anyone on the outside, really. My great-grandfather was probably out there somewhere, but I didn't exactly have his number. The institution itself was not particularly well-stocked with advanced (for the 1920s) technological components. We'd had to get creative. Stealing from the doctors at the risk of severe beatings and additional ""treatment"" with scarring electroshock therapy. Smuggling in pieces procured by some neighborhood kids who played near the fence, paid for with whatever funds we could steal from the staff. Most of the time we had to improvise; the whole machine was stuck together with bits of chewing gum and wire unraveled from the mesh screens of the windows.   ""We need to get this little thingy here,"" I told Benny and the others, pointing to the sketch in the notebook. This had all been harder than I thought; everything had been done with all of these weird tools and gadgets that were long obsolete by the time I was even born. I didn't even recognize most of them. The one we currently needed was a weird tangle of wires and balls and plates. We both stared down at the paper, squinting in the moonlight as we tried to guess what it did. The Inventor had been kind enough to scribble ""important!"" next to the picture, but no explanation of what it was.   ""Differential Analyzer,"" a voice chimed in from the very far corner of the room. Benny and I froze immediately: a guard? No, it hadn't come from the door: it had come from one of the beds. The one in the very back: the Inventor.  ""It solves differential equations. And I know where we can get one""   Benny looked at me, then back to the dark corner.  ""You can talk?"" Benny hissed, clearly wanting to shout but not wanting to alert the guards. ""When the hell did that start??""  The Inventor was silent for a moment. ""Let me go,"" he said, rattling his restraints for effect, ""And I'll finish the machine for you.""  Benny shrugged and scampered across the room to free him. The inventor nodded quickly in thanks and stood uncertainly near his bed like he was waiting for an invitation to come over. Everyone just stared, waiting for him to come to us until finally I waved him over impatiently. He walked toward the worktable, still hiding a bit in the shadows and afraid to come too close to the group. I picked up the blueprints and moved closer to him instead, pointing at the component. ""How do we get one?"" I asked.  ""I can make a call,"" he whispered, so quiet that I could barely hear him from a foot away. ""I still know people on the outside.""  Benny clapped him on the back with a huge grin. ""We'll have this thingamajig done in no time! Happy to have you on board, Inventor!"" The others cheered softly in agreement, gathering around the Inventor and asking him all the questions they had had about the machine. He tried to answer them one at a time, adjusting his glasses nervously. But for the first time in the months I'd been here, I saw him genuinely smile.    Here's part 4!"
Luna_Lovewell,37cd7o,Fenrizwolf,96,Wed May 27 02:21:11 2015 UTC,"We clustered around the table as the Inventor gingerly connected the wiring. He'd warned us that this was a delicate operation, so we were afraid to even breathe. Tiberius, always the superstitious one, was clutching the eagle idol that he'd carved out of soap, a reminder of his old legionnaire standard. ""Just a bit more,"" the Inventor whispered as he carefully soldered a few remaining pieces together. ""Done!"" he announced, quiet as a churchmouse but louder than I'd ever heard him speak.  There it was. Three feet tall, looking like a sort of frankenstein jukebox. But the Inventor assured us that it would work. He'd figured out what the problem was in the first machine that he'd used to bring us back, and we'd worked on the equations together. Once we got to know each other, it turned out that he was a pretty good teacher and my high school physics came in handy after all. He was also excited to hear all about Einstein and E = MC2 and all that; I may have accidentally changed history there, but if it got me home then it would all be worth it.   ""So...."" Benny said, drumming his knuckles on the table. ""Who are we sending back first?""  Everyone looked around a bit sheepishly. Of course we all wanted to go first, but no one was going to say it. And so, as always, everyone turned to me to make the decision.   ""Get in there Benny,"" I said with a smile and an eye roll. He danced forward with a delighted jig, ready to get back to the 1840s and see his wife and child. I'd told him all about penicillin and all sorts of other advancements that would make things a bit better for him, and might just make him rich. I also told him that he might want to avoid the Mason-Dixon line starting around 1860.   He stood in front of the table, fidgeting nervously. ""Do I need to do anything?"" he asked. The Inventor just shook his head; even after he'd started speaking, he remained a man of few words.   ""Here goes nothing,"" the Inventor said. He raised one gloved hand and pressed a button in the center of the machine.   There was a sudden buzzing from within the machine, not unlike a hive of angry bees. Then a flash of sparks and a small curling tendril of smoke. Benny's smile evaporated like he'd dropped it on the floor as he realized what happened:  The machine didn't work.    ""Yes, short the market,"" I ordered into the phone, leaning back in my chair and looking down Hanover Street from my corner office. ""Everything."" I took a sip of the fine bourbon in my glass and raised a silent toast to Benny sitting across from my. ""And while we're at it, sell all of our German holdings and divest from the Mark."" I hung up the phone after ensuring that everything was finalized.   After the failure of the machine, we refocused our efforts. Escape was a simple matter, and since we were all quite sane, it wasn't particularly hard to avoid being captured. We had no families or friends to go back to in this time period, so they had no leads to track down. We hid in plain sight: New York City. And best of all, the group had me. I was no historian, but I knew enough to know about the ""roaring twenties."" Our smuggling operation ran booze down from Canada like a waterfall to supply our chain of pharmacies that filled many prescriptions for man's favorite intoxicant. A little trick I learned from the Kennedies, and it made us as rich as it did for them back in my timeline. With that, I was free to do what I want with our money.   Benny was enjoying the high life. He was the only one who had stayed in the U.S. with me as we transitioned to a big Wall Street investment firm. The others had all gone over to Britain with the Inventor, who was eager to get to work on this ""radar"" invention and some other tools that might come in handy in the next few years. Tiberius had become quite the high society gentleman over there, and befriended a nice young man named Winston. Lot of potential in that one; Tiberius was encouraging him to go into politics as soon as he got out of the military.   ""So what do you call it?"" Benny asked. I cocked my head inquisitively. ""That disaster tomorrow?""  ""Ah,"" I said. ""The reason we're shorting the stock market. It's 'Black Friday.' A big selloff. We're betting against the market, and we'll make a fortune.""  Benny nodded. ""Seems a bit unfair, using your knowledge of the future."" He took a sip. ""Or the past, for you."" He had trouble with this whole past/future tense thing too.  I took a sip of my drink. ""Pulling me a hundred years back in time was unfair. I'm just evening the score with the universe.""    The end! I hope you enjoyed the story!

Luna_Lovewell,37cd7o,Nathanmcd4122,7,Wed May 27 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool.  Though Winston Churchill was pretty famous even in the first world war and comanded the British fleet (well he was ""high lord of the admirality"" from 1911 on which is more of a political position)... so young unknown man doesnt quite fit there. By the way read up on that guy because he is an amazing character with a life that defies belief so hes great fodder for writers.  Also the wallstreet crash was in 1929 (not black friday but black monday and tuesday) where Churchill was super active in politics (Primeminister only 10 years later)  Still a great story :)"

You wouldn't believe how often it is possible to access a vault due to something the architect did think of.    Reminded me of the time my father was installing a music system (for Muzak) into a bank.  He put the dish up on the roof, and was running lines through the ducts.    Scared the heck out of the bank guards when he walked out of the vault.    They made him show how he got in and when he had to go back after a couple days, they had cut a line where they put in a cement block in the way.    So he drilled a tiny hole through the cement to rerun the line."

Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Luna_LoveWell,263,Thu May 21 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"Flashing red and blue lights illuminated the normally quiet street, and I watched the officers shove Gina's husband into the back of the cruiser. He snarled like a vicious beast and raged about how he'd get back at all of them. I had the feeling that he was overinflating the importance of his position on the city council, which he was going to lose as soon as this all came to light. Funny how often fixing one person's life ruins another, isn't it? Not my concern, though.  She was watching from the screened-in porch, cradling little Jacob in her arms. I'd seen shows like COPS, where domestic violence victims would suddenly change their mind and try to protest the arrest. Not Gina. She looked... victorious. She wasn't aware whose victory it really was, but I had no need for credit or adulation. Even from a distance, her body language indicated determination and independence. She didn't need him any more, and that meant she didn't need me anymore. Another successful run.  It had started out as a simple game for me. I just wanted to see how much I could change a person's life. I wanted their entire fate wrapped around my finger. I could make them dance like a marionette. Most of my kind only used this power for their own ends (money, power... the usual), but I had no interest in that either. For me, it was all about control. And I might as well do something to help them with that power, right?  The police cars pulled away with the thug in the back, and I returned home. I disposed of Gina's folder, a ritual that had become more and more common for me as I perfected my talents. My first case had taken years to perfect; I had changed Gina's life in only seven months. I needed a real challenge this time.   I searched through my list of previous candidates. A chronic adulterer that I knew from work... far too easy. A juvenile delinquent I'd encountered... tempting, but not enough. I'd already done one similar case, and there is nothing more mundane than repetition. The more I dug, the more reasons I found to exclude every single one on my list. I needed something new.   I've always said that finding the right specimen is a matter of serendipity, and this instance proved it. I turned on the TV for the first time in a year. Is this what I used to do before my 'hobby' started? Show after show of fake human interaction that didn't even come close to portraying what people were really like. Sitcom stars obsessing over minor quibbles that had absolutely no relevance to their real issues. There should be a show about what I do; that would make for real entertainment.   I flipped through channels until I came to a stop on the local news. A story about a string of pets who had been gutted and skinned and left on porches in a quiet suburban neighborhood. ""Clearly the work of a deranged psychopath,"" the news anchor concluded.  I watched the section over and over again. That line got to me every time. Someone out there like me... that I could fix. I could mold them into something better. Into me.   I clicked off the TV and practically ran to my desk to find the closest pet shop. If they were still open, I could get my bait tonight and get a jump on finding this new candidate.     Here's part 3!"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,I_WANT_YOUR_PICTURE,199,Thu May 21 16:14:18 2015 UTC,"I bought a puppy, one who was incredibly friendly and just wanted to meet everyone. Bait doesn't work very well if it runs away, does it? I outfitted him with a GPS tracking collar, and let him scamper around the neighborhood that had been mentioned on the news. The name given to him at the pet shop was ""Almond,"" which I thought was an odd name for a dog. I'd had the pet shop engrave it on the collar in the hopes that this might entice my target even more; I had no way of knowing how he selected his victims. I'd also asked them to carve in an address on the back. If I was right about this new candidate, he would have to make a stop there at some point.  Then, I waited, for weeks. Night after night, I watched the dot on the monitor race around the neighborhood as the dog darted to and fro, sniffing everything and greeting anyone he might see at this time of night, which was rare. Most of these homes were full of young families, too tired from taking care of their kids to go run around at midnight. There were a few false alarms: sometimes Almond would just get tired and lay in one spot for too long. I had to remind myself to be patient; if this new candidate was as good as I thought, then this needed to be done carefully. There were three more pets disemboweled during this time, so I knew that he was still active.  It was pouring rain the night that it finally happened. Perhaps that was just a coincidence, or maybe the killer was just smart enough to only work when there was cover when no one else would be outside.   I was in my car listening to the drumbeat on the metal roof when I noticed that the GPS dot was still. I turned on the car and kept an eye on it as I drove closer. Still no movement. It's possible that Almond is just taking cover from the rain, I told myself as I drove slowly through the dark streets. Don't get your hopes up. I traced the signal to an empty park, rimmed with tall leafy trees. There was a sandbox in one corner with brightly-colored playground equipment and some rusted swings, but otherwise seemed empty.  I waited nearby for at least half an hour. Almond didn't move the entire time, and my optimism swelled with each passing minute. I wanted to go confront him, but I had no idea how he'd react, and I didn't want to just scare him deeper underground and make it impossible for me to ever find him again.  A dark shadow slipped out of the trees and moved quickly into the street. He was smaller than I'd expected. Maybe not even a teenager yet. I was briefly disappointed; children were so impressionable. Where's the challenge in that? Half of me wanted to give up on this target altogether and find someone new, but deep down I knew that this was still my best chance for an exciting experiment. I waited until he had disappeared around the corner, then started the car and drove over to the house: a dark, two-story red-brick colonial where the Linden family was probably asleep in their beds. This was address that I had picked to have engraved into Almond's collar. I climbed out of my car, and I waited in the rain.  It only took a few minutes for him to appear around the corner. The shadow moved across the lawn, and I noticed that there was a bundle in his arms. It wasn't hard to figure out what it was: I could just faintly hear the tinkling of metal from the collar. He placed Almond's remains on the doorstep with almost reverent gentleness and scampered away into the night. And I followed.  Had I been less confident in my abilities, I may have suspected that he knew he was being followed. But I'd been doing this for years, and had grown quite adept at not being seen by my prey. We went through backyards and over fences and across a creek and through a small patch of woods. Had I tried using the car, I would have lost him easily. But finally, he slowed down. In front of a simple, white, ranch-style home, he removed his hood and pulled keys from his pocket.  Sorry, not his pocket: her pocket. As the figure passed under a streetlight, I finally got a clear glimpse of her tightly braided hair and soft features. A girl, no more than 16. She had been the one who had torn Almond apart and left his pelt and bleeding remains on the Linden's porch. I was a bit surprised, but why not? Mental illness doesn't discriminate based on gender. She would be just as good of a candidate as any young man.  I silently took a photo and wrote down the address. Time to go home and do some research about this seemingly nice family at 214 Acacia Rd.     Part 4 here!"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Judasthehammer,199,Thu May 21 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"Emily Winters. Daughter of James Winters, a local construction contractor, and Marie Winters, manager of First National Bank. Age, 16. Honor student and star of the field hockey team at Lockfield High School. And, psychopathic pet torturer.  I had learned everything I could about Emily in the past few days: scanning the internet, archives of the local paper, and anything else I could get my hands on. Like me, she had mastered the art of projecting normality. I watched her outside of school, hanging out with friends and laughing along like she was just like them. Even her parents seemed blissfully oblivious as I watched them all through the windows of their home. They had no idea that their daughter was sneaking out at night to disembowel neighbors' pets.   ""I know what you are,"" I typed into the draft of the note. ""And I understand why you do what you do."" I wanted to make her curious, but not feel threatened. ""I don't want to change you or try to 'fix' you. I just want to show you a better way. Safer, and far more satisfying."" I tried to imagine how I would have convinced myself when I was younger. ""If you are interested, just call this number."" I'd bought two 'burner' phones that couldn't be traced to either of us. She had to know that her secret was safe with me.   I printed it out and wrapped the note around her phone. When I was sure Emily was safely occupied in chemistry class, I returned to that park where I had first spotted her. Finding the grisly workspace was fairly easy. She'd made an effort to clean up the blood and patches of fur but the ground was all torn apart from burying the evidence, and the leaves that she had haphazardly scattered did a poor job of covering everything up. She is really lucky that I came along to help before the police found this site. A closer examination of the area revealed a neatly wrapped cache of knives, wiped clean and hidden inside a cavernous hollow of an oak trea. I tucked the note and phone into the bundle, returned it to the tree, and went home to wait.  Three maddening days passed. Every waking moment was spent focused on that phone. I was plagued by phantom vibrations every time I moved. All thoughts of anything else in my life were completely forgotten. I just had a good feeling about this one. It was a thrill I hadn't experienced since I first started correcting people's lives for them. Emily would be my magnum opus. My apprentice.  Now why wouldn't she call??  Across the kitchen, the phone jingled softly. I lunged forward, dropping the tray of food in my hand and spilling freshly sliced vegetables all over my kitchen floor.  ""Who is this?"" She asked. There wasn't even a hint of fear in her voice.   ""Hello, Emily,"" I responded carefully. I couldn't tell her who I was just yet, and I wanted to remind her that I knew all about her if she decided to turn me in. Maybe she'd claim I was stalking her. Hell, maybe she'd convince the police that I had killed those pets.  There was a long pause. ""Who are you?"" She asked again. ""What do you want with me?""  I sighed softly. This would take a while to explain.  ""I am your guardian angel,"" I started.    More to come! If you're enjoying this one, you should subscribe here to /r/Luna_Lovewell for plenty of other stories.  Edit: I haven't forgotten about this, I just have a lot of work to do. I hope to get to it this afternoon!"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,I_WANT_YOUR_PICTURE,108,Thu May 21 22:33:04 2015 UTC,"It took more than a month to get her to come around, but if I am anything, it is patient. She was skeptical at first, but I was able to finally convince her. I told her about Sarah and Gina and all of my other specimens and how I had been able to help them. And how I wanted to help her find a more... constructive way of exploring her particular emotional detachment. And when she was finally ready, I helped her pick her first specimen of her own.   She chose a boy in her class named Derek, the type of anti-social outcast that you expect to see in the news for shooting up the school. He already wore a black trenchcoat to school every day; all he needed was the rifle and disgruntled manifesto. Emily decided she was going to make him the most popular boy in school. She took to the task with utter glee, and I had to say: she was an absolute natural. Even I was learning from her; this 'social media' was an incredibly powerful tool for manipulating the emotions of her peers. I watched in awe as she utterly crushed the remnants of self-esteem that a particular bullying cheerleader had left. I had certainly chosen well.  Derek's transformation was so fast that I had to caution Emily to slow down a bit. Too much of a nudge and a person would feel it. The specimen can never know that he is really a puppet.  Derek stopped wearing all black and found his fashion sense. He started working out and getting into shape. Emily subtly transitioned their budding friendship into a full-on relationship, using her own popularity to boost his reputation. She helped him worm his way into the popular cliques at school until his attention was literally fought over. And Derek was a whole different person. I had been following his posts online, and the angry ranting had become gleeful bragging  Emily was different too. Most importantly, the killings stopped. Pets were no longer disappearing, and her little lair in the park remained abandoned. I'd go by to check occasionally to make sure that she wasn't lapsing back into old habits. The tools were still tucked away in her tree and the dirt was starting to settle. A few more weeks and all evidence of her behavior would be erased.   After only six months of work, Derek broke up with Emily. He just 'wasn't ready to be tied down' at this point in his life. Emily reported that he was already hooking up with at least three other girls, one of them a senior. She played the part magnificently, crying about how she loved him and how her life would never be the same. We'd planned this out far ahead of time, and come to the conclusion that this would be Derek's graduation. Once he was so confident in his new status that he could dump the most popular girl at school, then Emily would be done. She would be ready for a brand new specimen. And so would I.  I put it off for long enough. Emily had already chosen another target, she told me. The same cheerleader that she'd so brutally destroyed while fixing Derek, actually. She was starting her own new folder, and I needed to as well. A roaring fire burned in my hearth, casting dancing shadows around the room and asking for Emily's folder. Begging for it. I'd held on to it, telling myself that maybe this was too fast. Maybe she still needed my help. She didn't have the same emotional weakness that my other specimens had, so there would be no moment of 'happiness' signalling the end of my little arrangement. But enough was enough: I thrust the folder into the fire.  Who next? I clicked on the TV again. The beginning of a new ritual for me, perhaps? That was how I had found Emily, wasn't it?  Derek's photo was on the news:  Local high schooler found disembowled on his own front porch."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Captain_Pooface,96,Sat May 23 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"Can't be, I told myself as I drove. She was reformed!  My tires screeched as I pulled up to the park. The lush trees, right in the middle of blooming, swayed gently in the night breeze. It seemed serene and peaceful; hardly the place that you'd expect to find a murder site. I knew better, though. I headed to her clearing, avoiding fallen twigs and anything else that might make noise. But it was empty. Her work was long done.  Just as I suspected: churned-up dirt. The knives had been moved. The leaves had been scattered, looking grossly out of place now that it was no longer autumn. This was very reckless of her. She was here. She had killed here. I furiously dialed the phone.  ""Emily...""  ""You heard,"" she interrupted me. ""Don't lecture me. I couldn't help it, ok? That thrill from changing someone's life is cool. You're right. But then I realized: I could go further then that. I was the one that raised Derek up. I made him. And then... I took it all away. I had complete control. You should have seen the look in his eyes when he realized what was happening.""  ""Emily, that's not what we do,"" I started to explain.  ""Not what you do,"" she retorted. ""I don't have to do the same. I can do what I want.""  ""You're going to get caught,"" I warned her.  It took another two weeks of convincing, but she agreed to try again.  She'd work on her current specimen, that depressed cheerleader. And she'd stop there. No more putting herself at risk with needless violence.     She made an excuse after each kill. ""Kelly was a moron,"" she told me after that particular relapse. ""She wasn't worth my effort."" I'd gritted my teeth and told her that she just needed to try again. It was hard dealing with normal people with all their flaws, but it had to be done. The specimens weren't just about controlling someone's life, it was also about perfecting the art of blending in. If Emily kiled everyone who pissed her off, she wouldn't last long.   She managed a bit longer with Aaron, but I knew she was slipping. Cats started turning up dead once again. I didn't even bother going to her kill site to check for any animal remains; not worth my time. At first, I let it happen. Maybe it was just a safety valve for her. Allowing her to blend in with everyone else while still satisfying her lust for violence. She knew that I was checking her kill site, too. She got sneakier. She started mixing things up, killing in other locations. But when Aaron was murdered in his own home, I knew that the animals weren't helping. Nothing had changed, and I had to put a stop to it. It wasn't just about her anymore: she was getting reckless, and she was going to get me in trouble too.  Emily worked so hard on Maria. An old lady at a nursing home, cut off from her family and desperately lonely. I'd commended Emily on picking such a worthy challenge: old age is a difficulty that even I had not yet tried out. No matter how good you are at manipulating people, there's no way to turn back time. Illness, dementia, death of friends and loved ones... even I had no way to counter these problems. But Emily was willing to try.    ""I lost my patience,"" she told me over the phone.   Fuck. Again?  ""I need help. I need to dispose of the body."" Normally confident, I heard fear in her voice for the first time. She was going to get caught, and I couldn't have that. She knew too much about what I'd done. Despite all of the people I'd helped, I was prety sure that ""the ends justify the means,"" wouldn't hold up in court.   I drove to the site. The trees were losing their leaves now, and the warm wind had changed to an icy chill. The branches rattled against each other like dry bones.  Maria's body was in the clearing. Emily's largest knife stuck straight out of her back, and there was a massive red splotch of blood on the floral patterned dress. What a disaster. I'd never regretted taking on a specimen before Emily, but this was just too much to handle.   Speaking of which... Emily was nowhere to be seen. I tapped my foot and lurked behind a tree, waiting for Emily to return. Perhaps with supplies needed to cover up the remains?   It had been less than five minutes when I noticed something under Maria. Flannel pattern, not floral. Had Emily really been so stupid as to leave something of hers behind with the body? What was wrong with that girl? I rolled the corpse over, causing the bloody knife to flop out onto the forest floor.  It was a shirt. MY shirt. Ripped and dirtied, but definitely mine. Covered in blood, and likely with hairs. MY hairs, and Maria's blood. Probably some fingerprints too.  Fuck  Sirens wailed and lights flashed as a squad car pulled up only a few meters from my own car. The police had arrived at the park. Someone had tipped them off. Someone who knew I would be here waiting to help dispose of the body. Someone who had stolen my shirt and planted it at the scene, along with who knows what else.   Emily. She wanted me out of her life, and she wanted a scapegoat for the murders. And she'd neatly made sure that any story I told to the contrary would sound utterly crazy.   Lights bounced through the woods as overweight police officers charged forward with their flashlights out. Not particularly subtle, were they?   Fuck"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Winterspark,127,Sat May 23 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"Now there were three bodies, laying side by side with matching knives sticking out of their necks. But I'd at least bought myself some time. I killed them silently and told the dispatcher that there was nothing here. ""Just another false alarm."" It would probably take about 45 minutes for someone to realize that they'd never return. That was sufficient, though.  I cleaned the site quickly. Emily had planted a few other bits of evidence in the area, too. A business card from my wallet, half buried about ten feet away. A receipt from that little sandwich shop next to my office. Small things like that. She must have broken into my apartment at some point without me knowing. It was enough to cast clear suspicion on me, but not enough to make it seem like I was framed. Emily was smart enough to not drop my driver's license and a phony 'I did it' manifesto.   I quickly returned to my car to retrieve a cannister of gasoline and a book of matches. A quick douse over the bodies, and the deed was done. Soon the entire park would be up in flames; I'd made sure that the gas trail led all the way to a nearby house, too. The firefighters would be concerned with putting that out and making sure that it didn't spread to the rest of the neighborhood. By the time they addressed the fire in the park, anything I'd missed would be completely incinerated.     Emily's house was completely dark. I knew she was still awake, probably quietly listening to the radio for any news of my arrest. And, if her plan failed, waiting for me.   ""Meet me in the back yard,"" I texted.  She emerged from the house wearing a light blue tank top and rubber ducky pajamas. Her normally flowing hair was done up in braids to make her look younger. A perfectly calculated defense; nobody would ever believe that this innocent girl was a brutal murderer.  ""Emily, you can't keep killing people like this. I burned the body, but this is your last chance, I swear."" She hid her surprise well, but she wasn't nearly on my level yet. I saw right through the disguise, but said nothing. ""You get one more,"" I continued. ""One more specimen, and then we're done."" I could almost hear the gears churning in her mind as she quickly thought about how to regain the high ground and turn this to her advantage.  ""Thank you,"" she answered. ""I was just so worried. I didn't know what to do with Maria. You're right; I shouldn't have tried her."" She smiled sweetly.  Who do you think I am? I wanted to shout at her. Just another person that you can wrap around your finger? I know what you are.  ""It's all right,"" I told her. ""Maria is gone and there's nothing to connect you to the crime. You cleaned up all the evidence, right?""  Had I overplayed my hand? She paused before responding.  ""Yes,"" she said. ""There was nothing at the scene, I was sure of it."" She was a good liar, I had to admit. Shame that I'd wasted my teaching on her.   I nodded toward the sliding door of her house. ""Get back to sleep, then. I have a good idea for a specimen for you that I'll tell you about tomorrow."" She nodded and headed back in.  It only took one thrust. The knife slid right between her shoulder blades, perfectly flat. I shoved with all my might as the knife struck her spine. I reached forward and wrapped a hand over her mouth, stifling the cry of pain just in time. With a second knife, I slit her throat and finished the job. What a disappointment she had turned out to be. I dragged her back inside, silently dispatched the family, and then used the rest of my gasoline to start another blaze. By the time the fire department got here too, everything would be gone.  I returned home. No police waiting, which was a good sign.   Emily's folder was waiting on my desk. I lit a fire for the third time that night, only this time in a fire place. Then I burned her folder, once again. There wouldn't be another for her. For the first time in years, I'd lost control. I'd failed with a specimen. How could that be possible?  There was only one thing to do: time to pick another."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Bozzie0,36,Sat May 23 04:18:09 2015 UTC,"Hi Luna! I just want to say I really love your stories.   I really love the ending you have for this particular story. Though I can't help but wonder if the main character has turned into Emily as well -- killing his specimens whenever he ""failed"" with them. Would you be writing more to this story?"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,simanthropy,10,Sat May 23 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think there is a significant difference here. He only kills in ""self defense"", I.e. To protect himself and his secret. She kills because she wants the thrill. Had he not killed her, he and his life would continue to be at risk."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Musefan58867,6,Sat May 23 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree with your view. I was wondering, though, if the act of killing her would change anything for him. He might have killed her to protect himself and his secret, but the act itself also ""tainted"" his hands, or even his mind. Would he find reasons to kill again? Or would he pretend this whole thing never happened?"
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,GinkoWeed,1 point,Sat May 23 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like he gets his thrill from controlling people and sees the act of killing as loss of control, hence no urge to kill. Sorry if you've lost interest after five days, I just read the story."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,dirtnsnow,19,Fri May 29 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"That was an excellent story. I feel so sorry for him, using his differences to try and help people and yet having it backfire on him horrifically in the end. I think I might feel a bit less sorry for him due to the string of murders he just did. I'm sure he'd say it was necessary, of course. Hopefully he doesn't turn into Emily himself. I feel conflicted here, because he was like the hero, but when things went south he was perfectly fine with doing evil as well. I really liked him early on, but now I'm unsure how to feel about him. Congrats on getting me so invested in the character :D"

Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,the_boyblunder,1 point,Thu May 21 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Good suggestion!
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,sc4s2cg,3,Thu May 21 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was just with the direct contrast between that line and the previous sentence about his need for control. The ""might as well"" suggests to me he kind-of-sort-of does care about doing the right thing, while from the previous short story I got the impression he doesn't care for torture because other psychopaths didn't find what they were looking for there, so he focused on the other end of the spectrum."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,mad_mike15,9,Thu May 21 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"I might not be knowledgeable enough in this area of knowledge. I seem to remember a bit in psychopathology that psychopaths (ASPD) lean more toward this manipulative aspect beyond that of a norm and also a sensation-seeking behavior (akin to adrenaline junkie).  Then of course, this developing short story or novella might carry with it significant literary analysis of our current mental health situation. This psychopath operates internally under the perceived characteristics but his outward behaviors are stereotypically opposite.  Luna, if you haven't. I think this short story requires sincere attention as it might be influential and particularly worthy of publishing as it could captivate national attention on mental health awareness."
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,TBestIG,2,Thu May 21 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"You could say that this way, he doesn't get cops and shit on him? it's less annoying this way, and you're still controlling people"

Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,FireStormNZ,3,Thu May 21 18:31:03 2015 UTC,I got it. The ultimate challenge will be when two psychopaths collide and have a battle of the psychopaths against each other without knowing the other is a psychopath.  Or maybe they both pick the same target and have a battle trying to make that target's life better or worse without actually meeting each other.
Luna_Lovewell,36ri2r,Fordiman,2,Thu May 21 18:08:39 2015 UTC,This would make an amazing full book/short story.

Luna_Lovewell,36mvi1,thechairinfront,31,Wed May 20 16:07:43 2015 UTC,Every story I have ever heard of the Devil is that is he indeed a man of his word however.
Luna_Lovewell,36mvi1,Vorteth,16,Wed May 20 16:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, but the dudes says ""I've got everything I want"". He doesn't ask for no retribution from the Devil so the Devil could very well open up a hole under him and have him fall in a pit of snakes or something."
Luna_Lovewell,36mvi1,thechairinfront,6,Wed May 20 17:04:49 2015 UTC,Very true.
Luna_Lovewell,36mvi1,Vorteth,6,Wed May 20 17:06:22 2015 UTC,I agree.

Luna_Lovewell,36moux,FadeKing,2,Wed May 20 23:08:23 2015 UTC,I'd totally be down for that.  Unless my charity of choice didn't line up with my story of choice.   I guess I could...vote twice...

Luna_Lovewell,36moux,Stone-D,2,Wed May 20 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"Nice work, as usual! I like it. The story's about the hunter and the hunter's motivations - the creature is a just a prop.

Luna_Lovewell,36moux,Burleyman24,2,Wed May 20 22:44:28 2015 UTC,I would say it's intentional because it's the deadliest beast on that specific world. Jut a guess though.
Luna_Lovewell,36moux,Zarkloyd,2,Thu May 21 01:47:44 2015 UTC,"This is true, but the story had explained that this dude had hunted many such 'deadliest' beasts, so merely being the best on one world wouldn't be enough of a draw."

Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,Luna_LoveWell,66,Tue May 19 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"I wrote this one under the username /u/PIApplepie. In a post yesterday, there were some people claiming that my stories only get upvoted because people now recognize my username, and that most of them don't deserve the score that they get. I think that is insulting and really not true. So I made a different username and posted this story. I took screenshots of the results here, to show that even with a different name, my post still did quite well. When I took the screenshots, my comment had 115 points, and the next highest had 16. I also waited to submit it to my subreddit here so that they couldn't claim someone came from here to upvote it there.   So there we go. Next time you see someone claiming that my stories are only upvoted because they come from me, you can show them this."
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,El_Mono_Rojo,34,Tue May 19 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"Ha! I'm blown away by that allegation. I find it much more common to read a response, think afterwards, 'That was really well done!' and then go back and see you were the poster. Why imaginary internet points matter to anyone is beyond me and great post!"
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,Vahexhal,10,Tue May 19 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah... the haters. It's easy for people to hate on something good instead of improving their writing or doing something useful. They're always going to be out there. I think you might get picked on by some of them a bit more because you had a surge of followers for awhile there... I found your sub somewhere around 3k subscribers. I subbed shortly before the 5k subs adventure story. I wasn't really paying attention to the subs and then you had your 10k subscriber story and I was like ""when did that happen o.o"" ... and actually, you're already up to almost 13k now, lol.  I'm pretty sure a lot of your subscribers had a similar experience to mine. The discovering Luna phase: ""Oh, that was a good prompt reply I wonder who did that... hmm, some Luna person."" Followed by some ""Good prompt I wonder who... oh Luna again."" The looking for Luna phase: ""An interesting prompt! Lets see if Luna made a reply."" The subscribe phase: ""She has awesome stories, posts frequently, carries on worlds, makes books... yeah... where's that subscribe button.""  I'd be willing to bet after some time there are a good number in the withdrawal stage, too, lol. I don't check WritingPrompts nearly as much as I used to; in a way it's a little sad, but there isn't always enough time and most days when I'm checking for a quick item to read I'd prefer it to be good. It's kind of the same reason WP suffers (depending on who's opinion you take) from the first good response that gets a decent amount of votes continuing to be upvoted without other replies being read - people don't have time to sift through all the posts really.  But, WritingPrompt isn't supposed to be a competition for internet points. The people using it as an outlet for creative writing practice are doing it properly. The good writers getting followers are undoubtedly happy people are enjoying their stuff. If it wasn't you they were hating on it would be one of the other good writers who post there; some people just have nothing better to do than pick on others. So, don't worry about it too much =p"
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,NonsenseMachine,8,Tue May 19 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"To the extent it makes you feel better, I used to read r/WritingPrompts/, but now I visit your subreddit almost exclusively. I generally only read other redditor's writing when their submission gets enough upvotes to make it to my front page and the prompt is interesting, whereas I read everything you put out."
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,cowvin2,6,Tue May 19 22:37:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, i never read the name of the poster before reading the post.  i just end up liking some stories and noticing that they came from the same person (like you) sometimes."
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,cobywaan,3,Tue May 19 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"I have the same story that so many have for this. I first noticed /r/writingprompts awhile ago, and thought it was pretty cool, but not amazing. Eventually I started looking through some of the top prompts responses, and keep going ""Wow, that was a good one, who wrote it?"". And it would be you 4/5 times.  Now I check your subreddit far more than I check writing prompts, and if anything, when I see the most interesting prompts there, it makes me want to go back and see what other people came up with.  I guarantee, if you wrote under any username, that name would eventually become one of the top posters. Cream rises to the top. Anyone saying you are only getting your recognition because of your name is a fool. No one knew you before you started posting, you provide the best content here, and it is recognized as the best.  Hell, if anything, the haters are a sign you made it. As Reggie Jackson said ""People don't boo nobodies""."
Luna_Lovewell,36j3w2,Vorteth,1 point,Thu May 21 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"I read and upvote every single story I have seen you come out with. I just kind of wish some of the continuation stories were coming out as independent posts because I miss some of the replies.  Regardless, I upvote them not because you are you, but because they are bloody amazing.  Granted I try to upvote pretty much any story teller because I find that as long as they tried it makes me think about the prompt a bit differently."

He just doesn't know how to relate to people and make friends. He tries to join in and be 'one of the guys' but just goes so overboard that he ends up annoying people. Maybe he's a bit autistic or has aspbergers.   I wanted the story to make you sympathize with the dragon despite how Lucas feels about him."

I did a a second search for ""Lovewell author"" and I only got a couple of authors that wrote nonfiction or self-help books.  I like the name Lovewell. I think it is distinctive and you could make it a household name. If you want to change the first name I liked the Elle that was mentioned. But also it would be ok to use L.  If you want ideas for other first names you could use Robin, Reina, or anything really. I think you might want to avoid using wa or la sounds because lovewell already has a lot of those."

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,DAVENP0RT,73,Fri May 15 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think using ""Luna Lovewell"" would give the impression that this is somehow related to or based on harry potter when the book is really very different from that. I also don't know if that would stir up legal issues with Rowling's copyright stuff, even if it isn't directly copying the name from her. I'd rather use something else, but I was also considering making it somehow related to this name, like publishing under ""Elle L. W."" or something."
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,Kitteas,45,Sat May 16 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think that you should craft your name from something that means a lot to you. ""Elle L. W."" is okay, but you don't have to connect yourself to your Reddit account if you intend on branching out.

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,Hyenabreeder,2,Sat May 16 07:15:42 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the explanation and I'll keep turning ideas over and see what pops.

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,Cawendaw,5,Sat May 16 01:07:52 2015 UTC,Treat it like a good band name. The fewer words and syllables the better. Diana Love. There you go. Or just Lovewell. That's your best bet.
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,cowvin2,17,Sat May 16 14:58:50 2015 UTC,"L. L. Aurelius  L. L. For Luna Lovewell. As for the last name, well, your first ever book began with a gilded post, right?"
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,ziztark,15,Sat May 16 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"For your last name I nominate: Merwhitty.  Reasoning:  I'm going to start with your current pen name because I'm not sure where else to start.  The latin variations are all taken, so I've ruled out those.  However, you did write two Ancient Egypt stories, so I started there.  This dictionary lists ""mrwty"" as ""well beloved,"" so maybe we could do something with that.  Following the egyptological practice (it should be noted that I am not in any way an egyptologist) of throwing in an ""e"" where we think there's a missing vowel, that would give us ""merwty,"" ""merewty,"" or ""merwety.""  The last one seems like the easiest to spell/pronounce for an anglophone, but ""wetty"" has, ah, unfortunate connotations.  How about ""wity"" or ""witty"" instead?  A quick google search tells me that ""merwity"" brings up 23,000 results (because it assumes you meant ""merwitz,"" an actual name), while ""merwitty"" brings up 5, all but one stemming from an 1844 gazette of Afghan place names.  If you add an h and make it ""merwhitty"" that brings it down to 4, all pointing to a not-very-active russian social media profile.  If you wanted to further differentiate it you could go with Marwhitty or Merewhitty or Muir-Whitty or Muir-Whittier (although ""Marwhitty"" might be uncomfortably close to ""more witty,"" which is a bit on the nose).  I don't really have any thoughts on the first name, but you could choose an ""m"" name and make it alliterative.  Maria Merwhitty?  Marina Merwhitty?  Marion Merwhitty?"
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,jasenlee,38,Sat May 16 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"You should be Luna_LoveWell because that's what we all know you by already.  Or are you looking for a name that sounds more serious for paper publishing?  In that case, something like ""L. L. Wells"" maybe?"

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,LordBlackletter,6,Sat May 16 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"I personally think L.L Wells sounds good, it's easy to remember and keeps a little reference to your username, and should be easy to find in a search engine, since right now all that comes up is wells Fargo..

Is there a reason you don't want to use whatever your given name is? Do you want to use a scrambled version of your given name? What are you trying to achieve by using a pen name?"
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,sol_on_fire,18,Sat May 16 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"Are you opposed to just ""Luna Lovewell""?   Yes. I think using ""Luna Lovewell"" would give the impression that this is somehow related to or based on harry potter when the book is really very different from that. I also don't know if that would stir up legal issues with Rowling's copyright stuff, even if it isn't directly copying the name from her. I'd rather using something else, but I was also considering making it somehow related to this name, like publishing under ""Elle L. W."" or something.   Is there a reason you don't want to use whatever your given name is?   A few reasons. For one, I would prefer that it not affect my day job career, which does have a writing component to it. I wouldn't want someone to judge my technical writing if they found my fiction writing. Also, I am kind of shy about my writing and still haven't told anyone that I know about writing or publishing this book. Not even my parents or anything.   Do you want to use a scrambled version of your given name?   I could, but I think that's still too close of a link, I guess. I'd prefer to just make up something entirely new.   What are you trying to achieve by using a pen name?   Stay anonymous. That's about it."
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,BMXLore,4,Sat May 16 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"I like the LL initials, possibly just because it's been primed but none the less, perhaps Luna Lowe? (or Lock or Lovett or any other L surname you particularly enjoy*). There aren't any particularly prominent authors with that last name.  Or, since it's a pen name there's no reason you can't just cycle through a baby name database until you find a name you feel like describes your personality. It could be very dramatic if you wanted since it's a pseudonym, or realistic, it's up to you. You could pick for search optimization, prettiest autograph, or even pull a Lemony Snicket and build a character and a name to embody what you think your writing style is.  (*Lawrence, Langridge, Larson, Laws, Luxton, etc. I'm really fond of this L thing...)"

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,potentialPizza,3,Mon May 18 05:38:13 2015 UTC,I really like this one!
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,AcatnamedT,10,Sat May 16 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"So I'd just like to drop my two cents here.  Someone mentioned search optimization, so obviously something similar to Luna Lovewell so they can connect the two mentally. Unless you don't want future readers to see the stuff you put out before you ""got serious"".  Now I'd just like to say, the only author whose name I have ever remembered after reading only one book was James Lovegrove. His name was easy to remember, because the last name was words. So there's that.  Also, my favorite authors have always been those who follow a (Letter). (Letter). (Last Name) format. For example:   H. G. Wells C. S. Lewis J. K. Rowling Lee Harvey Oswald John Wilkes Booth   Wait a second... yeah, those are all authors... right?  Anway, point is, the X. X. Name format seems to work well. I mean, people remember the ships as the S.S. Titanic or the H.M.S. Beagle, not Her Majesty's Ship Beagle, so clearly abbreviation is the way to go.  With this in mind, may I suggest:   L. L. Well (someone else said this, I think it works Well) J. K. Trolling W. P. Reddit (Writing Prompts Reddit, or perhaps...) L. L. Reddit (Luna Love(well) Reddit, an in-joke for those in-the-know?)   Now, since I just realized WHY PEOPLE WERE SAYING USE ""ELLE"" (LIKE CAN PEOPLE PLEASE EXPLAIN REASONING BEHIND THIS STUFF C'MON MAN), then I would like to suggest Ella instead, since Elle sounds kinda weird, at least the way I pronounce it.  I'd also like to refer you to Mark Twain, the king of pseudo-names in my opinion. His dream job was a ferry captain, so of course he chooses Twain (unit of distance in ferry language) and Mark, because something something marking distance.  So what is your dream job? Writing? If so could I suggest Ella Collate (printing term, to gather prints together, since you are releasing your first book you are trying to 'gather interest' in a way. Eh?) Although this does sound kinda funny. Perhaps C. C. Ella, C. C. being a pun on Carbon Copy (it's what CC in an email means, refers back to using a typewritter to make a copy of what you were typing). I think it'd work cause you don't want your penname to be a copy of your reddit name. Or at least it appears that way.  I'd suggest more, but it's like 2 in the morning. Either way, good luck with the book, I want you to know I'll be one of the first to write fanfiction about it.  No guarantees it won't be porn though."
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,zzzNEMOzzz,3,Sat May 16 09:16:40 2015 UTC,"What about ""Redita""? Kind of sounds like a real name while still referencing Reddit. Also since you're not directly saying Reddit then the joke is a little bit more concealed"
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,GenocideSolution,6,Sat May 16 19:37:33 2015 UTC,How do you come up with the names of your characters? I'm wondering if you base their name in qualities they have maybe you could do the same for yourself.
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,Black_Belt_Troy,3,Fri May 15 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I use names of people I know. Other times a name just kind of fits, I guess. I don't have a particular system for it."
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,DrThunderBunny,6,Sat May 16 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"I like the L. L. idea. So you just need a cool sounding last name. When people say ""cool sounding last name! go!""

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,suggex,4,Sat May 16 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"Search engine optimization should be the priority (as previously mentioned).   Second I think the name (as it is referred to) should have a cadence/rhythm. Two initials followed by a two-syllable last name is a proven successful strategy.  Lastly, when you choose names for the initials, it might be interesting to pick gender neutral names so as to further shroud your identity and let your readers imagine you as they will. Some close-minded people have a bias against authors of one gender over the other. Choosing a first name like ""Sam"" or ""Danny"" might be a clever maneuver around that."
Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,doublefudgebrownies,3,Sat May 16 05:02:23 2015 UTC,I think I remember hearing something about how JK Rowling chose her name so that you couldn't tell that she was female.

Luna_Lovewell,3644wd,theguywhoreadsbooks,1 point,Sat May 16 14:27:29 2015 UTC,What about Artemis for the first name? It references your book that is coming out about the Roman empire because it references roman mythology but I like Artemis (Diana's Greek name) more since Diana is a more mainstream name and Artemis evokes the moon more whereas Diana evokes your neighbor Diana if that makes any sense. The only problem is that Artemis has lots of search results already but with a more obscure last name like Merwhitty that problem is solved.

I wrote it with the idea that he had been entirely isolated by the military trying to find out what his purpose was, and they'd been so extreme that he would end up turning on the humans and siding with the aliens somehow.

Luna_Lovewell,35s4ee,Gallifrayan_Nerd,14,Wed May 13 01:33:42 2015 UTC,You'll have plenty of people here willing to give you a publicity boost when it comes out.
Luna_Lovewell,35s4ee,Imnotveryfunatpartys,9,Wed May 13 03:05:22 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts.. First, I would think about changing the title of the book.  ""Rex Electi"" may be interesting, but it doesn't relate to any agent, they most likely won't be able to make sense of it.  The thing about agents we must understand is that they get hundreds of queries daily, and if you are a new author, they might not even read your Query Letter if the name doesn't appeal to them.  An agent's job is to make your book appeal to a large audiance, and the title of the book is very important in catching interest.  You can always negotiate changing the title back to what you want after you find an agent, all of that could be negotiated.  First, make a very simple Title, one that would appeal to the general pubic, and resumbit.  Second, your query letter must be a homerun.  Agent's throw away more good books than they keep due to a bad or poor Query letter.  Maybe read some examples of good query letters online, things other authors have posted, and emulate their style.  You are trying to make a stranger interested in your book, and you only have their attention for two-three paragraphs.    Third, three is not enough letters to send out.  Don't get discouraged, just find more agents and send more.  Even the best novels in the world will get rejected a good 15-20 times before finding a good agent.  Those are good restarting grounds.  Quite a bit more I could tell you but thats a good start.  Good luck, and let me know if you have any follow up questions."

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,Luna_LoveWell,392,Mon May 11 20:07:18 2015 UTC,"I dug a trench almost two meters deep, running the entire length of the property. It took me forever, but it's been worth it. I've found kilos of iron that can be melted down and sold at the market for a small fortune! Gerome was so jealous after only one day of observing me that he promptly returned to his own property and dug a trench of his own.   Most of the metal comes from armor, though there were a few swords and spearheads in the mix as well (far too decayed to be useful, of course). The biggest haul was from that very first body that I found, clearly the leader of these men. He was carrying that unusual metal tube in his arms and wearing solid plate metal armor. Only Lord Hactran possessed such a suit in our society, though I had heard rumors of wealthy kingdoms in the southern hemisphere who might have similar treasures. In the rest of the field, I found forty three soldiers, outfitted in similar-looking chainmail. I assume that there was leather armor over that, but it had been long since eaten away by the fungus that thrives across the Sun Edge. I am thankful that it keeps the land fertile even in such harsh conditions, but I do regret that it had devoured any clues as to the identities of these soldiers. All wood and organic material has been wiped away, leaving only polished bones and aging metal.   The metals, though, are not what interested me most. I have found four of the strange tubes and collections of tiny metal balls. Two of them are so rusted and broken that they just cannot be salvaged. Even the most skilled metalworker in Harka would be unable to repair the many pits and holes. I do not know the purpose of these tools yet, but I am sure that the tube must be intact for it to function.   I pressed Gerome into my service, promising to help him prepare his farm some other time. The crude huts that we had built on our land would be sufficient for the time being, and planting season was just beginning. Gerome just doesn't see the importance of these artifacts. Even if I am unable to ever figure out what the tubes do, the armor alone will be enough to live off of for decades!   Together, we studied the tubes and made a rough mold of hard-packed clay. A farmer further from the Sun Edge who had been there for at least two harvests allowed us to use his furnace for the day. From the two corrupted tubes, we made one sturdy brand new one. The small metal pellets that I had found nearby the commander's body fit inside perfectly. But nothing happened. Was it some kind of instrument, maybe? Played by rattling the pellets? But why use valuable metal for such a worthless item when wood would have sufficed?  In desperation, I tried one last thought. The odd soil that I'd found near the tube held the key, saturated with some unknown white powder. I had only seen it near sites where I'd excavated the tubes, and not close to any of the other bodies. Perhaps that held the key? I placed some of the tainted soil inside the tube, and waited once again. Nothing.  ""You have to light it,"" the farmer said behind us. Gerome and I were so engrossed in our work that we had not even noticed him standing in the doorway. ""The white soil is good for plants,"" he said. ""But you have to be careful when you find patches of it, because it can explode under you. Many a careless farmer has been seriously injured by carelessly disposing of a cookfire's embers.   The hole in the top of the barrel made sense. Gerome pulled a twig from the nearby woodpile and dipped it into the roaring fire of the forge, then placed the burning twig inside the miniscule hole.  BOOOM. The tube in my hand erupted so hard that it flew uncontrollably out of my hands and skidded into the dirt meters away. Massive holes appeared across the room in the wood siding of the farmer's simple forge.   ""You boys are paying me back for that,"" he said calmly.    Here's part 3!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,hes_a_newt_Jim,341,Mon May 11 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"""Oh yes,"" Beerka said, wiping his soot-stained hands on his thick leather apron. ""If you've got the metal for it, I can make it."" He peered into the barrel. ""Probably improve it, too. Maybe make it use less metal, with enough testing. The concept is really pretty brilliant. This would be far more powerful than arrows or spears.""  He put the hollow tube back down on the table. ""You planning to sell them in the market?""  I hadn't thought that far. ""I guess so,"" I responded. Given how much metal they use, it would have to be expensive. Beerka knew everyone in the market place and would be able to help me find a pretty good deal.  He nodded. ""Better keep it quiet, then. There was another guy who had planned to start selling weapons in the market too and Hactran put an end to that right away. Comfiscated all of the guy's stock, crushed his hut, and sent him to the Star Edge on salvage duty, picking apart the remains of farms in the freezing cold for any remaining stock""  ""Sounds even less pleasant than the Sun Edge,"" I told him.   ""Oh, you have no idea,"" he said. ""A quarter of the salvagers don't make it back in time, so Hactran needs as many as he can find. Lucky for him there is no shortage of criminals in the city."" I'd had a number of run-ins with the law myself as a kid, and it was troubling to think just how close I'd come to being in that same position. ""I know you're a good kid, so I'm not going to rat you out. But no one else can know.""  ""Oh...""  Beerka glared. ""Who else did you tell?""  ""Just my neighbor,"" I said quickly. ""Another Settler like myself. The nobles wouldn't pay any attention to him. Oh, and another neighbor who let us use his forge.""  Beerka turned back to his work and began hammering at a horse shoe. ""Well you'd better hope that they don't tell anyone."" He stuck the hot iron into the water, sending up a hiss of steam.   ""I'd better get back home,"" I told him.    There was smoke on the horizon as I neared my plot.   Just another farmer burning refuse, I told myself as the old horse whinnied nervously. Getting ready for the next planting.  As I got closer, the pillar of smoke grew. Too big for a husk fire. I kicked the horse's sides and galloped closer.  It was the neighbor's home. The one whose forge we had used. All of his fields were torched and blackened, and the remains of his home were still white-hot embers. There were no signs of him or Gerome, but it wasn't looking good.  I returned to my own plot. The meager shack that I'd built had also been knocked down and burnt, but that was no big loss. But all of the metals I'd found were... gone. Every bit of armor and the other tubes were just gone.   Well, all except one. One outfit of old chainmail remained, nailed to a post in the center of my plot. And attached to that, a crudely-carved wooden sign:  ""We will find you, Settler.""    Here is part 4!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,rgbwr,383,Mon May 11 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"""Not in a week, Beerka. I need it today. I can't stay here.""  Beerka turned from his stone anvil with a glowing red hammer in hand.   ""What happened when you returned to your plot?"" he asked slowly.   I didn't respond to the question. Maybe I had omitted that part when I returned and told him that I did want him to make it for me. He'd never help me if he knew that Lord Hactran's men had my scent. Or if I told him about the burning farms of the only other people who knew about what I'd found.  ""I just can't go back there."" I was still covered in the stench of smoke and destruction; I was surprised that Beerka hadn't already realized what had happened. Or maybe he did know. ""Please, just help me. Fix whatever this is, and then I'll leave. I swear. And no one will ever know you were involved.""   He glared at me and gripped the hammer even tighter. For a split second, I was at least relieved that Hactran's men wouldn't send me to the Star Edge, because Beerka was going bash my head in right then and there. But he clapped a powerful hand on my shoulder, almost sending me sprawling across the sandy floor of his workshop.  ""Fine,"" he said. ""But only because you were the best damn assistant I ever had. I at least owe you this much. Here, give it to me and get to the bellows. We have work to do.""  I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, handed him the metal tube, and stoked the fire.    ""Up north, near the Ice Wastes, the space between the Sun Edge and the Star Edge is very very thin. So thin that there is no space for a farm; even if you could make it into a very long narrow farm, you wouldn't have time to harvest the crops before the Star Edge passed."" Beerka's friend Howell was the most traveled merchant in all of Harka. He was the only one who had ever been so far north. ""And nothing natural has time to grow there; even the fastest ivy creepers can't spread fast enough. So it is a deserted wasteland. You'll need a lot of extra food for this leg of the journey.""  Howell pulled out a wide piece of paper and spread it over the table that Beerka had cleared off in the back of the workshop. He traced the crescent outline of the livable zone, and drew a route going ever upwards.   ""The trickiest part will be the Laran Mountains."" He pointed to a ridge about 3/4s of the way up the map. ""The map is still new, but reliable, I promise. We discovered this pass many harvests ago, and it's been clear every time I've been through. But the weather can be unpredictable: you have to move quickly or else you'll get trapped in there when the Star Edge arrives in a little more than two harvest's time.""  I studied it closely. ""Pass through the Laran mountains. Two harvests from now. Got it.""  He pointed at the very edge of the map, which was an unblemished blank space waiting to be filled in. ""Your other option is to approach the mountains on the very cusp of the Sun Edge and hope that you can find a new pass.""  ""Sounds risky,"" I said.   ""Well, we don't have many records from last time we circled these peaks,"" he explained. ""But the old legends do speak of mountain passes. So we know they are there, just not where exactly.  I studied the paper.   ""I guess I'll decide as I go, depending on my progress,"" I decided.   ""Good idea,"" he answered. ""Once you make it past the mountains, you'll eventually reach the edge of the Ice Wastes. Now, I've never traveled this route, but I have heard stories that there is a narrow zone where you'll be safe. Right where the Sun Edge desert meets the Ice Wastes, the mixture of the two will make it temperate enough to travel. You'll have fresh water... maybe even some plant life.""  ""But you've never seen it, right?""  ""No,"" he answered after a short pause. ""But it should be there...."" Howell didn't sound entirely convinced.  ""Or it could not be there and I'll die, right?""  Before Howell could answer, Beerka stormed back into the workshop. ""You need to go now,"" he said emphatically, thrusting the metal tube into my hands. Unlike the twisted misshapen lump I'd brought him, the metal was polished and smooth and straight. Now that Howell and I had stopped speaking, I could hear the distant din of voices shouting. Something was happening outside. ""You've got twenty pellets and enough powder if you ration it carefully. Did Howell show you the route?""  I nodded as Howell thrust the paper into my pack.   ""Good,"" Beerka said, pushing me out the door. ""Then you're all set; get out of my sight.""  I nodded and mounted my horse, the only reminder of my life as a Settler on the Sun Edge. The horse whinnied nervously as voices rose somewhere down the street. Guards were searching homes. Looking for me.  I swung unsteadily into the saddle. This whole riding thing was unfamiliar.   ""Thank you, Beerka. And you, Howell. I know it was a risk for you.""  Beerka looked at me with an expression I'd never seen before: tears welled up in his eyes.   ""Just... get out of here,"" he managed to mutter, slapping the horse's rump and sending me galloping away from Harka.    Here's part 5!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,El_Q,193,Tue May 12 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"I was down to eight pellets by the time I reached the pass through the Laran Mountains.  I used 3 of them trying to kill an ice hen that I stumbled across roughly thirty kilometers from the city. The farms here were nearly in the center of the habitable zone, and the plants were lush and prosperous. This particular farmer had taken a gamble and grown harad grapes, and it seemed to be paying off quite nicely for him. I was stuffing my face full of the sweet fruits, purple juice dribbling down my chin, when I heard the clucking. It was almost unheard of to see ice hens this far west; they nested across the Star Edge to avoid predators and only came into the habitable zone for food. And I was still more than 2 days' ride from the Star Edge.  Howell's warning came back to me, reminding me that I'd need to save my food stores for the trip around the polar ice cap. Beerka had given me what little meat he had left in his larder, but it wasn't much. A nice plump ice hen would make a fine meal, and I was already starting to get sick of these grapes.  I crept as close to the hen as I dared; they were easily startled. I removed the weapon from its holster on my back and carefully loaded it with powder and one of the projectiles. I took aim using the little notch that Beerka had wisely carved into the center of tube...  BOOOM!  I'd forgotten just how loud the damn thing was! The hen took off like mad, having never heard anything like that in its short little life. I cursed my terrible aim and leaped back onto the horse, trying to reload the tube while still following the hen. The second shot was pitifully sloppy, and didn't land anywhere close to the hen. By the time I managed to reload for another, I was beginning to draw a crowd of local farmers, both curious about the tremendous noise and upset about me galloping through their crops. The last shot came closest: I swear that I clipped one of the ice hen's feathers. But it disappeared into the underbrush and I lost the trail, leaving me with three fewer bullets, no dinner, an upset mob of farmers, and grape-stained hands.   Soldiers caught up to me a few days later. Naturally someone had reported all the commotion. I was an idiot for ever thinking that I could catch that bird, and even more so for not realizing that it would draw their attention.   It was a perfect, clear day. The first day that I was finally able to see the mountains rising in the distance. Just the sight of those lofty peaks filled me with hope and confirmed that I was on the right track. And just when I was thinking of stopping for a celebratory meal, I heard the faint pounding of hooves behind me. A dust cloud sped across the plains, trampling crops underneath them that I'd carefully sidestepped only hours ago. I galloped forward to the top of a nearby low hill and prepared to make my stand.   ""Don't come any closer,"" I warned them as they dismounted at the bottom of the hill. Five archers, and one armored knight carrying a mighty, metal axe. Not just a bit of heavy wood wrapped in metal, but a solid steel ax! Hactran cared enough about recovering this thing that he'd risk losing such a weapon? In response to my threat, the archers loosed a flight of arrows. They whistled toward me and sank into the soft dirt wall that I'd hastily dug out for protection.   The armored knight advanced toward me. He swung the ax effortlessly through the air like he was warming up before an execution. Did he know about this device? Did he know what it could do? I took careful aim and concluded that no, he had no idea what it was. If he did, he would be running toward me.   BOOOM! The weapon's roar echoed through the valley, scaring all six of the soldiers' horses and sending them bolting in all directions. My own mellow steed had gotten somewhat used to the noise and only whinnied with displeasure. The knight charging up the hill stopped and lowered the ax to the ground. The archers watched with arrows notched, waiting for the order to fire again. There was an eerie silence, and I noticed that even the birds and insects had been silenced by the weapon's roar. Then, the knight toppled over and slid back down the slope.   The archers didn't know how to react. One of them fired back, but he was nervous or scared; the shot went wild and soared into a stand of trees to my right. Three of them took cover behind some low rectangular stones. The remaining soldier just stood dumbly, watching the armored figure of his commander slide down the hill like a child's sled. I shot that one next.   We traded fire for what seemed like hours. The dirt trench that I'd hastily dug was peppered with wooden quills, and the smell of the explosive powder filled the air until I could barely breathe. I finally killed a fourth archer, leaving only one survivor. It had taken 9 of my precious pellets, but it was better than being butchered.  ""Go,"" I told him. ""Tell Lord Hactran how your comrades fell, and that I'm coming for him next!""  The archer didn't answer, but scampered back to his horse and galloped away as fast as possible. I had absolutely no intention of going after Hactran, but that would at least keep them all busy with security preparations while I made for the mountains.   I collected the bows of the fallen, the arrows sticking out of my primitive fortification, and the knight's heavy ax. They'd also left some scraps of food and other supplies in the saddlebags of their horses, which I loaded onto my own trusty mount. It wasn't much, but every bit would count.   At the top of the hill, I made a fire. There's no way the soldiers could get reinforcements from Harka in time to find me here, and I'd earned a bit of rest and relaxation. I had a taste of wine for the first time in months. Good stuff, too. This knight must have been someone important. It was good enough that maybe I had a bit too much and ended up slumped in my makeshift trench waiting for the stars to stop spinning. Instead, I focused on the rough stones underneath the dirt. Stones that I hadn't noticed when I was too busy fighting. Stones that had carvings on them. Letters. Symbols. Drawings. I couldn't read even in my own tongue, but I knew enough to realize that this wasn't the same script. The drawings were easier to decipher. The Sun Edge, with wavy lines of scorching heat. The Star Edge, with icy crystals. And the habitable zone, with crops and animals.  By the time I sobered up in the morning, there was only one remaining conclusion: the stones had been placed there by the same people who made this strange tube weapon. Someone on the other side of the world, in another habitable zone, just like Howell had said there would be. And I was going to find them.  Here is part 6!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,Judge_Fredd,185,Tue May 12 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"From the peak of the mountain pass, the world spread out before me. Long rows of farms, tilled and cultivated by hundreds of other Settlers just like I had been. I wondered how many of them had smoothed over the ruins of the others' work. What untold wonders waited underneath each grove of trees or row of greens?  To the left, the Star Edge loomed. I'd seen it before when I was young and we had to move the city, but I'd never been able to see over it. Most of it was entirely dark, having not been touched by light for many many harvests. The very edge was a mix of deep purples and blues, just barely beginning to freeze from as the warmth of the sun receded further and further. And with that one last look, I turn back North and away from the only home I'd ever known.  I reached the end of the pass just as the Star Edge approached in its ceaseless onslaught against the habitable zone. Even in the sunlight, I still felt the icy gusts of the warning winds which signaled to farmers near the Edge that the time to uproot had come. I wrapped myself in my cloak as tight as possible and gave the blanket to my poor horse, who had been steadfast and true even climbing up rocky and unstable peaks. If the soldiers had known what spirit this animal had, they never would have let some common settler have her. The foreboding darkness of the Night Lands loomed over us, threatening to swallow us whole if we even dared oversleep. But we soon set a north-westerly course and lost sight of the Star Edge once and for all. I was headed into the Great Desert, and would never see that frozen tundra again.  The land was wild here. Waist-high grasses populated by enormous beasts, lumbering ever forward just like us. Quickly-growing trees that would scatter their seeds at least three or four times per harvest. Or the old Hibernator trees that grew thick and strong, blooming as soon as the Sun Edge reached them and going back into their coma as the Star Edge approached. They were the only stationary species on the planet, unfazed by the icy centuries that the rest of us moved constantly to avoid.   There were few villages this far out. Though the land was arable, the mountains left settlers cut off from the rest of civilization. There was also the fear that the Sun Edge would eventually reveal a great sea or an impassible canyon that would leave them trapped against the advancing darkness. Those few who did manage to scrape out a living up here had unlimited acres and freedom from Hactran's tyranny; I briefly considered going back for Howell and Beerka, knowing that they would thrive in this frontier environment. But it was too late for that now: I was on the path to destiny.  I lost track of how much time elapsed before I came to the Ice Wastes. There were no more farms to mark the passing of the harvests. I could only guess, but it must be at least high summer now. They would begin bringing in the crops soon and clearing the way for the next planting. Up here, the ground was wet and muddy from the constant run-off of the melting Ice Wastes. Too muddy for trees to grow; there were only grasses and creeping ivies.   At long last, I reached the ice. It was a minor chunk, the size of my fist. It was less than picturesque; just a dirty lump of white among the dark brown dirt and tufts of green grasses. They became a common sight as I headed even further north, growing larger and larger until the horse and I had to snake between massive boulders of hard-packed snow and running streams.   When we reached the border of the Sun Edge and the Ice Wastes, I released the horse. With all of this grass, it would be the perfect environment. She could run free for the rest of her life. And she'd earned it. I had no way of knowing what dangers I'd face or if this part of the Great Desert was even cool enough for either of us to survive. I couldn't force the beast into that situation. I had to go alone.   With a heavy heart, I removed her saddle and loaded what remained of my supplies into my pack. She knickered softly, waiting for more instructions. I petted her on the nose and gave her the last remaining carrot; she'd been eying it ever since we descended from the mountains.   ""You can go,"" I told her, pointing at the inviting open fields. ""Go run!""   She didn't understand. She was so loyal that she couldn't fathom leaving me. I slapped her thigh as hard as I could, sending her into a nervous gallop. Once she got running, the feeling came rushing back and she danced across the plains. I smiled at the sight, hoping she'd be happy with out me weighing her down. Then I shouldered my pack and crossed the Sun Edge.  Here is Part 7!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,sittytucker,179,Tue May 12 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"I gnawed at the bone of my last bit of pork and stared out at the desolate wasteland that had haunted me for at least half a harvest. Beerka and Howell had warned me that it would be far, but I never expected this. Most of my supplies ran out long ago, and I've only managed to survive on the meager plants growing under the shadow of the glaciers on the rim of the desert. This whole journey was a mistake. I should have stayed in the North, far from Hactran's thugs but still within the habitable zone. I wondered how my old horse was doing. Hopefully enjoying freedom on the plains.   Not for the first time, I considered just walking out of the narrow band of land near the Ice Wastes and into the Great Desert. Some poor settler hundreds of years from now would find my body with this metal tube and wonder who I was and what this strange device was. Maybe he'd end up trying to find another habitable zone too, perpetuating this vicious cycle.   But in the end, I couldn't do it. I'm a coward at heart, I suppose. Either that, or stubborn: this couldn't be a waste. There had to be something on the other side. This journey wasn't just for me. It was for Gerome, whose curiosity had cost him his life. For Beerka and Howell, who had given me their hard-won supplies and sent me on my way. For my poor horse, who I had never even named. I picked myself up  and trudged along, leaning against the cool icy wall next to me. I stepped under a waterfall, feeling the refreshing blast of chilly water that snapped me back to full consciousness and refilled my water skin.   I wandered in a daze. Step by step. Meter by meter. I don't know how long I walked, but I noticed a cool breeze on my face. Not the gritty blast of sand from the desert, but the soft gentle whisper of a spring morning. I raised my eyes and saw gree. A blanket of green, littered with chunks of ice just like the area had I left. For one brief moment, I panicked: had I just done a full circle? Had I gone nowhere? But the wiser voice inside prevailed: I would have had to pass through the darkness past the Star Edge too. This was it! I'd made it. And it was... completely empty. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but I would have at least hoped that there would be some sign of civiization waiting.  There was food, though: a rambling patch of fresh berries creeping up a low hill, sweeter than anything I'd ever tasted in my entire life. It gave me the energy to head a bit further south, where I was able to find more and more food. My stomach hurt from eating so much after managing on mere scraps for so long, but I couldn't hold myself back. I crested another small hill, hoping to maybe spot some type of animal I could hunt. I still had a few pellets left, after all. But Instead, I found something different.  Far in the distance, thick black smoke poured into the sky from an enormous metal cylinder. It had to be larger than the largest building in Harka to be seen from such a distance. Behind it, a hundred similar buildings snaked across the plateau, all following two silvery lines that shined brightly in the sun.  People, I realized. The others. I was right the whole time.  With a gasp of both joy and desperation, I scrambled down the hill and toward my new home.    The end! I hope you all enjoyed the story!"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,SThor,28,Wed May 13 00:11:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for all your time and effort to entertain strangers on the internet! Your work is so much fun to read!
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,sittytucker,16,Wed May 13 05:36:42 2015 UTC,"Whaaat! Ah well, kickass story."

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,UFOtookmysheep,12,Wed May 13 01:42:49 2015 UTC,The ending makes me think of the film Snow-piercer. Good film and great short story!
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,chaltak,11,Wed May 13 10:20:36 2015 UTC,"Far in the distance, thick black smoke poured into the sky from an enormous metal cylinder.   Sounds like a Furnace industry. I wonder how they keep them moving all the time."
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,Standard__Redditor,20,Wed May 13 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"if you read the two sentences right after, it describes some sort of gigantic train."
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,Tiffany_Aching,15,Wed May 13 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I was confused about that. I thought there were two rows of furnaces.  It makes sense now. They rotate the rails from the end of Star Edge to the forefront of Sun Edge, and keep their stuff in the train to move it easily.  I would imagine that they need two tracks side by side, so that there are two trains parallel to each other. One front, and one parallely behind. They move stuff out of the front train, and live out a few harvests, while reloading the stuff back gradually into the 2nd train that is behind on a parallel track. When the star edge moves, the 2nd train is started and goes ahead of 1st train. Rinse and repeat.  Thanks for this awesome story.  If you end up revising, only thing I would suggest is that it feels a bit hasty. For example, the boy crossed the North Pole in half a paragraph. Its supposed to be an endless task where a human might come to the brink of death before luckily making it to the other side. I am spoiled by GRRM's ASOIAF. I feel that your story would be amazing if there was more mystery to it. This story needs more characters and some other POVs.  But all in all I love it. Both, the idea and the story. You did a great world building."

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,hes_a_newt_Jim,8,Tue May 12 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you do for a living, but you would probably make a lot more money by publishing your stories."
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,D45_B053,25,Tue May 12 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"I have written a book and I am going to try to get it published soon. One reason that I have reminded people to subscribe to my subreddit here (beyond the fact that I like having people willing to read my stories) is that publishers really want proof that people like your writing, especially for a first-timer like me. So if I can say, ""hey, check out these people who are following my work!"" then maybe they'll give me a chance. If that book is successful... who knows? I may be able to quit my job and answer prompts all day (and also write more books).  I also have a Patreon account but I am kind of uncomfortable asking people for money and I haven't mentioned it very much. It's nowhere close to my paycheck as a result."
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,Gramis,12,Tue May 12 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"I can't wait for you to show a publisher your subreddit only for them to exclaim, ""You're Luna!?"" And sign you immediately"

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,SOCKOx28,5,Tue May 12 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"If he's reading left to right with right as ""forward"" like we do, then reading the Sun Edge first tells him that these people have it behind them, so they must be on the other side of the world.

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,thatbelinda,5,Tue May 12 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Is the roundness of the world/existence of others a heresy in the settlement?   That's a good question.

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,paintboarder44,4,Tue May 12 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"This is awesome so far. One minor thing is noticed is:   But it disappeared into the underbrush and I lost the trail, leaving me with three fewer bullets, no dinner, an upset mob of farmers, and grape-stained hands.    He calls them bullets there and then switches back to pellets immediately afterward. It seems like that one should be pellets as well for consistency's sake."

Luna_Lovewell,35msst,turnipslop,3,Tue May 12 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to throw a wrench into things, but wouldn't the edge be moving slowest at the north pole? I'm super duper tired right now so I'm probably forgetting something. But assuming there's not axial tilt, then wouldn't the edge move slow're at the poles since there's less ground to cover and it still has to make a single rotation in a thousand years?"
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,speelmydrink,2,Tue May 12 10:01:06 2015 UTC,Which part are you refering to?
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,hes_a_newt_Jim,3,Tue May 12 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"Beerka's quote: ""Up north, near the Ice Wastes, the space between the Sun Edge and the Star Edge is very very thin. So thin that there is no space for a farm; even if you could make it into a very long narrow farm, you wouldn't have time to harvest the crops before the Star Edge passed.""  Seems to imply that the Edge is moving faster there than elsewhere, but I could be misinterpreting it. I was half-awake when I wrote my first comment."
Luna_Lovewell,35msst,ThatGuaxi,3,Tue May 12 16:20:13 2015 UTC,It's not that the edge moves faster - it's that the habitable band gets narrower the further north you go.

Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,Luna_LoveWell,32,Mon May 11 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"12 Grimauld Place was dark. It was after-hours at the museum, so I had no reason to suspect that anyone would be inside. The formerly proud home of the Black Family had been desecrated, turned into a sickening shrine to the Order of the Phoenix. Once the plan is completed, I'll have to make it clear to the survivors what happened: that their sentimental attachment to the history of their cultish Order is what brought about their downfall.  The lock was broken with a simple alohomora charm; the museum apparently didn't expect that anyone would ever break in. There were no valuable treasures inside, just relics of the war. I stepped into the hallway and cast lumos. The house was spotless, in stark contrast to the descriptions I'd read in Ron Weasley's tell-all memoir about their quest to destroy the Dark Lord's horcruxes. He'd described the place as dour and musty, tended to only by the incompetent house-elf Kreacher. Not surprised that the elf had done a poor job given Hermione Granger's pitiful attempts to elevate those beasts to human status. Why would it want to do menial labor, then?  I made my way to the living room. I bowed respectfully to the portrait of Walburga Black guarding the hall. She curtsied back with a smile, pleased to see a pureblood visitor instead of the normal stream of mudblood filth that paraded through here day in and day out. If portraits could go hoarse from screaming, she would have been silenced ages ago. A sign atop her portrait read ""Please cast muffliato charms on children before passing. Portrait may be offensive."" Sad, really: wizards today were so coddled that they needed a warning sign just to hear harsh truths about their bloodlines.  Where the heads of the Black's house elves once adorned the stairwell, the walls were now lined with portraits of the more famous Order members. Apparently honoring loyalty and service is no longer in vogue. Dumbledore's gently smiling face is the first and most visible. I sneer back at him, wishing that I could tell him how I would bring down his favorite pet. Instead, I cast an obscuring spell over all of the portraits so that they can't identify me.   Finally, I found the room I was searching for. Harry Potter had been very specific about how the room should be treated when it was turned into a museum. It should be left exactly as it was: full of Gryffindor apparel and posters of half-naked Muggle women. This was Sirius Black's room. The man who had single-handedly destroyed one of the wizarding world's most prestigious families. Only fitting that he would be the instrument of his god son's demise.   I rummaged through Black's belongings. The man was an utter slob. No wonder the house elf hated him. Letters written in a messy scrawl, old potion ingredients that turned to dust when I picked them up, old models of Muggle automobiles... This could take forever. I considered using an Accio spell, but the Aurors would be able to detect what spells had been cast in here. It was imperative that they didn't know the plan. At long last, I found what I needed: Sirius Black's hairbrush. From the pictures I had seen, it wasn't used particularly often. But it was enough: there were still a few old hairs clinging to the tines. Perfect."
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,Kiloku,29,Mon May 11 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"I added an additional scoop of lacewings to the boiling brew and stirred three times counterclockwise. Every account that I found described Polyjuice Potion as complicated, but I  never had difficulties with it. Potions had really been my best subject in school; anyone with enough brains to follow directions could do it. Thick bubbles exploded upon reaching the surface, sending the muddy brown mixture splattering against the side of the cauldron. Looked perfect to me.  I made sure that everything else was set. Once I added the final ingredient, I would only have a few hours to complete the plan before reverting back to my normal appearance. It all had to go perfectly.   I dropped the hair into the Polyjuice Potion that shimmered and roiled as it absorbed Sirius's appearance. The muddy brown liquid turned to a bright red, like fruit punch. I drank a cup full of the brew and set the rest aside. Who knows when I might need to impersonate Black again? Maybe that would make for a more dramatic announcement of Potter's death. Once it was safely stowed, I apparated away to Hogsmeade.  The stairs of the Shrieking Shack creaked and threatened to collapse under my weight. The old building, already decrepit back when Sirius Black had used it as a hideout, seemed ready to fall down at any moment. One step had already broken as I brought my supplies up. I only needed the floors to hold for a few more moments, though.  With everything in place, I made a fire in the hearth. I'd left my wand behind, so I was forced to use Muggle matches. I could almost see why Granger pitied them so much; every daily task that they did was a hassle. And it angered me even more that wizards were forced to hide in the shadows from creatures who needed separate tools for every single chore.   Warmth spread through the room, contrasting with the snows falling outside the broken windows. I leaned in close, forgetting the plan for just a second as I savored the heat. The clock struck 12, and the time had come: it was June 18th. The day that Sirius Black had fallen through the Veil.   I scattered floo powder into the fire and loudly announced Harry Potter's name and address, at the home known as the Burrow. It had taken significant bribes to get this hearth connected to the network, and a particularly powerful Confundus charm to get old Ratchford to forget that he'd made the change. The flames danced a bright emerald green, inviting me in. I knelt down before the fire and stuck my head in."
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,liehon,29,Mon May 11 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"A room appeared before me. Crowded with overstuffed and falling-apart furniture, and lit by candlelight.   ""Arthur!"" I called out as loudly as I could. I knew that Arthur Weasley had passed away years ago, but Sirius didn't know that. Nor did he know what year it actually was.   Harry Potter came thundering down the stairs and entered the room, wand at the ready. Then he saw my face in the fire.   I gasped. ""Harry, is that you? You... you're so old!"" Sirius had fallen into the Veil when Potter was just a teenager; he wouldn't expect to see him so grown up.   ""Sirius?"" Harry answered, coming closer to the fire. ""Is... is it really you?"" He was just as bewildered as I was pretending to be.  ""It's really me,"" I replied.   ""How?"" he responded. I could still see the lightning scar on his forehead where the Dark Lord had made his mark. I struggled to contain my emotions and thought about how proud the Dark Lord would be of this plan. I couldn't let him down. ""You went through the Veil,"" Harry said. ""You're dead.""  ""I'm not dead,"" I responded. ""The Veil only accepts spirits, not bodies. It sent me back.""  Harry was stunned.  ""It would be easier to show you than tell you,"" I continued. ""It brought me back to the Shrieking Shack. Come find me.""  Harry gulped nervously and clutched his wand. ""I'll be there,"" he answered. ""I just need to get dressed."" He was still in his nightclothes.   ""I'll be waiting,"" I answered, doing my best to look relieved. ""And Harry... you look wonderful. I'm so proud to see you so grown up."" I even faked a tear.  He smiled, deeply genuine. ""I'll see you soon, Sirius."""
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,TBestIG,30,Mon May 11 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"The chilling silence of the Shrieking Shack was interrupted by a loud CRACK from outside. Right on time, I thought. I glanced out the window and saw eight wizards in Auror uniforms running into the building. They thundered up the stairs, and I was pleased to hear one of the steps collapse under the force of their charge. They burst into the room wands drawn. Before I could even utter a word, one of them shouted ""Expelliarmus!"" Just as I suspected they would. It's a common Auror practice to disarm a suspect before even ascertaining the threat level. But I had no wand to disarm.  Harry Potter entered the room. His Aurors fanned out in a circle around me, wands still raised even though they knew that I wasn't armed. They each held up purple objects that looked a bit like Globes. Sneakoscopes, tuned to detect evil intentions. This had been the most difficult part of the plan: mastering Occlumency. I would never be near the Dark Lord's level of power, but I had practiced to the point where the most powerful Sneakoscope would be unable to read me.  ""Harry, what is this?"" I asked. ""Who are these people?"" Sirius wouldn't know that Harry Potter was now head of Magical Law Enforcement.   ""Aurors,"" he answered. ""I'm sorry to have to do this, Sirius. I know you dislike Aurors after how they treated you."" He was of course referring to Sirius's arrest for the Twice Traitor Peter Pettigrew's murder. Harry turned to one of his agents. ""Where is his wand?""  ""No wand, sir,"" the Auror answered. Harry Potter would probably have recognized Sirius's wand, too. ""He was unarmed.""  Harry breathed a sigh of relief. If it were a trap, I would need a wand to hurt him. Right? ""And the room?""  ""No runes, charms, or any other trap that we can detect, sir. No spells cast here in the past month. And the Sneakoscopes come up empty. He seems legitimate, sir.""  Harry Potter looked directly at me. I could sense the pain in his eyes. His regret over losing Sirius was well-known throughout the wizarding world, and the fact that he blamed himself for the loss. That was why I had decided to impersonate Sirius in the first place: to ensure that Harry Potter would be off-balance. Maybe even bring back his reckless, impetuous side.   ""Sirius,"" Harry said, ""If it's really you, we need to be sure."" From his cloak, he withdrew a small crystaline bottle full of perfectly clear liquid and slid it across the warped wood floor toward me. It came rolling to a stop against an old couch cushion nearby. ""You need to drink this."" Veritaserum, of course. Standard tactic for a high-level Auror interrogation. Guaranteed to make anyone tell the absolute truth. Well, anyone who wasn't prepared, at least.  I picked up the bottle and removed the tiny stopper. Looking Harry straight in the eye, I downed the entire bottle. My stomach rumbled slightly as the bezoar I'd swallowed soaked it all up. They were normally used for poisons, but were just as effective against any other magic potion.   He waited for a minute, maybe giving it time to take effect.   ""Are you really Sirius Black?"" he said at last.   I looked him straight into the eyes and broke into a broad grin. ""Of course I am,"" I responded. He sobbed and ran forward, wrapping me up into a tight hug. ""I can't believe it,"" he whispered into my ear with tears streaming down his face.   You shouldn't, I thought to myself as I patted him on the back."
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,kilkil,23,Mon May 11 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"""How is this possible?"" Harry asked. The other Aurors around the room lowered their arms and retreated to the doorway to give us some private time to talk.   ""I don't know,"" I told him. ""One second I was in the Ministry, dueling Bellatrix. I stumbled backwards, and into the Veil. And I was trapped in this odd.... it was almost like a train station, if that makes any sense."" I'd heard that bit from an interview Potter gave, in which he claimed that Dumbledore had given him advice. ""And the next second... I was here in the Shrieking Shack. I came out of this arch."" I pointed at the stone parabola that I had secretly constructed at the end of the room. I'd even hung a tattered curtain in the center to make it more like the Veil inside the ministry.   Harry studied it closely. ""It's just not possible,"" he whispered. ""Dumbledore told me that you were dead...""  I laughed. ""Harry, Dumbledore may be the greatest wizard alive, but even he doesn't know everything. Even with all of our knowledge, we still don't quite understand everything about death just yet. Inside the Veil, I felt... out of place. Something inside me said that I didn't belong there. That I was still corporeal, and that the Veil was only for spirits. Kind of like a ghost, but the opposite.""  Harry nodded. It made enough sense that he was willing to buy the story to have his Godfather back.  ""It spit me out here. I didn't really know what year it was, but I figured that if any of the Order members were left, they'd be at the Burrow. So I tried calling Arthur, and I guess... I guess that's when I got a hold of you.""  Harry nodded. This was everything that he'd wanted. The Veil had always been so mysterious that he always thought maybe there was some chance. He'd kept the pieces of that old mirror over his mantle for all these years hoping to someday see Sirius's face again. And here 'I' was!  ""This,"" I said, gesturing at the arch behind me, ""is some kind of counter to the Veil. If that was the 'Entrance' to the afterlife, then this would be the 'Exit.' Come look at these runes along the side; they call it the 'Ghost Arch.' I think that this might be how ghosts are able to resist the call of the afterlife. But there are some markings that I don't recognize. Do you know anything about Runes?""  ""A bit,"" Harry answered, taking a step closer to the arch. The light was dim enough that he wouldn't be able to tell that the stones were practically new and the mortar was freshly set.   ""Right here,"" I pointed at the apex of the arch, high enough that he'd have to get close to read them. He took another step forward.   ""Do you see it?"" Harry nodded affirmatively. ""Do you know what they mean?""   The Boy Who Lived took another step toward the arch. ""This rune here,"" he said, pointing to one particular marking, ""means 'revenge.' I saw it on a case I worked up in the Scottish highlands.  ""Revenge,"" I repeated, moving closer to see over his shoulder. ""Yes, that's exactly what it means.""  I placed a hand on his shoulder, then reached forward and grabbed the arch. I felt the all-too-familiar feeling of being hooked like a fish, somewhere behind my navel. Harry's eyes opened in fear as he looked up at me just at the last minute. He felt it too, and knew exactly what was happening. He had been kidnapped with a portkey before. It was the most satisfying moment of my life so far.   ""Yes,"" I said, responding to his unspoken question. It was all I had time to get out before we vanished from the room."
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,fb3playhouse,28,Mon May 11 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"We landed in a graveyard.   Not the graveyard, of course. The one where the Dark Lord had been reborn and dueled Harry Potter after the Triwizard cup. I had considered hosting this little party there, but I figured it was too recognizable. That's the first place the Aurors would look once they realized that I had used a portkey, just like Barty Crouch. I wanted this to be a reminder for Harry, but at the same time, I wanted to be able to take my sweet time. So, I picked a different graveyard. It would have to do.  I grabbed my wand immediately. It was carefully secured on the closest headstone near the landing site, and it was there waiting for me. I'd practiced this so many times that I was immune to the dizzying effects of Portkey travel. Before Potter had even gotten up from the fall, I was able to recover my wand. And the first thing I did was destroy the Portkey; I'd learned from the Dark Lord's mistakes. The stone arch shattered into a thousand pieces and showered us both in dust.   He tried to Apparate away immediately. I only laughed. ""Anti-apparition Rune, Harry. Just like Hogwarts had."" I shot a stupefy spell straight at him, and he barely managed to dodge out of the way. I hadn't expected it to work; I was never an amazing dueler, especially against an experienced Auror. I just needed to keep him distracted for a while. Chase him around the graveyard for a bit.  He dodged behind a mausoleum and sent a spell flying around the side. It didn't come anywhere near me, but I took cover nonetheless.  ""Who are you?"" he shouted.   ""No one you've ever heard of,"" I responded. Running was not in Harry's nature, and doubly so if he needed to learn more about his opponent. He'd never leave here if he didn't know who was after him. He needed my identity to protect against another attack.  I scampered down the rows of graves until I reached the particular section I was looking for. Statutes of the dead loomed out of the mist, and I took cover behind a particularly large and ornate grave of one Thorfinne Rowle, a Death Eater who had been shamed multiple times by Harry Potter. He'd be proud to know that even in death he was serving the Dark Lord's cause. I sent a spell flying in Potter's direction and taunted him just a bit: ""Or would you prefer that I maintain the charade of being Sirius Black?""  That got the reaction I'd expected. A red curse flew out of the darkness and struck Rowle's grave, cracking the jet-black stone. Harry came running out of the darkness, lips bared. He'd been regarded as the undisputed master of the duel for so long that he had forgotten what danger could be. He'd forgotten that dueling was not the be-all and end-all of wizard defenses. He had gotten sloppy.  The statutes around the graveyard sprang to life and closed in around him. He fought them off, crumbling some of them into dust. They felt no pain and advanced anyway, driving him toward the crumbling ruins of the church beyond. As the last statute fell to the ground missing its limbs, the true trap was activated. The Devil's Snare wrapped its tendrils around his ankles and wrists and pulled him into the mass of green hiding in the shadows. He writhed in its grasp, apparently not recognizing the plant or not remembering that the harder you struggled, the tighter it held.  ""Expelliarmus!"" I shouted triumphantly, knocking the wand from Potter's grasp and sending it clattering against the worn bricks of the church. The duel was finished."
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,SparroHawc,24,Mon May 11 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"""Don't you recognize it, Harry?""   He was still fighting the plant as though he could escape just by trying hard enough. He didn't respond to me, just grunted as he strained against the vines curling around his waist and up his arms.   ""Devil's Snare. You've encountered them before. Don't you remember your very first year, when this was guarding the Sorcerer's Stone?""  He stopped struggling. Apparently he did remember.  ""All coming back to you now, right? It avoids light and heat, but struggling against it makes it grip tighter. A shame that you didn't remember all of that when you still had your wand!"" The Dark Lord would have wanted Harry to know what was coming. To recognize his downfall.   ""You see, Harry, I figured out your strength. You are not the bravest, or the cleverest, or the most powerful..."" Those all described the Dark Lord. ""But you do have allies. That is how you have made it this far. When you first stopped Professor Quirrel in your first year, you only did so with the help of your friends. You had Hermione by your side to tell you how to escape the Devil's Snare, didn't you? But now you're alone. And alone, you are nothing.""   I gestured around the graveyard. ""Let all of this be a reminder. Everything I am using today are things you have faced before. Polyjuice potion, portkeys, the Devil's Snare... all things that you were only able to overcome because of your friends. Every peril you faced, you survived because you had someone else there to help you, or some magical intervention that you didn't even know about. Some of them even died for you, with the misplaced idea that you were something special worthy of their sacrifice! One would think that you guzzle down Felix Felicis like it's pumpkin juice!"" I laughed at my joke; Harry did not. ""Oh, come now. You're going to die anyway. Might as well enjoy what little life you have left.""   ""I'm not alone,"" Harry grunted. The Devil's Snare was snaked around his lungs, squeezing the breath out. ""The other Aurors will come find me. Or Ginny. Or Ron and Hermione!""  ""They won't,"" I assured him. ""I have placed every possible protection on this place. It's harder to find than Hogwarts! You have no idea how long I have been planning this, do you?  I picked up his wand from the ground; it felt warm in my hand, the way that only my own wand normally felt. I could feel its power coursing through me. He saw me holding the wand, and the last bit of hope left his face.   ""Kill me, then,"" he told me.  I smiled back. ""In due time, Harry."""
Luna_Lovewell,35lxhk,Stoic_stone,39,Mon May 11 19:15:50 2015 UTC,"The moon came out from behind a cloud as I prepared the summoning ritual; the graveyard was bathed in an eeie bright light. The Dark Lord had been able to do this spell with a simple press of his Death Eater tattoo, but I was nowhere near that powerful.   I didn't expect too many to show. Most of them were old and buried, or living out the rest of their lives in self-imposed exiles away from the Wizarding community. Some of them, though, yearned for the old days. Though it had been short, there had been a time when they were untouchable gods, protected by the fearsome reputation of their leader. When they'd been able to use muggles as they pleased, rather than hiding from them and treating them with kid gloves. Those few who remained had passed on their traditions to their children, in some cases even continued the tradition with the skull-and-snake tattoos. Those are the ones who would answer the call. Others would soon flock to our cause once they learned what I'd done.  Fifteen minutes passed. They would have never kept the Dark Lord waiting for so long. If you didn't arrive within the first few minutes, you were better off not coming at all, unless you had a particularly valid excuse. I had removed the apparition-blocking rune, but only for a limited time. And it was coming to a close. I had only removed it for this one particular area too: I couldn't risk allowing Potter to escape. Even safely secured by the Devil's Snare, I was not convinced. I'd used petrificus totalus, just to be sure he was stuck. And lastly, I'd used a binding spell, wrapping him in ropes until he looked like a mummy. He wasn't going anywhere.   A hooded figure appeared. He nodded to me, thinking I was just another Death Eater who had arrived earlier. He was scanning the graveyard, looking for any sign of the Dark Lord. So many had seen him fall at the Battle of Hogwarts that most believed him truly dead. But the true believers would never be 100% convinced that a being of such power could ever truly die, even with his Horcruxes destroyed.  More and more Death Eaters appeared in between the headstones until we numbered nineteen. More than I had expected, but fewer than we'd hoped.  ""Where is the Dark Lord?"" one finally asked.   ""I am the one who summoned you,"" I finally volunteered. ""The Dark Lord remains dead.""  There was muttering in the crowd. They thought this was some type of test.  ""But we can carry on our work in his name!"" I shouted over the murmurs. ""We can do what needs to be done to rescue out society from the Muggles! We can take back our birthright and assert our dominance over their society!"" There was a chorus of cheers. ""And it all starts tonight. Follow me.""  I led the way to Potter, still safely trapped where I had left him.   ""Fellow Death Eaters, you all know tonight's guest?""   There were hisses of hatred. They had seen this all before, and knew how it ended for the Dark Lord. Involving Potter was a curse. I quieted them once again and produced a dagger from my robes.   ""This is the silver dagger that Twice-Traitor Peter Pettigrew used to restore the Dark Lord to power. We know that Harry Potter has no protection in his skin against this weapon, unlike the killing curse."" I held the blade aloft for all to see. ""Pettigrew used it to cut through Potter's skin to draw blood for the ritual. But then the Dark Lord foolishly..."" I was cut off by whispers of disagreement. Who dared call the Dark Lord foolish?! ""Yes, foolishly! The Dark Lord was proud, and it led him to make mistakes! He was powerful and mighty, but not flawless. If our movement is going to move forward, we must recognize this!"" There was silence among the spectators. They may not agree, but they were curious to see what would happen with Potter.   I turned back to him, still wrapped up in vines. I blasted the plant with fire, and it dropped him to the dirt and shrank back to the shadows. I didn't want it to grab me too.   ""The Dark Lord foolishly let the Potter boy free, even after retraining him. He wanted to kill Potter in a duel, for an honorable death. I will make no such mistake. Potter deserves no honorable death.""  I turned back to Potter and raised the knife... and slid it across his neck. Blood gurgled out of the wound and dripped into the grass. I plunged the dagger into his chest, just to be sure. And Harry Potter died.  As his eyes glassed over, I felt an earth-shattering pain. I was being ripped from limb to limb, set on fire, and drowned all at the same time. The dagger in my hand seemed to grow heavy, just as the spell described. The dagger had absorbed part of my soul: it was a Horcrux now. I fell to the ground, barely managing to maintain consciousness.  The others were breathless. They never thought this day would come.   I managed to control the pain and got back to my feet. ""Brothers,"" I called out. ""Potter is dead, just as I have promised. But this is only the beginning! We have much work to do before we can truly consider ourselves worthy of the Dark Lord!""  There was a chorus of cheering and applause. They cast spells at Potter's lifeless corpse, tossing it around the graveyard and making it dance on headstones.   ""And you, my lord?"" one of the Death Eaters interrupted the celebration to address me. ""Who are you?""  I hadn't really thought about that. I'd been focused so much on the plan to kill Potter that I hadn't thought about what I would do after.  ""You can call me... the Dark Apprentice."" I answered.    If you made it here from /r/Writingprompts or /r/HarryPotter, I hope you enjoyed the story enough to subscribe to my subreddit here!"

Luna_Lovewell,3524b9,Sohprotem,3,Thu May 7 02:03:52 2015 UTC,Because he felt betrayed by God. If you know your boss is trying to get you killed you quit.

Luna_Lovewell,34y5hh,genericpierrot,5,Tue May 5 18:10:08 2015 UTC,I'm always disappointed by the cliffhanger stories. They have a really interesting build up to this big finale and/or twist and I can't wait to read what's going to happen and then the text just ends before anything is resolved. It seems to be a consistent theme in /r/WritingPrompts though. Sadly.

Luna_Lovewell,346n8d,Luna_LoveWell,153,Tue Apr 28 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"I failed my mission. General Hammond entrusted it to me and me alone, and I failed. I am writing this letter hoping that someday it will be preserved in a museum. When the Hunters come, history will vindicate the Bonaparte name.  The plan was simple: the Hunters had been preparing their invasion for hundreds of years, so why shouldn't we? Knowing what we know now, we could go back in time and unite humanity. Forge society into a might hammer to be wielded as one instead of the loose confederation of squabbling states that we have now. We had the machine to do it, and we just needed to pick the right time. The answer was obvious: The Second Dark Age.  France had erupted into revolution, and the monarchy had fallen. Notions of fraternity and equality had quickly gone out the window in the ensuing struggle to take the reins of government. Soon, scholars and scientists came into question and fell under the blade of the guillotine. And the revolution spread like fire, consuming all of Europe. German states dissolved into all-out civil war, and England followed suit after Ireland and Scotland rose up in unison. It even spread to the Islamic Ottoman Empire, and from there to the Far East. Trade was curtailed, men were pulled from colleges to enlist in the army, and society regressed five centuries in only a few years. Hammond enlisted me to stop it, by whatever means necessary. End the revolution before it spreads, and unite Europe to prepare for the greater threat.   Seizing power was surprisingly simple. I stopped the loyalist uprising that overthrew the National Convention, and used that to worm my way into the government hierarchy. The people were looking for anyone who had the vision and determination to rebuild the nation, and I was that man. I was the only one doing it for the good of the world, not for my own selfish ends. And the people could see that.   France itself was in bad shape. The revolution had utterly destroyed society, and it could not be resurrected with cannons alone. I established laws and rebuilt infrastructure. I created a national identity and restored national pride. The country became strong again, and then we were ready to begin spreading order to the surrounding nations. Rival kingdoms, of course, played right into my hands. I smashed their forces one by own, creating the largest empire since Rome. Europe was falling even faster than expected, and I began to make my plans for the rest of the world. Russia would be the perfect bridge to bring Asia under my fist. Those British remained a thorn in my side, but I could deal with them later.   And that's when things fell apart. Russia did not accede to my demands like the other nations had. How could they not recognize progress when it's right in their face? How could they stare down defeat and burn their fields in answer? They were madmen! I invaded further. Their armed forces were smashed, but they refused to surrender. They simply retreated further, turning their entire country into a scorched wasteland. I threw more and more men and supplies at the problem, knowing that Russia would be the key to success. Even after Moscow's fall, they refused to join the cause. Faced with the collapse of all I had built, I retreated. I could always return for Russia later; the mission was too important for this one battle. Defeat came cascading down, one loss after another. The nations that I'd worked so hard to build turned on me, unappreciative of all of my work in their favor. I should have just waited till the revolution spread to Britain and Russia, and then conquered them. They deserved to burn.  Now, I rot on this island, Elba. The British navy is parked off the coast, just waiting for an excuse to kill me. Well, I'm going to give them one. I didn't come back 300 years just to end my crusade in a dark cell. Tonight, I will slip off this island and return to France, where my people await me. I will kill this Louis XVIII with my own bare hands if I have to. The mission is more important than even my own safety.   Should I perish in the attempt and be forgotten, let this letter serve as a reminder that at least I tried my best to unite Europe and prepare for the Hunters. Hopefully even my small impact will be enough.    If you're enjoying all of this alternate history, you should also check out the book I'm writing about Rome never falling. And you should subscribe here to my subreddit!"

Luna_Lovewell,33pzpk,NormalNONdoctorHuman,-13,Sat Apr 25 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"You don't have to continue everything, but a lot of your stories you seem to purposefully leave with an unsatisfying end, to where it almost sounds like a long extension of the prompt itself, rather than a story. If you don't want to continue something, don't set yourself up for it."
Luna_Lovewell,33pzpk,Irishczechmate,14,Fri Apr 24 22:15:39 2015 UTC,That's rude and unfair. I'm sure she writes them as if she can continue them and does so according to how much time she has and which she likes the best. It's absolutely childish to chide someone who gives us so many lovely responses to so many prompts. This isn't her job. It's her art.
Luna_Lovewell,33pzpk,Pikalink1,12,Sat Apr 25 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I came across as rude; I didn't mean to. I agree that her writing is fantastic, and I didn't want to sound negative at all. I simply feel that a story with an ending included occasionally would at least be something interesting to try, and can often be better than leaving it open ended. Some prompts(and I'm not necessarily even saying this prompt) are better left with a simple answer instead of a multi part saga. Not that I don't like the sagas, I'm simply trying to help with some friendly advice. :)"

It depends somewhat on the size and style of a publishing house. She will work with lots of authors who have very specific wishes as to the layout and cover, which are often fulfilled. But just as often, her boss just grabs an image he likes and decides that's how it's going to be. It's a small publishing house though, and I know that in bigger publishing houses the author often has less control, both in terms of cover art and typesetting. I would say that a lot depends on the size of the print run. If they aren't even doing it offset, you could probably ask for whatever you want. But if it's a bigger printing run, they will want to make sure that your cover is as good as it can be. If that means rejecting a substandard cover (not implying that it will be, but we're speaking hypothetically here) then they absolutely will.

Luna_Lovewell,32t7w2,Audysseus,2,Thu Apr 16 17:13:04 2015 UTC,Right. I guess the better way to phrase it is that I didn't base the story on an existing planet or civilization from the Star Wars EU.

Luna_Lovewell,32owo5,Indie_uk,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"Minimum viable population:       Minimum viable population (MVP) is a lower bound on the population of a species, such that it can survive in the wild. This term is used in the fields of biology, ecology, and conservation biology. More specifically, MVP is the smallest possible size at which a biological population can exist without facing extinction from natural disasters or demographic, environmental, or genetic stochasticity.  The term ""population"" refers to the population of a species in the wild. For example, the undomesticated dromedary camel is extinct in its natural wild habitat; but there is a domestic population in captivity and an additional feral population in Australia. [clarification needed] Two groups of house cats in separate houses which are not allowed outdoors are also technically distinct populations. Typically, however, MVP is used to refer solely to a wild population, such as the red wolf.

Luna_Lovewell,32m8ub,Luna_LoveWell,248,Tue Apr 14 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"""Mr. Miller to the Principal's office,"" the PA system announced. ""Mr. Miller, please report to the Principal's office.""  I set down my coffee and looked up from my book. If I get disciplined for lettting that class out early, I thought, then that's it. I'm quitting. I don't need this job. Around the teacher's lounge, my colleagues were giving me curious looks. Teachers rarely got summoned by the principal. What next, detention?  ""OOOOH,"" Coach Paul joked, ""Someone's in trouble!!"" The others laughed. I flipped him off and grinned as I walked out the door.   As I walked through the locker-lined hallway, I practiced all of my excuses. I had a headache. The projector malfunctioned and I couldn't get it to work. We finished our chapter early. A student presentation was canceled. They all might do in a pinch, but I wasn't really happy with any of them. I was so busy coming up with explanations that I didn't even notice the black rolls royce parked by the flagpole. First mistake.   I waved to the receptionist at the front office and headed into Principal Neilson's office. To my surprise, two men in expensive-looking black suits were already seated at the principal's desk. I stood in the doorway, a bit dumbfounded. I guess it wasn't about letting the class go early. I should have just turned around right then and there. Should have run out of that office, gotten into my car, and found another town. Mistake number two.   ""Ah, Sam,"" Principal Nielson greeted me. ""Come in on. Please meet Mr. Altringer and Mr... Wegleitner? Am I pronouncing that correctly?""   The two men stood from their chairs in unison and turned toward me. They looked like they had just walked out of a GQ magazine. Ruggedly handsome features, stylish haircuts, and just enough stubble for that carefully maintained 5 o'clock shadow look. Not to mention the fine suits and expensive shiny shoes. What would bring men like this to a public high school in Iowa? That's what I should have asked myself. Mistake number three.   ""These two gentlemen have taken an interest in your career, it seems. They are recruiters for a private highschool in Chicago, and wanted to speak to you."" Mr. Neilson seemed impressed; probably because my class test scores were nothing amazing, and I'd only been at his school for a few years. Why would a private school be recruiting me?  Mr. Altringer extended a hand, and I knew the reason why. His shirt cuff rode up just a bit, exposing a detailed tattoo. It showed a large hammer, like Thor's. Behind that, an ornate cross. And wrapping around all of that, flames that licked at the base of his palm. The Order of the Hammer, named so for their strict adherance to the Malleus Maleficarium: ""The Witch's Hammer."" Basically, the Church's guide to torturing and murdering anyone suspected of witchcraft, blasphemy, or even just criticizing the church. I fit squarely into all three categories.  ""Mr. Nielson, do you mind giving us the room?"" Wegleitner asked. He made no efforts to disguise his thick German accent despite pretending to be from Chicago.   The Principal wasn't accustomed to being asked to leave his own office, but did as he was asked and closed the door gently on his way out.   ""So you go by Miller now,"" Altringer said. We'd never met before, but he must have taken over the case from the last group of Order acolytes who had been stalking me back when I was in California. He didn't wait for a response: he pulled a knife from his jacket pocket and slit my throat.  I sighed (which made a weird gurgling sound with my trachea split open) and waited for the wound to heal up. There was no gush of blood or painful death; that's not how my body functioned anymore. I may have all of the same parts, but I don't need them in working order like a normal human. My throat sealed closed like a zipper.   ""So, I take it you haven't figured how to undo the spell yet.""  Altringer looked at the knife, disappointed. ""Damn. Thought that might have done it.""

I'll absolutely be continuing the story. And speaking of which, I forgot to add the link to my post with all of my multi-part stories. Thanks for reminding me!   Any update on the availability of your book?   Unfortunately, no. I'm editing it more and looking for an agent. I thought that writing it would be the hardest part, but it seems like the process of trying to convince someone that it is worth reading is 10x more difficult."
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,batcrab,2,Tue Apr 14 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Are you not considering self publishing on Amazon? It seems like you've already convinced thousands of people to read your writing.   Given your self generated audience I'm surprised you want to worry about jumping through all the hoops of finding an agent and publisher. Hire an editor and a professional cover designer and give us the book! :P  But then again, I'm no expert and I'm sure you've considered all the options. Thanks again for all the wonderful stories!"
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Tesabella,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good job at the moment, but I would love to eventually make a career out of writing. So at this point, I think it would be best for me to go through traditional publishing so that I can try to learn the ropes and see how things are done before striking out on my own. Maybe once I have some books on the shelves and people recognize my work a bit more, then I could self publish."
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,SantasBananas,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'm sure you'll be able to find a publisher for your work. I guess I don't like the idea of the publisher having control over the work and taking such a large cut of the profit. But, if they get you in the stores it's probably worth it.  Best of luck!"
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,SantasBananas,4,Wed Apr 15 18:00:22 2015 UTC,Good. I just opened up a fortune cookie that didn't have anything inside of it.  I'm a bit concerned.
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Ballem,4,Tue Apr 14 16:53:50 2015 UTC,They just wanted you to enjoy the cookie all in one bite without having to worry about the paper inside.

Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Ballem,3,Wed Apr 15 01:44:56 2015 UTC,Hey Luna.  Today I'm in school reading reddit instead of paying attention.
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Cubevision,3,Tue Apr 14 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what kind of prompts are the ones that catch your attention?"
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Cubevision,2,Tue Apr 14 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"Hard to know, really. I just read the titles and hope that some sort of idea comes out. I can usually at least get started on most prompts, but making a complete story doesn't always happen. I browse writingprompts looking for ones that don't have any comments yet. Those are the ones that will likely get popular, but also I don't like writing ones where there are already a lot of answers. I feel like reading other people's responses before writing mine will influence my work to be more like theirs, and I don't want that."
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Cawendaw,3,Tue Apr 14 18:59:57 2015 UTC,Do you like the prompts that are super detailed or the ones that are very simply and allow for a lot of writer's choice?  I've seen this point debated many times.
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,Darathrius,3,Tue Apr 14 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"I like the ones that give a lot of background details and set up the scenario, but don't try to set up where the scenario should go. The details give me a good basis to create the world around but still let me decide where to take it from there. But detailing how the story should go is just a big turn-off. I want to come up with it myself, not narrate what the OP wants to hear."
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,aadharna,3,Tue Apr 14 19:17:25 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Any specific genres catch your attention?
Luna_Lovewell,32kmlu,aadharna,3,Tue Apr 14 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"Not particularly. You can see all of my past prompts here; I don't think any one genre is predominant.   I don't think I'm very good at prompts that would want a humorous response, so I don't do those too often."

They tell you that your grades matter so much and that where you go to college will determine your job and your entire life, and all that. It's not true. Where you go to school matters a lot less than what you get out of it. So, enjoy your time now (reasonably; I'm not saying fail all your classes) without worrying too much about the future."

Luna_Lovewell,32080n,Lord_Pudge,9,Thu Apr 9 16:40:16 2015 UTC,My class in high school (Lutheran hs) said that being away from god was meant as being away from anything with his influence or any good qualities. So basically darkness and nothing forever. I'm not much of a believer anymore but that did stick with me
Luna_Lovewell,32080n,coderman9,6,Thu Apr 9 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know about you, but that seems pretty hellish to me."
Luna_Lovewell,32080n,Impetusin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:35:03 2015 UTC,So basically hell would be like the earth.  I suppose you could theoretically worship God from hell.  Maybe you'd just forget God and found your own religion.  I guess I'll go blind if I stare into the proverbial religion Sun too long.
Luna_Lovewell,32080n,coderman9,1 point,Tue May 12 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"Hemenemeh. It depends on who you ask. Some (C. S. Lewis for example - actually Devo too now that I think about it, but they didn't mean it quite the same way) say that yes, hell would basically be earth, and over time we'd just get tired of being good and break down and get on each others nerves, and we'd slowly devolve into literal hell on earth. Some others (Lutherans I believe) say that it means being away from everything that God has had an influence on - i.e. everything good. I'm not entirely sure you'd actually be able to worship God from hell, it's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if you'd be able to realize the divinity of God when he has no influence on you. I think you might definitely end up worshipping something else, though, you're right. I encourage you to do 'stare into the religion sun' - you might find something worthwhile."

If you don't mind my asking -as I'm sure you probably are asked quite frequently- how do you choose what prompt to write for? Do you just pick one and force yourself to think of something? Do you know automatically where you want to go with a prompt when it catches your eye? Or do you have to sit and think it over before you write? The prompts you choose are always varied and your stories flow so well you make it look easy.

Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,Luna_LoveWell,464,Wed Apr 8 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"I woke up to the sound of swishing waves brushing loose sand. Bright sun filtered through the thatched palm fronds above me. I tried to sit up, but all my muscles were like rubber.  ""Don't try to move,"" a voice warned. ""The effects will wear off fully in just a few minutes.""  ""What happened?"" I asked. It was maddening to be unable to see the speaker. ""Where's the plane? Where are we?""  ""Don't worry about that for now,"" the woman reassured me. ""We'll explain everything in time.""   I tried to get back up again, managing to move one shaky arm to support myself. I was in some kind of field hospital with white cinderblock pillars, concrete floors, and open-air windows with a magnificent view of a pristine tropical beach. There were dozens of beds on either side nearby, all full of sleeping bodies. I swung my legs over the side over the edge of the bed and promptly vomited onto the floor.   ""A common side effect,"" the woman reassured me as she offered a towel and patted me on the back. It was the same airline attendant who had slipped me the bottle of vodka.  ""Where are we?"" I repeated. She sat next to me and glanced around to make sure no one else had woken up. I took a closer look and realized that most of them passengers on the plane. The fat man who'd blocked my path into the aisle was slumbering three beds over.   ""An island off the coast of Puerto Rico,"" she said. ""Isla de Mona. They tell everyone it's a nature preserve, but it's not. Think of this as Guantanamo Plus. A high security prison. Completely secure, and isolated from the rest of the world.""  ""I didn't do anything!"" I told her. A prison? I thought to myself.  ""We know you didn't,"" she said. Her hand dipped into one of her many pockets and withdrew a photograph. ""He did.""  I recognized the man. He'd been sitting just a few rows up, and had definitely walked past me to go to the bathroom at one point. I'm good with faces. She spread out six other pictures, and I saw that every one of them had also been passengers.  ""They were planning another suicide-style attack, this time against the Fontana Dam up in North Carolina. They learned in Iraq that dams are both vulnerable and destructive. Fontana Lake, for example, contains millions of gallons of water that would have torn apart every town its path. Destrution in the billions of dollars, not to mention the damage to the electrical grid.""  ""Why the gas? Why not just arrest them and be done with it?""  She gave a familiar smile. I wasn't the first passenger to ask that same question.  ""Have you ever heard of the Enigma Machine?""  There was some movie about it, I vaguely recalled. I'd been more interested in my date's cleavage than the actual plot. ""Somewhat,"" I answered.  ""Enigma was a German code,"" she explained. The practiced answer probably didn't change much regardless of how much the person knew about it. I wondered just how any planeloads of people they'd already done this to. ""And the British managed to crack the code during World War II. But they had to keep it an absolute secret, or else all of that work was for nothing, right? The Germans would just change the code the next day, and they'd have to start from square one.""  I didn't see the connection.  ""In order to keep it a secret, they had to do... terrible things. They had to let their own soldiers die. And even innocent civilians. They had to let German attacks happen, so that the Germans wouldn't suspect that their communications were being intercepted. America is in the same position. If we let them know that we have sources inside the organization, then we could lose all of our intelligence. Getting human operatives inside Al Qaeda has been the CIA's most difficult task to date, and they're not about to reveal that source.""  ""So we were the sacrifice,"" I concluded. She smiled broadly and nodded. She had cute dimples.   ""Yes.""  From a nearby table, she picked up a newspaper. The latest Washington Post. The cover was dominated by an aeriel photo of smoking wreckage strewn over a mountainside. Supposedly our plane.  ""So what now? Now that they think the plane crashed, what do we do? When do we go home?""  The smile vanished, and she turned away to check on another passenger.  ""Tell me when I can go home!"" I insisted.  She looked back with pain in her eyes.   ""You can't,"" she answered. Her tone was firm and commanding, masking the pain that she must have felt every time she had to answer that question.  I didn't even comprehend at first. My jaw dropped.  ""Everything will be explained in time,"" she said. ""You need your rest.""

Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,intangiblesniper_,27,Wed Apr 8 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you see The Imitation Game, you'd realize that part of the story is inaccurate. The Germans did change the code, every day. That was the problem: figuring out the new code every day. What Benedict Cumberbatch Alan Turing did was build a machine that broke the new code every day.  Still, a great story :)  Edit: OK, even my explanation wasn't accurate. Enigma is (was) a machine, not a type of code. The machine had many different settings (around 159 million according to the movie), each of which would produce a different encoded message when the original was passed through it. It was these settings that changed every day. The machine that Turing built would, given a message with some known words and using the fact that no letter was ever encoded as itself, figure out what settings were in use on a given day.  Here are two excellent videos on how enigma worked and how it was cracked. The movie is more about Turing himself, and doesn't do the best job covering Engima. These two videos from Numberphile cover that aspect better."
Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,icosahedron14912,15,Wed Apr 8 03:37:07 2015 UTC,What?  That's covered fairly extensively in the movie...
Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,Essenzay,6,Wed Apr 8 03:45:30 2015 UTC,"The inaccuracy was that Alan Turing was not actually the one that made the machine that cracked open Enigma. The machines they show in the movie is called a bomba, which was first created by the Polish in 1938, if I remember correctly.  Alan's contributions at Bletchley Park helped redesign the bomba and made it more efficient, which significantly improved the effectiveness of the system."
Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,Jesin00,6,Wed Apr 8 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"Indeed, Marian Rejewski and co. were the first ones to crack Enigma, intercept German messages in real time, and analyze the intelligence gained to suit Polish needs. The problem was that the PCB simply didn't have the capacity or funding to construct enough bombs to decode the entire day's traffic."

My only quibble was that in the movie, they made out that the thing that let them break the Enigma's codes was some kind of genius spark of inspiration. In actuality, they'd figured out they'd probably use that method of cracking it from day 1 of the project; the spark of inspiration was how they used the method that was identified in the movie, which is in many ways more fun :D"

Most of the reports of him that people know about were written after his suicide, so they show him in the best light they can. The reports written during his life indicate he was largely considered a relatively nice guy (or at least not deliberately being an arsehole), but useless with people and completely and utterly obsessive with his plans. He would requisition things that others needed, then when the papers didn't go through fast enough would just take them and be damned. He would ignore work, sleep and food to work on his projects. He would completely ignore the chain of command if he didn't think it was appropriate for his goals. Guy was a nightmare to work with in a military institution."

Luna_Lovewell,31thu6,buonanottemom,2,Wed Apr 8 12:23:59 2015 UTC,"U-571 (film):       U-571 is a 2000 war film directed by Jonathan Mostow, and starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Thomas Kretschmann, Jon Bon Jovi, Jack Noseworthy, Will Estes and Tom Guiry. In the film, a World War II German submarine is boarded in 1942 by disguised United States Navy submariners seeking to capture her Enigma cipher machine.  The film was financially successful and generally well-received by critics in the USA  and won an Academy Award for sound editing.  The fictitious plot attracted substantial criticism since, in reality, it was British personnel from HMS Bulldog who first captured a naval Enigma machine (from U-110 in the North Atlantic in May 1941), months before the United States had even entered the war. The anger over the inaccuracies even reached the British Parliament, where Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the film was an ""affront"" to British sailors.   The real U-571 was never involved in any such events, was not captured, and was in fact sunk in January 1944, off Ireland, by a Short Sunderland flying boat from No. 461 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force.  U-571 was filmed in the Mediterranean, near Rome and Malta.     Image i     Interesting: German submarine U-571 | Convoy OB 318   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Luna_Lovewell,31vpvq,ForlornCreature,13,Wed Apr 8 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question!  It's hard to answer, though. I'm not a real author. I haven't taken any writing classes or studied Literature or anything like that. So I don't really know how to describe what I do.  Usually I will start with a little nugget of an idea and just see where that takes me.  As an example, I'll use the book that I'm working on. The idea started with seeing a picture of a big metal door in the side of a mountain surrounded by a forest. And so I started thinking ""Well, what would be behind the door? What are they doing in there that can't be done in a normal building? Why under a mountain in a forest?"" That line of thought made me think of some clandestine political meeting, like organizing a coup. And that kind of merged with another school of thought where I was thinking about an enlightened dictatorship and how that could ever possibly be established without bloody wars of succession. And that made me think about Rome's former practice of sometimes appointing someone like Cincinnatus as a dictator when necessary.  So the idea then merged into a version of Rome that would choose a leader not based on who was the Emperor's son, but picking an absolute leader based on his/her qualifications in a big secret bunker under a mountain. And that idea was in my mind when I saw the prompt about writing about a modern Roman Empire.... and that's it.  I know that this doesn't help very much. So all I can really say is that you need to take that little bit of an idea and just think it over. Think about how that would affect people and places. If the idea is ""the first colonists land on Mars,"" then think to yourself: why are they colonizing Mars? What's wrong with Earth? Who are these people specifically and why did they get picked? What's Mars like now? Is it terraformed yet? And once you have thought about the setting, then that could lead you to a plot. Maybe they're political dissidents fleeing some authoritarian government on Earth, and being pursued. Maybe they are refugees, being dumped on Mars because Earth is overcrowded, so the story will focus on them trying to make a life with less-than-adequate resources.  That kind of thing.   I'm really rambling now, so I hope that helps and I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you might have."
Luna_Lovewell,31vpvq,Luna_LoveWell,2,Wed Apr 8 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! It's cool to see how your train of thought and curiosity blends and matches ideas to create something new. Also, I wouldn't discredit you for the fact that you haven't been formally trained - experience is the best teacher. A majority of the best filmmakers never went to film school; they just kept making films.  So before you actually start writing, do you outline your story? Do you know where it's going to end, or do you just start writing and see where it takes you?"
Luna_Lovewell,31vpvq,Luna_LoveWell,3,Wed Apr 8 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"So before you actually start writing, do you outline your story?   No. Some authors do, but that's just not my style.  The closest I come to outlining is that sometimes I will stop at certain points and leave a little note to myself that says ""come back and write more about X."" That's what I do when I get writer's block and would rather just move on to something else.    Do you know where it's going to end, or do you just start writing and see where it takes you?   Usually the latter. Sometimes I have a vague idea of what will happen, but that changes a lot. The ending of my book is practically unrecognizable from what I thought it would be, but the feedback on the ending has been superb from the people editing it, so I am happy to have made the changes I did."
Luna_Lovewell,31vpvq,Luna_LoveWell,2,Wed Apr 8 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"That is really interesting. Coming up with your story on the fly sounds dangerous (but also rather exciting).

Luna_Lovewell,31vpvq,Luna_LoveWell,2,Wed Apr 8 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how much time I have at work that day, and also depends on whether I like the prompts or the story that I'm working on. But I at least spend a few hours each day."

The survivor's story is gripping in and of itself, but you took it to another level by giving the real story internally. It added an emotional depth to a character in an action paced tale.

Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Luna_LoveWell,892,Tue Mar 31 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"We made it out of the city, thank god. The cab dropped us off at the airport, and I exited so fast that I didn't even bother counting how much money I gave him; I just threw a wad of cash through the window. At the ticketing counter, the airline attendant was confused: ""What do you mean, you don't know your destination?"" I only had a split second to think: where would we be safe? Where would the plague not go?  I picked Denver. I figured that we'd be able to find a little place in the mountains somewhere and hide out until this whole plague blew over. Some rich man's ski cabin that he never used, isolated enough that we wouldn't encounter another soul, and far enough from any cities that may be bombed. We'd find the right place, stock up on some supplies, and just never leave.  Sarah tried to talk some sense into me while the airline attendant prepared the tickets. ""Honey, do you really think this is a good idea? You haven't even told me why we're taking this impromptu trip, and you didn't even know where we were heading?""  ""You just need to trust me,"" I answered. It was all I could tell her. I glanced around the terminal, a sea of purple and green. She needed to trust me.  ""I'm not getting on that plane without an explanation,"" she said, raising her voice a little. The airline attendant looked over the counter suspiciously, and I saw her eyes dart over to the security desk. I took a deep breath and tried to put on a smile.  ""Honey, I really need you to just believe me, OK?"" I leaned in close to whisper. ""Something very very bad is about to happen, and we need to be somewhere else when it happens. Anywhere but here.""  ""What is it?"" she asked. ""How do you know?""  I couldn't tell her the truth. She'd think I was having a breakdown; she already was thinking it. I wasn't so sure she was wrong. But if I told her that a big sign with everyone's cause of death was floating over their heads, she'd have me committed. She certainly wouldn't be getting on the plane. And that wasn't a risk I could afford to take.  ""I just know,"" I answered. ""The same way that I knew you would eventually overdose in college."" Her jaw dropped like I'd slapped her across the face. We hadn't really talked about her battle with her pill addiction and the other demons she had fought, at least not in a very long time. Back in college, it took months of work, and she still fought the urge even a decade later. But I had always been there for her. And I'd also never explained why I asked her out in the first place; I just brushed it off by saying I saw her across the quad and thought she was hot. But getting her on the plane was important enough to bring it up. ""That's why I talked to you that day we met. that's why I asked you out. Because I knew you needed help. Just like I know that we need to get on that plane.""  She was too shocked to speak. She just nodded in agreement and squeezed my hand. The attendant printed out our tickets, and we rushed to the gate. As we ran, I checked her sign, just to be sure. Still ""dementia.""  The plan would work."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,bumbo__tumbo,824,Tue Mar 31 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"It's been four months, and I was right about everything. We witnessed it all go down from our cabin in Colorado, just outside of a little town in a little valley that you've never heard of. Every night, Sarah and I would sit at our kitchen table with a cup of hot tea and catch the radio broadcast. She likes to rest the cup on her swollen belly; she thinks that the heat is comforting to the baby.   We listened as cities fell like dominoes. New York was first, as expected. The broadcasts claim that that was the epicenter of the infection. With how crowded the city is, almost no one stood a chance against it. Unless you could have seen it coming, that is. The city was bombed roughly three weeks after the epidemic was recognized by the CDC. They just couldn't quarantine a city that big, and there was no way to stop the steady stream of refugees. It's a slow infection, you see. The government says that you can carry and spread it for up to a month before ever seeing any symptoms. Sarah and I have been in the cabin long enough to know that we're fine, but she was certainly worried for a while. I knew that we would be fine, because her sign was still the same. The ""Dementia"" hovering over her head was comforting to me now.  We made a life for ourselves. I'd bought up truckloads of supplies that first week, maxing out all of my credit cards and filling the car to the brim with every load. Not like a debt collector would ever be coming after me. We'd inventoried everything once the plague started radiating out from Denver and we decided that that would be the end of the supply runs. It was too risky to head out back to population centers. There wasn't much left, anyway: we weren't the only ones hoarding supplies anymore. It's been months since we've seen a soul, and we've got at least 9 months of food left. For the first time in a long while, I feel hopeful. I think we can ride this out.  I've become a bit of a mountain man, myself. I even grew the beard to match. Not what you'd expect from a city boy like myself, but I'd adapted, you know? I needed to. Sarah needed me to. The baby was coming along now, leaving Sarah pretty much incapacitated. It was October, and the first snow would be coming soon, so I was chopping firewood as quickly as I could tear down the trees. Had to get everything ready.  After a few hours, I headed back inside and took off my gloves. My hands were sore and red; I still hadn't really built up those good lumberjack calluses. Sarah was reading in bed, under a thick stack of blankets. Today was particularly cold, and I'd spotted some clouds moving in. Weather forecasting is one of those things that I never thought much about until I really needed it.   ""Can we have a fire?"" she asked with an overly dramatic shiver. I'd said no over the past two weeks; not enough firewood, and it would be too easy to spot. Anyone wanting to steal our supplies could find the cabin. Sarah thought that was ridiculous, but I wasn't taking any chances. I'd seen enough apocalypse movies to know that other humans were the biggest threat. I wanted to wait until the first snow; that way, at least they'd have a hard time reaching us. But I couldn't say no to her, especially with the baby on the way.  ""I'll fetch the wood,"" I responded. She smiled and managed to climb out of bed to give me a warm hug. I felt her belly pressed against mine, and couldn't help but smile even with everything going on around us. At least we had each other.   I came back inside with an armful of kindling and logs and got to work. I lit the match and watched the old newspapers go up in flame, eventually catching on the larger sticks until it spread to the logs. The cabin was immediately twice as warm, and ten time cheerier.   I turned back to her with a proud grin on my face. She smiled back... until she noticed my reaction. My expression of utter horror.  Her ""Dementia"" sign was gone. It was replaced by an orange banner that read ""Gunshot wound."""
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Scrub_Printer,734,Tue Mar 31 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't know what to do. I couldn't breathe. My mind was racing.   ""What is it?"" Sarah asked. ""Is it the sign over my head?"" There was a touch of panic in her voice.  I'd explained it all, after the plague hit. I could finally tell her everything. About the day that we'd met, about my ability, about seeing the ""plague"" and ""nuclear explosion"" signs everywhere. She listened calmly and accepted it. It was unbelievable, really, but what other explanation was there? How else could I have known about the plague?  I couldn't answer. My voice wasn't working. I could only nod. She bit her lip and tried to look brave.   I doused the fire, but that was a bad idea. It just sent up a massive puff of smoke that would be belching out the chimney. I might as well set off some fireworks and erect billboards with directions to our cabin. How could I have been so stupid? I had no idea how many survivors were out there, or what the world was like. And with the winter coming, there were probably a bunch of them looking for somewhere safe. Maybe they'd even be infected! We didn't know much about the outside world anymore; the radio broadcasts had stopped about a month ago, replaced with just an ""emergency warning"" signal that repeated over and over again.   Sarah stood by the bed, not sure what to do.  ""Honey,"" I warned her, ""I need you to get in the cellar."" It was only half-dug, but it would be big enough for her to hide in. She was too scared to argue with me.  ""What does it say?"" she asked as she stepped onto the ladder leading down. ""What's the cause of death?""   ""There won't be one,"" I reassured her. I leaned down for a last kiss, trying to hold back tears. After she descended, I covered up the entrance with a rug and slid the table over it. It looked out of place in the center of the cabin, but I doubt any murderous looters would be concerned with the feng shui of the home. They'd head straight for the shelves of canned goods. It was the best I could do.  With Sarah safely tucked away, I turned to the enormous chest at the foot of the bed. I hadn't needed to open it in the four months we'd been hiding out here, but I knew the day would come. I tore the lock off and creaked the heavy cover open and studied the array of weaponry. My mind flashed back to the gun owner's face when I came in and practically cleaned out his shelves; said he'd never seen anyone buy so many weapons at once. It had taken him all afternoon to properly log all of the purchases. I'd also met up with a man outside Boulder who'd procured some less-than-legal items; that was the second-to-last supply run I'd ever made, but it was a necessary one.  I strapped on the bulletproof vest and carried as many weapons as I could outside. Just for good measure, I locked the door behind me. Not that it would make much of a difference; if they got to the door, that would mean that I was dead, and a lock wouldn't do much to stop them. I surveyed my surroundings, silently cursing the smoke still trickling from the chimney. The woodpile would make a pretty decent barricade: porous enough to see and shoot through, but thick enough to offer me decent protection. And it was stacked in such a way that I had a clear view of any cars coming up the rough dirt road that led into the cabin. I hunkered down in my position and stacked the boxes of bullets nearby for easy access.   I finished settling in just as I heard the roar of engines approach as the cars traversed the switchbacks up the hill."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,StevandCreepers,1138,Tue Mar 31 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"There were four SUVs, covered in dirt and dust from a long trip on the road. And the bullet holes in the side made it clear that I wasn't the first survivor that they had raided, nor was I the first to put up a fight. Hopefully I would be more successful than their last victims, because I had a secret weapon.  Four men emerged from the first car, guns already out. These guys didn't play games, and they certainly didn't look like they were willing to negotiate. No matter, I knew how to handle them. Over their heads, aqua-colored signs floated that said ""Grenade."" Twelve more men piled out of the rest of the cars, four in each. They wore hooded sweatshirts and military fatigues, and carried rifles, shotguns, and pistols. A tall man in sunglasses and a baseball gap gestured with his hands, and they closed the car doors silently and came into a huddle. There were some more aqua-colored signs, and the rest had orange ""Gunshot Wounds"" signs. Just like Sarah's, I thought with a shiver. I had been wondering whether I should try to warn them or threaten them somehow, but this cinched it: they weren't planning on giving me a chance to surrender, so I would show them the same courtesy.  I imagined Sarah huddled in the dark cellar as I pulled the pin from the grenade, counted for two seconds, and lobbed it into the center of the group. One of them saw it coming, I think. His chin lifted for just a moment as it sailed through the air. I watched his cocky smirk shift to surprise, and he was just starting to open his mouth when it exploded.   Nine of them were on the ground, from what I could see. I had gotten lucky that they were all bunched up together, even though it hadn't landed right in the center. Some of the nine bodies were moving still and one was struggling back to his feet, so I wasn't that lucky. The rest of them reacted almost instantly, ducking into cover behind their cars and around the edge of the cabin. I chucked another grenade out, but my aim wasn't as good this time; I only caught one in the blast zone. That was the last of the aqua-colored banners; using any more grenades would be a waste. The rest were still marked with orange ""gunshot wound"" signs, which I took as a good omen.  I poked the rifle between two logs and took aim. They still didn't know exactly where I was hiding, and I managed to pop one right in the head as he was searching for me. The others caught on soon enough, and peppered the woodpile with bullets. Pieces of bark and splinters flew through the air, and the logs shook violently with each impact. Maybe this wasn't as safe as I thought. I did my best to fight back, but had a hard time getting a clear shot. I just sprayed bullets at them without looking to aim; I figured that statistically, I'd at least thin their numbers before they rushed me. We exchanged fire back and forth, and I was happy to see their numbers dwindle.  ""Cover me,"" one of the remaining thugs shouted. I peaked around the side, hoping that they'd be watching the top of the pile instead. I managed to catch a glimpse of the leader, still in his baseball cap but missing his shades, make a run for the cabin door. A hail of gunfire made me pull back just as he jumped up onto the patio. I poked my head up and caught one of the others right in the chest, and he went down. On the porch, the splintering sound of wood drew my attention, and I saw the remains of the door hanging from the hinges. The leader had already made it inside, and the other two who were still standing were heading that way. I managed to gun down one more, but the second made it inside.   I scrambled away from the woodpile and ripped the shirt off one of the bodies nearby. I waved the shirt through the doorway threshold like I was in an old cowboy movie. Immediately, shots rang out, and bullets whizzed past and slammed into the dirt driveway; they were watching the door. I went back to the pile and grabbed a log, and tossed tit through the entrance, then raced over to the kitchen window. Behind me, they were firing into the doorway, expecting me to come through. I caught a brief glimpse of them both standing in the center of the room before I smashed the window pane and blew them away with two shotgun blasts. They each crumpled to the floor in a pool of blood, and the cabin fell silent. Four months of target practice out here had definitely paid off.   I limped back inside, noticing the bullet in my thigh for the first time. When had that happened? No matter; we had a medical kit, and it wasn't life threatening. I rushed over to the center of the room dragged the table out of the way. ""It's me,"" I called out as I  opened the trap door. Sarah was cowering inside and squealed in fear when it first opened, despite my warning. But when she saw me, she exhaled in relief and began to cry. She slumped against the wall, body wracked with sobs. I climbed down in and put my arm around her, holding her close. I'd defended the cabin, but it wasn't enough. We cried together; she was crying with joy, but I was heartbroken.  I helped her climb out of the basement; she was still shaking with terror, and couldn't stand to look at the bodies, but we didn't have time to clean them up. I tried to tell her what happened, but I couldn't find the words. There were none. I couldn't even look her in the eyes. I did my best to comfort her, even as I sobbed. She didn't understand, and I didn't have the heart to tell her.   The stress from the gunfire and the explosions had done it. She noticed when she felt the sticky wetness under her dress, and her hand came up covered in blood. Not mine, hers. Her sign no longer said ""Gunshot wound."" I'd at least managed to change that much. But it wasn't enough: the sign was now a dull ochre color, and said ""Childbirth.""     She gave birth later that night, about three weeks early. There was so much blood, and I didn't know what to do. I was an accountant, not a doctor! I'd read all the books about giving birth at home, but that always assumed that things went well. And assumed there would be a doctor nearby to assess any issues. She squeezed my hand as she pushed, and cried as she fought the pain. I pulled him out and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, overjoyed with my new baby boy. He was perfect. She sobbed with joy as she held him, and fell asleep cradling our child. She never woke up again.   I looked down at the little guy with a smile, despite all that had happened, and stared at the grey sign floating over his head. It said ""Old age.""   We were going to make it.     The end! I hope you liked it!! This was a lot of fun, and I am happy with how this story turned out.  Now for shameless plugging:    You should subscribe here to my subreddit here: /r/Luna_Lovewell. I write stories every day, so there's always more for you to see. If you particularly like these longer, multi-part stories, you should check out this list of all of my multi-part stories!. Tons of reading material for you! I am writing a book! It's an alternate history where Rome never falls. You can read more about it (and the first chapter) here, and if you want me to tell you when it's out, just leave a comment! And if you're rich and have nothing better to do with your money, consider supporting me on Patreon? I'm kind of new at it (just started a few days ago), but I'm writing another story there: Pharaoh Meryhathor."

Well done Luna! Though I felt like the end was a tad rushed, I need to remember this is a writing prompt. Under that premise, this ended off quite wonderfully. If only this was turned into a novel! ;)  You definitely have a reader for life."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Pamplemoussaurus,39,Tue Mar 31 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"Though I felt like the end was a tad rushed, I need to remember this is a writing prompt.   I agree. I just had trouble writing the ""reveal"" of her sign changing. I might go back and change it if I can improve it."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,UselessMerchant,49,Tue Mar 31 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would be interesting to let the guy notice that her sign changed, but don't tell what it changed to. The ""She fell asleep""-sentence would be a lot more powerful that way, in my opinion.  Still well done, though!"
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,William_gfl_gfs,9,Tue Mar 31 20:47:53 2015 UTC,Ooh I like that
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,rockinghard,35,Tue Mar 31 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about where you were going with this story, ranging from super happy to super dark, where not only is her cause of death ""Childbirth"" but the baby's is something like ""Starvation.""  I think this strikes the best balance of the bittersweet with the hopeful.    You are clearly very talented.  I'll be donating to your Patreon soon. :)"
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,nrs877,44,Tue Mar 31 19:50:56 2015 UTC,I couldn't kill the baby! I'm not a monster.
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,ThiefofNobility,24,Tue Mar 31 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"Ending it on ""starvation"" wouldn't mean the baby dies, just that it will if MC doesn't find a solution. It leaves open the possibility of a continued storyline, and keeps consistency with your established world. Ending with assuming ""old age"" means the child will make it is inconsistent, since we have already experienced these signs changing. There is no established reason to believe that the ""old age"" sign will last.  Good story nonetheless. :)"
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Gilthwixt,27,Tue Mar 31 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome work! I thought as soon as the gunshot popped up, it was going to end up being him that shot her. But I like this ending too. You rock!"
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Nerdtendo,17,Tue Mar 31 19:57:42 2015 UTC,Here's the rest of your 100$/month goal! Keep up the amazing writing.
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,ror6y,12,Tue Mar 31 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for writing this. Absolutely loved it. The whole time I was reading, I couldn't get over how haunting the lack of a timeline was for the ability. In this last section, all I could think of is what things would be like if the group was actually looking for survivors to bring to their settlement with them and our ""hero"" murdered them because his power made him misinterpret their intentions. I'm not sure if it was intentional also but when Sarah's phrase changed to ""Gunshot wound"" and our main character soon after pulled out a gun, I dreaded where you may have been going."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,ZeroRhapsody,12,Tue Mar 31 19:59:31 2015 UTC,Dammit. That managed to be heartbreaking and happy. This was a great story.

Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,QuarterLifeCrisis-,13,Tue Mar 31 18:35:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! It's hard to just write without planning out how the story will go.
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Vorian23,9,Tue Mar 31 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"I've never really considered myself to be a reader, which is why I often visit /r/writingprompts; creative ideas woven into beautiful short tales able to grab my short attention span, long enough for me to read the entire story.  After I discovered your stories upon joining reddit (maybe less than a year ago), I've always felt a bit of giddiness when I saw your name in a interesting writing prompt (most recently the harry potter and the forgotten house).  That said, I have never wanted a short story like this to turn into a novel so badly; I'm a big sucker for romance, and the main character doing everything in his power to keep his spouse (and future child) alive is - in my opinion - a fantastic read every time.  In these short few posts, you've made me connect with the MC and want him to survive more than any other literature/game out there in a long time.  Just wanted to say thank you and keep going! Your work is incredible.  I was wondering if there was an option (doesn't have to be patreon) where I could donate a lump sum? My financial situation isn't good enough for me to be able to predict my monthly expenses, so I'd very much rather give you a large amount now while I'm doing well than pledge for a monthly donation, only to find that it would run into my budget :\"
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,360qucikSCOPE,4,Tue Mar 31 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"I don't have a way to do a one time donation; I should. But in the meantime the Patreon website says that you can just cancel it any time, so you could let it run up till tomorrow (it collects donations on the 1st of the month) and then cancel it."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,S_cute,7,Tue Mar 31 19:17:09 2015 UTC,The fact that publishing companies aren't throwing wads of money at to you write for them baffles me.

Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Downten,42,Tue Mar 31 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"No problem!  When I started it, my primary rule was that I would never start a story on /r/writingprompts and then start charging people to continue it. I think that is just awful, because there is nothing worse than stopping a story halfway through. I would hate myself for doing that, and I would expect you all to hate me too.  So the only patreon-exclusive content will be stuff unrelated to /r/writingprompts. The Pharoah Maryhathor story is just one that I have been thinking about for a while. I will absolutely continue writing this Plague story and many others for free. I enjoy writing, and I don't mind doing it just as a hobby. But some users have asked for some way to support me, and if I could make a career out of writing, I feel like I owe it to myself to at least try."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Zackypooh,21,Tue Mar 31 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. There was a guy in /r/nosleep who wrote out like a 9-part story, and then ended it on a really dramatic part with a plug to his book on Amazon.  I'll never forget that cheated feeling."
Luna_Lovewell,30xnrr,Kejii,21,Tue Mar 31 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That is just misleading, in my mind. I'd rather write a story with an ending that is good enough to make readers want more."

But I'm a terrible editor, so I sent it to four other people to read over and give suggestions. After that, I plan on trying to find an agent and selling it to publishers.  I would love to eventually become a full time writer, but I'm not at a point in my life where I can quit my job and take a risk on a whim, you know? I don't have any training as a writer, and I've never actually published anything. But if I could do this kind of thing full time, that would be amazing.   Plus I would answer like twice as many prompts if I didn't have a day job."

From the research we did when my wife wrote some non-fiction books, this is much better than what you'll get from publishers and the market is bigger.   For reference, we made about $3700 last year from three books written in December 2013. This was with no previous audience and selling the books for 2.99.

Luna_Lovewell,30ur2b,Luna_LoveWell,2,Mon Mar 30 21:41:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who adores your work, but is also strapped for cash like a horse by saddles (college student), I can't help but think that the sight should have let you create tiers: for 150 you do x pages; 250 y pages; 750 z pages.  Basically sells novels to an already fairly high traffic author. Would be much more effective at putting money mostly where it should be. Let's not forget that the twilight series was something a larger number of us than will answer truthfully have read once. But even then, if any author in question dunked really hard on the return, it would get broadcasted so hard. Much sales, such publishing, wow.  Which leads me to a mildly personal question: DOES LUNA_LOVENEVILLEWELL has contracts? Geeeet soooomeee  edit: parentheses  edit 2: other stuff"

Luna_Lovewell,30hoxp,Luna_LoveWell,164,Fri Mar 27 13:54:19 2015 UTC,"""The new God."" It sounds utterly ridiculous to say it out loud, but I had absolutely no doubts that it was true. I mean, it's kind of hard to argue with a booming, disembodied voice that had created a skyscraper from my LEGO design.   ""So, anything I create can just become real?""  ""Sure,"" God answered. ""Give it a try.""  I moved to the bins and started to snap some simple pieces together. ""So, you made the universe with LEGO? That seems kind of unusual.""   ""No, no,"" God laughed. ""I just needed a good way to explain it to you and to get your attention. I knew you'd connect the dots and make your way to the tower. And it's a good explanatory tool. Something you're familiar with, you know? When I was chosen to be God, my predecessor had to explain it using clay, because we didn't have cool toys like these."" I worked on my model while he spoke. ""Man, that was one ugly clay giraffe! But I got better. Just like you will.""  I finished. Just a simple car; nothing too complex.   ""Great!"" God said encouragingly. ""Now, just make it real. Picture how everything would turn out. The color of the wheels. The size of the door. Sunlight sparkling off of the windshield.""  I closed my eyes and concentrated. ""Just do it"" isn't particularly helpful advice when you don't know how to make it real. But I tried. I could smell the leather interior. I could feel the rubbery grip of the steering wheel under my fingers. I could hear the throaty roar of the engine. I could see the waxed sheen of the cherry red hood. And when I opened my eyes, a full-sized car was waiting in front of me.  ""There you go,"" God said as I ran to the car and climbed into the driver's seat. ""You've got the hang of it!"" But the car was not exactly as I'd imagined; the same color and general shape, but not quite right. The smooth curves that I'd imagined were blocky squares. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. And the car didn't start; probably no engine.  ""A craftsman is only as good as his tools,"" God warned. ""LEGO is fine to start you off, but soon you'll graduate to better building blocks: atoms. And your designs will get more and more intricate, planned down to the most miniscule detail."" The car suddenly roared to life, and the hood became transparent, showing the motor throbbing. ""You'll need to plan out what goes under the hood, not just the superficial details."" The blocky squares of the car changed into the smooth curves that I'd envisioned. The leather seats became soft and cushy underneath me. ""And finally, you'll need to find a place in the universe for your creation. It needs to be part of the system, not a standalone. Food, predators, mates... everything it would need to live on its own."" The bins of LEGO pieces disappeared and the room around me shifted and changed into an highway; I was surrounded by other cars sailing past that disappeared as soon as they hit the room's wall. It was an eerie reminder that I was still trapped inside the mysterious tower.  ""But what will I be creating? It's not like there are that many new species popping up on Earth...""  ""Who said anything about Earth?"" God answered mischievously."
Luna_Lovewell,30hoxp,imthescatguy1,124,Fri Mar 27 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"A layer of cholesterol, some interlocking lipids, a few protein channels in between... It all fit together perfectly. I was able to see everything fall into place like an enormous puzzle, with each different compound corresponding to its neighbors in perfect harmony.   ""Good,"" God told me. ""Now wrap it all up.""  I took the cell wall that I'd crafted it and folded it all around the other organelles that I'd put together. It was carefully arranged into a tight little package. I watched with wonder as everything sprang to life, each serving a unique function in the cell. I'd just been following the recipe, but my chest still swelled with accomplishment as I observed the miniscule mitochondria generating energy for the rest of the parts; those little buggers had been the most difficult part.  ""You've created life,"" God said. He sounded like a proud dad sending his kid off to kindergarten. ""That's it. You've passed Level One. You are now a master of creation.""  I stepped back from the cell, which floated in the center of the room. It had been magnified while I worked on it, and was now about the size and shape of an old bean bag chair. I'd been so engrossed in my work that I'd forgotten about everything else in the world. I hadn't eaten, or slept, or had anything to drink, yet I was strangely alert and satisfied.   ""How long have I been working on this?"" I asked God. ""What time is it?""  God said nothing.  With a sudden rush of realization, I remembered Dad and the general waiting outside in the truck. They must be worried sick! Building that cell must have taken hours; they probably thought I was dead by now.  ""God, this took forever! My dad is probably freaking out!""  ""Ah yes,"" God said vaguely. ""That's an excellent segue to the next level: Time. It no longer exists here. You ask how long it took to make that cell? There is no answer. Outside this tower, your father has just dropped you off only seconds ago. And at the same time, it's been so long that his ashes, and those of everyone you ever knew, are now scattered to the wind. When you step out that door, it will be whatever time you want it to be. Just as you are now able to tell matter how to be, you can also tell it when to be. Go on out the door and try.""  I left my new cell floating in the room and headed outside. The first thing that I noticed was a blast of muggy heat from the jungle. Inside the tower, it was hard to remember where I really was. The second thing I saw was the bright full moon. It was night; that shouldn't be the case. I concentrated, just as God had taught me to do when Creating. The sun floated back into the sky, rising from the West. It looped through the sky until it became a bright yellow blur. The blur slowed to a crawl as I reached the right day, and the humvee carrying my Dad crept back up the road in reverse. Finally, I reached the appropriate moment: ten minutes after I'd gone through that door. Time began to flow the right way again.  ""Dad!"" I called out. He was so relieved to see me, and I suddenly realized that he thought he was sending me to my death, just like the soldiers who had disappeared into the tower. He leaped from his seat and wrapped me up in a hug.  ""What did you find in there?"" the General said, interrupting our moment. I ignored him.  ""You have to say goodbye,"" God told me. Dad didn't react at all to the booming voice; neither did the General. ""You have a higher purpose.""  ""Dad..."" I started, not quite sure how to say it. ""I need to go back inside."" He nodded understandingly, not really grasping what I was saying. He didn't know that I wouldn't be coming back out. I returned to the doorway and picked up the LEGO tower that I'd brought with me.   ""Where are my men??"" the General shouted at me. With a wave of my hand, a column of uniformed troops poured out of the doorway behind me. That should keep him busy.  ""Dad, take this."" I thrust the model into his hand. ""And don't worry about me. Everything will be OK.""  Tears welled up as he realized what I was saying. ""You don't have to..."" he started to say. But I shook my head. ""I do. You won't understand, so just don't try to stop me."" God must have done something to influence him, because he didn't try to hold me back. He just pulled me in for one last hug and told me he loved me. I walked back to the door as he waved goodbye.  I watched them all drive off from a window that hadn't been there before. The general and Dad seated in the humvee, accompanied by me.   ""The human part of you,"" God explained. ""This version of you will remain with your family. No one will even remember the goodbye. As far as your Dad knows, he has his son back. And soon, the Lonely Tower will be forgotten too.""  I nodded. The goodbye hadn't been for Dad's benefit.  ""Come,"" God told me. ""It's time you learned about Level 3."""

Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,fuck--knuckle,8,Fri Mar 27 00:46:49 2015 UTC,That's true. I just added it to the rewards for $1 pledges. Thanks for the suggestion!
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,buddythegreat,7,Fri Mar 27 00:47:50 2015 UTC,"No problem, happy to help."
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,alexanderpas,2,Fri Mar 27 00:51:48 2015 UTC,"Just ask them for a name. They can provide their own name if they are comfortable or they can make up a pseudonym. Of course give yourself the option to decline a ""name"" just in case someone wants to try and pawn off something offensive as a character name."
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,akkashirei,16,Tue Mar 31 18:25:35 2015 UTC,You are not accepting money for nothing...  You are getting paid to write.  Congrats on making this small but important step.
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,akkashirei,5,Fri Mar 27 10:34:28 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,tomo_yea,14,Fri Mar 27 12:46:03 2015 UTC,You could do a prompt lottery. Every month you pick your favorite.
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,Johmpa,12,Fri Mar 27 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"So, donors would say ""Write a story about X"" and I would pick which one?  That is pretty easily doable. Good suggestion!"
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,Vorteth,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:45:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it's what I would do :D
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,ski14hs,11,Mon Mar 30 03:27:22 2015 UTC,You could possibly give people a special icon on the subreddit depending how much the pledge?
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,Vorteth,7,Fri Mar 27 03:56:51 2015 UTC,I can do that!
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,love_butter,11,Fri Mar 27 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'll be happy to support you doing this.   The fact that you're hesitant to accept money for your work is actually inspiring. But be that as it may, you're still effectively doing work for us for free. Just because it's something you love doesn't mean that you don't deserve recognition and support from us for doing it. A lot of us are probably enjoying reading it as much as you do writing it, without having to invest anything for it.   So you're certainly not taking money for nothing. You're allowing us to show our appreciation in more than just words.   As for possible reward tiers, how about a separate Writing Prompt pool for patrons, or even some small measure of commissioned work?"

Another user just suggested that, so I added those as rewards just a moment ago. At $3, users can see any Patreon-only stories that I write, and at $5, users can suggest the prompts that I'll use for Patreon-only stories.  The only rule there would be that I don't want to be continuing stories that started on /r/writingprompts. I don't like the idea of writing something and then getting halfway through and asking users to pay to see the rest. I'd rather it all be on Patreon from start to finish.   And thank you very much for your support!"
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,Awesomesparky,2,Fri Mar 27 12:53:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Making them pay only after starting would be rather messed up.   Glad you see that :-)

Maybe you could put links for an easy download that will be more readers friendly than the current writingprompts format?
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,Swolo,5,Fri Mar 27 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"Hey Luna, love the writing. As a suggestion for your patreon account: at the end of your stories when you link your subreddit, link your patreon as well if you are comfortable doing that. That will help give it visibility for people who are not subscribed to your subreddit."
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,KeyboardKlutz,5,Fri Mar 27 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd be comfortable doing that. I'm uneasy with the whole idea as it is, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm only writing so that people will support me there. I'm doing it because I enjoy it, and I'll do it for free. Linking to it would only take away from the story and turn away people who don't know me, I think."
Luna_Lovewell,30fjq8,IscoAlcaron,3,Fri Mar 27 14:37:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand that. At the very least put your link in your sidebar if you haven't already.

Luna_Lovewell,30db7k,Johmpa,2,Thu Mar 26 14:15:45 2015 UTC,Why not look at making a website and a patreon account? I imagine quite a few people would be willing to pay you a couple bucks a story/month to support you.

Do I want to hear how the humans took our place among the fit? Or do I want to sit here, marvelling that you made me feel the need to go to war with these species. Fighting tooth and nail to conquer it all, make them our pets and lab animals. Watching other planets surrender out of fear for what we might do to them. You made me feel all this in the equivalent of a few pages. I wish I had a spark out of the fire of creativity you have roaring within you. Well done Luna. Well done."

Say you were on the council, and you wanted to make a hole so you could take her spot. For that you need a patsy, someone that's killed before and has an obvious motive that would get him arrested immediately - happily, as a judge Wan had plenty of those. So you meet him, show some forged evidence blaming her, and give the man a gun. Now you've got a perfectly disposable killer, one that'll get out, do his job and be taken back. He won't even be pissed off or talk, since he'll think he's got justice.  And that's why you set up men like him in advance. They're such useful idiots..."

They just blew up our drug lab... they infiltrated dressed in giant chicken costumes there to sing for Ruiz's birthday!... poor Ruiz...not too smart, good fighter though... he loved chickens...""

You cannot come back from what you have just jumped into, but you must find your way back to your original setting by finding a painting that resembles the setting of your original era and using your new found ability.  Thus you would go through a chain of paintings into different settings and eras trying to find a painting that somewhat resembles the time and place of the art museum that you were in at the beginning of the story.  The choose your own adventure would be choosing which frame/medium to jump head-first into.  You cannot jump into paintings that you have created, but I think it would be really interesting if you could jump into paintings that were created by talking to famous artists and convincing them to try and draw a specific setting."

Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,Luna_LoveWell,382,Tue Mar 17 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"""What are they?"" I asked. My nose was practically touching the monitor as I watched them pace through the office, leaving a trail of shedding skin on the hardwood floors. Like snakes.  ""We call them Vampires,"" Morgan said. I turned back; my eyes must have gone wide, because the agent gave a soft chuckle. ""No, your coworkers aren't Dracula,"" he explained. ""No bat wings and garlic allergy. We only call them that because of how the parasite is transmitted: the potential host has to drink the blood of another infected person. A lot of it. They usually lure the victim with a sexual relationship, tie them up, and then force the person to drink the required amount."" God, Amanda and I were supposed to go on our first date tonight.   ""Somehow, the organism survives stomach acid and gets absorbed in the small intestine, and makes its way to the brain from there. The full gestation period takes about a week, leaving the victim almost comatose. The parasite lives inside the host for roughly six weeks before physical transformation can begin. Normally they cover up their true appearance with a layer of the host's skin, but when they're getting ready for a fight..."" He gestured at my former colleagues on the screen, now covered in bronze-colored scales.   The beast that had been Mike was now rifling through my desk while ""Amanda"" was looking through files on my computer. Both of them had been out sick for a week a few months ago, and then Sarah was gone for a bit too right after she started dating Mike...  ""Where did they come from, though?"" One of the EMTs handed me a cup of tea, and I realized that my hands were shaking too hard to even hold it. This was all way too much to handle at once.   Morgan shrugged. ""If we knew that, we probably wouldn't be here. The most likely scenario is that it's extraterrestrial, because there is nothing even remotely close anywhere else on Earth. This isn't an infection where you can just follow the pattern of symptoms back to Patient 0. This is an intelligent parasite that makes an effort to cover its tracks and secretly spread to others. Tracking down just one of these is insanely difficult, and finding three at once is a bonanza. Even when we do find one, we have to hunt down anyone who has had enough contact to possibly be infected over a years long span. And their behavior patterns aren't consistent either: sometimes, they'll just recklessly infect anyone they can: prostitutes, drifters, neighbors, family members... anyone that they can get alone and tie up long enough to get a pint of blood down their throats. Some of them, like your coworkers, tend to spread the infection through the host's social circle. This means that we have to...""  His explanation was interrupted by the distinct sound of shattering glass from outside, followed by rapid bursts of staccato gunfire. We looked back at the security feed just in time to see Amanda leaping out one of the windows. Morgan sprang to his feet and thundered out the back of the ambulance, gun in one hand and walkie-talkie in the other. I followed him out; Mike's body lay over a blanket of glass shards oozing some sort of yellowish green fluid from a dozen holes. Snot-colored is the best description I can think of. Three SWAT members stood over it, rifles at the ready in case it moved. Further down the parking lot, Sarah was slumped against a car, also spilling her guts onto the asphault.   ""I told you to watch those windows!"" Morgan screamed. ""Where is the other?""  ""It got away,"" a SWAT member said.  ""Well no shit!"" Morgan retorted. ""Did anyone go after it?""  There was an awkward silence.   ""We were focused on these two,"" one of the officers responded at last. Morgan looked like he was ready to strangle someone. He turned to me, and I involuntarily took a step backwards and held out my hands like I was surrendering.  ""Paul, we need your help,"" he said. ""We can't trust any of her other associates; not until we have a chance to run blood tests on them. You're the only one that we know is not infected. The parasite will try to hide somewhere that she knows; somewhere she feels safe. Can you help us track her down?""  ""I don't really have a choice, do I?""  Morgan shrugged. ""I guess not. Come on, let's ride.""    Part 3 here!"
Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,ThisIsTheRealNSA,320,Tue Mar 17 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Morgan's car roared down the highway, swerving wildly between lanes and even into oncoming traffic. I clutched the armrest for dear life, but he had a nonchalant sunday-driver smile as if he did this every day. Holy shit, he probably does do this every day.  ""Can we slow down a bit?"" I asked.  ""These things are fast, Paul. Now that she's abandoned the pretense of being human, you'll see what the infection can really do. Even at this speed and even with her wound, she'll probably beat us to her home. You need to think about anywhere that she spends a lot of time. The house is a good guess, depending on whether she has had time and opportunity to infect her family. For some reason, the parasite seems to target friends instead, so there's still a chance that they're clean.""  ""Why?"" I asked. ""Why would she go back to somewhere familiar instead of hiding in some random spot?""  Morgan shrugged. ""That's just not how they work. Maybe it's to warn the others? Maybe they just feel safety in numbers? To be honest, we don't have that much information about why they act the way they do. We just try to guess based on how they've acted previously, and they always flee back to their nests when threatened. So that's where we're going.""  We got off the highway and into Amanda's neighborhood. Morgan slowed the car and came to a stop down the block from her house. The lights were off. ""That doesn't mean anything,"" he said. ""They have excellent night vision."" He opened his door and stepped out.  ""Of course they do,"" I said, rolling my eyes.    We approached the front door. Morgan stopped short and stooped down on the lawn. He raised a hand, showing me his fingers, covered in a thin film of the same yellow-green snot that I'd seen leaking out of the other two in the parking lot. ""Definitely here,"" he whispered. ""And wounded."" He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a gun and handed it to me. ""You know how to shoot?""  ""I've played paintball a few times..."" I responded. Just the idea of having to shoot Amanda, even if she was infected with some parasite, made me want to throw up.   ""That'll be fine. The rounds in these guns aren't for killing; these are trackers. Kind of like paintballs. Except a bit more... forceful."" I breathed a loud sigh of relief, causing him to smirk a bit. ""They'll just mark her with an isotype signal that we can follow. That should lead us to any other nests that she can get to, and we can wipe them all out in one fell swoop."" I took the gun in my hand, holding it like I'd seen movie heroes do it. It still felt like I was doing it wrong.  ""What if she attacks me?"" I asked. ""And I actually do need to shoot her?""  He smirked, basically confirming that I would be fucked if that happened. ""I'll shoot her, then,"" he responded, pointing at a second gun holstered on his hip. That didn't make me feel much better.  ""All units,"" he whispered into his radio, ""Converging on suspect at 118 Mangrove Terrace; fluid residue indicates suspect is inside. All units respond immediately and standby for tracking procedure. I'm going to try and paint her.""  He turned back to me. ""Ok, let's go."" His eyes flashed like this was the best part of his job.   ""Aren't we waiting for backup?"" I said.   ""No, marking is most important; that's how we'll find the rest of the infected. We can't take a risk of letting her get away."" Without waiting for a reply, he took off across the lawn in a stooped run. I tried to follow in the same way, and just ended up doing a ridiculous half-skip, half-jog type thing. He put a finger to his lips as we reached the door; it wasn't even closed all the way. He nodded, as if confirming to himself that she was inside. I noticed more skin littering the atrium, which sent shivers of revulsion down my spine.   We followed the trail upstairs; thumps were coming from the bedroom. Morgan kicked open the door and turned on the lights, and I followed him through. The creature that used to be Amanda howled and turned toward the door, baring her suddenly-sharp teeth and claw-like fingernails. I froze up in shock as she eyed me hungrily. Probably would have been dead, but Agent Morgan shot her directly in the chest. There was a yellow splotch that did kind of look like she'd been hit with a paintball, except that part of her shirt was shredded and the scales were cracked by the impact. She howled again and dove out the window. Morgan moved to follow, but wasn't about to make a three-story jump.  ""Target painted,"" he said into the radio. ""Get the helicopters in the air, she'll be going to a secondary nest now. We need to find it and lock down that location now.""  I exhaled, realizing that I'd been holding my breath since she first glared at me. The gun had fallen out of my fingers, but Morgan wasn't disappointed. He slapped me on the back and smiled. ""You did good for your first time, kid. Most new agents run through dozens of simulations and still shit their pants during their first encounter. It gets easier. Let's get back to the car; the chase isn't done. And the others will take care of these.""  He gestured across the room, to a dark shape in the corner that I hadn't even noticed. Three comatose bodies: her mother, father, and brother, already well on their way to becoming whatever she had become.   I stifled a gag and followed Morgan back to the car.     Part 4 is here!"
Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,cakeslap,265,Tue Mar 17 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"I counted at least eight helicopters hovering low over the town, slowly crossing back and forth with spotlights. For the hundredth time today, I questioned my sanity. Morgan was at the wheel, barking orders into his phone while simultaneously listening to someone else on his radio. At least this time we were going a reasonable speed.  ""So where is this place again?"" he asked after hanging up the phone.  ""Down on 8th Street. The Waterfowl. It's this bar that she's been going to recently.""  ""Recently?"" Morgan repeated. ""As in, after she was sick for a week?""  I nodded in response, silently kicking myself for not seeing that connection earlier. ""I was actually planning to grab a drink with her there tonight,"" I added for no particular reason. I just felt like I had to tell someone how close I had come to becoming one of those things.  Morgan laughed. ""Looks like you dodged a bullet then."" He got back on the radio and impatiently asked for a status update; a helicopter confirmed the reading a short minute later. She was hiding out there.  By the time we arrived, soldiers had already cordoned off the area. Downtown was like a warzone; I'd never seen anything like it. Instead of sleepy stores and the usual meager crowd at the diner, there were snipers in the belltower a humvee roaming up and down Main. Morgan had issued an alert warning everyone in the town of a ""chemical leak"" and told everyone to stay home and lock their doors; all TV and Radio stations were broadcasting the message. I pointed out the absurdity of locking your doors to guard against a chemical leak, but he just laughed. ""Terrified people don't think, especially when they feel helpless"" he said. ""They just follow commands.""  The Waterfowl was dark and silent; it wasn't the most popular hangout in the city, but I'd never seen it looking this empty. I drew a rough sketch of the interior, based on the hazy memory of one night I'd been there. Two floors, and a little patio on the rooftop. Maybe a basement, but I'd never been down there. Morgan and a guy in army fatigues with a whole rainbow of ribbons down his chest took over from there, planning out the assault.   I waited by the car; my role here was done. Amanda had been found, and I just wanted to go back to my apartment and drink heavily for the next year or so. Given that my crush was a monster and half of my company had been shot to death in the parking lot (also monsters, by the way), there wasn't much to look forward to.  Morgan approached, holding a vest and a gun. Not the little tracker pistol that fit in the palm of my hand; this one looked like a rifle straight out of a sci-fi movie.   ""Unpierceable,"" he said, holding up the armor, ""and scale-penetrating,"" he said, lifting the rifle in the other hand. ""You're going to need them.""  ""You saw what happened last time,"" I said, still a bit embarrassed. ""I'm not going to be of any help in there.""  He shook his head. ""Again, not a choice. We may need you to identify some of them; we need to know who else in this town to check."" He tossed the equipment at me; I barely managed to catch it. ""We go in 2 minutes; get ready.""  Another helicopter whooshed overhead, bathing the street with its spotlight. This has to be a dream, I told myself.  Here is Part 5!"
Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,conim,275,Tue Mar 17 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"The soldiers swept the first floor before I was even inside. I barely managed to get a peek as they formed a column up the stairs, rifles trained on every darkened doorway. They moved in complete silence, but like they were of one mind. A voice from above gave the all clear signal; no one on the second floor or the patio.   ""Basement it is, then,"" said Morgan. He led the way to the kitchen; a frail door with peeling paint was the only entrance. Soldiers gathered around him and kicked their way in, thundering down the steps in a flash. I followed behind them like a lost puppy.  The first thing I saw were the bodies. More infected, still in the one-week coma; some still had dried blood crusted around their lips. They were slumped against the walls, forgotten, like someone had tried moving them and just given up. Morgan noticed it too. ""We'll worry about those later,"" he told the team.  Beams from the flashlights panned over the walls; the place seemed deserted. A soldier checked the little reader that tracked the isotype that Amanda had been marked with. ""She was definitely here, recently. Getting a strong reading.""  We spread out; the room was bigger than it seemed. The soldiers combed the walls while I stood in the middle waiting for something to do. Just my luck, though: I stumbled over something in the center of the room: A loose floorboard. I reached for my rifle and got to my feet.... but noticed that it wasn't just a floorboard; it was a trap door.  ""Agent Morgan!"" I hissed, pointing at it. He whistled, and the soldiers converged on the spot like a pack of dogs. Morgan raised three fingers and counted down, then wrenched the door open in one quick motion.  Three of them sprang out immediately, claws bared. They slashed into the closest soldier, growling like beasts. They found holes in the armor and dug in before being riddled with bullets. But more and more poured out. I aimed my gun at the hole entrance and fired wildly, figuring I had to hit something. Everything was a blur of swinging flashlights and glistening copper scales and animalistic howls and screams of pain. Bodies, human and Vampire, littered the floor.  The last one out was Amanda. Even in the darkness, I recognized her face. Or, what she hadn't shed yet. She leapt nimbly into the basement and made a beeline for Agent Morgan, who was already fighting off two of them. He didn't even see her coming. I steadied the rifle as best I could with my quaking knees and quivering hands and... well, I was pretty much a bowl of jelly at this point. My flashlight beam swung back and forth like a pendulum.  She was about ten feet from digging into Morgan's back when I had a moment of clarity. Time seemed to stop and I took a deep breath and everything just fell into place; her coppery scales passed right into the beam of the gun's laser sight, and I squeezed the trigger. She fell to the floor with a demonic wail, and Morgan turned swiftly to finish her off with one shot to the head. Then he glanced at me, looking both surprised and impressed that I'd managed to hit something. And just like that, it was over.   I picked through the bodies, trying to point out any that I knew; there wasn't much that I could tell them. Morgan was looking down the hole under the trap door.  ""We've never seen them dig before,"" he remarked. ""They do usually try to hide, but I've never seen them try to go underground. They're learning."" That sentence alone gave me chills.  We stomped up the stairs as a hazmat crew arrived to dispose of everything. They took my shoes, armor, even my clothes; leaving me with generic grey sweatpants, a white shirt, and some sneakers. ""They have to dispose of anything that may have been in contact with the infection,"" Morgan explained as we walked back to the car.   ""Well, what now?"" he said as I climbed back into the passenger seat. I started to give him the address for my apartment, but he cut me off with one gesture of his hand. ""Not what I meant. You don't want to go back to your home."" He said it with 100% certainty. ""Not knowing that there are still plenty of Vampires out there. So the only question is whether you want to join us now, or if I'm going to have to come back and get you in a few weeks.""  I gaped like fish on dry land.   ""Now it is,"" he said with a smile as he revved the engine.    That's the end! I hope you all enjoyed the story!

I'm pretty sure you meant come after him to kill him because by then the vampires will have found and turned him, but I felt that sentence maybe could have been a bit more obvious in that regard. It didn't get the point across as much as I feel it could have. I'm not a writer in any sense, but usually those last one liners in stories like these really hit hard. Maybe something like ""you can either join us now, or I can put a bullet in you in a few weeks"", again this pretty cliche, you can probably think of something much better. But amazing story."

Probably also capture the character developments of a 'turning to zombie' person for science of course :) Great read ! Thanks !  EDIT: A few words and grammar.

Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,ghenne04,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"I know you said it's cliche, but I have to say it made it more realistic. I was even thinking how you couldn't just go back to a normal life after that, whenever I have experiences that get my blood pumping for any reason I always want to continue the activity.   This is some amazing writing!"

I expected there to be a cliffhanger at the ending, but in my opinion this ending actually provides pretty decent closure.  By the way   A loose floorboard.

Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,Tyr_Orion,2,Wed Mar 18 06:14:40 2015 UTC,"They were able to test it for infection, so they were 100% certain that he was cleared. And since he was walking around (rather than comatose) they knew he hadn't been infected since donating blood.  They'd tracked the Vampires to his office already, this way they didn't have to shoot h first to be sure he wasn't a RaptorInDisguise."

Just one minor (negligible even) detail:  Do you mean ""isotope"" when you say ""isotype""? Isotope is the radioactive kind which would make sense considering the tracking, whereas isotype usually pertains to genes or proteins related to some specific gene family.  Keep up the good work :)"

Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,FadeKing,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:41:04 2015 UTC,then hopefully find someone willing to publish it.     Have you considered self publish?    I would recommend giving out a free copy of the full book to a few people to read to catch any problems such as spelling and so on.    Then can publish as a digital book via Amazon or so on.
Luna_Lovewell,2zcqco,Scorlibra,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:29:03 2015 UTC,About the book - what program do you write it in? Like is it just a huge Word file? Also how long is it?  Great story by the way!

Luna_Lovewell,2z8m8s,HB_Lester,5,Mon Mar 16 15:58:55 2015 UTC,"I read your first two parts to this , then totally forgot and stopped keeping up. I was reminded of this story today and came to your subreddit to try to get caught up, and saw that you posted the first chapter of the novel. (Very excited to buy it when it's finished!) I just read the first chapter. What part comes next? Where does this ""Discovery of the New World"" part fit in? I don't want to read anything out of order..."
Luna_Lovewell,2z8m8s,Hadfield_in_space,4,Tue Mar 17 04:19:05 2015 UTC,This story about the discovery of the New World and this story about the war against China take place hundreds of years before the events of the book. They are just kind of little insights into the world.
Luna_Lovewell,2z8m8s,Curane,6,Tue Mar 17 12:50:36 2015 UTC,I'm curious about what the outcome of roman contact will be. It should still be a slaughter with superior metal and deseases. But of roman is still polytheistic then they'd probably let the Aztecs and Incas all keep their religion. Which may lead to a much more bloody Latin America with human sacrifices and stuff.
Luna_Lovewell,2z8m8s,arcadefire111,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"While Rome is polytheistic, and have historically been fairly lenient towards religion, they always tried to crush anything that was a threat. I think that any culture that has human sacrifice as a staple of the worship would definitely pose a threat to the empire. They would probably let them live and might even be fairly lenient with the Mayan society, but definitely no human sacrifice. It just wouldn't suit a Roman, imo."

Luna_Lovewell,2ywxjo,aether_dancer,8,Fri Mar 13 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"I love seeing good personifications of Satan   I have trouble seeing him as anything other than a defeated champion of humanity.  After all, Lucifer basically wanted to not be Yaweh's servant any more, and wanted freedom for humans as well.  It's really tough to have some familiarity with the Bible (but not a religious upbringing) and not think Lucifer comes off as the good guy in the conflict.  Especially when you consider who the author of the tale is supposed to be.  Lucifer never put anyone in a garden in a state of ignorance of right and wrong and then punished them for doing wrong.  Lucifer never killed most of the human race in a flood then said, ""Sorry... I won't do that again"".  Lucifer didn't set down a bunch of laws and fail to use his omnipotence to have them remain unedited and unaltered by error or deliberate act of generations of humanity.  Lucifer is the guy who stood up and said, ""Existence is intolerable as a slave, I want to be free""... and then got beaten for insolence."

Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Luna_LoveWell,16,Wed Mar 11 13:25:15 2015 UTC,This I actually got gilded for. Surprised me.    My personal favorite was this.
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,10,Wed Mar 11 14:56:55 2015 UTC,Wow. I love that prompt in the first link. And your story was amazing. I would definitely love to see how everything is set up after 20 soldiers had gone through or something. Very nice work! The second one I thought was a bit drawn out but had a very good pay-off.
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,4,Wed Mar 11 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"My wife keeps begging me to finish the second one. (She isn't into Sci-fi, so the first one was sort of... ""Huh. Ok."") So now I have a wifely mandate to ""finish"" the starbucks story. Sigh. I never did come up with a good idea for how to end the Space Marines story. Sorry."
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,3,Wed Mar 11 15:25:17 2015 UTC,I have that problem a lot. I love thinking of universes but I don't know how to end the stories.
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,SovreignTripod,3,Wed Mar 11 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"My big problem is ""talking head syndrome."" That or coming up with ""filler"" content that makes the world ""real"". I have lots of story ideas, but actually getting words out that make sense is really hard for me. Example; I have a non-WP story about angels, demons, a church under siege (I am a christian, most of my non-WP stuff is based around my faith), but actually writing out a scene is like pulling teeth. Words just don't seem to match what's in my head."
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,2,Wed Mar 11 15:33:57 2015 UTC,So I take it you never added more to the space marine story?  It's really good!
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Curane,2,Wed Mar 11 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"No. I just couldn't stand to see them all die and then... nothing. I get pretty invested in my characters. Even Dean the coward. If I were to finish it I would need to have an ending that would leave me satisfied with story, not depressed."

Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,3,Tue Mar 17 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"I remeber why you are tagged marine story guy. You need to write a book, man."
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,TheSpekio,3,Wed Mar 11 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hah! That's an awesome tag. Thank you! As to a book... I have a few I am spinning out. But I think my native length is ""short stories."" Plus pretty much anything I would want to publish would be (heavily) influenced by my personal faith. (Think C.S. Lewis or Frank Peretti.) Pretty specific target audience. Thanks for the kuduos, though. I really do appreciate it."
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,3,Wed Mar 11 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"The starbucks story reads as a short story. The marine story, however, feels unfinished, mainly because of that last line.  As for being influenced by your faith, as long as it's not preachy, I don't really mind. It's fun to see the world from the eyes of someone with a different point of view. Not guaranteed I'd like it, but I'd give it a try.  You have a subreddit?"

As to being preachy, well... the target audience are Charismatic Christians. I.E. miraculous healings, visions, spiritual warfare... yeah. I'm aware it's not everyone's cup of tea, so I tend to not toss it around much. The Marine store ... I played it out in my head trying to stay as realistic as I could and... It's kinda depressing. These guys are all gonna die. Alone. No hope of rescue. That is just... very sad. I didn't want to go there, so I stopped."
Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Judasthehammer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"I think there's a rescue opportunity. From Earth they would see 12 marines go into the portal and then.. Nothing. They'd figure out what had happened and set up a  radiotransmitter-station on another planet 2-300 light years away, explaining the silence for the first two. So the next line could be ""Maddox heard the radio clicking"". 2-300 LY away could mean a travelling time of 500 years maybe? Or maybe humans could invent wormhole-tech themselves within a couple of hundred years, if we assume it was from aliens in the first place.  Not to tell you what to do, but it would just be such a shame to let the story die :'("

Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Aleiocus,3,Wed Mar 11 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think the best advice I can give you is to really work on showing, not telling. It's something that I struggle with a lot, especially when trying to write quickly.  For example, take this section from your first story:   he more I hang out with my fellow crew, the more I realise how stupid I am. The crew, populated by mainly scientists, engineers and doctors, are considered to be some of the brightest people in the world. However, there are only two of us, they consider us the muscle of the group.   You just put it out there that he's stupid compared to everyone else. Instead, try showing us that he's stupider than the rest of them. Show him doing a relatively simple task and needing to get help from one of the smarter crew members. Show that smarter crew member rolling their eyes and saying ""I've told you how to do this a thousand times."" That kind of thing. Actions that show he is stupid through the narrative, instead of flatly stating it."

Luna_Lovewell,2yoba7,Satans_Left_Leg,2,Thu Mar 12 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"Probably this one from a few days ago.   [WP] You go out on a mission to kill a giant, a quest from which no man have returned. When you get there you find out the giant is overall a cool dude and the men that never returned just stayed with him because he was so fun  There's a few others I've done that I really like too, but almost no one saw them. Like this one from the other day - two points of view on one bank robbery."

Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,Luna_LoveWell,271,Tue Mar 10 16:36:12 2015 UTC,"I tried to tell President Howard what had happened on the flight home. He didn't listen. The third time I brought it up, he snapped at me.  ""Polly, I have a lot of things going on, given that I am running a country. Your ability has served me faithfully for the past 3 years and I have no reason to think it will stop now, regardless of what off-handed remark President Demitrov said. He was probably just boasting; everyone likes to think that they have a good poker face. All of our intelligence sources confirm what he told me at the summit, in addition to your work. So please excuse me if the President of the United States does not take foreign policy advice from a teenager. Now go back to your seat; I have no need of your services right now.""  I opened my mouth to respond, but decided against it. I stomped to the back of the plane and everyone else in the passenger compartment scattered, trying to get out of range. Not uncommon; even if someone wasn't currently lying, they still didn't like the idea of being controlled by my ability. I had gotten used to sitting alone. I slumped down in my chair, turned up my iPod, and brainstormed how to convince the President.  Air Force One landed in Washington around noon the next day and everyone loaded into the caravan of black SUVs. Everyone except for me, of course. The President liked having me nearby when he needed me, but far away at any other time. You should have seen his face when I suggested that I accompany him on the campaign trail!  No, I got my own separate car. And this time, I was happy to be isolated. ""Not the White House,"" I told the driver as soon as we turned onto Pennsylvania. ""We're going to the FBI."" The driver was confused, but didn't disobey.  I walked in and flashed my White House clearance badge; it got me in to pretty much anywhere. I had a higher clearance than most generals. I made my way through the building that I knew so well, having been retained here for almost 9 months to help interrogate suspects. I was only 13 then, and yet hardened gangsters and thugs would quake in their boots as soon as they saw me coming down the hall. The memory of it made me smile just a bit.  Agent Hughes was in his office, as usual. The man practically lived there. His life's work was finding, identifying, and isolating the ""Specials."" People with abilities, that is; he just called them that to make it sound like a compliment. In reality, most of the powers were harmful or dangerous in some ways; at best, utterly useless.  ""Polly!"" he shouted as I came through the door. ""Always happy to see one of my oldest friends!"" Not really the right word; ""prisoner"" probably would be more accurate. But at least he meant it.  ""This isn't a social call,"" I said. I'd learned long ago to spare the pleasantries like ""how are you,"" because people actually did tell me how they were, and the answer was often embarrassing and shameful.  ""Oh?"" he responded, nervous. No way to lie his way out of whatever I wanted.  ""I need Cassandra's address."""
Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,iForqot,271,Tue Mar 10 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"I knocked on the door for a fourth time. Still no answer. I checked the scrap of paper with the address written on it, and compared it against the curb. These suburban tract homes all looked the same, but this was definitely the address that Agent Hughes had given me. Across the street, the neighbor mowing his lawn cut the engine and looked at me suspiciously. In a small town like this one, a newcomer with DC plates was bound to raise some eyebrows.  Fifth time's a charm. I rang the bell again and peered through the mottled glass window. This time, a set of eyes stared back; I jumped back involuntarily as the door opened just a crack.  ""What do you want?"" she said. I could only see a sliver of her face: green eyes and pale skin.   ""Agent Hughes sent me,"" I responded. Her eyes flashed in recognition, and she shut the door once again. I was worried that she wouldn't open it again. But I head metal rattle against metal, and she pulled it open all the way. ""Come in,"" she ordered as she faked a smile and waved to Mr. Lawnmower still watching us.  ""I told him not to contact me anymore!"" she yelled as soon as she had bolted the lock.   ""I know,"" I said, trying to calm her a bit. ""I read the file. I know how many times he has been here to interview you. You have the right genetic marker and claim that you see the future, but he can't find any evidence of your abilities. Codename Cassandra, right?""  Her cheeks turned red. ""BECAUSE NO ONE BELIEVES ME,"" she said. ""I told those assholes everything that would happen to them in the coming months, and they still didn't believe me. Even after it happened! And I'm sick of trying to convince them I have this ability that I don't even want.""  ""I believe you, though,"" I told her. ""I have a power too. And I need your help.""    I heard the tap run in the kitchen, and she returned a moment later with a glass of water and some triscuits. ""Sorry, it's all the snack food I have in the pantry.""   ""No problem"" I said. I took a bite and forced a smile; they were stale.  ""So everything that anyone says to you is true?""   I shrugged. ""Unless they're shouting across the room or over the phone, yeah. It's like a bubble around me. No one can lie in response to a direct question when I'm nearby.""  ""Ask me something,"" she said. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Everyone did this when they first learn about my abilities.   ""How many fingers do you have?""  She held up her hands like she needed to double check. Her mouth opened and closed like a gaping goldfish. I could see her tongue wiggling around, trying to form the words that she just couldn't spit out. Her eyes scrunched up with effort and she bared her teeth.  ""TEN!"" she shouted at last. There was a pause, then ""DAMMIT!"" I laughed and patted her on the leg.  ""See? It works for everyone. Well, almost. And that's why I need your help."" I explained the situation with the President, and how Demitrov had managed to lie at the summit. And how Russia was not going to disarm like they claimed.   ""And that brings us to your role,"" I said finally. ""How far into the future can you see? And how specifically?""  ""It depends..."" she hedged. ""Usually, if you ask me a question about whether something will happen, I can get some idea of how things will go. It usually depends on who asks, and how much control over future events they will have. If you ask what you'll have for dinner tomorrow, I'll be easily able to see that, because you are the one who makes that decision. If you ask me about some far-off event that you have no influence over, then my vision will be... hazier.""  I pondered this answer. ""So if the President asks you about disarmament, you'd get a pretty clear picture, right?""  She nodded. ""Should, yeah.""  I stood up, leaving the stale triscuits on the coffee table. ""Get your coat, then. We need to get to Washington.""    Part 4 on its way, but in the meantime, you should subscribe to my subreddit if you're enjoying the story!"
Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,iForqot,314,Tue Mar 10 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"The Secret Service was being fussy about giving Cassandra a pass, even after I directly asked her if she had any intention of hurting the President. The agents at the desk, Brown and Meyerson, both knew my power but as soon as they heard that she had one too, they went into full lockdown mode. They didn't really care that her power was utterly harmless.  So now we had to be escorted by six members of the Secret Service, who were probably glaring at us behind their sunglasses.   ""Hey Brown,"" I called out as we left the security desk. ""What exactly do you think of Meyerson's wife?"" His eyes grew wide as he fought the urge to answer, even though he had no say in the matter. The argument was just starting as we headed toward the West Wing.     ""You need to listen to her, Sir. I'm not leaving this office until you do.""  He stood from behind his desk, towering over me and looking as imposing as possible. ""You don't give orders to me, Polly."" His tone was calm, but there was a veiled threat behind it. The Secret Servant agents were getting antsy.  ""Either you listen, or I quit,"" I whispered to him. I was too valuable for that. ""And maybe I go talk to the press corps first. Or possibly your wife."" I'm not sure which threat scared him more. ""Or stop by and see you at a campaign event sometime."" This one really clinched it.  ""Fine,"" he said. ""Send her in.""  The Secret Service agents opened the door. Cassandra looked utterly terrified. I explained her abilities and what she did. The President was not as skeptical as most people would be; he had seen what I (and others like me) could do.  ""Before you hear what Cassandra has to say, remember my ability,"" I reminded him. ""Remember who I am and what I can do. That nobody can lie around me, right?"" He nodded, still irked by the interruption but worried about what I might do.   ""All right,"" I said. ""Mr. President, please ask Cassandra whether Russia will disarm their weapons within a year like President Demitrov promised.""  He repeated the question like a reticent first grader learning vocabulary words.   ""No,"" Cassandra responded almost instantly. ""In fact, it looks like he has only increased Russia's supply of weapons and ordered the construction of new delivery vehicles. Primarily bombers and missiles.""  ""Bullshit,"" he said immediately. Cassanda pursed her lips and balled her hands into fists.   ""Mr. President, remember. I'm right here. There's no way she can lie to you.""  ""Right..."" he answered. I could see the confusion in his eyes. In his mind he knew that it was true; she was within my bubble. But in his gut, he still felt that she was wrong.   ""What about the missile defense systems? Has he deactivated those?""  ""Two more built in Kazakhstan, actually. And another on Sakhalin Island.  ""Bu..."" The President managed to stop himself. His knuckles went white clutching the arms of the desk.  After a minute of what was clearly a fierce internal battle, his mind won. ""All right,"" he said. ""You're right. They're going to back out of the deal."" He picked up the red phone on his desk and drummed his fingers on the desk for a moment.   ""Demitrov, you son of a bitch!"" he shouted. They argued back and forth for a few minutes until the President put a hand over the receiver. ""Girls, this could take a while. You may want to go back to your office."" I nodded and led Cassandra out the door.  ""OH!"" he called out as we crossed the threshold, hand still covering the receiver. ""One last thing! Do I win re-election?""  Cassandra smirked. ""Well, you should focus on policies for the middle class and women. But yes."" The president thumped his desk enthusiastically and went back to yelling at the Russian president.  She noticed me staring and grinned. ""He's going to win regardless; his opponent is an idiot. At least this way he'll do something good to deserve it.""    That's the end of this one (for now)!

Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,elcub,4,Wed Mar 11 12:52:33 2015 UTC,"Amazing story, Luna, as always. The only discontinuity I see is that when The President asks Cassandra about the reelection at the end, because she's still inside Polly's bubble she would be forced to answer the question directly, not just with the little quip she gives.  Other than that, absolutely fantastic writing. I look forward to your next story!"

Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,LyraOfOxford,2,Tue Mar 10 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"""One last thing! Do I win re-election?"" Cassandra smirked. ""Well, you should focus on policies for the middle class and women. But yes."" The president thumped his desk enthusiastically and went back to yelling at the Russian president. She noticed me staring and grinned. ""He's going to win regardless; his opponent is an idiot. At least this way he'll do something good to deserve it.""   Given you described Polly's power as:   Anyone within one hundred yards of me is unable to ever lie. And not just outright falsehoods. No lies by omission. No misrepresentations. No nothing. I somehow make everything come out completely true.   wouldn't Cassandra be unable to misrepresent the win condition?"
Luna_Lovewell,2ykms1,someonethatiusedtobe,4,Wed Mar 11 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"She didn't misrepresent. I wrote it carefully. She says ""You should focus on policies."" She never says ""If you focus on these policies..."""

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Luna_LoveWell,88,Sat Mar 7 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"Four hours later, the green landing lights of the runway blinked through the fog ahead of Caius as he dipped to land. The wheels of the landing gear touched down on the brand new asphalt with a squeak and bounce. Julius and Tiberius touched down neatly behind him, and they taxied over to the Naval Intelligence hangar. The automated mechanics swiveled out of their little compartments lining the walls like a hive of silvery ants, instruments extending from their little metal bodies with a whir. The bots began to swarm over the plane as they came to a halt, servicing the plane and removing the flight recorders to be sent into Central Processing. But they weren’t the only ones waiting inside the large domed building for the pilots to return.   As Caius snapped open the canopy of his plane, lights clicked on suddenly and the squad’s staff sergeant strode out of the briefing room door. “Airman Caius Serica,” he bellowed, echoing through the huge hanger. Behind him, a group of heavily armed guards filled the doorway, wearing bright crimson uniforms buttoned up to their necks and with bone-white masks covering up their faces. Praetorians, Caius realized. Lingering in the doorway, Caius recognized Generals Kaneshiro and Lucullus standing silently, watching him clamber out of the narrow cockpit. Caius had never even seen Kaneshiro in person; he was the ranking commander of the entire Japanese campaign. And Lucullus was the general in charge of the Fukuoka base.   They must have already heard about the Ming battleship, Caius thought. How had they gotten the information this fast? And why the guards? His mouth went dry as he desperately tried to remember if anything had gone wrong. The generals were staring intently at Caius, studying him like he was some misshapen science experiment. Lucullus turned and whispered something unintelligible; Kaneshiro nodded, stroking his graying mustache.   Julius taxied into a hangar bay next to him and opened his own cockpit canopy with a snap. “What’s going on?” he whispered to Caius, who only shrugged in response.    “Caius, come with us,” the sergeant said. Caius tried to read his expression, with no luck.  Min Jae and Julius leapt from their seats and stepped in front of Caius’s plane like protective mother hens. “Why?” they asked, eying the Praetorians. Everyone knows that when you leave with them, you don’t usually get to come back. “What has he done?”  General Kaneshiro stepped forward into the center of the wide, echoing room, and addressed Julius and Tiberius first. “Do not worry about Caius here; he will be just fine. We simply need to have a conversation with him.” He had a quiet but commanding voice that could quiet a crowded room. Julius and Min-Jae relaxed, but still didn’t move from in front of Caius.  Caius jumped out of his seat and onto the concrete floor in between his companions.  Julius towered over him, but that was fairly normal for people from the Western portion of the Empire. Asian citizens like Caius were usually much shorter. “We’ve taken the liberty of packing some of your clothes. Please put on your formal gear, son,” Lucullus spoke for the first time. A servant rushed forward, opening the large black case in his hands to reveal Caius’s gold-plated armor and ceremonial sword. Cauis saw the puzzled expressions on the faces of his companions. He wouldn’t need formal gear for a debriefing, they were all thinking.  “I have some personal belongings that I need,” Caius responded, not moving. “Specifically, the pictures of my family. They are on the bookshelf in my bunk.”  “You can send for those later,” General Lucullus answered with a casual wave of his perfectly manicured hand.   “Sir…” Caius wasn’t one to disobey an order, but this point was non-negotiable.   General Kaneshiro understood, though. Even after two hundred years of unity, the East and West were still very different places. And Lucullus was from the West.   “Get the pictures,” he ordered a servant waiting nearby, who promptly rushed off to the barracks.  Caius gave a crisp, thankful salute and strapped on the formal uniform. He removed his helmet, revealing a shock of fairly short black hair that stuck out at weird angles, the result of wearing the tight aviator helmet all day. He removed his flightsuit, revealing wiry but defined muscles. He took the robes from the servant and slipped them over his head, then began the arduous process of strapping on his formal armor. The clanging metal echoed through the hangar, mixing with the sounds of the drones taking out parts of his plane. The masked faces of the Praetorian guards, twisted into permanent grimaces, glared at him intently with their gloved hands resting on the carved ivory hilts of their rifles. “Ready, sirs,” Caius said as formally as possible, barely managing to keep his hand in place. His mind raced to and fro, unable to focus. Why had they packed his things? Did this have something to do with the ship?   The generals turned wordlessly and walked through the gaping hangar door out onto the runway and into the evening mist, followed by their deadly entourage. Caius turned briefly and looked at his companions with a slight, helpless shrug. Taking a deep breath, he followed his superiors out, giving his plane a light pat on the wing for luck. Caius could sense the eyes of the rest of the flight crew in the barracks peering out behind him, probably pushing and shoving at each other for a better view. Maybe taking bets on whether he’d return with lashes or medals. As they passed the door to the barracks, General Lucullus turned to the staff sergeant and dismissed him with a wave of his hand. He gave Caius one last long look, a mix of dread and burning curiosity. Caius nodded to him almost invisibly as the sergeant slipped inside."
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,TheYoungPadawan,66,Sat Mar 7 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"Caius marched in lockstep behind the generals through the base; nobody said a word. The group arrived finally at Lucullus’ office, a squat, square building perched on a hill overlooking the entire camp. For a man so obsessed with appearances, this building must be a constant insult to the General. Caius stopped on the threshold with a salute, waiting until the generals noticed him; an enlisted man must never enter the lodgings of a superior without express permission.   Kaneshiro turned to Lucullus with a smirk. “You lost him,” he said gently with his almost indistinguishable Hakata accent, pointing back at the entrance. Caius maintained his salute. Lucullus turned back as if having forgotten that the young soldier was even with them. “Oh, of course. Enter, young man. Please,” the general said with a firm tone.   Lucullus plopped down on a plush red couch, put his boots up on the table in the center, and gestured silently to a chair across from him. Caius clanked awkwardly in his formal armor as he took a seat, sword banging against the polished wooden chair frame. General Kaneshiro remained standing silently in a corner, contemplating Caius through small circular glasses perched on the rim of his nose. Medals and awards of a hundred different color combinations decorated his shoulder patches and draped down his arms like an old tree covered in moss. They tinkled quietly every time the general moved. Instead of traditional golden formal armor with the emperor’s eagle emblazoned on the front, he wore plain steel armor stamped “SPQR,” the initialism of the civilian government.   “Can I get you anything, lad? I can have the servants whip up some dinner for you if you’re hungry,” Lucullus said, assessing Caius somewhat suspiciously with watery brown eyes peering over his prominent Roman nose. “Or perhaps some coffee? We’ve got the finest beans from Ethiopia; none of that powdered nonsense.” His voice carried a hint of pride, as though it spoke to his clout that he was able to get coffee beans.   Caius was tempted; it had been a long time since he’d had real coffee. But he declined politely. “No, sir. I’m fine, thank you.” No need to appear greedy in front of my superiors, he reasoned. A good soldier does without.  Kaneshiro gave him an almost unnoticeable nod of approval, but said “The boy isn’t going to ask you for anything, Lucullus. He’s not stupid.” Kaneshiro turned to a servant waiting just outside the doorway. “Three cups and a hot pot of coffee.” Caius silently thanked the old man, who was indeed famous for (among other things) knowing what his troops needed with almost clairvoyant accuracy. The servant dashed off to the kitchens. “And bring the boy some dinner,” Kaneshiro shouted after him.  “I suppose you’re wondering why you have been summoned,” Lucullus said, leaning back on the plump, luxurious cushions of the couch and examining a slightly worn sleeve cuff with extreme distaste. He stayed silent for a moment, letting the suspension build. “Well… so are we.” He stopped, studying Caius intently for any reaction, as though he suspected that Caius might know the reason.  Caius waited. Surely there was more. Lucullus sniffed, disappointed that Caius didn’t reveal the secret.  “We received a call this afternoon,” Lucullus continued, gesturing to the video monitor on his desk “From the Emperor himself, summoning you back to Europe. Only you,” the general added with emphasis. “Any reason you can think of why the leader of the civilized world might be interested in talk to you?” Lucullus could barely contain his disdain as he said ‘you,’ emphasizing that Caius was just a pitiful worm, one grunt in an army of millions.  The servant bustled in suddenly with a laden silver tray of cups, cream, and sugar. Caius exhaled, thankful for the momentary interruption. A second servant brought a bubbling pot of coffee spewing aromatic steam that filled the room. He poured it into the delicate silver mugs and scampered back out of sight. Lucullus loaded cream and spooned sugar into his mug, stirring it endlessly; Kaneshiro smacked his lips as he drank his coffee black. Caius only took a dash of cream and sipped quietly.  After savoring the flavor for a moment, Lucullus turned back to Caius, still awaiting an answer.  “I’m not sure, Sir.” Caius responded. The generals stared, waiting for a better explanation. “Perhaps something to do with this last mission? I don’t know how someone in Rome would have found out about it already, but sighting that Ming warship all the way up here by Japan is pretty important.”  “Ming ship?” Kaneshiro asked, narrowing his eyes. “Are you sure it wasn’t Japanese?” Caius recounted the story for him as quickly as possible, including dive-bombing the ship to get a view of the uniforms. “Interesting. This is definitely important…” he stroked his mustache. “Perhaps they are forming an alliance. We would need some confirmation from our intelligence inside the Foreign Ministry…”   Lucullus rolled his eyes as Kaneshiro started muttering plans to himself.  “Regardless of how important your find, that’s not why you were summoned. The message was transmitted just after you took off; before the ship was even sighted. And besides; these are matters that he leaves to the War Council. He rarely takes interest in the day-to-day affairs of the war. What more could the Emperor need to know, and why bring you directly to Rome?” His tone was pretty clear: Lucullus did not appreciate being left out of the loop on these things. His role as middleman of that type of information was all he really had.  ""There's nothing about the mission that you didn't tell us?"" Lucullus asked, trying to hide the suspicious undertones of the question. “No other encounters with the enemy? Or maybe some previous mission where you saw something?”  He had no response, and the generals were silent. Caius looked down at the silver mug, emblazoned in red with the imperial eagle crest. “Do you know anyone in Rome, Caius? Is there anyone you correspond with? Anyone that you have talked to about the camp here?” Lucullus’ suspicious tone grew hard, almost threatened.   “No, sir. Nobody.” Caius responded firmly. No one that I could report your incompetence to, he wanted to blurt out.  Lucullus eyed him, trying to gauge his honesty.  “Well, that’s that, then.” Lucullus said at last, and once more leaned back and sipped from his coffee. “Let’s get the boy to the train station.”"
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,SomeCartoon,73,Sat Mar 7 17:40:00 2015 UTC,"The barricaded gates rolled open with a screech of metal, and the jeeps pulled out onto the highway toward downtown Fukuoka. The sun, still barely visible through the fog, burned like a white disk against a backdrop of grey. They drove over new roads and bridges through sparse forests and past acres of rice paddies.  “You must be something special, son.” Kaneshiro said finally. “The empire has dispatched a train specifically to bring you down to Europe. Even I don’t get that kind of treatment.” The old general grinned, even though it wasn’t a joke. For the first time in the evening, Caius smiled back. Kaneshiro had a way of making people comfortable despite his rank.  “You know,” he continued, “If there is anything you did not want to say in front of Lucullus, you can say it now. Any reason you might be sought after by the Emperor himself?”  Caius shook his head. “Not that I can think of, Sir.”  The general was satisfied by this answer. “Are you at all familiar with politics, my boy?”   Caius shook his head. “Only what I have studied in history and read in a few books,” he answered.   “Rome can be … an odd place,” Kaneshiro continued, struggling to put his emotions into words, waving his hands as though he could snatch the right words out of the air. “For those of us raised here in the East, it can be quite a shock.” He seemed to be struggling to find the right words. “Do you know anything about my career, Caius?” He knew the answer already, but was asking to be polite. Caius nodded in response, unsure of what to say; he could sense the pain in the general’s voice. Everyone knew that he had risen quickly through the ranks of the military after his legendary campaign last time the Ming Emperor in Exile had tried to retake Southern China; Kaneshiro had even counterattacked and claimed Hanoi in the name of the Empire.   “I was involved in the most recent war with the Ming, and the Empire’s forces were very successful.” He didn’t want to take credit for it himself, but Caius knew the truth. “After our victory, I too was summoned to Rome in a similar manner. The Emperor himself honored me with the Steel Crown and assigned me as deputy to his War Minister. He even graced me with a title of Nobility.” The old general smiled briefly at the memory. “But after only a few months, the Emperor announced that he had chosen one of his sons as heir, a young man that I had never even seen around the Palace. The new heir took an instant disliking to the War Minister, and by extension, me. As soon as he became Emperor, I was dismissed from my position and ‘reassigned’ here in disgrace.” Even decades later, the pain was still visible.   “I don’t know why the emperor has summoned you, but regardless of his reason, you will be thrust into the politics of the Empire, and there is no more dangerous position. Be warned that you are now a piece in their chess match, even if you don’t want to play. Anyone that you think you can trust: forget it. No matter who it is, they want to use you to elevate their own position. They’ll forget about you as soon as they stop needing you. Just be warned, son,” Kaneshiro said finally. “These Westerners are wildly unpredictable, and have no honor.” The conversation turned to happier topics, and the general did not bring up the subject again.  The jeep crested a hill, revealing the sprawling metropolis of Fukuoka under them. It had been an important port even back when it was part of the Shogunate. With the Roman annexation, it had become larger than even Tokyo or Kyoto. They passed through the massive, ornately carved marble triumphal arch, at least fifteen stories high, commemorating the victory almost sixty five years ago. The foundation was built over the crumbling remains of the city walls, a reminder to the citizens that none could withstand Rome’s power.  They soon arrived at the train station, jam packed with commuters streaming out of the city. Through the hubbub, the guards cleared a bubble for Kaneshiro and Caius; no one wanted to get close to a group of Praetorians. They made their way to the far end of the track where a sleek silver train waited, guarded by a perimeter of soldiers. It looked incredibly out of place: a gleaming steel beast surrounded by the old, pre-war era station made of carved wooden beams, paper walls, and peeling paint.   Kaneshiro stopped by the door and shook his hand. “You’re a good soldier, Caius. You’re going to be just fine there.” He grabbed Caius’ hand and shook heartily, pulling Caius in close. “Just remember what I said,” he whispered. “Don’t trust them.” Then he turned and walked away, disappearing into the crowd.   The guards ushered Caius onto the train and through the cabin. The ultra-sleek, gleaming steel and chrome outer appearance of the train contrasted with the luxurious, classical look on the inside. The train cars were beautifully decorated with plush furniture, rich wood paneling, and soothing lamps. Sitting behind an intricately carved wooden desk with legs sculpted to look like roaring lions, the train’s single occupant sat in a stout velvet chair. He wore spindly gold-rimmed reading glasses that framed a slightly chubby but friendly face. His formal robes, impeccably clean and white, stuck out slightly over his paunchy belly. His hair was a bushy mane of grey; only his thick beard retained some flecks of black.  “Good morning, Caius,” the man said with a friendly smile. He stood from his seat and clicked off the small tablet computer that he’d been studying. Caius snapped his heels together and saluted, not sure exactly who he was speaking with.   “No need for that, son. I’m not in the military.” He extended a hand warmly. “I’m Marcus Geganius. Your Advocate.”"

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Meffrey_Dewlocks,6,Tue Apr 21 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"Another person asked this as well, so I might change that.  I meant 'jeep' just as like a standard military vehicle. The name comes from ""GP,"" which stands for ""General purpose."" I didn't really have another good word to describe it."
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Laxking20,2,Tue Apr 21 14:00:09 2015 UTC,Maybe you could make up a name for it? Maybe relate it back to chariots (this is Rome after all)
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,The_Flying_KV-4,12,Tue Apr 21 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"Every time there is a characterization of Rome in the modern world, it always seems so unnatural to me. Like the writers designed it to be as close to Ancient Rome as possible, even though it has been thousands of years! I tried to take a critical look and think about what types of things would change naturally, and what would have remained the same over the centuries. I wanted to make the world seem similar enough that you can tell it is the same civilization (militaristic, authoritarian, with some similar institutions), but not so similar that it is a weird caricature.  So I'd prefer not to have it chariot-related.  Really, it's such a minor point that I can just change it to ""truck."" Inventing a whole new type of car and explaining what it is would not really further the story and would just distract the reader from focusing on the plot. I often find that fantasy and sci-fi writers go on tangents to explain little details of the world that really don't matter."

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,yungcoop,3,Fri Apr 24 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"One question. What context is the word ""Advocate"" used? Am I supposed to assume he needs someone to speak on his behalf because he is in trouble or does it mean something else that I am unaware of. I'm just trying to figure out if that was supposed to leave the reader with an ominous feeling as to why the Emperor summoned Caius."

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,EyesNotQualified,40,Sun Mar 8 05:24:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   The way I figured it, Columbus was able to get funding for his expedition because Islam's control over the Middle East made luxury goods from the East too expensive. But if Rome never falls, the Middle East never really has a power vacuum, and Islam doesn't get big... then there is still access to the East. The main hub of trade would be around the Indian Ocean, and no one would have a reason to try going around the Atlantic. So the New World isn't discovered until much later."

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,anonymous_rocketeer,13,Mon Mar 16 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"I decided to put it into a timeline at the beginning. Not enough detail to really ruin things and make you not want to learn about the world, but enough that the reader gets a sense of the differences from the start."

I expect nothing less from you though!"
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Aqulight,2,Mon Apr 27 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"I know you are already advanced on this, but I would avoid the timeline.

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Reerhy1,2,Thu Mar 12 15:19:54 2015 UTC,When you write do you do an outline of some kind before starting? Or do you just start writing and make and in your head as you go?

You mentioned that the planes have propellers, and that flying close enough to see the their mouths gap open is the only way to see their uniform colors (ie no digital zoom). But you also mentioned tablet computers. And I think you mentioned drones that repair the planes. Are these future drones that we don't have yet?   Basically can you explain their tech level to me? Thank you :)"
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,youcouldhaveitso,21,Tue Mar 10 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"Basically, they advanced at different levels. Some things (like computers and medicine) advanced a lot faster. Others advanced more slowly than our pace. And it is primarily based on whether the Imperial government endorsed the use of that technology. Even private industry is dominated by huge state-owned corporations.   They were invested in lighter-than-air technology like blimps, and so they didn't pay much thought to heavier-than-air flight until much later. This subject does come up at one point in the book."
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,samgalimore,10,Tue Mar 10 19:51:29 2015 UTC,Wow that's great. I love that the technology is not all the same as ours (plus WWI dog fights are a lot more exciting than whatever we have today). Still curious about the drones reparing the plane. Also are they in the same year we are? Not that it makes too much of a difference.
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Sw1tch72,10,Tue Mar 10 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"The original prompt that inspired the story was that they are in the year 1999. So, close enough to now that it doesn't make a significant impact."

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,TheOriginalSoni2,7,Tue Mar 10 20:04:48 2015 UTC,"No problem! These are all things that I can only hint at in the book, because it's not like I can come out and state ""Oh, and flight was not nearly as developed as it was in an alternate timeline where Rome collapsed!"" I have to find ways of making it clear how the timelines have diverged while still making it naturally fit the story, which is difficult. But I leave a lot of it unexplained in the first chapter in the hopes that the curiosity will hook people into reading further."

They did have a few suggestions, which I'm working on now:   Need to raise the stakes for the main character at certain points; he gets a bit too 'safe.' Need to flesh out the main character's background a bit, as well as the background of one of his friends.  General grammar, typos, mechanical issues. That sort of thing."

The story is much more well built right now than the WP response and it is extremely great in making sure the reader is drawn in right from the very beginning! There's a lot of subtle nods and potential foreshadowing into things, which shows that either you have put some real careful thought into it, or you havent thought about it at all.

Oh and I love the style and how the military and the characters are used to set things up. Personally I would have preferred some paragraph or two to explain the minor characters before we meet them (like I didn't understand Lucullus' character fully until we were nearing the end of the meeting. A simple casual remark by Min Jae would have effectively sorted that out very easily, so you might want to think about that.

Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,lotu,2,Sat Mar 7 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"I love it so much! I have one super minor quibble with your wording at the bottom of page five, you just use the word ""revealing"" twice in two sentences and I'm a picky little bitch so I notice these things. I'm also confused about something in the same paragraph. He asks ""why did they pack his things"" but previously had to argue with them to get them to pack some stuff of his (the pictures of his family).  Overall though, it's incredibly well written."
Luna_Lovewell,2y98hn,Totobuis,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"The argument for bringing his family picture was likely a ploy to subtly tell that, while united, the east and west are still quite different culturally. Also, since he asks to bring the picture after he has wondered why they packed his stuff, there doesn't seem to be a timeline issue."

I have read, written, and edited a LOT of prose. This would be my first book editing, but I have edited theses before.   Speaking subjectively, I have a good sense of sentence structure. I also have a knack for knowing what ""sounds"" good and what ""sounds"" bad in written form.  As for anecdotes, many of my friends and family come to me when they need help with written English. I am often called a grammar Nazi. I consider this a badge of pride (sort of...grammar ""enthusiast"" might be better).  I also taught English for a semester.   EDIT: Oh! I also spent a lot of time in college studying Roman history and reading classical literature. I took three semesters of Latin as well."

I'd love to volunteer myself, but there are people who are much more qualified than me (not to point any fingers, but I am talking about u/No_Mas_Amigo). Sometimes being an engineer is really great, but then you look at a piece of paper (or a screen) with letters on it, and wow, wow, just no.

Ever sit quietly and just make up little stories about what peoples lives are like in your head? Like yesterday I saw a guy who pretty much looked like a bum from a distance, I started making assumptions about his life, then amended them when his female friend joined him. They walked closer and I realized how wrong I'd been and started a new story, after all a bum probably wouldn't be wearing a jacket with a couple hundred dollars worth of painting on the back, then I noticed the small sketch book in his girlfriend's bag and realized he might if his girlfriend was the artist, but how to explain her hundred dollar leather high heel boots and were those ripped clothes or ""artistically ripped"" ripped clothes. The deciding factor was his cologne, while he looked like a stylistic bum, )clothes explained by artistic girlfriend"" he smelled like a millionaire. Then I got into an entire train of thought about how creepy I must look to someone watching me as I sniffed (discretely) this guy and his girlfriend. Then I got paranoid and went back to my cave :)"

Secondly, as I get the feeling that it is needed of me to post some sort of credentials I will simply say that there are few things I enjoy more than a well flowing book and will therefor do my best to make sure that nothing slips through the cracks.

As one person may not be able to catch 100% of errors, I would recommend putting the book out to at least 3 different people.    Provided that they all use the same basic outlines for marking errors/typos then it should be possible to use a diff tool to compare all three therefor increasing the chance of any errors being caught across the three of them.    Still may not be 100% but it does increase the chances of catching everything.    Just a thought. :)"

Luna_Lovewell,2xq9w2,Jedi_Reject,4,Tue Mar 3 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"When the author intentionally mentions typos, and even goes as far as having characters in the story specifically discuss them, you can assume they are meant to be there. Luna includes in the expositional text that messages had to be kept brief, and the characters discuss how the incoming message incorrectly uses the word 'childs'.   Especially having read through the rest of Lunas recent work without noticing a single typo, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt here."
Luna_Lovewell,2xq9w2,MagicCityMan,3,Tue Mar 3 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"I did consider that, hence the 'not sure if they were intentional' remark. The specific emphasis on the childs error was what made me think they may in fact not be intentional."

Earth knows that they didn't send any tigers, that would be ridiculous, and if the colony was still active they would know it was ridiculous as well, but they didn't, which proved that the colony was no longer inhabited by the original owners."

Anyway, I found /r/writingprompts about a year ago and have read at least a story a day since then, and then I noticed most of my favorite stories were being written by the same person!

I wrote a lot this weekend; roughly 5,000 words. It was exciting, because I am at the climactic end of the book. There are so many things happening at once that right now, the challenge isn't thinking of what to write, but how best to order everything so that it flows together.  I think I will finish the first draft sometime this week, which is so exciting for me.   if I can get more of a backstory to the main character and his history in his training, so many things I want to know about the universe you've created.   Absolutely! As the advocate briefly mentions, Caius has been under surveillance his entire life. Well, those videos are reviewed and scrutinized during the Trials, which gives us some insight into his backstory and what the Senate put him through as part of their tests."

Or did you move the setting back or ahead a little? Also what are your plans for the book once it's finished? You don't seem interested in getting it published it seems but are you going to get any help with editors to find plot holes or spelling mistakes? Because I'd definitely help with that.

No, I changed a lot about the beginning. It starts off with him as a pilot on a reconnaissance mission. He comes back and meets with some of the generals in charge of the defenses in Japan (where there is an ongoing war, but more of a cold war), and they tell him that he has been summoned to Rome. Then they take him to the train station where he meets his advocate for the first time.   Also what are your plans for the book once it's finished? You don't seem interested in getting it published it seems but are you going to get any help with editors to find plot holes or spelling mistakes?    I would definitely like to get published, but I don't really know much about the process. I figure the first step is to actually write the book before trying to get someone to accept it. But I will definitely need help editing it at some point, so I'll probably be posting something in this subreddit asking for some volunteers (most likely after I have done my own editing)."

I am not a writer myself but I love to read. Everytime I'm bored and don't know what movie to watch I come to /r/writingprompts and just read. Outside of that I am currently reading more comics and science books. Been probably 9 months now that I read a full novel (probably should change that). Some other stuff: 19, male, studying computer science, from germany."

Luna_Lovewell,2xoai2,Sugarsmacks23,5,Mon Mar 2 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"May I ask how your hearing disability affects what you read? Are you drawn to descriptions of sights and smells that you are more familiar with, or do you like reading about sounds in stories that you wouldn't otherwise experience?"
Luna_Lovewell,2xoai2,battlestark,3,Mon Mar 2 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with sounds via vibrations and an assistive device (which I've been told that it is not the full experience of hearing). If I read a story that involves sound, the characters' reactions tells me more about the sound more than anything else. For example, when Harry and Ron went in the forest to find Aragog, Ron's reactions really illustrated the creepiness of the place.  Sometimes, I try to imagine the sounds and I cant, such as a pitch perfect notes like the ones Asaro mentioned in Carnelians or McCafferey's Crystal Singer series. However, it adds mystique to the story and I still appreciate it. Even with small descriptives like ""contralto voice"" or ""tenor whisper"", David Weber likes using that.  If you read a story about a creature that only sees in infrared like Predator, you can still imagine it. Another example would be  when Rowling described the blind Basilisk, finding Harry by vibrations alone."
Luna_Lovewell,2xoai2,SilhouetteOfLight,2,Mon Mar 2 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you.  I guess I had just never considered that kind of thing in my writing.

Used to be semi-interested in writing stories, partly because of my love for reading and partly because of wanting to be able to create the magic that good stories/books possess.

I guess this is pretty much why he's my favorite book author.   I started the Wheel of Time series a couple of months back, and I'm about halfway through Crown of Swords right now. I'll have to finish that before starting any new actual books, but I read plenty of short stories or WPs inbetween."

I think he is amazing at coming up with characters, settings, and stories in general. But I don't think he knows how to end them. He attempts to explain everything and wrap up all the loose ends, but for his kind of paranormal/horror/fantasy type stuff, I often think it is better to leave the details unexplained."

I tried to start a writers club about a year ago with the hope of working with someone on a story who had more of a passion for the actual writing.. but that didn't pan out the way I had hoped (i was the only one who did the weekly writing).

I was past the stage of having fun in nonsensical ways well before the rest of my grade, so instead I read. Fantasy and the like were my favorites, and still are, because this world just doesn't cut it for me.  I eventually turned to religion as a firm of giving the world making, which has helped with the depression some. That, and competitive martial arts. The traditional fighting community has some very accepting people, who value everyone and believe that everyone has the chance and the need to learn.  Now, my avid reading and likely linked heightened memory is serving me well in college, studying engineering. I still love the humanities, but I've accepted that I don't have a lot of skill in delivering stories on any medium, so I just situate myself near people who are more artfully inclined, yourself included.  I see myself as an outsider in a lot of ways, living in the hinterland of society, and thus able to make fairly insightful comments about human nature, society, philosophy, relationships, etc. Removal from the situation begets accuracy, as scientists tend to think.

All of the following were true at one point or another in my life:    I've been an innocent and I've been a pervert. I've wielded the Sword of Faith and I've forsaken holy vows. I've walked in the light and the darkness has known my name. I've been a man of faith and a man of science. I've dwelt in obscurity and I've repeatedly been on national tv.  I've worked in tech support and I've worked on the farm. I've had parents and I've been an orphan. I've been a son and a father. I prefer staying near hearth and home and I've gone on long, fulfilling journeys. I am the stable rock for those near me and yet my greatest fears come from within myself.   My reading I will describe less prosaically.  Grew up reading the short stories of Asimov and Heinlein.  One of my favorites was the 'Venus Equilateral' series.  My wife hates that I can plow through a standard paperback in around 2 hours.  For heavy reading I will go for something from Hawking or Dawkins.  For enjoyment I've been enjoying the Dresden Files and when I want pure fluff I've pulled out some of David Weber or John Ringo's stuff.  I'm a Whovian, a Browncoat, a Brony and a Trekker.  Musically, I have an eclectic taste.  Everything from hard rock to blues, jazz to opera, filk to country.  About the only music I don't have any fondness for is modern rap.  The old school stuff is great but the new stuff is just lame.

I've read a lot of philosophy, my favorites being ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" by Nietzsche and ""The stranger"" by Camus. Both not complete hardcore Philosophers like Kant, whose books I didn't enjoy reading. I'm reading ""Geschwister Tanner"" by Robert Walser right now. It's an astonishing book, and I love his writing style for its honesty and complete dedication to life and reality in a blunt but poetic way.  About myself: I am a 18 year old musician.

Luna_Lovewell,2xgm4x,Camdor5,5,Sat Feb 28 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"I'd seen a couple of your stories on /r/writingprompts but I had no idea how prolific of a writer you are!  Your stuff is great, and one of the coolest things about Reddit is the fact that content can reach people who would otherwise have probably never seen it.  Please keep writing, I just subscribed and look forward to seeing more of your stuff :)"

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Luna_LoveWell,793,Fri Feb 27 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"""Settle down, students,"" the headmaster said from her podium. ""The sorting shall continue as normal, and the feast will come shortly afterwards! I know that's what you're all waiting for!"" There was a ripple of nervous laughter at that, but most people were still just trying to get a better look at me.  Professor Lovegood removed the sorting hat from my head and held it as I stood from the chair. It was smirking at me, proud of the chaos it had caused. ""Don't worry, dear,"" Professor Lovegood said, ""Headmistress Chang will get everything all sorted out and then you'll be happy as a hoppermink!"" I didn't know what that was, but somehow it made me feel better anyway.  Another student came up behind me, waiting for their turn in the chair. I scooted out of the way and stood awkwardly on stage. All the other students had gone down to the tables of their newly chosen houses, but I had no table. I was all alone. I looked to Headmistress Chang for some guidance, but she was engaged in a huddled conversation with two more professors that I did not recognize. Just as I was about to leave the stage and go sit on the floor somewhere, she turned to me with a sympathetic smile. ""Let's head up to my office for a brief chat, shall we?"" I nodded, not really sure what to do. She turned to another professor on stage with a bushy grey beard: ""Professor Bancroft, please join us?"" Then she swiftly strode down the steps and marched through a side door; the grizzled old professor and I followed. I caught one last look of the rest of the students, standing on benches to get a glimpse of me while the professors tried to shoo them off.   She led me through the labyrinth of the school toward her office. I'd heard so much about Hogwarts before, but nothing could prepare me for this! The castle itself was enormous, and beautiful! But also enormous. How would I ever be able to find my way around here? Headmistress Chang seemed to know exactly where she was headed, even though the staircases kept moving around under our feet. But she'd been here for decades, which was about how long it would take me to find a restroom if I needed it.   We came to a halt at a hideous stone gargoyle. Headmistress Chang whispered into its ear and it sprang aside, revealing a staircase upwards. The office itself was enormous, crammed full of mysterious and magical objects that I didn't even recognize. I only knew the ones from my Harry Potter book, like Gryffindor's sword. The room was lined with bookshelves, but that didn't seem to be enough for Headmistress Chang: there were giant piles of them everywhere. She gestured to a seat in front of her desk, then dove straight into one of the piles. Her hands flew as she tenderly removed the tomes one by one, flipped through pages, and set each one back down in a different pile. The old professor, Bancroft, sat down next to me and seemed to fall asleep almost instantly.   After what seemed like an eternity, I heard her call out: ""Found it!"" She popped back up with an enormous grin, covered in dust and holding a book larger than an anvil (and probably heavier, too). Her arms trembled as she showed me the cover, almost too faded to read. I had to squint to make out the letters:  ""Parting of the Ways: The True Story of Hogwart's Founding.""    Part 3 on its way! Here is the link to Part 3"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Umpire,734,Fri Feb 27 18:16:05 2015 UTC,"The desk creaked and groaned as she dropped the book with a thud. I was worried that the legs might break, and scooted back so that my feet wouldn't be crushed. But luckily, it held.  Professor Bancroft grunted and stirred from his nap at the sound. I thought he might go back to sleep, but he perked up as soon as he caught a glimpse of the book's spine. He jumped out of the chair like someone had lit his coattails on fire. ""Is that..."" his voice trailed off in awe as Headmistress Chang opened the cover carefully. The cracked, worn leather bindings protested, but held. Around the room, all of the old Headmasters were jostling in their portrait frames for a better look. The first page was entirely taken up by a beautifully done portrait of five young wizards, perched on a cliff with their feet dangling over the edge. I realized that it was the same cliff I had seen just an hour ago as we floated across the eerie lake toward the castle after disembarking from the Hogwarts Express. They were sitting where the Great Hall now stood overlooking the lake.   ""Good god,"" Bancroft said. ""There's Godric, Rowena, Salazar, and Helga!"" He spoke about them like they were close personal friends, not thousand-year-old heroes. ""And that must be..."" He shoved me aside, trying to get a better look; his nose was practically pressed against the page. Headmistress Chang shot me a sideways smile and a shrug, silently apologizing for him. ""Yes, Heinrich..."" she told him, ""that's Althea Ambaret. The supposed fifth founder.""  ""How have I never seen this book before?"" Bancroft asked, suddenly angry at Headmistress Chang. ""I'm the head of the Magical History department here! I've been over every history tome in the library. Where has this been???""  ""This is a... delicate subject,"" she answered. ""The authenticity of it cannot be verified, and this is the only available copy of the book.""  ""Not verified?"" he asked. ""Couldn't we just ask the Sorting Hat? It certainly knew enough to place this young lass in her House, didn't it? And it has been around since the very beginning!""  ""Please,"" said Headmistress Chang with heavy sarcasm. ""Have you ever tried asking that thing a direct question? It only gets to talk once a year, so any other time you try, it will do whatever it can to keep your attention. It would certainly enjoy the game, though.""  Bancroft pondered that, then turned suddenly, scanning the pictures on the wall till he found what he wanted. ""Headmaster Lurant, you were the second Headmaster of the school. Was this woman indeed one of the founders?""  ""Absolutely not!"" the portrait answered. He, and a few of his peers (the eldest headmasters, presumably), were gathered in an ornate golden frame at the far end of the room as though they did not even want to come near that book. ""She was mad! She only wanted to be one of the founders, and they never wanted anything to do with her. That monstrosity should be burned to preserve the history of our great founders!""  ""The book tells a very different story,"" Headmistress Chang told Professor Bancroft, turning the page to the text.    Still going! Part 4 on its way. Part 4 is here!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,6xydragon,741,Fri Feb 27 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"""According to this,"" Headmistress Chang explained, ""Althea Ambaret was one of the original founders of the school. Not only that, but she claims to have come up with the very idea of creating an academy for young wizards. She wanted to establish a safe place where the most talented minds could experiment and grow in their powers with the advice and help from their elders.""  Bancroft grunted in response; he was still hogging the book, reading on his own. Luckily Headmistress Chang seemed to have read it a few times already and knew the story.  ""She had seen a number of other wizards who had been hurt and disfigured while trying to learn magic from their parents, many of whom weren't exactly experts in every field. Most wizards back then only learned enough to get by. And the other four founders shared that same idea, so they came together at this site and decided to train new wizards together.""  I nodded. Sounded enough like the history of Hogwarts that Mum and Dad had told me.   ""According to Ambaret, the others grew jealous of her. They were powerful wizards, but that does not mean that they knew anything about passing those skills onto others. They were too focused on writing down spells into books and rigidly defining the different types of magic. They didn't care about the evolution of the craft; just the codification of it.""  The portraits across the room were shooting her dirty looks. ""Allegedly,"" she corrected herself for their benefit. Bancroft hadn't heard a word she said; he wanted to read it all for himself.   ""Anyway,"" she continued, ""Ambaret didn't think magical education should work like that. She thought that students should be free to discover everything on their own, and that teachers should be more like mentors that they could come to with questions if they needed it. They would be free to create their own spells and potions, instead of just copying the work of the wizards that came before them."" I didn't want to say it, but that sounded a lot more fun than sitting in a dungeon reading all day.  ""And so, there was a rift between them. Ambaret claims that a number of pupils from the other four houses abandoned their work and came to study under her tutelage. And that this angered the other four, all of whom were allegedly arrogant about their abilities. They couldn't understand why any wizard would want to cavort with centaurs and go on foraging expeditions with her when they could be studying with the likes of Godric Gryffindor or Salazar Slytherin. And so they cast her out and scrubbed her name from the history of the school. And in the end, it was the remaining four who wrote the history books. Her Dragon symbol was expunged from the school crest, resulting in the one we know today."" She gestured behind her at the enormous shield hanging over her desk, displaying the Slytherin serpent, the Gryffindor lion, the Hufflepuff badger, and the Ravenclaw eagle. ""Although those four later on had disagreements over which students to admit, they all agreed on how magic should be taught, and thus their four houses remained together.""  ""Moreover, her wing of the castle was... removed. The book does not go into very much detail about this, but specifically says that it was not destroyed. Which means it is probably still around here somewhere. That is why I invited Professor Bancroft here, who has been conducting excavations around the castle and might be able to shed some light on this topic.""  ""What?"" Bancroft answered, looking up for the first time at the mention of his name. ""Oh, right. The excavations. Well, I've found...""  His eyes lit up like everything had just fallen into place. Headmistress Chang smiled, clearly showing that she'd already made the connection.   He turned to me with a roguish grin.  ""Young lady, have we got a surprise in store for you...""  Here's part 5!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,draculamilktoast,727,Fri Feb 27 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't think Bancroft could move this fast. When we were walking up to the Headmistress's office, he was barely keeping up. Now, he was like a racehorse charging down the steps. He wasn't even out of breath.  ""What a peculiar coincidence that this would happen just when I had found this section of the castle!"" I could barely hear him as he raced around the curves of the spiral staircase; his voice bounced across the stone and echoed back to me.  ""We originally started looking into it because that map that the Potter Family donated. It showed a passage down here in the lower dungeons that no one had ever used. We thought that we'd documented all of the entrances, but no one had ever even seen this one!""  We emerged from the staircase into a low, dark, arched hallway. Bancroft and Headmistress Chang produced their wand and said ""Lumos,"" sparking little bulbs of light. Glancing around, this section looked more like an old disused sewer than part of the castle.   ""So, I poked around here for a while looking for the tunnel. Have to say, the entrance was expertly hidden. Took me ages, but eventually I found it...."" His pace slowed, and he began poking at the wall. His wand tip made a sharp ""clack"" against the stones. After about a hundred meters of this, his wand tip sank into the wall like it was a moist sponge. ""Has to be with the wand, you see,"" he said with a grin. ""I was using my hands for so long that I never even thought of it!""   He stood back from the wall and held out his arms like a conductor in an orchestra. ""Magic is a treasure, to be carefully guarded,"" he announced.   Headmistress Chang chuckled at that. ""Pretty clearly set by one of the four founders we know,"" she said. ""That's pretty much the opposite of Althea Ambaret's philosophy.""  The rock in front of them began to droop and melted away like a candle left out too long, leaving a puddle of pebbles on the ground and a cavernous hole in the wall. ""Welcome to the 'Underdungeon,' as I've taken to calling it,"" Bancroft said with a grin.   The hallway arched upwards in a perfect semicircle. The rock walls were laced with thin, veiny lines of bright red stone that seemed to glow, bright enough to light the way. The tunnel descended downward in a slow, curving spiral.  ""There was a lot of debris in here,"" Bancroft continued. ""But not from the roof caving in or anything. It was all perfectly intact; we can only assume that someone filled it in on purpose. Took a while to clean out, but it's clear now.""  The tunnel was silent except for our echoing footsteps. I briefly wondered what the other students were doing upstairs. Probably enjoying dessert. Maybe the feast was already over and they were heading up to their House's common room. Where am I going to sleep? I wondered. Maybe they'll put me in with another House or something.  Those thoughts left my mind as we turned the last corner and I found myself face to face with a pair of red, glowing eyes, bared fangs, and a blast of heat. It was a menacing, snarling dragon.   Part 6 is here!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,MyfanwyTiffany,708,Fri Feb 27 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"I stumbled backwards, but Headmistress Chang caught me. My heart was pounding in my chest as I stared into the red eyes; I was so scared that it took me a moment to realize that the dragon was stone.  I panted as I exhaled; I hadn't even realized that I was holding my breath. ""Merlin's beard!"" I exlaimed, ""I thought that thing was real!""  There were four large columns at the end, and the enormous dragon was sculpted to look like it was wrapped around them; the tail circled the column to the far left, and its enormous head loomed out of the shadows between the two right ones. The burning eyes were actually enormous rubies, lit from behind by some sort of eternal fire. The fangs, sculpted from milky quartz, cast off light like they were dripping in slobber. The rest of it seemed to be made from the pure darkness, so black that it was indistinguishable from the shadows that lurked in crevices in the grey stone.  ""Where does the heat come from?"" I asked. We had only been here for a minute and I was already starting to sweat. It was like standing next to a furnace; my mouth was already dry and parched. I noticed little damp patches appearing on Bancroft's robes as well.  ""Well..."" he started, ""This is the part that you're probably not going to like."" He pointed across the room to the shadows within the dragon's gaping mouth. He aimed his wand, and a set of torches lit up, revealing a door, carved with the head of a dragon; its two horns were letters: A_A  ""Now, you see why it makes sense,"" Headmistress Chang said. ""Now I know who A_A is. I think this is Althea Ambaret's wing."" Bancroft nodded enthusiastically in agreement. I didn't quite know what to say.  ""What am I not going to like about it?"" I asked. Bancroft grimaced and pointed his wand at himself, then muttered something. His skin sparkled in the light as he stepped forward.  ""Just a harmless Flame Freezing Spell,"" Headmistress Chang assured me.  ""Flame freezing?"" I asked right as I found out why.  Bancroft had entered the circle in front of the door. From the dragon's mouth, a maelstrom of orange flames wrapped around him like a blanket, so thick that I could only see a shadow of his figure inside. Headmistress Chang placed a hand on my shoulder to make sure I didn't try anything stupid. The dragon's eyes danced in the firelight.  After a minute, the fires stopped, leaving Professor Bancraft unharmed but covered in a layer of black soot. He shook off like a dog out of the bath and grinned sheepishly as he stepped backwards.   ""The fire is some sort of lock,"" he said. ""From what I can tell, it will only open for someone deemed acceptable. I didn't really have any idea what it was looking for... until today. This is Ambaret's wing, so it would presumably open for you.""  ""Presumably,"" I repeated.   ""Err, yes."" He said. ""I haven't really had a chance to test it, of course. But don't worry; you'll have the Flame Freezing charm on you. It was invented after the founding of the school, so this trap was probably much more dangerous to trespassers when it was first built.""  After a moment's consideration, I nodded. He cast the charm on me, and I felt a shiver run down my spine; the tips of my toes and fingers tingled at the cold. I stepped forward, and the dragon's fire enveloped me too. I winced in fear, but didn't feel a thing. A face of flames appeared before my eyes with red lips, yellow teeth, and orange features. It seemed to smile, and I swear I heard it whisper ""Welcome home.""  The dragon's breath stopped suddenly, and the door swung open with a grating sound of stone scraping against stone. Headmistress Chang and Professor Bancroft smiled in encouragement, and I stepped through the door into Althea Ambaret's wing.   Here's part 7!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,erta_ale,666,Fri Feb 27 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"They applied the Flame Freezing charms once again and stepped through the dragon's mouth. This time it did not try to roast them; apparently opening the door was sufficient to turn off the flames. The room inside was filled with a dull, murky purple glow that I couldn't quite identify.   Headmistress Chang waved her wand in a slow arc, and tiny bubbles of light floated through the air like dandelion wisps. I was finally able to identify the source: the entire left-hand side of the room was missing. Where I expected to see columns and tapestries, there was a wall of thick, murky water. At the very bottom, a layer of mud and a few leafy plants poking up. Fish floated past, and I swear I saw a thick set of tentacles vanishing into deeper waters.   Taking a closer look around, I realized that the walls were not the same brick and mortar of the castle; the room had been carved into the stone itself, just like the tunnel leading down. In the center of the room, an enormous earthen bowl containing only cracked shells the size of a car's tire. Dragon eggs, I realized. Behind the bowl, an enormous hearth, large enough to fit a medium-sized tree trunk. On the mantle, a shield hung split into five sections, depicting the four houses of Hogwarts as well as Althea's dragon crest.  ""This was the nest!"" Headmistress Chang shouted behind me, also noticing the eggs and the fireplace. ""Althea's book mentioned that she had made her home at the school in a cave, home to some of Britain's last native dragons! This must be what she meant!""   ""Under the lake, though?"" Bancroft asked, gesturing at the looming wave that hovered over the room, waiting to crash through. A shimmering barrier, like a soap bubble, seemed to be holding it back, fortunately.   Headmistress Chang studied the barrier closely. ""I don't think that the lake was here. I think that might be thanks to the other four founders. They couldn't destroy her wing, because the cliff would crumble and everything they built would collapse. They just covered it up.""  The three of us continued looking around the room. Where I would expect bookshelves lining the walls, there were none. That was not Althea Ambaret's preferred method of teaching. Instead, they were lined with a series of demonstrative portraits. In one, Althea was riding her dragon with her long blond hair flowing behind her in the wind. In another, she donned large protective earmuffs, then harvested crying Mandrake Roots. The pictures were all designed to illustrate some magical procedure. Around the edges of the room, there were numerous stations with magical equipment for brewing potions and creating tools. There were also shelves and shelves of jars, which had probably been full of ingredients long since turned to dust. Elsewhere, rare minerals sparkled, and bones of mystical creatures loomed out of the shadows.   I meandered over to the far end of the room, where a plain dining table waited, still set with plates and silverware for the next meal that had never come. An enormous golden chair with a dusty, decaying velvet seat was perched at the head of the table. On the plate in front of it, a note waited. It was addressed to ""The Heir of Althea Ambaret.""  ""Headmistress? Professor?"" I called out. They turned from whatever they were examining, and I gestured for them to come over. ""You're going to want to see this.""    Here is part 8!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,JustAnotherSuit96,649,Fri Feb 27 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"""If you have found this letter,"" I read aloud, ""That means that someone has convinced those buffoons Slytherin and Gryffindor to relent in their persecution of my students, and they are able to return to their homes. Either that, or those two are gone and their descendents have seen the error of their ways and allowed House Ambaret to return to Hogwarts."" Well, close... I thought.   ""Helga was kind enough to warn me that the others planned to flood my home so that I and the dragons might never return. I have cast a shielding spell of my own design over the mouth of the cave, which should preserve this place until their narrow views are changed. I can only assume that if you are reading this letter, you have walked through my Fire and been deemed acceptable to study my methods. So, I congratulate you, and I welcome you to the fold.  If my followers have indeed been unable to return to Hogwarts, then it is up to you to re-establish House Ambaret. The Dragon Door shall obey your commands; we have no need of passwords and hidey-holes like those other fools. Stay true to our methods of discovery and ingenuity; do not fall prey to the temptation of copying simple spells from your forefathers. I wish you the best of luck in your studies and in your efforts to once again bring honor to this House.""  ""There is one last task that falls unto you. When Hogwarts was first established, each of us swore an oath upon our greatest treasure that bound us to the school."" I thought back to Godric Gryffindor's sword hanging in the Headmistress's office. ""When I left the school, I took my dragonscale cloak with me, despite Salazar's attempts to hide it from me. My flight broke the enchantment that we all cast together."" I glanced back to the portrait of Althea on the wall. Around her shoulders, an interlocking cloak of shining scales waved behind her as she soared on the dragon's back.  ""This is in the book!"" Headmistress Chang interrupted, giddy with excitement. ""She says that she took the cloak with her to Morral Fen Castle, and hid it in a place that only a true follower of her methods would be able to find!"" She looked ten years younger just thinking about it.  ""A dragon scale cloak would be exceptional,"" Bancroft pondered aloud. ""Nigh indestructible, immune to magic and fire and cold... Oh, sorry..."" he said, realizing there was more of the letter to read.   I cleared my throat and kept going:   ""I hope that I or my heirs will return it to the castle, but should that not be the case, it is up to you, my new heir, to reunite this item with its fellows and restore the enchantment's effects on Hogwarts.""  There was a stunned silence. I held the letter in front of me, not quite sure what to do with it. Headmistress Chang and Professor Bancroft were lost in thought.  ""Well, that settles it,"" she said finally. ""We need to head back up to the Great Hall. I have an announcement to make.""  Here is Part 9!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,NothingBig,786,Fri Feb 27 22:23:08 2015 UTC,"I stood on the stage between Professor Bancroft and Headmistress Chang's podium. Most of the other students stared back sleepily; they'd finished their dessert already and were eager to settle in. Only the first years were looking particularly alert, worried that they'd have to all be sorted again.   ""Students and faculty, welcome. I'm sorry that I have been detained for so long! The year has only just begun today and is already off to quite an unusual start!""  There was a rumbling stir of whispers throughout the room as everyone speculated what that meant. Headmistress Chang quieted them down and continued.  ""The world of magical education is constantly changing. New spells are found. New books are written. New potions brewed. And sometimes, old methods of teaching are rediscovered."" This time, it was the faculty's turn to look worried about where this was heading.   ""Today, we learned of such a method."" She produced the the book, 'Parting of the Ways: The True Story of Hogwart's Founding.' The thick, heavy tome hovered over the stage for everyone to see. ""This is the account of Althea Ambaret, the Fifth Founder of Hogwarts.""  There was a gasp from the audience, students and teachers alike.  ""She was forced out of the school by the other founders, who disagreed with her philosophy for how young wizards should be trained. Her house was abandoned and forgotten by time. Today, thanks to the Sorting Hat, this young lady, and the efforts of Professor Bancroft, it has been rediscovered. I am very pleased to announce the reestablishment of House Ambaret here at Hogwarts, populated by our very first pupil, and headed by our very own Professor Bancroft!!""  There was a round of nervous applause; Bancroft's eyes went wide, but he recovered it well and took a bow.  ""Throughout the coming year, these two will be conducting research into the history of House Ambaret and rediscovering her methods, as well as traveling on a few independent expeditions of their own. We will all work to accommodate them in whatever way we can, won't we students?""  This time, the applause was a bit heartier as the message sank in.   ""Now, on to practical matters,"" she said. ""This student, though in an independent house, will need to join with one of you for lessons, for meals, and for proper guidance from the prefects. Are there any houses that volunteer to assist her""  There was an utter silence in the hall. My eyes darted back and forth, hoping for any sign that someone would stand up. This was like being picked last for Quidditch. You could have heard a pixie's whisper in the hall.  At long last, a bench squealed against the stone floor, and a young man stood up. It was Paul Longbottom, grandson of Harry Potter's famous companion and current Head Boy! I blushed as he looked at me.  ""Gryffindor will host her!"" he shouted, to rounds of hearty applause from his companions. Headmistress Chang nodded to me, looking a bit disappointed that her own Ravenclaw had not stepped up. I rushed off the stage and sat down at the table, where I was greeted with a hundred whispered questions that were interrupted by the Headmistress.  ""That is the end of my speech! I sincerely wish you all the best possible year. Now, can we get this young lady some food?""  Everyone applauded, and a plate of spaghetti appeared in front of me.  It was going to be a strange year.    THE END! (for now!)  This was so much fun! You may have noticed that I'm a bit of a Harry Potter nerd!  I hope you all enjoyed the writing enough to maybe subscribe here to my subreddit so that you'll know when I pick this story back up again; I have a whole year's worth of story to cover in the future. And you should also check out my past Harry Potter prompts:    Bane (the centaur, not the Batman villain) is admitted to Hogwarts Snape teaches sex ed Harry Potter / Archer Crossover The Brooklyn Academy of Sorcery and Enchanting (Eight parts)     And finally, as another shameless plug: I am writing a book!

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,StarBP,63,Sat Feb 28 02:48:21 2015 UTC,I think you mean part 10 thru 1000 +movies
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,DaeronTargaryen25,141,Sat Feb 28 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"Wonderful story, just wish it wouldn't end yet"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,PenisShapedFruit,162,Fri Feb 27 23:03:32 2015 UTC,I think I left it open enough to keep going at some point! I just need a good antagonist for the story.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Jarmom,125,Fri Feb 27 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"More like, ""Wonderful introduction. When will the rest of the 7-book series/movie franchised be released?"""

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,darkPrince010,33,Sat Feb 28 10:33:08 2015 UTC,Here's the real question this raises: What are the two colors for the Ambaret House?
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,SuperWaffle24,83,Fri Feb 27 23:16:54 2015 UTC,Red and black. It's the Targaryen way...
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Jagasaur,36,Fri Feb 27 23:31:51 2015 UTC,Definitely Purple and Copper (To match Griffindor's Gold and Slytherin's Silver)
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,PenisShapedFruit,127,Fri Feb 27 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"Blue and black, or white and gold. Only a true Ambaret can see the crest as the former."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,NoAttentionAtWrk,13,Fri Feb 27 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"As much as id like black and red, purple and copper does seem to fit better."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Nakrl,11,Sat Feb 28 07:47:34 2015 UTC,Amber stone is orange and it sounds similiar to Ambaret. So i say orange/purple.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Pikalink1,31,Fri Feb 27 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Please PLEASE turn this into a full length book! You aren't legally allowed to sell it, but JKR fully supports full length fanfiction novels. The James Potter Series is a FANTASTIC example of this."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Alibear,31,Sat Feb 28 00:19:42 2015 UTC,"I liked your writing but for some reason I was jarred every time the main character referred to himself as ""he."" I would have sworn the main character was female, though I couldn't say why I thought so."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,FatFromSpeed,40,Sat Feb 28 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"I agree! I wrote the very first part (with the Sorting Hat) thinking of a boy. But for the rest of the story, I was just imagining a girl. I had to keep correcting myself, and I just went through a few minutes ago and changed it all to a female."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,MenionIsCool,9,Sat Feb 28 01:47:57 2015 UTC,wait it wasnt a girl? damn it i need to read better
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,bad_wolf1,58,Sat Feb 28 07:13:44 2015 UTC,"Fucking amazing. Write it into a book, and you will have all the support in the world. We're looking at the next Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,ItActuallyIsLupus,40,Fri Feb 27 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"A hundred times this. Seriously, just develop the character as more of a Harry than a Bella (ie, has their own thoughts and feelings and such instead of just being a tabula rasa), and maaaaybe have an intro chapter, with the Diagon alley trip and Sorting being Chapter 3 and the discovery of the house and Ambaret's letter being Chapter 3, and you have something that will hook anyone and everyone that has enjoyed HP (Hell, even moreso than HPMOR, since I think the levels of logical detail there might turn off some people)"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Do_not_dare_give_up,17,Fri Feb 27 23:34:15 2015 UTC,"Good god, you're an extremely talented writer. It makes me wish this was all canon with the series, it's so awesome."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,SchadenfreudeForTea,16,Fri Feb 27 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"DAE agree that r/luna_lovewell just reintroduced HP to my generation?? (I was born in 1987, I grew up with this!)"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,beardsandbeer88,16,Fri Feb 27 23:21:30 2015 UTC,I just realised Luna Lovegood = Luna Lovewell. She's one of my favourite characters in series.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Dauntless_Hero,6,Fri Feb 27 23:32:15 2015 UTC,MORE!!!
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,supersonic3974,8,Sat Feb 28 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"You are an incredible writer, I just want you to know that. I wish you the best of luck in your future pursuits."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,The_dude_that_does,5,Fri Feb 27 23:06:37 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,LickItAndSpreddit,5,Sat Feb 28 00:07:41 2015 UTC,I wonder if JKR has a reddit and has seen this
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,LickItAndSpreddit,4,Sun Mar 1 22:10:52 2015 UTC,That was really great! Lots of Harry Potter nostalgia for me. I want to read more!
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Mardam,4,Sat Feb 28 05:41:13 2015 UTC,I felt like a kid reading Harry Potter again. Please continue. Thank you.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Ishmael14,3,Fri Apr 10 10:00:03 2015 UTC,"This was amazing im so glad i subbed awhile back!  I just have a question though. In part nine, it says both ""today, thanks to the Sorting Hat, this young man, and the efforts of Professor Bancroft, it has been rediscovered."" and ""Gryffindor will host her"".  What gender is the main character? I'm assuming she since its used more than he, but I'm very confused."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,The_dude_that_does,3,Sat Feb 28 01:23:04 2015 UTC,Can I start a kickstarter to fund you in making this a full blown book?  Reading this gave me so much nostalgia. I felt like I was 12 again reading Sorcerer's Stone for the first time.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Ishmael14,2,Fri Mar 6 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I know I'm late to the party, but this is fantastic.  I'd love to see it developed more, maybe a novel!"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,mylazyworkaccount,2,Wed Apr 1 08:26:54 2015 UTC,"LOVE it!! I have one little gripe though... How is it that none of house Hufflepuff stepped up to host the young new heir of Ambaret? They are known as the house of hospitality and friendship, I'd expect them to be the first to go out of their way to accommodate and comfort any who have no other place to belong?"
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,StarBP,3,Thu Mar 26 20:56:16 2015 UTC,I just imagined that most of them don't really know how to react and don't have any idea what she is like. Gryffindor seems more the type to stick their necks out and take a risk.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,DzOker,41,Thu Mar 26 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't felt this compelled to keep reading something since I first read the actual HP novels. I feel 10 years old again, thank you."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,fb3playhouse,5,Fri Feb 27 22:42:47 2015 UTC,I could not agree more. If this taste is any indication of how good the rest would be I'll be very upset if we don't get more.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,I_Swear_Im_Workin,34,Sat Feb 28 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"As a lover of both Harry Potter and your writing, I would be interested in you turning this into a book. Also cant wait for your Roman Empire book."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,shortrug,32,Fri Feb 27 22:34:04 2015 UTC,Thanks! I am very excited to finish the book!

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Kiwi_King_Kaleb,9,Fri Feb 27 22:49:18 2015 UTC,It's a mystery.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,IowaFarmboy,2,Fri Feb 27 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Copy that, thanks.  Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss (or misread) something. And that I'm not an idiot.  Again, amazing story, and I can't wait for the rest!"

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Kal_Reegar,55,Fri Feb 27 22:28:49 2015 UTC,This better wind up being a full on book or 4.....we could crowd source it.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Adragel,20,Fri Feb 27 21:16:56 2015 UTC,or seven....
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,PenisShapedFruit,12,Fri Feb 27 21:23:30 2015 UTC,.....better than the original? It's definitely achievable.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,myrden,22,Fri Feb 27 21:40:20 2015 UTC,WHAT WILL THE LETTER SAY???
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,lulzasaur,203,Fri Feb 27 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"""The dress is white and gold."""
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,ghenne04,44,Fri Feb 27 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"But that is just the sorcery of the other four founders changing its text. Althea originally wrote ""The dress is blue and black""."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,quirkymonster,11,Fri Feb 27 21:22:21 2015 UTC,but they said it's black and blue

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,zaj209,7,Fri Feb 27 21:11:20 2015 UTC,You did say she read a book about Harry potter. Is the muggle world aware of the wizard world after the Voldemort event? With the high number muggle killings during his attacks it's possible they're aware. Just something else you can enlighten us on!
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Tee_Hee_Wat,2,Fri Feb 27 21:17:10 2015 UTC,Depends on whether or not she has a muggle parent.  :3
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,naizubadei,4,Fri Feb 27 21:10:20 2015 UTC,I really REALLY want this to be canon.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,andorrak,4,Fri Feb 27 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Why did I read this at work? My heart is absolutely racing. I cannot WAIT to read more. You've truly woven an original and fascinating take. Moreso, you've captured the ""gotta keep reading"" feeling the originals achieved so well.  Thank you...so much."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Spokemaster_Flex,4,Fri Feb 27 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Loving your stories, and find the coincidence between the story and my name funny."
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Meh_turtle,9,Fri Feb 27 21:12:41 2015 UTC,The Flame Freezing spell is one they mention in the books (although I might be misremembering the name). It's the one that wizards and witches used when the muggles tried to burn them.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,TanyIshsar,13,Fri Feb 27 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"As I'm sure I'm not the only one curious, you should do a bio post or an ama. ""I'm Luna_LoveWell, author of everything good on /r/writingprompts. AMA!"" Front page gold, right there. Oh, how much gold do you have now?"

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,gatoraid,5,Fri Feb 27 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"Quick question here then if you don't mind. Do you have a general idea of what the story is going to be about when you start writing or do you go with the flow? In the example of this story, did you think about the involved characters, the setting and the storyline of a secret founder beforehands?  Thank you for this great story!"

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,omgnotagainXD,7,Fri Feb 27 20:21:40 2015 UTC,Beautifully extrapolated. I love the way you've extended the mythology in a way that it just clicks into the existing universe with that oh-so-satisfying feeling. Good job!
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,TheOriginalSoni2,8,Fri Feb 27 20:17:23 2015 UTC,Thank you!   One of the hard parts about writing so fast is that it doesn't allow me to be as detailed as I would like. I am trying to tie it into the existing universe with things like mentioning the Marauders' Map and such.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Califish,6,Fri Feb 27 20:36:07 2015 UTC,Ive been a fan of HP since I was 10 (im 21 now) and after I finished reading the 7th book hours after its released I closed that part of my life off as it came to a close. But you sir or madam have reopened it today. Thank You.

Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,TheSunkenPirate,19,Fri Feb 27 19:29:41 2015 UTC,Althea Ambaret is a badass name.
Luna_Lovewell,2xdhvr,Gooflactus,18,Fri Feb 27 18:48:37 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was worried it was more French than British and wouldn't fit into the story. But I liked the sound of it.

Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,Luna_LoveWell,50,Thu Feb 26 14:12:38 2015 UTC,This makes me so angry. Good writing can do that.
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,The_Insane_Gamer,15,Thu Feb 26 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously, when do you have a book coming out? You spend so much time on reddit. Don't grrm us. Your first published book I will buy 2 copies of just because."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,Pimpin_Soi6,38,Thu Feb 26 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"The book is at about 70,000 words at the moment, and I have 2.5 chapters left to write. I'm getting so excited about finishing it! I've had the story all bottled up in my mind for months and finally it will all be out on the paper and complete. Such a good feeling!"
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,Pimpin_Soi6,8,Thu Feb 26 21:39:27 2015 UTC,Is there some kind of crowd funding site you can use? Based on the responses to your stories you could be paid to finish your book. I read reddit daily when I am bored and have downtime but it is really just filler until one of your tales pops up.
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,Cruxxor,14,Thu Feb 26 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Probably, but I am not really comfortable asking people for money for something that isn't finished. For all you know, it could be utterly terrible, and I would feel like I had cheated people if they were paying for something that just wasn't very good. I would be happy if people bought it once it was finished, which people will only do if it is actually good."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,aznspartan94,22,Thu Feb 26 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"Even if it turned out to be terrible, I still wouldn't regret giving you my money, since I had so much fun reading all your stories posted on reddit."

Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,iZacAsimov,1 point,Fri Feb 27 13:41:27 2015 UTC,Don't sell yourself short. Based on your current writings I and I am sure many others would kick in to get you writing full time
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,iZacAsimov,2,Sat Feb 28 23:55:26 2015 UTC,Aside: Will you be using Anno Domini to mark time?
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,fullofdharma,2,Fri Feb 27 00:24:16 2015 UTC,I'm still deciding that. It depends on whether I can find a way to work in a natural way to introduce the Roman calendar.
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,Dioskilos,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"If it helps, Anno Domini, before being co-opted by the Church, originally referred to Diocletian (under whom the title ""Dominus"" became an official one); a guy who rose through the ranks under Emperor Carus and as emperor, brought economic, military, political, and social stability to the empire after all those years of strife.  I'll let you get back to Ambaret."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8erl,SovreignTripod,2,Fri Feb 27 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"What do you think of this idea: instead of using AD or AUC, the date system will be based on when Augustus founded the empire. That way, dates aren't too far off from what we currently know (21 year difference) but also establishes the predominance of the Empire in Roman society."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,Luna_LoveWell,15,Thu Feb 26 14:56:56 2015 UTC,I need a sequel!  Ideally with Lana and Mallory involved.  It's not an Archer episode until the entire gang has stuck their noses into Archer's affairs wherever he is for absolutely no good reason and totally screwed everything up.
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,Kiteway,36,Thu Feb 26 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"Things it needs:   slutty underaged student Archer calls roll and gets to Longbottom Pam joins, mistakes something for cocaine Magic bloody marys Ghost sex Archer/Lana banter"
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,ElectricManta,11,Sat Feb 28 17:23:06 2015 UTC,Only thing I have trouble with is Archer wearing anything that could be described as 'ill fitting'.  Pretty sure he would have his robes custom made at $900 apiece. Gotta impress the witches...
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,ArZeus,6,Sat Feb 28 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"Spot on! I can imagine this as an episode. That being said, more pls."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,coindog08,3,Thu Feb 26 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"But seriously, it bothers me that Rowling never addresses guns and none of the defensive magic seems all that effective against them."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,bonly,1 point,Sat Feb 28 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"She didn't bother for the same reason we don't address utilizing weaponized hair-throwing tarantulas http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticating_hair  Sure it could be dangerous, but ... it's a bug. Who dies from a bug throwing hairs?   That's just as ridiculous as grinding up some rocks into powder, and then sticking the powder in a tube with a metal ball and setting the whole thing on fire. Somehow it gets hot enough for the ball to go flying out. How could anyone possibly aim such a contraption?"
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,Fakename_fakeperspn,3,Sat Feb 28 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"Realistically, she didn't bother primarily because it's both British and a children's novel. Wizards have fireworks so it's not like gunpowder is alien to them and Sirius is described as ""armed"" in an effort to inform Muggles that he's dangerous. Your analogy is not remotely accurate since Wizards are still human and live alongside Muggles. Unless there's some defensive spell they don't bother to teach students, guns actually seem more dangerous than the worst spells. This comes more from the fact that Harry Potter doesn't really explain anything and with the exception of potions every ""class"" is described as just rote memorization and practice so you never actually get to see how spells work either.  That's actually my biggest complaint about Harry Potter. The only schooling the children receive is the stuff that I absolutely hate and that I feel has always been somewhat useless (and it's even more useless now that we have Google). I mean in Harry's world creativity doesn't seem to have a place anywhere other than potion-making and intellect is defined as being bookish with a good memory."
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,bonly,2,Sun Mar 1 01:55:14 2015 UTC,"Wizards don't live beside muggles and they don't consider anything muggle-based as remotely comparable to the minimum a wizard can accomplish. They're wildly out of date and completely misinformed. Anything muggles do that wizards can't (ex spaceflight) is considered an exaggerated rumor, not factual. It's a social/cultural issue - muggles are inferior, so there's nothing to learn from them"
Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,Fakename_fakeperspn,2,Sun Mar 1 02:33:06 2015 UTC,There's way too many Muggle-born wizards for that to be the case...no reason arguing it though. The world is way too simple to have a complex discussion like this. You don't analyze children's books like they're hard science fiction.

Luna_Lovewell,2x8jcu,LittleHelperRobot,2,Sat Feb 28 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"Urticating hair:       Urticating bristles, i.e. irritating bristles, are one of the primary defense mechanisms used by numerous plants, some New World tarantulas, and various lepidopteran caterpillars. Urtica is Latin for ""nettle"" (stinging nettles are in the genus Urtica), and bristles that urticate are characteristic of this type of plant, and many other plants in several families. This term also refers to certain types of barbed bristles that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of a tarantula's or caterpillar's abdomen. Many tarantula species eject bristles from their abdomens, directing them toward potential attackers. These bristles can embed themselves in the other animal's skin or eyes, causing physical irritation, usually to great discomfort.

A good split point (if you haven't thought of it yet) would be the Sack of Rome in 410AD. The city of Rome was no longer the Capital of the Western Roman Empire, but it was a huge blow nonetheless. Maybe a diplomat was sent to the Eastern Roman Empire to offer terms for reunification and the ERE sent soldiers at a crucial moment to turn the tide during the battle as an answer.  If you've already come up with the point where history splits, then I'd focus there. The above was just a thought."
Luna_Lovewell,2wwkyb,4GreatHeavenlyKings,3,Mon Feb 23 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"The split point is the death of Emperor Carus. Instead of dying after a year in office, he comes back to Europe, scores big defeats against Germanic tribes, and reforms the Empire."

Having a novella based around then would give a glimpse into how history changed and what caused the deviation. You could also end it with an explanation or timeline of following events that led to the start of the main story. It could even double as a prologue for the finished book.  Regardless of what you end up using for the novella, I'm looking forward to it."

During his short reign, Carus fought the Germanic tribes and Sarmatians along the Danube frontier with success.  During his campaign against the Sassanid Empire, he sacked their capital Ctesiphon, but died shortly thereafter. He was succeeded by his sons Carinus and Numerian, creating a dynasty which, though short-lived, granted further stability to a resurgent empire.

Luna_Lovewell,2vg1jr,tyry95,19,Tue Feb 10 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"I pointed to the circle on the map that marked the White House.   ""If anyone will know what's going on with this situation, it's the President. Or it will at least be in his office. And we'll probably be able to find out other information, like if there is anywhere unaffected, or if someone is working on a cure. Just something useful, you know?""  The stranger looked back down at the map, considering my arguments.  ""You're right,"" he said finally. The engine roared back to life spraying dirt and grass behind the wheels as he steered back onto the road. We navigated around the circle and down Constitution Avenue, normally packed with buses of tourists and commuting federal workers. The road was lined on either side by hulking wrecks of cars that had been pushed onto the sidewalk by a tank or bulldozer or something; someone had made a path out of the city. Some of the cars still held their former occupants, leaning out of shattered windows or waving their arms from wherever they were pinned down.   ""You never answered what you were doing out there,"" the stranger said finally. I grasped the pen in my pocket and scrambled desperately for any excuse.   ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you,"" I said finally.   ""Fair enough,"" he said. ""Everyone has their secrets.""   We turned down onto 17th Street, passed the burned-out wrecks of the formerly grand buildings that faced the white house. A metal barricade had been hastily erected in the street with two machine gun emplacements on either side, but the outpost had long been deserted and a long trail of bodies leading up to the the shattered gate was all that remained of this bulwark.   We began to pass the remnants of a last stand. Soldiers in blood-spattered fatigues, still clutching at their guns and surrounded by gory remnants of their foes. Vehicles and equipment, forgotten in a headlong retreat that had ended poorly for many. Craters pocked the road from grenades and other explosives, and the formerly pristine veneer of the Corcoran Gallery was riddled like swiss cheese.   ""This doesn't look good,"" he warned me.   Finally we arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the most famous address in America. From afar, the white portico looked just as flawless and stately as the post cards. But the bushes out front had been scorched from the earth, and the lawn was littered with charred, blackened bodies. The car bumped and rattled ceaselessly as we drove over the bodies that covered almost every inch of the driveway. Finally, we reached the doors, sealed tight with a gleaming metal grate that had descended from the frame.   We stepped out of the car to inspect it. The stranger returned to the back of the hearse to fetch some gear; he held up a blowtorch and welding mask.  ""What do you think?"" he grinned.  Just before I could answer, an ear-shattering explosion erupted a few blocks away. A plume of smoke rose quickly over the tops of the nearby buildings. ""We're not the only ones here,"" he said quietly. ""What should we do?""  Go here for the next part and the next vote!"
Luna_Lovewell,2vg1jr,MyfanwyTiffany,23,Tue Feb 10 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"Vote for: ""Cut it open; we need to get inside, fast!"""
Luna_Lovewell,2vg1jr,mychinesesucks,19,Tue Feb 10 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"""Cut it open; we need to get inside, fast!""  The torch hissed and crackled as he slowly made his way through the metal barrier. I watched nervously as a horde of undead crossed Lafeyette park, hardly 100 yards from where I was standing. Well, huddling behind the hearse and pissing my pants would be more precise. But the mob was too distracted to notice us; they were heading to the site of the explosion, where a caucophony of gunfire still echoed through the streets.   The sparks stopped suddenly, and the center of the gate fell to the marble steps with a clang. I stepped through and opened the heavy wooden doors, stepping into the lobby. It was still lit, despite the fact that power to the rest of the city had been cut off long ago. The normally white walls were spattered with blood and bullet holes, and the polished tile floor was marred by a sandbag barricade hastily erected in front of the entrance. Some of the bags had clawed open (probably by the corpses slumped in front of the temporarily wall), spilling the grainy contents across the room. Mirrors in golden frames, already coated with a fine coating of dust, decorated both sides of the room; they made the columned entryway look infinite.  ""We should keep moving,"" a voice said in my ear. I spun, panicked, then looked back at the mirror. The stranger was right behind me, but I had been unable to see him in the mirror. He gave a knowing smile.  ""You were bound to find out sooner or later,"" he told me. ""Yes, I am a vampire.""  I backed away slowly, unsure what to do; I had no weapons or defenses.  ""Come, now. If I was going to hurt you, I would have done it a long time ago. I have plenty of blood in my hearse; no need for yours.""  ""How did you...""   My question was interrupted by a long bang from upstairs; maybe a heavy door being suddenly thrown open or something large being suddenly dropped. The vampire put a finger to his lips, drew his guns, and motioned for me to stay behind him. We crept slowly up the blood-stained staircase, listening to a series of thumps that reverberated through the hallways.  We zeroed in on the doorway where the noise was coming from. Just as the vampire gripped the polished crystal doorknob and prepared to open it, a desperate voice whispered from a dark doorway across the hall:  ""Don't open that!"" The door slammed shut immediately after, and we heard a lock slide into place.  The vampire looked at me, finger brushing the trigger of his pistol. ""Your call,"" he whispered."

Luna_Lovewell,2vg1jr,DrezGracer,15,Wed Feb 11 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"I gestured silently to the second door, where our mysterious warning had come from. The vampire nodded and wrapped on the door. The thumps from the door across the hall becae louder, more insistent. It must have heard us.  ""We're not going to hurt you,"" the vampire said through the door.   ""You'll never get in here! These doors are designed to withstand a battering ram! Just leave!""  ""We just want to talk,"" I chimed in. There was another thump against the door down the hall, so hard that I thought the hinges might snap. ""What's going on? What are you doing in here?""  ""What are you doing here?"" he retorted through the wooden barrier.   ""We just came for information,"" the vampire said. ""About the zombies. The plague. We figured that if anyone knew what was happening, it would be the President. That it might be here.""  Our mysterious companion didn't answer, and I noticed that the thumping down the hall had suddenly stopped.   ""I know what you're looking for,"" he said finally. The hallway was silent. ""I was one of the president's advisors, but I was left behind when they fled to Cheyenne. We hid down in the bunker...""  ""We?"" the vampire asked.  ""Me and some of the other White House staff. They... didn't make it. I waited for someone to come back, but they never did. Before they went, though, they were talking about getting a cure. A scientist up at the National Institute of Health thought that he had found the source. A 'patient zero.' But they were overrun before they could come up with a cure, and we lost all contact.""  The vampire nodded.   ""I'd heard about the NIH from someone at a university out in Ohio. That's what led me to DC in the first place.""   The deadbolt clicked at the other door, and our new friend popped it open just a crack. ""Let's get out of here, then. This place gives me the creeps now.""  Down the hall, the thumping resumed, more violent and rapid than before.  ""Shame that we came all the way here for nothing,"" the vampire said. He laughed and turned to me. ""Don't you want to sit at the big desk for just a minute? Be Commander in Chief?""    I have to go to sleep now, unfortunately, but if you all are enjoying it, I can continue the story tomorrow."

Luna_Lovewell,2vg1jr,El_Mono_Rojo,13,Wed Feb 11 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"""Sure,"" I replied. ""Let's go be President.""  The vampire grinned and marched back down the hall, chatting with our new companion. Just as I stepped down to the first step, the thumping resumed. But not the mindless crash of a zombie failing to comprehend how doors work. It was rythmic. Three quick thumps... then three long pauses... then three quick thumps. It took me a moment, but eventually I realized: morse code. The thumps were signalling ""SOS.""  I turned to tell the others, and saw the new guy at the bottom of the steps, watching me. He knew it wasn't a zombie.  ""I forgot the map upstairs,"" I said quickly. ""You guys head to the Oval Office and I'll meet you there in a second."" He nodded slowly and followed the vampire through a doorway to the left.   I rushed back down the hall and wrenched the door open, soon discovering the source of the thumps. In the center of the room, a man was bound hand and foot, with a tight gag and blindfold covering most of his face. He wore stained, torn army fatigues, and his hair was shaved in a close buzz cut. He writhed on the floor like a fish out of water.  ""Stop moving,"" I hissed as I pulled up his blindfold, wondering how far noise carried through the White House. ""He's still down there."" I rushed to the soldier's side and tried to pick at the knots, but they were too tight, and I didn't have a knife. I looked around the room for something to use, but the place was a disaster. Papers tossed everywhere, desk overturned, blood sprayed on the walls... Ahah! A single desk lamp lay on the floor, unblemished. I picked it up and smashed it against the side of the desk, and picked out one long, thick sliver of green glass that remained. I hurriedly sawed at the gag while he stared back, eyes urging me to go faster.   Finally, the last strand broke, and he spit out the lump of cloth that had filled his mouth. He gagged and coughed, trying to catch his breath.   ""He's not who he says he is!"" the captive managed to spit out at last.   ""What a shame,"" said the stranger's voice behind me. He was holding one of the vampire's guns.   ""He's a..."" the soldier managed to get out before being silenced by the deafening blast of the gun.   ""You shouldn't have come back,"" the stranger said to me. He almost did look regretful as he pulled the trigger again."

Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,Luna_LoveWell,209,Fri Feb 6 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"""Just watch!"" I told them, slurring slightly. It had taken a bit of practice to really get the technique down. 5 bottles worth of practice, if I was remembering correctly. The crowd floating in the lounge waited impatiently, skepticism written across their faces. The world was ending, and here I was showing them parlor tricks?  I focused on the bottle in front of me as best I could. I blinked a few times, and gently lifted my hands, leaving it floating in front of me. ""I'll just have to make this one last,"" I muttered to myself like it was some magic incantation.   ""Come on, Hughes..."" Williams interjected.   ""Shut it!"" I told him, not taking my eyes off the bottle. He was breaking my concentration.   It began to rock back and forth gently, then more and more forcefully, like a kid pumping his legs on the swing trying to climb higher and higher. The skeptics in the crowd grew silent as the bottle began to spin. At first, the change was hardly noticeable. A few tiny bubbles at the very bottom of the glass. Suddenly, white foam erupted out of nowhere. The bottle was filling much faster than the first time; it had already risen to the neck in only a few seconds. I turned back to the crowd, waving my hands at the bottle. ""I TOLD YOU!"" By my side, Rick was nodding enthusiastically, sipping at his own refilled beer. As my bottle filled entirely, foam spouted out of the top and floated through the lounge like tiny little clouds. Finally, the beer came to a rest, leaving an entirely full bottle.   The spectators erupted into a roar of questions and denials. ""I don't believe it,"" Williams muttered. ""Let me see that bottle!""  He moved toward the table, reaching out a hand to swipe it in mid air. I moved simultaneously to grab the bottle before he could get to it, but my hand just swiped through empty air. The bottle was floating the room on its own, straight into Williams' outstretched fingers. He wrapped his hands around it reflexively, but his face was more shocked than anyone else in the room.   ""What the..."" Rick said under his breath as Williams thrust the bottle back into the air like he'd accidentally grabbed some deadly poisonous spider. It spun towards the ceiling, spewing little droplets of beer.  ""How did you do that?"" I asked, pushing off the ground to chase after my magic bottle.  ""It just... came over to me,"" was all Williams could say.   ""Yeah, we fucking saw that!"" said Powell. ""But how did you make it come over to you?""  Williams didn't have an answer; he just looked back at his palms.  Rick looked at the counter across the room and thrust out a hand toward a tube of peanut butter, squinting his eyes in concentration. It slid off the plastic surface and shot toward his hand like an arrow. The room was absolutely silent while Rick triumphantly squeezed a bit straight into his mouth. He'd had a pretty good amount of beer during our practice session too.  ""Guys,"" I said, ""Something weird is going on here.""    Part three!"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,ChilledZero,224,Fri Feb 6 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"I concentrated on the empty boxes in front of me, picturing them full of food. Pacakges popped out of nowhere, arranging themselves into a neat stack in the box like I was playing a game of Tetris. I loaded the full carton into the lander and slammed the cargo door shut. We were all prepped for our return to the surface, at least in terms of supplies.   In the cabin, Powell was already strapped into his seat and adjusting his noise-cancelling headphones. His specialty was the most recently discovered of all of us: Abjuration, the power to create protective fields around oneself. It had come about quite by accident; Mallahan had been trying her hand at telekinesis, and accidently sent a screwdriver whizzing straight into Powell's face. But it had just stopped, moments from impact, like it had run into a brick wall. Powell was just surprised as anyone, but we soon had fun taking turns throwing anything at hand at him. Like the rest of us, his powers took concentration, and he'd have an especially important role in protecting the lander during today's descent; who knew what kind of debris we'd run into down there?  Though each of us had some mastery of every ability, almost all of us had found one particular subject of expertise. Mine, of course, was conjuration: magically summoning items, like beer. I was also able to heal wounds, as we found out when Mallahan first tried controlling fire. Rick's was illusions: tricks of the mind that could transport us to a whole different world in our imaginations. Perfect for a practical joker like him. Simmons' powers weren't perfectly understood, yet. She seemed to be able to affect moods and emotions, which had been quite a relief given the emotional turmoil we all experienced. Mallahan had the ability of divination: she could see the future! Shame that our abilities hadn't kicked in before the war. Only Williams had yet to discover his own specialty, despite  a month of trying. We all did our best not to show off in front of him until he was able to find his niche.   ""All set,"" I told Mallahan, who would be piloting us down. ""Mmmhmmm,"" she said absent-mindendly, engrossed in her pre-flight checklist despite having had a vision of us landing safely. ""We don't know if the future is set in stone,"" she had said, pragmatic commander as always. Rick entered, carrying the rest of his personal effects in a box and flanked on either side by two busty blondes in bright red lingerie. My jaw dropped, and Rick burst out laughing; the two visions swam and disappeared.   ""Send them back later when I have some alone time,"" I told Rick.   ""Only if you keep filling up my beers,"" he replied with his ever-present smile before entering the ship to place his belongings.  By the time I'd cleaned out my own bunk, the rest of the crew was ready to go. Mallahan sat in the pilot's seat obsessing over the instrument panel. Williams was in the co-pilot's seat, looking like he was getting ready to vomit. The door was already covered by a shimmering barrier like it was trapped in one giant soap bubble that popped as I stepped through. Powell's eyes flashed open in annoyance, and I waved an apology. Rick and Simmons were already seated, but greeted me warmly as I took my seat.  ""All right, everyone,"" Mallahan said, finally ticking off that last box and sealing the door with a whoosh and a click. She turned back to face the other passengers:  ""We all ready to go home?""    Part 4!"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,ericwdhs,167,Fri Feb 6 20:56:46 2015 UTC,"There's a reason I became a drone engineer, not a pilot. I felt like a can of paint being mixed at the hardware store. The shuttle rocked and shuddered violently as if it could fall apart at any minute. I clutched my vibrating seat like my life depended on it. Somewhere behind me, I heard the insistent rattling of something metallic. What is that? Did part of the ship break loose? Oh god, we're all going to die! Through the windshield, I could only see the a dull orange glow as we burned through the atmosphere.  Just when I thought that I couldn't take it anymore, Mallahan pulled the ship up, aiming toward space again. The broad underside of the ship sailed through the atmosphere, slowing rapidly. Instead of flames, I saw the familiar black background dotted with stars that I'd been staring at for months. I managed to breath normally again once the rattling stopped, doing my best to pretend like I wasn't having a panic attack.  ""Simmons, a little boost?"" I managed to gasp. Immediately, a wave of calm washed over my body like slipping into a warm pool. I felt more relaxed than I'd ever been in my life, even when I'd had some pharmaceutical aids. ""Oh yeah, that's the stuff,"" I said, struggling to move my mouth as I fought against how relaxed all of my muscles were. The shuttle dipped down again toward the ground as we reached an acceptable cruising speed. The fires had died out over the past few weeks, leaving most of the world scorched and black. America, Europe, and Asia were a complete loss. Africa, Australia, and South America had been spared most of the bombing, but the choking dust and ash had blanketed those continents pretty thoroughly. We had decided our best shot would be to head for New Zealand; it was the only viable location we could think of that would have an adequate landing strip and hadn't been directly in the fallout zone.   The shuttle continued to slow as we streaked over the sparkling blue sea. Despite everything, it remained just as beautifully blue as before. It somehow gave me hope that maybe things would heal. Years and years from now, when the radiation passed.   ""Prepare for landing,"" Mallahan announced. We were still hundreds of miles away, but the autopilot was already dropping the landing gear and lining up. This time, I didn't even break a sweat; Simmon's calming influence was better than sitting on a beach drinking a mai-tai. The lander bounced and rumbled down the runway, giving off a screeching squeal as it slowed as quickly as possible. Mallahan's hands were whizzing through the cockpit, manipulating every instrument and button possible. At long last, we skidded to a halt, just where the black asphalt met the lush green grass surrounding the airport.   In front of me, Powell relaxed suddenly, dropping the barrier around the lander with a sigh. Mallahan popped open the door, but we kept our helmets on until we could get out the geiger counter.   ""Low levels,"" Rick announced as we stood on the runway. Powell took a deep breath again and waved his hands like he was parting the Red Sea. The air shimmered again and lifted a small haze of dust, causing the geiger counter to fall silent.   ""Man, you are handy,"" Williams remarked.   I stared up at the slate-grey sky; the normally brilliant blue was tainted by ash and dirt.   ""So, where to now?""    Part 5!"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,Lazy_Rebel,94,Sat Feb 7 02:29:24 2015 UTC,"We didn't have time to discuss our options before the survivors arrived. A convoy of military humvees tore through the locked gate outside the airfield and came to a screeching halt on the emerald green grass next to the lander. As the doors open, we realized that they wore civilian clothes. But the guns they were carrying were another matter altogether.  ""Everyone get back to the ship,"" Rick said quietly. ""I have an idea."" As I stepped back, an image of me stayed exactly where I'd been standing; it was like a snake shedding its skin, leaving a perfect, hollow replica. Rick was slowly walking backwards next to me, holding his hands out like controlling a marionette and whispering to himself.  ""Which country are you from?"" barked the leader of this new group. ""What do you want here?""  ""We were on the orbital construction station,"" Rick muttered under his breath as we reached the threshold of the lander. The illusion version of Mallahan repeated what he said, mimicking her firm, authoritative tone perfectly. ""We were unaffected by the war, but we were originally from the United States.""  ""So you were in orbit? The radiation didn't give you any powers?""   Rick looked to Mallahan, waiting for orders. The strangers lifted their guns, pointing them menacingly at the illusion of the group. ""Well?"" The leader said, eyes narrowed.  Mallahan bit her lip, looking uncertain for the first time since I'd known her. ""All right, tell them,"" she whispered. ""Powell, get a barrier up around us.""  ""We did get powers,"" Rick said, repeated by his copy of Mallahan. ""I can see the future, and Hughes here can summon food out of nowhere."" He conveniently didn't mention the illusions or the shields. My view shimmered and became slightly fuzzy, like looking through a wet window, a bit as Powell's bubble wrapped around us once again  ""I see."" The leader looked closely at Mallahan, sizing her up. ""Take them!"" he ordered his followers, who marched forward with handcuffs drawn.  ""Get ready..."" Mallahan warned. ""Fire should do the trick. Try not to hit the vehicles.""  The strangers approached the ""group"" and tried to shackle Williams first. The look of confusion on that guy's face when the cuffs went straight through the illusion's wrists was priceless. The stared down at his hands in dumb confusion. Just when he yelled out ""It's a trick,"" Mallahan ordered us to attack. There was a burst of gunfire. Tiny flashes of sparks in my palms turned into a river of flames as I and the others sprayed fire at the strangers, burning them to a crisp. After only a minute or so, we emerged again from the lander and moved toward the charred, black circle in the grass next to the runway. Horribly twisted corpses reached up like they could capture us even in death.   ""All right, everyone,"" Mallahan said finally. ""We need to make our way up into the hills; that's where I've seen us in my visions. I don't really know why, but I guess we'll find out when we get there. Everyone, move out.""  I summoned backpacks and we all loaded them up with supplies. Well, almost all of us. Williams seemed rooted to the spot standing over one of the stranger's bodies. I turned back to ask him to come give us a hand, and noticed his mouth moving, like he was whispering to it. He slowly took a knee, down in the blackened dirt. Just as he was about to touch the charred body, I called out: ""You gonna help, Williams?""  He stood up in a flash and turned back with an almost guilty expression.   ""Of course,"" he said, rubbing his forehead in confusion and heading back over to the lander. ""Sorry, I don't know what came over me."""
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,Lazy_Rebel,60,Sun Feb 8 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"We commandeered their vehicles and found a route up to the top of the ridge where Mallahan had seen us in her latest visions. I could tell that this area had once been beautiful and lush, but the trees and plants were droopy and dying after a month or so under a cloud of ash. The island itself had been mostly spared from the bombs, but burning debris that had been thrown into the stratosphere was unavoidable. Black scars were clearly visible where the fires had raced up the countryside, eating everything in their path.  ""This is it!"" Mallahan announced as we reached the top of an unremarkable hill overlooking a pleasant rural valley with a small town in the center.  ""Now what?"" Rick asked. All eyes focused on Mallahan. It was her vision.  ""I'm not exactly sure. I just saw us driving up and stopping here. I don't know what we do next...""  We all looked around for anything remarkable that might draw us to this location. Mallahan's visions usually signaled something important, or signaled when something important was about to happen. Here, there was just ash-laden wind and emptiness.  ""There's nothing here,"" I told Malahan.  She sighed and nodded in agreement. ""Let me meditate and see if I can get another vision."" She brushed off a thin layer of ash from a spot on the ground and settled in, closing her eyes and slowing her breathing.  ""Everyone else spread out,"" Powell said. ""See what you can find."" Williams was already wandering off a few meters down the road, like a curious dog drawn to some strange scent. He disappeared into a thick grove of trees while the rest of us scattered in various directions.  It was only a few minutes before we all heard Williams call out. We rushed into the woods after him and came to small clearing line with naked trees. They had been stripped of foliage and blackened by fire, but this looked to be done on purpose. Around each thick trunk, metal chains were tightly circled around burnt human remains, binding them to the tree. In the center, a telephone poll had been repurposed as a stake, and the unburnt body of a young woman was marked with a one-word sign: DEMON.  ""Oh, god,"" Rick said, covering his face. The smell was unbearable.  ""Over here,"" Williams said, standing on a large mound of dirt at the end of the clearing. Beyond, a yellow excavator sat abandoned before a large, recently-dug pit full of more bodies.   ""What the fuck happened here?"" Simmons asked, more rhetorical than curious. She was working overtime to keep us all calm and relaxed in the face of this massacre. It was pretty clear what had happened, especially given the attitude of their welcoming party at the airport and their questions about the powers.   ""They were killed for having powers,"" Williams said. ""She told me.""  We looked at him inquisitively, but no one asked. Was he going crazy?  ""Yeah,"" he responded, even though no one had vocalized the question. ""I found my specialty.""  He walked to the corpse at the center of the clearing and tapped lightly against the already-rotting skull with just one finger. The chains rattled as she twitched violently. Decrepit muscles jumped back to life and the decaying skin tensed up against the chains as she tried to stand. Her mouth opened, emitting low, haunting moan as a purplish glow surrounded her.   Williams could resurrect the dead."
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,watchadoooin,52,Wed Feb 25 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"""This is just wrong,"" Simmons said. Even her powerful soothing was no use against the feeling of revulsion and horror that we all felt while watching Williams converse with the tortured corpse. Rick had to leave the clearing and go vomit when part of her jaw disconnected during the story of how any townsfolk who showed abilities had been rounded up and killed. The corpse didn't notice or didn't care about how disgusting we thought it was.  ""Oh, come on,"" Williams protested. ""The rest of you get amazing powers and it's all awesome, right? No one thought it was unnatural that Simmons here can manipulate your every emotion, or that Rick can trick you all into seeing whatever you want. Those are far more destructive and unnerving than mine!""  ""I agree with Simmons,"" I chimed in. ""The dead are meant to stay that way. The way that they obey your commands with that haunted, disturbing look in their soulless eyes... I mean, I'm not a religious man or anything but this is straight up... blasphemy. I don't know.""  ""Blasphemy?"" Williams shouted back. ""Christianity is founded on the idea of bringing a guy back from the dead! And Jesus even did it himself, with Lazarus! How can you accuse me of blasphemy?""  A gust of wind swirled around the mountain top, causing the line of corpses along the road to sway slightly. Williams had insisted on raising them all up and bringing them along, saying that they didn't deserve to be thrown in a hole like rubbish. The purple glow surrounding them made them kind of glow in the dark. I shuddered and turned away, trying to forget that they were there.   Mallahan had stayed silent the whole time. She was frustrated that she hadn't had a vision, and didn't know why they had come here. Williams was trying to convince her that discovering the bodies was the point, but Rick and I vehemently disagreed. ""There are bodies all over the planet,"" I argued. ""Why bring us here?""  ""Enough!"" Mallahan yelled. ""I'm sick of the bickering. We're going to camp here, and then tomorrow we will decide what to do. Williams, you can keep your zombies as long as they stay out of the camp and don't bother the others.""  We ate dinner in silence while the mob of corpses waited on the outskirts of the fire, just waiting. Staring straight ahead at nothing. They had no need for food or water or sleep, and they would only speak to Williams. Simmons was visibly shaken by their presence, and having trouble controlling her power. Instead of being able to soothe any of us, her terror had become infectious and overwhelming. Rick was off in his own little dream world, sinking deeply into the illusion in an attempt to avoid the undead surrounding him. I summoned blankets and tents for everyone and tried to get some sleep. I would have preferred four walls and a bed, but my powers could only go so far: buildings and furniture were too complex.     I was shaken awake sometime in the night by Mallahan, hair streaming out wildly like a mad woman. She had a crazed, excited look in her eye and a huge smile.   ""I had a vision,"" she told me. ""Come on, we have to move.""  ""Move?"" I managed to ask, still groggy and not quite thinking clearly.  ""Yeah! We need to get out of the way!""  She gestured behind me, where I could see the horde of zombies shuffling in the firelight.   ""They need to dig. It's under us!"""
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,Lazy_Rebel,51,Wed Feb 25 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"The hill was leveled in almost four days.   I had summoned hundreds and hundreds of metal shovels for them. We hadn't realized it before because we had always used it in such small doses, but our powers were incredibly draining. After shovel #300, I had to just stop and take a break for a few hours. Not that it mattered to the undead; they just clawed at the earth with their hands, not caring that they were scratching their own skin off. But they had worked around the clock, never stopping or tiring. We only gave them tools because it made it faster.   Mallahan was watching eagerly. She'd hardly slept the past few days. This must have been a doozy of a vision, because I had never seen her so excited about anything in her life, and I'd been there when it was first announced that she'd be going into space. She said that there was some kind of building underneath this hill. An ancient building, far older than any of the ruins that we were familiar with. She tried to explain what it looked like, but gave up frustrated when we just couldn't picture it. ""You'll see when we unearth it,"" she said at last.   Williams had been excited too, for different reasons. He and Rick and Powell had been traveling the countryside, looking for more and more bodies. He was like a bloodhound; they ""called out to him,"" he said. He could hear their voices even from far away. I hadn't seen them in at least twenty four hours, but a steady stream of purple-tinted corpses coming down the road indicated that they were still finding ""volunteers.""   A loud ""CLANG"" echoed through the dig site, and Mallahan perked up like a dog detecting an intruder. Even the zombies seemed to notice that this was something important; they seemed to all pause temporarily as if awaiting new orders. Williams must have just ordered them to dig until they hit something, and their eerie collective mind somehow knew that this was it.   ""Keep going!"" Mallahan was screaming. They looked right at her and seemed to just stare straight through her. Most of them were clutching their shovels, and I had a brief moment of panic as I realized just how little we knew about this weird magic. I'd seen enough zombies films to know that the undead weren't usually friendly, and maybe it was only Williams keeping them at bay. Maybe they'd bludgeon Mallahan to death with those shovels just for trying to order them around.  They went back to work. I exhaled in relief, suddenly realizing that I'd been holding my breath the whole time. Mallahan and I walked to the center of the crater (well, that's what it looked like, at least,"" where a chunk of diamond surrounded by shining metal was beginning to reveal itself from under a crust of dirt."
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,YoungReady956,47,Wed Feb 25 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"By now, there were thousands of them, swarming over the temple like ants on a dropped piece of food. By my side, the entire crew was reunited, minus Simmons. We sat on what remained of the hill overlooking the crater and admired the structure.  Mallahan had been right; it really was indescribable. The best comparison I can think of would be the result of blending Superman's Fortress of Solitude with one of those beautiful Japanese pagodas, and maybe mix in one of those Gothic cathedrals from Europe. It sounds like a ridiculous combination, but it was actually quite beautiful. And it seemed like every inch of the building (at least, the parts that we had uncovered) was covered in writing. Some strange text that none of us recognized. Squiggles and lines and angles that made no sense, but were strangely logical and familiar. Like trying to read the last line of an eye chart, where you feel like you could understand it if you just looked a little closer.  Today was a special day, though: we had uncovered the door. At least, what looked like it. Hard to know. The rest of the building was sealed tight. No doors or windows anywhere. But Mallahan had assured us that there was a way in; her vision had ended with us walking inside. And according to her, the wide, arched entryway looked just about right.   Williams had directed the zombies to focus on that area, and they had shifted like a school of fish. Their single-mindedness was terrifying to everyone except Williams. He didn't seem bothered by their slavish devotion to him, or by the fact that their bones were beginning to poke through what remained of their flesh. Simmons outright refused to be near any of them, and lit a few on fire for getting too close. To her dismay, they hardly seemed to notice at all. The skeletons kept on walking as normal once all of the meat burnt off. Instead, she had me erect a little bunker for for her at the top of the hill, and sealed herself off from the rest of us.   Mallahan was pacing eagerly between the streams of zombies carrying loads of dirt away from the door. ""Can't you get them to go any faster??"" she urged Williams, who answered ""No"" for the hundredth time.  As soon as it was ready, Mallahan pounced. She shooed the undead workers away as they tried to clear the remaining piles of dirt around the periphery. Williams waved them off casually while Mallahan struggled at the door. We all grabbed onto the handle and pulled with all of our might.  The door barely opened a bit with the painful sound of metal screeching against metal. But it was big enough to get us through. We all fell back panting into the dirt except for Mallahn, who let out a squeal of delight and jumped through the crack into darkness. There was a moment of silence, then we saw a soft orange glow as she summoned some fire that danced playfully in her hands.   ""Come on in,"" she told the rest of us. ""You have got to see this!"""
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,ianjthor,48,Wed Feb 25 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"The fire in our palms only illuminated so much, but what we could see was amazing. Soaring columns, decorated with the same writing that covered the outside of the building. The floor was made up of weird tiles like a jigsaw puzzle on drugs, but was strangely beautiful. The entryway was lined with enormous onyx sculptures that looked down judgingly at us. Their faces were horrifying in the flickering light.   The entryway opened up even further as the horde of zombies managed to wrench the door open all the way and came pouring in after us.   ""Williams, get those out of here!"" Mallahan hissed.  ""Why?"" he asked. ""They could be useful.""  She sighed, not wanting to fight it. He had a point, but they were still unnerving. She'd kept it under control while they were digging for her, but I suspect that she hated having them around almost as much as Simmons did. Speaking of which...  ""Hey, someone should go get Simmons,"" I told the group.   Mallahan looked up from studying one of the plaques under the statutes with a look of confusion. ""Oh, right,"" she said like she had forgotten all about the remaining member. Powell, go get her."" He nodded and headed back outside, parting the crowd of zombies streaming inside like Moses before the Red Sea.   We moved to the interior, where one massive dome rose up above us, so high that I could only see a pinpoint of light and a spray of color at the very top where light was refracting through that massive diamond we had seen. In the center of the room, an enormous obelisk rose up in front of us. It was made of the same black stone as the statutes, but all of the letters were lined in gold leaf, reflecting the light easily.   ""Hughes, anything you can summon to make this easier to read?""  Flashlights and pretty much anything electric would be impossible, but I conjured huge piles of brush and timber around the room; Rick followed behind me and set them alight. Soon the room was full of crackling pyres, bright enough to see the obelisk more clearly. Behind us, the entryway had been packed by Williams' army of undead. Even their rotting, expressionless faces seemed awed by the Obelisk.  ""Guys,"" Mallahan said. ""I think... I think I can read this."" I turned back, where she practically had her nose pressed up against the stone, and was stroking it lightly with her fingers. Rick and I lit the last pyre and came closer. The gold-lined letters seemed to dance and swirl in the firelight... and started to make sense to me, too. First, just words. ""Magic,"" and ""abilities,"" and ""Summon."" Then sentences. Then paragraphs. It wasn't English or any language I was familiar with, but I just knew what it said in my bones. Mallahan, Williams and I were studying it closely, but Rick was backing away.  ""This is too much for me. This whole thing just doesn't make any sense.""  We were too busy trying to comprehend to listen to him. I traced my fingers down the side. Mallahan spoke out loud, the first to have everything fall into place:  ""...  have been encoded in humanity's genetics. The abilities can only be used by maybe one in ten thousand. But the power source is limited. When spread out over so many, the essence becomes weak; only strong enough to perhaps enhance one's luck or make a small nudge every now and then. With millions on the planet, those with abilities will be successful, but unable to access their full range.""  Well, that explains why the powers only came to us after the war. And I guess how everyone on the station had powers; you had to be pretty accomplished to get a spot in orbit.  ""I fear that with the growing population of the planet, the cycle of conquest and rebirth will end. If the essence is too diluted to be of any use, then no victor may rise and vanquish their peers. With so many of them alive, then the power will never be concentrated again. There will be no ONE to ascend.   Mallahan stopped reading and looked back at us. I was seeing the same message on my side of the obelisk, and Williams confirmed that his was identical as well. ""What do you make of it?"" she asked.  Rick laughed from his corner of the room.   ""It means,"" he said slowly, ""That everyone else out there with powers is meant to kill each other. We've got a Highlander situation here.""  I thought back to the crew on the airport tarmac, asking us if we had gotten abilities. Did they know? They'd asked about radiation, which had been wrong. But were they working for someone who knew?  I was so lost in thought that I did not even notice the zombies begin to rustle and inch forward."
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,ShadowPouncer,65,Wed Feb 25 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"They had been standing in the entryway, awaiting orders in neat rows like arranged tin soldiers. But now they were marching forward, determined and relentless. The pyres cast horrifying shadows across their faces. Their arms raised in unison, reaching out to us.   ""Williams..."" Mallahan called out as she retreated across the room, ""What are they doing?""  Williams, though, had slipped into the throng and escaped.  ""I'm sorry to do this to you all,"" he said, hiding amongst the undead. His voice echoed through the cavernous building. ""But you read what that pillar said. There's only so much of this essence to go around, apparently. And it's not like you enjoy having me around anyway. What were you planning on doing with me once you no longer needed my undead army for digging?""  ""Williams, stop this right now,"" Mallahan called out. She sprayed a gout of fire at the approaching line of shambling corpses, but it didn't really do anything. The flesh burned, but they were no longer constrained by physical pain. Their skeletons continued to march forward. ""Order them to stop, Williams!"" Her voice was getting high, desperate.   I summoned a sword, the only weapon simple enough for me to bring into the world. Rick and Mallahan joined me, and I conjured blades for them to. We stood in a line as the zombies came within arm's reach. Mallahan nodded, and we begin to slice and hack our way through, cleaving off limbs and heads. It didn't matter; the severed hands still grasped at us from the floor, and the mob continued pressing in from all sides.  ""Rick... you need to send a message,"" I whispered. ""Send an illusion up to Simmons' little bunker and warn her about Williams. She and Powell need to find a way to seal this place up, or kill him, or something like that. Can you do it?"" He nodded and closed his eyes; Mallahan and I stood in front of him, doing our best to dismember any zombie who came close enough.   They grabbed Mallahan first. A torso that had been knocked to the floor, separated from its legs, had managed to grab her ankles. She went down hard, landing on the pile of bones in front of her with a clatter. They swallowed her up almost instantly, wrenching the sword from her grasp and plunging it into her chest. She screamed in pain, but I felt a surge of power flow through me. The 'essence' that she had been using was like a jolt of lightning through my veins. I tried fire again, and this time it literally blasted the zombies apart in front of me like I'd used a grenade.  I could only hold them off for so long, though. Williams had gathered a seemingly endless supply over the past few days, and there were bodies advancing toward me as far as the eye could see.   Skeletal fingers wrapped around my wrists, holding me in place. Zombies surrounded me; the smell of rotten, decaying flesh was overwhelming. A tall corpse stood over me, wielding my sword with his left hand; the right arm dangled out of its socket, held on only by a thin scrap of flesh.  ""Rick, did you get through?"" I gasped as the zombie raised my sword.  ""Yes,"" I heard him respond as the sword sliced into my gut.    Yes, this is the end. We'll never know what happened with Powell, Simmons, and Williams. Sorry!"

Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,Kal_Reegar,3,Fri Feb 27 22:57:24 2015 UTC,Thanks; fixed!
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,aquariumkeeper,11,Fri Feb 27 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"Great story! The enemies assuming the powers came from radiation is a nice touch, and even though Williams' power is already known, you're leading up to its reveal well."
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,mr_abomination,11,Sun Feb 8 20:05:32 2015 UTC,"HES EITHER A NECROMANCER OR HE TALKS TO THE DEAD!! called it. Write more please!!  Also as a side note, the guy being able to conjure stuff sems ridiculously overpowered. He can summon food, that's not too crazy, but now he can also summon fire and kill a whole bunch of people just that easy? And then summon backpacks? Why not just summon up some tanks, guns, armor, fuel, maybe some robots to help protect them? Imho it's just a bit too strong. Other people's thoughts?"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,CelticMara,22,Sun Feb 8 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"They can all do fire. I mention that they each have a specialty, but there are some things that all of them can do.  As for a limit to his power, it would probably be that he can't summon something complex. A bag, beer, and food are not too complicated; tanks and such with lots of moving parts would be different."
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,DaVinciStein,9,Sun Feb 8 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"what about guns? A simple pistol wouldn't be too hard i think and ammunition isn't complicated. Also, armor is pretty simple too, like military or police/riot armor. Not trying to nitpick or be rude, just a little constructive criticism!"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,47waffles,12,Sun Feb 8 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's limited to certain materials, like metal can't be summoned?  I'll have to think about it for future sections!"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,nordicthrust,14,Sun Feb 8 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's probably limited more by his knowledge base than his power. If I understand the prompt, he doesn't have his own magic, but rather access to a huge well of it. So he can summon backpacks, food, and fire becAuse he understands them. Say he was the engineer on the station, and I see no reason he shouldn't be able to summon a new station"
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,chiyeung,11,Sun Feb 8 21:22:54 2015 UTC,That makes sense; he has to be able to understand how to make it before he can summon it. Knowing how a backpack fits together is pretty easy; knowing how to make a tank is much different.
Luna_Lovewell,2uzh0z,fletchleanne,10,Sun Feb 8 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"Just a thought! Also, wouldn't they or at least the main character be phased after killing all those people? They're scientists, not soldiers, and most people, INCLUDING soldiers, have some problems after killing their first person, if not last problems at least immediate ones. This guy killed a whole group of people in the proven most painful way to die possible and shrugged it off like it was nothing."

Luna_Lovewell,2urtqo,dylanblock,2,Wed Feb 4 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"Along with an opportunity to make money based off viewer counts, you'd have a chance to branch out into anything you wanted with your writing, whether to categorize short stories and personal writing pieces separately or have an extensive About Me section you could reference professionally outside of the writing field.  You have much more control over a personal blog than you do a subreddit, say if you ever needed or wanted to expand into other genres, and branch your writing into fields more relevant to your own life/career. It's much more personal, and easier to maintain a loyal following (especially if you are serious about finishing your book).   Definitely consider it :) it can go a long way depending on how creative and time intensive you're willing to take it. Anyways, regardless of what you do, best wishes!"

Even some of the guards were loitering around B-wing, waiting for the kid to be brought in. Just to see what would happen.  The sirens buzzed and orange lights flashed as the main entrance motors whirred to life and the heavy metal door slid open with a groan. It was like a trigger for the prisoners; they clambered down from their bunks and ran over to the doors, a sea of orange jumpsuits poking through the gaps. Some of them clanged metal objects against the bars; others gripped them with their meaty fists and shook till even the heavy-duty hinges rattled. They gnashed their teeth and flexed their muscles as the kid marched down the aisle, flanked by guards in combat gear. They yelled at him, alternating strangely between cat-calls and physical threats.  The boy didn't seem to care in the slightest. He plodded along, looking into each cell like he was on a field trip to the zoo. Each prisoner was studied and cataloged by his cold, scientific gaze.  ""Is this supposed to intimidate me?"" he finally asked one of the guards as yet another prisoner threatened to break every bone in his body. ""I'm not an idiot. You all would never have let me into this place if there was even the slightest chance of me getting hurt by one of these thugs, unless you all like getting slapped with multi-million dollar lawsuits. So, why the whole dog and pony show?"" he gestured next to him, where an enormous, muscle-bound prisoner had stopped mid-flex as though a plug had been pulled somewhere and he'd lost power. The boy adjusted his glasses and kept walking without so much as a tiny wince. Some of the prisoners were shocked and confused by the lack of reaction, slinking away to their bunks like beaten puppies.   Eventually they all arrived at the barren cell. Walls of whitewashed brick, a gleaming steel toilet in the corner, and two plain, plastic, forest green mattresses on a rusty set of bunk beds. At the very top of the cell, a window the size of an envelope existed solely to let in light; this kid probably wasn't even tall enough to climb onto the top bunk. He stood in the doorway, surveying his surroundings with an expression of boredom and apathy. One of the guards tossed him a rough wool blanket an a set of linens thinner than toilet paper. ""You can make your own bed,"" they spat at him, clutching at their batons threateningly. He shrugged, still not showing the slightest bit of fear. The guards looked at each other, uncertain of what to do.   ""And what time is breakfast?"" he asked like he were speaking to a hotel desk clerk.   The head guard shoved the boy roughly into the cell, throwing him to the cold, concrete floor. His glasses skittered across the cell and came to a stop against the steel toilet. The sheets and the blanket spilled out of his arms. ""Breakfast is for inmates with good behavior. You don't qualify yet.""  He slammed the door shut with an echoing clang that set off the rest of the prisoners, then turned to march back to their posts.  ""HEY!"" the kid called out behind them. The head guard stopped and motioned for the rest to keep moving; they'd taken up enough time with this farce. He went back to the cell, where the kid's tiny face was stuck through a gap in the bars, making his glasses crooked. ""Can you do me a favor?"" the boy continued, lowering his voice till it was almost a whisper and the guard had to lean in close to hear it over the raucous shouts coming from around the cell block. The kid studied the guard's nametag closely then looked him straight in the eyes.  ""Matthews?"" he said, and the guard nodded in confirmation. ""Tell the other guards that I don't blame them. They'll be fine. As for you, Matthews, sleep well tonight."" The kid smiled for the first time that day and headed to the bunkbed to begin arranging the sheets.   Here is part 3!   And also, if you all are enjoying the story, you should subscribe to this subreddit!"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,radseam,298,Thu Jan 29 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"Matthews sat in the uncomfortable office chair of the guard station for B Wing. Dozens of screens in front of him flickered steadily with images of the prisoners in their cells. It was like looking through a bugs eye, showing a hundred different images at once. Most of the prisoners were sleeping. Some were pacing in their cells. Others were reading. The kid, though? He was sitting. Just sitting, staring at the plain, blank, white wall of his cell. He'd been doing this for hours. Not even moving. He was certainly still awake, because he was sitting upright and not even leaning against the wall. It was like he was watching the most engrossing TV show of his life and couldn't be bothered to even go to the bathroom.  ""I don't like it,"" Matthews told Owens, who had just come on duty about half an hour ago. Owens sighed and got up from his own seat and headed over to look over Matthew's shoulder. Together, they watched the boy for a minute or two. He was like a statue.   ""Maybe it's a problem with the video feed,"" Matthews speculated. ""Maybe it's looping or something.""  ""It's not a problem with the feed,"" Owens responded, pointing at the cell next to the kid's, where a prisoner had just turned off his light and gone to sleep. He looked down at the desk in front of Matthews, where the kid's open file was sitting in front of him. The statement from the parents, handwritten in the Warden's chicken scratch script, was the only document it contained. ""Just calm down and stop obsessing over this kid. He isn't in any danger.""  Matthews nodded in agreement, but couldn't pry his eyes away from the screen. The kid wasn't in any danger. The soft voice echoed through Matthew's mind, over and over again. Hundreds of other prisoners had threatened him over the years. Telling him they'd kill him. Kill his family. Rape them. Hell, a few of them had said they wanted to eat his family. Threats were nothing new. So why was this driving him so mad??  Owens went back to his seat and sipped at a steaming cup of coffee with a satisfied smack of his lips. He was humming to himself as he filled out the paperwork on the desk.   ""God, will you cut that out?"" Matthews snapped, slamming his hand on the desk. There was a chilling silence in the room as Owens stopped humming and stopped writing. Only the gentle, almost silent buzzing of the monitors filled the space between them. Matthews rubbed at his temples, slowly massaging them as he felt a headache start to form.  ""Maybe you need to take the rest of the night off,"" Owens said slowly. ""Marsh is on standby, I can call him and have him over here in just a second. You can go home and have a good night's sleep."" Matthews didn't respond. ""We'll take good care of the place,"" Owens reassured him. ""We'll keep a good eye on the kid.""  The kid, Matthews thought. ""Sleep well tonight"" was still echoing through his mind like a skipping record. No one else had heard it. There was no one to corroborate his story. Hell, nobody had probably even reported the fact that he'd gone back to talk to the kid for a second.  ""I'm going to do my rounds now,"" Matthews said tersely, not acknowledging Owens' concerns. ""I'll be back in a few minutes. Just keep an eye on the cameras for me.""  He stood quickly from his chair and wrenched open the door, causing the blinds to swing and clatter. He stormed out and slammed it shut before Owens could even respond. Clicking on his flashlight and getting out his baton, he entered B-Wing cautiously. His footsteps clicked softly on the metal walkway above the indoor rec area, an interior courtyard with some weights at the center of the three-story cell block.  The rounds were uneventful and quiet as he slowly made his way around, heading up to the third floor. Where the kid was being held. His feet thumped against the stairs in the same way he'd gone up for the past 10 years. The grey concrete walls seemed to close in around him, and he subconsciously picked up the pace for the second flight of steps, bursting out into the hallway. He huffed from the exertion and grasped the metal bar separating the walkway from the chasm leading down into the rec area. His heart pounded as he caught his breath, and he leaned over the railing.  Behind him, a firm set of massive hands gripped him like a vice around the legs. He swiveled his head frantically, but didn't see anyone as the hands lifted him into the air. The hands gave a mighty shove that sent him careening over the side. His eyes widened and his heart thumped as the concrete ground 3 floors below called out to him. He held onto the metal bar for dear life, but the invisible hands smashed down on his fingers like a sledgehammer. He couldn't help it; he let go.   The air whistled through his ears as he fell, but all he could hear was ""Sleep well tonight.""  Part 4!"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,mikamikira,242,Thu Jan 29 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"Warden Powell arrived back at the prison at 2:43 AM. The lights were all on, and the guards at the perimeter gate seemed particularly nervous. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes yet again and made his way to B Wing, where a cluster of guards had erected a sheet tent in the center of the courtyard rec area. Bleary-eyed prisoners on every level were clinging to their doors, trying to catch a glimpse of what was happening down below.   Powell took one peak behind the curtain and stepped back. Matthews' body, mostly in one piece, was sprawled awkwardly across the courtyard, head smashed in like a moldy melon. Dark blood pooled around him, seeping into the porous concrete slab. That stain is going to be a bitch to get out, Powell thought. His stomach tossed and turned like an angry sea storm, threatening to crawl back up his throat. God, what a disaster.  Owens was seated in the Warden's office when Powell arrived. He poured himself a drink from his secret stash behind the volumes of the penal code, and offered one to Owens as well. He slumped down into his chair, fighting revulsion and exhaustion simultaneously.  ""So, what happened?"" he asked finally.   ""I have the tapes here,"" Owens replied, holding up the flash drive in his hand. ""But there isn't much to tell. Everything was peaceful in the cells, and he was in his rounds. Looked like he took the stairs to fast, leaned on the railing to catch his breath, and then he must have gotten dizzy and tipped over or something.""  Powell held out his hands and waved his fingers, gesturing for Owens to give him the video. They watched it on the computer; it went down exactly as described.  ""Look at the weird way that his legs move, though,"" Owens said, slowing it down for a moment. ""Like he is just kind of floating off the ground. Not jumping, but not flailing around as if losing his balance.""  Powell watched it again. Weird, but it didn't really change anything.   ""Before he left on his rounds, sir, he was acting weird. Really weird; sick, maybe. I offered to have Marsh take his shift, but he didn't really listen. Snapped at me for humming, and he was watching that kid in the Scared Straight program. Watching him obsessively. He seemed to be worried that something was going to happen to the boy. He had your note out about the boy...""  Owens handed the scrap of paper to Powell, who read it over again. ""God, this is just what we need. A little kid in the prison just when a guard bites it...""  He looked at the note again, remembering the strange conversation with the boy's parents. All of the mysterious accidents that the school had accused the boy of orchestrating... the injuries, the deaths. But this couldn't be related...  ""Owens, did Matthews actually have any contact with the boy? Did they talk at all?""  ""No, sir."" Owens responded promptly. ""Not that I saw. That was his first set of rounds for the night, and otherwise he'd been in the office the whole time.""   Warden Powell nodded and breathed a gentle sigh of relief. See? Just a coincidence.   ""Although..."" Owens started. Powell's blood ran cold. ""Matthews was on duty when the boy was brought in to the cell block, wasn't he? Wouldn't have have been the one to escort the kid over to his cell?""  They double checked the logs, and sure enough, Matthew's name was on the key sign out sheet for Cell 318, where the boy was staying. A ball of lead formed in Powell's stomach, so heavy that it felt like it was dragging his whole body down. His heart was racing and his breathing was labored. An toxic cloud of dread filled the prison.  ""All right,"" Powell said finally. ""Bring the boy in here. We need to have a talk.""  Part 5"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,coloredpencils21,256,Thu Jan 29 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"""Son, did you speak to the guard that passed away? His name was Matthews?""  ""Jeremy,"" the kid replied. ""My name is Jeremy.""  ""Yes, Jeremy. Sorry,"" Powell responded. ""Did you speak to Matthews at all? Did he do anything to you?""  ""You already know that he did. You probably watched your videos and saw that he shoved me."" Powell and Owens hurriedly exchanged a look. No need to beat around the bush, then.  ""Jeremy, did you do something to him? Something that made him fall?""  Jeremy's rubber mask expression smiled innocently. Only his eyes retained a dangerous, burning hint of anger. ""I was in my cell the whole time when he fell. What are you suggesting?""  They stared at each other like two poker players determining who had the better hand. Jeremy had the confident smirk of a man with an ace in his sleeve. Powell was trying to hide the confusion and uncertainty of a man accusing a 12 year old of murdering a hardened prison guard using some inexplicable means that would throw him over a railing from 50 feet away behind a solidly locked door. It was clear who had the better hand.  ""Can I go back to my cell?"" Jeremy asked.   Warden Powell gave him one last look then turned back to computer. ""Owens, take the boy back to his cell for the evening. I am going to call his parents and arrange for them to pick him up in the morning.""  Owens stood from the chair and motioned toward the door. Jeremy marched out triumphantly while Owens escorted him meekly back. He wasn't a prisoner; hell, he wasn't even an adult! There was no evidence to accuse him of anything, and no way to hold him while an investigation was conducted. Best to just be rid of the problem and write Matthews' death off as a very unfortunate accident.  He picked up the black plastic receiver of the phone on his desk and punched in the number on the form that Jeremy's parents had left. A cheery female tone answered almost immediately.  ""We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.""    leaving my office now, but I'll work on Part 6 when I get home! Here's Part 6!"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,JIN615,219,Thu Jan 29 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"""I. DON'T. KNOW."" Powell repeated. ""I don't know! I've tried calling the parents. I looked them up online, and only found the same number. I sent Rodriguez and Stein over to their house to see if they were there, and it was just empty. Nobody home. I just don't know where else to look.""  ""Do you think they're... dead?"" asked Jones. The other guards in the room nodded in agreement. Given the kid's history, it wasn't that crazy of a guess. Maybe Jeremy'd driven their car off the side of the road as soon as they left the prison and they were in a ditch somewhere.  ""No,"" said the Warden automatically, but then he stopped and had to reconsider. ""No..."" he repeated, but this time uncertain. There was a burst of chatter amongst the guards.  ""We can't just leave him in the cell,"" Rodriguez piped up. ""He's not a convict. He's just a kid.""  There was a murmur of disagreement. Plenty of them were perfectly happy to let him rot in the dark until he wasn't their problem anymore.   ""And, what do you think he's going to do to us if we don't let him out? You think he's going to enjoy sitting in that dank cell and not do anything about it?""  The murmurs changed to agreement, and everyone looked to Powell for guidance. He leaned back in the chair and rubbed his foreheard, trying to think.   ""All right, all right."" He sat back up. ""Jones, Rodriguez, let him out into the yard. But he needs to be isolated from the other prisoners. Clear off court B and let the kid play some basketball or something."" The two guards selected didn't move from their positions, looking around nervously. ""Ok. Stein and Greene, go with them. Do not let anything happen to the kid!""    The door to the yard opened, and two guards in full riot gear moved out, clearing the prisoners away from the entrance. ""None of you say a word to him!"" they warned the prisoners. ""Not a word!"" Together, the guards herded the prisoners toward the baseball field and weight yards, away from the path to the basketball court.   Flanked by two guards, Jeremy marched out the door flanked by two more guards. He seemed slightly amused at their sheer terror and the efforts they went through to separate him from the prisoners. He was half-heartedly dribbling a basketball, with a clear lack of hand-eye coordination.  The prisoners jeered and called out to him again, completely ignoring the advice of the guards. They tried to quiet them down, but the inmates were all under the impression that they were still trying to scare the boy straight. They took pleasure in hurling out the most vile insults they could think of. They rushed Jeremy off to the basketball court as quickly as possible, practically dragging him by the shirt collar. He stumbled on the pacement, and his foot kicked the basketball straight across the field and into the crowd of prisoners. Everyone froze. Guards, prisoners, and Jeremy.   From the center of the mob, a convict emerged holding the orange basketball, turning it over and over in his hands with a grimace. The wide, sneering smile warped the large black swastika inked across his cheek.   ""This yours, you little faggot?""  Jeremy didn't respond. The guards rushed over to try to silence the prisoner and get the ball back, but the prisoners rallied around the neo-nazi and managed to hold them off. He held up the ball in one enormous hand and ran it roughly along the barbed-wire fence at the end of the yard until the ball deflated into a shapeless orange lump. The guards all eyed each other nervously, not sure how Jeremy would react.   ""What is your name,"" the kid's voice squeaked.   The enormous prisoner laughed. ""Bill,"" he shouted. ""Come look me up when you're in here for good!""  Jeremy only nodded and continued to the basketball court. ""Could you get me another ball?"" he asked the guards politely. ""Please?""    Jeremy was dribbling the ball and shooting at the hoop, not even getting close. He tried a layup, with a miserabe failure. The guards were too busy pacing the perimeter to notice how bad he was, but the prisoners in the yard were laughing their asses off.   Bill had taken his turn at the weights. Another member of his gang loaded up the bar as he flexed his muscles and rubbed dirt on his hands for grip.   He laid down on the bench and reached up, biceps bulging. Another white supremacist held his hands gently over the bar, ready to spot him. Bill heaved the weights into the air and slowly lowered it to his chest, breathing slowly and deliberately. He pumped it up and down slowly. ""10 more pounds,"" he told his buddies, who carefully slid them onto the ends.   He pushed the bar back up into the air... and it slipped. It rolled right out of his fingers and into his chest with a sickening crack. His arms flailed and his face started to turn red. It was resting directly on his windpipe, making his head look like a swollen bubble. His spotter reached down desperately, heaving at the bar and unable to even budge it or roll it to one side.  Other prisoners started to notice, running across the yard to either watch or help. Some maybe to gloat. The guards took notice too and tried to push their way into the mob to see what was happening and disperse the crowd. Only Jeremy seemed oblivious to everything, practicing his three point shots and not even coming close.   By the time the guards managed to get there, Bill's tongue was hanging limply out of his swollen, beet-red face. Rodriguez tried to take his pulse, and looked back at Jones grimly.  Across the yard in Court B, Jeremy cheered as he finally made a shot.  Now Part 7!"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,JIN615,265,Fri Jan 30 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"Owens and Jones ran to the basketball court while the prisoners were all distracted gawking at Bill's body. If anyone managed to put two and two together and connected Matthew's death and Bill's death to angering Jeremy, then they'd have a riot on their hands.   Jones grabbed him rougly by the shoulders and practically dragged him away; the basketball bounced off on its own into a corner, forgotten.   ""Let go!"" Jeremy protested, but the guards were too busy keeping an eye on the prison mob to notice. In the center, the other members of the white supremacist gang were shouting about something. A few other convicts in the back of the group had turned around and were starting to point and whisper. Sirens rang out from the guard tower, commanding the prisoners to get down on their knees and put their hands behind their head; only one or two complied. More of them turned and pointed as Jeremy and the two guards bolted down the path and back inside.   ""God, what are you, you freak??"" Jones burst out in anger as they rushed Jeremy up the stairs. They made it up a couple more steps before any of them really processed what he had said. Jones clapped a hand over his mouth like he could take the words back and swallow them. Owens stumbled violently, clamping a hand down on the railing just to stay upright. Jeremy stopped on the staircase and turned slowly to Jones looking like a snake eyeing its prey. His eyes were even narrow into little slits that didn't look the least bit intimidating. Or, wouldn't to someone who didn't know the power that this kid wielded.   ""Excuse me?"" he said slowly.  Two floors down, a door burst open and the raucous shouting of prisoners filled the open air in the center of the cell block, echoing up to the ceiling. A lot of it was unclear, but one of them definitely said ""the kid.""  ""We don't have time for this,"" Owens hissed. Jones nodded, but was too afraid to approach Jeremy.  ""Come on, Jeremy"" Jones said quietly. ""We need to get you back to safety.""  The kid glared for another second, then reluctantly stomped down the hall toward his cell. More and more prisoners were filing back into the cell block. Down below, guards were trying to restore some semblance of order.   Finally, Jones and Owens got Jeremy inside and slammed the door shut with a bang.  Jeremy leaned close to the bars and beckoned Jones forward, still steaming with anger.  ""You're going to pay for that,"" he told the panicked guard.  Jones backed away slowly, glancing about wildly for anything ready to leap out and kill him. Owens followed slowly, trying to calm him down. ""It's going to be OK. Just take it easy.""  It was too much. Jones pulled out his gun and leveled it at the shocked pre-teen behind the bars.   ""Don't do this,"" Owens cautioned.  It was too late. Jones squeezed the trigger, again and again. Three red holes appeard in the boy's shirt and slowly spread across his chest. The kid looked down in surprise, lifting one finger like he could plug them up or something. Then he collasped and toppled backwards.  Owens tore open the cell door and rushed to Jeremy's side. The kid hacked and coughed, sending a dribble of blood down each side of his mouth.  ""Oh god..."" the guard said. ""Oh man...""  ""You have no idea..."" the kid said faintly. ""What you've done... I was the only one that it ever listened to...""  The final chapter, Part 8!"
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,cowvin2,151,Fri Jan 30 03:34:41 2015 UTC,"""At least it's over now,"" Powell told Jones, handing him a glass of whiskey. ""It's over."" Jones slumped down on the couch in the corner of the Warden's office, holding it up with both hands like a child with a sippy cup. His eyes simply stared across the room at nothing in particular. The Warden poured another drink for himself, then one for Owens. It had been a long day.  ""What do we do?"" Owens said.  ""What can we do?"" Powell replied, lowering his voice so that Jones couldn't hear. Not that he was paying attention anyway. ""He shot a kid. Three times in the chest! And not just that: a kid who was locked in a jail cell. In front of a group of prisoners, who all saw it happen! How the fuck do we claim self-defense? How could we get out of that?""  ""We could explain what happened,"" Owens said weakly. ""With Matthews, and the prisoner...""  ""Explain what? That they both died due to accidents? There's a video of Matthews going over that railing completely on his own. And there were a hundred prisoners in the yard to confirm that Bill was lifting too much, he dropped the bar, and his spotter couldn't get it up in time. The kid wasn't even near him! He was over on the basketball court."" Powell took a swig of his drink and slowly massaged his forehead with his fingertips. ""We don't have any way around it. We have to give up Jones. Temporary insanity or something.""  Across the room, Jones dropped his glass. It fell to the floor with a loud crash and shattered into a dozen sparkling shards. A puddle of whiskey spread slowly over the smooth hardwood floors.  ""Jones,"" the Warden said apologetically, ""it's the only option! What else can we do?""  But Jones wasn't listening. He probably hadn't even heard the conversation. Instead, he was staring down at the broken glass on the floor. One particularly large diamond-shaped fragment twitched slightly, making a tiny rattling sound. Owens heard it, and turned to look with horror slowly spreading across his face. The shard of glass hovered into the air, moving slowly and uncertainly like a toddler taking its first steps. Light from the bright fluorescents overhead bounced onto the far wall as the glass turned toward Jones.   He tried to scramble off the couch; maybe making a break for the office door. As he lunged away, the glass flew up suddenly and caught him right in the throat. A bright red line appeared like a crimson ribbon before either Owens or Powell had a chance to cry out. Jones stopped mid-step and put his hands to his neck, unsure that anything had even happened. It took a second, then blood gushed out in a thick, dark waterfall, soaking his uniform. The piece of glass dropped back to the floor with a light tinkle that could barely be heard over Jones' gasps and thrashing. A thick pool of blood seeped outwards, eating up the entire floor.   A smudged line appeared in the pool like a child finger-painting, and slowly traced a deliberate pattern leaving streaks of visible wood.  NOW IT'S OVER"

Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,GRANDCHILDREN,5,Fri Jan 30 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"I wrote a bit more about that here.  It's main goal was to defend Jeremy, and after he was shot, it wanted to avenge his death. It has no reason to kill everyone else, but every reason to go after Jones."

Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,jacob8015,8,Fri Jan 30 03:57:06 2015 UTC,I've never seen it
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,fugitivesam,11,Fri Jan 30 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool concept, an extremely intelligent and very popular high school kid finds a notebook that has the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in it. So he takes it upon himself to make the world a better place by writing down all the names of the worst criminals in the world. The police of countries all over the world get suspicious when hundreds of criminals start simultaneously dying of heart attacks, so they call on the help of an anonymous detective...."
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,krutch1,6,Fri Jan 30 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"You should watch it, it's not quite the same but it has a similar feel to this story."
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,CVance1,5,Fri Jan 30 04:17:39 2015 UTC,It is very much a compliment.
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,Joseph_Hughman,5,Fri Jan 30 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend it. I got a similar vibe from reading your story. I kept saying to myself ""He's like the killer in death note, but without the notebook"". Most suspenseful Anime, or even TV show, I have ever seen. Only Death Note can make a guy casually eating from a packet of chips the most intense, dramatic and epic thing ever."
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,SkyWest1218,5,Fri Jan 30 06:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, because the kid seemed to need the names of his victims."
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,Lusifur,2,Fri Jan 30 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"The names were just a way to introduce the characters more at the relevant times. Before he pushed Jeremy, Matthews was just ""the head guard."" Naming him means the readers could more easily focus on him and remember who he was."

I was also reminded of Death Note, although the description of Matthews' death made me suspect either some form of shapeshifting, demonic attack, or some insane manipulative power (somehow, the possibility of the kid being some kind of Machiavellian supergenius was far creepier to me than the idea that he was a werewolf or necromancer). Definitely an awesome read!"

I didn't realize that was more than one part and now I need to know how the fuck this kid is doing it. My best guess is that he has a Death Note.
Luna_Lovewell,2u3469,jaczach,4,Fri Jan 30 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I want this to be supernatural or simply a semitone in the kid's voice that allows him to place post-hypnotic suggestions. Either way, it's such a rare thing to encounter a writer who you know will make anything enjoyable and gripping.  I've coached a lot of wonderful writers. I'm published myself.

As an avid reader my entire life, I can honestly say you have as much talent as some of my favourite authors and I am confused as to how someone hasn't discovered (for lack of a better word) you yet and published your works. I have pinned this thread onto my start screen on my phone and plan on revisiting it to catch up on the stories you have listed here that I have not read yet. Good luck with publishing and as I'm sure you can tell, pretty much every redditor, myself included, will be buying a copy of your books! Congrats on being so damn talented!"

Luna_Lovewell,2tz9dr,ThatDCguy69,3,Tue Mar 31 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it's helpful!   A subreddit is good for organizing one-off posts, but keeping multi-part stories together is a challenge, especially when written over a long period of time."
Luna_Lovewell,2tz9dr,ThatDCguy69,2,Tue Mar 31 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"I just got to ask, in the Harry Potter story with the Dragon House, did u end up finding an antagonist to continue the story? Since the lead character is female, i was thinking that the antagonist would be male! And since there's a history between dragons and Phoenix(es) maybe have the male linked to the phoenix or something"
Luna_Lovewell,2tz9dr,qwa_456,2,Tue Mar 31 21:24:11 2015 UTC,The antagonist is probably the main issue right now that keeps me from continuing the story. There are a bunch of different routes I could take with it but I don't know which one would turn out well. And I have a bunch of other writing projects that I am working on so I haven't taken the time to really sit down and sketch out how best to continue it.

I don't feel there is really any need for you to continue the story, as it is nice and concise, you have communicated an idea (a meme!) fantastically and made your point.   I am currently listening to 'X minus 1' which is old wireless plays, short stories are good.  Some of the plays are a tad hokey but the 'communicate' well.   My Grand Father, who I just read your story too, asked that I not mention the 'Galactic Barrier' on the next level and also to tell you not to worry about 'space blues'.  ps: he isn't really my Father, I just know him as Gran Unca Charlie."

I enjoy writing prompt responses and I'm just happy that you all seem to enjoy reading them. By accepting donations, I feel like I've taken on an obligation to put out good stories that I don't know if I'll be able to meet. I guess it just complicates things more.  But when I finish my book, I'd be thrilled if you wanted to buy a copy!"

Make sure to put up a link once your book is done. I've read a few of your prompts and for the entertainment you've given me the very least I can do is buy your book(knowing your writing though, I'm sure I'll get my moneys worth and then some).    There's nothing wrong with putting up a donation link on the subreddit. People aren't buying or paying for your future time, they're donating for the time you've already spent. If people read your stories and, however unlikely it may be, don't like them, they wont donate. I doubt anyone would think less of you for putting up a donation link, but if you think it'd feel like too much of an obligation then don't. All I'm saying is, people would donate for the entertainment you've already given them, not for the entertainment that they might get in the future."

Luna_Lovewell,2tf6kt,Luna_LoveWell,123,Fri Jan 23 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"We left from Liverpool later that week aboard the Destiny, which I found to be particularly fitting. Mom complained about it endlessly as we boarded, but there wasn't really any other option. The ocean was far too wide to cross on brooms, I was too young to apparate, we couldn't take baggage via the Floo Network, and Dad had always been uncomfortable with Portkeys for some reason. So ship it was.  Mom may have hated the Destiny, but I was having the time of my life! The swaying and rocking of the ship, the sound of a dozen sails overhead snapping taut as the wind billowed behind them, the creaking sounds of the wooden deck... it was amazing. I spent most of my time high on the mast, up in the crow's nest with the lookout waiting for any sign of America. I got to know the crew fairly well, and they told me all of their amazing stories. Battles with Krakens and Sirens; trading with Mermen and Undines; fighting through squalls and hurricanes and dodging icebergs. The life of a sailor sounded so action-packed!   Six days into our journey, I was perched waiting atop the highest mast. If Mom had seen me, she would have levitated me back down in an instant and chained me to one of the cannons below deck. Through the clouds ahead of me, something bright sparkled. A ling, thin line of metal poked up above the mist. A building! Bigger than any that I'd ever seen! From the crows nest, one of the crew shouted ""LAND HO!"" I scurried down the mast through the nets like a red-headed spider. Below me, the deck was changing. The grey-green wood was turning to cold steel. The cabin's yellowy glass windows and ornate wooden carvings were rising up, shifting into a plain metal cabin painted a dull white. The sails morphed into boring corrugated metal shipping containers as I raced across the deck. Mom and Dad were below deck; the hammocks had disappeared and everything had been replaced by boring little passenger rooms.   We changed into our muggle clothes and headed back outside, where the ship's transformation was complete and we looked just like any other cargo vessel. I watched in amazement as we passed by the shore of the city, with enormous glittering buildings reaching into the sky, higher than you could ever fly on a broom. James and Albus had talked about how large Hogwarts was, but it wouldn't even be a speck amongst all of these! I snapped picture after picture, trying to decide which one would make them most jealous. I'd heard of New York, but never realized that it was like this!  Finally, we arrived at the docks. Dad, having been born a muggle, knew how to get around. He stepped into the street and waved at someone; had he maybe recognized a friend? A bright yellow car swerved off the road immediately and stopped in front of Dad; the driver hopped out and began to put the luggage in the back. ""Do you know him?"" I asked Dad. ""Why did he stop for you?""  Dad laughed and tousled my hair a little. ""I always forget how little time you've spent out in the Muggle world! It's just a taxi, dear. We are going to pay him to take us to the hotel."" I nodded slowly, still not quite sure why Dad had waved at him, but I didn't want to ask a stupid question. ""Don't worry,"" he told me. ""You'll get the hang of it.""  We climbed into the backseat of the car; I was crammed in tight between my parents. The car smelled and the fake leather of the site was cracked and peeling. Dad handed the man a slip of paper with the hotel's address, and the car sped off. As we drove, I couldn't help lean over Mom's lap to stare out the window at the towering buildings and bright lights. So much activity! So many things to do and see! I couldn't wait to live in this city!  The car pulled to a stop and Dad handed the man a fist full of green paper. He piled our baggage on the sidewalk and sped off in a hurry without even a goodbye. A swarm of muggles advanced from either side, crowding around us as we gathered our belongings. ""We ready to go in?"" Dad said, gesturing forward. In front of us, a jet-black stone storefront loomed, dotted with brightly-colored flags flapping in the wind. Above the door, there was a sign with loopy gold letters: BLOOMINGDALES.  (Some stuff came up at work and I am a bit swamped at the moment but would like to continue this at some point)"
Luna_Lovewell,2tf6kt,dirtnsnow,81,Fri Jan 23 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"Mum and Dad ushered me through the crowded muggle store, past racks of bright clothes, strange-smelling potions, and all sorts of other items. There was so much to see! Everything was gleaming new and displayed under bright lights; I wanted to play with all of it! Mum always said that my fascination with muggles reminded her so much of Grandpa.   Somehow my parents managed to drag me through the first floor and up to some moving stairs that the muggles called an ""escalator."" It was bringing us to yet another floor of treasures, this time almost all muggle clothes. Dad maneuvered us through mobs of people holding enormous shopping bags and over to the shoe department. In one corner, a pair of ugly green boots the color of old asparagus sat on a high shelf gathering dust. Dad reached up and grabbed the pair, which looked large enough even for Uncle Hagrid. As he pulled them from the shelf, an identical pair popped into the same place. ""Put these on over your shoes,"" Dad told me. Mum laughed as I made a face at them, but I did as I was told.  The shoe display in front of me swam like hot air in a parking lot on a scorching summer day, revealing a hazy door. It was like peering through very thick mist that grew more and more clear as I got closer. ""Go on ahead,"" Mum said, pulling on her own pair. ""We're right behind you.""  I turned the knob of the door and stepped through to an enormous glass and steel palace, packed full of every type of shop I could ever think of. This building alone must have contained twice as many stores as all of Diagon Alley! At the far end, I recognized the Gringotts seal over a brick archway big enough to drive a train through. One floor above me, screams of childish delight emanated from a brightly lit doorway that could only have been a branch of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. There were stores for robes and gowns, potions and alchemical supplies, book stores, wand crafters... everything a wizard could ever need!  Mum and Dad came through the portal behind me, still wearing the asparagus green waders. We headed to a nearby bench, pulled them off, and tossed them into a nearby bin for re-use.   ""Where to first?"" Dad asked.  Mum chuckled, already knowing my answer. ""A wand!"" I told him."
Luna_Lovewell,2tf6kt,NewAccountXYZ,86,Mon Jan 26 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"""Cherry and Dragon Heartstrings, 11 inches,"" I repeated to myself as we walked out of the store. I turned it over and over in my hand, admiring how well the delicately carved grooves fit my small hand. It felt like the wood had simply grown from my fingers; a part of me. It was even warm to the touch, despite the cooling charms in the mall to ward off the muggy New York summer. Behind me, Mum and Dad were reminiscing about their own first trips to a wand maker named Olivander in Diagon Alley.  Next stop, robes. The bell above the door tinkled lightly as I stepped into a large shop, high up on the 4th floor of the mall. The windows were full of dancing mannequins wearing shimmering gold fabrics. Inside, the seamstresses were working in a frenzy, probably using some speed potion to get everything done in time. The needles and threads in their hands were a blur of movement as they charged through the line, fitting girl after girl in long robes of black with orange trim. Finally, my turn. I stepped up onto the small platform; the fabric unspooled itself with a wave of the witch's wand and began to wrap around me like a soft black snake. ""Oh, no! Sorry!"" Mom said, jumping up from her chair. ""Not Salem robes,"" she told the seamstress, who stared at Mum like she was mad. ""She'll be at the Brooklyn Academy.""  The seamstress looked back at me with the most peculiar expression. Part shock, part burning curiosity, part sympathy, and part fear. She turned back to Mum, as if asking if she was certain I was going to Brooklyn. With a shrug of the shoulders, the bolt of black fabric wound itself back up, and a trail of emerald green cloth drifted out of the back room. A few quick cuts and stitches later, and it had become a long cloak with silver lining. ""You look amazing, honey!"" Mum told me. The seamstress remained absolutely silent. We paid for the robes and walked back out into the brightly lit mall.  ""What was that all about?"" I asked. ""Why did she seem so shocked when you said I was going to the Brooklyn Academy?""  ""It's nothing,"" said Mum. ""They just haven't really had a large class of students for some years now. Nothing to worry about! Oh, look! An ice cream parlor! What flavor are you going to have?""   I didn't press the topic, and we went about our shopping after a tasty treat. We met up with Father at the potion shop, buying my first cauldron and a beginner's set of ingredients. Next, we headed to the book store and picked up all of my texts for first year classes. As the sun began to set through the skylights overhead, Dad rejoined us holding a delicate gold cage and a new owl. ""First day of school tradition,"" he told me.  We headed out of the shopping center to our hotel, tired and loaded with bags of school supplies. But I couldn't get that seamstress's look out of my mind."
Luna_Lovewell,2tf6kt,Bilbobaggins212,77,Mon Jan 26 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"We left early the next morning; I was supposed to arrive at the Academy at 8 AM sharp. We took the muggle train (the ""Subway) into town. It was filthy and small and crowded and dirty; definitely the worst part of the city so far. I had expected a lot of strange looks for carrying an owl through the train station, but as I would soon learn, I wasn't even close to the oddest passenger in the train. Even Dad was staring around with an expression that said ""I don't remember muggle transportation being so gross.""  We arrived at the main hub for trains, called ""Grand Central Station."" It had tall, smooth stone walls and beautiful arched ceilings. Enormous windows let bright sunlight filter through just as it started to peak above the tallest city buildings. My new shoes squeaked softly on the polished floors underfoot. Mum and Dad followed closely behind, carrying armfuls of luggage. Muggles ran to and fro desperately, eyes on their newspapers and phones to avoid any contact with anyone else.   ""Where to now, Dad?""   He gestured over to the middle of the terminal, where a circular desk full of computers waited. Dad walked over, and the computer prompted him to type in our destination. He entered ""Brooklyn Academy of Sorcery and Enchanting,"" just as the hotel concierge had told us to.   The computer beeped for a moment, then turned off with a flash of green light. Just as I was about to ask Dad if it was working, the enormous red, white, and blue flag hanging above us rustled. Like it would in a strong breeze... except we were completely in doors. The flag whooshed again, blowing around wildly, and began to lower itself. The muggles streaming through doors on every side didn't seem to notice; too focused on whatever it was they held in their hands. The soft fabric of the flag fell draped over us like a cocoon. Dad put a hand on my shoulder reassuringly, but I wasn't scared. Quite the contrary; I always loved discovering the creative entrances for magical places! The white part of the flag's fabric was just translucent enough that I could see the station around me as it contracted until the stripes were tight against us. I saw the high, light-filled windows slowly falling away as we rose up and up, spirited to the top of the building by the flag.  It opened up like a flower, revealing a train platform at the very top of the building. The ground under my feet was completely clear, showing the muggles below like ants as they rushed to their own trains. A few other students nearby in green robes were loading their bags onto the train and saying goodbye to their families. They all looked to be about the same age as me. Every one of them seemed to have American accents, and I was suddenly self-conscious of how I spoke.  Mum and Dad helped me with my bags, then swept me off my feet into a bear hug. Dad pressed me up against his scratchy beard and squeezed me tight. Just as he let go, Mom took me in her arms and hugged even tighter. ""If you need anything,"" she said, ""Just let me know, OK? You can call, or send an owl, or anything.""  She set me down, and Dad knelt in front of me. ""And honey, if you're ever in any danger, just keep calm and try to get to safety, OK? We'll be there as soon as we can, so you just need to stay alive. Don't try and fight something. And there's no shame in hiding.""  ""What do you mean?"" I asked, but I was interrupted by the shrill whistle blowing down the platform. The other students all left their families and headed inside, and the doors gave a warning chime that they'd soon be closing.  ""Just remember: be careful"" Dad said before ushering me inside. The subway train doors closed with a whoosh, and we were off to school."
Luna_Lovewell,2tf6kt,stealthhuckster,100,Mon Jan 26 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"The train was quiet. I wasn't really expecting that. James and Albus always talked about the Hogwarts Express like it was a zoo, with students running and jumping all over the place, reconnecting after a long summer apart and just happy to be on their way back. But this train was more like a graveyard.   In my compartment, there was only one other student: a tall and skinny brown-haired girl, fidgeting nervously. We sat across from each other in awkward silence, each really unsure of how to break the ice and strike up a conversation. Dad told me that he and Uncle Ron started talking over chocolate frog cards, but I suspected that this train didn't even have a food trolley.   ""Err, excited for the school year to start?"" I said finally. Quite a boring topic of conversation, but at least it was something.   ""Oh, very!"" she said. ""My brothers have been driving me crazy all summer talking about how great their school is!""  ""Me too!"" I told her. ""We're from England, so they go to Hogwarts, and it's all they can ever talk about!""  ""Hogwarts..."" she said faintly. ""Yes, I think I've heard about that. Wasn't there some violent evil wizard that came from there about twenty years ago?""  ""Voldemort,"" I told her matter-of-factly, but withheld talking about Dad's identity and role in that whole conflict. Maybe once we got to know each other.  ""Right. I remember hearing about it because he attacked the school and some people died. My brother Reggie keeps saying that that's what's probably what happened at Brooklyn too. But I think he's just trying to scare me.""  ""What do you mean, 'Happened at Brooklyn?'"" I asked.   She cocked her head to the side and bit her lower lip.  ""Well, the disappearances and deaths, you know?""  I shook my head; a few strands of red hair broke loose and drifted over my cheek. ""No, I don't know. What deaths?""  She furrowed her brow and looked at me suspiciously. ""Maybe it wasn't really covered very much in England.""  She took out a book from her rucksack and handed it to me. It was titled ""The Brooklyn Academy Mystery.""   ""It's all about what happened at the school 15 years ago. Every one of the students and faculty died one night. Some of them were just out in the halls, dead. And some of the bodies were never even found. And even now, nobody knows who did it or why. That's why the Academy was closed for so long, and why they're only just now starting to let students back in.""  Dad's words on the train platform echoed through my mind: Be careful. Mum and Dad had always been in danger at school, and Dad had never even finished his final year because he was being hunted by Voldemort. And now they were sending me off to the same fate! A life of constant adventure and heroism!  My first thought was: Albus and James are going to be SO jealous!    The end! The story of Lily Luna Potter's adventures at the Brooklyn Academy of Sorcery and Enchantment will have to wait for another day!"

I did see this prompt when it was coming up, but I didn't really have much to add! I thought that this response about the animals' injuries corresponding to sin was a great take on it, and what I probably would have done too. And I generally don't write a response to a prompt that I feel has already been answered the same way I would have. That just makes it repetitive, and I'm not adding something new to the post. Coming up with some original way to respond to the prompt is probably the hardest thing about using /r/writingprompts, but I enjoy the challenge.  Thank you for thinking that I'd have a good answer for this, and let me know if you see any other prompts you think I would like!"

Luna_Lovewell,2rr36q,Luna_LoveWell,114,Thu Jan 8 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"""I do not think... that we should trust this instrument,"" Skinbark told the Entmoot. There were a few hours of murmuring while the others pondered his contribution. The breeze blew through the clearing and rustled everyone's leaves as if wanting to voice its own concerns. The moon above was obscured by clouds, darkening the glade where the Ents had gathered.  ""I agree,"" Beechbone responded as the sun began to peek over the hills. ""The message is written in the Black Tongue of Mordor. And the Orcs have never been friends to the forests. They come always with saws and axes, smoke and fire. How can we trust this ring to find the wives if it was made by such creatures?"" There was a hum of agreement from the assembly; the savagery of the Orcs was a growing problem.   Treebeard did not wait to consider his response. Had these meetings always been so slow?! ""What do we have to lose? We fade from the world more and more each year! Leaflock does not even wake for the Entmoot anymore, and has become rooted in his field. If we do not find the wives soon, the trees will have no longer have any shepherds. The ring may have come from foul creatures, but it may still be used for good! Do not the metal tools of hoes and plows give rise to verdant fields?""  The others looked back at him with wide eyes, shocked either by his message, or the speed with which it was delivered. Treebeard kept his rough hands clasped around the ring, shielding it from the sight of the others.  The melodious song of morning birds was just beginning to fill the air as Quickbeam spoke, after only an hour of thought. ""Treebeard has a point,"" he said, stroking his mossy beard. ""We have few options left, and our numbers dwindle by the season. We are no flexible Entings; I feel my own bark becoming hard and my roots yearning to settle in a sunny pasture. If we do not complete our search now, I fear we never will. I fear I will never see Damproot again."" There was a murmur of agreement and lament as each of them remembered their own missing wife. Treebeard could feel the power of the ring in his fist, singing and pulsing, urging the Ents to follow.   ""Perhaps you are right,"" Beechbone conceded around mid-day. ""I do not like it, but there are few options left.""  ""But we know nothing about it,"" argued Skinbark as the setting sun washed over his face. ""Before using it, perhaps we should consult with the humans or elves about its properties?""  ""NO!"" said Treebeard emphatically, thinking of the half-man who had tried to burn him as he studied it. The others would try to take it as well! The birds in the clearing were silenced by his rumbling shout, and the other Ents studied him closely. Never had an Ent had such an outburst at the Entmoot. They stared at him in silence.   ""No,"" Treebeard continued. ""This is a powerful object. The humans and the elves would take it for themselves, just as they cut down our trees for their own purposes. They would not use the ring wisely; it would become just another pawn for their wars. And we would lose the chance to find the Wives.""  Quickbeam nodded slowly, satisfied by his answer but still surprised at Treebeard's sudden aggressiveness.  ""So, it is settled,"" Treebeard said without taking a vote. ""We shall take the ring and find the wives."" Moonlight filtered among the trees and the stars twinkled through holes in the canopy.   ""I cannot agree,"" Skinbark said finally. ""I wish you the best in your search, but I fear using the tools of Mordor shall only lead to a quicker end for us all.""  Treebeard stared at him with smoldering contempt, then stomped away from the clearing, still clutching the ring. Skinbark remained seated and watched the others follow one by one until they disappeared into the forest.   ""I shall bring this issue to Saruman, regardless of Treebeard's opinion,"" Skinbark resolved finally. ""He has always given me wise counsel, and he is a man of great learning. He will know what to do with this ring.""    I'll try and write a bit more later today if you like it! If you're not already, don't forget to subscribe to this subreddit!"
Luna_Lovewell,2rr36q,Monkey6775,18,Thu Jan 8 17:35:24 2015 UTC,In Luna we trust
Luna_Lovewell,2rr36q,Memphians,29,Thu Jan 8 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"Saruman climbed the staircase to the gatehouse slowly, leaning on his staff at every step. The crisp autumn wind blew through his long white hair as he came to the top and faced the forest. The trees were excited; Saruman could feel their energy. The branches and leaves bobbed in the wind, but it was more than that. They were excited by the visit from Skinbark.  Saruman came face to face with the Ent, who had been waiting patiently while Saruman traveled from Orthanc to the gatehouse.   ""I apologize for the delay,"" he started. ""If I had known that you were coming this afternoon, I would have met you here.""  Skinbark studied Saruman like he did not understand. ""Delay?""  ""Never mind,"" Saruman smiled. Ents never apologized for being too slow; they were only offended by excessive hastiness. ""How can I help you, my friend?""  Skinbark rumbled unhappily and leaned against the massive stone wall as he considered his words carefully. Saruman, knowing the predilection of the Ents for slow conversations, had wisely brought a book with him. ""An item has to come to the forest,"" Skinbark said finally. Saruman marked his page carefully and set it aside, listening intently. ""A strange item, made by Orcs. It is a piece of great power, to be sure. My companions are convinced that it can be used to find the missing Entwives.""  ""An item of power, made by the Orcs?"" Saruman asked. ""How strange; they are not known for their craftsmanship. They can barely work steel, much less create an enchanted object. What can you tell me about it?""  Skinbark pondered while the stars rose. Saruman had servants bring a meal and some oil lamps (the Ents were no fans of wood fires) so that he could continue his studies.   ""I have not seen the item myself,"" Skinbark confessed. ""Treebeard was very cautious with it, and I figured it would be best to wait to ask if I could see it. But a powerful energy filled the Entmoot. Like an alluring song, calling out to me. It has affected Treebeard already. He is acting more like a Man than an Ent. He is... suspicious, and rash. And he uses his words to persuade with emotion and urgency, not logic and reason. That is not the way of the Ents. This Orcish ring has changed him.""  Saruman's pen fell to the floor with a clatter, and his pot of ink spilled across the smooth marble flagstones.  ""Ring, you said?"" Skinbark nodded, sending yellowish leaves fluttering to the ground.   ""A golden ring? How do you know it was forged by Orcs? What features did it have?""  Skinbark cocked his head to the side, deep in thought. The moon passed overhead while Saruman gritted his teeth impatiently. He paced the length of the gate's rampart while Skinbark thought some more. Had it not been for the Ent's constant, thoughtful beard stroking, Saruman would have assumed that he'd fallen asleep.  ""As I said,"" Skinbark said at last, ""I did not see the ring. Treebeard told the Entmoot that he had been given the ring by a traveler as thanks for his assistance through the forest. He told us that it was gold, and that he had dropped it into a fire by mistake and had seen an inscription on the ring that said it could be used to find the Entwives. The writing was Tengwar, the language of Mordor.""  ""Skinbark, my friend, this is very urgent. Where is Treebeard now? Where has he taken the ring?""  Skinbark looked down on Saruman and considered his words for an hour or so. Ents do not understand the meaning of ""urgent.""   ""They have left the forest,"" he said finally. ""North, I believe. To search for the Entwives.""  Saruman bowed and excused himself. ""Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Skinbark. You were right to come to me; that ring is dangerous, and will lead your Ent companions to their doom. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to go contact some of my companions and prepare for a journey.""  He scampered down the gatehouse steps quickly and ran back to Orthanc, robes flailing in the wind behind him. Skinbark watched him hurry off with pity. These men only care for their treasures, he thought as he retreated back into the safety of the forest and the companionship of the trees."
Luna_Lovewell,2rr36q,Indie_uk,4,Mon Mar 2 17:21:39 2015 UTC,Treebeard looked down on Saruman and considered   Skinbark I think.  Cool stories!  Thanks for following up on it.

Luna_Lovewell,2rr36q,Lazy_Rebel,10,Mon Mar 2 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"Pre-corruption.  I didn't make it particularly clear, but Part 1 starts with Treebeard encountering Smeagol when he first gets the ring. Hasn't turned into Gollum yet. So this is all about 100 years before the Hobbit starts."

Nope. Just straight up feels. Made from concentrate, 100% all natural feels."
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,Luna_LoveWell,101,Tue Jan 6 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"They invited me into the small section of their main street that they'd managed to wall up using some vans and trucks from around town, filled with concrete. It was a crude barrier, but solid at least. The gate, however, wouldn't have withstood a charge from a good-sized dog, much less a horde of undead. God, I'm surprised they made it this long, I thought to myself as we took a seat at a picnic table in the center of the compound. I brought in some of the cans from my truck, and the men had opened them up and devoured the food without even cooking it. They were in worse shape than I thought.  ""I'm Alan,"" the man who'd bargained with me said, holding out a rough hand to shake. His hair and beard were overgrown, out of control. Apparently the town barber hadn't made it through the past few months of chaos. I saw him recoil slightly as I touched his hand with my icy skin.   ""Yeah, you'll have a lot of those moments in the next few weeks. Wait till we meet in front of a mirror."" I said with a laugh. Alan joined in uneasily.  ""So... a Vampire..."" he said, not quite sure how to broach the topic.  ""Yes,"" I said, not quite sure how to explain everything.   ""You're not going to like... drain us in our sleep or something, are you?""  I smiled, slowly sliding my fangs down for dramatic effect. His eyes widened, and I saw his hand itch back down toward the holster along his belt. But I retracted them and laughed again.  ""No, of course not. I kill you all and drink your blood... and then what? Move on to another fortification and try to do the same to them? What's the benefit in that for me? I could do that kind of thing when there were 7 billion of you, but now the food sources for us are few and far between. It's like I already told you: a partnership works so much better for both of us.""  ""Partnership?"" he repeated. ""Sounds more like you're keeping us as cattle, all penned up here away from the other predators.""  I gave him a good, hard look. For a person eating my can of beans, he didn't seem particularly friendly or grateful.   ""Cattle are killed for their meat,"" I explained finally. ""As I just said, I have no desire to kill you. I've brought food for you, and I'll continue to do so."" I gestured around at the men feasting on my supplies. ""All I ask is that you help me out by doing the same thing. The only difference is that I like a very specialized type of food.""   He nodded slowly and took his hands back off the gun. Shooting me wouldn't kill me, but it was certainly annoying.   ""All right, then,"" he answered, rolling up his sleeve. ""Let's do this. Stick me.""   I got out the needle and swabbed him down with alcohol; can't have my food source getting infected, can I? The blood trickled in a bright stream of red down into the bag. My fangs slid down in anticipation, and my mouth watered. I tried not to show how hungry I was. When we we finished, I bandaged Alan back up and snatched the bag. ""You probably don't want to see this,"" I told him, dying to sink my fangs into the pouch."
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,Ya_like_dags,112,Tue Jan 6 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"I've been a citizen of Garret Falls for about six weeks now. Well, that might not be the right word. Alan had offered me a home inside the walls, but I told him that I'd prefer to find my own place. So maybe I'm more of a partner with Garret Falls than an actual citizen. It's for the best, anyway. Us vampires have a lot of trust issues, particularly when it comes to humans. Alan certainly understood how beneficial this deal was for both of us, but I could tell that most of the other people in town were revolted by the idea of me drinking their blood. Some had even refused to participate in donating... until Alan told them that they wouldn't get any of the food or other supplies that I gathered. But to some of them, I was still just one step above one of the zombies.   I'd found a nice cabin about a mile down the highway. It was secluded, covered by thick boughs of shady pines that thoroughly blocked the sun during the day. I'd blacked out all windows with curtains and paint, and then dug through the basement until I had established a cozy little nest. For the outside, I set up a fence with alarms, and filled the interior of the grounds with a few pet zombies. This would keep out any curious people, townsfolk or otherwise. And just for safety, I added a few more traps inside the house. Like I said, vampires aren't particularly trusting of humans.  On a normal night, I'd drive over to the settlement after sundown, where I would receive a juicy bag full of bright red dinner and a list of supplies that they'd want. Construction materials, food, medicine, the works. Over time, we'd gotten more and more specialized: books, fertilizers, generators, etc. They weren't just surviving; they were rebuilding. I'd drive down the highway into the town center, blaring sirens and lights to attract as many undead as possible, then gather them up into one spot; I'd taken a liking to using the local high school's stadium. From there, I'd swing through with a sword, decapitating as fast as I could. It generally only took an hour or so, but the football field was starting to fill up; I'd have to pick a new spot soon. After that, I'd search through stores for the goods, and be back around 4 or 5. No problem.   The town had already grown since I'd been helping out, and word was quickly getting around. We'd even started trading with other settlements; they'd rigged a special vehicle for me (a hearse, fittingly) with blacked out windows so that I could travel with them. We'd returned not just with food and oil, but with six new families eager to join the settlement. Of course, they had questions when they saw the hearse, but they accepted me soon enough once Alan told them that they either lived with me or went out and fended for themselves.  Alan and I had grown close over the past month and a half. He had been skeptical at first, but he took a risk letting me in that night, and he stayed the course. He was a great leader for the town, too. Pragmatic, smart, and careful. His initial unfriendliness had just been protective suspicion; as soon as he was assured that I had no ill intentions and would be useful to his people, he was nothing but warm and friendly, despite my... condition. And he made sure that I got my blood every time, even if he had to pitch in himself. I truly relied on him as a go-between me and the rest of the community. He greeted me every night, never taking a rest day, with detailed orders and lists for my run.  Which is why I was surprised when I showed up at the gate one evening, only to find it empty. No blood, no orders, and no Alan."
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,ghostwhat,101,Tue Jan 6 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"The gate opened silently. This was one of the first things that I'd insisted they fix when I started running for supplies. I had an interest in keeping the town safe, too. Everyone was normally busy around now, preparing for dinner and checking for any breaches of the walls. The night's approach used to be their greatest fear, but now the town felt safest then knowing that I was out patrolling the woods and luring the undead away. Now, they spent the bright, sunny days huddled inside while I slept in my nest.   The first thing I noticed was the corpse of Sam Connor, right outside the gate, with an arrow through his neck. Plastic, thank god. Any sign of wood arrows and I'd run for the hills. His body was spread-eagle in front of the entrance, like he'd just fallen off of the platform over the gate. Behind him, I noticed more bodies, riddled with bullet holes and more arrows. Such a waste of perfectly good blood...   The smell of death pervaded the air, covering the entire town. But there were still some living nearby; I could sense it. I ducked into the shadows and made my way to the central hall, where everyone would normally be having dinner. It used to be a church, but they took down all of the crucifixes after I joined the town so that I could come in if I wanted to. Most of the people in the town had no appetite for a religion that espoused the values of a man who rose from the dead anyway.   As I suspected, the lights were shining through the stained-glass windows out front, ironically depicting the raising of Lazarus. Whoever was left from the town must still be inside. I snuck closer to the building, over more bodies that had fallen as they tried to rush inside the front door. The scent of their blood pooling in the grass caused my fangs to slide out, but dead man's blood was useless to me.  Inside, voices. Strange men with beards and leather jackets. They looked like one of those biker gangs that used to roam around the country back before everything fell apart. I moved around to a broken side window for a better look. They were laughing and shouting as they dug through piles of canned good and other supplies; supplies that I had gotten for Alan. Heaps of clothes and limbs, no longer recognizable as people, littered the hardwood floor with blood seeping out in thick dark puddles.   At the end of the room, where the altar used to be, sat Alan. He was bruised and bloodied and dirty, but there was a rag tied over his mouth, his hands seemed to be tied behind his chair, and he was sitting up. Which meant he was at least alive.   You fuckers have no idea what you've just started, I thought as I headed back to my truck for supplies.     Part 5 is on its way!"
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,CVance1,96,Tue Jan 6 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"I kicked open the door like a clap of thunder that echoed through the high ceilings of the church. The strangers inside jumped up from their seats and dove for the guns that were strewn along the table. Their looks of shock and fear turned to laughter and amazement as I stomped through the entry way, armed with only a set of pink towels.   ""What the fuck is this?"" said the largest, fattest one holding an AR-15 and eating one of the Blo-pops that I'd brought back for the settlement's children about a week back. ""I don't know who the fuck you think you are, buddy, but you're lucky that I'm in a good mood. You get the fuck out of here right now, and maybe I won't shoot you in the face.""  I ignored him, advancing across the room purposefully, stepping over my fallen comrades and leaving wet, bloody footprints across the tile.   ""Your choice,"" he said, shifting the lollipop to the other cheek. ""Blow 'im away!"" he called out.   They started firing just when I reached the first of them and wrapped the towel around his face. I was wearing a bulletproof vest, but the impacts were still annoying. I reached up and held one of the towels under his nose; his eyes widened while he pulled the trigger again and again. The horror grew as he realized it wasn't affecting me and I managed to tie the rag in a knot around his face. He dropped to the floor, unconscious.   I turned and walked to the next of them as the bullets chewed apart the wall behind me. I could feel the skin on my face peel under the force of the impacting buckshot, but it would grow back momentarily. I reached the second man and tied the rag about his head until he too dropped to the floor.   ""What the fuck, man!"" said the third guy as he tried to hastily reload his shotgun and ended spilling shells across the floor. ""What are you?"" I only smiled as I pulled out another rag. He dropped the gun and tried to vault over the table, but I snagged him by the collar and dropped him to the floor. He must have had an ounce of intelligence, because he tried holding his breath so that the chloroform wouldn't affect him. His cohorts kept firing anyway; what excellent friends they were. I had to shield him with my own body until he lost consciousness.   ""This is too much for me, man,"" one of them yelled as he dropped his gun and scurried for the door. I took out a gun from my pocket and shot him in the leg. Then again, just for good measure. He dropped to the floor, crying in pain; I could deal with him later. I moved on to one of the final three gunmen who were still pumping bullets out of their gun. Apparently they were slow learners.     Finally, I had sedated all of them except for the last one: the fattie with the blo-pop.   ""What are you?"" he said, sobbing as I advanced with the final towel. It must have been a terrifying sight as the skin on my face began covering up the bullet wounds. ""What the fuck is going on?""  ""I'm a vampire,"" I told him with a carefree tone. As if he should have figured it out already. I wrapped the rag around his blubbery lips and cheeks, directly under his nose. ""And I could have just killed you all if I wanted to. But I didn't...""  His eyes rolled, and he dropped to the floor. I draped the rag over his ugly face and whispered in his ear: ""I'm saving you."""
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,Xenomemphate,123,Wed Jan 7 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"The fat guy regained consciousness and began struggling against his bonds just as I was finishing stitching up Alan's eyebrow. I glanced over to the prisoner and said ""I'd better go take care of that,"" as Alan lightly brushed a finger of his puffy lips and bruised cheeks. He nodded, wincing in pain even from moving his head slightly. They'd sure done a number on him.  I crossed the room, where my fat prisoner was tied to a chair. I pulled the blindfold off of his eyes; he looked up at me with muddy confusion that quickly gave way to unbridled fear. Maybe it was the sight of me, or maybe it was the sight of his six colleagues strung up by their ankles from the rafters of the church ceiling. Muffled shouts and cries came from his gagged mouth, but that just made me smile. I walked over to one of the fat guy's friends and gave him a tiny push, causing the rope to creak a bit as he swung back and forth.   ""What do you think?"" I said, gesturing at them like I was trying to sell him a new sportcoat. The muffled cries stopped.   ""You thought I was joking, didn't you? When I said I was a vampire?"" He couldn't answer of course, but fear flooded his eyes and he began to cry. ""No, that's the real deal. And your friends here are going to make quite the meal for me."" I pointed at the thick tubes full of red blood that extended from their wrists and emptied into some plastic jars I'd found. ""They've been up for about 4 minutes,"" I told him, giving another one of the bodies a slight shove for emphasis. ""Gauging by the amount collected already, they'll never wake up.""  ""You remember my friend Alan?"" I said, walking back behind the chair and pointing across the room. Alan tried to wave a bandanged hand that had been pierced by an arrow, but winced again. Gotta find him some stronger painkillers, I thought to myself. ""You really roughed Alan up, and that's just a shame. Because he's such a good person. Now, normally he'd be willing to give me some blood to feed. He's done it before. But you did so much damage that I don't think he can spare it.""  I traced a finger across the veins in his fat arm. ""So, it will have to be you. I am going to bleed you dry while you watch your friends here pack me a lunch."" He struggled and moaned as I sank my fangs into his neck, savoring the taste. I'd been drinking from a bag for so long that I'd forgotten the satisfying taste of it fresh from the source. So warm and sweet....  I finished my meal and packed the leftovers into a cooler, then gathered some supplies for Alan and helped him into my hearse. We had enough supplies to last us for weeks; plenty of time to find a new home.  At the county line, Alan turned to me, fighting through the pain. ""Thank you for coming back for me,"" he said before dozing off.    That concludes this story. But, /u/SneakyBaconator generously offered to pay me to write more in this universe. I am so flattered by the offer that I am going to do it for free!! So, just subscribe to the subreddit if you'd like to see another adventure of Alan and his unnamed Vampire buddy.

Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,bornforthedark,8,Tue Jan 6 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"I've started writing a book now but I won't let anyone I know read it.   You, first off, are insane. I respect your decision though. :P  Secondly, if it's the one about Caius, do you know what you'll call it?"
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,wearingaredjacket,9,Tue Jan 6 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"I submitted a post here about the title. I really liked ""Rex Electi."" It's short and simple, and in only two words has an interesting contrast, because people don't think of kings as elected. Plus, it signals that the book relates to Rome somehow, and ""Rex"" and ""Electi"" are both generally recognizeable enough that it wouldn't throw off potential readers who would pick up a book with a Latin title and think ""Wonder what the hell this is about?"" and put it back down."
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,FurnitureCyborg,8,Tue Jan 6 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"I like it, although maybe to further encourage new readers it could be something like Rex Electi: The Chosen King or something (rough mockup). Do as you wish.  That was just a really quick draft, but if you ever need minimalist graphic design or something, feel free to hit me up!  edit: maybe ""Rex Electi: Sons of Rome"" is a better title. I don't know."
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,Hyenabreeder,4,Tue Jan 6 22:16:56 2015 UTC,I have been thinking of some ideas for a minimalist cover for it and I will definitely send you a message about it sometime if you really mean it.
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,fastinguy11,2,Tue Jan 6 23:22:40 2015 UTC,Of course - I'd be honoured!
Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,xc0z,2,Wed Jan 7 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"Oh man that is so good! and a good suggestion on ""The Chosen King"" or some additional bit like that."

Luna_Lovewell,2rj4ks,SmellinBenj,3,Tue Jan 6 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"Part 5? Also you are insanely talented, and you should most definitely continue on to a writing career. Good luck with your book!!!"

Luna_Lovewell,2rja17,simanthropy,2,Tue Jan 6 18:49:42 2015 UTC,I think the boat has sailed to fix the original trilogy.
Luna_Lovewell,2rja17,simanthropy,3,Tue Jan 6 18:51:04 2015 UTC,I more meant that we could at least be guaranteed a decent episode 8...

Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,ThothTheScribe,3,Thu Jan 8 21:42:41 2015 UTC,Because I didn't see the post until a few days later.

Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,juicy_n_seedless,9,Sun Jan 4 06:30:48 2015 UTC,whats a Unidan?
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,jaquefroid,16,Mon Jan 5 02:07:43 2015 UTC,Not sure if serious or making a joke...  I'll tell you anyways. He was a very well known redditor and he got into an argument about Jackdaws and it was discovered that he was using alt accounts to upvote himself. He was then shadowbanned from reddit (I think?) by the admins so no one can see anything he says or posts.
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,Clutz35,15,Sun Jan 4 08:44:28 2015 UTC,"wasn't a joke, thanks for the info."
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,jaquefroid,7,Sun Jan 4 09:30:22 2015 UTC,"No worries, you can never be too sure on the internet. Especially on reddit where I thought he was known by all."

Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,Clutz35,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:07:46 2015 UTC,Not sure if serious...  I like how Redditors think we all participate in this Redditdrama nonsense that's a farce of celebrity gossip.
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,Snow_Monky,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:33:57 2015 UTC,I am serious. Why would I not be?   I never said we all participated in it. I just said he was a well known redditor.
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,Clutz35,2,Sat Jan 10 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"As much as what Unidan did should be punished, I was sad to see him go. He had a genuine enthusiasm for biology and explained things very well. While people upvoted him for his 'reddit fame' I also feel like we all learned a little bit as well every time he posted. It was a shame to have lost that."
Luna_Lovewell,2ra212,Metafx,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:34:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, I kinda hated his pompous attitude everyone else missed. I know i wasn't the only one who noticed that through text, but meh... people loved him to death and I got downvoted to Bolivian as they say."

Luna_Lovewell,2qy8on,ColonelSander,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know! I like how an author with a promising writing style can earn some kudos through elbow grease these days... Long ago it all depended on some publisher screener liking it enough to pass it on....   Imagine how many great novels didn't past the skim test. now they  rot in the corner of someones basement, draped behind a shadowy cobweb veil of spiders long since turned to dust...  haha its contagious!"
Luna_Lovewell,2qxew1,Luna_LoveWell,60,Wed Dec 31 16:08:47 2014 UTC,"I stared at my screen, trying to focus on the criss-crossed grid of numbers open in Excel. But every time I closed my eyes, I caught a brief glimpse of the scrambled, wavy neon colors that I'd seen this morning. And I couldn't get the image out of my mind of the man's undecipherable stare as I'd taken off the helmet and mashed it into a small metal ball.   ""Cell E26 should be 814..."" I muttered to myself, trying to drown out my thoughts.  If it was a concussion or a hallucination, why did it stop as soon as you took off the helmet?  ""Cell F26: 942....""  Why haven't you had any strange visions since then? Wouldn't you have other signs of injury?  I was typing so loud that my keyboard was threatening to break in half with each letter pressed.   How had he known exactly what you were seeing?  I gave up; this wasn't working. I pulled my jacket on and stormed out the door of my office. My secretary uttered an involuntary cry of shock and scrambled to cover up whatever she was doing on facebook as I strode quickly past her desk. ""I just need to run to the store for a moment,"" I told her, already halfway down the hall. I couldn't hear what she said in response as I burst through the doors of our office and headed to the elevator.   I made my way to the CVS on the corner and went straight to that miscellaneous aisle that had everything from candles to 4th of July decoration. I stormed past office supplies and stacks of candy until I found kitchen goods. Soap, detergent, tupperware... Ah! On the very bottom shelf, the shiny rectangular box I was looking for: aluminum foil.   I strode back into my office just as quickly as I'd left. ""Is everything ok, Sir?"" my secretary asked.   I waved her off as I hurried back to my office. ""Fine, fine. Nothing to worry about. Just hold all my calls... and don't come in!"" I said with a slam of the door. I went to the windows and quickly pulled the blinds closed in a loud clatter of plastic. The sun still shone through the cracks in tiny lines of white light; the room was silent except for the gentle hum of the computer. From the bag, I took out the box of foil and pulled a long, thin sheet from the roll and laid it flat on my desk.  God, I really have gone crazy, I thought as I realized how weird this must look. But at this point, I had to know.   I wrapped the sheet of aluminum around my head, from the tops of my eyebrows down to the collar of my shirt. The base of the spinal column, I remembered him saying. That is where the primary receiver is. As I pinched off the top of the hat and curled it into a little metal ball, my vision swam like air coming off of black asphault on a scorching day. The colors began to blur and change in front of my eyes, and the static buzz filled my ears.   God, he was right...   I burst out of the office, and staggered down the hall, dizzy from the waving lines that made it impossible to stand straight. I slumped against a bright orange wall and pulled off the foil helmet so that I could see straight again. My secretary was sitting at her desk, frozen with the phone halfway to her ear and an unmistakable look of bewilderment.   ""Is... everything OK? Do you need me to call a doctor?""  I looked at the tinfoil hat in my hands, then back at her.  ""No,"" I told her, somehow out of breath. ""But I'm going back out for a while."" I got up from the floor and made my way to the elevators, gingerly holding my helmet so that it didn't lose its shape.  I made my way back to the corner where I'd first met the man; he was there, still wearing his foil hat and waiting with a knowing smile."

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,Luna_LoveWell,460,Fri Dec 26 17:51:33 2014 UTC,"""If you are not one of the Hoai, then you work for them,"" I told the human through the video screen, extending and retracting my claws. ""Your ships have the same designs as their faster-than-light engines. You even use their translator!"" I pointed to the hovering ball of metal that was spitting out my words in their guttural tongue.   Our ships faced each other across a vast expanse of space. Neither of us were warships; both unarmed. I was the captain of a colony ship, preparing to settle a nearby planet. Who knows what those beasts were out here doing. The tribal elders had informed us that this section of space had been cleared, yet there they were: Hoai pets. All we could really do was call for reinforcements and see whose military showed up first.  ""We don't work for them, Kahi bastards!"" the human said, twisting his face into a sneer. ""They came to our planet seeking refuge. They said that their own world had been devastated and they needed a safe home. Probably from you."" I took great pleasure in hearing that the Hoai had finally admitted to their weakness. ""In return, they gave us all of the technology need for interstellar travel.""  Something inside clicked. ""You did not have interstellar travel before?"" I asked, flicking my tongue into the air out of excitement.   The human squinted its eyes at me, and did not answer. ""What do you mean?"" it responded.  ""Before you met the Hoai. The ones you call 'Mites.' Did your species travel the stars?""  It glared at me; my translator inferred that it was suspicious of my intentions. ""We moved between the planets of our system, but not to other galaxies."" Now defensive, my translator mentioned.   I called for one of the elders of the tribe waiting in the hold.   ""And before you met the Hoai, did your species attempt to travel outside of your system?""  ""Yes,"" it answered slowly. ""Always unsuccessful. Something about the Oort cloud caused our ships to malfunction. Why, what's it to you? We're here now!""  ""And you do not know how they failed to penetrate the Oort cloud?""  Before it could answer, the Elder came onto the command deck. I bowed before him, and he bade me rise. ""You summoned me"" he stated.  I gestured with two arms toward the video screen, signalling my impatience. ""Tell this pet of the Hoai the story of our peoples. Tell them how we came to travel the stars.""  The elder glanced to the video, then back to me. Then back to the video.  ""The Hoai kept us caged like animals around our sun. As best we can understand from the records we found on their world, our planet was discovered around the time we first achieved flight. The Hoai took up positions in the ring around our planet and destroyed any vessels attempting to enter orbit. We struggled for years to understand the mystery of space travel, until finally our scientists realized the only possibility: we were being held down on the surface. Our next attempt as done in force: thousands of ships, built in secret and launched simultaneously. We overwhelmed the tiny stations around our planet, seizing their starships and reforming our own. We incorporated their technology, allowing our society to advance in leaps and bounds. When the Hoai reinforcements arrived, we were ready. Our crusade against them has continued ever since as we fulfill our destiny to settle the universe, unimpeded by those demons."" The elder closed his eyes as he finished the story and growled with pride at the perseverance of our people.  ""And now that you shelter them on your home world and do their bidding, you will be next."" I added defiantly.  On the screen, the human looked at us, then back at a screen to his right. ""He is perturbed,"" my translator informed me. ""The story of our people matches their own.""  The human looked back up at the video screen. ""I need to contact my superiors,"" it said shortly and flipped off the screen. I closed my own screen and stared into the vast void of black space between us. Perhaps these humans were not the slaves we initially thought they were..."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,lEatSand,313,Fri Dec 26 21:03:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna need you to write the whole book."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,kojakattack,401,Fri Dec 26 21:34:51 2014 UTC,"I'm thrilled that everyone likes it enough to make a book out of it. Maybe I'll think more about it and how I could develop a storyline in the universe. I like the idea of doing a World War Z style narrative, doing a short story as each chapter."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,CaveDweller12,84,Fri Dec 26 21:56:07 2014 UTC,"First off, great stuff. Doing a good job of keeping information linear and pertinent.  Might I suggest that if you intend to go further with this story, as everyone here wants, that you keep to alternating perspectives? I like it because it reminds me a lot of Issac Asimov's style with foundation, robot, and empire.  Keep us on our toes of whose the real villain.  Edit: replied to wrong post."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,kojakattack,65,Fri Dec 26 22:04:52 2014 UTC,"I agree with most. Except I don't think that having a ""real villain"" would do the book a service.  Each side is just trying their best, and it's killing the others"
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,thatonesquatguy,30,Fri Dec 26 23:28:15 2014 UTC,I agree. By real villain I mostly meant constantly changing opinions on each individual race. It's written well enough already to create compassion for each. Keeping it constantly morally neutral would create more of that suspense and interest
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,AldurinIronfist,12,Sat Dec 27 03:14:52 2014 UTC,"Totally agree. Having a clear ""villain "" is too storybook, that never happens in real life and it would detract from the realness of the book."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,akaCarbone,32,Sat Dec 27 03:33:23 2014 UTC,"If you will consider doing this, and need funds, or if you're going to start a kickstarter, send me a pm, I'm in for this.  Note that I am by no means a venture capitalist, just a university student with a job who just found something he wants to read.  If you need to bounce ideas off someone or need constructive criticism, don't hesitate to message me, either."
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,GreatWallofMinge,3,Fri Dec 26 22:34:48 2014 UTC,Count me in as well. Love your writings!

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,thatonesquatguy,19,Sat Dec 27 00:38:44 2014 UTC,I would buy your books.

This is one of the better plots I've seen come out of this sub; not only that, but the potential for expansion is huge. It's up to you if you want to write the book (obvious) but I think if you don't, someone else will. So please do it!"

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,kingmortales,2,Sun Dec 28 05:58:06 2014 UTC,OMG! World War Z style would be amazing. Each chapter a different person and different race. Perspectives switching. One chapter you sympathize with one race and in another you dislike them. It has so much potential.

Of course that's just what I'd like, WWZ was amazing too, and if it ever gets published I'd go to a B&N and buy one (I never buy things new)."

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,ser_dunk_the_lunk,1 point,Sat Dec 27 01:45:32 2014 UTC,I need more. This is so good! Can you expand on the battle that was first contact? Maybe from the perspective of a colonist hearing the battle  and escaping the city?

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,weedsmoker18,1 point,Sat Dec 27 13:43:58 2014 UTC,"I love what you did with creating a linear storyline from different perspectives. Do you think you could do something similar, except from individual characters instead of an objective third-person perspective? I'm a sucker for character-development, especially lone-wolf types in times of trial who do what they need to do with reluctance. I feel like this would fit in perfectly in an interstellar war between two ferocious species. It could be from the perspective of commanders, spies/agents, civilians, and all of the above being tied together in some sort of plot.  End oddly specific rant/request"

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,armadillhole,11,Fri Dec 26 21:19:55 2014 UTC,"A quick note, if I may? Interstellar travel and intergalactic travel are very different things. It would be unlikely for the Hoai to seek out human help (or know of our existence at all) if we were a technologically inferior species located in an entirely different galaxy. Travelling at even a million times speed of light would not be sufficient for reasonable intergalactic travel back and forth, and then there's potentially the whole mess of time dilation to deal with...  My recommendation is to keep the story (edit: the story thus far; don't want to make it sound like I'm imposing some kind of limit on where the story can go) bounded within the Milky Way.  Loving the story, of course!"

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,P0eticJustice,1 point,Sat Dec 27 14:57:54 2014 UTC,That was an awesome story. I read the first two parts also. My first thought was how it reminded me of Mass Effect and how vast and huge your story could get. Definitely the best Writing Prompt I've ever seen on here. I hope you do write more cause your story was really good. Awesome job!
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,JuggernautV2,1 point,Sat Dec 27 15:26:39 2014 UTC,"OP, along with being a kickass novel, this would make a seriously sick graphic novel if you got someone good to illustrate it, or could really benefit from some graphic-novel-style illustrations in some spots if you liked that idea. I'm not even the hugest comic or graphic novel fan except for just a couple of things in particular, and I don't even usually get very visually imaginative with reading, but something about this story really wants to be painted that way in my brain. The tension of the story and the species-development/character-development of the interactions would be done great justice by a good graphic novel illustrator."

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,MacrosInHisSleep,298,Fri Jan 30 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"The engines of the jet roared as we settled in for a landing on the icy Antarctic tundra. The jet was buffeted about by the strong gusts, but we finally touched down with a jarring thunk. The door popped open, and the wind howled in, covering us all in a blast of icy snow. I adjusted my goggles and stepped outside into the blizzard. The heated landing pad was slick with melted ice; I trudged to the end, where a waist-deep field of snow stood between me and Termite Town.  That's what we called it, at least. Officially, it was called something like Chandazazeria; it was the closest approximation of their name for it that we could get. Their mouths just moved differently, making it utterly impossible for us to actually say the name of the city. Or anything else in their language. If you could see it, it would be obvious why it had earned its nickname. They had carved enormous tunnels through gigantic mountains of ice and stone, riddling the enormous peaks with holes like a block of swiss cheese. Icy spires protruded from the sides like the Disney Castle. It was pretty amazing, really; they'd taken this barren, icy wasteland where even the desperately overcrowded humans refused to live, and turned it into a shimmering city. Everywhere underneath the surface, even more tunnels connected this area to the rest of the settlements across the continent. The 'Mites may have their weaknesses, but engineering certainly wasn't one of them.  My team approached the perfectly circular door closest to the landing pad; it sank into the ground before we got there, revealing a Mite delegation that ushered us inside. We shook the ice off as the entrance sealed behind us, stopping the howling wind in an instant. I removed my goggles and bowed deeply to the Mite delegate; he wiggled two of his mandible-like protrusions back and forth, which I had been told would be the standard greeting. The inside of the city was still freezing cold, but that's apparently how they prefer it.  ""We need to speak with your leader,"" I told them. A floating translator nearby lit up and chittered at them in their incomprehensible language. The 'Mite scuttled off without a response into one of the adjoining tunnels that sloped upward. He wasn't being rude; the 'Mites just weren't really interested in small talk. It's a cultural thing, I guess.  We hurried after him, as fast as we could go having to climb up the slick ice of the tunnel. Our spiked cleats dug into the surface, and we brought sharp walking sticks to help us up. The 'Mite leading us was nice enough to circle around, and sometimes over us, so that we didn't get lost. Somehow, their feet clung to the ice like velcro, allowing them to walk straight up walls and even on the ceiling. Crazy.   At last, he pulled off into a horizontal tunnel and chittered at us. ""His office is just this way,"" the translator told us in a calming tone. The ice here was so thin and crystal clear that we could see through it across the vast wasteland. Surrounding the city, tall black spires of stone pierced the thick blanket of snow and reached toward the sky, blooming with the red fungai that seemed to thrive in this cold environment. The 'Mites had brought them from their homeworld as a food source.   Finally, we arrived at the office. One of the 'Mites, larger than the rest and shaded a crimson color that apparently meant he was one of the eldest of their species, crawled down off the wall to greet us. The office was a tall oval, decorated with a number of bulges hanging from the ceiling, covered in a thin layer of frost.   ""How can I help you gentlemen?"" he asked through the translator. I reached into my pack and handed him the dossier containing all of the information we had about the attack on Summanus. Including photos of the creatures. He shrank back in disgust as he opened the folder to images of death and fire.   ""Do you know what these are?"" I asked sternly, pointing at the photos of scaly creatures stalking through the streets of New Jakarta, hunting down innocent citizens. The Mite was silent; the translator's lights lit up, searching for sound.   ""We have seen them before,"" the 'Mite told us as he flipped the pages with one of his many legs. ""They were from a neighboring solar system. Quite unfriendly."" Yeah, what an understatement. They just killed about 10 million humans.  ""We need everything you've got on these creatures. Anything we can use to wipe them out.""  ""We are a peaceful species,"" the Mite told us. As they had repeatedly told us since the First Landing. ""We do not know your ways of war. But we will give you what information we have."" He scuttled across the room and up the side of the oval, reaching one of the hanging pouches. His thin legs anchored to the ceiling as he dug through it. Must be some kind of storage, I thought to myself. After a moment or two, he came back down holding three of the round black spheres that they used to record data. ""We call them 'Kahi.' Our files on their physical conditions and technological prowess,"" the 'Mite said. He fed it into a small hand projector, and detailed schematics of one of the strange Kahi ships popped up, with the strange chicken-scratch 'Mite writing labeling different parts. ""We have nothing more that will be of use to you in your crusade. Please return to your vessel."" He handed us the spheres then somehow signaled to the 'Mite that had led us here. He ushered us back out into the tube of ice and down toward the landing pad. Were they trying to get rid of us, or was it just that efficient 'Mite cultural thing again?   Either way, it didn't matter; we'd gotten the information we came for.     Don't forget to subscribe to the subreddit!"

Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,TheMole1010,7,Sat Dec 27 12:25:48 2014 UTC,Really impressive. This has the makings of a really great book. How quickly you are putting this out is beyond me.
Luna_Lovewell,2qgkjb,pixie_chick42,5,Fri Dec 26 21:37:39 2014 UTC,"Can you write about a human fighting against the Kahi. Preferably someone who is highly ranked.  First contact would be nice, or maybe a soldier training to fight against the Kahi and his experience during the first contact.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"

Luna_Lovewell,2qg4ln,Voxel_Brony,1 point,Sun May 10 05:41:50 2015 UTC,You must construct additional pylons(stories)!
Luna_Lovewell,2q3hmf,Luna_LoveWell,2,Mon Dec 22 19:33:17 2014 UTC,I love the twist you gave it.  This is one of my favorites.
Luna_Lovewell,2q3hmf,KennyLog-in,2,Mon Dec 22 19:39:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I liked this one a lot, actually. And I didn't really have the twist in mind when I went to write it."
Luna_Lovewell,2q3hmf,NormalNONdoctorHuman,1 point,Mon Dec 22 19:43:00 2014 UTC,"I loved it, I was honestly dissapointed it wasn't from the love interest's perspective though, like the prompt suggested. We've all heard the Groundhog Day story and the many spin offs, and although your spin and twist was very interesting and great, having a perspective change like that is a very interesting idea."
Luna_Lovewell,2q3hmf,robotortoise,1 point,Mon Dec 22 22:36:48 2014 UTC,"Damn. That's so sweet...  Also, for a woman you write very well from a man's perspective!  (Might wanna add some bits about breasts next time though. Men seem to like that as well as eyes. Or maybe that's just me.)"

Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,Luna_LoveWell,15,Fri Dec 19 19:11:00 2014 UTC,"I dig your EU stuff. That, plus anything with super powers - you've got the next Hunger Games in your head some where."

Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,iwannastudy,1 point,Fri Dec 26 16:28:32 2014 UTC,Yea I love things with super powers
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,InterestingAroma,13,Fri Dec 26 21:59:54 2014 UTC,Space. Needs more space.
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,The_Insane_Gamer,4,Fri Dec 19 20:34:23 2014 UTC,I can do space. I like sci-fi a lot. Just hard to find a good prompt for it.
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,The_Insane_Gamer,4,Fri Dec 19 20:45:07 2014 UTC,Oh well
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,monday5,3,Fri Dec 19 21:29:08 2014 UTC,I'll work on finding good sci-fi prompts.
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,The_Insane_Gamer,2,Fri Dec 19 21:30:12 2014 UTC,"Check out r/hfy, they have prompts that would fit your needs."
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,grepe,1 point,Fri Dec 19 23:39:14 2014 UTC,"That would be nice, but all of your responses are good, don't worry too much about finding stuff that I like, find something you like."
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,canopus12,2,Fri Dec 19 21:32:01 2014 UTC,Head over to hfy for those.
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,The_Insane_Gamer,4,Sat Dec 20 03:40:09 2014 UTC,Try looking at /r/HFY. There's a ton of Sci-fi stories there.
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,RealSickOfThisShit,1 point,Fri Dec 26 18:27:23 2014 UTC,Subscribed already. But thanks for suggesting anyway!
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,InterestingAroma,2,Fri Dec 26 19:21:53 2014 UTC,This one's for you!
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,RealSickOfThisShit,14,Fri Dec 26 17:53:54 2014 UTC,"This might sound a little mean, but I would like an ending. It hurts to read all your stories and not know the conclusión to most of them. You really have a talent for writing, especially making a great introduction that hooks you and leaves you wanting more. I'm not asking for a huge novel of every prompt, but every now and then write a little extra to tie up some of your most popular posts. Ill still read every single one of your posts no matter what you end up writing about, but if I had a choice I would ask for the super power hunger games story to be the one you finish. I just gotta know how that ends."
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,LordBlackletter,2,Sat Dec 20 07:04:55 2014 UTC,Could you link me to the super power hunger games one? I can't seem to find it

Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,MyNameIsHax,3,Sat Dec 20 05:38:14 2014 UTC,"Hiya Luna. First of all,  I would like to express how much I love you. You are amazing! I love your prompts. What you are doing is amazing.  Keep it up. Would love to see a lot more of some EU prompts. Do whateva you want. Love ya. (BTW I'm a girl)"
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,Nugget_Of_Poo,2,Sat Dec 20 18:31:16 2014 UTC,"Vague prompts. Ones with the twist in them are nice, but when you don't see it coming it is so much more satisfying. Also, any prompt you write on :p"
Luna_Lovewell,2pta83,Jarmom,2,Sat Dec 20 05:05:02 2014 UTC,My favorite prompts are the ones you reply to.
