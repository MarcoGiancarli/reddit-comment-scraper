Maplestory,3e1lxm,Stupid_Otaku,5,Tue Jul 21 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"It really wasn't that bad pre-BB. Level 199-200 before the first pre-BB EXP curve change required 2,147,483,647 EXP. The first 200 got there at Skelegons, which gave 9,900 to 10,000 EXP. That means they would have killed about 214,748 Skele's on 1x to level.  Now, getting from 249-250 requires 650,378,595,225 EXP. Most people still grind at SDH, which gives 91,929 EXP. That means it now requires 7,074,792 mobs to level at 1x. 35 times what it was before.  The most significant EXP boost post-BB is a Kanna. Family EXP buffs were 2x before BB, and you could get a Pendant of the Spirit, HS, 2x coupons, etc all before BB.  The nostalgia for pre-BB leveling is seriously overrated.  It takes far, far longer to get to 250 than getting to 200 pre-BB ever took."
Maplestory,3e1lxm,jimmyvader,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, Pre-BB your damage was terrible and it required you to actually hit the mobs two or three times before they go down. You can't just say ""oh well it took less exp so it should be easier."" It took longer to kill something back in the day because we had no OP weapons and armor that gave you extra weapon attack other then the gloves and weapons and having 20+ stat on something was a high tier gear. There was a lot less mobility in the classes too, only rogue classes could flash jump and mages teleport but the other classes had to walk."
Maplestory,3e1lxm,RawrSean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Plus, tiger was definitely one of the few people who even had access to that top tier gear. Also, let's not forget that he has HS in that video. He probably didn't always have it.   +1 on the mobility argument."
Maplestory,3e1lxm,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"You don't need top tier gear when nearly everyone bought leech from A/M's or Bishops who could spam their ultimates at Skeles. Oh, did you conveniently forget that happened en masse pre-BB? My friend was selling 1HKO to 2HKO leech for like 10 hrs per day on weekdays pre-BB on a bishop. Don't tell me it didn't happen.  The mobility argument is moot when you can literally leech from a rope. And the ultimates had broken range pre-BB; the mages hardly had to move."
Maplestory,3e1lxm,RawrSean,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Pre-BB, sure, but let's not forget that we're talking version .25 atm. This was years before the BB. Back in .25, few people had the means to leech, and there were very few people high enough to even supply the demand for leeching."
Maplestory,3e1lxm,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"So, you're moving the goalposts now. Nice.  ""pre-BB isn't pre-BB unless it's before v25"".  ""It doesn't count unless it's when Ludi was out and Grims were the only things to train on xD""  Seriously, I'm done with arguing with you guys.  No one even got close to 200 back then because there wasn't a training spot for anything higher than like 120. I can divide the numbers for Grims as well - it doesn't make much difference for my argument. It would be around 1M Grims to level from 199 to 200, assuming each Grim is around 2147 EXP each. Still 7x slower than post-BB, and that's without 4th job, or a proper map to train on after 4th. Maybe to make it a fair comparison for post-BB I can use current ToT monsters as the proper training spot for 250?"
Maplestory,3e1lxm,LordHole,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:27 2015 UTC,I do miss when only rogue and mage classes had a fast movement skill. And when being able to haste was a big deal.
Maplestory,3e1lxm,Stupid_Otaku,3,Wed Jul 22 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"Lol, sorry for ruining your pre-BB circlejerk.  Mobility isn't a benefit when at SDH you're barely moving. You've seen the map; it's extremely small and you literally walk like 5 steps to spam your mob skill.  No, it really didn't. Back pre-BB the highest level players leeched off of ArchMages and Bishops who could spam their ultimates. They did not have to hit the mobs two to three times to kill them. Mobility is a non-issue because their ultimates can hit the whole map. The top level players would buy leech or train with mages who could 1 hit the map. Even 2 hitting is hardly slow when you can kill an entire map in the same time it takes now to kill a SDH map. Back then the party EXP formula was broken too, so partying always meant good EXP.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx1xIBGABD4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6vyXFrm8iQ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp97Msu5RFQ  Much movement. A jump down and a rope climb. Must have been sooo hard pre-BB.  Seriously, stop romanticizing pre-BB. I understand, everyone loves to put on their shitty rose-tinted nostalgia glasses before Nexon made the game p2w. But it doesn't make for intelligent discussion."

When you defeat a higher ranked player, your rank will increase more than when defeating a lower ranked player.""   Although, the biggest change there was that was not mentionned, is the amount of points you get is now also based off the time spent in the game.  I did some testing around, and winning a game within a certain time of a One Card round awards you   2 SP (about 25-30 RP) within 1 minute 3 SP (~45 RP) 1 to 3 minutes 4 SP (~60 RP) 3 to 5 minutes ..... 6 SP (~90 RP) 8 minutes and more.  This is pretty unfortunate. I use star planet mainly for the 2x exp coupon you can get from there.

Maplestory,3e4k2p,mrmplr,3,Tue Jul 21 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/mrmplr  I suggest you do this.  click ToTs know how on the left side of your screen (with all the quests) and get your free level up rewards if you can. it will set you up with a level 60 set of armor. after that, get your mage to around 140. once your there, you can do Dimensional invasion PQ. it will provide level 140 gear for you. after you hit 140, i suggest working on link skills.   Link skills are a good way to boost your damage, and try out all the classes in maplestory. You might find a class you like more then your F/P mage. You never know.  When you make your link skills, you'll end up training at sleepywood drakes (Best source of exp from 50 to70) and its a great place to spawn adn kill some elite bosses :) Ill leave you a link for elite bosses. Elite bosses are a great way to make some mesos. You can easily make 100m-200m a day off of just elite bosses with some luck :)  I hope that was helpful, but if you have any other questions, feel free to ask here, and ill answer them to the best of my ability.

Maplestory,3e4k2p,Pootaytoe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"CAnnoneer and Xenon give all stat boosts.  after that Kanna, Demon Avenger, Demon Slayer, Beast Tamer.  Maybe Beast tamer sooner than later since you can't make one anytime.   Timzzer has a great video series on making mesos.  you could do that with your link mules.   IN game, on the left, there is an icon next to the bottom that when clicked reveals a red haird boy icon.  That is tot and you can get levl 60 gear to get you going. once you are training, pick up weapons and armors.  I'd personally dive into link characters to get your footing.  You start at the beginning and by following Timzers videos, you'll have quite a few mesos too."

Since the ice/fire event is going on as well and you just came back you'll be an icy agent, a lot of people will want you for parties as you provide party buffs for them.

Maplestory,3e4k2p,CriticalFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my two cents in.  I'd start by looking at all the classes and seeing which one interests you most. If you like mages then F/P is a great one. I'd also look into Luminous. If you decide to keep being a F/P, log into the one you currently have and look for any reason at all to keep it. If it's under 140, has no equips, no mesos, or anything else for that matter, my advice to you is to start over. There's an event going on currently where you can make your character a ""burning character"" and this means every time that character gains a level, you'll get two more automatically until he hits 100, and when you hit 100, you'll receive a Frozen Equipment Set. You'll hit 100+ in a matter of hours playing casually. http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/updates/update-notes/00IcV#burn  Whether you decided to do what I said above or not, my next piece of advice is to make a Beast Tamer. It has an amazing link skill, and there's an event currently going on where you can get a ring that would be good for any mage upon leveling that Beast Tamer to 130. http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/updates/update-notes/00IcV#beastring  If you have any questions or play on Bera, feel free to message me here and I'll be happy to assist."

Maplestory,3e2exk,jamerduhgamer,4,Tue Jul 21 12:58:39 2015 UTC,"First thing, unlike previous or other comments, DON'T but RA gear (at this time). Currently two of them (I think Von Bon and Pierre) are glitched and don't drop CRA, which would boost the price on them.  As for gearing:   Start the Gollux and Commerci Pre-quests (or finish them if already done). Those two are BY FAR the EASIEST source of income in this game, plus they give really good equipment. Though if you've got a link mule that's 140+ or can be made 140+ (suggestion is Xenon, who has high damage output even when unfunded, which I'll get into later). This is because you can only buy the rings from the shop ONCE using the Gollux Tokens. On your main, you'll want to save up coins and buy, then sell, the Superior Gollux Ring. On the mule, you'll want to ""farm"" easy mode. The catch is this: You can only kill the head ONCE, so you'd want to look up a Gollux farming guide, but on the mule don't kill the head for the third run, but do another easy farming run, unless you know your mule is funded just enough to kill the head. The mule's coins will be going to buy yourself the Superior ring and Gollux Scrolls to scroll it with, so investing time into raising diligence on the mule can also be a benefit. As for gears you should aim for right now, your best bet is getting %luk gear or better gear in general. For example, killing Easy Magnus daily, as he can drop Nova equips (cape/boots), which would help boost your range. As for a glove, a High Quality Dimensional Invasion Glove scrolled for attack would really help. As for getting Starforce, about 5 to 10 stars should be enough, though I'd stick with 5 stars unless the max number of stars the equip can use is less than 10, for example, some shoulders only go up to 8 stars. Getting a Fafnir Dagger is also a must (Vellum isn't glitched, so weapon prices would stay the same). As for your shield/secondary, if you can obtain a Dragon Khanjhar or even a standalone Khanjhar and add attack and certain required potential stats (like %att, %boss, %PDR, %luk, etc etc) you would be set. Like in the FAQ side-bar Gear guide those are the gear and potentials you'd want to try to aim for, though its best to do so without resorting to excessive merching for pre-scrolled godlies or buying mass amounts of NX for them. Remember, diligence is your friend and so are events. Abuse them for scrolls, fever times, miracle times, farm reward points, become a miester smith to make your own cubes etc etc.   It'll be a long and tedious journey, but you will come out on top with the perseverance to do so. And judging by your equips (Like the Crusader Zeal Ring) you've been around for quite some time, so you know that hard work reaps for a bountiful harvest."

Plus the risk of getting scammed, since you're essentially buying a service that offers no collateral or other safety net to ensure that you get your money's worth. In contrast, if you take out the risk of scamming, it would be more of more benefit to buy EXP boosting service off a BT than it would from a Bishop/Phantom, since the BT player can easily leave his or her computer on without having to re-buff constantly or use a pet to buff for them (which can, to an extent, screw over your ""clients"" so to speak, since they'd have to wait for the re-buff from the pet) since all their buffs are auto-refreshing passives.  Though this really only applied to longer producer-client ""activity"". Basically, the longer you hire the player to provide those buff services, the higher risk of getting scammed (either the seller or the buyer can be affected). On the off-hand though, buying single-time buffs like Speed Infusion or Sharp Eyes or other similar ""unique class"" buffs for use in instanced runs like Dojo, have a lower risk of getting scammed."
Maplestory,3e04vr,GildedCreed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:22 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, assuming both parties (buyer and seller) are both legitimate, there's also a small system people would go to.  Nobody wants to buy these types of services if the person giving the service leeches.  As we all commonly know it's worse EXP to have to duo party with HS compared to you getting solo EXP. So, I assume the people who buy HS or BT are looking for those who don't take EXP away from you.  Assuming the person does leech, depending on where you train (let's say, Knight Stronghold or Copper Drakes) you would have to find 4 other leechers for you to have the same EXP rate as if you went solo.  And on top of not having a consistent HS or maybe one of the party leeches disconnects, it's somewhat rather difficult to find dedicated people.  There's also a thing about looting. For instance if I were to buy BT service they would also gain my coin share from looting mesos (meso bags split equally among party members.) So on top of the rate/time, I'm also giving them free mesos (and possibly items if they are looting. Beneficial if you don't have pet loot I suppose)  There's also an issue with greed among service sellers. I'm not going to pay any insane price for a small service that won't last me as long as I can proportionally measure it to be.  Arrogance could be a factor as well for those who think they are God for doing something that is not fully needed.  So really people hate it because of many other reasons. Scam, inconsistency, insane rates, leech, loot, those are really what comes out of the top of my head"
Maplestory,3e04vr,MasterofTheBaiting,4,Tue Jul 21 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"I feel that people that sell Kishin / HS are using what they have for profit.  That's a great thing.  HS'ers provide something that the only other way accessible is through payments via NX while Kanna's provide something that's not even accessible through the shop.  They have something that's of extreme value, why give it up for free?"
Maplestory,3e04vr,Noctis_Fox,4,Mon Jul 20 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"""If you're good at something, never do it for free"""
Maplestory,3e04vr,SmexyPro,4,Tue Jul 21 02:53:49 2015 UTC,"If you advertise selling buffs and then complain about people not buying them... it's annoying(And that's my experience with most people selling Kishin/Holy Symbol). Especially if the Bishop/Kanna is within leeching level and at the party's average level; in that case, you're essentially getting paid to have other people level you.  I hate people that sell Holy Symbol or Kishin when they're getting other benefits, generally free leech... it's something that every other class, if they're a buffer, gives for free. It's a part of the class that should be given for free as well on the same principal. Most people selling services also aren't playing the class; they're just using it as a mule and nothing more.  If it's 2x and people are willing to buy, I guess it's fine. After all, in that case if you're on a mule you're essentially paying someone for their time and loss of 2x. But unless you want to start paying ME to leech you, then you shouldn't be asking for payment for your Holy Symbol/Kishin.  That isn't even going into the whole scamming aspect on both sides of the coin, which could be spoken about for some time. But in short... people asking for payment for buffs, in my general experience, are generally not actually playing the class and trying to make a quick buck while doing other things(And often times they don't always pay attention), or they break the rules in order to avoid paying attention(Such as putting a weight on your keyboard to spam the buffs). All in all... I can't stop them from doing it, but I'm never going to pay you for something that's given to you for free; unless, of course, you'd like to pay for MY buffs, and MY time spent giving you the privilege of partying with me."

Reasons i can think of  1 theyre asking for money for you to train their mules   2 party play exp is gone theyre stealing your exp now and your paying them to do it   3 theyre can annoying
Maplestory,3e04vr,PositiveEmo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"I will not pay for it because someone will always do it free.

Maplestory,3e04vr,iSpecify,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:06 2015 UTC,"Some people buy them at Second Drill Hall during 2x, but most Bishops I know tend to either be tied to a party for free leech(Mainly since serious trainers have dedicated Bishops/Kannas); some people might also buy them while they level mules for specific spots(Drakes, for example), but those are far and few between.  The bulk of buff selling is at R&J and Second Drill Hall, since R&J is where people train Link Mules, while Second Drill Hall is where all the high levels who are funded train. Their popularity is the main reason anyone even tries to sell there."

You should be cubing the following: Fafnir/CRA set, Tyrant equips, Boss arena emblem, Ghost Exrocist Badge, Superior/Reinforced Gollux, The best secondary in the secondary shop/PrincessNo Secondary (if you can get it), Sweetwater Tattoo/Glasses, and other equipment that is for your ENDGAME.   Potential/Cubing almost anything else is a huge waste of money and time because you'll outgrow that equipment. The exception to this is training equips you want to transfer between many characters to level them easier.   For now just work on getting the boss emblem, ghost exorcist badge, gollux/commerci quests done, and saving up money. By the time you get all these done you should have a nice chunk of change and a good jump in range.

Maplestory,3e1604,iRedditUser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:36 2015 UTC,"What I do depends on how populated the channels are. If there's empty channels I'll do it myself but if it's full on every channel I'll switch channels and kishin every channel until the message pops up.   If I'm doing the second method I try to be as helpful as possible, talk with the people grinding, answer any questions they have, keep kishin always up, just in general be nice. When the boss does spawn I'll kill him about halfway (or more if they're struggling) and if it's one of the falling bonus stages I won't be on the top platform. I'll also stick around a bit after the elite boss and still kishin for them.  Basically just be polite and treat people as other players trying to enjoy the game instead of tools for you to farm. If you do that people will enjoy you being there and it's actually pretty fun."
Maplestory,3e1604,SDMagics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:05 2015 UTC,You spawn your own and do not level past 86.  IMO: If you steal elite bosses you are a greedy and lazy person.
Maplestory,3e1604,saiberyouk,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:29 2015 UTC,"The reason he says not to go past level 86 is because you need to be you can't be 20 levels or higher(lower) than the drakes so stay at 85 and when your exp gauge is filling up, go kill yourself until either 0% or low enough so you won't level up while mobbing.  You kishin and mob until you summon an elite monster (it'll be obvious because it's bigger than a normal monster) and you either get ""you feel something in the dark"" or "".....grim"". If it's grim cc, if it's not then wait until dropped items disappear and then start mobbing and summon another one until an elite boss spawns.  As for ""stealing"" elite bosses that means you just cc until someone summons one or get the message and run over and kill it. It's normal to some but irritating for others because they worked on summoning that elite boss and then someone who didn't contribute came in and killed it and has the chance to catch some purple boxes for free."

You can use any flame on gray dot items, so long as they can have additional options, while you can only use the flames you can craft and variants of those from events to flame items with white dots."
Maplestory,3e0cb2,Ascheric,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"This took me a while to understand as well, so here's my explanation. Normal flames (lvl110, 120, 130, 140 & 150 versions found from Bosses) works on items, which does not have the little white dot in the upper left corner of the item picture. As far as i know, all items that already has bonus stats when found, has that white dot and therefore cannot be reflamed by normal flames. To reflame those white dot items you must use the eternal flames. These you get from certain events and they add a random large amount of stats or the maximum amount of stats to the item. It seems that those eternal flames add more/less stats depending on the item level, so i wouldn't advice flaming over low lvl items, unless you have access to a lot of flames."

Maplestory,3e10uj,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"The absolute best is a Fearless Prelude (PSoKable). Good luck finding one, because the recipe for it only drops from Chaos PB, and you need a Timeless Prelude already made to craft it. That said, it's only slightly better than a freely tradable VIP shield.  The most cost effective option besides just buying the Holy Book would be the Last Unwelcome Guest Magician Shield, which is level 107. The level is important because only level 100+ ""weapons"" can get 40% Boss or 40% PDR at Legendary potential (secondaries are 'weapons""). The difficulty in finding a Fearless Prelude, and the additional expense of a VIP Shield aren't generally worth going for anything beyond a Last Unwelcome shield."

Maplestory,3dztgm,sikhened,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Bonus pot on weap to 2 lines of att would do the trick.  All your equips need 2 lines of %DEX instead of 1. You also have quite a bit of PDR, which is cutting into your boss%. Aim for 1-2 lines of Boss% on weapon and secondary. Recube emblem to 2 lines of pdr instead."
Maplestory,3dztgm,TheFlamingOne,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:56 2015 UTC,"Please don't do this. Getting 2 lines of %ATT on bonus pot for 3 items is extremely expensive.  The truth is, you just don't have enough power. Mercedes scale slow compared to other classes, so you just need more %stat and more attack. Getting Tyrants to 7 stars each is a start; ultimately you want 8-10 on each. Consider obtaining Dojo gloves, considering even a top 50 glove is better than what you have atm (even Tyrants only beat top 50 at around 7 stars with either a 12% stat line or a 15% min/max crit). You spent too much on the glove imo considering you can get an alternative for free. I see that your pants have 0 %stat  - it's unique, get it to at least 12-15% DEX. The other problem with your gear is some important pieces have no resale value - you cubed a level 100 Boss ring and an untradable level 120 Magnus shoulder. You should have cubed a Solid ring and a Meister shoulder instead. So this means if you cube it and get 21% of another stat, you will be unable to sell it or trade it off. You have a bad heart, considering you're missing out on 40-ish free attack if you made it 99 attack instead.   A priority for recubing is Gollux accessories. Get those to high %stats because they have lots of resale value if you get a high, but wrong %stat. Tyrants come after, and CRA after that. Imo, you shouldn't have bothered trying to cube SW considering you can buy cheap 20%-ish %DEX SW that are Unique on the FM.  Your weapon has 0 %ATK on bonus pot - get 1 line of 9% or 12% and stop.  You have 274% stat right now, and with link skills you're probably at 284%. At 40% ATT, you're definitely a bit low for a Mercedes. You need a line of %ATK on your weapon's bonus potential, but do not go for 2 unless you have a lot of money to burn."
Maplestory,3dztgm,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"Please, read what I posted. Getting 2 lines of ATT% (hell, 12% line would probably do the trick) on WEAP. Not emblem, not secondary. Just the weapon would do, as it's a LEGENDARY bonus pot that's of no use to him. Might as well not have a bonus pot at all then. He'd literally be solid with anything that benefits him, whether that be dex% or something else.  Why are you obsessed with resale value? For all you know he's planning on keeping this char as his main and will never switch, so all that talk about resale value is not helping him.  To be honest, you're giving him advice that only helps him achieve his goal, but the things you said he'd need to do that I didn't will make a future upgrade very expensive. He's losing so much boss% from having those att lines on his emblem. H'ed want at least 1 line of PDR and the rest att% and then get 2 lines of boss on his weapon and secondary, with an att% line on one and a pdr line on the other, IDEALLY.   As for bonus pot, all his bonus pots are frigging legendary, he'd have more att% just from recubing them all to 12% att and doing what I just said above, but end up with more boss% and same pdr.   I'm not sure why you think my advice was bad, I understand it being short, but it's definitely what anyone else that know's what they're doing would do. It's the same exact advice my 2m2m buddies gave me when I showed them my equips. Pdr and att% on emblem, boss on weap/secondary, 2 lines of mainstat on the rest."
Maplestory,3dztgm,TheFlamingOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:50 2015 UTC,"Even going for 2 lines of %ATT on the weapon itself is seriously expensive. As you said, 1 line of 12% ATT is sufficient. I have friends who spent 500k NX just going for 2 lines of %ATT on 1 item. Some didn't even get it. Bonus pot is the 2nd worst Nexon scam I've seen, after Miracle Circulators for IA (which follows the same formula, ironically, but getting that 1 line of Attack Speed is just as hard as getting 2 lines of %ATT on bpot). It lures you in by promising ridiculously high tier up rates, but rolling 2 lines of stats you want on it? Be prepared to break your bank. If you want to burn that much on another %ATT line, I would rather try for 12 stars on Tyrants, or even 15. Or he could just get more %stat.  Shuffling lines around on the weapon/secondary/emblem combo gives very minimal damage increases. He has 1 line of PDR on his weapon, and 1 line of %Boss. The %TD could go, sure, but he has 2 solid lines on his weapon. His secondary is finished. 1 line of %PDR, 1 line of %Boss (sure, a bit low), but 1 line of %ATK (the highest possible on a line, on the 3rd line). His Boss emblem also has 2 lines of %ATT. Ideally he'd want another line, considering he already has all of the %PDR on his weapon and his secondary. So right now the only things he could recube for is another line of %Boss on his weapon, and another line of %ATT for his emblem. He shouldn't recube all 3 of his gears trying to obtain the ""perfect"" PDR/%ATT combo on his emblem and %Boss on his secondary/weapon, especially when he already has 3 endgame lines on his secondary.  Resale value is important even if you don't bother to switch your character. What if he gets 30% LUK on his ring or his shoulder? Too bad, you can't sell it off or trade it for a %DEX one because it's completely untradable. And you would be seriously stupid to reroll a potentially tradable 30% LUK on main potential. This is why Gollux accessories, shoulders (and I guess, unequipped SW accessories), come before CRA and Tyrant. If you get the wrong %stat, but a high %stat on Gollux accessories/shoulders you can try to sell it or trade it off. If you get the wrong %stat on CRA or Tyrant, you have to keep recubing it for your own %stat, because no one will buy 30% LUK on a CRA Bowman hat.  Also, Mercedes do not need as much %Boss as you would think. They are a %TD heavy class. At most he can strive for another line of %Boss at 40% or 30%, and he's completely done with %Boss. He definitely needs a lot more %ATK as a Mercedes."
Maplestory,3dztgm,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"You're contradicting yourself. He has at most 1 line of %stat on most of his non-gollux equips and 2 lines of %stat on most of his gollux (12%). Most of his non-gollux equips are legendary too and giving 1 line of %stat, usually 9%. That's a really big waste, you could argue it's even not worth cubing to legendary at that point.   Are you aware of the fact that you can't get boss% on your emblem? Getting at least 200% boss damage (or close to it) is pretty ridiculous when it comes to damage output. Most of the 2m-2m players I know have over 200% boss. Getting tbh he'd be so much better off just recubing emblem for 2 lines of pdr and going for boss/att on weap and secondary with 1 line of 12% att on bonus pot. He'd see so much higher damage on bosses just from doing that. %TD doesn't make boss% less effective either. He'd be getting close to 280% extra dmg on bosses if he recubes for boss%."
Maplestory,3dztgm,TheFlamingOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"Level 100 Boss ring - 15% DEX.  Level 120 Shoulder - 18% DEX.  Hardly 1 line of %stat on most of his non-gollux equips.  I know what you mean though. The worst offender is his boot; it's only 9% at Legendary.  He has 200% boss damage...just look at his stats. He has 219%. http://imgur.com/a/ORZIE#22  Yes, I know you can't get boss% on your emblem. That hardly matters when he's already over 200% boss. He's even missing a 20-25% boss neb on his secondary. With the future boss neb and another 30 or 40% line he'll be ~ 280%.  Ideally, without recubing the secondary he could get either of the following:  Scenario 1:  Another line of %Boss on the weapon. This would be 2 lines of %Boss and 1 line of %PDR.  Another line of %ATT on the Emblem. This would be 3 lines of %ATT on the Emblem.  Scenario 2:  Another line of %Boss on the weapon, but the %PDR line becomes %ATT. 2 lines of %Boss and 1 line of %ATT.  Another line of %PDR on the Emblem. This would be two lines of %ATT and 1 line of %PDR on the Emblem.  And yes it does. %TD adds with %Boss, which means diminishing returns.  The formula is (1+Boss%+%TD) * (1+%ATT). You can even look it up.  http://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Formulas  No, he doesn't need to recube his secondary. God damn, what is with the mentality of you have to get 2 lines of %PDR on your Emblem and recube a perfectly good secondary in the process? You just need 2 lines of PDR over all of your gear. It does. not. matter. where. you. get. it. He is a Mercedes. The loss of potential %Boss from not cubing his secondary for purely %ATT and %Boss is not going to kill him. If he recubes to either of the 2 scenarios above, he will be fine."
Maplestory,3dztgm,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah my bad, didn't look at the stats. I forget that GMS has a really easy time obtaining boss%, as 280 is pretty god tier in EMS, which is what I mainly play.   It kind of does matter where you get pdr. Ideally speaking your damage will increase FAR more from boss% than it will from pdr. Once you hit the 2 lines of pdr, you've got enough, so why not let the emblem handle that and get boss% on weaps. If he recubes, he can hit 280 boss damage, putting him effectively at 325% boss with the TD mercs get.   If he then recubes the rest he'll get 105% of his normal damage (which should be high considering he's close to 2m2m) on bosses. I'm sorry, how is that not insane?  Edit: you're gonna have to point out what formula you're talking about, I'm not seeing it. Edit2: I did some googling and found that the formula is right, and found this while I'm at it. http://bossvsatt.blogspot.nl/"
Maplestory,3dztgm,TheFlamingOne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"Because if he goes for 2 lines of PDR on the Emblem he'll have to recube his secondary, which I've already mentioned, for all intents and purposes, is perfectly fine.  Pushing the weapon PDR line onto the Emblem (scenario 2) would be optimal (but only very slightly better than doing 2 lines of %Boss + 1 %PDR on the weapon and 3 lines of pure %ATT on the weapon), sure. Boss emblems also can't get a 40% PDR line either because it's not a level 100+ item, so I think it's capped to 30 or 35%. In the end, the difference between my two scenarios is miniscule. Both do not require recubing the secondary, which saves a ton of money in my opinion.  And Mercedes have well over 40% Total damage. 15% from Spirit Surge, Unicorn Spike is a 30% TD debuff, the Shadow Elemental Knight is at least 10%, Ancient Warding is a 30% TD buff, Lightning Roar is a 20% TD increase onto Ishtar, which also has 2 Hyper skills that give it 20% Boss (not included in skill window) and 20% TD respectively. That's 125% TD, and we haven't even included the DA or Kanna links, which are 10% each. 145% TD.  http://maplearchive.com/skill-wp.php?book=2310  http://maplearchive.com/skill-wp.php?book=2311  http://maplearchive.com/skill-wp.php?book=2312  No, he does not need %Boss that much when he will have 280% Boss +20% not counted from the Ishtar hyper + 145% TD for an effective 445% boss damage, or a 5.45x damage multiplier."

In the end I was unbanned (though because it affected hundreds if not thousands of players, they released an ""I'm sorry"" note. No compensation to the banned accounts so a whole bunch of people lost out on limited time events, I myself missed out on the Sengoku Pendant hot-day for Hayato/Kanna).  I also haven't gotten back any answers on if my account is ""clean"" enough to do their forum events for various IRL rewards (for things like special MapleStory merch like bags, water bottles, etc etc), since I don't know if that fuck up from Nexon affected my account's permanent record."

That character had the mercedes link skill, so I trained it to 10x anyways testing out sand rats and zakum, as Drextal had in his MM video. I forgot that they made it so you have to wait 24 hours for a character to delete after some level, so I had to wait that out and attempt it 25 hours later in the next 2x.   In the process of remaking a character I forgot to transfer the mercedes link skill, and your comment actually made me realize if I linked kanna, demon avenger, and xenon, I could have 1 hit some mobs sooner!   Also I listed a few ways it could have been improved, for example, a 2x use item instead of 1.5x, and having two EXP pendants (60% more exp).  Anyways to answer your request, I borrowed the gear from my friend (who played the kanna). It's mostly low level items scrolled with 5 all stat anniversary scrolls, as well as a pink tube weapon at level 50.

Maplestory,3dyi54,LeSteve,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen Ayumi's beautiful guide. However, she doesn't take into account some items:   You get a total of 18 sp from the animal gifts. You don't have to max skills with BT. You need a minimum of so many points to progress to the next skill in the tree but you may not want to max that skill (deep breath on bear) or the extra points (see my 2nd point in main post) will get you to cap sp on that skill instead. What this means is that instead of investing 280 sp into bear to max it out as Ayumi assumes you only have to invest around 220 for every skill you want. Same applies for all 4 BT trees."
Maplestory,3dyi54,GildedCreed,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"You can fully max 2 trees, but if you pick/chose between trees, you can get all you want from it. Like the Cat tree, that stupid yarn ball heal is totally fucking useless, like, seriously, level 18 in that skill and its like ~20% heal. Not 20% hp. A heal with the power of 20%. Level 1 cleric heal is better than that. And you also don't need to max the Dispell skil either, you just need to get it to a level you're fine with (getting it to a success rate of about 50% would do, or alternatively slap on Cygnus Knight links and just raise your status resist).  Like how in Eagle tree all you really need to get up to is the Mystic Door skill, though Regroup is a nice touch if you aim for that (free Hyper Teleport rock for party members in the same channel), and to do so you'd need a couple skills maxed, of which Fly is a nice to have skill when maxed, as is the vertical jump (the double tap UP skill). The defense formation can be left at level 1 (since you'll be primarily using Fly to move through vertical maps than for damage if just getting Door/Regroup, and you can double tap in any direction while in flight to do a Zero style phase dash)."

BT in bear mode absolutely wrecks with absurd damage lines and high damage skills. Can't say much about Leopard, its mostly mobbing/mobility mobbing. Eagle is iffy on the damage thing, since you have lower damage, high DPS, and more of a status-inducing utility damage (abusive with a bleeding skill with 190% tick damage). Cat has some high damage skills, but fairly slow with the standard attack button and lower %damage on the other attack skills (you have 3 attacking skills, one of which is your heal pad that doesn't kill the monster)."

Maplestory,3dub2o,made_this_at_5am,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:07:44 2015 UTC,"OK so during events when there are boxes, I usually reserve slots in my inventory for the garbage items that come out of them so that I don't have to free up 10 slots every day before I want to open boxes. That being said:   Comes from event boxes I didn't actually know how to get rid of this before this thread Comes from event boxes You might not like morph items, but I think they're fun, so I like to keep them The recipe items were moved to storage, but that's still only one slot. The contribution pouches are good for several days and allow me to finish the event quest immediately for several days in a row. So I'm saving them for that since I have limited time to spend on this game on workdays. The atmospheric effect was used, that's also only one slot. The trait items come from event boxes and as I mentioned above, I prefer to save them up and use them all at once when they've stacked to the max amount.   I save the Equip Enhancement scrolls so that I can use them on Nova equips on the off chance that 10 of them will work in a row and I get a valuable item either for myself or to sell.  Contrary to what you might think, I am actually capable of deciding which items I want to keep in my inventory based on how I like to play the game..."

I can store some chairs, but they are the kinds of chairs you want on your main. The issue is Nexon has given so many Untradeable chairs over the years, I can't mule the ones I don't need on my main. For instance, I still have all my constellation chairs. People say to toss them since I have the galaxy chair, but I put so much effort into farming those chairs that I'm not just going to dump them. They should be Tradeable now that the event is over. The only reason they weren't was so people couldn't exploit for the galaxy chair before the event was over.  The problem with Setup Tab is users either have it nearly completely empty or absolutely full, like me. Inventories overall need a reevaluation. Either go through all the old chairs and change their status from Untradeable to Movement in Account or Tradeable, or provide us a better way to store chairs. Otherwise, they could never make changes as you suggest, because although it works for you people like me would suffer immensely.  Oh, and they keep using Setup tab for event items, which for people like me is an issue. For me, my Cash Shop tab has a lot of slots, so I'd prefer putting them in there if anything... Other people might have that full..."

Maplestory,3dwo8h,LiarMS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:40 2015 UTC,Night Lord is getting nerfs as well if they haven't already. Drop rate move got nerfed. I never tried a NL before but I enjoy my NW so far. No Mastery Books are needed since it's a Cygnus Knight and at 4th job mobbing at RnJ is a piece of cake. Bat's combined with Jr.Boogie make for easy leveling since you won't run out of mana or HP. Mobbing isn't so great but your bats will fly around and snipe things while healing you so it's not too bad. Personally I like Cyg Knights because the no mastery books thing.
Maplestory,3dwo8h,SmexyPro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"NL lost some of it's do rate but gained some damage. NW lost a lot of damage, had it's utility skills needed, and got nothing in return"
Maplestory,3dwo8h,Voxous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"Meh, both classes are getting nerfed, though NW more than NL. In the end, I assume they will end up both pretty much on the same spot. In terms of funding, Night Walkers require less money, due to not having to purchase mastery books, and not having to use much hp pots thx to bats. Night Walkers have more single-target dps, but no mobbing skill. On the other hand, night lords have a good mobbing skill that also increases drop rate and exp gain by 10%(post nerfs), making farming much,much easier than night walkers."
Maplestory,3dwo8h,trentbat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:24:58 2015 UTC,NL is only kidding some drop rate. They got buffed in DPS
Maplestory,3dwo8h,Voxous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"If NW ends up in the same spot, NL will be better 100%,  as we then have better mobbing and equal dps."
Maplestory,3dwo8h,TheFlamingOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I'm maining a NL right now, and I have to say I've never had this much fun on a character. The exp is amazing! The 40% exp we get (until nerfs that is) stacks with HS and 2x events/cards so you can get 8,4x exp on a 2x event. I leveled my NL from 196 to 205 in 4 hours.  As for damage, you'll have more single target dps on NW, but wont have decent mobbing unless bats can onehit wherever you're grinding. The 1v1 is comparable. I remember a friend of mine saying that once you cap on cvel, you really dont care about the 2 mins NW will solo it faster in.  IMO, NL is more fun than NW and wont get absolutely gutted. We lost some bonus exp and thats it. We still level fast, and nothing of our dmg was touched."
Maplestory,3dwo8h,TheFlamingOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:22:34 2015 UTC,We also got some more damage. The poison hyper will deal 1000% instead of the current 100%
Maplestory,3dwo8h,Voxous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"Nerfs or buffs aside the fact that Nightwalkers can jump attack and have TWO streams of stars flying at mobs seals the deal for me.  I duno about NLs but I'm pretty sure they can't jump attack and therefore only a single stream of stars will be thrown at a time, jump attacking also increases attack speed by 40%? not sure"

Maplestory,3dwb5a,Ayrend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:53:41 2015 UTC,"I'd start off by saying first, keep the Beast Tamer. At the level you have it now, it's link skill will give Boss damage +7%, Critical rate +7% and MaxHP MaxMP +4%. I actually enjoy BT for being such a versatile class since you can switch animals so freely and SP resets can be bought for mesos now. But if you don't find it fun, definitely move on. I can answer the BT questions. 3, They aren't the best bossers, especially if you use bear and the boss is able to freely move around the map, otherwise you'll always be using the same skill to deal damage. 4, Depends on the party. If they only need HS, you'd probably get dumped since a bishops HS gives a higher percentage of exp."
Maplestory,3dwb5a,CriticalFire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"If you're only partying the BT for HS, something's wrong. BT have a passive SE that stacks with Archer SE, passive Rage/Meditation that stacks with those respective skills, etc etc. And because BT's exp skill is never off, the moment the Bishop forgets to re-HS, the BT exp skill goes into effect the moment HS disappears from the list of buffs. In other words, they lap over each other, but the highest value takes effect. BT's is 30%, and if HS, for example, is 31%, HS takes over, but if HS is 29%, BT's will take effect. So if HS hasn't been rebuffed, BT's takes effect since 30% is obviously greater than 0%."
Maplestory,3dwb5a,GildedCreed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:28 2015 UTC,"They do decent damage with Bear's amazing passives. Leopard to about 120, and Bear to 250 for grinding. No comment on bossing, left mine a mule. With Cat most people who can't 1hko/want a bishop that doesn't need to be HSing constantly/attack too slow/grind faster/want better drops, etc. grab a BT to help them out"
Maplestory,3dwb5a,DettaBlink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"1, 2, and 3   The most common BT build is Bear/Cat. Which is to say, Maxed Bear tree and Maxed Cat tree, with some of other trees added in. They have a pretty solid damage output in Bear mode (which is their main bossing form).   4 and 5   Bts are accepted in high level maps, even when a Bishop is in the party as not only do the EXP boosting skills overlap (as in, if the Bish forgets to HS for X amount of time, yours will go into effect the moment the HS buff disappears, but they don't stack on each other like 2x tickets). BT also have a party SE that stacks with normal SE, so lots of players can get 100% crit easily during party grinds. While Leopard is 99% mobbing skills, Bear has mobbing as well, and they don't drag you recklessly around the map while also providing high damage output with passive modifiers within the tree like attack speed +2 and other passive attack buffs."

Maplestory,3dunnn,pmstr,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"It's awesome, for anyone who actually likes to play the game. The maps are large, the spawn is good even without Kishin, and the EXP is greater than Stronghold.  However, if you're one of those lazy people who just prefers to mash a single skill in SDH, it's not for you. Not only are most of the maps tall as well as wide (with multiple platforms), but there are active safeguards against AFK trainers; debris falls from the sky in maps like Skyline and Black Heaven's deck, and some mobs like the Salvageroid (red and blue) can summon missiles to rain down in certain locations."
Maplestory,3dunnn,Neospector,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:18:17 2015 UTC,I think preference over SDH is mainly more because its a compact map and you get more out of a single mob skill rather than jump around and attacking the biggest mob.

Once your 140, start doing Dimensional invasion PQ to 165.   Step 2) Pour 200m-300m into getting a full Chaos Root Abyss set. (Might be more expensive since your a thief.  Step 3) Complete your Gollux and Magnus prequests and start running daily bosses with a guild if you can.  Step 4) Get reinforced gollux from doing gollux runs, and see if you cant find someone to take you on a Hard gollux run for a cape (People in my guild were nice enough to take me and give me a free one)  Step 5) Start farming daily bosses and elite bosses to make mesos. (if you would like more info on Elite bosses, let me know, i can help you out)  Step 6(OPTIONAL, ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SPEND NX TO GET STRONGER FASTER) Cube a CRA weapon, a level 100+ secondary (Bought from Nevile in leafre or henesys) and a boss arena emblem. These are the only 3 items in the game that can get %att and %boss damage potentials. %att is better then %total damage, and %total damage is better then %luk on your weapon, secondary, and emblem.

Maplestory,3dtn6v,gg533,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, Hero has many great damage output. Even Advanced Combo, including hyper skills, is way better than dark knight 3rdjob buff. It also has no restriction using its skills. Easiest funds in term of % ignore def, can have temporary 100%+ status resistance from Lv150 hyper skill, extra critical damage by using 4th job Puncture, which can also give more crit dmg to party members! Also Rage.  I have to say, dark knight is not much better for mobbing, it can recover HP faster and it can't spam gungnir very much unfortunately. And Hero has even better rush skill than dark knight, it can go farther. Hero can also pull ennemy.  So, I would say Hero. Personnally, I have no idea why many people want bash Hero, especially when some never tried the class x.x  Btw, I am a Hero Councillor, in maple leaf council."

Maplestory,3dtn6v,Bigicefire,2,Sun Jul 19 12:13:59 2015 UTC,from 1-100 Hero's a pain but from 100-200 its realy fun IMO   While DK is complete opposite
Maplestory,3dtn6v,MwSkyterror,0,Sun Jul 19 13:20:07 2015 UTC,Easily dark knight.
Maplestory,3dtn6v,GildedCreed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Dark Knight. Hero is one of the many classes that, while they're strong and pretty damn good at what they do, tend to be replaced with other classes that ""do their job, but better"". For example, a 2H hero looking to maximize their damage would naturally hunt down or RNG through Tower of Oz's last few stages for Ryude's Sword, while a Kaiser would also do the same, but given that the Kaiser has more overall DPS than the Hero (mainly because Wing Beats), the Kaiser would have more damage.  Alternatively, Sword + Shield warrior would require more overall funds than a 2H sword warrior due to requiring an Attack-scrolled Shield and a heavily scrolled 1H sword, which boosts their DPS, but lowers their total damage output because they lose the 2H bonus from a 2H sword or 2H axe.  And with 2H Axe warriors, while cheaper to fund, they're also slower on DPS unless you've got decent SI, Swiftness Ring (level 1 through level 10 from Tower of Oz, which boosts attack speed by 2 stages for a small duration), or are in a party with a Tb or Bucc.  Dark Knight, on the other hand, uses Spears and/or Polearms, weapons which have a smaller niche players (due to Arans presumably having low DPS, probably because of how their combo system works on a keyboard+mouse set up. Unsure about aran players who use an Xbox or 3rd party controller like MadCats with Maple. Controllers can be configured under Joypad Settings in the setting menu for those interested).  But the bottom line is, Dark Knight is easier, to an extent fund than a Hero, due to the small fact that the DrK branch uses a weapon that is easier to obtain (Spear/Polearm, mainly spear because PA are used by Arans as well) than a Hero's (2h Sword used by Kaiser, Dawn Warror, 1H sword used by Paladin, Mihile, Dawn Warrior) unless going the route of 2H Axe Hero, then they're easier to fund than DrK since 2H Fafnir Axes are one of the cheapest Fafnir weapons in the warrior branch (mainly because people don't use it or prefer not to)."

Normal Magnus becomes accessible at 150k, patience required, but at 200k Normal Magnus is a joke. Hard Gollux comes at 175k. Empress becomes available around 500k (again, made much easier with respawn tokens). I haven't done Hard Magnus yet, but seems to be 700k is enough if you are good.  Evans are pretty much gods of doing things at low range, except for possibly I/L."
Maplestory,3dq53m,RiceIsBliss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"You can't use respawn tokens in Empress. It has a death count of 5 just like RA now, which means you can't use wheels. And I would be very surprised to see an Evan solo Empress with 500k range, or Hard Magnus with 700k. You would have to be doing at least 15m lines on Illusion for the former.  https://youtu.be/mD_Gl9vLDMc  He recommends 750k-1m for Empress.  https://youtu.be/qYdyKuB7hAc  This guy had 1.1M range and didn't even come close for Hmag.

Depends on how you feel, I guess. If you still have any old equips that have nostalgic or aesthetic value (since we have fusion anvils to change equipment appearance), or if you prefer your character's appearance, go with the old one. No harm no foul now that Matilda's shop offers AP resets.   Aside from which account I use, is there a suggestion to which server I should be in with the best blend in population and cheaper FM items?   Scania is the largest. Personally shout-out to the GRAZED (Galicia-Renegades-Arcania-Zenith-El Nido-Demethos) alliance since I'm in there. I've heard people like to talk about the MYBCKN (Mardia-Yellonde-Bellocan-Chaos-Kradia-Nova) alliance.   what is the best way to earn mesos now   Depending on your level, you can farm normal Zakum and sell the Sunset Dews. Selling permanent cash equips will always land you a lot of money. Some people farm Gollux to sell the earrings and other accessories.   Should I wait until there is an event that favors newbs   I'd say there is one right now. The Burning Character event should allow you to triple-level-up (every time you level up normally, gain 2 additional levels) while you're below level 100. If you can find a ""Hot"" player to party with and train, you can gain additional EXP and such. And the Beast Tamer character is open right now."

Maplestory,3ds1l5,Neospector,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"Lower than Scania, but there's plenty of people there. The FM fills up to at least room 9 in channel 1.  I can't tell you the exchange rate. It's against the TOS to trade cash for mesos. Rule 4 on the sidebar, too."

Hmmm so is it worth the time to ditch the characters i made in Windia in which i had a Lv 198 Lumi and the characters with link skills up until post... Whatever Xenon was an onwards?   Nah, probably not. If you're feeling lonely you can always create a new character anyway.  ""Hot"" characters are part of the events happening now. Characters played within a certain timeframe before the Firepower update were labeled ""hot"", and those who weren't played or were created after were labeled ""icey"". Hot agents are supposed to party with icey agents and vice versa, they get prizes and extra EXP and such. You can also become ""besties"" and get extra goodies.  Also, yeah, rule 4 is about cash transactions. You can't buy NX for mesos. However, you can sell things like permanent NX equips or chairs, that's legal and encouraged to get them out in the market."

The extra character slots you may or may not have will be helpful, but if you decide to make a new account, the new default is 8 which is good enough too. If there's any decent level characters left, they could help with link skills/character cards.   I think most people would tell you to farm elite bosses and sell the drops for mesos, which you can do without too much trouble on a fresh account. I've never purposely gone out and channel hunted for them, most of my pocket change comes from selling the pots that drop from Zak/Hilla/RA, which go right into getting mastery books for new characters."

Maplestory,3drx81,Neospector,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"Back during the early days, some restrictions were coded in with rings to make them incompatible with some other rings. I'm not sure the reason why they chose to do this, it might have been a way Wizet/early Nexon chose to structure equips that has since been abandoned with the addition of so many new equips. Some rings still have this restriction.  Gollux rings in particular do not have this restriction: First, they're newer equips, and secondly and probably more importantly, they weren't designed by KMS (KMS does not have Gollux), so their only restriction is being unable to wear two of the same ring (you can't wear two superiors, but you can wear one superior and one reinforced)."

Maplestory,3drmxu,moxxob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"Never tried hero but I have a lvl 115 dk and it's pretty good overall. Decent HP, Okay mobbing, and great bossing. Dark Impale is so fun to use."
Maplestory,3drmxu,mrsotobean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"I've never played Hero before, but they seem pretty rare. Also, like mrsotobean suggests, Drk is really fun to play imo. Op buffs like cross surge and dark thirst which increase your range by alooot. And lord of darkness which makes you not need any health pots basically(you'll probably have 3k+ power elixrs and elixrs). Drk has great bossing because of sacrifice + gungirs descent combo which you can combine with a nearby ruin of swiftness and weapon booster for crazy dps."
Maplestory,3drmxu,marketani,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:41:33 2015 UTC,Are they decently good at mobbing? I mean this will be my second char after a Lumi lol so I know I can't really beat that
Maplestory,3drmxu,Tripl3ag3nt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"Heroes are so dope, my main is a lv178 hero and could solo czak way back when he only had 50k range. When I started, I was very quickly able to hit over 1m per line with raging blow because of adv. combo attack + rage + enrage and he was really cheap to fund. Nobody uses 2h axes so you can get a really cheap weapon there and iirc heroes are quite high on the dps chart. Like dk, they have enough HP to not have to worry about dying in bosses and their lv150 hyper skill gives a really nice damage boost. Plus throwing in puncture to give monsters a status effect and magic crash for the icing on top, Hero makes for a great bossing class.   In terms of mobbing hero was fine, Rush given at 3rd job after the RED patch now is really helpful and raging blow has a pretty lenient range of monsters it hits. I wouldn't say hero is anywhere near above average but he was fine for me.  I have a dark knight as well (~lv120) and its really good too, 3rd job gets the spinning spear thing skill and that was a blast to use, but overall I favor Hero. It's kinda fun being a class that not many people use :)  Either way you wont go wrong, both of these classes are great :D"

Maplestory,3dqcae,AdventL,3,Sat Jul 18 12:33:44 2015 UTC,I believe star force enhancement adds stats depending on the current stats of an item. IE. Better scrolled item means better enhancement stats.
Maplestory,3dqcae,darkfalcon123,2,Sat Jul 18 12:50:23 2015 UTC,"For armors and accessories, you gain 2 all stats for each star at 1-5 enhancements and 3 stats for 6-15 enhancements. For weapon, it depends of the attack (or magic attack) on the weapon itself. You will gain the same number of all stats like armor plus   4atk if your weapon has 150-199atk | 5atk if your weapon has 200-249atk | 6atk if your weapon has 250-299atk | 7atk if your weapon has 300-349atk | 8atk if your weapon has 350-399atk | etc.  It's recommended to fully scroll your weapon before doing any starforce enhancement on your weapon to gain the maximum atk.  As for the number of stars on your equips: Star Force Tiers Here are the different level tiers for the max star changes: Lv. 94 or lower: 5 stars (Superior equipment: 3) Lv. 95 – 107: 8 stars (Superior equipment: 5) Lv. 108 – 117: 10 stars (Superior equipment: 10) Lv. 118 – 127: 12 stars (Superior equipment: 10) Lv. 128 – 137: 13 stars (Superior equipment: 12) Lv. 138 or higher: 15 stars (Superior equipment: 15)  There is sometimes some random stats you can also get, but it's some specific case (atk, hp, mp).

Maplestory,3dqcae,Slatymate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:12:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for your detailed response. I'm actually checking to confirm if something I've read on the Maplesea forums is true. That is that  enhancing items from 15 stars to 16 stars will add 8 WA and enhancing items from 16 stars to 17 stars will add 9 WA. The item in question is the theif fensalir glove. :)
Maplestory,3dqcae,sirrenitee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:53:58 2015 UTC,You can't go past 15 stars anymore. It probably would have if the items at 15 stars was below 399watk and at 16 stars past 400watk making the 17th give 9 watk in the past before the star force patch.
Maplestory,3dqad4,bovey4231,3,Sat Jul 18 12:08:14 2015 UTC,"I posted this on somebody elses post so lemme just repost this tl;dr  extract sup crystals from dipq, zakum, and hilla equips to make (give or take,) 10-30m a day. Additionally its hard to find fast spawning mobs with little hp for elite bosses. So make a kanna or a class with a high dps and farm elite bosses in sleepywood. You should be able to hit 3-5 elites every 2+ hours right there. But you have to be between lvl. 46-85 to get rewards. From the boxes you can get protection scroll(300m), clean slate scrolls(30m+), innocence scrolls (60m+), unique pot scroll(1-2b), meister cube(220m), master craftsman's cube(100m), chaos scrolls 60%(1m), chaos scroll of goodness 30-50% (10-15m), epic pot scrolls (100-140m) and I think safety scrolls(?). There is also the chance to get cubic blades from elite mobs which are worth around 9-14m. Its easier to sell these things in a shop because you can raise the prices. Do the maple content book for evolution system to get extra evo lab coins. An advanced pot scroll is about 30m and is only 250 coins in the evolution lab coin shop. When youre level 140,farm gollux coins everday to get enough coins for the advanced pot scroll and advanced equip enhancement scroll, worth the same as adv pot scroll. Gollux also gives equips worth a hefty price, but its up to you as to either wear those equips or sell them, because you can only purchase them once with the coins. Dont forget to sell the sunset dews and reindeer milks you get from elites and daily bossing for 2-6m a day.  As somebody else here suggested, start buying things in fm ch1 lobby because they are cheaper and then sell them at a shop for more. A shop is only 1.7k reward points. These methods get me about 200m-2b a week. But i usually spend al0t so i only have like 299k mesos, rip. Also if you need some quick mesos and i have some add me, my ign is Secreteas and it seems we're both on bera"

Maplestory,3dqad4,askmiller,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:52 2015 UTC,you'd use the owl of minerva which you can get at any pot merchant except sleepywood. you just type in the item and it shows you what everybody else is selling it at. Generally I sell for 1%-3% off everybody else
Maplestory,3dqad4,ilayad8,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"What I've seen work is basically hunting for epic bosses and selling the drops.  Depending on your luck, you can make anywhere from 15-150m in about 40 minutes or so.    Also, if you have enough nx for a shop permit, you can make quite a lot off becoming a merchant for items dropped from epic bosses.

Maplestory,3dmjpy,Turtledude13,20,Fri Jul 17 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the 3rd job flash animation. Let me find it. If I don't post again in like 10-20 minutes, I haven't found it.  Edit: I had it saved back in 2013 http://www.southperry.net/showthread.php?t=66991&p=1143147&viewfull=1#post1143147  The site I had it hosted on is dead now though. Let me try to find it, the flash's name was ""The Third Flight"".  Edit 2: http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/ The flash relied on loading images/assets from other sources for it to work correctly. Without those sources it is half broken. I recall the flash having images of the third job skills for each class. Each character in the images was named their third job name (I thought this was so cool back then) like ""White Knight"" was the White Knight.  Extras: I opened the swf.  http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/bg.png http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/icon.png http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/192_bgm.wav.mp3  http://i.imgur.com/ZxPvzPF.png Launch date  Final Edit: I have looked through the entire SWF with JPEXS Flash Decoder and I have concluded that the assets for the jobs are NOT within the SWF. There is a bit of Korean text within the SWF but nothing compared to what we are missing.from the job pages.  http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/korean1.png http://tria.tv/images/thethirdflight/korean2.png    Final Edit 2: I decoded the actionscript from the swf.

Maplestory,3do54a,etgohomeok,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:32:14 2015 UTC,Is that because they're a different type of coupon than the cash ones?

Maplestory,3dp79q,llirving,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to farm fafnir weapons by yourself as you need to defeat a chaos root abyss boss for them. You should work on getting your chaos root abyss set (top, bottom, helm, and fafnir wep). To do this you'll need to buy them in the fm which you'll need more meso for. Prioritize the weapon first I'd say. Doing dimensional invasion pq is a good idea: you can loot the lvl 140 equips that the mobs drop and extract them using someone's extractor with a 1 meso fee in ch 1 ardentmill. This will get you superior item crystals which you can sell for 300kish each depending on your server. This is a good way to make meso. Also you should farm elite bosses to get clean slates, cubes, epic pot scrolls, prot scrolls to sell in the fm. Once you get enough meso to get a full cra set, work your way up to buying a superior gollux set (this will cost a lot more.) good luck and have fun! :)"
Maplestory,3dp79q,OneFineLad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for the info!   I guess I'll look around for a decent weapon then :) and getting money won't be easy, guess I better pick up a profession. Which is the one for extracting the item crystals?"
Maplestory,3dp79q,OneFineLad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"You don't need to learn a profession to use someone else's extractor. But to extract equips you would need to learn alchemy. I personally recommend you to not learn alchemy, though. I'd say the best profession to learn is mining to make money. Then you can learn accessory crafting or smithing. But with a high level mining you can make wisdom/luk/dark/black crystals which you can sell for a decent amount of meso in the fm."
Maplestory,3dp79q,Ascheric,2,Sat Jul 18 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend always learning alchemy on your main character and leaving the other two professions to mules on the same account, all the worthwhile stuff produced by the other two are either tradeable until you equip it or tradeable within your account (like cubes), while learning alchemy allows you the ability to both fuse and extract equips and to use two different alchemy produced potions at the same time which is useful for doing bosses later on. You can learn both Herbalism and Mining along one of the other three, so you can be both a miner and an alchemist."
Maplestory,3dp79q,juuree,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:25:20 2015 UTC,DIPQ is great but I've also kept leveling at Romeo and Juliet PQ with people around my level during 2x.

As for what to do at 150, I was fortunate to level most of my characters over this hurdle when good training spots were available, and I recently just got my BT to 161 playing it casually. I leveled him in the Romeo and Juliet PQ till 160. Next I'm going to do Star Planet daily and get my 1h 2x coupon, and do normal Horntail, Zak, Hilla, and Magnus, which should take under an hour to complete, so a good use for the 2x coupon, and mess around in DIPQ. I should hit 165 reasonably quickly, from there future henesys, do quests till I can get into drill hall, and drill hall it from 165 to 200+"

The full-map skill is on the Delete key, and I have buff skills on the Home, PgUp, PgDn, and ""H"" keys. Potions on all my characters are on F9-F12  I use those because it feels more natural to me to have the attacks I use the most nearer to my left hand, whereas my right-hand controls movement with the arrow keys and rarely moves, so skills like buffs and skills with large cooldowns go on the right.

Maplestory,3dnup7,UpDownLeftDiagonal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:02 2015 UTC,I always get nxowned so I just have a feeling that if I get 70+ red cubes that I'm gonna get screwed over. I've heard that blacks are significantly better than reds?
Maplestory,3dnup7,InfamyHD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:35 2015 UTC,Yeah Black Cubes have a higher chance to tier up when compared to red cubes.
Maplestory,3dnup7,xkaishun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:28:45 2015 UTC,Thing is you pay double the price but the probability of tier up is not double of red
Maplestory,3dnup7,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it is around double of red, if not more.  I'm interested in watching any MT videos after Saturday's MT, especially where people consistently get a tier up to Legendary in 1 pack of reds."
Maplestory,3dnup7,Stupid_Otaku,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:22 2015 UTC,I don't believe that's a fact about the blacks being less than double
Maplestory,3dnup7,UpDownLeftDiagonal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"Why would you roll black cubes on junk Legendary pot? Even if you only have one line, or even two - if you want to recube something you're fine with getting rid of the potential. Black cubes for stats is the most dumb thing I've ever heard. You're spending double for a reroll."
Maplestory,3dnup7,xTaq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I would use black cubes on ""something I like"" just to be safe.... It says that in my comment dude."
