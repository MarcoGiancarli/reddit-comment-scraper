Generally GBA ROM hacks are distributed as IPS patches, which have a .ips file extension and can be easily applied to a clean ROM with a program such as Lunar IPS by opening both the ROM and the patch file in the program and clicking patch.  Some bigger hacks, such as DS hacks, are distributed as .ups files, which require a different patcher (like Tsukuyomi), but are functionally the same besides that."

There is a limited supply of money as well (at least until the E4 I guess), so either you suck it up and carefully buy and use the Ultraballs or you deal with whatever you catch with the first bunch of pokeballs you get. Eventually, you'll get to a city that sells Pokeballs (and I think all the other balls as well) but by then you'll probably want Greatballs or better.  As a side note, if you're playing Light Platinum you'll probably want to keep the walk through walls AR code handy, since there seems to be points where a dialogue checkpoint can just fail and you get stuck. You may have to walk through people/walls and hopefully trigger the next checkpoint. Just a suggestion if you plan on continuing."

You, and people like you, really need to watch your own videos before uploading them.    You mentioned in a comment that you need a new mike, but that's not the issue as evident by hearing the first few seconds.  The issue is that you blasted the volume of your game wayyy too loud.  And this is especially bad because you use the fast forward key; nobody wants to listen to loud fast-forwarded ""blurrbbppelelbup"" at all.  I mean you can ""yeah lol XD"" it all you want, but it's just bad.  Nobody's lol-ing with you.  And writing it off like that makes it seem more like you're trying to jump on the ""ooh I wanna play video games for internet points!!"" train than trying to show off anything of substance.  Finally, your speaking is awful, but this is something that comes with practice.  You need to enunciate clearly; your words sound like mostly the same sound with no spacing between them.  I mean, I can understand what you're saying; I just don't want to, and that makes the difference.  Let me stress this again.  You really need to watch your own video before putting it up.  You and everyone else like you (because there's definitely going to be someone else with the same idea looking at this).  I think the biggest fault with most LPers is they don't watch their shit, put up their shit, and then just ""haha lol it sux XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD"" with some expectancy from the audience."

PokemonROMhacks,3d3oe4,trademeple,2,Mon Jul 13 07:08:22 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean by the files inside a ROM. If you mean the image files and tile maps you can use unLZ.GBA to browse through them, or use Tile Molester to view data that isn't compressed (Although you would see a lot of seemingly random data in between the odd image).  Unfortunately, it is not possible to see the source code of a ROM. All that's stored in the ROM is the compiled binary, not the source code it comes from. You can disassemble this binary, which basically substitutes each binary code with a word describing what it does in the Gameboy's processor, but that is still far off the source code and is very difficult to understand.  There is a project called OpenPoké which has pretty much reprogrammed something similar to Pokemon Fire Red from scratch in C, so you could have a browse through their source code. The project isn't completely finished and hasn't been updated in a while, so you would have to do some work if you want to create your own ROM using it."

I can instantly tell that they were from a hack which to me is disappointing. I like looking at maps and thinking these are as if game freak made them. This revamp of Ecruteak is to open for what it should be. Open and Cluttered at the same time. and the route gate should NOT be on the rocks so it looks bad. Make the map smaller and less open as well as clear up the clutter and it will be better.   Sorry if it seems like I am being a dick, but this is my opinion."

PokemonROMhacks,3cvloy,speelchackersinc,2,Sat Jul 11 05:15:59 2015 UTC,"LG and FR didn't use a battery for the official games due to the exclusion of timed events. All the memory is flash. Though I'll give these new games credit: they are using flash memory now, albeit low quality flash memory."

PokemonROMhacks,3cvloy,Marxvile,2,Sat Jul 11 11:06:59 2015 UTC,"Time was introduced in Gold and Silver, yet Firered and Leafgreen do not have time events for... Some reason, idk.  Saying that though, they could still be legit just corrupted for any reason like turning off mid save or whatever. It's hard to tell for sure, but if the GBA games case are the respective versions color, then it's more likely to be legit. I'd say don't toss them out because of this one thing, play it for a while save, turn off, turn on and see what's what. If it deleted the save then, then... Well, sorry."
PokemonROMhacks,3cvloy,Vhin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't going to toss them haha. I'm actually going to try and hunt down a second gba so that I can test out a few things on them, like trading Pokemon between legit Gen III games.  If you've read some of my other responses, they are definitely fakes though, no doubt about it now. Not that they don't work, they just don't have any ""real"" value. As far a bootlegs go, they are damn well made, and I could see them lasting for a while. My goal is to play through at least LG and see if it makes it to the end-game without totally crashing/corrupting.  And on a side note: Firered and Leafgreen did not include time events most likely due to the original Red and Japanese Green not having time events. I could be wrong, but that has always been my assumption."
PokemonROMhacks,3cvloy,vide0freak,2,Wed Jul 15 11:09:48 2015 UTC,"The ""previous file will be loaded message"" has nothing to do with an internal battery. Generation III games save both the most recent save data and the one before it; this is so that, if your save file corrupts, it can go back to the one before it (which hopefully isn't also corrupted).  You can get that message if, for example, you turn off the power during saving. From what you've said, there's no reason to think your game is fake."
PokemonROMhacks,3cvloy,vide0freak,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"After further inspection (though I really didn't need to look deeper haha), these copies ARE FAKES.

PokemonROMhacks,3crt2f,etruj,2,Wed Jul 15 02:08:27 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what this glitch is. I just checked it and the tree should be blocking the path before you go through the checkpoint building. If you do not have a pokemon with cut in your party, how did you get to the Fly HM house in the first place?  I've had reports of graphical glitches in the area from cycling road but not this. Perhaps it was a one time error, or perhaps a result of the cut tree event having been moved in the first place (I am VERY new to all this and do not do the scripting, I thought it was ok to move the scripts around though)  Currently we are working on version 1.4 or 1.5 atm, which is editing trainers, then some events, and then map errors amongst other things edited and added since the last public release (1.2) before another public beta release, which will be close to the final version."

PokemonROMhacks,3ca2kc,FurryWolves,2,Mon Jul 6 07:39:25 2015 UTC,"What you're asking would be quite difficult to do. The screen on a GBA is 240 x 160 pixels. On an emulator this is scaled up for your pc screen (depending on your settings of course). An emulator mimics the hardware of the GBA, so the game creates the graphics data for those 240 x 160 dots and the emulator just scales it up and displays it on your monitor.  It would be possible to create a custom emulator based on a GBA but with a larger screen size, however you could run into a lot of problems if the processor and the memory on the GBA are not sufficient for more advanced graphics. You might well have to dream up an entirely new system. This custom emulator would not be able to run original GBA games either, only your custom ROMs, unless there was built in functionality to switch between two different systems or something.  AFAIK nobody hase tried anything like this before. It would be a very interesting project, but likely very long and difficult. You would need to build your own emulator, or modify an existing one (VBA is open-source). You would also need to make tools to create new ROMs or convert GBA ROMs and their graphics to the required format.  If you are interested in having a go, here is a tutorial on making an emulator for the GB (I couldn't find anything for the GBA) and here is some info on the GBA's hardware.

The game just produces these triangles, so an emulator can render these triangles to a much higher pixel density than the original console did without too much modification.  It is much more complex for the GBA as it uses sprites for graphics which the game's code draws to the screen directly."

It covers all three generations, a solid weakness/resistance triangle, and they are all three pokemon that I would use in a regular campaign anyways. Also easily obtainable in my hack in the wild-as are main series starters."
PokemonROMhacks,3c7a50,darkchicken113,3,Sun Jul 5 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"As long as they starters are roughly equal in potential it should be fine. My personal preference is that if you're going to do traditional starters, to alter them a bit in terms of moveset, ability, or even typing to get a unique experience. Most people playing rom hacks are overly familiar with them otherwise, making them boring.   Then again, that could just be me."
PokemonROMhacks,3c7a50,Rangetwn3,3,Sun Jul 5 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"I would like starter pokemon that are fairly uncommon and have 2 or 3 evolutions. For example, Spheal, Mareep, and Growlithe.  Also, an extra little bit, if your into doing a bit of extra work on your hack, try doing something unique. For example, 5 starter pokemon, fire, water, grass, electric, and fighting. Also an idea I've had if your into doing a ton of extra work or if you are a good artist, is making starter pokemon have more than 3 evolutions with some changes of when they evolve. Like...   Tortoise (level 5, smaller squirtle with all legs on the ground) - Squirtle (level 14) - Wartortle (level 30) - Blastoise - (level 48) - Blastadon (level 72, looks like mega blastoise with some dragon features, is now a water and dragon type)  Anyways, that's only if your going to be extremely dedicated to this rom hack, if you're just doing it for fun then disreguard most of what I said lol."

Basically, what I had in mind, was either finding or learning how to make a Game Boy Color emulator since they're older games (1 MB) so it would be easier to program in terms of emulator and the bot itself.  However, I have noticed with ROM hacking tools people can find out what the stats of gym leader Pokemon are, I am wondering how I would do this on the go while the ROM is loaded, then basically I would have to figure out what steps I would need to take in order to say ""Oh, I need to go to Oak"" so the bot would look at what tile I am standing on, and if it's grass, (non-Pokemon spawn-able grass) look around me and see if there are spawn tiles, etc. But I am just wondering, what would I need to learn?

PokemonROMhacks,3av7ww,P8ntBal1551,5,Tue Jun 23 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"Google Emerald 386 hacks. There are plenty of hacks that are edited to have every pokemon available at some point or other in the game, but you'll find many of them have a difficulty increase.   I know for a fact a Crystal 252 hack that doesn't increase difficulty exists called Complete Crystal."
PokemonROMhacks,3asafk,happy_pants_man,6,Tue Jun 23 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"My goal with this hack was to make Fire Red a little more streamlined.  There were a lot of things about Fire Red that were kind of aggravating, from the Sevii Islands not offering much of anything to good Pokemon (like Arcanine) being REALLY far out of the way.  I wanted to fix all that.  You can catch every single Pokemon before ever leaving Kanto, but it's not ridiculous like some hacks where you're wading through 11 Pokemon over and over just to catch that last Pokemon with a 1% encounter rate.  And every area is thematic, so fire Pokemon are here, water Pokemon are there, starters are there, and so on.  Every gym leader now has a full 6 roster (and Brock's Solrock and Lunatone at that stage in the game were awfully difficult), and no gym leader has repeating Pokemon (adds variety).  Though Lance does have pre-evolved forms to some degree (since there were only so many Dragon types).  There's a Physical/Special split, and a lot of Pokemon and attacks have been tweaked oh-so-slightly (Charizard is now a Fire/Dragon type instead of Fire/Flying).  Now your HM slave might be worth carrying around and leveling up, with the HMs being significantly altered (except Fly and Surf, which were already pretty strong, though Fly was given a slight base power increase).  I'm currently working on inside maps like Viridian Forest, Mt. Moon, etc., and the Sevii Islands, as well as working on events that give the Sevii Islands more ""stuff"" going on, so you're not just wandering around long-winded pathways to catch one little Pokemon and then leaving.  This is necessary since I already said all Pokemon can be caught before leaving Kanto, anyway.  I'm not sure yet if the main Kanto storyline will alter since I don't have a lot of good ideas, but the map IS a bit more open-ended (you can just skip Cerulean and head south, if you want, then go east from Vermilion to Route 12 and bypass that Snorlax and head all the way down to Fuchsia), at some cost (you'll be weaker, and the Pokemon and trainers there are still at their standard levels!).  I'd like to tweak the trainers, but I'm having issues motivating myself to do that given how many there are.  I may just tweak a few.  And many of them can be bypassed entirely (a lot of them you have to TALK to to start a battle)!  I'm open to a lot of feedback and suggestions, though, both in gameplay mechanics and the aesthetics of my maps, so feel free to tell me what you'd like to see.  Special thanks to /u/alwaysupvoteTRUNKS for motivating me to continue this after my first attempt failed miserably."

PokemonROMhacks,3altng,purpleslug,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Have you done some serious playtesting yet?  I was about 80% done with my romhack (I had edited every single map except the insides of homes, wild encounter rates, trainers, evolution changes, special/physical split, etc.  All I had left to do was to edit the Pokemon stats themselves and a few attacks I felt needed more buffing, but that's more technical than anything else, so it was effectively playable and ready to be released), double checked the events listing on Advance Map to make sure all warps and scripts were in place, got into the game, and made it to Cerulean City.  Rival wouldn't appear.  The bottom half of Route 5 disappeared entirely (the map size was suddenly halved in height, leading to garbage in-game where the bottom half should have been).  I couldn't go from Celadon to Route 16 because the warp events disappeared.  Red sprites appeared all over Vermillion City (which are known to crash the game) and not a single building could be entered.  And where a lot of scripts should have been, they were either ignored as if nonexistent (in the case of the SS Anne guy checking to see if you had a ticket or not) or they turned into a repeat of whatever TM the Gym Leader gave me's explanation or giving me a powerful item (usually a Master Ball) followed by an infinite loop of garbage text that I had to shut the game off for.  I managed to fix almost all of them, but this came at the cost of constantly losing the ability for wild encounters to appear in Pallet, Viridian, and Route 22 (as in, the entire data under Advanced Map's Wild Encounters editor was gone).  And again, this was after double checking to see that everything looked perfectly fine, booting up the game, and playing it.  I'm now literally starting over from scratch (which is a lot faster since I know what I want to do and what I want things to look like), and I'm basically making sure I play the game to some significant amount after every 5 or so maps and encounter data I edit.  I'm also modifying my maps to make sure I don't ever have to relocate a script (because maybe a trainer or a signpost was on a tree I put in and it needed to go two tiles to the left to be okay) until I know for sure I'm good."
PokemonROMhacks,3altng,happy_pants_man,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your knowledge. I just spent an hour testing (because your message actually kind of scared me), and so far I've only come across map errors-my own, and weird things like odd fast current tiles appearing in the black borders of Mt. Moon tunnels, screwed up mapping on the borders where I've put new areas in the cities-but warps work just fine, houses, NPCs, trainers, Rival, encounters, Magikarp sales-everything working smoothly.   I do have to ask-how do you test? I replaced the Cubone starter with a level 100 Mewtwo with a PP Max to plow through but didn't change any movement permissions to bypass anything like I did when I encountered my Mt. Moon warp issue a couple days ago.   Here are all my map errors documented, if you know of any solutions to certain ones I'd be much obliged.   Now, were your problems caused by editing encounters and maps/movement permissions or were you screwing around with scripting? Personally I'm not trying to mess with any scripts aside changing hidden items. Scripting is very intimidating to me and something I'm not yet ready to do. I mean I see these original hacks everywhere and figure it can't be too hard but at the same time I feel like an 11 year old frustrated because he can't figure out how to work his gameshark.   Okay, one last thing-will putting a tile over say, a signpost or hidden item screw up the game, or is just relocating a script?"
PokemonROMhacks,3altng,happy_pants_man,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:16:25 2015 UTC,"how do you test?   Any time I play, notice a stupid map tile I didn't notice, quit, and fix it, I make sure to delete the .sgm and .sav files.  So yeah, I wander on through with a 100 Mewtwo, too.  EDIT Oh, the reason I delete the sav and sgm files is because I know for a fact one of those messed up my movement restrictions and erased a few scripts I had originally moved.  I don't know which one it was, but I wasn't going to try and find out.  But I'm no more expert at this than you are.  I don't mess with the ""border tiles.""  I just manually edit the borders like I'd edit any tile because I've seen a lot of what your weird border problems are on other hacks and that's one issue I've thankfully never run into.  But I'm no more knowledgeable about how to use this than you are.  I literally started my own hack about two weeks or so before you first posted anything, and now with my second attempt I've managed to do all the cities (and any immediate links between them and routes, like Cerulean and Route 24) and Routes 20-25 and haven't run into issues, but I'll probably be giving up soon.  You and I basically have the same idea on almost everything.  -_-  I do know for a fact, though, that using door tiles as anything but doors was what caused me to have my own warp tile issues.  There's a door in the given Vermillion set that looked really neat as a tile for solar panels, so I put those tiles on every single home.  The game apparently only has enough space for so many warp points, I guess, so that was why I saw the deletion of everything.  Found a new tile, though.  Also, making Unown a random encounter in Mt. Moon crashed the game for me.  I had to get through it with Repels to keep pushing on and seeing the rest of the game, figuring I'd fix that problem later.  I don't know if it's Unown specifically or what, since the rest of all Pokemon loaded just fine wherever I put them.  As for the rest of my errors?  I don't know.  I already said I know thus far I'm 100% error/glitch/problem free, but that's because I'm making damn sure to only move very, very few people and keeping all doors where they initially stood so a new Warp isn't spawned and building around that.  I still don't know where those Red sprites came from, and I hear that can happen a lot.  And scripting is actually the only thing I feel comfortable with, now, because I know everything works because I keep track of everything meticulously.  It's definitely intimidating, but I think once you do your first non-door/non-sign/non-generic-NPC-speech script, you won't find it bad at all."
PokemonROMhacks,3altng,happy_pants_man,3,Mon Jun 22 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  Interesting about Unown; looks like I'll have to make that a static encounter.   I've fixed a few border tile problems I was having in A-Map, they were pretty obvious.    I'll probably be giving up soon. You and I basically have the same idea on almost everything. -_-   Don't just give up on your hack. There are tons of Fire Red 386 hacks out there; doing a little research on my own slightly discouraged me, but I reminded myself I'm doing this hack first and foremost for myself. I'm making the version of Fire Red I want to play, making encounters available in the places I think they should go (there's a list of Pokémon by geographic region on bulbapedia I consult when I make encounter lists), editing rosters and stats and stuff to boost the pokemon I feel are underused and deserve those boosts. Isn't Noctowl awesome looking? Too bad it normally sucks! Know what? Dark subtyping! Raised stats! New move set! Now he's a whole new player, an anti-psychic bomber that could displace a Swellow or a Fearow on the team. Why the hell does that guy have a level 9 Caterpie? He's like an area boss! Level 14 Pinsir! Yeah! Cerulean Cave is supposed to have scary strong pokemon, and Parasect isn't scary strong... but Machamp is! You see what I'm saying? That's what I want to do, but it's not the be all end all of basic Fire Red 386s. Just because you have similar ideas doesn't mean yours is going to feel aboriginal-you can't have Armageddon without Deep Impact, you can't have Marvel without DC, you can't have beer without wine. I'm working on an Emerald hack (sort of, it's taken a back seat to this one) and you know what? I was referred to a hack called Emerald Z that pretty much did what I was going to do... but not exactly what I wanted to do and I'm not giving up because of that. I hope this has been encouraging."

PokemonROMhacks,3aijsd,IronElephant,3,Sun Jun 21 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Pallet: Yes, I agree. Grass tiles above houses are rough. Good looking edit otherwise.  Route 2: Nice flower/hedge patterns! Does that righthand gate have a guard blocking it on first visit?   Route 21: Have you considered editing stats of other pokemon to be similar in strength to starters? It's one answer to the ""people bypass everything for starters"" problem.  Viridian City: I like the direction you took that grassy area. The first draft looked like a maintained garden and I felt like it needed some explanation for being so organized and boxed in by hedges. This new draft really looks like a clearing in a forest. Overall better look  Viridian Forest: Looks great! Not much for me to say. I have an idea though. What if when you surf East or West on the river you could get to another location. Like Hidden Grottos from gen 5 or Mirage Spots in gen 6. Could a be nice spot, just a 5x5 grassy area for rare pokemon or an empty space with a static legendary. Just a thought."

On stats, I'm bringing up the Nido line to be on par with the starters since they're some of my favorites, as well as possible edits to the Mareep and Spheal line, probably going to tweak the first Gen trade evos a little too. Either people will bypass everything for starters or use their favorites. The cubone and baby lines will get a boost, as will the Johto bugs and birds. Eevee will be more useful without evolving as well and probably get some better move sets on his evos.   On the Viridian River, I ultimately want to have the ends connect to each other to allow surfing from Cerulean to Viridian and possibly beyond when I try to recreate Johto, but that's pretty far away.

PokemonROMhacks,3afpng,CrashmanX,2,Fri Jun 19 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do this, but only with a special flashcart, such as the Supercard DSTWO if you want it at any good speed."

PokemonROMhacks,3a5k5e,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,6,Wed Jun 17 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"At this point all I have left are editing the encounter lists in Pokémon Mansion, Seafoam islands, Victory Road, Cerulean Cave, and Safari Zone; editing a few pokemons base stat totals (baby, Nidos, three bird lines), abilities, and held items; editing Gym Leader rosters and reviewing Rival's rosters; and deciding where I can stick the legendaries, of which there are 11. Thinking about stuffing them all in a cave somewhere.   Altogether, 70% complete. I would say it's ready to test run by Monday at the latest if I'm able to work on it for a few hours every day after work.   EDIT: so in hindsight, rough cut release next week isn't as likely as the end of the month as I'm going to review the encounter lists I've done and make certain adjustments to these maps and a few others. I'd like to thank everyone for their enthusiasm and comments. I'll keep this sub posted.  EDIT 2: I've edited Viridian Forest and the encounter lists up to Route 4 for balance.

One suggestion I have which you can feel free to completely ignore at this stage, it that your grass is in solid blocks which makes it look a bit ""busy"" in my opinion. In the games they seem to have little gaps every so often just in the middle, so it's not so solid.

PokemonROMhacks,3a5k5e,IronElephant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Celebi has a 2% encounter rate in 3 areas. I'm thinking Mew in Cerulean Cave and maybe maps that require use of an HM move to activate a warp to another map holding others- like a new cave outside of Bills on an island to surf to, once inside you use flash and it warps you to, say, the burnt tower in Ecruteak where you can encounter the Johto Trio, and a similar mechanism in a different cave will warp you to the the top of Sky Pillar tower to face Rayquaza, etc. I'm reading up on tutorials to make that happen right now."

Except in battles. Battles while fast-forwarding in DeSmuME do go super fast.  I got spoiled by VBA and now it all feels so slow :(  tl/dr fast-forwarding in this helps a bit, but nowhere as much as VBA"

You'd need to add your own new Pokemon (and there are mods for that, including patches for all 649 Gen V 'Mons - the game can index up to 65536 unique Pokemon but realistically only 999 of these are able to be used) but from there it's easy. Just give Blastoise some evolution data of its own to evolve into a fourth stage. Breeding ought to work still, since the game just (with the exception of Wobbuffet and Marill/Azumarill) backtracks to the very first evolution. I don't see why it couldn't take three steps back instead of two."

Many, many people would post their ""first ever hack"" thinking they were the bee's knees. You'd be surprised how many people replace Pallet Town's houses with caves, You can leave your house fine, but if you want to return, oh no. None of that. Why don't you take a trip to Navel Rock or Birth Island instead?  And who needs traditional starters? Choose from Mewtwo, Salamence and Glitched-out-Aggron!

Then I inserted an unnaturally powerful Machop with an attack boosting ability and stats so hacked it could solo the entire game 386 no dex. Boring by Pewter.

So, obviously, trying to implement fakemon was the first thing I tried to do in a hack, but I think I've come quite a long way since I started out. Here are some of the first sprites I made, and that is even some of the better ones from when I started out. Compared to some of my more recent ones, like this one, I like to think that I've made some progress :D Also, the stats I used to give them in the beginning were outrageous, every single fully evolved Pokémon had like a BST of 600 or more, it was ridiculous."

PokemonROMhacks,39jcp8,Sceptile90,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"Would it be possible to add a second type for each type, so there would be, for example, fire(physical) and fire(special) types that would have the same type interactions otherwise? Then set every move to have the appropriate type, and it wouldn't matter which version of the type Pokemon had since the type interactions would be the same. Although STAB might be an issue, so you would probably need to find a way around that."

Unfortunately it's not available for Ruby. :(  There's actually a patch for the Diamond and Pearl and onwards type physical/special split! There's two patches. One for the moves, and one for the icons by them. Here's the thread on the process of making it, here's a video showing the two patches in action, and here's the patch itself.  The guy does make several mistakes though - Mirror Coat should be special, Vine Whip, Razor Leaf, and Bullet Seed should be physical, and there's a few others. But it's mostly good, and I recommend you run through the entire list (yeah, the whole thing - it doesn't take too long though!) in your utility of choice. Pokemon Game Editor seems to natively support the feature, and all it really is is changing a single byte. Open up the drop down list, open up this Bulbapedia page, and get to work!"

PokemonROMhacks,39b81r,KingBubblie,2,Wed Jun 10 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"Research, effort, time, etc.   One of the big things is difficulty in creating new tools when the tools for Gen III already exist. There's not a whole lot for Gen IV specific features to justify so many new tools."

PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,3,Sat Jun 6 07:02:00 2015 UTC,"I do occasionally like to catch 'em all.  If the romhack is great, I like to play one game of trying to catch them all, say ""okay good I did it,"" then never do it again except maybe MUCH later down the road (which I did with Ultra Violet).  But I can give you a good example of what irritated me in a game like Pokemon Volt White.  White/Black are designed that you basically play 2/3 of the map before the Elite Four and the other third after.  In those 2/3, you can basically fill out the national dex except legendaries before you're even done collecting badges.  It typically amounted to like ten different Pokemon per area, so it was a real pain in the ass trying to catch something I actually wanted to use that only had a 5% catch rate.  5% catch rate isn't a problem, but sharing that 5% with 3 other Pokemon while it seems like the RNG gets stuck on some mon it likes is, where some 5%-er seems to be more like 90% until I save the game and turn it back on.  But that was kind of the point, right?  Get access to everything so you can do whatever you want come the end game.  That's fine, but then there were issues with placement with a lot of them, and a great example I can give is Eevee.  Eevee was found in only two places.  One place it had an appropriate level but a 5% catch rate.  Meaning if I wanted to max out the dex, I was grinding a LOT when it also shared the 5% with THREE others in an area with NINE Pokemon spread out.  I spent like four hours trying to catch enough to get all of its evolutions.  And the reason I did was because the other place had Eevee at 20% (much nicer.  In fact, I ran into four of them back to back), only there was a huge glaring problem:  that Eevee was already at level 40+, meaning it missed out on a LOT of moves I'm particularly favorable to with its evolutions.  So I wasn't going to bother with that.  In the case of Volt White, it seemed there was an obviously better possible implementation of everything--the doubles grass area.  In Volt White's case, the doubles grass area, instead of having DIFFERENT Pokemon, simply had the next evolved form of the normal grass Pokemon.  I felt that was a wasted opportunity except for people who are trying to minmax.  So for my personal desires?  I would steer clear of making Pokemon with multiple evolutions (Tyrogue, Eevee, Clamperl, etc.) rare or putting them in spots where they'd be over leveled.  And then there was Volt White's endgame.  There was a lot of shit to do.  I'll never do it.  I'll never get around to it.  It seems interesting to explore, but I can't because I'm not good at Pokemon, and I was never looking to minmax or build the ultimate team, so I absolutely don't breed or EV train, and yet every single trainer on the other side of the map where the endgame content was was either a Gym Leader in disguise with ramped up Pokemon or just had ridiculously strong Pokemon that I couldn't deal with.  Obviously, the game was designed for a challenge in mind.  Well, I don't want a challenge forced on me.  I'd like to be able to revisit gym leaders on my own time and I'm certainly all about the rematch against the Elite Four, but these are trainers placed on tiny paths blocking me from moving because of their line of sight, and I couldn't easily get by them.  I was finally able to enough to get to all of the towns so I could fly to them from then on, but I'll be damned if I'm going to try and weave around them just to access a new area in my quest to capture a new mon.  There's a way to screw around with everyone's movesets and types without deliberately ramping up the challenge.  It keeps things fresh but doesn't make me have to plan for each of the next 38+ trainers.  Nor does it make me have to just use Generic Best Team Posted On The Internet With Specific Moveset #27258.  ""Then play another hack.""  I would.  Except it seems all the quality ""all pokemon in game"" hacks are either challenge based or have ridiculously juvenile humor thrown in which completely detracts from the experience.  So, to your questions:  -Yes, at least initially  -Favorites and I try to give other Mons a chance if I'm allowed to  -Experience, then Story, then Gameplay, if gameplay is focused around the battling itself and experience is just the overall atmosphere.  Even if I like your story, if I have to meticulously plan out and grind for a specific team to get your past your Random Trainer #276 with 6 lvl 87 Pokemon with superior tactics, only to be faced with an entire Route full of these people, I'm going to give up on it.  -I don't really care about this at all.  -No  -No, unless I'm required to to catch them all (which I don't mind doing at all, but you can bet I'm not going to raise them)"
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,happy_pants_man,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:50:54 2015 UTC,"An excellent and thorough response, thank you!  While it seemed to be a nice thought having EVERY SINGLE POKEMON out of the first 3 generations, Hoenn doesn't have enough room for all of them in my opinion, something I realized after testing the first 3 routes and realizing that no matter how diverse I'm going to run into 20 Voltorbs before a Bulbasaur-and who the hell uses Voltorb anyways when they have access to Mareep, Chinchou, Elekid/Buzz, Magnemite, or even Useless Fat Potato Rat (pet nickname for you know who)?  And then I start thinking about Route 101-does anyone even fucking catch a Rattatta or a Sentret anymore? Personally, out of all the rodents in the first three Zigzagoon was worth a fucking thing, even as an HM/Pickup Slave he has 5x more usefull qualities than Rat or Sen!   Your response is one I was hoping to get back-if I crowd out the early routes with useless low level crap then I'm going to end up having to hold out the really cool, good, or useful pokemon past their usefulness. Personally, once I get to Fortree City my team is almost complete anyways, and once you get Sootopolis you've pretty much hit the end of land-based wild pokemon opportunities until Victory Road and by then it's too late to bother catching something to take on the Elite Four with.   Again, thank you! Your response has evoked new thoughts and exciting possibilities within myself-and I've rediscovered just why I'm hacking Emerald again-to put the pokemon I love in the region I love (second only to Johto) in a way a Randomizer can't! Man, I can't wait to redo the encounter lists this weekend!"
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,happy_pants_man,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:34:21 2015 UTC,"Hoenn doesn't have enough room for all of them in my opinion,   This is a great idea I wish more people would implement in their more ambitious projects.  There is nothing wrong with a limited subset of the pokedex, as long as I can fairly capture all of your Pokemon and I'm not given a national dex to tempt me into catching things I can't catch.  If anything, it would help me be more aware of how useful other Pokemon can be (or how useless they might be).  I'm an older player, so I definitely fit in a rigid trinity of 1) prefer my starter all the time, 2) prefer Gen I that I've gotten to know, 3) prefer only current gen new to the current game I'm on.  Everything in between gets largely ignored except for the purposes of dex-filling, so forcing me to use a mixture would be nice.  Now, if you put a bunch of bird types in one area, I'm going after that Pidgey because that's what Supreme Lord & Commander Ash Ketchum used, and I definitely modeled my early Pokemon career after his choices.  But you could force a Ratata to be in an area to represent Gen I while something else I ignored (basically everything given Pidgey's frequency) representing the early game bird, and move Pidgey somewhere else.  So a healthy mixture of the three gens represented in each area would be great."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,The_Looker,2,Sat Jun 6 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"-I don't care about filling the Dex, but I do want to have a different experience from everyone else playing your hack so it's important to have that sort of variety in the wild Pokemon. -I tend to play Nuzlocke, so it's typically just about what I end up with. But if I am just playing through a game without the Challenge, I try to put an emphasis on things I've never used before with one or two favorites to round out the team. -Well, those all go hand in hand. The story fuels the player's desire to get through the gameplay and is the main vessel of the gameplay and the over all experience is a combination of both elements. You really can't just eschew one or two of these to focus on the remaining ones because that will have a big impact on the rest. If you have a bad story, people will be deterred from seeing what the rest of the game is about beyond, like, the second gym. If you don't care about making the gameplay good and BALANCED people can and will give up when things get boring and/or just stupid. If you don't spend time on crafting the over all experience, even if you have great things going with the other two elements, it will still feel like you're playing a hack of Fire Red or Emerald or what have you instead of an original creation. -Buffs are appreciated, as the majority of the Pokemon I haven't used and a significant number of my favorites are ones which most would typically overlook and buffing them gives people a reason to actually give them a chance. But they aren't really necessary for the majority of Pokemon unless you're planning a difficulty based hack. (In which case I would argue you're missing the point of this whole thing, but that's a rant for another time :P). -I don't EV train unless there's an easy way to do it and/or the game makes it absolutely necessary. Again, this is a matter of whether you make the game reasonably difficult or excessively difficult. -As is, I don't typically breed in hacks because I'm there for a playthrough and that's it. However, if you can implement interesting new features to give people an incentive to breed, I'd be all for it! I breed a lot in the main games and I'd be very interested to see what you can do to make it fresh!"
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,The_Looker,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:18:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback-I understand the importance of variety, as pokemon is a fairly linear game.   As for story, right now the hack I'm working on doesn't deviate from the factory model AT ALL-it's a basic Emerald hack with different pokemon and a slight bump in difficulty. This is me jumping into hacking. I have an ambitious story-heavy hack in mind and this hack is the testing ground for the gameplay of that hack, testing for things like stat buffs, some slight type tweaking (I'm going to make Gyarados Water/Dragon and might make Charizard Fire/Dragon but that is still very controversial), as well as learning the ropes of hacking as I go.   So I suppose then it is just a hack of Emerald, even if it is really good it won't be set far apart from the run of the mill difficulty hack. Your feedback as the consumer helps me understand what is and is not important to focus on, and I know people might get hyped as I post updates but really it's a hack for me and people like me-people who are fine with the main series story but feel they could do it better, have a better experience, with a broader range of options, people who don't really care about getting into the math of it all and employ only basic strategy to win-casual players. Why the hell should I have to grind away and EV train just to beat a stupid Gym leader? I should be able to use my rock to smash his scissors and move on! I'm not a fan of grinding, and editing stats would help work around that with certain pokemon. I played a Crystal Nuzlocke once that ended when all I had left was a level 40 Butterfree that couldn't get past Jasmine's Steelix. It was 8 levels over with a useful moveset and didn't have weakness to steel, it should have won-but Butterfree is fucking weak compared to a Steelix no matter how you slice it.   Sorry for the rambling."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,The_Looker,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:50:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I can definitely get behind this sort of hack as it is your first and sometimes it can be nice to just play a redone version of a vanilla game. But do keep in mind my comments on story, gameplay, and the over all experience when you get to your more ambitious project! I'd definitely advocate that, even as you work on this project, spend some time planning out how you want that other project to go so that if/when you do get around to it you don't find yourself cobbling things together just for the sake of having something. And you have no idea how glad I was to see that you're not one of those (not naming any names) sorts who goes ""I'm going to give every gym leader a full team, a perfect moveset, competitive held items, and max EVs"" because, as you said, that just isn't fun and basically requires that the player do things in a very exact way to even have a shot at winning. On the mentioned subject of Gyarados and Charizard being Dragons, I'd say it should mostly be based on when you're likely to get them and how hard it would be to do so. Like I could see Charizard working assuming it's like Ralts or Bagon in vanilla Emerald where it's a very rare encounter in one specific area, rather than a starter or gift or something. But unless you really overhaul both Gyarados and Magikarp, I'd say you'd be better off just giving Gyarados more ways to make use of its Flying type since Dragon is supposed to be this powerful, rare, mysterious type so it seems wrong to give it to the evolution of literally the most common Pokemon in the game."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,The_Looker,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:07:47 2015 UTC,"On the Gyarados thing-wow, I didn't even consider that. You're too right, even though it looks like a Chinese dragon it's not mysterious or really rare at all!   I plan on putting Charmanders around the volcano, probably the last Starter to catch wild, something that won't help you beat Flannery but by the time you evolve it there still won't be many dragons. I didn't consider how rare dragon types should be, now that I think of it there are only 3 dragon lines in the first 3 generations (Flygon, Dragonite, and Salamence-I might be missing one) and out of them all only 1 can be caught prior to the 8th badge (maybe Dratini was in the Safari Zone, I forget)  As for Leaders, I do want to give them teams of 6 because just 3 feels a little anti-climactic and Omega Fire Red's leaders could be tough at times when they throw out the curveball Pokémon (Brock's Vulpix, Erika's Blissey, Surge and Misty with TM/HM move MVPs)-then again, when it comes to difficulty, Complex Crystal upped the level curve too steeply without supplying sufficient grinding material-I'm supposed to tackle Level 60s Rocket Grunts when all I can grind against are fucking level 30 Furrets and Pidgeots? Which caused me to abandon a good team and give up on that hack. I just renovated the encounter lists all the way to Petalburg and thought the wild levels were just fine, despite being tougher than the trainers in the area (whom I haven't edited yet) and paid out decent experience, enough that the escalation (2-5 on Routes 101 and 103, 4-8 on 102, 8-10 on 104, 7-14 with one 10-20 and two 8-14s in Petalburg Woods) wasn't hard with a single pokemon lightly grinding with a Lucky Egg (starter held item; should I change that for the official release?)  Escalating difficulty without just throwing up ""haha high lvl hax movepool noob lol IVs lol EVs lol"" doesn't seem very hard."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,PunsAreFun,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about your last point on difficulty, it's just that many hackers tend to not recognize that. On the gym leader teams, maybe I'd suggest doing 4 or 5 for Roxanne and possibly Brawly? After all, more often than not players won't even have a solid, full team for themselves at that point so it doesn't seem too good of an idea to do that for the Leaders. For the TMs they use, a good rule of thumb is that (aside from the Gym's TM) if the player can't or shouldn't be able to use it at that point then the NPCs probably shouldn't either. So it'd be fine if Roxanne had, say, a Lileep with Bullet Seed to help against Water types, but not okay if she had a Geodude with Earthquake. I'd say you could get away with throwing in curveballs like in FRO, but I'd air on the side of caution because in that case it was mainly things which have some known connection to the character from other media. I'm not particularly aware of such things for the Hoenn leaders and Elite 4, but if you have ideas that have some reason behind them then I could certainly see it working. I don't see things particularly worrying about that level curve, though I would say lower that 10-20 to 10-16 since I'm thinking at that point the player's team would probably be in the low to mid teens so a sudden level 20 might be more than they can handle. Of course, that depends on what Pokemon it is but that just seems like something that sticks out to me. I'd certainly say you could keep the Lucky Egg on the starters, since not having it in a hack that changes the level curve is basically making grinding take longer just for its own sake."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,PunsAreFun,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:02:06 2015 UTC,"It's a level 10-20 (or 18, I forget) Scyther; two flying types and possibly an electric are available before that (Pidgey, Natu, and Mareep as a starter)"
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,thepenguin394,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"In that case, I guess I'd say 10-16 should work out better, though I'd honestly be somewhat uncertain about having Scyther available that early at all; it has the same BST as Scizor (with 110 physical attack and 105 speed) with the only differences being the obvious typing change and Scizor having those stats redistributed to focus on bulk after evolution. So you have something that's on par with some of the better fully evolved Pokemon whose only real disadvantage is its severe Rock allergy and its lacking movepool in Gen III, though I assume you'd probably be fixing that."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,EchoingSong,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK. I wanted it to be like a big bad boss; a one off extremely hard to catch encounter would be better if I can implement it.   So perhaps I should substitute a Beedrill instead, as Weedle is catchable in the same area so it'd make sense."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,EchoingSong,2,Sun Jun 7 02:03:37 2015 UTC,Not sure of the general age range of this sub but I'm guessing I'm a bit above the average (I was half way through elementary school when Red/Blue came out) so I really only hang with the original 151 or 251.    I don't care about filling out the entire PokeDex but I strongly believe in having the option to. In the couple hacks I've made all trade evolutions evolve at level 40 and all 151 or 251 can be caught. Hacks with more than that I think can be an exception to the rule because of the sheer amount of wild battle variety/events you'd need to catch them all. I normally play with favorites because some Pokemon are just better than others. If/when I make a new hack a big focus on it is going to be a balance between all tier 3 Pokemon. I understand why there isn't (I shouldn't be able to catch a fire Pokemon stronger than my starter Charizard) but I think that in the world of rom hacks balance is more important. I think that in official releases the gameplay is more important because they have the ability and teams to release a higher level of quality than most rom hacks can achieve plus the ability for innovation. In rom hacks I think the story or atmosphere is more important because it's what's going to distinguish most hacks from one another because we're all using the same design tools (more or less). I would balance my hack in a tier system where Raticate wouldn't be able to hang with a Gengar but it should be able to hang with a Haunter. It'd be a ton or work and testing but that's my ideal world. I do not EV train. I started way before that was a thing people did and I don't see the point. I used to because I was so excited to see it when G/S first came out but since then I don't really. It's cool that you can do it but the babies aren't worth the time and effort to raise up to a full evolution. If I was going to include it in one of my hacks I would have them learn a new powerful skill set to help incentivize breeding.
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,XxXpheniox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback.   What I'm getting is that most of us playing hacks don't really care about EV training, we're playing the game the way we want without worrying about math.   I don't see the point in breeding in a hack unless you know what you're doing and you just want the best of the best of the best pokemon you're trying to get from it.   I've decided to drop certain pokemon from the hack, such as the Sentret and Rattata lines. Personally I don't see much use in the worm bug lines but their evos are cool and they are basic+2 stage pokemon, which have always been my favorite kind. The ones I drop I'm going to try to use to add in certain post-gen 3 evos like Magmortar, Electivire, etc. Most weaker pokemon that do evolve from an evolver will have stats buffed, as well as all the baby types to make them worth a damn, and solo stage non-evolvers that remain. I would like a Beedrill and a Butterfree to go toe to toe with a Steelix or drop a Haunter without desperation and overdosing on potions.   I think you're right-a certain amount is enough after 250. Even 300 seems to be pushing it-so certain pokemon are going to fill the void left by others, pokemon normally overlooked because they are mid-game and past being play-ready useful."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,1-800-948-8488,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:45:32 2015 UTC,The only danger in taking out Pokemon is that you might be taking out someone's favorites even if you don't like it yourself. There's something to be said about making the game you want to make but as far as reception goes you have to consider that.
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,XxXpheniox,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"You make a good point I have been considering, though there should be enough Pokemon for everyone who plays to have a few favorites around."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,XxXpheniox,2,Sun Jun 7 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"I only tend to fill the dex if it's a hack which has a completely fill-able dex, I wouldn't put all that effort in to be missing like 10 Pokemon.  I try to make a team of Pokemon that I don't usually use, and for that I really like when stats, abilities, and movesets are changed to make nearly every Pokemon viable.  Story is interesting, and I'd much rather play a hack with a new story than just another fire red run through.  I don't EV train or breed."
PokemonROMhacks,38rtkl,XxXpheniox,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for quick, concise answers. I'm feeling very much at ease about tweaking stats and not worrying about trying to appeal to minmaxers."

PokemonROMhacks,38n5m3,27thColt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"It is freezing because you need to assign the green Script tile in Advance Map with a variable.  In Advance Map, the Script tiles have two fields. Scripts will only activate when the variable in the ""Variable"" field is at the value in the ""Value"" field; for example, if you put 4050 in the ""Variable"" field and 0000 in the ""Value"" field, the script will only ever execute when the variable 0x4050 is equal to 0. Therefore, if it isn't equal to 0, the script won't activate, so you don't actually need the part of your script that checks if the flag is set. Instead, just start the script from @stop, and assign the tile a variable and value, and replace wherever it is you set 0x853 to instead set the variable to a different value.  Incidentally, when using flags, it's best to stick to the range of 0x200 to 0x2FF; those above begin to overlap with the memory location used for Trainer flags and variables, and can often lead to bugs such as Bad Egg generation and whatnot. This is all explained in more detail here: http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=302347  Also, if you're not too far into your hack, I'd recommend starting over using Emerald as your base instead of Ruby. Emerald is basically better in every way; it has newer features, expansion of its Pokédex is far easier and well-documented, you have the music, items and bug fixes from FR/LG at your disposal, and nowadays more and more development is done exclusively for FireRed and Emerald due Ruby's obsolescence.  Finally, I'd recommend downloading cosarara's Red Alien Script Editor; it's multi-platform, so should run natively on your Mac, and supports the syntax of both XSE and PKSVUI, so you will be bale to compile regardless of the format.  As for your script itself, it is fine but I would recommend using Red Alien and then adding the waitmovement commands, and reverting to the faster msgbox syntax (i.e., without callstd). You should also remove the spaces before ""\p"" or ""\n"", as they won't be visible onscreen and will just waste space.  Finally, and this is more a personal gripe than a technical issue, I would recommend using the proper formatting and grammar that the official games use, for consistency. For example, type Pokémon (or POKéMON if you're not decapitalising the rest of the game), and use the ""[.]"" character instead of three full stops for your ellipsis. String @2 is also grammatically awkward, so I'd recommend rewriting that, too.  Good luck, and I hope I've helped!

PokemonROMhacks,38n5m3,sphericalice,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"You can indeed import maps!

The creator never properly implemented Solar Power, so when they send out Helioptile in the sun, the game crashes.  And yes, that DOES mean abilities are in. Things just get a bit wonky at times."
